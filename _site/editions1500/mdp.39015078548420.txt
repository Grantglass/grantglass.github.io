 THE
LIFE

ADV ENTUR E S
b F
ROBINSON CRUSOE,
 Was born in the Year irfjz, in the
City of York, of a good Family, tho'
not of that Country, my Father be-
ing a Foreigner otBremau, who fettled
firft at Hull: He got a good Eftate
by Merchandize, and leaving off his
Trade, lifced afterward at Tork, from whence he had
married my Mother, whofe Relations were*named
Robinfon, a very good. Family in that Country, and
from whom I was call'd Robinfon Kreutz,naer; but by
the ufual Corruption of Words in England, we are
now call'd, nay we call our felve$, and write our
Namet>a/o?,and To myCompanions always eall'd me;
B I had
that thtefe things were all either too far above me,
or too far below me; that mine was the middle
State, or what might be called the upper Station
of Low Life, which he had found by long Experience
was the beft State in the World, the moft fuited to
human Happinefs, not expofedto the Miferiesand
Hardfhips, the Labour and Sufferings of the me-
chanick Part of Mankind, and not embarafs'd with
the Pride, Luxury, Ambition and Envy of the up-
per Part of Mankind* He told me, I might judge
of the Happinefs of this State, by this one thing,
viz,. That this was the State of Life which all
other People envied; that Kings have frequently la-
mented the miferable Confequences of being born
to great Things, and wifh they had been placed
in the Middle of the two Ejftremes, between the
Mean and the Great; that the wife Man gave his
Teftimony to this as the juft Standard of true Fe-
licity, when he prayed to have neither Poverty or
Riches.
He bid me obferve it, and I fhould always findj
that the Calamities of Life were fhared among the
upper and lower Part of Mankind ; but that the
middle Station had the feweft Difafters, and was
not expos'd to fo many Viciffitudes as the higher or
lower Part of Mankind ; nay, they were not fubje*
cted to fo many Diftempers and Uneafinefles either
of Body or Mind, as thofe were, who by vicious
Living, Luxury and Extravagancies on one Hand,
or by hard Labour, want of Neceflaries, and mean
or infufficient Diet on the other Hand, bring Di-
ftempers upon themfelves by the natural Confequen*
ces of their Way of Living ; That the middle Sta-
tion of Life was calculated for all kind of Virtues
and all kind of Enjoyments ; that Peace and Plen-
ty were the Hand-maids of a middle Fortune;
tliat Temperance, Moderation, Quietnefs,Health,

vail, his young Defires prompting him to run into
the Army where he was kill 'd ; and tho' he fai^
he would not ceafe to pray for me, yet he wouP
venture to fay to me, that if I did take this foolifh
Step, God would not blefs me, and I would have
Le.ifure heteafcer to reflect upon having neglected
his Counfel when there might be none to aflift in
my Recovery.
I obferved in this laft Part of. his .Difcourfe,
which was truly Prophetick, tho' I fuppofe my Fa-
ther did not know it to be fo himfelr'; I fay, I ob-
ferved the Tears run down his Face very plentiful-
ly, and efpedally when he fpokc of my Brother
who was kill'd f^and that when he fpok,e of my ha-
ving Leifure to repent, and none to aflift me, he
was fo mov'd, that he broke oft the Difcourfe, and
told me, his Heart was fo full, he could fay no
more to me.
I was lincerely affeded with this Difcourfe, as
indeed who could be otherwife ? and I refolv'd not
to think of going Abroad any more, but to fettle
at Home according to my Father's Defire. But
alas! a few Days wore it all off; and in fhort, to
prevent any of my Father's farther Importunities,
in a few Weeks after, I refolv'd to run quite away
from him. However, I did not act fo haftily neither
as my firft Heat of Refolution prompted, but I took
my Mother, at a time when I thought her a little
pleaferiter than ordinary, and told her, that my
Thoughts were fo entirely bent upon feeing the
World, that I fhould never fettle to any thing with
Rclblution enough to go through with it, and my
Father had better give me his Confent than force
me to go without it; that I was now Eighteen
Years old, which was too ]ate to go Apprentice to
a Trade, or Clerk to an Attorney ; that I was fure,
if I did, I mould never ferve out my Time, and I
B 3 fhould
one of my Companions being going by Sea t'o Lou-
don, in his Father's Ship, and prompting me to go
with them, with the common Allurement of Seafa-
ring Men, viz* That it fhould coft me nothing for
my Paffage, I confulted neither Father or Mother
any more, rior fo much as fent them Word of it; but
leaving them to hear of it as they might, without
asking God's Bleffing, or my Father's, without any
Confideration of Circumftances or Confequences,
and in an ill Hour, God knows, on the firft of Sep-
tember 1651, I went on board a Ship bound for Lon-
don ; never any young Adventurer's Misfortunes, I
believe, began fooner, or continued longer than mine.
The Ship was no fooner gotten out of the Humber,
but the Wind began to blow, and the Winds to rife
in a moft frightful manner; and as I had never
been at Sea before, I was moft inexpreffible fick in
Body, and terrify'd in my Mind: I began now fe-
rioully to retted: upon what I had done, and how
juftly I was overtaken by the Judgment of Heaven
for my wicked leaving my Father's Houfe, and a-
bandoning my Duty; all the good Counfel of my
Parents, my Father's Tears and my Mother's En-
treaties came now frefh into my Mind, and my
Confcience, which was not yet come to the Pitch
of Hardnefs to which it has been fince, reproach'd
me with the Contempt of Advice, and the Breach
of my Duty to God and my Father.
All this while the Storm encreas'd, and the Sea,
which I had never been upon before, went very high,
tho' nothing like what I have feen many times
fince; no, nor like what I faw a few Days after .•
But it was enough to affect me then, who was but
a young Sailor, and had never known any thing of
the Matter. I expeded every Wave would have
fwallowed us up, and that every time the Ship fell
down, as I thought, in the Trough or Hollow
84' of
L9l
Wind ? A Capful! d'you call it ? faid I, 'twas a terri-
ble Storm : A Storm, you Fool you, replies he, do you
catt that a Storm, -why it was nothing at all; give us but
a good Ship and Sea-room, and we think nothing of fucb
a. Squal of Wind as that; but iour e Init.afrejh Water
Saillor, Bob; come let «.r make a Bowl of Punch and
we II forget all that; d'ye fee what charming Weather 'tis
now ? To make fhort this fad Part of my Story,
we went the old way of all Sailors, the Punch" was
made, and I was made drunk with it, and in that
one Night's Wickednefs I drowned all. my Repen-
tance, all my Reflections upon my paft Conduct,
and all my Refolutions for my future. In a word,
as the Sea was returned to its Smoothnefs of Sur-
face and fettled Calmnefs by the Abatement of that
Storm, fo the Hurry of my Thoughts being over,
my Fears and Apprehenfions of being fwallow'd up
by the Sea being rorgotten, and the Current of my
former Defires return'd, I entirely forgot the Vows
and Promife.s that I made in my Diftrcfs. I found
indeed fome Intervals of Reflection, and theierious
Thoughts did, as it were, endeavour to return a*
gain fometimes, but I Ihook them off, and rouz'd
my felf from them as it were from a Diilemper,
and applying my felf to Drinking and Company,
foon matter'd the Return of thofe Fits, for fo I
call'd them, and I had in five or fix Days got as
compleata Victory over Confcience as any young
Fellow that refolv'd not to be troubled with it,
could deiire: But I was to have another Trial for
it ftiil; and Providence, as in fuch Cafes generally
it does, refolv'd to leave me entirely without Excufe.
For if I would not take this for a Deliverance, the
next was to be fuch a one as the worft and moft
harden'd Wretch among us would tonfefs both the
Danger and the Mercy.
The
 [II]
Hurries, I was ftupid, lying {till in my Cabbin,
which was in the Steerage, and cannot defcribe my
Temper.. I could ill re-aflume the firft Penitence
which I had fo apparently trampled upon, and har-
den'd my felf againft : I thought the Bittternefs of
Death had been pail, and that this would be no-
think too like the firft. But when the Mafter him-
felf came by me, as I faid juft now, and faid we
fhould be all loft, I was dreadfully frighted : I got
up out of my Cabbin, and look'dout; but fucha
difinal Sight I never faw: The Sea went Mountains
high, and broke upon us every three or four Mi-
nutes : When I could look about, I could fee no-
thing but Diilrefs round us : Two Ships that rid
near us, we found, had cut their Mails by the
Board, being deep loaden; and our Men cry d out,
that a Ship which rid about a Mile a-Head of us
was foundered. Two more Ships being driven from
their Anchors, were run out of the Roads to Sea,
at all Adventures, and that with not a Maft {land-
ing. The light Ships fared the beft, as not fo much
labouring in the Sea ; but two or three of them
drove, and came clofe by us, running away with
only their Sprit-fail out before the Wind.
Towards Evening the Mate and Boatfwain
begg'd the Mafter of our Ship to let them cut a-
way the Fore-matt, which he was very unwilling
to.. But the Boatfwain protefting to him, that if he
did not, the Ship would founder, he confented j
and when they had cut away the Fore-maft, the
Main-maft flood fo loofe, and fhook the Ship fo
much, they were obliged to cut her away alfo, and
make a clear Deck.
Any one may judge what a Condition I muft be
in at all this, who was but a young Sailor, and
who had been in fuch a Fright before at but a lit-
tle. But if I can exprefs at this Diftance the
Thoughts
dreadful thing happen'd. In a word, I was fo fur-
prized, that I fell down in a Swoon. As thi*
was a time when every Body had'his own Life t6
think of, no Body minded me, or what was become
of me; but another Man ftept up to the Pump, and
thruftingme afide with his Foot, let me lye, think-
ing I had been Dead ; and it was a great while
before I came to my felf.
We work'd on, but the Water encreafing in the
Hold, it was apparent that the Ship would founder,
and cho' the Storm began to abate a little, yet as
it was not poffible fhe could fwim till we might run
into a Port, fo the Mafter continued firing Guns for
Help ; and a light Ship who had rid it out juft a
Head of us, ventured a Boat out to help us. It was
with the utmoft hazard the Boat came near us, but
it was impoffible for us to get on Board, or for the
Boat to Me near the Ship Side, till at laft the Men
rowing very heartily, and venturing their Lives to
fave ours, our Men catt them a Rope over the Stern
with a Buoy to it, and then vered it out a great
Length, which they after great Labour and Hazard
took hold of, and we haul'd them clofe under our
Stern and got all into their Boat. It was to no
Purpofe for them or us after we were in the Boat to
think of reaching to their own Ship, fo all agreed
to let her drive, and only to pull her in towards
Shore as much as we could, and our Mafter pro-
mifed them, That if the Boat was ftav'd upon
Shore he would make it good to their Mafter, fo
partly rowing and partly driving, our Boat went a-
way to the Norward, (leaping towards the Shore
almoft as far as Wmterton-Ncfs.
We were not much more than a quarter of an
Hour out of our Ship but we faw her.fink, and
then I underftood for the firft time what was meant
by a Ship foundering in the Sea ; I muft acknow-
ledge
 [15]
no Power to do it. I know not what to call this, nor
will I urge, that it is a fecret over-ruling Decree
that hurries us on to be the Inftruments of our own
Definition, even tho' it be before us, and that we
pufh upon it with our Eyes open. Certainly no-
thing but fome luch decreed unavoidable Mifery
attending, and which it was impoffible for me to
efcape, could have pufh'd me forward againft the
calm Reafonings and Perfwafions of my moft re-
tired Thoughts, and againft two fuch vifible In-
ftructions as I had met with in my firft Attempt.
My Comrade, who had help'd to harden me be-
fore, and who was the Mafter's Son, was now lefs
forward than I; the firft time he fpoke to me after
we were at Yarmouth, which was not till two or
three Days, for we were feparated in the Town
to feveral Quarters; I fay, the firft time he faw me,
it appear'd his Tone was alter'd, and looking very
melancholy, and fluking his Head, ask'd me how
I did, and telling his Father who I was, and how
I had come this Voyage only for a Tryal, in order
to go farther abroad; his Father turning to me
with a very grave and concern'd Tone, Young Man,
fays he, you ought never to go to Sea any more, you ought
to take this for a plain and vifible "Token that you are
not to be a Seafaring Man. Why, Sir, faid I, will you
go to Sea no more ? 'That is another Cafe, faid he,
it is my Calling, and therefore my Duty; but as you made
this Voyage for a Tryal, you fee what a Tafte Heaven has
given you of what you are to expett if you perfift ; perhaps
this is all befallen us on your Account, like Jonah in the
Ship of Tarftufh. Pray, continues he, what are you*
and on what Account did you go t« Sea ? Upon that I
told him fome of my Story ; at the End of which he
burft out with a ftrange kind of Palfion, What had
I done, fays he, that fuch an unhappy Wretch fhould
come into my Ship j . I would not fet my Foot in
the
[I?]
the Remembrance of the Diftrefs I had been in
wore off; and as that abated, the little Motion I
had in my Defires to a Return wore off with it,
till at laft I quite laid afide the Thoughts of it,
and look'd out for a Voyage.
That evil Influence which carried me firir. away
from my Father's Houfe, that harried me into the
wild and indigefted Notion of raifmg my Fortune ;
and that impreft thofe Conceits fo forcibly upon
me, as to make me deaf to a;] good Advice, and
to the Entreaties and even the Command of my Fa-
ther: I fay the fame Influence, whatever it wast
prefented the moft unfortunate of all Enterprizes
to my View; and I went on board aVefiel bound
to the Coaft of Africa; or as our Sailors vulgarly
call it, a Voyage to Guiney.
. It was my great Misfortune that in all thefe
Adventures I did not /hip my felf as a Sailor;
whereby, tho' 1 might indeed have work'd a little
harder than ordinary, yet at the fame time I had
learn'd the Duty and Office of a Fore-maft Man»
and in time might have qualified my felf for a
Mare or Lieutenant, if not for a Mailer. But as
it was always my Fate to choofe for the worfe,
fo I did here; for having Money in my Pocket,
and good Cloaths upon my Back, I would always
go on board in the Habit of a Gentleman ; andfo
I neither had any Bufinefs in the Ship, or learn'd to
do any.
It was my Lo't firft of all to fall into pretty good
Company in London, which does not always hap-
pen to fuch loofeand unguided young Fellows as I
then was; the Devil generally not omitting to lay
fome Snare for them very early: But it was not fo
with me, Ifirft fell acquainted with the Mafter of
a Ship who had been on the Coaft ot Guin?y; and
who having had very good Succefs there, was re- •
C folvsd
[19]
Yet even in this Voyage I had my Misfortunes
too; particularly, that I was continually Sick, be-
ing thrown into a violent Calenture by the exceffive
Heat of the'Qinute ; our principal Trading being
upon the Coaft, from the Latitude of 15 Degrees,
North even to the Line it felf.
I was now fet up for a Guiney Trader; and my
Friend, to my great Misfortune, dying foon after his
Arrival, I relblved to go the fame Voyage again,
and I embark'd in the fame Veflel with one who was
his Mate in the former Voyage, and had now got
the Command of the Ship. This was the unhap-
pieft Voyage that ever Man made; for tho' I did
not carry quite 100 /. of my new gain'd Wealth,
fo that 1 had 200 left, and which I lodg'd with
my Friend's Widow, who was very juft to me, yet
I fell into terrible Misfortunes in this Voyage; and
the firft was this, viz,. Our Ship making her Courfe
towards the Canary Iflands, or rather between thofe
Iflands and the African Shore, was furprized in the
Grey of the Morning, by zTurki/b Rover of Sallee,
who gave Chafe to us with all the Sail fhe could
make. We crowded alfq as much Canvafs as our
Yards would fpread, or our Mafts Gerry, to have
got clear; b, ut rinding the Pirata gain'd upon us,
and would certainly come up with us in a few
Hours, we prepar a to fight; our Ship having 12
Guns, and the Rogue 18- About three in the Af-
ternoon he came up with us, and bringing too by
Miftake, juft athwart our Quarter, inflead of a-
thw art our Stern, as he intended, we brought 8 of
our Guns to bear on that Side, and pour'd in a
Broadfide upon him, which made him fheer qflfa-
gain, after return ing our Fire, and pouring in alfo
his fm.aU Shot from near 200 Men which he had on
Board. However, we had not a Man touch'd, all
our Men keeping clofe. He prepar'd to attack us
C ^ again
little Garden, and do the common Drudgery of
Slaves about his Houfe; and when he came home
again from his Cruife, he ordcr'd me to lye in the
Cabbin to look after the Ship.
Here I meditated nothing but my Efcape; and
what Method I might take to eftect it, but found
no Way that had the leaft Probability in it: No-
thing pre fen ted to make the Suppofition of it ratio-
nal; 'for I had no Body to communicate it to, that
would embark with me, no Fellow-Slave, no Eng-
Ijjhmany Irifiman, or Scot/man there but my felf > fo
that for two Years, tho? I often pleafed my felf with
the Imagination, yet I never had the leaft encoura-
ging Profpect of putting it in Practice.
After about two Years an odd Circumflance pre-
fented it felf, which put the old Thought of ma-
king fome Attempt for my Liberty, again in my
Head.. My Patron lying at Home longer than ufu-
al, withou t fitting out his Ship, which, as I heard,
was for want of Money; he ufed conftantly, once
or twice a Week, fometimes oftner, if the Weather
was fair, to take the Ship's Pinnace, and go out
into the Road a-fifhing; and as he always took me
2nd a young Marefco with him to row the Boat, we
made him very merry, and I prov'd very dexterous
in catching Fifh; infomuch that fometimes he
would fend me with a Moor, one of his Kinfmen,
and the Youth the Marefco as they cali'd him, t|D»
catch a Difh of Fifh for him.
It happen'd one time, that going a fifhing in a
ftark calm Morning, a Fog rofe fo thick, that tho'
we were not half a League from the Shore we loft
Sight of it; and rowing we knew not whither or
which way, w? labour'd all Day, and all the next,
Night, and when the Morning came we found we
had pull'd'off to Sea inftead of pulling in for the
Shore; and that we were at leaft twoLeagu.es from
C 3
clean, her Antfent and Pendants out, and every
thing to accommodate his Guefts; when by and by
my Patron came on board alone, and told me his
Gnefts had put oft" going, upon fome Bufinefs that
fell out, and order'd me with the Man and Boy,
as ufual, to go out with the Boat and catch them
fome Fifh, for that his Friends were to fup at his
Houfe; and commanded that as foon as I got fome
Fifh I fhould bring it home to his Houfe; all which
I prepar'd to do.
This Moment my former Notions of Delive-
rance darted into my Thoughts, for now I found I
was like to have a little Ship at my Command; and
my Matter being gone, 1 prepar'd to furnifh my
felf, not for fifhing Bufinefs, but for a Voyage;
tho' I knew not, neither did I fo much asconlider
whither I mould fteer; for any where to get out
of that Place was my Way.
My firft Contrivance was to make a Pretence to
fpeak to this Moor, to get fomething for our Sub-
fiftance on board ; for I told him wemuft not pre-
fume to eat of our Patron's Bread; he faid, that
was true ; fo he brought a large Basket of Rusk
or Bisket of their kind, and three Jarrs with frefh
Water into the Boat; I knew where my Patron's
Cafe of Bottles flood, which it was evident by
the make were taken out of fome English Prize; and
I convey'd them into the Boat while the Moor was
on Shore, as if they had been there before, for our
Mafter: I convey'd alfo a great Lump of Bees-
Wax into the Boat, which weighed above half a
Hundred Weight, with a Parcel of Twine or
Thread, a Hatchet, a Saw, and a Hammer, all
which were of great Ufe to us afterwards; efpe-
cially the Wax to make Candles. Another Trick
I try'd upon him, which he innocently came into
alfo; his Name was Ifmael, who they call Mulyy
C 4 or
.
thing behind him, I took him by fuprize with my
Arm under his Twift, and toil him clear over board
into the Sea ; he rife immediately, for he fwam
like a Cork, and call'd to me, begg'd to be taken.
jn, tpld me he would go all over the World with
me; he fwam fb ftrong after the Boat that he would
have reach'd me very quickly, there being but little
Wind ; upon which 1 ftept into the Cabbin, and
fetching one of the Fowling-pieces I prefented it
at him, and told him, I had done him no Hurt, and
if he would be quiet I would do him none: but
laid I, y ou fwim well enough to reach to the Shore
and the Sea is calm, make the beft of your Way to
Shore, and I will do you no flarm,but if you come
near the Boat I'll (boot you thro' the Head ; for I
am refolved to have my Liberty j fo he turn'd him-
felf about and fwam for the Shore, and I make no
doubt but he reach'd it with Eafe, for he was an
Excellent Swimmer.
I could have been content to ha' taken this Moor
with me, and ha' drown'd the Boy, but there was no
venturing to truft him : When he was gone I turn'd
to the Boy, who they call'd Xury, and faid to
him, Xury, if you will be faithful to me I'll make
you a great Man, but if you will not ftroke your
Face to be true to me, that is,fwear £y Mahomet and
his Father's Beard, I muft throw you into the Sea
too; the Boy fmil'd in my Face, and fpoke foinflo-
cently that 1 could not miftrufi him; and fworeVo
be faithful to me, and go all over the World witfr.
me-
'•" While I was in View of the Moor that was
fwimming, I flood out directly to Sea with the Boat,
rather ftretching to Windward, that they might
think me gone towards the Straits-mouth (as indeed
any one that had been in their Wits muft ha' been fup-
pos'd to do)for who wou'd ha'fuppos'd we were fail'd
OB
Fear, and begg'd of me not to go on Shore till
Day; well Xury, faid I, then I won't, but it may
be we may fee Men by Day, who will be as bad to
us as thofe Lyons ; then we give them thejboot Gun,
fays Xury, laughing, make them run -wey; fuch English
Xury fpoke by converting among us Slaves. Howe-
ves I. was glad to fee the Boy fo cheerful, and I
gave him a Dram (out of our Patron's Cafe of Bot-
tles) to chear him up : After all, Xury's Advice
was good, and I took it, we 4ropp'd our little An-
chor and lay ftill all Night; I fay ftill, for we flept
none ; for in two or three Hours we faw vaft great
Creatures (we knew not what to call them) of
many forts, come down to the Sea-fhore and run in-
to the Water, wallowing and wafhing themfelves
for the Pleafure of cooling themfelves ; and they
made fuch hideous Howlings and Yellings, that I
never indeed heard the like.
Xury was dreadfully frighted, and indeed fowas
I too ; but we were both more frighted when we
heard one of thefe mighty Creatures come fwim-
ming towards our Boat, we could not fee him, but
we might hear him by his blowing to be a mon-
ftrous, huge and furious Beaft; Xury faid it was a
Lyon, and it might be fo for ought I know; but
poor Xury cried to me to weigh the Anchor and
row away; no, fays I, Xury, we can flip our Cable
with the Buoy to it and go off to Sea, they cannot
follow us far; I had no fooner faid fo, but I per-
ceiv'd the Creature (whatever it was) within two
Oars length, which fomething furprized me; how-
ever I immediately ftept to the Cabbin-door, and
taking up my Gun fir'd at him, upon which he im-
mediately turn'd about, and fwam towards the
Shore again.
But it is impoffible todefcribe the horrible Noi-
fes, and hideous Cries and Howlings, that were
raifed
[;*»*.
frighted with forae wild Beaft, and I run forward
towards him to help him, but when I came nearer
to him, I faw fomething hanging over his Shoul-
ders which was a Creature that he had fhot, like a
Hare, but different in Colour, and longer Legs,
however we were very glad of it, and it was very
good Meat; but the great Joy that poor Xury
came with, was to tell me he had found good Wa-
ter, and feen no wild Mans.
But we found afterwards that we need not take
fuch Pains for Water, for a little higher up the
Creek where we were, we found the Water frefli
when the Tide was out, which flows but a little
way up ; fo we rilled our Jarrs and feafted on the
Hare we had killed, and prepared to go on our
Way, having feen no Foot-fteps of any human
Creature in that part of the Country.
As I had been one Voyage to this Coaft before,
I knew very well that the Iflands of the Canaries,
and the Cafe de Verd Iflands alfo, lay not far oft"
from the Coaft. But as I had no Inftruments to
take an Obfervation to know what Latitude we
were in, and not exactly know, or at leaft to re-
member what Latitude they were in ; I knew not
where to look for them, or when to ftand off to Sea
towards them; otherwise I might now eafily have
found fome of thefe Iflands. But my Hope was,
that if I flood along this Coaft till I came to that
Part where the Englifh traced, I fhould find fome of
their Veflels upon their ufual Defign of Trade,
that would relieve and take us in.
By the beft of my Calculation, that Place where
I know was, muft be that Country, which lying be-
tween the Emperor of Morocco's Dominions and the
Negroes, lies waft and uninhabited, except by wild
Beafts; the Negroes having abandon'dit, and gone
farther South for fear of the Moors; and the Meors

bad him lye ftill, and I took our biggeft Gun,
which was almoft Musket-bore, and loaded it with
a good Charge of Powder, and with %wo Slugs,
and laid it down; then I loaded another Gun with
two Bullets, and the third, for we had three Pie-
ces, I loaded with five fmaller Bullets. I took the
beft Aim I could with the firft Piece to have fhot
him into the Head, but he lay fo with his Leg
rais'd a little above his Nofe, that the Slugs hit
his Leg about the Knee, and broke the Bone. He
flatted up growling at firit, but finding his Leg broke
fell down again, and then got up upon three Legs,
and gave the moft hideous Roar that ever I heardi
I was a little furpriz'd that I had not hit him on
the Head ; however I took up the fetond Piece im-
mediately, and tho' he began to move off fir'd a-
gainj and fhot him into the Head, and had the
Pleafure to fee him drop, and make but little Noife,
but lay ftruggling for Life. Then Xury took Heart,
and would have me let him go on Shore : Well, go
faid I; fo the Boy jump'd into the Water, and ta-
king a little Gun in one Hand, fwam to Shore with
the other Hand, and coming clofe to the Creature,
put the Muzzel of the Piece to his Ear, and mot
him into the Head again, which difpatch'd him
quite.
This was Game indeed to us, but this was no
Food, and I was very forry to lofe three Charges of
Powder and Shot upon a Creature that was good
for nothing to us. However Xury faid he would
have fome of him; fo he comes on board, and ask'd
me to give him the Hatchet; for what, Xury, faid
I ? Me cut of hh Head, faid he. However Xury
could not cut oft" his Head, but he cut off a Foot,
and brought it with him, and it was a monftrous
great ojie.
I be-
E3J]
tie* Weapons in their Hands, except one who had A
long Uender Stick, which Xury faid was a Lance,
and that they would throw them a great way with
gobd Aim; fo I kept at a diftance, but talk'd with
them by Signs as well as I could; and particularly
made Signs for fomething to eat, they beckon'd to
me to Hop my Boat, and they would fetch me
fome Meat; upon this I lower'd the top of my
Sail, and lay by, and two of them run up into the
Country, and in lefs than half an Hour came back,
and brought with them two Pieces of dry Flefh
and fome Corn, fuch as is the Produce of their!
Countrey, but we neither knew what the one or the
other was ; however we were willing to accept it,
but how to come at it was our next Difpute, for I
was not for venturing on Shore to them, and they
were as much affraid of us; but they took a fafd
way for us all, for they brought it to the Shore and
laid it down, and went and Hood a great way off
till we fetch'd it on Boardj and then came clofe to
us again.
We made Signs of Thanks to them, for we had
nothing to make them amends; but an Opportuni*
ty offer'd that very Inilant to oblige them won-
derfully* for while we were lying by the Shore,
came two mighty Creatures, one purfuing the other,
(as we took it) with great Fury, from the Mountains
towards the Sea > whether it was the Male purfuing
the Female,or whether they were in Sport or in Rage,
we could not tell, any more than we could tell whe-
ther it was ufual or ftrange, but I believe it was the
latter; becaufe in the firft Place, thofe ravenous
Creatures feldom appear but in the Night; and in
the fecond Place, we found the People terribly
Frighted, efpecially the Women. The Man that
bad the Lance or Dart did not fly from them,
but the reft did; however as the two Creatures

ling to have them take it as a Favour from me,
which when I made Signs to them that they might
take him, they were very thankful for, immediate-
ly they fell to work with him, and tho' they had no
Knife, yet with a fharpen'd piece of Wood they took
off his Skin as readily, and much more readily than
we cou'd have done with a Knife; they offer'd me
fome of the Flefh, which I declined, making as if
I would give it them, but made Signs for the Skin,
which they gave me very freely, and brought me a
great deal more of their Provifion, which tho' I did
not underftand, yet I accepted; then I made Signs
to them for fome Water, and held out one of my
Jarrs to them, turning it bottom upward, to fhew
that it was empty, and that I wanted to have it
filled. They call'd immediately to fome of their
Friends, and there came two Women and brought
a great Veflel made of Earth, and burnt as I fup-
pofe in the Sun ; this they fet down ior me, as be-
fore, and I fent Xury on Shore with my Jarrs, and
filled them all three. The Women were as ftark
naked as the Men.
I was now furnifhed with Roots and Corn, fuch
as it was, and Water, and leaving my friendly Ne-
groes, I made forward for about eleven Days more,
without offering to go near the Shore, till I few
the Land run out a great Lepgth into the Sea, at
about the Diflance of four or five Leagues before
me, and the Sea being very calm, I kept a large
offing to make this Point; at length, doubling the
Point at about two Leagues from the Land, I
faw plainly Land on the other Side to Seaward;
then I concluded , as it was moft. certain indeed,
that this was the Cafe de Verd, and thofe the /-
(lands', call'd from thence Cafe de Verd I/lands.
However they were at a great Diflance, and I
could not well ttU what I had beft to do, for if I
D 2 fhould
{hould be taken with a Frefh of Wind I might
neither reach one or other.
In this Dilemna, as I was very pehfive, I fiept
into the Cabbin, and fat me down, Xury having
the Helm, when on a fudden the Boy cry'd out
Mafter, Mafter, a Ship with a Sail, and the foolifh
Boy was frighted out of his Wits, thinking it
rnuft needs be feme of his Mafter's Ships tent to
purfue us, when, I knew we were gotten far enough
out of their reach. I jump'd out of the Cabbin,
and immediately faw not only the Ship, but what
fbe was, (viz*) that it was a Portuguese Ship, and
as I thought was bound to the Coaft of Guinea for
Negroes. But when I obferv'd the Courfe fte
fteer'd, I was foon convinc'd they were bound
feme other way, and did not defign to come any
nearer to the Shore; upon which I ilretch'd out to
Sea as much as I could, refolving to fpeak with
them if poflible.
With all the Sail I could make I found I fhould'
not be able to come in their Way, but that they
would be gone by, before I could make any Signal
to them; but after I had crowded to the unroft,
md began tadefpair, they it feems faw me by the
ielp of their Perfpe6tive-Glaffes, and that it was
"ome European Boat, which as they fuppofed muft
Belong to fome Ship that was loft, fo they fhort-
ied Sail to let me come up. I was encouraged
with this, and as I had my Patron's Antient on
Board, I made a Waft of it to them for a Signal
tf Diftrefs, and fir'd a Gun, both which they faw,
"or they told me they faw the Smoke, tho' they did
lot hear the Gun; upon thefe Signals they very
iindly brought too, and lay by for me, and in a-
>out three Hours time I came up with them.
They ask'd me what I was, in Portuguefe, and in
tyanifl, and in French, but I underftood none of
them;
[ J7]
them ; but at laft a Scots Sailor who was on board,
call'd to me, and I anfwer'd him, and told him I
was an Engliftiman, that I had made my efcape out
of Slavery from the Moors at Sallee ; then they bad
me come on board, and very kindly took me in,
and all my Goods.
It was an inexpreffible Joy to mef that any one
will believe, that I was thus deliver'd, as lefleem'd
it, from fuch a miferable and almoft hopelefs Con-
dition as I was in, and I immediately offered all I
had to the Captain of the Ship, as a Return for
my Deliverance ; but he generoufly told me, he
would take nothing from me, but that all I had
fhould be deliver'd fafe to me when I came to the
Brafils ; for, fays he, I have fan'd your Life on no o-
ther Terms than I would is glad to be faved myfelf, and
it may one time or other be my Lot to be taken up in the
fame Condition ; befides, faid he, when I carry you to
the Brafils, fo great a way from your own Country, if I
Jhould take from you what you have, you will be ftarved
there, and then 1 only take away that Life I have given.
No, no, Seignor, Inglefe, fays he, Mr. Englifhman,
I -will carry you thither in Chanty, andthofe things will
help you to buy your Subfiftance there, and your Pajfage
home again.
As he was Charitable in his Propofal, fo he was
juft in the Performance to a tittle, for he ordered
the Seamen, that none mould offer to touch any
thing I had ; then he took every thing into his own
Poflemon, and gave me back an exact Inventory of
them, that I might have them, even fo much as
my three Earthen Jarrs.
As to my Boat it was a very good one, and
that he faw, and told me he would buy i£pf me
for the Ship's Ufe, and ask'd me what I wotjld have
FQF it ? I told him he had been fo generous to me
in every thing, that I could not offer to make a-
D 3 ny
ay Price of the Boat, but left it entirely to him,
Lipon which he told me he would give me a Note
af his Hand to pay me 80 Pieces of Eight for it
at Bi.afil, and when it came there, if any one of-
fer'd to give more he would make it up; he ofter'd
me aifo <5o Pieces of Eight more for my Boy Xury,
which I was loath to take, not that I was not wil-
ling to let the Captain have him, but I was very
loath to {ell the poor Boy's Liberty, who had afli-
fted me fo faithfully in procuring my own. How-
ever when I let him know my Reafon, he own'd it
to b.e juft, and offer'd me this Medium, that he
would give the Boy an Obligation to fet him free.
in ten Years, if he turn'd Chriftian ; upon this, and
X*ry faying he was willing to go to him, I let the
Captain have him.
We had a very good Voyage to the Brafils, and
arriv'd in the Bay de Todos los Santo*, or AD-Saints-
Bay, in about Twenty-two Days after. And now
I was once more deliver'd from the moft miferable
of all Conditions of Life, and what to do next
with my felf I was now to confider.
The generous Treatment the Captain gave me,
I can never enough remember; he would take no-
thing of me for my Paflage, gave me twenty Ducats
for the Leopard's Skin, and forty for the Lyon's
Skin which I had in my Boat, and caufed every
rhing I had in the Ship to be punctually deliver'd
me, and what I was witling to fell he bought, fuch
as the Cafe of Bottles, two of my Guns, and a
Piece of the Lump of Bees-wax, for I had made
Candles of the rett; in a word, I made about 220
Pieces of Eight of all my Cargo, and with this
stock I went on Shore in the Brafilo.
I had not been long here, but being recommen-
ied to the Houfe of a good honeft Man like him-
"c!f, who had an Ingeino as they call it; that is, a
Plan-
[39 1
Plantation and a Sugar-Houfe, I lived with him
foine time, and acquainted my felt" by that Means
with the Manner of their planting and making of
Sugar ; and feeing how well the Planters liv'd, and
how they grew rich fuddenly, I refolv'd, if I could
get Licence to fettle there, I would turn Pianter a-
mong them, refolving in the mean time to find out
fome Way to get my Money which I had left in LOK-
don remitted to me. To this Purpofe getting a kind
of a Letter of Naturalization, I purchaled as much
Land that was Uncur'd, as my Money would reach,
and fornvda Plan for my Plantation and Settlement,
and fuch a one as might be fuitable to the Stock
which I propofed to my felf tq receive from England.
I had a Neighbour, a Portuguese of Lisbon, but
born of Englijh Parents, whofe Name was Wetts,
and in much fuch Circumftances as I was. I call
him Neighbour, becaufe his Plantation lay next
to mine, and we went on very fociable together. My
Stock was but low as well as his ; and we rather
planted for Food, than any thing elfe, for about two
Years. However, we began to increafe, and our
Land began to come into Order; fo that the third
Year we planted fome Tobacco, and made each of
us a large Piece of Ground ready for planting Canes
in the Year to come ; but we both wanted Help;
and now I found more than before, I had done
wrong in parting with my Boy Xury.
But alas ! for me to do wrong that never did right,
was no great Wonder : I had no Remedy but to
go on; I was gotten into an Employment quite re-
mote to my Genius, and directiy contrary to the Life
I delighted in, and for which I forfook my Father's
Houfe, and broke thro'all his good Advice; nay,
I was coming into the very middle. Station, or up-
per Degree of low Life, which my Father advifed
me to before; and which if I refolved to go on
D 4 with
with, I might as well ha' ftaid at Home, and never
have fatigu'd my felf in the World as 1 had done';
and I ufed often to fay to my felf, I could ha'
done this as well in England among my Friends, as
ha' gone 5000 Miles off to do it among Strangers
and Savages in a Wiidernefs, and at fuch a Diftance,
as never to hear from any Part of the World that
had the leaft Knowledge of me.
In this manner I ufed to look upon my Condition
with the utmoft Regret. I had no body to con^
verfe with but now and then this Neighbour; no
Work to be done, but by the Labour of my Hands;
and I ufed to fay, I Hv'd juft like a Man caft away
upon fome defolate Ifland, that had no body there
but himfelf. But how juft has it been, and how mould
all Men reflect, that, when they compare their pre-
fent Conditions with others that are worfe, Heaven
may oblige them to make the Exchange, and be
convinc'd of their forrner Felicity, by their Experi-
ence: I fay, how juft has it been, that the truly foli-
tary Life I reflected on in an Ifland of meer Defola-
tion mould be my Lot, who had fo often unjuIUy
compar'd it. with the Life which I then led, in which
had I continued, I had in all Probability been ex-
ceeding prosperous and rich.
I was in fome Degree fettled in my Meafures for
carrying on the Plantation, before my kind Friend
the Captain of the Snip, that took me up at Sea,
went back ; for the Ship remained there in provi-
ding his Loading, and preparing for his Voyage,
near three Months, when telling h'm what little
Stock I had left behind me in Lcndon, he gave me
this friendly andfir.cere Advice,Seign,cr hglefejays he,
For fo he always called me, if > ou will give meLetters,
ind a Procuration here in Form to me, with Orders
:o the Perfon who has your Money in London, to fend
your Effects to Lisbon, to fuch Perfons as I .{hall di-
reft.
, and in fuch Goods as are proper for this Coun-
try, I will bring you the Produce of them, God
willing, at my Return; but fince human Affairs are
all fubject to Changes and Difafters, I would have
you give Orders but for One Hundred Pounds Sterl.
which you fay is Half your Stock, and let the Ha-
zard be run for the firft; fo that if it come fafe,
you may order the reft the fame Way; and if it
mifcarry, you may have the other Half to have Re-
courfe to for your Supply.
This was fo. wholefome Advice, and lookM fo
friendly, that I could not but beconvinc'd it was the
beft Courfe I could take; fo I accordingly prepared
Letters to the Gentlewoman with whom I had left
my Money, and a Procuration to the Portuguese
Captain, as he defired.
I wrote the English Captain's Widow a full Account
of all my Adventures, my Slavery, Efcape, and how
j'had met with the Portugal Captain at Sea, the Hu-
manityof his Behaviour, and in what Condition I»was
now in, with all other neccflary Directions for my
Supply; and when this honeft Captain came to Lisbon,
he found means by fome of the Englijh Merchants
there, to fend over not the Order only, but a full
Account "of my Story to a Merchant at London,
who reprefented it effe&ually to her ; whereupon,
fhe not only delivered the Money, but out of her
own Pocket fent the Portugal Captain a very hand-
fom Prefent for his Humanity and Charity to me.
The Merchant in London vefting this Hundred
Pounds in Englifi Goods, fuch as the Captain had
writ for, fent them directly to him at Lisbon, and he
brought them all fafe to me to the Bmfils, among
which, without my Direction (for I was too young
in my Bufinefs to think of them ) he had taken Care
to have all Sorts of Tools, Iron-Work, and Uten-
fib
fils neceflary for my Plantation, and which were o^
great Ufe to me.
When this Cargo arrived, I thought my Fortune
made, for I was furprized with Joy of it; aud.my
good Steward th^ Captain had laid out the Five
Pounds which my Friend had fent him for a Pre-
, fcnt for himfelf, to purchafe, and bring me over a
Servant under Bond for fix Years Service, and would
not accept of any Confederation, except a little
TobaccOj which I would have him accept, being
of my own Produce.
Neither was this all; but my Goods being all
Englijh Manufactures, fuch as Cloath,. Stuffs, Bays,
and things particularly valuable anddefireable in the .
Country, I found means to fell them to a very great
Advantage ; fo that I may fay, I had more than
four times the Value of my firft Cargo, and was
now infinitely beyond my poor Neighbour, I mran
in the Advancement of my Plantation ; for the firft
x thing I did, I bought me a Negro Slave, and an £«-
vcpean Servant alfo; I mean another befides that
which the Captain brought me from Lisbon,
But as abus'd Profperity is oftentimes made the
very Means of our greateft Adverfity, fo was it with
me. I went on the next Year with great Succefs in
my Plantation : I raifed fifty great Rolls of Tobac-
co on my own Ground, more than I haddifpofed of
for Necellaries among my Neighbours; and thefe
fifty Roils being each of above a looWt. wore
well cur'd and laid by again ft the Return ot the
Fleet from Lisbon : And now incieafing in Bufinefs
and in Wealth, my Head began to be full of Prp-
jectsand Undertakings beyond my Reach; fuch as
.ire, indeed often the .Ruin of the beft Heads io
Bufincfs.
Had
. .
Had I continued in the Station I was now in, I
had room for all the happy things to have yet be-
fallen me, for which my Father fo earneftly recom-
mended a quiet retired Life, and of which he had
fo'fenfibly defcribed the middle Station of Life to
be full of; but other things attended me, and I
was ftill to be the wilful Agent of all my own
Miferies ; and particularly to cncreafe my Fault
and double the Reflexions upon my felf, which in
my future Sorrows I mould have Leifure to make ;
all thefe Mifcarriages were -procured by my appa-
rent obftinate adhering to my foolifh Inclination of
wandrfcig abroad, and purfuing that Inclination, in
contradiction to the cleareft Views ot doing my
felf good in a fair and plain nurfuit of thofe Prof-
pects and thofe Meafures of Life, which Nature
and Providence concurred to prefent me with, and
to make my Duty.
As I had once done thus in my breaking away
from my Parents, fo I could not be content now,
but I muft go and leave the happy View I had of
being a rich and thriving Man in my new Plantati-
on, only to purfue a rafh and immoderate Defire of,
rifing fafler than the Nature ot the Thing admit-
ted ; and thus I caft my felf down again into the
deepeft Gulph of human Mifery that ever Man fell
into, or perhaps could be confident with Life and
a State*of Health in the World.
* To come then by the juft Degrees, to the Parti-
culars of this Part of my Story ; you may fuppofe,
that having now lived almoft four Years in the
Era/Ho, and beginning to thrive and profper very
well upon my Plantation ; I had not only learn'd
the Language, but had contracted Acquaintance
and Eriendfhip among my Fellow-Planters, as well
as among the Merchants at. St. Sahadore, which
was' our Port; and that in my Difcourfes among
them,
[441
them, I had frequently given them an Account of
my two Voyages to the Coaft of Guinea, the
manner of Trading with the Negroes there, and
how eafy it was to purchafe upon the Coaft, for
Trifles, fuch as Beads, Toys, Knives, Sciflars,
Hatchets, bits of Glafs, and the like ; not only
Gold D.ift, Guinea Grains, Elephants Teeth, &c.
but Negroes for the-Service of the Biajils, in great
Numbers.
They liftened always very attentively to my
Difcourfes on thefe Heads, but efpecially to that
Part which related to the buying Negroet, which
was a Trade at that time not only not far entred
into, but as far as it was, had been carried on by
the Affiento's, or Permiflion of the Kings of Spain
and Portugal, and engrofs'd in the Publick, fo that
tew Negroes were brought, .and thofe excelfive
dear.
It happen'd, being in Company with fome Mer-
chants and Planters of my Acquaintance, and
talking of thofe things very earneftly, three of
them came to me the next Morning, and told me
they had been mufing very much upon what I had
difcourfed with them of, the laft Night, and they
came to make a fecret Propofal to me; and after
enjoining me Secrecy, they told me, that they had
a mind to fie o•.it a Ship to go to Guinea., that
they had all Plantations as well as I, and were
flraiten'd for nothing fo much as Servants ; that as
it was a Trade that could not be carried on, be-;
caufe they could not publickly fell the Negroes
when they came home, fo they defired to
make but one Voyage, to bring the Negroes. on
Shore privately, and divide them among their
own, Plantations; and in a Word, the Queftion
was, whether I would go their Super-Cargo in the
Ship to manage the Trading Part upon the Coaft
ot
 of Guinea ? And they offer'd me that I fhould have
my equal Share of the Negroes, without providing
any Part of the Stock.
This was a fair Propofal, it rnuft be confefs'd,
had it been made to any one that" had not had a
Settlement and Plantation of his own to look after,
which was in a fair way of coming to^be very
confiderable, and with a good Stock upon it. But
for me that was thus entered and eftablifhed, and
had nothing to do but go on as I had begun for
three or four Years more, and to have fent for the
other hundred Pound from England, and who in
that time, and with that little Addition, could
fcarce ha' fail'd of being worth three or four thou-
fand Pounds Sterling, and that encreafing too; for
me to think of fuch a Voyage, was the moft pre-
pofterous Thing that ever Man in fuch Circumftan.-
ces could be guilty of.
But I that was born to be my own Deftroyer,
could no more refill the Offer than Ii could re-
ftrain my rirft rambling Defigns, when my Fa-
ther's good Counfel was loft upon me. In a word,
I told them I would go with all my Heart, if
they would undertake to look after my Plantation
in my Abfence, and would difpofe of it to fuch
as I mould direct if I mifcarry'd. This they all
engag'd to do, and entred into Writings or Cove-
nants to do fo; and I made a formal Will, difpo-
fing of my Plantation and Effects, in Cafe of my
Death, making the Captain of the Ship that had
fav'd my Life as before, my univerfal Heir, but
obliging him to difpofe of my Effects as I had di-
rlfcted in my Will, one half of the Produce being
to himfelf, and the other to be fhipp'd to England.
In {hort, I took all poffible Caution to preferve
my Eftects; and keep up my Plantation ; had I u-
fed half as much Prudence to have look'd into my
own
]
own Intereft, and have made a Judgment of what
1 ought to have done, and not to have done, I had
certainly never gone away from fo profperous an
Undertaking, leaving all the probable Views of a
thriving Circumftance, and gone upon a Voyage to
Sea, artenctd with ail its common Hazards; to fay
nothing of. the Reafons I had to expect particular
Misfortflnes to my felf.
But ,1 was hurry'd on, and obey'd blindly the
Dictates of my Fancy rather than my Reafon : and
accordingly the Ship being fitted out, and the Car-
go furnifhed, and all things done as by Agreement,
by my Partners in the Voyage, I went on Board
in an evil Hour, the th of , being
the fame Day eight Year that I went from my
Father and Mother at Hull, in order to act the
Rebel to their Authority, and the Fool to my own
Intereft.
Our Ship was about 120 Tun Burthen, carried
6 Guns, and 14 Men, befides the Mafter, his Boy,
and my felf; yve had on Board no large Cargo of
Goods , except of fuch Toys as were fit for our
Trade with the Negroes, fuch as Beads, bits of
Glafs, Shells, and odd Trifles, efpecially little
Looking-Glafles, Knives, Sciifars, Hatchets, and
the like.
The fame, Day I went on Board we fet fail,
{landing. away to the Northward upon our own
Coaft, with Delign to ftretch over for the AffruM
Coafi, whew they came about 10 or 12 Degrees of
Northern Latitude, which it feems was the man-
ner of their Courfe in thofe Days. We had very
good Weather, only exceflive hot, all the way up-
on our own Coaft, till we came the Height of
Cafe St. Auguftino, from whence keeping farther off
at Sea \vc lolt Sight of Land, and fteer'd as if we
was bound for the Ifle Few at. d de ftcronka, holding
our
our Courfe N. E. by N, and leaving thofc Hies on
the Eaft ; in this Courfe we paft the Line in about
12 Days time, and were by our laft Obfervation in
7 Degrees iiMin. Northern Latitude, when a vi-
olent Tournado or Hurricane took us quite out of
our Knowledge; it began from the South-Eaft,
came about to the North-Weft, and then fettled
into the North-Eaft, from whence it blew in fnch
a terrible manner, that for 12 Days together we
could do nothing but drive, and fcudding away
before it, let it carry us whither ever Fate and the
Fury of the Winds directed ; and during thefe 12
Days, I need not fay, that I expected every Day
to be fwallowed up, nor indeed did any in the
Ship expect to fave their Lives.
In this Diftrefs, we had, befides the Terror of
the Storm, one of our Men died of the Calenture,
and one Man and the Boy wauYd over-board ; a-
bout the 12th Day the Weather abating a little,
the Mafter made an Obfervation as well as he
could, and found that he was in about n Degrees
North Latitude, but that he was 22 Degrees of
Longitude difference Weft from Cafe St. Auguftinti ;
fo that he found he was gotten upon the Coaft
of Guiney, or the North Part of Brafil, beyond
the River Amcz,ones, toward that of the River Oro-
noque, commonly call'd the Great River, and began
to confuit with me what Courfe he fhould take,
for the Ship was leaky and very much difabled,
and he was going directly back to tHe Coaft of
Brajtt.
I was pofitively againft that, and looking over
the Charts of the Sea-Coaft of America with him,
we concluded there was no inhabited Country for
us to have recourfe to, till we came within the Cir-
cle of the Carribbe-I/lands, and therefore reiolved
to ftand away for Barbadoes, which by keeping off
at
• [
at Sea* to avoid the Indraft of the Bay or Gulph
of Mexico, we might eafily perform, as we hoped,
in about fifteen Days Sail, whereas we could not
poflibly make our Voyage to the Coaft of Africa
without fome Afliitance, both to our Ship and to
our felves.
With this Defign we chang'd our Courfe, and
fleer'd away N. W. by W. in order to reach
fome of our Englijh Iflands, where I hoped for Re-
lief; but our Voyage* was otherwife determined,
for being in the Latitude of 12 Deg. 18 Min. a
fecond Storm came upon us, which carry'd us a-
way with the fame Impetuofity Weftward, and
drove us fo out of the very Way of all humane
Commerce, that had all our Lives been laved, as
to the Sea, we were rather in Danger of being de-
voured by Savages than ever returning to our own
Country.
In this Diftrefs, the Wind ftill blowing very
hard, one of our Men early in the Morning,
cry'd out, Land; and we had no fooner run out
of the Cabbin to look out in hopes of feeing
whereabouts in the World we were ; but the Ship
ftruck upon a Sand, and in a Moment her Motion
being fo ftopp'd, the Sea broke over her in fuch a
manner, that we expected we fhould all have pe-
rifh'd immediately, and we were immediately dri-
ven into our -clofe Quarters to fhelter us from the
very Foam and Sprye of the Sea.
It is ndt eafy for any one, who has not been
in the like Condition, to defcribe or conceive the
Confternation of Men in fuch Circumftances; we
knew nothing where we were, or upon what Land
it was we were driven, whether an Ifland or the
Main, whether inhabited or not inhabited; ^and
as the Rage of the Wind was ftill great, tho ra-
ther lefs than at firft, we could not fo much as
hope
. [49]
hope to have the Ship hold many Minutes with-
out breaking in Pieces, unlefs the Winds by a kind
of Miracle fhould turn immediately about. In a
word, we fat looking one upon another, and ex-
pecting Death every Moment, and every .Man adt-
ing accordingly, as preparing for another World,
for there was little or nothing more for us to do in
this i that which was our prefent Comfort, and all
the Comfort we had, was, that contrary to our
-Expectation the Ship did not break yet, and that
f.he Mafter faid the Wind began to abate.
Now tho' we thought that the Wind did a little
abate, yet the Ship having thus ftruck upon the
Sand, and flicking too faft for us to expect her" get-
ting off, we were in a dreadful Condition indeed,
and had nothing to do but to think of faving our
Lives as well as we could ; we had a Boat at our
Stern, /uft before the Storm, but fhe was firft ftav'd
by dafhing againft the Ship's Rudder, and in the
next Place fhe broke away, and either funk or
was driven off to Sea, fo there was no hope from
her; we had another Boat on Board, but how to
get her off into the Sea, 'was a doubtful thing;
however, there was no room to debate, for we
fancy'd the Ship would breajc in Pieces every Mi-
nute, and fome told usJlie was actually broken al-
ready.
In this Diftrefs, the Mate of our VeflTel lays hold
of the Boat, and with the help of the reft of the
Men, they got her flung over the Ship's-fide, and
getting all into her, let go, and committed our
felves being Eleven in Number, to God's Mercy,
and the wild Sea; for tho' the Storm was abated
confiderably, yet the Sea went dreadful high upon-
the Shore, and might well be call'd, Den -wild Zee,
as the Dutchrcn\[ the Sea in a Storm.
E Aad
And now our Cafe was very difmal indeed ; for
we ail faw plainly, that the Sea went fo high, that
the Boat could not live, and that we fhould be ine-
vipbiy drowned. As to making Sail, we had none,
nor, it we had, could we have done any thing with
it ;t fo we work'd at the Oar towards the Land,
tno with heavy Hearts, like Men going to Executi-
on; for we all knew, that when the Boat came near-
er the Shore, fhe would be dafh'd in a thoufand
Pieces by the Breach of the Sea. However, we
committed our Souls to God in the moft earncft
Mamie*, and the Wind driving us towards the Shore,
we haften'd our Deftrucftion with our own Hands,
pulling as well as we could towards Land.
What the Shore was, whether Rock or Sand,
whether Steep or Shoal, we knew not; the only
Hope that could rationally give us the leaft Shadow
of Expectation, was, if we might happen into fome
Bay or Gulph, or the Mouth of fome River, where
by great Chance we might have run our Boat in, or
got under the Lee of the Land, and perhaps made
fmooth Water. But there was nothing of this ap-
peared; but as we made nearer and nearer the
Shore, the Land look'd more frightful than the Sea.
Arter we had row'd, or rather driven about a
League and a Half, as we reckon'd it, a raging
Wave, Mountain-like, came rowiing a-ftern of us,
and plainly bad us expect the Couf-de-Grace. In a
word, it took us with fuch a Fury, that it overfet
the. Boat: at once ; and feparating us as well from
the Boat, as from one another, gave us not time
hardly to fay, O God! for we were all fwallowed
up in a Moment.
, Nothing can defcribe the Confufion of Thought
which I felt when I funk into the Water; for tho' I
iwam very well, yet I could not deliver my felf from.
the Waves fo as to draw Breath, till that Wave
havmg
 having driven me, or rather carried me a vaft Way
on towards the Shore, and having fpent it felf, went
back, and left me upon the Land almoft dry, but
half dead with the Water I took in, I had fo much
Prefence of Mind as well as Breath left, that feeing
my felf nearer the main Land than I expeded, I got
upon my Feet, and endeavoured to make on to-
wards the Land as faft as I could, before another
Wave fhould return, and take me up again. But I
foon found it was impoflible to avoid it; for I faw
the Sea come after me as high as a great Hill, and
as furious as an Enemy which I had no Means or
Strength to contend with r my Bufinefs was to hold
my Breath, and rife my felf upon the Water, if I
could : and fo by fwimming to preferve. my Breath-
ing, and Pilot my felf towards the Shore, if poffi-
ble ; my greateft Concern now being, that the Sea,
as it would carry me a great Way towards the Shore
when it came on, might not carry me back again
* with it when it gave back towards the Ssa.
The Wave that came upon me again, buried me
at once 20 or 30 Foot deep in its own Body ; and I
could feel my felf carried with a mighty Force and
Swiftnefs towards the Shore a very great Way; but
I held my Breath, and affifted my felf to fvvim flill
forward with all my Might. I was ready to burft
with holding my Breath, when, as I felt my fel£
rifing up, fo to my "immediate Relief, I found my
Head and Hands Ihoot out above the Surface of the
Water; and tho' it was not two Seconds of Time
that I could keep my felf fo, yet it reliev'd me
greatly, gave me Breath and new Courage. I was
covered again with Water a good while, but not
fo long but I held it out; and finding the Water
had fpent it felf, and began to return, I ftrook for-
ward againft rhe Return of the Waves, and felt
Ground again with my Feet. I flood ftill a few
E a Mo-
Moments to recover Breath, and till the Water
went from me, and then took to my Heels, and run
with what Strength I had farther towards the Shore.
But neither would this deliver me from the Fury of
the Sea, which came pouring in after me a,gain,.
and twice more I was lifted up by the Waves and
carried forwards as before,the Shore being very flat.
The laft Time of thefe two had well near been
fatal to me j for the Sea having hurried me along as
before, landed me, or rather dalh'd me again A a
Piece of a Rock, and that with fuch Force, as it
left me fenfelefs, and indeed helplefs, as to my own
Deliverance; for the Blow taking my Side and
Breaft, beat the Breath as it were quite out of my
Body ; and had it returned again immediately, f
mml have been ftrangled in the Water ; but 1 re-
cover'd a little before the return of the Waves,
and feeing I fhould be cover 'd again with the
Water, I refolv'd to hold fatt by a Piece of the
Rock, and fo to hold my Breath, if poffible, till
the Wave went back ; now as the Waves were not
fo high as at firft, being near Land, I held my
Hold till the Wave abated, and then fetch'd ano-
ther Run, which brought me fo near the Shore,
that the next Wave, tho' it went over me, yet did
not fo fwallow me up as to carry me away, and
the next run I took, I got to the main Land,
where, to my great Comfort, I clamber'd up the
Gifts of the Shore, and fat me down upon the
Grafs, free from Danger, and quite out of the.
Reach of the Water.
I,was now landed, and fafe on Shore, and began
to look up and thauk God that my Life was fav'd in
a Cafe wherein there was feme Minutes before fcarcc
any room to hope. I believe it is impoflible to ex-
prcfs to the Lire what the Extafies and Tranfports of
. the -
the Soul are, when it is fo fav'd, as I may fay, out
of the very Grave; and I do not wonder now at
that Cuttom, viz,':. That when a Malefador, who
has the Halter about his Neck, istyedup, andjuft
going to be turn'd off, and has a Reprieve brought
to him .. I fay, I do not wonder that they bring a
Surgeon with it, to let him Blood that very Mo-
ment they tell him of it, that the Surprize may not
drive the Animal Spirits from the Heart, and over-
whelm him:
\
Furfudden Joys, like Griefs, confound at fir ft.
I walk'd about on the Shore, liftingupmy Hands,
and my whole Being, as I may fay, wrapt up in the
Contemplation of my Deliverance, making a thou-
fand Gefturesand Motions which I cannot defcribe,
reflecting upon all my Comerades that were drown'd,
and that there mould not be one Soul fav'd but my
felf; for, as for them, I never faw them afterwards,
or any Sign of them, except three of their Hats
one Cap, and two Shoes that were not Fellows.
I caftmy Eyes to the ftranded Veflel, when the
Breach and Froth of.the Sea being fo big, I could
hardly fee it, it lay fo far off, and confidered, Lord 1
how was if poffible I could get on Shore /
After I had folac'd my Mind with the comforable
Part of my Condition, I began to look round me to
fee what kind of Place I was in, and what was next
to be done, and I foon found my Comforts abate,
and that in a Word I had a dreadful Deliverance :
For I was wet, had no Cloaths to fhift me, nor any
thing either to eat or drink to comfort me, neither
did I fee any Profpect before me, but that of pe-
rifhing with Hunger, or being devour'd by wild
Brafts; and that which was particularly afflicting
to me, was, that I had no Weapon either to hunt
E 3 and
and kill any Creature for my Suftenance, or to de-
tend my felf againft any other Creature that might
defire to kill me for theirs : In a Word, I had no-
thing about me but a Knife, a Tobacco-pipe, and
a little Tobacco in a Box; this was all my Provili-
on, and this threw me into terrible Agonies of
Mind, that for a while I run about like a Mad-man;
Night coming updfi me, I began with a heavy
Heart to confider what would be my Lot if there
were any ravenous Beafls in that Country, feeing at
Night they always come abroad for their Prey.
All the Remedy that offer'd to my Thoughts at
that Time, was, to get up into a thick bufhy Tree
like a Firr, but thorny, which grew near me, and
where I refolv'd to fit all Night, and confider the
••next Day what Death I fhould dye, for as yet I
faw no Profpect of Life; I walk'd about a Furlong
from the Shore, to fee if I could find any frefh Wa-
ter to drink, which I did, to my great Joy; and ha-
ving drank, and put a little Tobacco in my Mouth
to prevent Hunger, I went to the Tree, and get-
ting up into it, endeavour'd to place my felf fo, as
that if I fhould deep I might not fall; and having
cut me a fhort Stick, like a Truncheon, for my
Defence, I took up my Lodging, and having been
exceffively fatigu'd, I fell fafl afleep, and flept as
comfortably as, I believe, few could have done
in my Condition, and found my felf the moft re-
frefh'd with it, that I think I ever was on fuch an
Occafion.
When I wak'd it was broad Day, the Weather
clear, and the Storm abated, fo that the Sea did
not rage and fwell as before : But that which fur-
priz'd me moft, was, that the Ship was lifted off
in the Night from the Sand where {lie lay, by
the Spelling of the Tyde, and was driven up al-
moft as far as the Rock which I firfl mention 'd,
where
where I had been fo bruis'd by the darning me a-
fainftit; this being within about a Mile from the
hore where I was, and the Ship feeming to fiand
upright ftill, I wifh'd my felf on board, that, at
leaft, I might fave fo'me neceffary things for my
ufe.
When I came down from my Appartment in the
Tree, I look'd about me again, and the firfl thing I
found was the Boat, which lay as the Wind and
the Sea had tofs'd her up upon the Land, about
two Miles on my right Hand, I walk'd as far as I
could upon the Shore to have got to her, but found
a Neck or Inlet of Water between me and the
Boat, which was about half a Mile broad, fo I
came back for the prefent, being more intent upon
getting at the Ship, where I hop'd to find fome-
thing for my prefent Subfiftence,
A little after Noon I found the Sea very calm,
and the Tide ebb'd fo far out, that I could come
within a Quarter of a Mile of the Ship; and here
I found a frefh renewing of my Grief, for I faw
evidently, that if we had kept on Board, we had
been all fafe, that is to fay, we had all got fafe
on Shore, and I had not been fo miferable as to
be left entirely deftitute of all Comfort and Com-
pany, as I now was; this forced Tears from my
Eyes again, but as there was litle Relief in that,
I refolv'd, if poffible, to get to the Ship, fo I
pull'd off my Cloaths, [for the Weather was hot to
Extremity, and took the Water; but when I came
to the Ship, my Difficulty was ftill greater to
know how to get on Board, for as fhe lay a-ground,
and high out of the Water, there was nothing
within my Reach to lay hold of, I fwam round
her twice, and the fecond Time I fpy'd a fmall
Piece of a Rope, which I wonder'd I did not fee
at firft, hang down by the Fore-Chains fo low,
£4 as
as that with great Difficulty i got hold of it, and
by the help of that Rope, got up into the Fore-
caftle of the Ship, here I found that the Ship was
bulg'd, and had a great deal of Water in her Hold,
but that fhe lay fo on the Side of a Bank of hard
Sand, or rather Earth, and her Stern lay lifted up
upon the Bank, and her Head low ahnoft to
the Water; by this Means all her Quarter was
free, and all that was in that Part was dry;
for you may be fure my firft Work was to fearch
and to fee what was fpoird and what was
free; and firft I found that all the Ship's Pro-
vifions were dry and untouch'd by the Water,
and being very well dilpos'd to eat, I went to
the Bread-room and fill'd my Pockets with Bif-
ket, and eat it as I went about other things,
for I had no time to lofe ? I alfo found fome Rum
in the great Cabbin, of which I took a large
Dram, and which I had indeed need enough of
to fpirit me for what was before me: Now I
wanted nothing but a Boat to furnifh my felf with
many things which I forefaw would be very necefla-
ry to me.
It was in vain to fit ftill and wifh for what was
not to be had, and this Extremity rouz'd my
Application j we had feveral fpare Yards, and
two or three large fparrs of Wood, and a fpare
Top-maft or two in the Ship j I .refolv'd to faiJ to
work with thefe, and flung as many of them
over board as I could manage of their Weight,
tying every one with a Rope that they might
not drive away ; when this was done I went down
the Ship's Side, and pulling- them to me, I ty'd
four of them foft together at both Ends as well
as I could, in the Form of a Raft, and laying
two or three fhort Pieces of Plank upon them
Crofs'ways, I found I could walk upon it very
• well,
well, but that it was not able to bear any great
Weight, the Pieces being too light; fo 1 went to
work, and with the Carpentet's •. Saw I cut a fpare
Top-maft into three Lengths, and added them to
my Ratt, with a great deal of Labour and Pains,
but hope of furnilhing my felf with Neceflaries, en-
courag'd me to go beyond what 1 fhould have been
able to have done upon another Occaiion.
My Raft was now ftrong enough to bear any
reafbnable Weight ; my next Care was what co
load it with, and how to preferve what I laid upon
it from the Surf of the Sea; but I was not»long confi-
dering this I firft laid all the Planks or Boards upon
it that I could get, and having confider'd well what
I moft wanted, I finl got three of the Seamens
Chefts, which I had broken open and empty'd, and
lower'd them down upon my Raft; the firft of
thefe I fiil'd with Provifions, viz.. Bread, Rice,
three Dutch Checfcs, five Pieces of dry'd Goat's
Flefh, which we liv'd much upon, and a little Re-
mainder of EurofeanCom which had been laid by
for fome Fowls which we brought "to Sea with us,
but the Fowls were kill'd; there had been fome Ear-
ly and Wheat together, but,£to my great Difap-
pointment, I found afterwards that the Rats had
eaten or fpoil'd'itall j as for Liquors, I found feve-
veral Cafes of Bottles belonging to our Skipper, in
which were fome Cordial Waters, and in all about
. 'five or fix Gallons of Rack, thefe I ftow'd by
themfelve?, there being no need to put them into
the Cheft, nor no room for them. While I was
doing this, I found the Tide began to flow, tho'
very calm, and 1 had the Mortification to fee my
Coat, Shirt, and Waft-coat, .which I had left on
Shore upon the Sand, fwim away j as for my
Breeches which were only Linnen and open-knee'd,
I fwam on board in them and my Stockings : How-
ever
ever this put me upon rummaging for Cloaths, of
which I found enough, but took no more than 1
wanted for prefent ufe, for 1 had other thing.?
which my Eye was more upon, as firft Tools to
work witli on Shore, and it was after long fearch-
ing that I found out the Carpenter's Chett, which
was indeed a very ufeful Prize to me, and much
more valuable than a Ship Loading of Gold would
have been at that time; I got it down to my Raft,
even whole as it was, without loofing time to look
into it, for I knew in general what it contain'd.
My next Care was for fome Ammunition and
Arms; there were two very good Fowling-pieces
in the great Cabbin, and two Piftols, thefe I fe-
cur'd firft, with fome Powder-horns, and a fmall
Bag of Shot, and two old rufty Swords: I knew
there were three Barrels of Powder in the Ship,
but knew not where our Gunner had ftow'd them,
but with much fearch I found them, two of them
dry and good, the third had taken Water, thofe
two I got to my Raft, with the Arms, and now
I thought my felf pretty well freighted, and be-
gan to think how I fhould get to Shore wittathem,
having neither Sail, Oar, or Rudder, and the leaft
Cap full of AVind would have overfet all my Na-
vigation.
I had three Encouragements, i. A fmooth
calm Sea, 2. The Tide rifing" and fetting in to
?he Shore, 3. What little Wind there was blew
me towards the Land; and thus, having found two
or three broken Oars belonging to the Boat, and
befides the Tools which were in the Cheft, I found
two Saws, an Axe, and a Hammer, and with this
Cargo I put to Sea: For a Mile, or thereabouts my
Raft went very well, only that I found it drive a
little diftant from the Place where I had landed be-
fore, by which I perceiv'd that there was fome In-
- draft:
draft of the Water, and confequently I hop'd to
rljid fome Creek or River there, which I might
make ufe of as a'Port to get to Land with my
Cargo.
As I imagin'd, fo it was, there appear'd before
me a little opening of the Land, and I found a
ftrong Current of the Tide fet into it, fo I gui-
ded my Raft as well as I could to keep in the Mid-
dle of the Stream : But here I had like to have
fufrer'd a fecond Shipwreck, which, if I had, I
think verily would have broke my Heart, for know-
ing nothing of the Coaft, my Raft run a-ground
at one end of it upon a Shoal, and not being a-
ground at the other End, it wanted but a little
that all my Cargo had flipp'd off towards tha.t End
that was a-float, and fo fall'n into the Water: I
did my utmoft by fetting my Back againft the
Chefls, to keep them in their Places, but could
not thruft off the Raft with all my Strength, nei-
ther durlt. I ftir from the Pofture I was in, but hold-
ing up the Chefts with all my Might, flood in that
Manner near half an Hour, in which time the rifing
of the Water brought me a little more upon a Le-
vel , and a little after, the Water ftill rifing, my
.Raft floated again, and I thruft her off with the
Oar I had, into the Channel, and then driving up
higher, I at length found my felf in the Mouth of a
little River, with Land on both Sides, and a
ftrong Current or Tide running up, I look'd on both
Sides for a proper Place to get to Shore, for I was
not willing to be driven too high up the River,
hoping in time to fee fome Ship at Sea, and there-
fore refolv'd to place my felf as near the Coait as
I could.
At length I fpy'd a little Cove on the right
Shore, of the Creek, to which with great Pain and
Difficulty I guided my Raft, and at laft got fo near,
as
[rfo]
as that, reaching Ground with my Oar, I coul
thruft her diredly in, but here I had like to havr
dipt all my Cargo in the Sea again; for that Shoe
lying pretty fteep, that is to fay Hoping, the'n
was no Place to land, but where one End of re.
Float, if it run on Shore, would lie fo high, ad"
the other fink lower as before, that it would en-
danger my Cargo again : All that I could do, was
to wait 'till the Tide was at the higheft, keeping the
Raft with my Oar like an Anchor to hold the Side
of it faft to the 'Shore, near 'a flat Piece of
Ground, which I expected the Water would flow
over; and fo it did.. As foon as I found Water
enough, for my Raft drew about a Foot of Water, I
thruft. her on upon that flat Piece of Ground, and
there faften'd or mor'd her by flicking my two
broken Oars into) the Ground; one on one Side
near one End, and one on the other Side near the
other End; and thus I lay till the Water ebb'd a-
way, and left• my Raft and all my Cargo fafe on
Shore.
My next Work was to view the Country, and
feek a proper Place for my Habitation, and where
to flow my Goods to fecure them from whatever
might happen ; where I was, I yet knetfc not, whe-
ther on the Continent or on an Illand,\ whether in-
habited, or not inhabited, whether in Danger of
wi:d B-afts or not: There was a Hill not above
a Mile from me, which rofe up very fteep and high,
arid which fecm'd to over-top fome other Hills
which lay as in a Ridge from it Northward; I took
out one of the Fowling Pieces, and one of the^Pi-
ftols, and an Horn of Powder, and thus arm'd I
travcll'd for Difcovery up to the Top of that Hill,
where after I had wicn great Labour and Difficul-
'tv ROi: to the Top, I faw my Fate to my great
Affliction, (viz,.) that I was in an Ifland environ'd
every
every Way with the Sea, no Land to be feen, ex-
cept fome Rocks which lay a great Way off, and
two fmall Iflands lefs than this, which lay about
three Leagues to the, Weft.
I found alfo that the Ifland I was in was barren,
and, as I faw good Reafon to believe, un-inhabited,
except by wild Beafts, of whom however I faw
none, yet I faw abundance of Fowls, but knew
not their Kinds, neither when I kill'd them could
I tell what was fit for Food, and what not; at my
coming back, I fhot at a great Bird which I faw
fitting upon a Tree on the Side of a great Wood, I
believe it was the firft Gun that had been fir'd
there fince the Creation of the World ; I had no
fooner fir'd, but from all the Parts of the Wood
there arofe an innumerable Number of Fowls of
many Sorts, making a confus'd Screaming, and
crying every one according to his ufual Note; but
not one of them of any Kind that I knew : As for
the Creature I kill'd, I took it to be a Kind of a
Hawk, its Colour and Beak refembling it, but had
no Talons or Claws more than common, its Flefli
wasCarrion, and fit for nothing.
Contented with this Difcovery, I came back to
my Raft, and fell to Work to bring my Cargo on
Shore, which took me up'the -reft of that Day, and
what to do with my fe!f at Night I knew not, nor
indeed where tp reft; for I was afraid to lie down
on the Ground, not knowing but feme wild Beaft
might devour me, tho', as I after wards found, there
was really nc^Need for thofe Fears.
However, as well as I could, I barricadoM my
felf round with the Chefts and Boards that I had
brought on Shore, and made a kind of a Hut for
that Night's Lodging; as for Food, I yet faw not
which" Way to Ripply my felf, except that I had
feen
feen two or three Creatures like Hares run out of
the Wood where I fhot the Fowl.
I now began to confider, that I might yet get
a great many Things out of the Ship, which would
be ufeful to me, and particularly Tome of the Rig-
ging, and Sails, and fuch other Things as might
come to Land, and I refolv'd to make another Voy-
age on Board the Veffel, if poffible; and as I
knew that the firft Storm that blew muft neceflarily
break her all in Pieces, I refolved to fet all other
Things apart, 'till I got every Thing out of the
Ship that I could get; then Icali'd a Council, that
is to fay, in my Thoughts, whether I fhould take
back the Raft, but this appear'd impracticable; fo
I refoiv'd to go as before, when the Tide was
down, and I did fo, only that I /tripp'd before I
went from my Hutt, having nothing on but a che-
quer'd Shirt, and a Pair of Linnen Drawers, and a
Pair of Pumps on my Feet.
I got on Board the Ship, as before, and prepar'd
a fecond Raft, and having had Experience of the
firft, I neither made this fo unweildy, nor loaded
it fo hard, but yet I brought away feveral Things
very ufeful to me; as firft, in the Carpenter's Stores
I found two or three Bags full of Nails and Spiker,
a great Skreivjack, a Dozen or two of Hatchets,
and above all, that moil ufeful Thing call'd a.
Grind-ftone; all thefe I fecur'd together, with fe-
veral Things belonging to the Gunner, particular-
ly two or three Iron Crows, and two Barrels of
Mufquet-Bullets, feven Mufqucts, and another
Fowl ing-Piece, with fome fmall Quantity of Pow-
der more; a large Bag full of fmall Shot, and a
great Roll of Sheet Lead : But this laft was fo heavy,
I could not hoife it up to get itdver the Ship's Sfde.
Befides thefe Things, I took &11 the Mens Cloaths
that I could find, and a fjur; For^-top-fail, Ham-
mock,
mock and fome Bedding; and with this I loaded my
fecond Raft, and brought them all fafe on Shore to
my very great Comfort.
I was under feme Apprehenfioris during my Ab-
fence from the Land, that at leaft my Provisions
might be devour'don Shore; but when I came back,
I found no Sign of any Vifitor, only there fat a
Creature like a wild Cat upon one .of the Chefts,
which when I came towards it, ran away a little
Diftance, and then flood ftill; fhe fat very com-
pos'd, and unconcern'd, and look'd full in my Face,
as if fhe had a Mind to be acquainted with me, I
prefented my Gun at her, but as fhe did not under-
ftand it, fee was perfectly unconcern'd at it, nor.
did fhe ofter to ftir away; upon which I tofs'd her
a bit, of Bisket, tho' by the Way I was not very
free of it, for my Store was not great: However,
I fpar'd her a bit, I fay, and fhe went to it, fmell'd
of it, and ate it, and look'd (as pleas'd) for more,
but I thank'd her, and could fpare no more; fo fhe
march'd off. ;
Having got my fecond Cargo on Shore, tho' I
was fain to open the Barrels of Powder, and. bring
them by Parcels, for they were too heavy, being
large Casks, I went to work to make me a little
Tent with the Sail and feme Poles which I cut for
that Purpofe, and into this Tent I brought every
Thing that I knew would fpoil, either with Rain
or Sun, and I piled all the empty Chefts and Casks
up in a Circle round the Tent, to fortify it from a-
ny fudden Attempt, either from Man or Beaft.
When I had done this I block'd up the Door of
the Tent with fome Boards within, and an empty
Cheft fee up an End xvithout, and fpreadiug one
of the Beds upon the Ground, laying my two Pi-
ftols juft acmy Head, and my Gun at Length by
me, I went to Bed for the firft Time, and flept
very.
very quietly all Night, for I was very weary and
hetvy, for the Night before I had fltpt little, and
had Labour'd very hard all Day, as well to fetch all
thofe Things from the Ship, as to get them on
Shore.
I had the biggelr. Magazine of all Kinds now
that ever were laid up, I believe, for one Man ;
but I wa» not fatisfy'd {till ; for while the Ship fat
upright in that Pofture, I tho igbt I ought to gee
every Thing out of her that I could; fo every Day
at low Water I w-nc on BoarJ, and brought away
fome Thing or other: But »particu!arly the third
Time I went, I brought away as much of the Rig-
ging as I could, as alfo all the fmail Ropes and
Royc-twine I could get, with a Piece of ipare Can-
vafs, which was to mend the Sails upon Occa/ion,
the Barrel of wet Gun-powder.. In a VVordJ brought
away all the Sails firft and lalt, only that I was
fain to cut them in Pieces, and bring as much at a
Time as I could ; for they were no more ufeful to
be Sails, but as meerCanvafs only.
But that which comforted me more ftill, was,
that at laft of all, after I had made five or fix fucfl
Voyages as thefe, and thought I had nothing more
to expect from the Ship that was worth my m'ed-
ling with, I fay, after all this, I found a great Hog-
fhead of Bread, and three large'Runlets of Run or
Spirits, and a Box of Sugar, and a Barrel of fine
Flower ', this was furprizing to me, becaufe I had
given over expecting any more Provifions, except
what was fyoii'd by the Water : Ifoon empty'd the
Hogfhead of that Bread, and wrapt it up, Parcel
by Parcel, in Pieces of the Sails, which I cutout:
and in a Word, I got all this fafe on Shore alfo.
The next Day I made anorher Voyage; and
now having plunder'd the Ship of what was porta-
ble
ble and fit to hand out, I began with the Cables;
and cutting the great Cable into Pieces, fuch as I
could move, I got two Cables arid a Hawfer oil
Shore, with all the Iron-work I could get, and
having cut down the Spritfail-yard, and the Mi-
fen-yard, and every Thing I could to make a large
Raft, I loaded it with all thofe heavy Goods, and
came away: But my good Luck began now td
leave me; for this Raft was fo unweildy, and fo
overladen, that after I was enter'd the little Cave,
where I had landed the reft of my Goods, not
being able to guide it fo handily as I did the o-
ther, it overfet, and threw me and all my Cargo
into the Water; as for my felf it was no great Harm,
for I was near the Shore; but as to my Cargo, it
Was great part of it loft, efpecially the Iron, which
I expected would have been of great Ufe to me t
However, when the Tide was out, I got moft of
the Pieces of Cable afhore, and fome of the Iron,
tho' with infinite Labour; for I was fain to dip foe
it into the Water, a Work which fatigu'd me very
much ; after this, I went every Day on Boardj
and brought away what I could get.
I had been now 13 Days on Shore, and had been
I1 Times on Board the Ship; in which Time I
had brought away all that one Pair of Hands could
Well be fuppos'd capable to bring, tho' I believe
verily, had the calm Weather held, I mould have
brought away the whole Ship, Piece by Piece :
But prtjparing the 12thTime to go on Board,!found
the Wind begin to rife; however at low Water I
went on Board, and tho' I thought I had ru-
mag'd the Cabbin fo effectually, as that nothing
more could be, founds yet I difcover'd a Locker
with Drawers in it, in one of which I found two
or three Razors, and One Pair of large Sciflars,
with fome ten or a dozen of good Knives and
F * Forks j
Forks; in another I found about Thirty fix Pounds
value;in Money, Tome European Coin, fome Bra/il,
feme Pieces of Eight, fome Gold, fome Silver.
I fmil'd to my ielf at the Sight of this Money.
0 Drug! faid I aloud, what art thou good for?
Thou art not worth to me, no not the taking oft
of the Ground, one of thofe Knives is worth all
this Heap, I have no Manner of ufe for thee, e'en
remain where thou art, and go to the Bottom as
a Creature whofe Life is not worth faving. How-
ever upon fecond Thoughts, I took it away, and
wrapping all this in a Piece of Canvas, I began
to think of making another Raft, but while I was
preparing this, I found the Sky over-caft, and the
Wind began to rife, and in a Quarter of an Hour
it blew a frefh Gale from the Shore; it prefently
occur'd to me, that it was in vain to pretend to
make a Raft with the Wind oft" Shore, and that
it was my Bufinefs to be gone before the Tide of
Flood began, otherwife I might not be able to
reach the Shore at all: Accordingly I let myfelf
down into the Water, and fwam crofs the Channel,
which lay between the Ship and the Sands, and
even that with Difficulty enough, partly with the
Weight of the Things I had about me, and partly
the Roughnefs of the Water, for the Wind rofe
very haftily, and before it was quite high Water
it blew a Storm.
But I was gotten home to my little Tent, where
1 lay with all my Wealth about me very fefure. It
blew very hard all that Night, and in the Morning
when I look'd out, behold no more Ship was to be
feen, 1 was a little furpriz'd, but recover'd my
fe!f with this fatisfaclory Reflection, viz. That I
had loft no time, nor abated no Diligence to get
every thing out of her that could be ufeful to me,
and that indeed there was little left in her that I
was
 [671
$ras able to bring away, if I had had mbre time;
I now gave over any more Thoughts of the
Ship, or of any thing out of her, except what
might drive on Shore from her Wreck, as indeed
divers Pieces of her afterwards did; but thofe
things were of fmall ufe tome.
My Thoughts were now wholly employ5d about
fecuring my felf againfi either Savages, if any
fhould appear, dr wild Beafls, if any were in the
Ifland ; and I had many Thoughts of the Method
how to do this* and what kind of Dwelling to
make, whether I fhould make me a Cave in the
Earth, or a Tent upon the Earth : And, in fhort,
I refolv'd upon both, the Manner and Defcripti-
on oi which it may not be improper to give an
Account of.
I foon found the Place I was in was not for my
Settlement, particularly becaufe it was upon a low
mooriili Ground near the Sea, and I believ'd would
not be wholfome, and more particularly becaufe
there was no frefh Water near it, fo I refolv'd to
find a more healthy and more convenient Spot of
Ground.
I confulted feveral Things in my Situation which
I found would be proper for me, ift. Health, and
frefh Water, I juft now mentioned, idly, Shelter
from the Heat of the Sun. 3dly, Security from ra-
venous Creatures, whether Men or Beaft. 4thlyi
a View to the Sea, that if God fent any Ship
in Sight, I might not lofe any Advantage for my
Deliverance, of which I was not willing to banifh
all my Expectation yet.
In fearch of a Place proper for this, I found a
little Plain on the fide of a rifing Hill, whofe
Front towards this little Plain was fteep as a
Houfe-fide, fo that nothing could come down up-
on me from the Top ; on the Side of this Roclc
F a therg
there was a hollow Place worn a little way in like
the Entrance or Door of a Cave, but there was
not really any Cave or Way into the Rock at all.
On the Flat of the Green, jufl before this hollow
Place, Irefolved to pitch my Tent: This Plain was
not above an hundred Yards broad, and about
twice as long, and lay like a Green before ray
Door, and at the End of it defcended irregularly
every way down into the low Gronnds by the Sea-
fide. It was on the N.N.W, Side of the Hill, fo
that I was fheltered from the Heat every Day, till
it came to a W- and by S. Sun, or thereabouts,
which in thofe Countries is near the Setting.
Before I fet up my Tent, I drew a half Circle
before the hollow Place, which took in about ten
Yards in its Semi-diameter from the Rock, and
twenty Yards in its Diameter, from its Beginning:
and Ending.
In this half Circle I pitch'd two Rows of ftrong
Stakes, driving them into the Ground till they ftood
very firm like £iles, the biggeft End being out of
the Ground about five Foot and a half, and fhar-
pen'd on the Top ; the two Row$ did not ftand
above fix Inches from one another.
Then I took the Pieces of Cable which I had cut
in the Ship, and laid them in Rows one upon.ano-
ther, within the Circle between thefe two Rows
offtakes, up to the Top, placing other Stakes in
the Infide, leaning againft them, about two Foot
and a half high, like a Spur to a Pott, and this
Fence was fo ftrong, that neither Man or Beaft
could get into it or over it: This coft me a great
deal of Time and Labour, efpecially to cut the
Piles in the Woods, bring them to the Place, and
Ji'ive them into the Earth.
The Entrance into this Place I made to be not
t>y a Doer, but by a fhort Ladder, -to go over
the
  _ the Top, which Laddec, when I was in, I lifted
over after me, and fo I was compleatly fenced in,
and fortify'd, as I thought, from all the World,
and confequently flept fecure in the Night, which
otherwife I could not have done, tho'as it appear'd
afterward, there was no need of all this Caution
from the Enemies that I apprehended Danger from.
Into this Fence or Fortrefs, with infinite Labour, •
I carry'd all my Riches, all my Provifions, Am-
munition and Stores, of which you have the Ac-
count above, and I made me a large Tent, which
to preferve me from the Rains, that in one Part of
the Year are very violent there, I made double, viz*
one fmaller Tent within, and one larger Tent a-
bove it, and cover'd the uppermoft with a large
Tarpaulin which I had fav'd among the Sails.
And now I lay no more for a while in the Bed
which I had brought on Shore, but in a Hammock,
which was indeed a very good one, and belong'd
to the Mate of the Ship.
Into this Tent I brought all my Provifions, and
every thing that would fpoil by the Wet, and ha-
ving thus enclos'd all my Goods, I made up the
Entrance, which till now I had left open, aad fo
pafs'd and repafs'd, as I faid, by a fhort Ladder.
Wfcen I had done this, I began to work my
Way into the Rock, and bringing all the Earth and
Stones that I dug down, out thro' my Tent, I
laid 'em up within my Fence in the Nature of a
Terras, that fo it rais'd the Ground within about
a Foot and a half; and thus I made me a Cave juft
behind my Tent, which ferv'd me like a Cellar to
my Houfe.
It coft me much Labour, and many Days, before
all thefe Things were brought to Perieclion, and
therefore I muft go back to fome otherThings which
took up fome of my Thoughts. At the fame time it
F 3 happen'd
happen'd after I had laid my Scheme for the let-
ting up my Tent, and making the Cave, that a
Storm of Rain falling from a thick dark Cloud, a
fudden Flam of Lightning happen'd, and after that.
a. great Clap of Thunder, as is naturally the Efteft
of it; I was not fo much furpriz'd with the Light-
ning, as I was with a Thought which darted into
my Mind as fwift as the Lightning it felf: O my
Powder! my very Heart funk within me, when I
thought, that at one Blaft all my Powder might be
deftroy'd; on which, not my Defence only, but the
providing me Food, as I thought, entirely depen-
ded ; I was nothing near fo anxious about my own
Danger, tho' had the Powder took fire, I had ne-
ver known who had hurt me.
Such Impreffion did this make upon me, that af-
ter the Storm was over, I laid afide all my Works,
my Building, and Fortifying, and apply'd my felf
to make Bags and Boxes to feparate the Powder,
and to keep it a little and a little in a Parcel, in
hope, that whatever might come, it might not
all take Fire at once, and to keep it fo apart, that
it fhould not be poffible to make one Part fire a-
nother. I finiuYd this Work in about a Fortnight,
and I think my Powder, which in all was about
•2401. weight, was divided in not lefs than a Hun-
dred Parcels ; as to the Barrel that had been wet,
I did not apprehend any Danger from that, fo I
plac'd it in my new Cave, which in my Fancy I
call'd my Kitchin ; and the reft I hid up and
down in Holes among the Rocks, fo that no wet
might come to ir} marking very carefully where I
laid it.
. In the Interval of time while this was doingj I
went out once at leaft every Day with my Gun,
as well to divert my felf, as to fee if I could kill any
thing fit for Food, and as near as I could to ac-
quaint
E 7i 1
quaint my felf with what thelfland produc'd. The
firft time I went out I prefeutly difcover'd that
there were Goats in the Ifland, which was a great
. Satisfaction to me; but then it was attended with
this Misfortune to me, viz,. That they were fo
fhy, fo fubtle, and fo fwift of Foot, that it was
the difficulteft thing in the World to come at them :
But I was not difcourag'd at this, not doubting
but I might now and then fhoot one, as it foon hap-
pen'd, for after I had found their Haunts a little,
I laid wait in this Manner for them.. I obferv'd if
they faw me in the Valleys, tho' they were upon
the Rocks, they would run away as in a terrible
Fright; but if they were feeding in the Valleys,
and I was upon the Rocks, they took no Notice
of me, from whence I concluded, that .by the
Pofition of their Opricks, their Sight was fo di-
rected downward, that they did not readily fee
Objects that were above them ; fo afterward I
took this Method, I always climbed the Rocks fir/I
to get above* them, and then had frequently a fair
Mark. The firft {hot I made among thefe Crea-
tures, I kill'd a She-Goat which had a little Kid
by her which fhe gave fuck to, which griev'd me
heartily; but when the Old one fell, the Kid
ftood ftock ftill by her till I come and took her up,
and not only fo, but when I carried the Old one
with me upon my Shoulders, the Kid follow'd
me quite to my Enclofure, upon which I laid down
the Dam, and took the Kid in my Arms, and
carried it over my Pale, in hopes to have bred it
up tame, but it would not eat, fo I was forc'd to
kill it and eat it my felf; thefe two fupply'd me
with Flefh a great while, for I eat fparingly ; and
fav'd my Provifions (my Bread efpecially) as much
as poffibly I could
F 4 Having
Having nowfix'd my Habitation, I found itab-
folutely neceflary to provide a Place to make a
Fire in, and Fewel to burn; and what I did for
that, as alfo how I enlarg'd my Cave, and what
Conveniencies I made, I ftiall give a full Account'
of in its Place: But J muft rirft give fome little
Account of my {elf, and of my Thoughts about
Living, which it may well be fuppofed were not
a few.
I had a difmal Profpea of my Condition; for as
I was not caft away upon that Ifland without be-
ing driven, as is faid, by a violent Storm quite out
of theCourfe of our intended Voyage, and a great
Way, viz,, fome Hundreds of Leagues out of the
ordinary Courfe of the Trade of Mankind, I had
great Rcafon to confider it as a Determination of
Heaven, that in this defolare Place, and in this
defolate Manner I fhouldend my Life; the Tears
would run plentifully down my Face when I made
thefe Reflections, and fometimes I would expoftu^
late with my felf, Why Providencefhould thus
compleatly rnin its Creatures, and render them fa
abfolutely miferable, fo without Help abandon'd,
fo entirely deprefs'd, that it could hardly be ra-
tional to be thankful for fuch a Life.
But fomething always return'dfwift upon me to
pheck thcfe Thoughts, and to reprove me; and
particularly one Day walking with my Gun in my
fland by the Sea-fide, I was very peniive upon the
subject of my prefent Condition, when Reafon as
twere expostulating with me to'ther Way, thus;
Veil, you are in a defolate Condition, 'tis true, but
>ray remember, Where are the reft of you ? Did
iOt you come Eleven of you into the Boat, where
re the Ten? Why were not they fav'd and you
jft ? Why were you fingled cut? Is it better to be
ere or there? and then I pointed to the Sea. All
Evils
Evils are to be confider'd with rhe Good that is in
them, and with what worfe attended them.
Then it occurr'd to me again, how well I was
furnifh'd for my Subfiftance, and what would have
been my Cafe if it had not happen'd, Which was
(in Hundred T'hovfand to one, that the Ship floated
from the Place where fhe firft {truck and was dri-
ven fo near to the Shore that I had time to get
all thefe Things out of her.. What would have
been my Cafe, if I had been to have liv'd in the
Condition in which I at firft came on Shore, with-
out Neceflaries of Life, or Neceflaries.to fupply
and procure them ? Particularly faid I aloud, (tho'
to my felf) what fhould I ha' done without a
Gun, without Ammunition, without any Tools
to make any thing, or to work with, without
Cloaths, Bedding, a Tent, or any manner of
Covering ; and that now I had all thefe to a fuffi-
cierit Quantity, and was in a fair way to provide
my felf in fuch a manner, as to live without
my Gun when my Ammunition was fpent.? fo
that I had a tolerabje View of fubfifling(without
^ny Want as long as I liv'd ; for I coafider'd from
the beginning how I would provide for the Acci-
dents that might happen, and for the time that was
to come, even not only after my Ammunition
fhould be fpent, but even after my Health or
Strength fhould decay.
I confefs I had not entertain'd any Notion of my
Ammunition being deftroy'd at one Blaft, I mean
my Powder being blown up by Lightning, and this
made the Thoughts of it fo furprifing to me when
it lighten'd and thunder'd, as I obferv'd juft now.
And now being to enter into a melancholy
Relation of a Scene of filent Life, fuch perhaps as
was neve* heard of in the World before, I ftiall
take it from its Beginning, and continue it in its
Order

and among them two
or
or three Popifh Prayer-Books, and feveral other
Books, all which I carehiliy fecur'd. And I muft
not forget, that we had in the Ship a Dog and two
Cats, of whofe eminent Hiflory I may have occa^
fion to fay fomething in its Place; for I carry'd
both the Cats with me ; aud as for the Dog, he
jump'd out of the Ship of himfelf, and fwam on
Shore to me the Day after I went on Shore with my
firft Cargo, and was a trufty Servant to me many
Years; I wanted nothing that he could fetch me,
nor any Company that he could make up to me,
I only wanted to have him talk to me, but that
would not do: As I obferv'd before, I found Pen,
Ink and Paper, and I husbanded them to the ut-
rrioft; and Ifhall fhew, that while my Ink lafted,
I kept things very exact ; but after that was gone,
I could not j for I could not make any Ink, by any
Means that I could devife.
And this put me in mind that I wanted many •
things, notwithftanding all that I had amafs'd to-
gether ; and of thefe, this of Ink was one, as aHb
Spade, Pick-Axe and Shovel, to dig or remove
the Earth; Needles, Pins, and Thread; as for
Linnen, I foon learn'd to want that without much
Difficulty.
This want of Tools made every Work I did go
on heavily, and it was near a whole Year before I
had entirely finifhed my little Pale or furrounded
Habitation: The Piles or Stakes, which were as
heavy as I could well lift, were a long time in cut-
ting and preparing in the Woods, and more by far
in bringing home; fo that I fpent fometimes two
Days in cutting and bringing home one of thofe
Pofts, and a third Day in driving it into the Ground;
for which Purpofe I got a heavy Piece of Wood
at firft, but at laft bethought myfelf of one of the
Jron Crows, which however, tho' I found it, yet
it
it made driving thofe Pofts or Piles very labo-
rious and tedious Work.
But what need I ha' been concerned at the Te-
ilioufnefs of any thing I had to do, feeing I had
time enough to do it in, nor had I any other Em-
ployment if that had been over, at leaft, that I
could forefee, except the ranging thelfland tofeek
for Food,, which I did more or lefs every Day.
I now began to confider ferioufly my Condition,
and the Circumftance I was reduce to, and I drew
up the State of my Affairs in Writing, not fo much
to leave them to any that were to come after me,
for I was like to have but few Heirs, as to de-
liver my Thoughts from daily poring upon them,
and afflicting my Mind ; and as my Reafon began
now to maftcr my Defpondency, 1 began to com-
fort my felf as well as I could, and to fet the Good
againir. the Evil, that I might have Something to

very impartially, like Debtor and Creditor, the

to, or relieve me. the Ship in near enough to
the Shore, that I have got-
ten out fo many neceffary
things as will either fupfly
my Wants, or en'able me
to fufply my felf even as
long as I live.
Upon the whole, here was an undoubted Tefti?*
mony, that there was fcarce any Condition in the
World fo miferable, but there was fomething nega-
tive or fomething fofetive to be thankful for in it;
and let this Hand as a Direction from the Experi-
ence of the moft miferable of all Conditions in this
World, that we may always find in it fomething
to comfort ourfclves from, and to fet in the De-
fcription of Good and Evil, on the Credit Side of
the Account.
Having now brought my Mind a little to relifii
my Condition, and given over looking out.to Sea,
to fee if I could fpy a Ship; I fay, giving over
thcfe Things, I began to apply my felf to accommo-
date my way of Living, and to make things as ea-
fy to me as I could.
I have
I have already defcribed my Habitation, which
was a Tent under the Side of a Rock, furrounded
with a flrong Pale ofPofts and Cables, but I might
now rather call f it a Wall, for I rais'd a kind of
Wall up againft ft of Turfs, about two Foot thick
on the Outfide, and after fome time-, I think it
was a Year and half, I rais'd Rafters from it, lean-
ing to the Rock, and thatch'd or cover'd it with
Boughs of Trees, and fuch things as I could get to
keep out the Rain, which I found at fome times of
the Year very violent.
I have already obferv'd how I brought all my
Goods into this Pale, and into the Cave which I
had made behind me: But I muft obferve too
that at firft this was a confus'd Heap of Goods,
which as they lay in no Order, fo they took up
all my Place; I had no room to turn my felf; So
I fet my felf to enlarge my Cave and Works far-
ther into the Earth r"fbr it was a loofe fandy Rock,
which yielded eafily to the Labour I beftowedon
it: And fo when I found I was pretty fafe as to
Beafts of Prey, I work'd fideways to the Right
Hand into the Rock; and then turning to the Right
again, work'd quite out, and made me a Door to
come out, on the Outlideof my Pale or Fortifi-
cation.
This gave me not only Egrefs and Regrefs, as
it were a Back-way to my Tent and to my Store-
houfe, but gave me room to flow my Goods.
And now I began to apply my felf to make fuch
neceflary things as I found Imoft wanted, particu-
larly a Chair and a Table; for without thefe I was
not able to enjoy the few Comforts I had in the
World ; I could not write or eat, or feveral things
with fo much Pleafure without a Table.
So I went to work; and here I muft needs ob-
ferve, that as Reafon is the Subftance and Origi-
nal
nal of the Mathematicks, fo by ftating and fqiiar-
ing every thing by Reafon, and by making the
mofr rational Judgment of things', every Man may
bein time Mafter of every mechanick Art. I had
never handled a Tool in my Life, and yet in time
by Labour, Application and Contrivance, I found
at laft that I wanted nothing but I could have made
it, efpecially if I had had Tools ; however, I
I made abundance of things, even without Tools,
'and fome with no more Tools than an Adze and
a Hatchet, which perhaps were never made that
way before, and that with infinite Labour: For
Example, If I wanted a Board, I had no other Way
but to cut down a Tree, fet it on an Edge before
me, and hew it flat on either Side with my Axe,
till I ha4 brought it to be as thin as a Plank, and
then dubb it fmooth with my Adze. It is true,
by this Method I could make but one Board out
of a whole Tree, but this I had no Remedy for
but Patience, any more than I had for the prodi-
gious deal of Time and Labour which it took me
up to make a, Plank or Board : But my Time or
Labour was little worth, and fo it was as well em-
ploy'd one way as another.
However, I made me a Table and a Chair, as
I obferv'd above, in the firft Place, and this I did
out of the fhort Pieces of Boards that I brought
on my Raft from the Ship: But when I had
wrought out fome Boards, as above, I made large
Shelves of the Breadth of a Foot and' a Half one
over another, all along one Side of my Cave, to
lay all my Tools, Nails, and Iron-work, and in a
Word, to feparate every thing at large in their
Places, that I might come eafilyatthem ; I knock'd
Pieces into the Wall of the Rock to hang my Guns
and all things that would hang up. s
So
So that had my Cave been to befeen, it looked
like a general Magazine of all neceflary things,
and I had every thing fo ready at my Hand, that
it was a great Pleafure to me to fee all my Goods
in fuch Order, and efpecially to find my Stock of
all Neceflaries fo great.
And now it was when I began to keep a Jour-
nal of every Day's Employment, tor indeed at firft
I was in too much a Hurry, and nor only Hurry
as to Labour, but in too much Difcompofure of
Mind, and my Journal would ha'been full of many
dull things. For Example, I muft havefaid thus:
Seft. the 3oth, After I got to Shore, and had efcap'd
drowning, inftead of being thankful to God for
my Deliverance, having firft vomited with the
great Quantity of fait Water which was gotten
into my Stomach, and recovering my felf a little, I
ran about the Shore, wringing my Hands, and beat-
ing my Head and Face, exclaiming at my Mifery,
and crying out, I was undone, undone, till tir'd
and faint I was forc'd to lye down oathe Ground
to repofe, but durft not fleep for fear of being de-
vour'd.
Some Days after this, and after I had been on
board the Ship, and got all that I could out of
her, yet I could not forbear getting up to the Top
of a little Mountain, and looking out to Sea in
hopes of feeing a Ship, then fancy at a vaft Di-
fiance I fpy'd a Sail, pleafcmy felf with the Hopes
of it, and then after looking fteadily till I was al-
moft blind, lofe it quite, and fit down and weep
like a Child, and thus encreafe my Mifery by my
Folly.
But having gotten over thefe things in fome Mea-
fure, and having fettled my Houfhold-Stuffand Haj
bitation, made me a Table and a Chair, and all
as handfome about me as Icouid, I began to keep
my
r
my journal, of which I fhall here give you the
Copy (tho' in it will be told all thefe Particulars
over again) as long as it lafted, for having no
more Ink, I was forc'd to leave it off.
The JOURNAL;
i-* »
SEptember 30. itfjp. I poor miferable Rcbinfoh
Crufoe, being fhipwreck'd, during a dreadful
Storm, in the Offing, came on Shore on this dif-
mal unfortunate Ifland, which I call'd, 'The I/land of
Defpair, all the reft of the Ship's Company being
drown'd, and my felf almoft dead.
All the reft of that Day I fpent in afflicting my
felf at the difmal Circumftances I was brought to*
•viz,. I had neither Food, Houfe, Cloaths, Weapon
or Place to fly to, and in Defpair of any Relief
faw nothing but Deatli before me, either that I
{hould be devour'd by wild Beafts, murther'd by
Savages, or ftarv'd to Death for want of Food. At
the Approach of Night, I flept in a Tree for Fear
of wild Creaturesj but flept foundly tho' it rain'd
all Night.
Ottober i. In the Morning I faw to my great
Surprize the Ship had floated with the high Tide^
and was driven on Shore again much nearer the
Ifland, which as it was fome Comfort on one handi
for feeing her fit upright, and not broken to Pieces*
I hop'd, if the Wind abated, I might get on board,
and get fome Food and Neceflaries out of her for
my Relief; fo on the other hand, it renew'd my
Grief at the Lofs of my Comrades, who I inu-
gin'd if we had all ftaid on Board might have»
fav'd the Ship, or at leaft that they would not have
been all drown'd as they were; and that had the
Men been fav'd, we might perhaps have built us a
Boat out of the Ruins of the Shipj to have car-
G
ried us to fome other Part of the World, I fpent
great part of this Day in perplexing my felf on
thefe things; but at length feeing the Ship almoit
dry, I went upon the Sand as near as I could, and
then fwam on Board j this Day alfo it continu'd
raining, tho' with no Wind at all. - ^
From the ift of O^oler to the 24th. All thef$
Days entirely fpcnt in many feveral Voyages to
get all I could out of the Ship, which I brought
on Shore, every Tide of Flood, upon Rafts. Much
Rain alfo in thefe Days, tho' with fome Intervals
of fair Weather: But, it feems, this was the rainy
Seafon.
Oct. 20. I overfct my Raft, and all the Goods
I had got upon it, but being in fhoal Water, and
the things being chiefly heavy, I recover'd many
of them when the Tide was out.
0:1. 25. It rain'd all Night and all Day, with
fome Gulls of Wind, during which time the Ship
broke in pieces, the Wind blowing a little harder
than before, and was no more to be feen, except
the Wreck of her, and that only at low Water.
I fpcnt this Day in covering and fecuring the Goods
which I had fav'dj that Rain might not fpoil
them-
OJI. 26. I walk'd about the Shore almoft all
Day to find out a Place to fix my Habitation,
greatly concern'd to fecnre my felf from anyAttack.
in the Night, either from wild Beafls or Men.
Towards Night I fix'd upon a proper place under
a Rock, and mark'd out a Semi-Circle for my En-
campment, which I refolv'd to ftrengthen with a
•Work, Wall, or Fortification made of double Piles,
lin'd within with Cable, and without with Turf.
From the atfth to the joth I work'd very hard
in carrying ^il my Goods to my new Habitation
1
tho' foms part of the time it rain'd exceeding
hard.
The 31ft in the Morning I went out into the
Ifland with my Gun to fee for fome Food, and dif-
eover the Country; when f kilfd a. She-Goat, and
her Kid follow'd me home, which I afterwards
kiil'd alfo, becaufe it would not feed.
November i. Ifet up my Tent under a Rock, and
lay there for the firft Night, making it as large as
I could with Stakes driving in to fwing my Ham-
mock* upon.
Nov. 2.1 fet up all my Chefts and Boards, and
', the Pieces of Timber which made my Rafts, and
with them form'd a Fence round me, a little with-
in the Place I had mark'd out for my Fortifi-
cation. *
Nov. 3.1 went out with my Gun, and kiil'd two
Fowls like Ducks, which were very good Food.
In the Afternoon went to work to make me a
Table.
Nov. 4. This Morning I began to order my times
of Work, of going out with my Gun, time of
Sleep, and time ofDiverfion, viz,. Every Morning
1 walk d out with my Gun for two or three Hours
if it did not Rain, then employ'd myfelf to work
till about Eleven a-clock, then eat what I had to
live on, and from Twelve to Two I lay down to
ficep, the Weather being exceffive hot, and then,
in the Evening to work again: The working Part
of this Day and of the next were wholly employed
in making my Table, for I was yet but a very forry
Workman, tho' Time and Necefllty made me a
compleat natural Mechanick foon after, as I believe
it would do any one elfe.
Nov. 5., This Day went abroad with my Gun
and my Dog, and kill'd a wild Cat, her Skin
pretty loft, but her Flefh good for nothing: Every
G i " • Creature
Conveniency. Note, Three Things I wanted ex-
ceedingly for this Work, viz,, a Pick-axe, a Shovel,
and a Weeel-barrow or Basket, fo I defined from
my Work, and began to confider how to fupply
that Want, and make me fome Tools: As for a
Pick-axe, I made ufe of the Iron Crows, which
were proper enough, tho' heavyj but the next
thing was a Shovel or Spade ; this was fo abfo-
lutely necefl'ary, that indeed I could do nothing ef-
fectually without it; but what kind of one to make
I k«ew not.
Nw. 18. The next Day in fearching the Woods
J[ found a Tree of that Wood, or like it, which
in the Brafils they call ;he Iron Tree, for its ex-
ceeding Hardnefs; of this, with great Labour and
almoft fpoilingmyAxe, I cut a piece, and brought
it home too with Difficulty enough, for it was ex-
ceeding heavy.
The exceffive Hardnefs of the Wood, and having
no other way, made me a long while upon this
Machine j for I work'd it effectually by little
and little into the Form of a Shovel or Spade,
the Handle exactly fhap'd like ours in England,
•only that the broad Part having no Iron fhod up-
on it at Bottom, it would not laft me fo long;
however it ferv'd well enough for the ufes which I
had occalion to put it to; but never was a Shovel,
I believe, made^ after that Fafhion, or fo long a
making.
I was ftill deficient, for I wanted a Basket or a
Wheel-barrow j a Basket I could not make by any
means, having no fuch things as Twigs that would
bend to make Wicker Ware, at leaft none yet found
out; and as to a Wheel-barrow, I fancy d I could
make all but the Wheel, but that I had no Notion
of, neither did I know how to go about it j befides
I had no poffible way to make the Iron Gudgeons.
03 for
for the Spindle or Axis of the Wheel to run in, fo
I gave it over; and fo for carrying away the Earth
which I dug out of the Cave, 1 made me a Thing
likeaHodd which the Labourers carry Mortar in,
when they ferve the Bricklayers.
This was not fo difficult to me as the making
the Shovel; and yet this, and the Shovel, and the
Attempt wh'ch I made in vain, to make a Wheel-
barrow, took me up nolefs than four Days, I mean
always, excepting my Morning Walk with my Gun,
which I feldom fail'd ; and very fcldom fail d alfo
bringing Home fomething for to eat,
Nov. 23. My other Work having now flood {till,
becaufe of my making thefe Tools; when they
were finifh'd, I went on, and working every Day,
as my Strength and Time allow'd, I fpcnt eigh-
teen Days entirely in widening and deepening my
Cave, that it might hold my Goods commodi-
oufly.
Note, During all this Time, I work'd to make
this .Room or Cave fpacious enough to accommo-
date me as a Warehoufe or Magazine, a Kitchen,
a Dining-room, and a Cellar; as for my Lodging,
I kept. to the Tent, except that fometimes in the
wet Seafon of the Year, it rain'd fo hard that I
could riot keep my fetf dry, which caus'd me after'
wards to coverall my Place within my Pale with
long Poles in the Form of Rafters, leaning againft
the Rock, and load them with Flags and large
Leaves of Trees like a. Thatch.
December 10. I began now to think my Cave
or Vault finifhed, when on a fudden (it feems I •
had made it too large) a great Quantity of Earth
I'll down from the Top and one Side, fo much
that in fhort it frighted me, and not without Rea-
on too; for if I had been under it, I had never
wanted a Grave-digger: Upon this Difafter I had
a grea.C
a great deal of Work to do over again ; for I had
the loofe Earth to carry out, and which was of
more Importance, I had the Cjeling to prop up, fo
that I might be fure no more would come down.
D. c. 11. This Day I went to Work with it accord-
ing! y, and got two Shores or Pofts pitch'd upright
to the Top, with two Pieces of Boards a-crofs over
each Poft, this I finim'd the next Day; and fetting
more Pofts up with Boards, in about a Week more I
had the Roof fecur'dj and the Pofts ftanding in
Rows,ferv'd me for Partitions to part of: my Houfe.
Dec. 17. From this Day to the Twentieth I
plac'd Shelves, and knock'd up Nails on the Pofts
to hang every Thing up that could be hung up,
and now I began to be in fome Order within
Doors.
Dec. 20. Now I carry'd every Thing into the
Cave, and began to furnifh my Houfe, and fet up
fome Pieces of Boards, like a Drefler, to order my
Victuals upon, but Boards began to be very fcarce
with me; alfo I made me another Table.
Dec. 24. Much Rain ail Night and all Day, no
ftirringout.
Dec. 25. Rain all Day.
Dec. ^6. No Rain, and the Earth much cooler.
than before, and pleafanter.
Dec. 27. Kill'd a young Goat, and lam'd ano-
ther fo that I catch'd it, and led it Home in a
String; when I had it Home, I bound and fplin-
•ter'd up its Leg which was broke. N. B. I
took fuch Care of it, that it liv'd, and the Leg
grew well and as ftrong as ever; but by nurfing
it fo long it grew tame, and fed upon the little
•Gfetfft at my Door, and would not go away:
This was the firft Time that I entertain'd a*
Thought of breeding up fome tame Creatures,
G 4 true
that I might have Food when my Powder and Shot
was all fpent.
Dec. 28, 29, 50. Great Heats and no Breeze ;
{o that there was no ftirring abroad, except in the
Evening for Food ; this Time I fpent in putting
all my Things in Order within Doors.
January i. Very hot ftill, but I went abroad ear-
ly and late with my Gun, and lay ftill in the middle
of the Day. This Evening, going farther into the
Valleys, which lay towards the Center of the Ifland,
I found there was plenty of Goats, tho' exceeding
Ihy and hard to come at ; however I refolv'd to try
if I cofrld not bring my Dog to hunt them down.
Jan. 2. Accordingly, the next Day, I went out
with my Dog, and fet him upon the Goats ; but
I was miftaken, for they all fac'd about upon the
Dog; and he knew his Danger tod well, for 'he
would not come near them.
Jan. 3. I began my Fence or Wall ; which, be-
ing ftill jealous of my being attack'd by fome Bo-
dy, I refolv'd to make very thick and ftrong.
* ' • •
N. B. This Wall being defcrib'd befort, I
• furfofely omit what was faid in the 'Jour-
nal; it is fufficient to obferve, T'hat Iwas
no lefs T'ime than from the 3 d of January
to the iqth of April, -working, fini[hing,and
• perfecting this Wall, tho' it was no men
than about 24 Tards in Length, being a half
Circle from one Place in the Rock to another
Place about eight Tards from it, the Door
of the Cave being in the Center behind ;>.
All this Time I work'd very hard, the Rains
hindering me many Days, nay, fometimes Weeks
together; but I thought I fhould never be perfefi-
ly fecure 'till this Wall -was finifVd; and it is
fcarce
fcarce credible what inexpreffible Labour every
Thing was done with, efpecially the bringing
Piles out of the Woods, and driving them into the
Ground, for I made them much bigger than I need
to have done.
When this Wall was fintfh'd, and the Out-fide
doilble fenc'd with a Turf-Wall rais'd up clofe to
it, I perfwaded my felf that if any People were
to come on Shore there, thejf would not perceive
any Thing like a Habitation; and it was very well
I did fo, as may be obferv'd hereafter upon a very
remarkable Occafion.
During this Time, I made my Rounds in the
Woods for Game every Day when the Rain ad-
mitted me, and made frequent Difcoveries in thefe
Walks of fomething or other to my Advantage ;
p articularly I found a kind of a wild Pidgeons, who
built not as Wood Pidgeons in a Tree, but rather
as Houfe Pidgeons, in the Holes of the Rocks;
and taking fome young ones, I endeavoured to
breed them up lame, and did fo ; but when they
grew older they flew all away, which perhaps was
at firft for Want of feeding them, for I had no-
thing to give them; however I frequently found
their Neils, and got their young ones, which were
very good Meat.
And now in the managing my Houfhold Affairs,
I found my felf wanting in many Things, which
I thought at tirft it was impoflible for me to make,,
as indeed as to fome of them it was; for Inflame,
I could never make a Cask to be hoop'd, I had a
fmail Runlet or two, as I obferv'd before,b\.\t 1 cou'd
never arrive to the Capacity of making one by them
tho' I fpent many Weeks about it; I could neither
put in the Heads, or joint the Staves fo true to one
another, as to make them hold Water, fo I £ave
c-lut alfo over.
*»»•••'.• In
In the next Place, I was at a great Lofs for Can-
dle ; fo that as foonas ever it was dark, which was
generally by Seven-a-Clock, I was oblig'd to go to
Bed : I rcmembred the Lump of Bees-wax with
which I made Candles in my African Adventure,
but I had none of that now; the only Remedy I
had, was, that when I had kiil'd a Goat, I fav'd
the Tallow, and with a little Djfh made of Clay,
which I bak'd in the S^n, to which I added a Wick
of fome Oakum, I made me a Lamp; and this
gave me Light, tho' not a clear fleady Light like
a Candle ; in the middle of all my Labours it hap-
pen'd, that rumaging my Things, I found a little
Bag, which, as I hinted before, had been fill'd with
Corn for the feeding of Poultry, not for this Vo-
yage, but before, as I fuppofe, when the Ship •
came from Lisbon; what little Remainder of Corn
had been in the Bag, was all devour'd with the
Rats, and I faw nothing in the Bag but Husks and
Duft; 4nd being willing to have the Bag for fome
other Ufe, I think it was to put Powder in, when I
divided it for fear of the Lightning, or fome luch
Ufe, I fhook the Husks of Corn out of it on one
Side of my Fortification under the Rock.
It was a little before the great Rains, juft now
mention'd, that I threw this Scuff away, taking no
Notice of any Thing, and not io much as remem-
bring that I had thrown any Thing there ; when
about a Month after, or thereabout, I faw fome
few Stalks of fomething Green fhooring out of the
Ground, which I fancy'd might be fome Plant I
had not feen, but I was furpriz'd and perfectly a-
ftonifh'd, when after a little longer Time, I faw
about ten or twelve Ears come out, which were
perfect green Barley of the fame Kind as our Euro-*
oean. nay, as our Englijb Barley.
It
C 9i 3
It is irnpoffible to exprefs the Aftonifiiment and
Confufion of my Thoughts on this Occafion; I
had hitherto acted upon no religious Foundation at
all; indeed I had very few Notions of. Religion in
ray Head, or had entertain'd aty Senfe of any
Thing that had befallen me, otherwife than as a.
Chance, or, as we lightly fay, what pleafes God,
without fo much as enquiring into the End of Pro-
vidence in thefe Things, or his Order in gover-
ning Events in the World : But after I faw Barley
grow there, in a Climate which I know was not
proper for Corn, and efpeciaily that I knew not
how it came there, it ftartled me ftrangely, and I
began to fuggeft, that God had miraculoufly caus'd
this Grain to grow without any Help of Seed
(own, and that it was fo directed purely for my
Sufienance on that wild miferable Place.
This touch'd my Heart a little, and brought
Tears out of my Eyes, and I began to blefs my
felf, that fuch a Prodigy of Nature fbould happen
upon my Account; and this was the more flrange
to me, becaufe I faw near it ftill all along by the
Side of the Rock, fome other ftragjgling Stalks,
which prov'd to be Stalks of Rice, and which I
knew, becaufe I had feen it grow in Africa, when
I was afhore there.
I not only thought thefjj the pure Productions
of Providence for my Support, but not doubting,
but that there was moie in the Place, I went all
over that Part of the Ifland, where I had been
before peering, in every Corner, and under every
Rock, to fee for more of it, but I could not find
any; at laft it occurr'd to my Thought, that I hacl
Ihook a Bag of Chickens Meat out in that Place,
and then the Wonder began to ceafe; and I muff
confefs, my religious ThankfuJnefs to God's Pro-
vidence bsgan to abate too upon the Difcovc-
• • ring
ring that all this was nothing but whatwas com,*.
mon; tho' I ought to have been as thankful for fo
ftrange and unforefeen Providence, as if it had been
miraculous; for it was really the Work of Pro-
vidence as to me, that fhould order or appoint, '
10 or 12 Grains of Corn fhould remain unfpoil'd
(when the Rats had deftroy'd all the reft) as if it
had been dropt from Heaven: as aHo that I
fhonld throw it out in that particular Place,
where it being in the Shade of a high Rock, it
fprang up immediately; whereas if I had thrown it
it any where elfe at that Time, it had been.' burnt
up and deftroy'd.
I carefully fav'd the Ears of Corn, you may be
fure in their Seafon, which was about the End of
June, and laying up every Corn, I refolv'd tofow
them all again, hoping in Time to have fome
Quantity fufficient to fupply me with Bread; but it
was not till the 4th Year that I could allow my •
felf the leaft Grain of this Corn to eat, and even
then but fparingly, as 1 fhall fay afterwards in its
Order; for I loft all that I fow'd the firft Seafon, by
not ob/erving*the proper Time; for I fow'd it juft
before the dry Seafon, fo that it never came up at
all, at leaft, not as it would have have done : Of
which in its Place.
Beiides this Barley, there was, as above io or
50 Stalks of Rice, which I preferv'd with the fame
Care, and whofe Ufc was of the fame Kind or
to the fame Purpofc, (•»«,) to make me Bread, or
rather Food; for I found Ways to cook it up with-
out baking, tho11 did that alfo after fome Time.
But to return to my Journal.
I work'd exceffive hard thefe three or four
Vfonths to get my Wall done; vand the i4th of
April Iclofedit up, contriving to go into it, not
:>y a Door, but over the Wall by a Ladder, that
* there
there might be no Sigh in the Out-fide of my
bitation.
April 16. I finifh'd the Ladder, fo I went up with
the Ladder to the Top, and then pull'd it up after
me, and let it down on the Infide.- This was a
compleat Enclofure to me ; for within I had Room
enough, and nothing could come at me from with-
out, unlefs it could firft mount my Wall.
The very next Day after this Wall was finifhed,
I had almoft had all my Labour overthrown at
once, and my felf kill'd ; the Cafe was thus : As I
was bufy in the Infide of it, behind my Tent, juft in
the Entrance into my Cave, I was terribly frighted
with' a moft dreadful furprizing Thing indeed;
tor all on a fudden I found the Earth come crum-
bling down from the Roof of my Cave, and from
the Edge of the Hill over my Head, and two of
the Pofts I had fer up in the Cave crack'd in a
friglftful manner: I was heartily feared, but thought
nothing of what was really the Caufe, only think-
ing that the top of my Cave was falling in, as fome
of it had done before; and for fear I fhou'd be bu-
ry'd in it, I ran forward to my Ladder, and not
thinking my felf fafe there neither, I got over my
Wall for fear of the Pieces of the Hill which I ex-
pected might roll down upon me : I was no fooner
ftept down upon the firm Ground, but I plainly
faw it was avertible Earthquake, for the Ground I
flood on {hook three times at about eight Mi-
nutes diftance, with three fach Shocks, as would
have overturned the ftrongeft Building that could
be fuppos'd to have flood on the Earth; and a
great Piece of the Top of a Rock, which .flood a-
bout half a Mile from. me next the Sea, fell down
with fuch a terrible Noife, as I never heard in all
my Life a I perceiv'd alfo, the very Sea was put
into violent Motion by it; and I believe the
Shocks
Shocks were flronger under the Water than on the
Ifland.
I was fo arrm'd with the Thing it felf, having
neverfeit the like, or difcourfed with any one that fw;
had, that I was like one dead or ftupify'd; and the bu
Motion of the Earth made myT..onuch lick, like te
one that was tofs'd at Sea; bur die Noife of the to
falling of the Rock awak'd me, as it were, and rou- a
zing me from the fhipified Condition I was in,fiU'd
me with Horror, and I thought of nothing then to
but the Hill falling upon my Tent, and all my Houf- Sii
hold Goods, and burying all at once; and this dti
funk my very Soul within me a fecond time. foi
After the third Shock was over, and I felt no E
more for fome time, I began to take Courage, and ai
yet I had not Heart enough to get over my Wall a-
gain, for fear of being buried alive, but fat ftill t
upon the Ground, greacly caft down and difconfo- t
late, not knowing what to do .• All this while I»had
not the leaft ferious religious Thought, nothing
but the common, Lord ha Mercy upon me; and P
when it was over, that went away too. a
While I fat thus, I found the Air over-caft, and
grow cloudy, as if it would rain ; foon after that t
the Wind rofe by little and little, fo that in lefs i
than half an Hour it blew a moft dreadful Hurri-
cane .. The Sea was all on a fudeen cover'd over
with Foam and Froth, the Shore was gover'd with
the Breach of the Water, the Trees were torn up
by the Roots, and a terrible Storm it was ; and
this held about three Hours, and then began to
abate, and in two Hours more it was ftark calm,
and began to rain very hard.
All this while I fat upon the Ground very much
terrify'd and dejeded, when on a fudden it came
into my Thoughts, that thefe Winds and Rain being
the Confequence of'the Earthquake, the Earthquake
itfelf
itfelf was fpent and over, and I might venture into
my Cave again: With this Thought my Spirits
began to revive, and the Rain alfo helping to pcr-
fwade me, I went in and fat down in my Tent,
but the Rain was fo violent, that my Tent wa*
ready to be beaten down with it; and I was forc'd
to go into my Cave, tho' very much afraid and un-
eafy for fear it fhould fall on my Head.
This violent Rain forc'd me to a new Work, wz..
to cut a Hole thro' my new Fortification like a
Sink to let Water go ous, which would elfe have
drown'd my Cave. After I had been in my Cave
fome Time, and found {till no more Shocks of the
Earthquake follow, 1 began to be more compos d;
and now to fupport my Spirits, which indeed wan-
ted it very much, I went to my little Store, and
took a fmall Sup of Rum, which however I did
then and always very fparingly, knowing I could
have no more when that was gone.
It continu'd raining all that Night, and great
Part of the next Day, fo that I could not ftir
abroad, but my Mind being more compos'd, I be-
gan to think of what I had beft do, concluding*
that if the Ifland was fubjed tothefe Earthquakes,
there would be no living for me in a Cave, but I
muft conlider of building me fome little Hut in an
open Place, which I might furround with a Wallas
1 had done here, and fo make my felf fecilrc from
wild Beafts or Men: But concluded, if I ftaid
where I was, I fhould certainly, one Time or other,
be bury'd alive.
With thefe Thoughts I refolv'd to remove my
Tent from- the Place where it flood, which was.
juft under the hanging Precipice of the Hill, and
which,if it fhould be ftiaken again, would certain-
ly fall upon my Tent : And I fpent the two next
Pays
Days, being the ipthahd 2oth of Afril, in contri-
ving where and I how to remove my Habitation.
The fear of being fwallow'd up alive, made me
that I never flept in quiet, and yet the Apprehen-
fion of lying abroad without any Fence was alraoft
equal to it j but ftiu when Ilook'd about and fi 5
how everything was put in order, how pleafantly
conceal dlwas, and how fafcfrom Danger, it made
me very loth to remove.
In the mean time it occur'd to me that it wouTd
JST a af dCal of tlme for me to do d"* *"d
that 1 muft be contented to run the Venture where
J was, till I had form'd a Camp for my felf, and
had fecured it fo as to remove to it : So with this
Kefo Hmon I compos'd my felf for a time, and re-
lolv d that I would go to work with all fpeed to build
me a Wall with Piles and Cables, &c. in a Circle
as before; and fet my Tent up jn jt when it was
timfh d, but that I would venture to ftay where I
was till it was finifh'd and fit to remove to. This
was the 2 1 ft.
22. The next Morning I began to confider
Means to put this Refolve in Execution, but I
was at a great lofs about my Tools ; I had three
large Axes and abundance of Hatchets, (for we
carried the Hatchets for Traffic!,- with the Indians)
but with much choping and cutting knotty hard
Wood, they were all full of Notches and dull,
and tho'Ihad a Grindftone, I could not turn it and'
grind my Tools too; this coil me as much Thought
as a Statefman would have beftow'd upon a grand
Point of Politicks, or a Judge upon the Life and
Death of a Man. At length I contriv'd a Wheel '
with a String, to turn it with my Foot, that I
might have both my Hands at Liberty : Ncte, I had
never feen any fuch thing in England, or at leaft
not to take Notice how it was done, tho' finc.e I
have
obferv'd it i's very common there; befides
that, my Grind-ftone was very large and heavy;
This Machine coft me a full Week's Work to bring
it to Perfection.
April 28, 29. Thefe two whole Days I took
up in grinding my Tools, my Machine for turning
my Grind-ftone performing very we\l.
April 30, Having perceiv'd my Bread had been
low a great while, now I took a Survey of itj
and reduced myfelf to one Bisket-cake a Day,
which made my Heart very heavy.
May i, In the Morning looking towards the
Sea-fide, the Tide being low, Jfaw fomething lie '•,
on the Shore bigger than ordinary; and it look'd
like a Cask ; when 1 came to it, I found a fniall
Barrel, and two or three Pieces of the Wreck of.^,
the Ship, which were driven on Shore by the late"
Hurricane ; and looking towards the Wreck itfelf^.
I thought it feem'd to lie higher out of the Water
than it us'd to do: I examin'd the Barrel which i
was driven on Shore, and foon found it was a
Barrel of Gun-powder, but it had taken Water,
and the Powder was cak'd as hard as a Stone ;
however I roll'd it farther on Shore for the prefent,
and went on upon the Sands as near as I could t'd
the Wreck of the Ship to look for more. > „,
When I came down to the Ship,I found it ftrange-
ly remov'd; the Fore-caftle, which lay before bu-
ry'd in Sand, was heav'd up at leaft fix Foot; and | ,
the Stern, which was brbke to pieces, and parted
from the reft by the Force of the Sea, foon after I
had left rummaging her, was tofs'd, as it were,upj
and caft on one fide, and the Sand was throwti
fo high on that fide next her Stern,' that whereas
there was a great Place of Water before, fo'that I
could not corrie within 2 Quarter of a Mile of the
Wreck without fwimmine, I. could now walk *•;•
ti uifi
[ 98 I
quite up to her when the Tide was out; I was fur-
priz'd with this at firft, but fopn concluded it muft
be done by the Earthquake: And as by this Vio-
lence the Ship was more broken open than former-
ly, fo many things. c•ame daily on Shore, which
the Sea had loofen'd, and which the Winds and
Water rolled by degrees to the Laud.
This wholly diverted my Thoughts from the
Defign of removing my Habitation j and I bufied
myfelf mightily that Day efpecially, in fearching
whether I could make any way into the Ship; but
I found nothing was to be expe&ed of that Kind,
for that all the Infide of the Ship was choak'd up
with Sand: However, as I had learnt not to d§-
fpair of any thiag, I refolvM to pull every thing
to pieces that I could of the Ship, concluding,
. that every thing I could get from her, would be
of fome Ufe or other to me.
May •}, I began with my Saw, and cut a Piece
of a Beam thro", which I thought held fome of the
upper Part or Quarter-Deck together, and when
I .had cut it thro', I clear'd away the Sand as well
as I could from the Side which lay higheft ; but
the Tide coming in, I was obliged to give over
for that time.
May 4, I went a fifhing, but caught not ope Fifii
that I durft eat of, till. I was weary of my Sport;
when juft going to leave off, I caught a young
Dolphin. I had made me a long Line of fome
Rope Yarn, but I had no Hooks, yet I frequently
caught Fifh enough, as much as I car'd to eat;
all which I dry'd in the Sun, and eat them dry. .
May y, Work'd on the Wreck, cut another
Beam afunder, and brought three great Fir Planks
off from the Decks, which I ty'd 'together, and
made fwirn on Shore, when the Tide of Flood
came on. '
May
* *
 ^ S,, Work'd on the Wreck, got federal IroA
Bolts om'of her, and other Pieces of Iron-work^
work'd very hard, and came Home very much
tir'd, and had Thoughts of giving it over.
May j, Went to the Wreck again, but with an
Intent not to work, but found the Weight of the
Wreck had broke itfelf down, the Beams being cut>
that feveral Pieces of the. Ship feem'd to lie loofe,
and the Infide of the Hold lay fo open, that I could
fee into it,, but almoft full of Water and Sand.
May 8, Went to the Wreck, and carry'd an IroA
Crow to wrench up the Deck, which lay now
quite clear of the Water or Sand; I wrench'd open
two Planks, and brought them on Shore alfo with
the Tide : I left the Iron Crow in the Wreck for
next Day.
May 9, Went to the Wreck, and with the Crow1
made way into the Body of the Wreck, and felc
feveral Casks, and loofen'd them with the Crow*
but ceuld not break them up ; I felt alfo the Roll
of Englijb Lead, and could ftir it, but it was too
heavy to remove.
May 10,1,1, i2, 13, *4, Went every Day to
the Wreck, and got a great deal cf Pieces of
Timber, and Boards, or > Plank, and 2 or 300
Weight of Iron.
May 15, I carry'd two Hatchets to try if I
could not cut a Piece off of the Roll of Lead, by
placing the Edge of one Hatchet, and. driving it
with the other; but as it lay about a Foot and a
half in the Water, I could not make any Blow to
drive the Hatchet.
May itf, It had blow'd hard in the Night, and
the Wreck appear'd more broken by the Force of
the Water; but I ftaid fo long in the Woods td
get Pidgeons for Food, that the Tide prevented
me going to the Wreck that Day.
Ha May
A/ay 17, I faw feme Pieces of the \Vreck blowrt (,BJ(
on Shore, at a great Diftance, near two Miles off
me, but refolv'd to fee what they were, and found
it was a Piece of the Head, but too heavy for me
to bring away. ^
May 14, Every Day to this Day I work'd on
the Wreck, and with hard Labour I loofen'd fome
things fo much with the Crow, that the firft
blowing Tide feveral Casks floated out, and two
of the Seamens Chefts ; but the Wind blowing
from the Shore, nothing came to Land that Day
but Pieces of Timber, and a Hogfhead which had
fome Bfaul Pork in it, but the Salt-water and
the Sand had fpoil'd it.
I continu'd this Work every Day to the ijth
of June, except the Time necefiary to get Food,
which I always appointed, during this part of
my Employment, to be when the Tide was up,
that I might be ready when it was ebb'd out;
and by this time I had gotten Timber, and Plank,
and Iron-woik enough to have built a good Boat,
if I had known how; and alfo, I got at feveral
times, and in feveral Pieces, near 100 weight of
the Sheet-Lead.
June 16, Going down to the Sea-fide, I found
a large Tortoife or Turtle ; this was the firft I
had feen, which it feems was only my Misfortune,
not any' Defect of the Place, or Scarcity; for had
I happen'd to be on the other Side of the Ifland,
I might have had Hundreds of them every Day,
as I found afterwards; but perhaps had paid
dear enough for them.
v June 17, I fpent in •cooking the Turtle; I
found in her threefcore Eggs; and her Flefh was
to me at that time the moft favoury and pleafant
that:ever I tafted in my Life, having had noFlefh,
... --. . but
but of. Goats and Fowls, fince I landed in this
horrid Place.
June 18, Rain'd all Day, and I ftay'd within.
I thought at this time the Rajn felt cold, and I
was fomething chilly, which I knew was not
ufual in that Latitude.
June 19, Very ill, and fhivering, as if the Wea-
ther had been cold.
June 20, No Reft all Night, violent Pains in
my Head, and feverifh.
June 21, Very ill, frighted almoft to Death
with the Apprehenfions of my fad Condition, to
be fick, and no Help : Pray'd to G o D for the
firft time fince the Storm off of Hull, but fcarce
knew what I faid, or why; my Thoughts being
all confufed. ,*
June 22, A little better, but under dreadful
Apprehenfions of Sicknefs.
June 23, Very bad again, cold and fhivering,
and then a violent Head-ach.
June 24, Much better.
June 25, An Ague very violent; the Fit held
me feven Hours, cold Fit and hot, with faint
Sweats after it.
yune 26, Better; and having no Victuals to
eat, took my Gun, but found myfelf very weak;
however I kill'd a She-Goat, and with much
Difficulty got it Home, and broil'd fome of it,
and eat; I wou'd fain have ftew'd it, and made
fome Broth, but had no Pot.
June 27, The Ague again fo violent, that I
lay a-bed all Day, and neither eat or drank. I
was ready to perifh for Thirft, but fo weak, I had
not Strength to ftand up, or to get myfelf any
Water to drink : Pray'd to G OD again, but was
light-headed, and when I was not, I was fo igno-
rant, that I knew not what to fay; only I lay and
H 3 cry'd,
CryM, terd look ufoa me, Lord pity me, Lord
fdercy ufoa me : I fuppofe I did nothing elfe for
?wo or three Hours, till the Fit wearing off, I fel\
afleep, and did not wake till far in the Night; when
I wak'd, I found myfelf much refrefH'd, but weak,
and exceeding thirfty: However, as I. had no,
Water in my whole Habitation, I was forc'd to*
lie till Morning, and went to fleep again j In this;
jfecond Sleep, 1 had this terrible Dream.
• I thought, that I was fitting on the Ground on
^he Out-ftde of my Wall, where I fat when the
3torm blew after the Earthquake, and that I faw
a Man defcend from a great black Cloud, in a.
brifeiit Flame of Fire;, and light upon the Ground:,
He was all over as bright as a Flatne, fo that I
Could but juft bear; to look towards him; his;
Countenance was mqft inexpreffibly dreadful^
impoffible for words to defcribe; when he ftep'd
upon the Ground with his Feet, I thought the
Earth trembled, juft as it had done before in the
Earthquake, and all the Air look d to my Appre-
henfion, as if it had been fili'd with Flafhes of Fire.
He was no fooner landed upon the Earth, but.
he rriov'd forward towards me, with a long Speat;
<)]; Weapon in his Hand, to kill me ; and when he
came to a riflng Ground, at fome Diftance, he
fpoke to me, or I heard a Voice fo terrible, that
it is impoffible to exprefs the Terror of it; all that
I can fay I underftood was this, Seeing nil theft
"things have not brought tkee to Repentance, new thou.
fha.lt die: At which Words, I thought he lifted up
the Speac that was in his Hand to kill me^
No one, that fhall ever read this Account, "will,
cxpect that I {hould be able to defcribe the Horror*
of my Soul at this terrible Vifion, I ?nean,that even
while it was a Dream, I even dreamed of tlipfe
tior is i^ any arpte polibje
C
the IrapreflloQ that remain'd upon my Mind, when
I awak d, and found it was but a Dream.
I had alas! no divine Knowledge; what I had re-
ceiv'd by thegoodlnftruction of my Father was then
worn out by an uninterrupted Series, for 8 Years, of
feafaring Wickednefs, and a conftant Convention
with nothing but fuch as were like myfelf, wicked
and prophane to the laft Degree: I do not remem-
ber that I had in all that time one Thought that fo
much as tended either to looking upwards toward
God, or inwards towards a Reflection upon my
own Ways: But a certain Stupidity of Soul, with-
out Defire of Good, or Confcience of Evil, had
entirely overwhelm'd me,and I was all that the moft
hardned, unthinking, wicked Creature among our
common Sailors can be fuppos'd to be, not having
the leaft Senfe, either of the Fear of God in Dan-
ger, or of Thankfulnefs to God in Deliverances.
In the relating what is already paft of my Story,
this will be the more eafily believed, when I {hall
'add, that thro' all the Variety of Miferies that
had to this Day befallen me, I never had fo much
as one Thought of it being the Hand of God, or
that it was a juft PunnTiment for my Sin, my re-
bellious Behaviour againft my Father, or my pre-
fent Sins,which were great; or fo much as a Punifh-
ment for the general Conrfe of my wicked Life.
When T was on the defperate Expedition on the
defart Shores of Africa, I never had fo much as one
Thought of what would become of me ; or one
Wifh to God to dired: me whither I fhould go, or
to keep me from the Danger which apparently fur-
rounded me, as well from voracious Creatures as
cruel Savages : But I was meerly thoughtlefs of a
God, or a Providence, acted like a meer Brute
from the Principles of Nature, and by the Dilates
of common Scnfe only, and indeed hardly that.
H 4 When
When I was deliver'd and taken up at Sea by
\hePortugal Captain, well us'd and dealt juftly and
honourably with, as well as charitably, 1 had not
the leait Thankfulnefs on my Thoughts: When
again I was fhipwreck'd, ruin'd, and in danger of
drowning on this Ifland, I was as far from Rc-
morfe, or looking on it as a Judgment • I only fai4
to myfelf often, that I was an unfortunate Dog, and
bora to be always miferable.
It is true, when I. got on Shore firft here, and
found all my Ship's Crew drown'd, and myfelf
fpar'd, I was furpriz'd with a kind of Extafy, and
fome Tranfports of Soul, which, had the Grace of
God aflifted, might have come up to true Thank-
fukiefs ; but it ended where it begun, in a meer
common Flight of Joy, or, as I may fay, being glai
1 TUM alive, without the leaft Reflection upon the
diftinguifhing Goodnefs of the Hand which had,
preferv'd me, and had fingled me out to be pre-
ferv'd, when all the reft were deftroy'd ; or an Enr
quiry why Providence had been thus merciful tp
me j even juft the fame common fort of Joy whicfr
Seamen generally have after they are got fafe afhore
from, a Shipwreck,which they drown all in the next
Bowl of Punch, and forget almoft %> fopn as 't is
over, and all the reft of my Life was like it.
Even, when I was afterwards, on due Confidcr
ration, made fenfible of my Condition, ho.w I was
caft on this dreadful Place, out of the Reach of
human Kind, out of all Hope of Relief, or Profpecx
of Redemption, as foon as I faw but a Profpect of
living, and that I fhould not ftarve and perifh ror
Hunger, all the Senfe of my Affliction wore oft,
and 1 begun to be very eafy, apply'd my felf to th,p
Works proper for my Prefervation and Supply, ana
was far enough from being afflicted at my Con-
dition, as a Judgment from Heaven, or as th,e
Hand
Hand of God againft me ; thefe were Thoughts
which very feldom enter'd into my Head.
The growing up of the Corn, as is hinted in
my Journal, had at firft fome little Influence upon
me, and began to affect me with Serioufnefs, as
Jong as I thought it had fomething miraculous in
it; but as foon as ever that Part of the Thought
was remov'd, all the Impreffion which was rais'd
from it, wore offalfo, as I have noted already.
Even the Earthquake, tho' nothing could be
more terrible in its Nature, or more immediately
directing to the invifible Power, which alone di-
rects fuch things; yet no fooner was the firft Fright
over,but the Impreffion it had made, went offalfo.
I had no more Senfe of God or his Judgments,
much lefs of the prefent Affliction of my Circum-
ftances being from his Hand, than if I had been
in the mpft profperous Condition of Life.
But now when I began to be fick, and a leifure-
ly View of the Miferies of Death came to place
itfelf before me; when my Spirits began to fink
under the Burden of a ftrong Diftemper, and Na-
ture was exhaufted with the Violence of the Fe-
ver ; Confcience that had flept fo long, began to
awake, and I began to reproach myfelf with my
pafl Life, in which I had fo evidently, by uncom-
mon Wickednefs, provok'd the Juftice of God to
lay me under uncommon Strokes, and to deal with
me in fo vindictive a manner,
j • Thefe Reflections opprefs'd me for the fecond or
third Day of my Diftemper, and in the Violence,
as well of th,e Fever, as of the dreadful Reproaches
of my Confcience, extorted fome Words from me,
like praying to Qod, tho' I cannot fay they were
either a Prayer attended with Defires or vyith
Hopes; it was rather the Voice of meer Fright
ant! Diftrefsj my Thoughts were 'confus'd, the
Con vie-
Convi&ions great upon my Mind, artd the Horror
of dying in fuch a miferable Condition, rais'd Va-
pours into my Head with the raeer Apprehen-
fions; and in thefe Hurries of my Soul, I know
not what my Tongue might exprefs ; but it was
rather Exclamation, fuch as, Lord! -what a mife-
rcibk Creature am I? If I fhould be fick, Ijhatt certain*
1y die for want of Help, and -what -will become of me!
Then the Tears burft out of my Eyes, and I
could fay no more for a good while.
In this Interval, the good Advice of my Father
came to my Mind, and prefently his Prediction,
which I mentioned at the Beginning of this Story,
viz. That if I did take this foolijl Step, God would not
llefs me ; and I -would have lei fare hereafter to tifleft
upon having neglected his Counfel, -when there might be
'none to affift in my Recovery. Now, faid I aloud,
my dear Father's Words are come to pafs; God's
Juftice has overtaken me, and I have none to help
or hear me: I rejected the Voice of Providence,
which had mercifully put me in a Pofture or Sta-
tion of Life, wherein I might have been happy and
eafy; but I would neither fee it myfelf, or learn
'to know the Blefling of it from my Parents: I lefr
them to mourn over my Folly, and now I am left
to mourn under the Confequences of Jr. I refus'd
their Help and AfTiftance who would have lifted
me into the World, and wou'd have made every
thing eafy to me, arid now I have Difficulties to
ftruggle with, too great for even Nature itfelf to
fupport, and no Afliftance, no Help, no Comfort,
no Advice: Then I cry'd out, Lord be my Help,
for I am in great Diftreff. '
This was the firft Prayer, if I may call it K>,
that I had made for many Years.^ But I return 10
my Journal.

June 28, Having been fomewhat refrefh^ with
the Sleep I had had,' and the Fit being entirety
Oft, I got up; and tho' the Fright and Terror of
my Dream was very great, yet I confider'd, that
the Fit of the Ague wou'd return again the next
Day, and now was my time to g*et fomething to
refrefh and fupport myfelf when I fhould be ill;
2nd the firft thing I did, I fill'd a large fquare.
Cafe Bottle with Water, and fet it upon my Ta-
ble, in Reach of my Bed; and to take off the chilf
or aguifh Difppfition of the Water, I put about.
a Quarter of a Pint of Rum 'into it, and mixM
them together; then I got me a Piece of the
Goat's Flefh, and broil cl it on the Coals, bufc
could eat very little; I walk'd about, but was ve-:
ry weak, and withal very fad and he^vy-hearted
in the Senfe of my miferable Condition; dreading
the Return of my Diftemper .the next Day;.at
flight I made my Supper of three of the Turtle's
Eggs, which I roafted in the Afhes, and eat, as we
call it, in the Shell; and this was the firft Jlit.of
Meat I had ever ask'd God's Bleffing to, e/ven a^
J cou'd remember in my whole Life.
After I had eaten, I try'd to walk, but found[
myfelf fo weak that I cou'd hardly carry the*
Gun, (for I never went out without that) fo l:
went but a little Way, and fat down upon the
Ground, looking out upon the Sea, which was
juft before me, and very calm and fmooth : As.
1 fat here, feme fuch Thoughts as thefe occur'd
to me.
What is this Earth and Sea of which I have feen.
fo much ? whence is it produced ? and what am I,
and all the other Creatures, wild and tame, hu-
and brutal, whence $re we ?
'
Sure we are all made by fome fecret Power,
who form'd the Earth and Sea, the Air and Sky;
and who is that ?
Then it foiiow'd mofl naturally, It is God'that
has made it all: Well, but then it came on ftrangely,
if God has made all thefe Things, He guides and
governs them all, and all Things that concern
chem; for the Power that could make all Things,
muft certainly have Power to guide and dired
them.
If fo, nothing can happen in the great Circuit of
his Works, either without his Knowledge or Ap-
pointment.
And if nothing happens without hisRnowledge,
He knows that I am here, and am in this dreadful
Condition ; and if nothing happens without his
Appointment, he has appointed aH this to befal
me.
Nothing occurr'd to my Thought to contradict
any of thefe Conclufions ; and therefore it refted
upon me with the greater Force, that it muft needs
be, that God has appointed all this to befal me ;
that I was brought to this miferable Circumftance
by his Direction, he having the fole Power, not of
me only, tut of every thing that happen'd in the
World. Immediately it foiiow'd,
Why has God done this to me ? What haw I done to
le thtu us'd ?
My Conference prefently check'd me in that En-
quiry, as if I had blafphem'd, and methought it
fpoke to me like a Voice} WRETCH! do/l thou
ask -what thou baft done! look back upon a dreadful
mif-fpent Life, and ask thy felf -what thou baft nut
'done ? ask, Why is it that thou wert not long ago de-
ftroy'd ? Why wert tfiou not drown d in Yarmouth
' Roads ? Kili'd in the Fight when the Ship was taken by
?he Salle Man of War ? Devour'd by the wild Beafis
09
t
on the Coaft of Africa ? Or Drown'd HE, R £,
•when all the Crew ferijb'd but thyfelf? Doft thouask
What have I done?.
I was ftruck.dumb with thefe Refle&ions, as one
aftonifh'd, and had not a Word to fay, no not to
ianfwer to myfelf, but rofc up penfive and fad,
walk'd back to my Retreat, arid went up over m/
Wall, as if I had been going to Bed, but my
Thoughts were fadly difturb'd, and I had no In-
clination to fleep ; fo I fat down in my Chair,
and lighted my Lamp, for it began to be dark.
Now as the Apprehenfion of the Return of my Di-
ftemper terrify'd me very much, it occurr'd to my
Thought, that the Brafiltans take no Phyfick but
their Tobacco for almoft all Diftempers ; and I
had a Piece of a Roll of Tobacco in one of the
Chefts, which was quite cur'd, and forrie alfo that
was green and not quite cur'd.
I went, directed by Heaven no doubt; for in
this Cheft I found a Cure both for Soul and Body,
I open'd the Cheft, and found what I look'd for,wi.
the Tobacco ; and as the few Books, I had fav'd,
lay there too, I took out one of the Bibles which
I mention'd before, and which to this Time I had
not found Leifure, or fo much as Inclination to
look into; I fay, I took it out, and brought both
that and the Tobacco with me to the Table.
What Ufe to make of the Tobacco, I knew not,
as to my Diftemper, or whether it was good for it
or no i but I try'd feVeral Experiments with it, as
if I was refolv d it fhould hit one way or other:
1 firft took a Piece of a Leaf, and chew'd it in my
Mouth, which indeed at firft almoft ftupify'd my
Brain, the Tobacco being green and ftrong, and
that I had not been im-ch us'd to it; then ) took
fome and fteep'd it an Hour or two in fome Rum,
aud refolv'd to take a Dofe of it when 1 lay down ;
and
[,110]
and laftjy, I burnt fpme upon a Pan of Coals, and
held my 'Nofe clofe over tfte Smoak Qf it as long
as I could bear it, as well for the Heat as almolL
for Suffocation. ,
In the Interval of this Operation, I took up the t
Bible and began to read, but my Head was too
much difturp'd with the Tobacco to bear reading^ ;
at leaft that time j only having open'd the Book
eafually, the firft Words that occur'd to me were
thefe, CaS on me in the Day of Trouble, and I will de-
liver, qnd tbou fialt glorify me.
The Words were very apt to my Cafe, and made
fonve Impreffion upon my Thoughts at the time of
reading them, tho' not fo much as they did after-
wards i for as for being deliver'd, the Word had no
Soun.d,i# Ini#yf(iy,to me; the thing was fo remote^
fo impoflible in my Apprehenfion of things, that
I began to fay as the Children of Ifrael did, when
they were promis'd Flefh to eat, Can God ffread a.
Talk in the H/ildcrnefs ? fo I began to fay, Can God
himfelf deliver me from this Place? And as it was
rot for many Years that any Hope appear'd, this
prevail'd very often upon my Thoughts: But
however, the Words made a great Impreflion upon
me, and I mufed upon them very often. It grew
now late, and the Tobacco had, as I faid, doz'd
my Head fo much, that I inclin'd to fleep; fo I
left my Lamp burning in the Cave, left I fhould
want any thing in the Night, and went to Bed j
but before I lay down, I did what I never had done
in all my Life, I kneel'd down and pray'd to God
to fulfil the Promife to me, that if I call'd upon him
in the Day of Trouble, he would deliver me:
After my broken and imperfect Prayer was over, I
drunk the Rum in which I had fteep'd the Tobac-"
co, which was fo flrong and rank of the Tobacco,
that indeed I could fcarce get it down; immediately
upon
... • i.
upon this I went to Bed, I found presently it flew
up in my Bead violently, but I fell into a found
Sleep, and wak'd no more, till by the Sun it muft
necefferily be near threes-Clock in the Afternoon,
the next Day;: nay, to this Hour I'm partly of the
Opinion, that I flept all the next Day and Night,
and till almoft three that Day after; for other-
wife I knew not how I fhould lofe a Day out of
my Reckoning in the Days of the Week, as it ap-
pear'd fojue Years after I had done ; for if I had
loft itbycroffing and recroffing the Line, Ilhould
have loft more than one Day: But certainly I loft a
Day in my Account, and never knew which Way.
Be that however one way or t'other, when I
aw^k'd I found myfelf exceedingly refrefh'd, and
my Spirits lively and chearful; when I got up, I
was ftronger than I was the Day before, and my
Stomach better, for I was hungry; and in fhort, I
had no Fit the next Day, but continu'd much al-
ter'd for the better ; this was the zpth.
The joth was my Well-day of Courfe, and I
went abroad with my Gun, but did not care to
travel too far. I kill'd a Sea-Fowl or two, fomer
thing like a Brand-Goofe, and brought them home,
but was not very forward to eat them; fo I eat
fome more of the Turtle's Eggs, which were very
food: This Evening I renew'd theMedicine which
had fuppos'd did me good the day before, -viz.. the
Tobacco fteep'd in Rum, only I did not take fo
much as before, nor did I chew any of the Leaf, or
hold myHead over the Smoke; however, I was not
fo well the next Day, which was the firftof July,
as I hop'd I fhould have been ; for I had a little
Spice of the cold Fit, but it was not much.
July 2, I renew'd the Medicine all the three
Ways, and doz'd my felf .with it as at firft j and
doubled.the Quantity which I drank.
3. I mifs'd the Fit for good and all, tho* I did
hot recover my full Strength for fome Weeks after;
While I was thus gathering Strength, myThoughts
run exceedingly upon this Scripture, / witt deliver
ithee; and the Impofflbility of my Deliverance lay
much upon my Mind in Bar of my ever expefting
it. But as I was difcouraging myfelf with fuch
Thoughts, it occurr'd to my Mind, that I pored
fo much upon my Deliverance from the main Affli-
ction, that I difregarded the Deliverance I had re^
ceiv'd ; and I was, as it were, made to ask my
felf fuch Queftions as rhefe, viz,. Have I not been
deliver'd,and wonderfully too, fromSicknefs; from
the moft diftrefled Condition that could be, and
that was fo frightful to me, and what Notice I
had taken of it ? Had I done my part, God had de-
livered me; but I had not glorified him ; that is to fay,
I had not own'd and been thankful for that as a
Deliverance, and how could I exped greater De^
liverance?
This touch'd my Heart very much, and imme-
diately I kneel'd down, and gave God Thanks &-
loud for my Recovery from my Sicknefs.
July 4, In the Morning 1 took the Bible, and be^
ginning at the New Teftament, I began ferioufly
to read it, and impos'd upon myfelf to read a-
while every Morning and every Night, not tying
myfelf to the Number of Chapters, but as long as
my Thoughts fhould engage me: It was not long
after I fet ferioufly to this Work, but I found
my Heart more deeply and fincerely affefted with
the Wickednefs of my paft Life : The Im>
preflion of my Dream reviv'd, and the Words, AS
thefe things have not brought thee to Repentance, ran fe-
rionfly in my Thought: I was earneftly begging
of God to give me Repentance, when it happen'd
providentially the very Day that reading the Scrip-
. ture,
t.113 ]
ture, I cartie to thefe Words, He is exalted a Prince
'and a SaViour, to give Repentance, attd to gitie Remif-
<fion: I threw down the Book, and with my Heart
as well as my Hands lifted up to Heaven, in a
Kind of Extafy of Joy; I cry'd out aloud, Jeftfa,
thou Son of David, Jefa*, t'bou exalted Prince and. Sa-
viour, giise me Repentance !
This was the firft time that I could .fayj in the
true Senfe of the Words, that I pray'd iti all my
Life; for now I pray'd with a Senfe of my Con-
dition, and with a true Scripture View of Hope
founded on the Encouragement of the Word of
God 5 and from this Time, I may fay, I began to
have Hope that God would hear me.
Now I began to conftrue the Words mentibned
.above, Call on me, and I "xiU deliver you, in a diffe-
rent Senfe from what I had ever done before ; for
then I had no Notion of any thing being call'd De-
liverance, but my being deliver'd from the Capti-
vity I was in ; for tho' I was indeed at large in
the Piacei yet the Ifland was certainly a Prifon to*
jrnc, and that in the worft Senfe in the World?
but now I learn'd to take it in another Senfe:
Now I look'd back upon my paft Life with fucH
Horror, and my Sins appear'd fo dreadful, that
my Soul fought nothing of God, but Deliverance
from the Load of Guilt that bore down all my
Comfort: As for my folitary Life it was nothing ;
I did not fo much as pray to be deliver'd from it,
Or think 6f it ; it was 'all of no Confideratioh in
comparifon to this ; and I add this Part here, to
hint to whoever {hall read it, fhat whenever they
come to a true Senfe of things, they will find De-
liverance from Sin a much greater Biefling thanDe-
Jiverance from Affliction.
BHC leaving this Part, I return to my Journal,
My Condition began now to be, tho' not left
mifcrable as to my Way of living, yet much eafier
to my Mind; and my Thoughts being directed by
a conftant reading the Scripture, and praying to
God, to things of a higher Nature ; 1 had a great
deal of Cemfort within, which till now I knew
nothing of; alfo as my Health and Strength re-
turned, I beftir'd myfelf to furnifh myfelf with eve-
ry thing that I wanted, and make my way of liv-
ing as regular as i could.
From the 4th of July to the i4th, I was chiefly
employ'd in walking about with my Gun in my
Hand, a little and a little at a Time, as a Man
that was gathering up his Strength after a Fit of
Sicknefs: For it is hardly to be imagin'd, how low
I was, and to what Weaknefs I was reduc'd. The
Application which I made ufe of was perfectly
new, and perhaps what had never cur'd an Ague
before, neither can I recommend it to any one to
pra&ife, by this Experiment; and tho' it did car-
ry off the Fit, yet it rather contributed to weaken-
. ing me ; for I had frequent Convulfions in my
Nerves and Limbs for fome time.
I learnt from it alfo this in particular, that be-
ing abroad in the rainy Seafon was the moft perni-
cious thing to my Health that could be, efpecially
in thofe Rains which came attended with Storms
and Hurricanes of Wind • for as the Rain which
' came in a dry Seafon was always moft accompa-
ny'd with fuch Storms, fo I found that Rain was
much more dangerous than the Rain which fell in
September and O&ober.
I had been now in this unhappy Ifland above 10
Months, all Pofllbility of Deliverance from this
Condition feem'd to be entirely taken from me ;
and I firmly believed, that no humane Shape had.
ever fet Foot upon that Place : Having now fecur'd
my
t ii5 3.
tny Habitation, as 1 thought, fully tb my Mind, 1
had a great Defire to make a more perfect Difco-
very of the Ifland, and to fee what other Produc-
tions I might find, which I yet knew nothing
of.
It was the i5th of July that I began to take a
more particular Survey of the Ifland it fclf : I went
up the Creek firft, where, as I hinted, I brought
my Raits on Shore; I found after I came about
two Miles up, that the Tide did not flow any
higher, and that it was no more than a little
Brook of running Water, and very frefh and good j
but this being the dry Seafon, there was hardly any
Water in feme Parts of it, at leaft not enough to
run in any Stream, fo as it could be perceiv'd.
On the Bank of this Brook I found many plea-
• fant Savana's, or Meadows, plain, fmooth, and •
cover'd with Grafs,- and on the rifing Parts of
them next to the higher Grounds, where the Wa-
ter, as it might be fuppofed, never overflow'd,
I found a great deal of Tobacco, green, and growing
to a great and very flrong Stalk : There were divers
other Plants which I had no Notion of, or tJnder-
ftanding about, and might perhaps have Virtues
of their own, which I could not find out.
I fearched for the Cajfavct Root, which the In-
dians in all that Climate make their Bread of, but I
could find none. I faw large Plants of Aloes, but
did not then underftand them. I faw feveral Sugar;
Canes, but wild, and for want of Cultivation, iffl-'"
perfect. I contented rhyfelf with thefe Difcoveries
for this time, and came back mufing xvith ray
felf \frhat Courfe I might take to know the Virtue
and Goodnefs of any of the Fruits or Plants which.
I {hotdd difcover ; but could bring it to no Con-
clufion ; for in fhort, I had made fo little Obfer-
vatiori while I was in the Bra/th, that I knew little'
f II*']
of the Plants in the Field, at leaft very little that
might ferve me to any Purpofe now in my Di-
ftrefs.
The next Day, the itfth, I went up the fame
Way again, and after going fomething farther than
I had gone the Day before, I found the Brook, and
the Savanas began to ceafe, and the Country be-
came more woody than before: in this Part I found
different Fruits, and particularly I found Melons
upon the Ground in great Abundance, and Grapes
upon the Trees; the Vines had fpread indeed over
the Trees, and the Clufters of Grapes were juft
now in their Prime, very ripe and rich : This was a
furprifing Difcovery, and I was exceeding glad of
them; but I was warn'd by my Experience to eat
fparingly of them, remembring, that when I was
afhore in Barbary, the eating of Grapes kill'd feve-
ral of our Englijh Men who were Slaves there, by
throwing them into Fluxes and Fevers : But I
found an excellent Ufe for thefe Grapes, and that
was to cure OB dry them in the Sun, and keep them
as dry'd Grapes or Raifins are kept, which I
thought would be, as indeed they were, as whole-
fome, as agreeable to eat, when no Grapes might
be to be had.
I fpent all that Evening there, and went not
back to my Habitation, which by the way was
the firft Night, as I might fay, I had lain from
Home. In the Night I took my firft Contrivance,
and got up into a Tree, where I flept well, and the
next Morning proceeded upon my Difcovery, tra-
velling near four Miles, as I might judge by the
Length of the Valley, keeping ftill dae North, with
a Ridge of Hills on the South and North fide of
me.
At the End of this March I came to an Open-
ing, where the Country feem'd to defcend to the
Weft,
C 117 1
Weft, and a little Spring of freffi Water, which if-
fued out of the Side of the Hill by me, run the
other way, that is due Eaft ; and the Country ap-
pear'd fo frefh, fo green, foflourifhing, every thing
being in a conftant Verdure, or Flourifh ok'Spring,
that it it look'd like a planted Garden.
I defcended a little on the Side of that delicious
Vale, Purveying it with a fecret Kind of Pleafure,
(tho' mixt with my other afflicting Thoughts) to
think that this was all my own, that I was King
and Lord of all this Country indefeafibly, and had
a Right of Pofleffion ; and if I could convey it,
I might have it in Inheritance, as .compleatly as
any Lord of a Manor in England. I faw here
Abundance of Cocoa Trees, Orange, and Le-
mon, and Citron Trees ; but all wild, and very
few bearing any Fruit, at leaft not then : How-
ever, the green Limes that I gathered, were not
only pleafant to eat, but very wholefome ; and I
mix'd their Juice afterwards with Water, which
made it very wholefome, and very cool, and re-
fijefhing.
I found now I had Bufinefs enough to gather and
^arry Home; and I refolv'd to lay up a Store, as
well of Grapes, as Limes and Lemons, to furnifh
myfelf for the wet Seafon, which I knew was ap-
proaching.
In order to this, I gather'd a great Heap of
Grapes' in one Place, and a lefler Heap in another
Place, and a great Parcel of Limes and Lemons in
another Place ; and taking a few of each with me,
I travel'd homeward, and refolv'd to come again,
and bring a Bag or Sack, or what I could make, to
carry the reft Home.
Accordingly, having fpent three Days in this
Journey, I came Home, fo I muft now call my
Tent and my Cave: But before I got thither, the
I 3 Grapes
Grapes were fpoil'd, the Richnefs of the Fruits,
and the Weight of the Juice having broken them,
and bruis'd them, they were good tor little or no-
ching ; as to the Limes, they were good, but I
could bting but a few.
The next Day, being the ipth, I went back,
having made me two fmall Bags to bring Home
my Harveii : But I was lurpriz'd, when coming
to my Heap ot Grapes, which were fo rich and
fine when 1 gather'd them, I found them all fpread
about, trod to pieces, and drag'd about, fome
here, fome there, and Abundance eaten and de->
vourM: By thi§ I concluded, there were fome wild
Creatures thereabouts, which had done this j but
what they were I knew not.
However, as I found that there was no laying
them up on Heaps, and no carrying them away in
a Sack, but that one way they would be deftroy'd,
and the other way they would be crufh'd with
their own Weight; I took another Courfe; for I
gather'd a large Quantity of the Grapes, and hung
them up upon the out Branches of the Trees, that
they might cure and dry in the Sun j and as for .
the Limes and Lemons, I carry'das many back as.
J could well ftand under.
When I came Home from this Journey, I con-
templated with great Pleafure the Fruitfulnefs of
that Valley, and the Pleafantnefs of the Situation,
the Security from Storms on that Side the Water,.
and the Wood, and concluded, that I had pitch'd
upon a Place to fix my Abode, which was by fat
fhe worft Part of the Country. Upon the whole
I began to confider of removing my Habitation ;
and to look out for a Place equally fafe, as where
I now was fituate, if poffible, in that pkafant
frHitfulPartQfthe.Iflan&
This
This Thought run long in my Head, ahdlwas
exceeding fond of it for fome Tim», the Pieafant-
nefs of the Place tempting me; but when I came
to a nearer View of it, and to confider that I was
now by the Sea-fide, where it was at leaft polfible"
that fomething might happen to my Advantage,
and by 'the fame ill Fate that brought me hither,
might bring fome other unhappy Wretches to the
fame Place; and tho'.it was fcarce probable that
any fuch thing fhould ever happen, yet to enclofe
myfelf among the Hills and Woods, in the Center
of the Ifland, was to anticipate my Bondage, and
to render fuch an Affair not only improbable, but
impoffible ; and that therefore I ought not by any
Means to remove.
However, I was fo enamour'd of this Place,"
that I fpent much of my Time therefor the whole
remaining Part of the Month of 'July ; and tho'
upon fecond Thoughts I refolv'd as above, not to
remove, yet I built me a little kind of a Bower,
and furrounded it at a Pittance with a ftrong
Fence, being a double Hedge, as high as I could
reach, well ftak'd, and fill'd between with Brujh-.
-wood; and here I lay very fecure, fometimes two '
or three Nights together, always going over it
with a Ladder, as before; fo that I fancy'd now I
had my Country-Hoiife, and my Sea-Coaft-Hoafe:
And this Work took me up to the Beginning of
Auguft.'
I had but newly finifii'd my Fence, and began
to enjoy my Labour, but the Rains came on, and
made me ftickclofeto myfii.ftHabitation; for tho'
1 had made me"a Tent like the other, with a Piece
of a Sail, and fpread it very well; yet I had not;
the Shelter of a Hill to keep me from Storms, nor a
Cave behind me to retreat into, when the Rains
were extraordinary.
I 4 About
About the Beginning of Auguft, at I fad, \ had
finifh'd my Eower, and began to enjoy myfelf.
The third of Auguft, I found the Grapes I had
hung up were perfectly dry'd, and indeed, were
excellent good Raifins of the Sun ; fo I began to,
take them down from the Trees, and it was very
happy that I did fo ; for the Rains which follow'd
would have fppil'd them, and I had loll the beft
Part of my Winter Food ; for I had above two,
hundred large Bunches of them. No fooner had
I taken them ail down and qarry'd moft of them
Home to my Cave, but it began to rain ; and from
hence, which was the fourteenth of Auguft, itrain'd
more or lefs, every Day, till the middle of Qllober ;
and fometimes fo violently, that I could not ftir
out of my Cave for feveral Days.
In this Seafon I was much furpriz'd with th$ ,
Increase of my Family : I had been concern'd for
the Lofs of one of my Cats, \vho run away from
me, or at I thought had been dead, and I heard no
more Tale or Tidings of her, till to my Aftonifh-
ment fhe came home about the End of Augitft,
with three 'Kittens. This was the more ftrange to
mz, becaufe thb' I had kill'd a wild Cat, as J
call'd it, with my Gun j yet I thought it was a,
quite differing Kind frpm our European Cats; yet
the young Cats were the fame kind pf Houfe-
breed like the old onej and both my Gats being
Females, I thought it very ftrange: But frorrf thefe.
three Cats, I afterwards came to be fo pefter d
with Cats, that I was fprc'd to kiil them likeVer-
min, or wild Beafls, and to drive them fr,om rojr,
Houfe as much as ppffible.
From the fourteenth of^w^tp the twenty.
fixth, inceffant Rain, fo that I could not ftir, and
was now very careful not to be much wet. In this
Confinement I began to be ftraitn^dl for Food, but
venturing
venturing out twice, I one Day kill'd a Goat, and
the laft Day, which was the twenty-fixth, found
a very large Tortoife, which was a Treat to me,
and ray Food was regulated thus; I eat a Bunch
of Raifins for my Breakfaft, a Piece of the Goat's
Flefh, or of the Turtle for my Dinner broil'd ;
for to my great Misfortune, 1 had no Veflel to
boil or flew any thing; and two or three of the
Turtle's Eggs for my Supper.
During this Confinement in my Cover by the
Rain, 1 work'd daily two or three Hours at en*
}arging my Cave, and by Degrees work'd it on
towards one Side, till I came to the Outfide of the
Hill, and made a Door or Way out, which came
beyond my Fence or Wall, and fo I came in and
out this Way : but I was not perfectly eafy at
lying fo open; for as I had manag'd myfelf be-
fore, 1 was in a perfect Enclofure, whereas now I
thought 1 lay expos.d, and open for any thing to
come in upon me; and yet 1 could not perceive
that there was any living thing to fear, the big-
geft Creature that 1 had >et feen upon the Ifland
being a Goat.
September the thirtieth, I was now come to the
unhappy Anniverfary of my Landing. I caft up the
Notches on my Poft, and found 1 had been on
Shore three hundred and fixty five Days. I kept
this Day as a folemn Faft, fetting it apart to Re-
ligious Exercife, proftrating myfelf on the Ground
with the moft ferious Humiliation, confefling my
Sins to God, acknowledging his righteous Judg-
ments upon me, and praying to him to have Mer-
cy on me, thro' Jefus Chrift; and having noc
tafted the leaft Refrefhment for twelve Hours,
even till the going down of the Sun, I then eat a
Bisket-Cake, and a Bunch of Grapes, and went to
Bed, finishing thtf Day as I began, it.
I M
I had all this time obferv'd no Sabbath-Day;
for as at firft 1 had no Senfe of Religion upon my
Mind, 1 had atter fome time omitted to diftm-
guifh the Weeks, by making a longer Notch than
ordinary for the Sabbath-Day, and fo did not really
kr.ow what any of the Days were; but now hav-
ing caft up the Days, as above, I found I had been
there a Year; fo 1 divided it into Weeks, and fet
apart every feventh Day for a Sabbath; tho' I
found at the End of my Account 1 had loft a Day
or two in my Reckoning.
A little after this my Ink began to fail me, *nd
fo 1 contented myfelf to ufe it more fparingiy, and
to write down only the moil remarkable Events of
my Life, without continuing a daily Memorandum
of other things.
The rainy Seafon, and the dry Seafon, began now
to appear regular to me, and 1 learnt to divide
them fo, as to provide for them 'accordingly. But
I bought all my Experience before I had it; and
this 1 am going tb relate, was one of the moft dif-
couraging Experiments that I made at all: I have
mention'd that I had fav'd the few Ears of Barley
and Rice which I had fo furprizingly found fpring
up, as i thought, of themfelves, and belfeve there
were about thirty Stalks of Rice, and about twen-
ty of Barley; and now I thought it a proper time
to fow it after the Rains, the Sun J^ing in its
Southern Pofition going from me. w+
Accordingly I dug up a Piece of Ground, as
well as I could with my wooden Spade, and di-
viding it into two Parts, I fow'd my Grain; but •
as I was fowing, it cafually occur^ko my Thoughts,
that I would not fow it all at firft, becaufe 1 did
not know when was the proper time for it; fp I
fow'd about two thirds of the Seed, leaving about
a handful of each.
It was a great Comfort to me afterwards, tha$.
1 did fo, for not one Grain of that 1 fow'd this
time came to any thing; for the dry Months
following, the Earth having had no Rain after
the Seed was fown, it had no Moifture to affift
its Growth, and never came up at all, till the
wet Seafon had come again, and then it grew as
if it had been but newly fown.
Finding my firft Seed did not grow, which I
eafily imagin'd was by the Drought, i fought for
a moifter Piece of Ground to make another Ttial
in, and I dug up a Piece of Ground near my new
Bower, and fow'd the reft of my Seed iri February^
a little before the Vernal Equinox; and this having
the rainy Months of March and April to water it,
fprung up very pleafantly, and yielded a very good
Crop; but having Part of the Seed left only, and
not daring to fbw all that I had, 1 had but a fmall
Quantity at laft, my whole Crop not amounting
to above half a Peck of each kind. ,
But by thjs Experiment I was made Mailer of
my Bunj^fs, and knew exactly when the proper
Seafon fFas to fow; and that i might expect two
Seed-tiyfes, and two Harvefts every Year.
While this Corn was growing, I made a little
Difcovery .which was of life to me afterwards :
Asfoon as the Rains were over, and the Weather
began to fettle, which was about the Month of
November, I made a Vifit up the Country to my
Bower, where tho' I had not been fome Months,
yet I found all things juft as I left them. The Cir-
cle or double Hedge that I had made, was not on-
ly firm and entire, 'but the Stakes which 1 had cut
out of fome Trees that grew thereabouts, were all
fhot out and grown with long Branches, as much
as a Willow-tree ufuaily fhoots the firft Year after
Japping its Head, J could uor tell what Tree to
call
dall it, ^ that thefe Stakes were cut from. I was
furpriz'd, and yet very well pleas 'd, to fee the
young Trees grow ; and I prun'd them, and led
them up to grow as much alike as I could ; and
it is fcarce credible how beautiful a Figure they
grew into in three Years; fo that tho" the
Hedge made a Circle of about twenty five Yards
in Diameter, yet the Trees, for fuch I might
now call them, foon cover'd it ; and it was a
compleat Shade, fufficient to lodge under all the
dry Seafon.
This made me refolve to cut fome more Stakes,
and make me a Hedge like this in a Semicircle
round my Wall ; I mean that of my firft Dwelling,
which I did; and placing the Trees or Stakes in
a double Row, at about eight Yards diftance from
my firft Fence, they grew prefently, and were at
firft a fine Cover to my Habitation, and afterward
ferv'd for a Defence alfo, as I fhall obferve in its
Order.
I found now, that the Seafons of the Year
might generally be divided, not into Summer and
Winter, as in Europe; but into the rainy Seafons,
and the dry Seafons, which were generally thus :
Rainy, the Sun being then on, or
near the ****»*'
 Dry, the Sun being then to the,
North Of the Line.

The Rainy Seafon fometimes held longer or
fhorter, as the Winds happen'd to blow ; but this
was the general Obfervation I made : After I had
found, by Experience, the ill Confequence of being
abroad in the Rain, I took care to furnifh myfelf
with Provifions before-hand, that I might not be
oblig'd to go out ; and I fat within Doors as much
as poflible during the wet Months.
In this Time I found much Employment, (and
very fuitable alfo to the Time) for I found great
Occafion of many things which I had no way to
furnifh myfelf with, but by hard Labour and con-
ftant Application ; particularly, I try'd many Ways
to make myfelf a Basket, but all the Twigs I
could get for the Purpofe prov'd fo brittle, that
they would do nothing. It prov'd of excellent Ad-
vantage to me now, that when I was a^Boy, I
ufed to take great Delight in Handing at a Basket-
maker's in the Town where my Father liv'd, to
fee them make their IViakey-ware ; and. being, as
Boys ufually are, very officious to help, and a
great Obferver of the Manner how they work'd
thofe things, and fometimes lending a Hand, I
had by this means full Knowledge of the Methods
of it, that I wanted nothing but the Materials ;
when it came into my Mind, that the Twigs of
that Tree from whence I cut my Stakes that grew,
might
might poffibly be as tough as the Sd&otos, and
Wil/o-ws, and Often in England, and I refolv'd
to try.
Accordingly the next Day I went to my Coun-
try-Houfe, as I call'd it, and cutting fome of the
fmaller Twigs, I found them to my Purpofe as
lnuch as I could defire; whereupon I came the next.
time prepar'd with a Hatchet to ait down a
Quantity, which I foon found, for there was great
Plenty of them : thefe I fet up to dry within my
Circle or Hedge, and when they were fit for Ufe,
I carried them to my Cave ; and here during the
next Seafon, I employ'd myfelf in making, as well
CK I could, a great many Baskets, both to carry
Earth, or to carry or lay up/any thing as I had oc-
cafion; and tho' I did not finifh them very hand-
fomly, yet I made them fufficiently ferviceable for
my Purpofe ; and thus afterwards I took care ne-
ver to be without them • and as my Wicker. ware
decay'd, 1 made more, efpecially I made ftrong
deep Baskets to place my Corn in, inftead of Sacks,
when I fhould come to have any Quantity of it.
Having mafter'd this Difficulty, and employ 'A
ft world of Time about it, I beftir'd myfelf ro fee
if poffible, how to fupply two Wants : I had no
Veflels to hold any thing that was Liquid, ex-
cept two Runlets which were almoft full of Rum,
and fome Glafs Bottles, fgrne of the common Size,
and others which were Cafe-Bottles fquare, for1
the holding of Waters, Spirits, &c. I had not fo
much as a Pot to boil any thing, except a great
Kettle which I fav'd out of the Ship, and which
^as too big for fuch Ufe as I defir'd it, viz;, to
make Broth, and ftew a Bit of Meat by itfelfv,
The fecond thing I would fain have'had, was 3
Tobacco-Pipe; but it was fmpoffible to me to
make
make one; however I found a Contrivance for
that too at laft.
1 employ'd myfelf in planting my fecond Rows
of Stakes or Piles, and in this Wicker working ail
the Summer, or dry Sealbn, when another Bufi-
nefs took me up more Time than it could be ima-
.gin'd I could fpare.
I mention'd before, that I had a great Mind to
fee the whole Ifland, and that I had travell'd up
the Brook, and fo on to where I built my Bower,
and where I had an Opening quite to the Sea on
the other Side of the Ifland•• I now refolv'd to
travel quite crofs to the Sea-fhore on that Side:
fo taking my Gun, a Hatofaet, and my Dog, and
a larger Quantity of Powder and Shot than ufual,
with two Bisket-Cakes, and a great Bunch of
Raifins in my Pouch for my Store, I began my
Journey ; when i had pafs'd the Vale where my
Bower flood, as above, I came within View of
the Sea, to the Weft, and it being a very clear Day,
1 fairly defcry'd Land, whether an Ifland or a Con-
tinent, I could not tell; but it lay very high, ex-
tending from the Weft to the IV. S. W. at a very
great Diftance ; by my Guefs it could not be lefs
than fifteen or twenty Leagues off.
1 could not tell what Part of the World this
might be, otherwife than that I know it muft be
Par! of America ; and as I concluded by all my
Obfervations, muft be near the Spanijh Dominions,
and perhaps was all inhibited by Savages, where
ifvi.fhould have landed, I had been in a worfe
Condition than I was now; and therefore I ac-
quiefced in the Difpofitions of Providence, which
I began now to own, and to believe, order'd eve-
ry thing for the beft ; I fay, 1 quieted my Mind
with this, and left afflicting myfelf with fruitlefs
Wifhes of being there.
EeSdes
Beficks, after fome Paufe upon this Affair, t
confider'd, that if this Land was the Sfanijh Coaftj
I fhould certainly, one Time or Other, fee fome
Veflel pafs or re-pafs one Way or other ; but if nork
then it was the Savage Coaft between the Sfanijh
Country and Brafih> which were indeed the worft
of Savages; for they are Cannibals, Of Men-eaters,
and fail not to murther and devour all the humane
Bodies that fall into their Hands.
With thefe Considerations I walk'd very leifurc-
ly forward. I found that Side of the Ifland where
I now was, much pleafanter than mine, the open
or Savana Fields fweet, adorn'd with Flowers and
Grafs, and full of very,fine Woods. I faw Abun-
dance of Parrots, and fain I would have caught one^
if poffible, to have kept it to be tame, and taught
it to fpeak to me. I did, after fome PainS taking;
catch a young Parrot, for I knock'd it down with
a Stick, and having recover'd it, I brought it home;
but it was fome Years before I could make him
fpeak : However, at laft I taught him to call me
by my Name very familiarly : But the Accident
that follow'd, tho' it be a Trifle, will be very di-
verting in its Place.
I was exceedingly diverted with this Journey: I
found in the low Grounds Hares, as I thought
them to be, and Foxes, but they differ'd greatly
from all the other Kinds I had met with; nor could
.1 fatisfy myfelf to eat them, tho' I kill'd feveral :
But I had no need to be venturous ; for I had no
Want of Food, and of that which was very good
too ; efpecially thefe three Sorts, viz.. Goats, Pid*
geons, and Turtle or Tortoife; which, added to my
Granes, Lea Jen-hall Market could not have fur-
nifh'd a Table better than I, in Proportion torhev
Company; and tho' my Cafe was deplorable
enough, yet I had great Caufe for Thankfulnefs.
ana
that I was not driven to any Extremities for food;
but rather Plenty, even to Dainties.
I never travel'd in this Journey above two Miles
outright in a. Day, or thereabouts; but I took fd
many Turns and Returns to fee what Difcoveries
I could maks^hat I came weary enough to the
Place whereVrefolved to fit down for all Night;
and then 1 either repos'd myfelf in a Tree, or fur-
rounded myfelf with a Row of Stakes fet upright
in the Ground, either frdm one Tree to another,
Or fo as no wild Creature could come at me, with-
out waking me.
As foon as I came to the Sea-fhore, I was "fur-
prized to fee that I had taken up my Lot on the
worfl fide of the Ifland; for here indeed the Shore
was cover'd with innumerable Turtles? whereas
on the other fide I had found but three in a Year.
and half. Here was alfo an infinite number of"
Fowls, of many Kinds, fome which I had feen, and
fome which i had not feen of before, and many of
them very good Meat; but fuch as I knew not
the Names of; except thofe call'd Penguins.
I could have fhot as many as I pleas'd, but was
very fparing of my Powder and Shot; and there-
fore had more Mind to kill a She-Goat, if I could,
which I could better feed on: and tho' there
were many Goats here more than on my Side the
Ifland, yet it was with much more Difficulty that .
I could come near them, the Country being flat
and even, and they faw me much fooher than
when I was on the Hill.
I confefs this Side of the Country was much
pleafanter than mine, but yet I had not the l£aft Fn- ,
clination to remove; for as I .was fix'd in my Ha-
bitation, it became natural to me, and I feem'd all
the while I was here, to be..s it were upon a Jour-
her, and from Home: However, I travel'd along
K th*
the Shore of the Sea, towards the Eaft, I fuppofc
about. twelve Miles j and then fetting up a great
tole upon the Shore for a Mark, I concluded I
would go Home again; and that the next Journey
I took Ihould be on the other Side of the ifland,
Eaft from my Dwelling, and fo roimd till I came
to my Poft again : Of which in iOTPlace.
I took another Way to come back than that I
went, thinking I could eafily keep all the Ifland fo
much in my View, that I could not mifs finding
my firfl Dwelling by viewing the Country; but I
found myfelf miftaken; for being come about two
or three Miles, I found myfelf defcended into a
very large Valley; but fo furrounded with Hills,
and thofe Hills covered with Wood, that I could
not fee which was my Way by any Direction but
that of the Sun, nor even then, unlefs I knew very
well the Polition of the Sun at that time of the
Day.
It happen'd, to my farther Misfortune, that
.the Weather prov'd hazey for three or four Days,
while I was in this Valley; and not being able to
fee the Sun, I wander'd about very uncomfortably,
and at laft was obliged to find out the Sea-fide,
Jook for my Poft, and come back the fame Way
J went; and then by eafy Journeys I turn'd home-
ward, the Weather being exceeding hot, and my
Gun, Ammunition, Hatchet, and other things
very heavy.
In this journey my Dog furpriz'd a young Kid,
and feiz'd upon it, and I running in to take ^old
of it, caught it, and fav'd it alive from the Dog :
I had a great mind to bring it Home if I could ;
for I had often been mufing, whether it might not
be pofllb'e to get a Kid or two, and fo raife a
Breed of tame Goats, which might fupply me when
my Powder and Shot fhould be ail fpent.
'"
MJt I
I made a Collar to this little Creature, and with
a String which I made or fome Rope-Yarn which
I always carry'd about me, I led him alongj tho*
with fome Difficulty, till I came to my Bower,
and there I enclos'd him, and left him; tor I was
Very impatient to be at Home, from whence I had
been abfent above a Month.
I cannot exprefs what a Satisfa&ion it was to
me, to come into my old Hutchj and lie down in
my Hamock-Bed : This little wandring Journeyi
without fettled Place of Abode, had been fo un-
pleafant to me, that my own Houfe* as I call'd it
to myfelf, was a perfect Settlement to me, com-
par'd to that; and it render'd every thing about
toe fo comfortable, that I refolv'd I would never
go a great Way from it again, while it fhould be
my Lot to ftay on the Ifland.
I repos'd myfelf here a Week, to reft and regale
myfelf after my long Journey; during which, moft
of the Time was taken up in the weighty Affair of
making a Cage for my Po.l, who began now to be
a meer Domeftick, and to be mighty well acquain-
ted with me. Then I began to think of the poor
Kid, which I had penn'd in within my little Cir-
cle, and refolv'd to go and fetch it Home, or giv£
it fome Food ; accordingly I went, and found it
where I left it; for indeed it could not get 6ut*
but almoft ftarv'd for want of Food : I went and
cut Bows of Trees, and Branches of fuch Shrubs
as I co'ild.find, and threw it over, and having fed
it, I ty'd it as I did before, to lead it away; but
it was fo tame with being hungry, that I had nd
need to have ty'd it; for it follow'd me like d
Dog ; and as I continually fed it, the Creature be*
came fo loving, fo gentle, and fo fond, that it be-
came from that time one of my Domeftkks alfo,
and would never leave me afterwards,
K a Th«
The rainy Scafon of the Autumnal Equinox was
now come, and 1 kept the 3oth of September in the
fame folemn manner as before, being the Anniver-
fary of my Landing on the Jfland, having now been
there two Years, and no more Profpect of being de-
liver'd than the firft Day I came there. 1 fpent the
whole Day in humble and thankful Acknowledg-
ments of the many wonderful Mercies which my fo-
litary Condition was attended with, and without
which it might have been infinitely more miferable.
I gave humble and hearty Thanks that God had
been pleafed to difcover to me, even that it was
poffible I might be more happy in this folitary
Condition, than I fhould have been in a Liberty of
Society, and in all the Pieafures of the World. That
He could fully make up to me the Deficiencies of
my folitary State, and the want of Humane So-
ciety, by his Prefence, and the Communications of
his Grace to my Soul, fupporting, comforting, and
encouraging me to depend upon his Providence
here, and hope for his Eternal Prefence hereafter.
It was now that I began fenfibly to feel how
much more happy this Life 1 now led was, with
all its miferable Circumftances, than the wicked,
curfed, abominable Life .1 led all the paft part of
my Days; and now I changed both my Sorrows
and my Joys; my very Defires alter'd, my Affe-
ctions changed their Gufts, and my Delights were
perfectly new, from what they were at my firft
coming, or indeed for the two Years paft.
• Before, as I walk'd about, either on my Hunt-
ing, or for viewing the Country, the Anguifh of
my Soul at my Condition, would break out upon
me on a fudden, and my very Heart would die
within me, to think.of the Woods, the Mountains,
the Defarts I was in ; and how I was a Prifoner
lock'd up with the Eternal Bars and Bolts of the
Ocean,
c.'?3]
Ocean, in an uninhabited Wildernefs, without Re-
demption : "In the midft of the greateft Compofbres
of my Mind, this would break out upon me like a
Storm, and make me wring my Hands, and weep
like a Child: Sometimes it would take me in the
middle of my Work, arid I would immediately fit
down and figh, and look upon the Ground for an
Hour or two together; and this was ftill worfe to
me ; for if i could burft out into Tears, or vent
. myfelf by Words, it would go off, and the Grief
having exhaufted itfelf, would abate. ^
But now I began to exercife myfelf with new
Thoughts; I daily read the Word of God, and ap-
ply'd all the Comforts of it to my prefent State.
One Morning being very fad, I open'd the Bible
upon thefe Words, 7 -will never, never leave thee, nor
Jorfake tbee; immediately it occur'd, that tliefe
Words were to me, why elfe fhould they be di-
rected in fuch a Manner, juft at the Moment when
I was mourning -over my Condition, as one tbr-
faken of God and Man ? Well then, faid I, .if
God does not forfake me, of what ill Confequence
can it be, or what matters it, tho' the World
fhould all forfake me, feeing on the other hand, if
I had all the World, and fhould lofe the Favour.
and Blefling of God, there wou'd be no Compa-
rifon in the Lofs.
From this Moment I began to conclude in my
Mind, that it was poflible for me to be more
happy in this forfaken folitary Condition, th n it
was probable I fhould ever have been in any other
particular State in the Worid ; and with -this
Thought I was going to give Thanks to God for
bringing me to this Place.
I know not what it was, but fomething fhock'd
my Mind at that Thought, and I durft not fr-eak
the Words: How canft thou'be fuch a Hypo.rite,
K 3 (faid
(faid I, even audibly,) to pretend to be thankful for
n Condition, which however thou may'fl endea-
vour to be contented with, thou would'ft rather
pray heartily to be deliver'd from; fo I ftopp'd
there : But tho' 1 could not fay, I thank'd God
for being there 5 yet I fhicerely gave Thanks* to
God for opening my Eyes, by whatever afflicting
Providences, to fee the former Condition of my
Life, and to mourn for my Wickednefs, and repent,
I never open'd the Bible, or fhut it, but my very
Soul within me blefs'd God for directing my Friend
in England, without any Order of mine, to pack it
up among my Goods; and for aflifting me after-
wards to fave it out of the Wreck of the Ship.
Thus, and in this Difpofition of Mind, I began
my third Year: and tho' 1 have not given the Rea-
der the Trovble of fo particular Account of my
Works this Year as the firft; yet in general it
may be obferv'd, that I was very feldom idle;
but having regularly divided my Time, according
to the feveral daily Employments that were before
me, fuch as, f/V/Z, my Duty to God, and the read-:
ing the Scriptures, which I conftantly fet apart
fome time for thrice every Day. Secondly, The going
Abroad with my Gun for FoocT, which generally
took me up three Hours in every Morning, when
it did not Rain. Thirdly, The ordering, curing,
preferving, and cooking what 1 had ki I'd or catch'd
for my Supply ; thefe took up great Part of the
Day: alfo it is to be confider'd that the middle of
the day when the Sun was in the Zenith, the Vio-
lence of the Heat was too great to ftir out; fo that
about four Hours in the Evening was all the time
I could be fupposM to work in ; with this Excep-
tion, that fometimes I chang'd my Hours of
Hunting and Working, and went to work in the
Morning.,
Morning, and Abroad wich my Gun in the After-
noon.
To this fhort time allow'd for Labour, I defire
may be added the exceeding Laborioufnefs of my
* Work, the many Hours which for want of Tools,
want of Help, and want of Skill, every thing I
did, took up out of my Time : For Example, I
was full two and forty days making me a Board
for a long Shelf, which I wanted in my Cave;
whereas two Sawyers with their Tools, and a Saw-
Pit would have cut fix of them out of the lame
Tree in half a day.
My Cafe was this; it was to be a large Tree
which was to be cut down, becaufe my Board was
to be a broad one. This Tree I was three days
a cutting down, and two more cutting oft the
Bows, and reducing it to a Log, or Piece of Tim-
ber. With inexpieffible hacking and hewing t
reduced both the Sides of it into Chips, till it be-
gun to be light enough to move; then I turn'd it,
and made one fide of it fmooth, and flat, as a.
Board from End to End ; then turning that fide
downward, cut the other fide, till I brought the
Plank to be about three Inches thick, and fmooth
on both fides. Any one may judge the Labour of
my Hands in fuch a piece of Work; but Labour
and Patience carry'd me thro' that and many
other things: T. only obferve this in particular, to
fhew the Reafon why fo much of my time went
away with fo little Work, viz,. that what might
be a little to be done with Help and Tools, was a
vaft Labour, and requir'd a prodigious time to do
alone, and by hand. . *
Bnt notwithstanding this, with Patience and La-
bour I went thro' many things, and indeed every
thing that my Circumftances made neceflary to me
to do, as will appear by what follows.
K 4 I was
I was now in the Months pf November and De-.
ctmber, expecting my Crop of Barley and Rice.
The Ground I had manur'd or dug up for them
was not great; for as I obferv'd, my Seed of each
was not above the Quantity of half a Peck;
for I had loft one whole Crop by fowiug in the
dry Seafon; but now my Crop promis'd very well,
when on a fudden 1 found I was in Danger of
lofing it all again by Enemies of feveral forts,
which it was fcarce poffible to keep from it; as.
firft, the Goats, and wi!d Creatures which I call'd
Hares, who tafting the Sweetnefs of the Blade,
lay in it Night and Day, as fopn as it came up,
and eat it fo clofe, that it could get no time to
{hpot up into Stalk.
This I faw no Remedy for, but by making an
' Enclofure about it with a Hedge, which I did
with a great deal of Toil; and the more, becaufe
it requir'd Speed. However, as my Arable Land
was but fmall, fuited to my Crop, .' got it totally.
well fenced in about three Weeks time; and {hoot-
ing feme of the Creatures in the Day time, I fet
my Dpg to guard it in the Night, tying him up to
«. a Stake at the Gate, where he would Hand and
bark all Night Ipng; fo in a little time the Enemies
fprfook the Place, and the Corn grew very ftrong,
and well, and began to ripen apace.
But as the Beafls ruined me befpre, while my
.. Corn was in the Blade, fo the Birds were as likely.
to ruine me now, when it was in the Ear; for go-
ing along by the Place to fee how it throve, I faw
my little Crop furrounded with Fowls of I know
not how many forts, who flood as it were watch-
ing till I fhould be gone : I 'immediately let fly
among them (for I always had my Gun with me.)
1 had no fooner fhot but there rofe up a little
Qoud.
Cloud of Fowls, which I had not feen at all, from
among the Corn it feit.
Tnis touiu'd me teuliMy, for I forefaw, that in
a few l>ays they would devour all my Hopes, that
J fhould b£ ftarv'd, and never be able to raife a
Crop at alij and what to do I could not tell: How-
ever, I refolv'd not to lofe my Corn, if ppfEble,
fho? I fhould watch it Night and Day. In the
firft Place, I went among it to fee what Darrtage
was already done, and found they had fpoil'd a
good deal of it ; but that as it was yet too green
for them, the Lofs was not fo great, but that the
Remainder was iike to be a good Crop if it could
be fav'd.
I {laid by it to load my Gun, and then coming
away I could eafily fee the Thieves fitting upon all
the Trees about me, as if they only waited till I
was gone away, and the Event proved it to be fo;
for as I walk'd off as if I was gone, I was no {oon-
er out of their Sight, but they dropt down one by
one into the Corn again. 1 was fo provok'd that I
could not have Patience to ftay till more came on,
knowing that every Grain that they eat now, was,
OA it might be jaid, a Peck-loaf to me in the Confe-
quence ; but coming up to the Hedge, I fir'd a-
gain, and kill'd three of them. This was what I
wjfh'd for; fo I took them up, and ferv'd them as
we ferve notorious Thieves in England, (viz,.)
Hang'd them in Chains fora Terror to others. It
is impoflible to imagine almoft, that this fhould
have fuch an Effect as it had j for the Fowls would
not only not'come at the Corn, but in fhort they ror-
fook all that Part of the Ifland, and I could never
fee a Bird near the Place as long as my Scare-Crows
hung there.
This
J
This I was very glad of,you maybe fure^and a-
bout the latter end ot December, which was our fe-,
cond Harveft of the Year, 1 reap'd my Crop.
I was fadly put to it for a Scythe or a Sickle to
cut it down, and all I could do was to make one as
well as I could out'of one of the broad Swords or
Cutlaiies, which I fav'd among the Arms out of
the Ship. However, as my firft Crop was but fmall,
I had no great Difficulty to cut it down : in fhort,
I reap'd it my way, for I cut nothing off but the
Ears, and carry'd it away in a great Basket which
I had made, and fo rubb'd it out with my Hands;
and at the End of all my Harvefting, I found that
out of my half Peck of Seed, 1 had near two Bu-
fhels of Rice, and above two Bufhels and half of
Barley, that is to fay, by my Guefs, for I had no
Meafure at that time.
However, this was a great Encouragement to
me ; and I forefaw that in time, it would pleafe
God to fupply me with Bread : And yet here I
was perplex'd again, for I neither knew how to
grind or make Meal of my Corn, or indeed how
to clean it and part it; nor if made into Meal, how.
to make Bread of it; and if how to make it, yet I
knew not how to bake it: thefe things being added
to my Defire of having a good Quantity for Store,
and to fecure a conftant Supply, I refolv'd not to
tafte any of this Crop, but to preferve it all for Seen
againft the next Seafon, and in the mean time to
employ all my Study and Hours of working to ac-
complifh this great Work of providing myfelf with
Corn and Bread.
It might be truly faid, that now I work d tor
my Bread. "Tis a little wonderful, and what I be-
lieve few People have thought much upon, (viz,.) the
ftrange Multitude of little things nectary nvthe
Prcr
* . • . ' t - *
Providing, Producing, Curing, Dreffing, Making
and Finishing this one Article of Bread.
I that was reduced to a meer State of Nature,
found this to my daily Diicouragement, and was
made more arrd more fenfible of it every Hour, even
after I had got the tirft Handful of Seed-Corn,
which, as I have faid, came up unexpectedly, and
indeed to a Surprife.
Firft, I had no Plow to turn up the Earth, no
Spade or Shovel to dig it. Well, this I conquer'd,
by making a wooden Spade, as I obferv'd before j
but this did my Wo.k in but a wooden manner j
and tho' it coft me a great many Days to make it,
yet for want of Iron it not only wore out the {bon-
er, but made my Work the harder, and made it
be perform'd much worfe.
However, this I bore wiih, and was content to
work it out with Patience, and bear with the Bad-
nefs of the Performance. When the Corn was
fow'd, I had no Harrow, but was forced to go
over it my felf, and drag a great heavy Bough of a
Tree over it, to Scratch it, as it may be call'd, ra-
ther than Rake or Harrow it.
When it was growing and grown, I have ob-
ferv'd already how many things I wanted, to
fence it, fecure it, mow or reap it, cure\ and
carry it Home, thrafh, part it from the Chi'ff,
attd fave it, Then I wanted a Mill to grind it,
Sieves to drefs it, Yeaft and Salt to make it into
Bread, and an Oven .to bake it; and yet all thefe
things I did without, as fhall be obferv'd ; and
yet the Corn was an ineftimable Comfort and Ad-
vantage to me too. All this, as I faid, made
every thing laborious and tedious to me, but thac
there was no help for; neither was my time f<*
much Lofs to me, becaufe as I had divided ir, a
certain Par? of it was every Day appointed to
thefe
thefe Works ; and as I refolv'd to ufe none of the
' Corn for Bread till I had a greater Quantity by
me, I had the next fix Months to apply myfelf
wholly by Labour and Invention to furnim myfelf;
with Utenfils proper for the performing all the Q-
perations neceflary for the making the Corn (when,
I had it) fit for my ufe.
But rirft, I was to prepare more Land, for I
had now Seed enough to fow above an Acre of
Ground. Before I did this', I had a Weeks-work
at leaft to make me a Spade, which when it was
done was but a forty one indeed, and very heavy,
and requir'd double Labour to work with it;
^owever I went thro' that, and fow'd my Seed in
two large flat Pieces of Ground, as near my
Houle as I could find them to my Mind, and
fenc'd them in with a good Hedge, the Stakes of
which were all cut of that Wood which I had fet
before, and knew it would grow, fo that in one
Year's time I knew I fhould have a Quick or Li^
ving.Hedge, that would want but little Repair.
This Work was not fo little as to take me up lefs
than three Months, becaufe great Part of that time
was of the wet Seafon, when I could not go a-
broad.
Within Doors, that z>, when it rained, and \
could not go out, I found Employment on the fol-
lowing Occafions ; always obferving, that all the
while I was at work I diverted myfelf with talk-
' ing to my Parrot, and teaching him to Speak ;
and I quickly learned him to know his own Name,
and at laft to fpeak it out pretty loud, POLL,
which was the firft Word I ever heard fpoken in
the Ifland by any Mouth but my own. This
therefore was not'my Work, but an Afliftant" to my
Work; for now, as I faid, I had a great Employ-
ment upon my Hands, as follows^ (vi%.) I M
Ion5
3
Ibng ftudyM, by fome Means or other, to make
myfelffome Earthen Veflels, which indeed I want-
ed forely, but knew not where to come at them:
However, conlidering the Heat of the Climate, I
did not doubt but if I could find out any fuch
Clay, I might botch up fome fuch Pot, as might4
being dry'd in'theSun, be hard enough, and ftrong
enough to bear handling, and to hold any Thing
that was dry, and required to be kept fo ; and
as this was neceflary in the preparing Corn,
Meal, &c. which was the Thing I was upon, I
refolved to make fome as large as I could, and fit
only to ftand like Jars to hold what fhould be put
into them.
It would make the Reader pity me, or rather
laugh at me* to tell how many awkward Ways I
took to raife this Pafte, what odd mimapen ugly
things I made, how many of them fell in, and how.
many fell out, the Clay not being ftirT enough to
bear its own Weight ; how many crack'd by the •
over violent Heat of the Sun, being fet out too
haftily ; and how many fell in Pieces with only re-
moving, as well before as after they were dry'd ;
and in a word, how after having laboured hard
to find the Clay, to dig it, to temper it, to bring
it home and work it, I could not make above two
large earthen ugly things, 1 cannot call them Jarrs,
in about two Months Labour.
However, as the Suntkik'd thefe two very dry
and hard, I lifted them very gently up, and fee
them down again in two great Wicker-Baskets^
which I had made on purpofe for them, that 'they
might not break ; and as between the Pot and the
Basket there was a little room to fpare, I fiuff'd it
full of the Rice and Barley Straw, and thefe two
Pots being to ftand always dry, I thought would
hold
% '. .1 ;
1141 ]
hold my dry Corn, and perhaps the Meal, whert
the Corn was bruifed.
Tho' I mifcarried fo much in my Defign for
large Pots, yet I made feveral fmaller things with
better Succefs; fuch as little round Pots, flat Difh.'
es, Pitchers and Pipkins, and any things my Hand
turn'd to, and the Heat of the Sun bak'd them
ftrangely hard. ,
But all this would not anfwer my End, which
was to get an Earthen Pot to hold what was Li-
quid, and bear the Fire, which none of thefe could
do. It happen'd after fome time, making a pretty
large Fire for Cooking my Meat, when I went to
put it out after I had done with it, I found a bro-
ken Piece of one of my Earthen-ware Veflels in the
Fire, burnt as hard as a Stone, and red as a Tile,
I was agreeably furpriz'd to fee it, and faid to my
felf, that certainly they might be made to burn
whole, if they would burn broken.
This fet me to fludying how to order my Fire*
fo as to make it burn me fome Pots. I had no
notion of a Kiln, fuch as the Potters burn in, or
of glazing them with Lead, tho* I had fome Lead
to do it-with ; but I plac'd three large Pipkins,
and two or three Pots in a Pile one upon another,
and plac'd my Fire-wood all round it with a great
Heap of Em' ers under them ; I ply'd the Fire
with frefh Fuel round the out-fide, and upon the
top, till I faw the Pots in the infide red hot quite
thro', and obferv'd that they did not crack at all;
when I faw them clear red, I let them {land in
that Heat about y or 6 Hours, till I found one of
them, tho' it did not crack, did melt or run, foif
the Sand which was mixed with the Clay melted
by the Violence of rhe Heat, and would have run
into Glafs if I had gone on; fo I flack'd my Fire
gradually, till the Pots began to abate of the red
Colour, and watching them all Night, that I might
not let the Fire abate too faft, in the Morning I
had three very good, 1 will not fay handfome Pip-
kins , and two other Earthen Pots, as hard burnt
as could be denVd ; and one of them perfectly
glaz'd with the Running of the Sand.
After this Experiment, I need not fay that I
wanted no fort of Earthen Ware for my Ufe; buC
I muft needs fay, as to the Shapes of them, they
were very indifferent, as any one may fuppofe,when
1 had no way of making them, but as the Children
make Dirt-Pyes, or as a Woman would make Pye$
that never learnt to raife Pafte.
No Joy at a thing of fo mean a Nature was
ever equal to mine, when I found I had made an
Earthen Pot that would bear the Fire ; and I had
hardly Patience to flay till they were cold, before
I fet one upon the Fire again, with fome Water in
it, to boil me fome Meat, which it did admirably
well ; and with a Piece of a Kid I made fome very
good Broth, though 1 wanted Oatmeal, and feve-
ral other Ingredients requifite to make it fo good
as I would have had it been.
My next Concern was, to get me a Stone Mor-
tar to ftamp or beat fome Corn in ; for as to the
Mill, there was no thought at arriving to that Per-
fection of Art, with one Pair of Hands. To fup-
p!y this Want I.was at a great Lofs ; for of all
Trades in the World I was as perfectly unqualified
for a Stone-Cutter, as for any whatever; neither had
1 any Tools to go about it with. 1 fpent many a
Day to find out a great Stone big enough to .cut
hollow, and make fit for a Mortar, and could find
none at all ; except what was in the folid Rock,
and which I had no way to dig or cut out ; nor in-
deed were the Rocks in the Ifland of Hardnefs fuf-
ficient, but were all of a fandy crumbling Stone,
which
which would neither bear the Weight of a heavy
Peftle, or would break the Corn without filling it
Vith Sand ; fo after a great deal of Time loft in
Searching for a Stone, I gave it over, and refolv'd
to look out for a great Block of hard Wood, which
1 found indeed much eafier; and getting one as
big as I had Strength to ftir, I rounded it, and
form'd it on the Outfide with my Axe and Hatcher;
and then with the Help of Fire and infinite Labour;
made a hollow Place in it, as the Indians in Brafil
make their Games. After this, I made a great hea-
yy Peftle or Beater, of the Wood call'd the Ironr
Wood, and this I prepared and laid by againft I
had my next Crop of Corn, when I propos'd to
myfelf to grind, or rather pound, my Corn into
Meal to make my Bread.
My next Difficulty was to make a Sieve, or
Search, to drefs my Meal, and to part it from the
Bran, and the Husk, without which I did not fee
it poffible I could have any Bread. This was a
moft difficult thing, fo much as but to think on ;
For to be fure I had nothing like the necefl'ary thing
to make it; I mean fine thin Canvas, or Stuff to
fearch the Meal through. And here I was at a full
Stop for many Months ; nor did I really know
what to do j Linnen I had none left, but what was
meer Rags ; I had Goats Hair, bat neither knew
I how to weave it, or fpin it; and had I known
how, here was no Tools to work it with ; all the
Remedy that I found for this, was, That at laft I
did remember I had among the Seamens Cloaths
which werefav'd out of the Ship, fome Neckcloths
of Ca'licoe or Muflin ; and with fome Pieces of
thefe.l made three fmall Sieves, but proper enough
for the Work; and thus I made Cbift for fome Years $
how I did afterwards, I fhallfhewjn its Place.
The
i 1451
The baking Part was the next thing to be con-
fider'd, and how I mould make Bread when Icame
to have Corn ; for firft I had no Yeaft ,- as to that
Part, as there was no fupplymg the Want, fo 1 did
not concern my felf much about it : But for an
Ovehi I was indeed in great Pain : at length I
found out an Experiment tor that alfo, which was
this; I made fome Earthen Veffels very broad, but
riot deep ; that is to fay, about two Foot Diame-
ter, and not above nine Inches deep : thefe I burnt
in the Fire, as I had done the other, and laid them
By; and when I wanted to bake, I made a great
Fire upon my Hearth, which I had pav'd with
fome fquare Tiles of my own making and burning
alfo; but I mould not call them fquare.
._ When the Fire-wood was burnt pretty much intb
Embers, or live Coals, I drew themforward upon
this Hearth, fo as to cover it all over, and there I
let them lie, till the Hearth was very hot; theri
fweeping away all the Embers, I fet down my
Loaf, or Loaves, and whelming down the Earthen
Pot upon them, drew the Embers all round the
Outfide of the Pot, to keep in, and add to the
Heat ; and thus, as well as in the belt Oven in the
World, I bak'd my Barley-Loaves, and became in
little time a meer Paftry-Ccbk into the Bargain ;
for I made myfelf feveral Cakes of the Rice and
Puddings ; indeed I made no Pies, neither had I any
Thing to put into them, fuppofing I had, except
the Fleih either of Fowls or Goats.
It need riot be wondered at, if* alj thefe things
took me up moft Part of the third Year of my A-
bode here ; for it is to be obferv'd, That in the In-
tervals of thefe Things, I had my new Harveft and
Husbandry to manage; for I reap'd my Corn in its
Seafori, and carried it Home as well as I could, and
hid it Up in the Ear, in my large Baskets, till I hacl
L Tiftic
Time to rub it out; for I had no Floor to thraft
it on, or Inftrument to thrafh it with.
And now indeed my Stock of Corn increafing, I
really wanted to build my Barns bigger : I wanted a
Place to 'ay it up in ; for the Increafe of the Corn
now yielded me fo much, that I had of the Barley
about twenty Bufhels, and of the Rice as much,
or mo; e, inibmuch, that now I refolv'd to begin
to ufe it freely ; for m.y Bread had been quite gone
a grcat'while ; alfo 1 refolv'd to fee what Quanti-
ty would be fufficient for me a whole Year, and to
fow but once a Year.
Upon the whole, I found that the forty Bufhels
of Barley and Rice was much more than I could
con fume in a Year; fo I refolv'd to fow juft the fame
.Quantity every Year that I fowed the laft, in hopes
that fitch a Quantity would fully provide me with
Bread, &c.
All the while thefe Things were doing, you may
be fure my Thoughts run many times upon the
Profpect of Land which I had feert from the other
Side of the Ifland, and I was not without fecret
Wifhes that I were on Shore there, fancy ing the fee-
ing the main Land, and in an inhabited Country,
I might find fome Way or other to convey my
felf farther, and perhaps at laft find fome Means of
Efcape. ,
But all this while I made no Allowance for the
Bangers of fuch a Condition, and how I might fall
into the Hands of Savages, and perhaps fuch as I
might have Reafon to think far worfe than the Li-
ons and Tigers of Africa. That if I once came in-
to their Power, I fhould run a Hazard more than a
Thoufand to One of being kill'd, and perhaps of be-
ing eaten; for 1 had heard that the People of the Car-
ribean Coafts were Cannibals, or Man-eaters ; and
I knew by the Latitude, that I could not be far oft
from
from that Shore. Thatfuppofe they were not Can-
nibals, yet that they might kill me, as many Euro*
feans who had fallen into their Hands had been fer-
ved, even when they had been ten or twenty toge-
ther ; much more I that was but one, and could
make little or no Defence. All thefe things, I fay,
which i ought to have confider'd well of, and did
caft up in my Thoughts afterwards, yet took up
none of my Apprehenfions at firft ; but my Head
run mightily upon the Thought of getting over to
the Shore.
Now I wifh'd for my Boy Xuryy and the Long-
Boat with the bhoulder of Mutton Sail, with which
I fail'd above a thoufand Miles on the Coaft of A"
frick; but this was in vain. Then I thought I would
go and look at our Ship's Boat, which, as I have
laid, was blown up upon the Shore a great Way in
the Storm, when we were firft caft away. She lay
almoft where ffie did at firft, but not quite ; and
was turn'd by the Force of the Waves and the
Winds, almoft Bottom upward, againft a high
Ridge of Beachy rough Sand; but no Water abouc
her as before.
If I had had Hands to have refitted her, and to
have launch'd her inttf the Water, the Boat would
have done well enough, and I might have gone
back into the Brajtls with her eafily enough • but I
might have foreieen, that I could no more turn her, .
and fet her upright upon her Bottom, than I could
remove the Ifland : However, I went to the
Woods and cut Levers and Rollers, and brought
them to the Boat, refolv'd to try what I could do j
fuggefting to myfelf, that if 1 could but turn hec
down, I might eafily repair the Damage fhe had
receiv'd, and {he would be a very good Boat, and
1 might go to Sea in her very eafily.
I fp.ir'd no Pains indeed, in.this Piece of fniitlefs
Toil, and fpentj I think, three or four Weeks a-
L a bout
bout it; at laft finding it impoflible to heave it up
with my little Strength, 1 fell to digging away the
Sand to undermine it, and foto make it fall down;
fetting Pieces of Wood to thruft and guide it right
in the Fall.
But when I had done this, I was unable to ftir it
up again, or to get under it, much lefs to move it
forward towards the Water; fo I was forc'd to give
it over; and yet, though I gave over the Hopes of
the Boat, my defire to venture over for the Main
increafed, rather than decreafed, as the Means for
it feem'd impoflible.
This at length put me upon thinking, Whether
it was not poffible to make myfelf a Came, or Peria-
gua, fuch as the Natives of thofe Climates make,
even without Tools, or, as 1 might fay, without
Hands, •viz.. of the Trunk of a great Tree. This I
not only thought poflible, but eafy, and pleas'd
myfelf extreamly with the Thoughts of rasking it,
and with my having much more Convenience for it
than any of the Negroes or Indians j but not at all
confidering the particular Inconveniences .which I
lay under, more than the Indians did, viz,. Want of
Hands to move it, when it was made, into the Wa-
ter ; a Difficulty much harder for me to furmount,
than all the Confequences of want of Tools could
be to them : For what was it to me, That when I
had chofen a vaft Tree in the Woods, I might with
much Trouble cut it down, if after I might be a-
ble with my Tools to hew and dub the Out fide
into the proper Shape of a Boat, and burn or cut
out the Infide to make it hollaw, fo to make a Boat
of it, if after all this, I muft leave it juft there
where I found it, and was not able to launch it in-
to the Water.
One would have thought, I could not have had
the leaft Reflection upon my Mind of my Circum-
ftance,
f i45> 1
ftance, while I was making this Boat, but I mould
have immediately thought how I fhould get it into
the Sea ; but my Thoughts were fo intertt upon
my Voyage over the Sea in it, that I never once
confider'd how I mould get it oft' of the Land ;
and it was really in its own Nature more eafy tor
me to guide it over forty five Miles of Sea, than
about forty five Fathom of Land, where it lay, to
fet it a float in the Water.
I went to work upon this Boat the moft like a
Fool that ever Man did, who had any of his Scales
awake. I pleas'd myfelf with the Defign, wtth-
out determining whether I was ever able to under-
take it; not but that the Difficulty of launching
my Boat came often into my Head; but I put a
flop to my own Enquiries into it, by this foolifh
Anfwer which I gave myfelf, Let's firft make it, Vll
•warrant I'll find fome Way or other toget it along, when
'tis done.
'• This was a moft prepofterous Method ; but the
Eagernefs of my Fancy prevail'd, and to work I
went. I fell'd a Cedar Tree : I queftion much
whether Solomon ever had fuch a one for the Build-
ing of the Temple at Jerufalem. It was five Foot
ten Inches Diameter at the lower Part next the
Stump, and four Foot eleven Inches Diameter ^c
the End of twenty two Foot, after which it lef-
fen'd for a while, and then parted into Branches :
It was not without infinite Labour that I fell'd
this Tree: I was twenty Days hacking and hew-
ing at it at the Bottom. I was fourteen more get-
ting the Branches and Limbs, and the vaft fpread-
ing Head of it cut off, which I haclc'd and hew'd
through with Axe and Hatchet, and inexpreflible
Labour: After this, it coft me a Month to fhapd
it, and dub it to a Proportion, and to fomething
like the Bptcom of a Boat, that it might fwim up-
L 3 right
right as it ought to do. It coft me near three
Months more to clear the Infide, and work it out
fo, as to make an exact Boat of it: This I did in-
deed without Fire, by mere Mallet and Chiffel, and
by the dint of hard Labour, till 1 had brought it to
be a very handfome Penagua, and big enough to
have carried fix and twenty Men, and confequently
big enough to have carried me and all my Cargo.
When I had gone through this Work, I was ex-
tremely delighted with it. The Boat was really
much bigger than I ever faw a Canoe, or Periagua^
that was made of one Tree, in my Life. Many a
weary Stroke it had coft, you may be fure ; and
there remained nothing but to get it into theWater;
and had I gotten it into the Water,.I make no que-
ftion, but 1 fhould have began the maddeft Voyage
and the moil unlikely to be perform'd, that ever
vyas undertaken.
" But all my Devices to get it into the Water
fail'd me, though they coft me infinite Labour too.
It lay about one hundred Yards from the Water,
and not more : But the firft Inconvenience was, it
was up Hill towards the Creek : well, to take a-
way this Difcouragement, I refolv'd to dig into
the Surface of the Earth, and fo make a Declivi-
ty : This I begun, and it coft me a prodigious deal
of Pains ; but who grudges Pains, that have! their
Deliverance in View ? But when this was work'd
through, and this Difficulty manag'd, it was ftill
much at one; for I could no more flir the Canoe,
than I could the other Boat.
Then I meafur'd the Diftance of Ground, and
refolv'd to cut a Dock, or Canal, to bring the Wa-
ter np to the Canoe, feeing I could not bring the
Canoe down to the Water : Well, I began this
Work, and when I began to enter into it, and cal-
culate how deep it was to be dug, how broad,
how
how the Stuff to be thrown out, I found, that'by
the number of Hands I had, being none but my
own, it muft have been ten or twelve Years before
I fhould have gone through with it; for the Shore
lay high, fo that at the upper End it muft have
been at leaft twenty Foot deep; fo at length, tho'
with great Reludancy, I gave this Attempt over
alfo.
This griev'd me heartily, and now I (aw, tho'
too late, the Folly of beginning a Work before we
count the Coft, and before we judge rightly of
our own Strength to go through with it.
In the middle of this Work, 1 fimuYd my fourth
Year in this Place, and kept my Anniverfary with
the fame Devotion, and with as much Comfort as
ever before ; for by a conftant Study, and fcn'ous
Application of the Word of God, and by the Af-
fiftance of his Grace, I gain'd different Know-
ledge from what I had before. 1 entertain'd diffe-
rent Notions of things. 1 look'd now upon the
World as a thing remote, which I had nothing to
do with, no Expectation from, and indeed no De-
fires about: In a word, I had nothing indeed to
do with it, nor was ever like to have ; fo I thought
it look'd as we may perhaps look upon it hereafter,
•viz,, as a Place I had lived in, but was come out of
it ; and well might I fay, as Father Abraham to
Dives, Between me and thee is a great Gulph fixed.
In the firfl Place, I was removed fiom all the
Wickednefsofthe World here : I had neither the
Luft of the Fle/Jj, the Luft of the Eye, or the Pride of
Life. I had nothing to covet; for I had all that [
was now capable of enjoying : I was Lord of tli-e'
whole Manor; or if I pleas'd, I mi^ht call mykk"
King, or Emperor over the whole Country winch
I had Pofleffion of. There were no Rivals : I' hid'
no Competitor, none to difpute Sovereignty of
L 4 Com-
.'w.
Command with me.. * I might have rais'd Ship
Loadings of Corn; but I had no ufe for it; fo I let
as little grow as I thought enough for my Occafion.
I had Tortoife or Turtles enough; but now and
then one was as much as I could put to any ufe. I
had Timrer enough to have built a Fleet of Ships.
I >had Grapes enough to have made Wine, or to
have ci.r'd into Raifins, to have loaded that Fleet
when the£ had been built.
••» But all I could make ufe of, was, All that was
valuably. I had enough to eat, and to fupply my
Wants, and, what was all the reft to me ? If I
kill'd more Flefh than I could eat, the Dog muft eat
it, or the Vermin. If I fow\i more Corn than I
could eat, it mult be fpoil'd. The Trees that I
cut down, were lying to rot on the Ground : I
Could make no more ufe of them than for Fewei,
and that I had no Occafion for, but to drefs my
Food.
In a Word, the Nature and Experience of
Things dictated to me upon juft Reflection, that
all the good Things of this World, are no farther
good to us, than they are for our Ufe ; and that
whatever we may heap up indeed to give others,
we enjoy juft as much as we can ufe, and no more.
The moft covetous griping Mifer in the World
would have been cured of the Vice of Covetoufnefs,
if he had been in my Cafe • for I pofTefled infinitely
more than I knew what to do with. I had no room.
for Defire, except it was of things which I had
not, and they were but Trifles, tho' indeed of
great ufe to me. I had, as I hinted before, a Par-
cel of Money, as well Gold as Silver, about thirty
fix Pounds Sterling : Alas! there the nafty forry
ufelefs Stuff lay; I had no manner of Bufinefs
for it • and I often thought with myfelf, that I
have given a Handful of it for a Grofs of
Tobacco,-
t '53
Tobacco-Pipes, or for a Hand-mill to grind my
Corn; nay, I would have given it all for Sixpenny-
worth of Turnip and Carrot Seed out of England, or
for a Handtul of Peafe and Beam, and a Bottle of
Ink: As it 'Jiast I had not the leaft Advantage by
it, or Benefit from it; but there it lay in a Drawer,
and grew mouldy with the Damp of the Cave, in
the wet Seafon ; and if I had had the Drawer full
of Diamonds, it had been the fame Gale; and
they had been of no manner of Value to me, be-
faufe of no Ufe. V*
I had now brought my State of Life to be much
eafier in itfelf than it was at firft, and much eafier
to my Mind, as well as to my Body. I frequently
fat down to my Meat with Thankfulnefs, and adr-
mired the Hand of God's Providence, which had
thus fpread my Table in the Wildernefs. I learned
to look more upon the bright Side of my Condi-
tion, and lefs upon the dark Side; and to confider
what I enjoy'd, rather than what I wanted ; and
this gave me fometimes fuch fecret Comforts, that
I cannot exprefs them ; and which I take Notice
of here, to put thofe discontented People in mind
of it, who cannot enjoy comfortably what God
has given them, becaufe they fee, and covet fome-
thing that he has not given them. All our Dif-
contents about what we want, appeared to me to
fpring from the Want of Thankfulnefs for what we
have.
Another Reflection was of great Ufe to me, and
doubtlcfs would be fo to any one that fhould fall
into fuch Diftrefs as mine was; and this was to
compare my prefent Condition with what I at jfirft
expected it fhould be; nay, with what it would
certainly have been, if the good Providence of
God had not wonderfully ordered the Ship to be
caft up nearer to the Shpre, where I riot only could
come
come at her, but could bring what I got out of her
to the Shore, for my Relief and Comfort; without
which, I had wanted for Tools to work, Weapons
for Defence, or Gun-powder and Shor for getting
my Food. ,
I fpent whole Hours, I may fay whole Days, in
representing to myfelf in the moft lively Colours,
how I muft have acted, if I had got nothing out
of the Ship; how I could not have fo much as
got any Food, except Fifh and Turtles; and that
as it was long before I found any of them, I muft
have perifh'd firft : That I mould have liv'd, if I
had not perifh'd, like a meer Savage: that if I
had kill'd a Goat, or a Fowl, by any Contrivance,
I had no way to flea or open them, or part the Fiefh
from the Skin and the Bowels, or to cut it up ;
but muft gnaw it with my Teeth, and pull it with
my Claws like a Beaft.
Thefe Reflections made me very fenfible of the
Goodnefs of Providence to me, and very thankful
for my prefent Condition, with all its Hardfhips
and Misfortunes: And this Part alfo 1 cannot but
recommend to the Reflection of thofe who are apt
in their Mifery to fay, Is any Afflittion like mine !
Let them confider, how much worfe the Cafes of
fome People are, and their Cafe might have been,
if Providence had thought fit.
I had another Reflection which affifted me alfo
to comfort my Mind with Hopes; and this was
comparing my prefent Condition with what I had
deferv'd, and had therefore Reafon to expect from
the Hand of Providence. I had liv'd a dreadful
Life, perfeaiy deftitute of the Knowledge and Fear
of G OD. I had been well inftruded by Father and
Mother; neither had they been wanting to me in
their early Endeavours, to infnfe a religious Awe
of G o D into my Mind, a Senfe of my Duty, and
of
of what the Nature and End of my Being requir'd
of me. But alas 1 falling early into the Sea-taring
Life, which of all the Lives is the moft deftitu'te
of the Fear of GOD, tho' his Terrors are al-
ways before them; I fay, falling early into the
Sea-faring Life, and into Sea-fating Company, all
that little Senfe of Religion which I had enter-
tain'd, waslaugh'd out of me by my Mefs-mates,
by a harden'd defpifiug of Dangers, and the Views
of Death, which grew habitual to me, by my long
Abfence from ail manner of Opportunities to con-
verfe with any thing but what was like myfelf,
or to hear any thing that was good, or tended to-
wards it.
So void was I of every thing that was good, or
of the lean: Senfe of what I was, or was to be,
that in the greetet t Deliverances 1 enjoy 'd, fuch
as my Efcape from Saffe, my being taken up by
the Portuguese Mafter of the Ship, my being plant-
ed fo well in the Brajils, my receiving the Cargo
from England, and the like, I never had once the
Word Thank God, fo much as t>n my Mind, or in-
my Mouth ; nor in the greateft Diftrefs, had I fo
much as a Thought to pray to him • or fo much as.
to fay, Lord have Mercy upon me; no nor to mention
the Name of GOD, .unlefs it was to fwear by,
and blafpheme it.
I had terrible Reflections upon my Mind fot:
many Months, as I have already obferv'd, on the
Account of my wicked and hardned Life paft ; and
when I look'd about me, and confider'd what parti-
cular Providences had attended me fince my com-
ing into this Place, and how God had dealt boun-
tifully with me; had not only punifh'd me lefs than
my Iniqfety had deferv'd, but had fo plentifully pro-
v ded for me j this gave me great Hopes that my
t Repen-
Repentance was accepted, and that God had yet
Mercy in ftore for me.
With thefe Reflections I work'd my Mind up,
pot only to Refignation to the Will'of God in the
prefent Difpofition of my Circumftances, but even
to a fincere Thankfulnefs for my Condition; and
that I who was yet a living Man, ought not to
complain, feeing I had not the due Punifhment of
my Sins; fhat I enjoy'd fo many Mercies which
I had no reafon to have expected in that Place;
that I ought never more to repine at my Condition,
but to rejoyce, and to give daily Thanks for that
daily Bread which nothing but a croud of Wonders
Could have brought. That I ought to confider I
had been fed even by Miracle, even as great as
that of feeding Elijah by Ravens; nay, by a long
Series of Miracles, and that I cofild hardly have
nam'd a Place in the unhabitable Part of the World
where I could have been caft more to my Advan-
tage : A Place, where as I had no Society, which'
was my Affliction on one hand, fo I found no rav
venous Beafts, no furious Wolves or Tygers to
threaten my Life, no venomous Creatures or poi-
fonous, which I might feed on to my hurt, no Sa-
vages to murder and devour me.
In a Word, as my Life was a Life of Sorrow'
one way, fo it was a Life of Mercy another ; and
I wanted nothing to make it a Life of Comfort,
but to be able to make my Senfe of God's Good-
nefs to me, and Care over me in this Condition,
be my daily Confolation ; and after I did make a
juft Improvement of thefe things, I went away and
was no more fad.
I had now been here fo long, that many things
which I brought on Shore for my Help, were either
quite gpne, or very much wafted and near fpent.
My
My Ink, as I obferv'd, had been gone for fomg
time, all but a very little, which I eek'd out with
Water a little and a little, till it was fo pale it fcarce
left any Appearance of black upon the Paper: As
long as it lafled I made ufe of it to minute down
the Days of the Month on which any remarkable
thing happen'd to me ; and firft by calling up
Times patt, I remember that there was a ftrange
Concurrence of Days in the various Providences
which befei me, and which, if I had been fupef-
ftitioufly inclin'd to obferve Days as Fatal or For-
tunate, I might have had Reafon to have look'd
upon with a great deal of Curiofity.
Firft, I had obferv'd, that the fame Day that I
broke away from my Father and my Friends, and
run away to Hull in order to go to Sea, the fame
Day afterwards I was taken by the Sails Man of
War, and made a Slave.
The fame Day of the Year that I efcaped out
of the Wreck of that Ship in Yarmouth Roads, that
fame Day-Year afterwards I made my efcape from
SaUe in the Boat.
The fame Day of the Year I was born on, (viz,.)
the joth of September, the fame Day I had my
Life fo miraculoutly faved 26 Years after, when I
was caft on Shore in this Ifland; fo that my wicked
Life and my folitary Life begun both on a Day.
The next thing to my Ink's being wafted, was
that of my Bread, I mean the Bisket which I
brought out of the Ship : this I had husbanded to
the laft degree, allowing myfelf but one Cake of
Bread a Day for above a Year, and yet I was quite
without Bread for near a Year before I got any
Corn of my own; and great Reafon I had to be
thankful that I had any at all, the getting it being.,
as has been already obferved, next to miraculous.
My
My Cloaths began to decay too mightily: As t»
Linnen, 1 had had none a good while, except feme
chequerM Shirts which I found in the Chefts of the
other Seamen, and which I carefully preferv'd, be-
- caufe many times 1 could bear no other Cloaths
pu but a Shirt; and it was a very great help to me
that I had among all the Mens Cloaths of the Ship
almoit three dozen of Shirts. There were alfo fe-
yeral thick Watch-coats of the Seamens, which
were left indeed, but they were too hot to wearj
and tho' it is true, that the Weather was fo violent
hot that there was no need of Cloaths, yet I could
not go quite naked ; no, tho' I had been inclined
to it, which I was nor, nor could not abide the
Thoughts of it, tho' I was all alone.
The Reafon why 1 could not go quite naked,
was, I could not bear the Heat of the Sun fo
well when quite naked, as with fome Cloaths on;
nay, the very Heat frequently blifter'd my Skin $
whereas with a Shirt on, the Air itfelf made fome
Motion, and whittling under that Shirt, was twofold
cooler than without it: No more could 1 ever bring
myfelf to go out in the Heat of the Sun without a
Cap or a Hat; the Heat of the Sun beating with
fuch Violence as it does in that Place, would give
me the Head-ach prefently, by darting fo directly
on my Head, without a Cap or a Hat on; fo that I
could not bear it; whereas if I put on my Hat, it
would prefently go away.
Upon thofe Views I began to confider about put-
ting the few Rags I had, which I called Cloaths,
into fome Order: I had worn out all the, Waift-
coats.1 had, and my Bufinefs was now to try if I
could not make Jackets out of the great Watch-
coats which I had by me, and with fuch other
Materials as I had; fo I fet to work a Tayloring,
or rather indeed a Botching; for I made moft
piteous
piteous Work of it. However, I made fhift to
make two or three new Waiftcoats, which I hoped
would ferve me a great while; as foriBreeches or
Drawers, I made but a very forry fmft indeedj till
afterward.
I have mentioned, that I faved the Skins of all
the Creatures that I kill'd, I mean four-footed ones,
and I had hung them up ftretch'd out with Sticks
in the Sun, by which means fome of them were fo
dry and hard that they were fit for little, but others
it feems were very ufeful. The firft thiag I made
of thefe was a great Cap for my Head, with the
Hair on the Outfide to moor off the Rain; and
this I perform'd fo well, that after this I made me
a Suit of Cloaths whoily of thefe Skins, that is to
lay, a Waiftcoat and Breeches open at Knees, and
both loofe, for they were rather wanting to keep
me cool than to keep me warm. I muft not omic
to acknowledge that they were wretchedly made j
for if I was a bad Carpenter, 1 was a worfe Taylor.
However, they were fuch as I made very good
fhift with ; and when I was abroad, if it happen'd
to rain, the Hair of my Waiftcoat and Cap being
outermoft, 1 was kept very dry.
After this I fpent a great deal of Time and Pains
to make me an Umbrella; I was indeed in great
want of one, and had a great mind to make one ;
I had feen them made in the Brafik, where they
are very ufeful in the great Heats which are there :
And I felt the Heats every jot as great here, and
greater too, being nearer the Equinox; befides, as
1 was obliged to be much abroad, it was a moft
ufeful thing to me, as well for the Rains as the
Heats. 1 took a world of Pains at it, and was a
great while before I could make any thing likely
to hold; nay, after I thought I had hit the way, I
fpoil'd 2 or 3 before I made one to my mind; but
at
at laft I made one that anfwer'd indifferently well i
the main difficulty I found was to make it to let
down : I could make it to fpread, but if it did not
let down too, and draw in, it was not portable for
me any way but juft over my Head, which would
not do. However, at laft, as I faid, I made one
to anfwer, and cover'd it with Skins, the Hair up-
wards, fo that it caft off the Rains like a Pent-
houfe, and kept off the Sun fo effectually, that I
could walk out in the hotteft of the Weather with
greater Advantage than I could before in the cool-
eft, and when I had no need of it, could clofe it
and carry it under my Arm. • ;.
Thus I lived mighty comfortably, my Mind be-
ing entirely compofed by refigning to the Will of
God, and throwing myfelf wholly upon the Dif-
pofal of his Providence. This made my Life bet-
ter than fbtiable ; for when I began to regret the
want of Converfation, I would ask myfelf,whether
thus converfing mutually with my own Thoughts,.
and, as I hope I may fay, with even God himfelf
by Ejaculations, was not better than the utmoft
Enjoyment of humane Society in the World?
I cannot fay that after this, for five Years, any
extraordinary thing happen'd to me, but I Hv'd on
in the fame courfe, in the fame Pofture and Place,
as juft before. The chief things I was employ'd in,
befides my yearly Labour of planting my Barley and
Rice, and curing my Raifins, of both which I al-
ways kent up juft enough to have fufficient Stock
of one Year's Provifions beforehand; I fay, befides
this yearly Labour, and my daily Labour of going
out with my Gun, I had one Labour to make me a
Canoe, which at laft I finifhed: So that by dig-
Ring a Canal to it of fix Foot wide, and four Foot
deep, I brought it into the Creek, almdft half a
Mile. As'for the firft, which was fovaftly big. .
as
as 1 made it without confidering before-hand, as I
ought to do, how I fhould be able to launch it; fo
never being able to bring it to the Water, or bring.
the Water to it, I was oblig'd to let it lie where it
was, as a Memorandum to teach me to be wifer next
Time : Indeed, the next Time, tho' I could not
get a Tree proper for it, and in a Place where I
could not get the Water to it, at any lefs Diftance
than as I have faid, near half a Mile; yet as I faw
it was practicable at laft, I never gave it over; and
though I was near two Years about it, yet I never
grudg'd my Labour, in Hopes of having a Boat to
go oft to Sea at laft.
. However , though my little Perfagua was fi-
nifh'd, yet the Size of it was not at all anfwerable
to the Defign which I had in View, when I made
the firft; I mean, of venturing over to the 'Terra
Firma, where it was above forty Miles broad; ac-
cordingly, the Smallnefs of my Boat aflifted to put
an End to that Defign, and now I thought no more
of it: But as I had a Boat, my next Defign was to
make a Tour round the Ifland ; for as I had been on
the other Side, in one Place, croffing, as I have al-
ready defcrib'd it, over the Land ; fo the Difcove-
ries I made in that little Journey, made me very ea-
ger to fee other Parts of the Coaft ; and now I had
a Boat, I thought of nothing but failing rouncUhe
Wand.
For this Purpofe, that I might do every Thing.
with Difcretion and Consideration, I fitted up a lit-
tle Maft to my Boat; and made a Sail to it out of
Come of the Pieces of the Ship's Sail, which lay in
flore ; and of which I had a great Stock by me.
Having fitted my Maft and Sail, and try'd the
Boat, I found fhe would fail very well : Then I
made little Lockers, or Boxes, at either End of my
Boat, to put Provifions, Ncceflkries and. Ammuni-
M tior>
tion, dTf. into, to be kept dry, either from Rain,
or the Sprye of the Sea; and a little long hollow
Place I cut in the Iniide of the Boat, where I could
lay my Gun, making a Flap to hang down over it
to keep it dry.
I nVd my Umbrella alfo in a Step at the Stern,
like a Matt, to iland over my Head, and keep the
Heat of the Sun off of me like an Aiming ; and
thus I every now and then • took a little Voyage
upon the Sea, but never went far out, not far from
the little Creek ; but at laft being eager to view
the Circumference of my little Kingdom, I re/blv'd
upon my Tour, and accordingly I viciuall'd my
Ship for the Voyage, putting in two Dozen of
my Loaves, (Cakes I {hould rather call them) of
Barley Bread, an Earthen Pot foil of parch'd Rice,
a Food t eat a great deal of, a little Bottle of Rum,
halfa Goat, and Powder and Shot for killing more,,
and two large Watch-coats, of thofe which, as I
raention'd before, I had fav'd out of the Seamen's
Chefts ; thefe I took, one to lie upon, and the
other to cover me in the Night.
It was the fixth of November, in the fixth Year
of my Reign, or my Captivity, which you pleafe,
that I fet out on this Voyage, and I found it much
longgr than I expected; for though the Ifland itfelf
was not very large, yet when I came to the Eaft
Side of it, I found a great Ledge of Rocks lie out
above two Leagues into the Sea, fome above Wa-
ter, fome under it ; and beyond that, a Shoal of
Sand, lying dry halfa League more ; fo that I was
oblig'd to go a great Way out to Sea to double the.
Point.
When firft I difcover'd them, I was going to give
over my Enterprise, and come back again, not
knowing how far it might oblige me to go out tQL
Sea ; and above all, doubting how I fhould get back
again ;
E
again ; fo I came to an Anchor; for I had made
me a kind of an Anchor with a Piece of a broken
Graplin, which I got out of the Ship.
Having fecur'd my Boat, I took my Gun, and
went on Shore, climbing up upon a Hill, which
feem'd to overlook that Point, where I faw the
full Extent of it, and refolv'd to venture.
In my viewing the S^a from that Hill where I
ftood, I perceived a ftrong, and indeed, a moft fu-
rious Current, which run to the Eaft, and even
came clofe to the Point; and I took the more No-
tice of it, becanfe I law there might be fome Dan-
ger, that when I came into it, I might be carry'd
out to Sea by the Strength of it, and not be able
to make the Illand again; and indeed, had I not
gotten firft up upon this Hill, I believe it would
have been fo ; for there was the fame Current on
the other Side • the liland, only that it fet off -at
a farther Diilance ; and I faw there was a flrong
Eddy under the Shore; fo I had nothing to do but
to get in out of the firft Current, and I Ihould
prefently be in an Eddy.
I lay here, however, two Days ; becaufe the
Wind blowing pretty frefh at E. S. E. and that
being juft contrary to the faid Current, made a
great Breach of the Sea upon the Point; fo that it
was not fafe for me to keep too .clofe to the Shore
for the Breach, nor to go too far off becaufe of the
. Streatp.,',..,
.. The (third Day in.the Morning, the Wind ha-
ying abated over Night, the Sea was calm, and I
vcnturd^ but I am a warning Piece again tc&dl
rafh and ignorant Pilpts; for no fooner was I come
to the Point, when even I was not my Boat's
Length .from the Shore, but I found my (elf in a
great Depth of Water, and a Current like the Sluice
of-.a Mill: It carry'd my Boat along with ic
M 2 with
with fuch Violence, that all I could do, could not
keep her*fo much as on the Edge of it; but I found
it hurried me farther and farther out from the Ed-
dy, which was on my Left Hand. There was no
YVind ftirring to help me, and all I could do with
my Paddlers fignify'd nothing ;-and now I began to
give myfelf over for loft; for as the Current was
on both Sides the Ifland, I knew in a few Leagues
Diftance they muft join again, and then I was ir-
recoverably gone; nor did I fee any Poffibility of
avoiding it; fo that I had no Profpeflt before me
but of Perifhing; not by the Sea, for that was
calm enough, but of ftarving for Hunger. I had
indeed found a Tcrtoife on the Shore, as big al-
moft as I could lift, and had tofs'd it into the
Boat; and I had a great Jar of frefh Water, that is
to fay, one of my Earthen Pots; but what was all
this to being driven into the vaft Ocean, where, to
be fure, there was no Shore, no main Land, or Ifland,
for a thoufand Leagues at leaft ?
And now I faw how eafy it was for the Provi-
dence of God to make the moft miferable Condi-
tion Mankind could be in, -morfe. Now I look'd
back upon my defolate folitary Ifland, as the moft
pleafant Place in the World, and'all the Happinefs
my Heart could wifh for, was to be but there
again. I ftretch'd out my Hands to it with eager
Wifhes. O happy Defart, faid I, I ftall never fee
thee more! O miferable Creature, faid. I, whi-
ther am I going; Then I reproach'd myfelf with
my unthankful Temper, and how I had repin'd at
my folitary Condition; and now what would I give
to be on Shore there again ? Thus we never fee
the true State of our Condition, till it is illuftrated
to us by its Contraries; nor know how to value
what we enjoy, but by the want of it. It is fcarce
poffible to imagine the Consternation I was now in,
being
being driven from my beloved Ifland (for fo it ap-
peared ro me now to be) into the wide Ocean, al- .
moft two Leagues, and in the utmoft*Defpair of
ever recovering it again. However, I work'd hard,
till indeed my Strength was almoft exhaufted, and
kept my Boat as much to the Northward, that is,
towards the Side of the Current which the Eddy
lay on, as poffibly I could ; when about Noon, as
the Sun pafs'd the Meridian, I thought I felt a lit-
tle J3reeze of Wind in my Face, fpringing up from
the S. S. E. This chear'd my Heart a little, and
efpecially when in about half an Hour more ic1
blew a pretty fmall gentle Gale. By this Time I
was gotten at a frightful Diftance from the Bland,
and had the leaft Cloud or hazy Weather interven'd,
I had been undone another Way too; for I had no
.Ccmj.afs on Board, and mould never have known
how to have fleered towards the Ifland, if I had
but once loft Sight of it ; but the Weather con-
tinuing clear, I apply'd myfelf to get up my Maft
again, fpread my Sail, /landing away to the North
as much as poffible, to get out of the Current.
Juft as I had fet my Maft and Sail, and the Boat
began to ftretch away, I faw even by the Clear-
nefs of the Water, fome Alteration of the Current
was near; for where the Current was fo ftrong, the
Water was foul; but perceiving the Water clear, I
found the Current abate, and prefently I found to
the JSaft, at about half a Mile, a Breach of the Sea
upon fome Rocks; thefe Rocks I found caus'd the
Current to part again, and as the main Strefs of it
ran .away more Southerly, leaving the Rocks to the
Nmth-Eaft; fo the other return'd by the Repulfeof
the Rocks, and made a ftrong Eddy, which fan
back again to the Nmtb-lVeft with a very {harp
Stream.

They who know what it is to have a Reprieve
brought to them upon the Ladder, or to be refcu-
ed from Thieves juft going t.p murder them, or
who have been in fuch like Extremities, may guefs
what my prefent Surprize of Joy was, and how glad-
ly I put my Boat into the Stream pf this Eddy, and
the Wind alfo fremning, how gladly I fpread my
Sail to it, running chearfully before the Wind, and
with a ftrong Tide or Eddy under Foot.
This Eddy carry'd me about a League in my
Way back again dire&ly towards the liland, but
about two Leagues more to the Northward than
the Current whiph carried me away at full; fo that
when I came near the Ifland, I found myfelf open
to the Northern Shore of it, that is to fay, the other
End of the Ifland oppofite to that which I went out
from.
When I had made fomething more thaft a League
pf Way by the Help of this Current or Eddy, I found
it was fpent and ferv'd me no farther. However, \
found that being between the two great Currents,
(viz,.) that on the South Side, which had hurried
me away, and that on the North, which lay about
a League on the other Side : I fay, between thefe
two, in the V/ake of the Ifland, I found the Water
at lea't /till and running no Way; and having {till a
Breeze of Wind fair for me, I kept on fleering di-
rectly for the Ifland, tho? not making fuch frefh Way
as I did before.
About four a-Clock in.the Evening, being then
within about a League of the Ifland, I found the
Point of the Rocks which occafion'd this Difafter,
Itretching out, as is defcribed before, to the Solith-
jvard, and carting off the Current more Southward-
ly, had cf courfe made another Eddy to the North,
arid this I found very ftrong, bat not dire&ly fctting
£he Way my Courfe lay, which was due Weft, but
almoft
almolt. full North. However, having*a frefh Gale,
I ftretch'd a-crofs this Eddy flanting North-weft,
and in about an Hour came within about a Mile
of the Shore, where it being fmooth Water, I foon
got to Land.
When I was on Shore I fell on my Knees and
gave God Thanks for my Deliverance, refolving '
to lay afide all Thoughts of my Deliverance by my
Boat; and refreming myfelf with fuch Things as"
I had, I brought my Boat clofe to the Shore in a
little Cove that I had fpy'd under fome Trees, and
laid me down to fleep, being quite fpent with the
Labour and Fatigue of the Voyage.
I was now at a great Lofs which Way to get
Home with my Boat : I had run fo much Hazard,
and knew too much the Cafe to think of attempt-
ing it by the Way I went out; and what might be
at the other Side, (I mean the Weft Side) 1 knew
not, nor had I any Mind to run any more Ventures,
fo I only refolved in the Morning to make my Way
Weft ward along the Sjiore, and to fe.e if there Vas
• no Creek where I might lay up my Frigate in Safe-
ty, fo as to have her again if I wanted her. In about
three Miles, or thereabout, coafting the Shore, I
came to a very good Inlet, or Bay, about a Mile over,
which narrowed till it came to a very little Rivulet
or Brook, where I found a very convenient Harbour
for my Boat, and where fhe lay as if fhe had been
in a little Dock made on purpofe for her. Here I
put in, and having fiow'd my Boat very fafe, I went
on Shore to look about me, and fee where 1 was,
I foon found I had but a little pafs'd by the Place
where I had been before, when I traveled on Foot
to that Shore ; fo taking nothing out of my Boat,
but my Gun and my Umbrella, for it was ex-
ceeding hot, I began my March. The Way was
comfortable enough after fuch a Voyage as I had
M 4 beea
•
been upon, and I reach'd my old Bower in the
Evening, where I found every thing Handing as I
left it; for I always kept it in good Order, being,
as I faid before, my Country-houfe.
I got over the Fence, and laid me down in the
Shade to reft my Limbs, for I was very weary, and
fell afleep : But judge you, if you can, that read my
'Story, what a Surprize I muft be in, when I was
wak'd out of my Sleep by a Voice calling me by
my Name feveral times, Robin, Robin, Robin Crufoe,
poor Rcbin Crufoe ! where are you Ribin Crujoe ?
_Where are you ? Where have you been ?
I was fo dead. afleep at firft, being fatigu'd with
Rowing, or Paddling, as it is cali'd, the firlt
Part or' the Day, and with Walking the latter Part,
that I did not wake thoroughly; but dozing be-
tween fleeping and waking, thought I dream'd
that fome body fpoke to me : But as the Voice
continu'd to repeat, Robin Crufoe, Rcbin Crttjoe, at
laft I began to wake more perfectly, .and was at
firft dreadfully frighted, and ftarted up in the ut-
moft Confternation : But no fooner were my Eyes
open, but I faw my Poll fitting on the Top of the
Hedge, and immediately knew that it was he that
fpoke to me; for juft in fuch bemoaning Language
I had ufed to talk to him, and teach him ; and he
had learn'd it fo perfedly, that he would fit upon
my Finger, and lay his Bill clcfe-to my Face, and
cry, Poor Robin Crufoe, Where are you ? Where have
you been ? How come you her? ? and fuch things as I
had taught him.
However, even though I knew it was the Parrot,
and that indeed it could be no body elfe, it was
a good while before I could compofe myfeM :
Firft, I was amazed how the Creature got thither,
and then how he fhould juft keep about the Place,
and &> where elfe ; But as I was well faris/ied it
: ' COlU4
could be no body but honeft Poff, I got it over;
and holding out my Hand, and calling him by his
Name Poll, the fociable Creature came to me, and
fat upon my Thumb, as he ufed to do, and conti-
nued talking to me, Poor Robin Crufoe, and bow
did I come here ? and where had I been ? juft as if he
had been overjoy'd to fee me again ; and fo I car-
ry 'd him Home along with me.
I had now had. enough of rambling to Sea for
fome time, and had enough to do for many Days
to fit ftill, and reflect upon the Danger I had been
in. I would have been very glad to have had
my Boat again on my Side of the liland ; but I
knew not how it was practicable to get it about
as to the Eaft Side of the Ifland ; which I had
gone round : I knew well enough there was no ven-
turing that Way ; my very Heart would fhrink, and
my very Blood run chill but to think of it : And as
to the other Side of the Ifland, I did not know
( how it might be there ; but fuppofing the Current
ran with the fame Force againft the Shore at the
Eaft, as it pafs'd by it on the other, I might run
the fame Risk of being driven down the Stream,
and carry'd by the Ifland, as I had been before, of
being carry'd away from it; fo with thefe Thoughts
I contented my felt to be without any Boat, tho'
it had been the Product of fo many Months La-
bour to make it, and of fo many more to get it
unto the Sea-
In this Government of my Temper I remain'd
near a Year, lived a very fedate retired Life, as
you may well fuppofc ; and n»y Thoughts being
very much compofed as to my Condition, and
fully comforted in refigning myfelf to the Dif-
pofitions of Providence, 1 thought I liv'd ceally ve-
ry happily in all things, except that of Society.
I im-
I improv'd my felt in this time in all the mecha-
nick Exercifes which my Neceffities put me upon
applying myfelf to, and I believe could, upon Qc-
caiion, have made a very good Carpenter, especially
confidering how few Tools I had.
Befides this, I arrived at an unexpected Per-
fection in my Earthen Ware, and contrived well
enough to make them with a Wheel, which I found
infinitely eafier and better ; "becaufe I made Things
round and fhapable, which before were filthy
Things indeed to look on. But I think I was ne-
ver more vain of my own Performance, or more
joyful for any Thing I found out, than for my be-
ing able to make a Tobacco-Pipe. And tho' it was
a very ugly clumfy Thing, when it was done, and
only burnt red like other Earthen Ware, yet as it
was hard and firm, and would draw the Smoke, I
was exceedingly comforted with it; for I had been
always ufcd to fmoke, and there were Pipes in the
Ship, but I forgot them at firft, not knowing that
there was Tobacco in the Ifland ; and afterwards,»
when I fearch'd the Ship again,' I could not come
at any Pipes at all.
In my Wicker Ware alfo I improved much, and
made abundance of neceflary Baskets, as well as
my Invention fhew'd me, though not very hand-
fome, yet they were fuch as were very handy and
convenient for my laying Things up in, of fetching
Things home in. For Example, if I kill'd a Goat
abroad, I could hang it up in a Tree, flea it, and
drcfs it, and cut it in Pieces, and bring it home in
a Basket; and th^e like by a Turtle, I could cut it
up, take out the Eggs, and a Piece or two of the
Flefh, which was enough for me, and bring them
home jn a Basket , and leave the reft behind
me. Alfo large deep Baskets were my Recei-
vers for my Corn., which I always rub'd out as

foon as it was dry, and cured, and kept it in great
Baskets.
I began now to perceive my Powder abated confi-
derably, and this was a want which it was im-
podible for me to fupply, and I began ferioufly to
confider what I muft do when I fhould have no
more Powder; that is to fay, how I fhould do to
kill any Goats. I had, as is obferv'd in the third
Year of my being here, kept a young Kid, and bred
her up tame, and I was in hopes of getting a He-
Goat, but I could not by any means bring it to
pafs, till my Kid grew an old Goat ; and I could
never find in my Heart to kill her, till fhe dy'd at
lafl of meer Age.
But being now in the eleventh Year of my Refi-
dence, and, as I have faid, my Ammunition grow-
ing low, I fet myfelf to ftudy fome Art to trap and
{hare the Goats, to fee whether I could not catch
fome of them alive, and particularly I wanted a She-
* Goat great with Young.
To this Purpofe I made Snares to hamper them,
and I do believe they were more than once taken
in them ; but my Tackle was not good, for I had
no Wire, and I always found them broken, and my
Bait devour'd.
At length I refolv'd to try a Pit-fall, fo I dug
feveral large Pits in the Earth, in Places where I
had obferv'd the Goats ufed to feed, and over thefe
Pits I phced Hurdles of my own making too,
with a. great Weight upon them; and feveral times
I put Ears of Barley and dry Rice, without fet-
ting the Trap, and I could eafily perceive that the
(Goats had gone in and eaten up the Corn, for I
could fee the Mark of their Feer. At length I fct
three Traps in one Night, and going the next
Morning I found them all {landing, and yet the
Bait eaten and gone. This was very difcouraging:
'How-
However, I alter'd my Trap, and, not to trouble
you with Particulars, going one Morning to fee my
Trap, I found in one of them a large old He-Goat,
and in one of the other three Kids, a Male, and
two Females.
As to the old one, I knew not what to do with
him, he was fo fierce I durft not go into the Pit to
him; that is to fay, to go about to bring him away
alive, which was what I wanted. I could have
kill'd him, but that was not my Bufinefs, nor would
it anfwer my End. So I e'en let him out, and he
ran away as if he had been frighted out of his
Wits: But I had forgot then what I learned af-
terwards, that Hunger will tame a Lion. If I
had let him flay there three or four Days without
Food, and then have carry'd him fome Water to
drink, and then a little Corn, he would have been
as tame as one of the Kids, for they are mighty
fagacious tractable Creatures where they are well •
ufed.
However, for the prefent I let him go, knowing
no better at that Time ; then I went to tlje three
Kids, and taking them one by one, I ty'd them
with Strings together, and with fome Difficulty
brought them all-Home.
It was a good while before they would feed, but
throwing them fome fwcet Corn, it tempted them,
and they began to be tame : and now 1 found that
if I expected to fupply myfelf with Goat-Flefh
when I had no Powder or.Shot left, breeding fome
up tame was my only Way, when perhaps I
might have them about my Houfe like a Flock of
Sheep.
. .But then it prefently occur'd to me, that I mutt
: keep the Tame from the Wild, oreSfe they would
always run wild when they grew up; and the only_
Way for this was to have fome enclofed Piece ot
,,i ? ' Ground,
Ground, well fenc'd either with Hedge or Pale, to .
keep them in fo effectually, that thofe within might
not break out, or thofe without break in.
This was a great Undertaking for one Pair of
Hands; yet as 1 faw there was an abfolute Necef-
fity of doing it, my firft Piece of Work was to
find out a proper Piece of Ground, viz.. where there
was likely to be Herbage for them to eat, Water
for them to drink, and Cover to keep them from the
Sun.
Thofe who underiland fuch Enclofures will think
I had very little Contrivance, when J pitch'd upon
a Place very proper for all thefe, being a plain
open piece of Meadow-Land or Savanna, (as our
People call it in the Weftern Colonies,) which had
two or three little Drills of frefh Water in it, and
at one end was very woody: I fay they will fmile
at my Forecaft, when I {hall tell them I began my
enclofing of this Piece of Ground in fuch a Man-
ner, that my Hedge or Pale muft have been at leaft
two Mile about. Nor was the Madnefs of it fo
great as to the Compafs, for if it was ten Mile
about I was like to have time enough to do it in.
But I did not confider that my Goats would be as
wild in fo much Compafs, as if they had had the
whole Ifland, and I Ihould have fo much Room
to chace them in, that I fhould never catch
them.
My Hedge was begun and carry'd on, I believe,
about fifty Yards, when this Thought occur'd to
me; fo I prefently ftopt fhort, and for the firft be-
ginning 1 refolv'd to enclofe a Piece of about ijo
Yards in length, and 100 Yards in breadth, which as
it would maintain as many as I ftould have in any
reafonable time, fo as my Flock encreafed, I could
add more Ground to my Enclofure.
This
This was acting with fome Prudence, and I went
to work with Courage. I was about three Months
hedging in the firft Piece, and till I had done it I
tether'd the three Kids in the bell part of it, and
us'd them to feed as near me as poffible to make
them familiar; and very often I would go and car-
ry them fome Ears of Barley, or a handful of Rice,
and feed them out of my Hand; fb that after my
Enclofure was finifhed, and I let them loofe, they
would follow me up and down, bleating after me
for a handful of Corn.
This anfwer'd my End, and in about a Year and
half I had a Flock of about twelve Goats, Kids
and all; and in two Years more I had three and
forty, befides feveral that I took and killed for my
Food. And after that I enclofed five feveral Pie-
ces of Ground to feed them in, with little Pens to
drive them into, to take them as I wanted, and
Gates out of one Piece of Ground into ano-
ther.
But this was not all, for now I not only had
Goats-Flefh to feed on when I pleas'd, but Milk
too, a thing which indeed in my beginning I did
not fo much as think of, and which, when it came
into my Thoughts, was really an agreeable Sur-
prize. For now I fet up my Dairy, and had fome-
times a Gallon or two of Milk in a Day. And as
Nature, who gives Supplies of Food to every
Creature, dictates even naturally how to make ufe
of it; fo I.that had never milk'd a Cow, much lefs.
a Goat, or feen Butter or Cheefe made, very rea-
dily and handily, tho' after a great many Eflays and
Mifcarriages, made me both Butter and Cheefe
at laft, and never wanted it afterwards.
How mercifully can our great Creator treat his
Creatures, even in thofe Conditions in which they
feem'd to be overwhelm'd in Deftruction! How.
can
can he fweeten the bittereft Providences, and give
us caufe to praife him for Dungeons and Prifons !
What a Table was here fpread for me in a Wilder-
nefs, where I faw nothing at firft but to perim for
Hunger! ,
It would have made a Stoick fmile to have feen
me and my little Family fit down to Dinner; there
was my Majefty the Prince and Lord of the whole
Itland ; 1 had the Lives-of all my Subje&s at my
abfoJute Command. I could hang, draw, give Li-
berty, and take it away, and no Rebels among all
my Subjects.
Then to fee how like a King I din'd too all
alone, attended by my Servants; Poll, as if he had
been my Favourite, was the only Perfon permit-
ted to talk to me. My Dog, who was now grown
very old and crazy, and had found no Species to
multiply his Kind upon, fat always at my Right
Hand ; and two Cats, one on one Side the Ta-
ble, and one on the other, expecting now and
then a Bit from my Hand, as a Mark of fpecial
Favour.
But thefe were not the two Cats which I brought
on Shore at firft, for they were both of them dead,
and had been interr'd near my Habitation by my
own Hand ; but one of them having multiply'd by *
I know not what Kind of Creature, thefe were
two which I had preferv'd tame, whereas the reft
run wild in the Woods, and became indeed trou-
blefome to me at laft ; for they would often come ;>.
into my Houfe, and plunder me too, till at laft I
was obliged to fhoot them, and did kill a great
many ; at length they left me with this Atten-. »
dance, and in this plentiful Manner I liv'd ; nei- .
ther could I be faid to want any thing but Society,
and of that in fome. time after "this I was like to
have too much.
I was
I was fomething impatient, as I have obferv'd,
to have the Ufe of my Boat; though very loth to
run any more Hazards; and therefore fometimes I
fat contriving Ways to get her about the Ifland,
and at other times I fat my felf down contented
enough without her. But* I had a flrange Uneafinefs
in my Mind to go down to the Point of the Ifland,
where, as I have faid, in my laft Ramble, I went up
the Hill to fee how the Shore lay, and how the Cur-
rent fet, that I might fee what I had to do: This
Inclination increas'd upon me every Day, and at
length I refolv'd to travel thither by Land ; follow-
ing the Edge of the Shore, I did fo : But had any
one in England been to meet fuch a Man as I was, it
muft either have frighted them, or rais'd a great
deal of Laughter ; and as I frequently flood Hill to
look at myfelf, I could not but fmile at the Notion
of my travelling through Torkflrire with fuch an E-
quipage, and in fuch a Drefs : Be pleas'd to take a
Sketch of my Figure as follows.
I had a great high fhapelefs Cap, made of a
Goat's Skin, with a Flap hanging down behind, as
well to keep the Sun from me, as to {hoot the Rain
oft from running into my Neck ; nothing being fo
hurtful in thefe Climates, as the Rain upon the
Flefh under the Cloaths.
I had a fhort Jacket of Goat-Skin, the Skirts co-
ming down to about the Middle of my Thighs ;
and a Pair of open-knee'd Breeches of the fame; the
Breeches were made of the Skin of an old He-goat,
whofe Hair hung down fuch a Length on either
Side, that like Pantaloons it reach'd to the Middle ot
my Legs; Stockings and Shoes I had none, but had
made me a Pair of fome-things, I fcarce know
what to call them, like Buskins, to flap over my
Legs, and lace on either Side like Spatter-dafties;
but
but of a moft barbarous Shape, as indeed were all
the reft of my Cldaths.
I had on a broad Belt of Goat's-Skin dry'd,
which I drew together with two Thongs of the
fame, inftead of Buckles, and in a kind of a Frog
on either Side of this. Inftead of a Sword and a
Dagger, hung a little Saw and a Hatchet, one on
one Side, one on the other. I had another Beit
not fo broad, and faften'd in the fame Manner,
which hung over my Shoulder; and at the End ot
it, under my left Arm hung two Pouches, both
made of Goat's-Skin too; in one of which hung
my Powder, in the other my Shot: At my Back I
carried my Basket, on my Shoulder my Gun, and
over my Head a great clumfy ugly Goat-Skin Um-
brella, but which, after all, was the moft neceffary
Thing I had about me, next to my Gun ; As for
my Face, the Colour of it was really not fo Moletta
like as one might expect from a Man not at all care-
ful of it, and living within nineteen Degrees of the
Equinox. My Beard I had once fufter'd to grow till
it was about a quarter of a Yard long; but as I had
both Sciflarsand Razors fufficient, I had cat it pret-
ty fliort, except what grew. on my upper Lip, which
I had trim'd into a large Pair of Mahometan VVhif-
kers, fuch as I had feen worn by fome 'Turks, who I
faw at Sails, for the Moors did not wear fuch, tho'
the Turks did; of thefe Mufchatoes or Whiskers,. I
will not fay they were long enough to hang my Hat
upon them; but they were of a Length and Shape
monftrous enough, and fuch as in England would
h:ive pafs'd for frightful.
But all this is by the by; for as to my Figure, I
had fo few to obferve me, that it was of no man-
ner of Confequence ; fo I fay no more to that Part.
In this kind of Figure I went my new Journey, and
was out five or fix Days. I travel'd firft along the
N Sea-
Sea-Shore, directly to the Place where I firft brought
my Boat to an Anchor, to get up upon the Rocks;
and having no Beat now to take care of, I went over
the Land a nearer Way, to the fame Height that
I was upon before; when looking forward to the
Point of the Rocks which lay out, and which I was
oblig'd to double with my Boat, as is faid above,
I was furpriz'd to fee the Sea all fmooth and quiet,
no Ripling, no Motion, no Current, any more there
than in other Places.
I was at a ftrange Lofs to underftand this, and
refolv'd to fpend fome Time in the obferving ir, to
fee if nothing from the Sets of the Tide had occa-
fion'd it; but I was prefently convinced how it was,
•viz,. That the Tide of Ebb fetting from the Weft,
and joyning with the Current of Waters from fome
great River on the Shore, muft be the Occafion of
this Current; and that according .is the Wind blew
more forcibly from the Weft, or from the North,
this Current came near, or went farther from the
Shore; for waiting thereabouts till Evening, I went
up to the Rock again, and then the Tide of Ebb
being made, I plainly faw the Current again as be-
fore, only, that it run farther off, being near half a
League from the Shore; whereas in my Cafe, it
fet clofe upon the Shore, and hurried me aud my
Canoe along with it, which at another Time it
would not have done.
This Obfervation convinc'd me, That I hail no-
thing to do but to obferve the Ebbing and the
Flowing of the Tide, and I might very eafiiy bring
my Boat about the Ifland again : But when 11 «•
gau to think of putting it in Practice, I had fuch a
Terror upon my Spirits at the Remembrance c<t
ii •»"•* <•>••• * .. f «» ..I.1., t *
the Danger I had been in, that I could not think1,
of it again with any Patience; b.ut on the contrary,
I took up another Refolution, which was more fafe,
though mote laborious; and this was, That I
would build, or rather make me another Pariagua
or Canoe; and fo have one for one Side of the Id and,
and one for the other.
You are to underftand, that now I had, as t
may call it^ two Plantations in the Ifland; one my
little Fortification or Tent, with the Wall about
it under the Rock, with the Cave behifid me^
which by this Time I had enlarg'd into feveral
Apartments or Caves, one within another. One
of thefe, which was the dryeft, aod largeft, and
had a Door out beyond my Wail or Fortification;
that is to fey, beyond where my Wall joyn'd to
the Rock, was all fill'd up with the large Earthen
Pots, of which I have given an Account,. and with1
fourteen or fifteen great Baskets, which would hold
five or fix Bufhels eaehj where I laid up my Stores
of Provifion, efpecially my Corn, foirie in the Ear
cut off fhort from the Straw, and the other rub'd
out with my Hand.
As for my Wall made, as before-^ with long Stakel
bt PileSj thdfc Piles grevtr all like Trees, and were
by this Time grown fo big* and fpread fo very
much, that there was not the leaft Appearance to'
any one's View of any Habitation behind them.
Near this Dwelling of mine, but a little farther
within the Land, and upon lower Ground, lay my
two Pieces of Corn-Ground, which I kept duly
cultivated and fow'd, and which duly yielded me
their Harveft in its Seafon; and whenever I had
oceafion for more Corn, I had more Land adjoyn-
ing as fit as that.
Befides this, I had my Country Seat, and I hadl
now a tolerable Plantation there alfo; for firft, I
had ray little Bower, as 1 call'd it, which I kept'
in Repair) that is to fay, I kept the Hedge which
circled it in> conftantly fitted up to its ufual Height,
N * the
-•
.••
the Ladder {landing always in the Infide; I kept
the Trees which at firft were no more than my
Stakes, but were now grown very firm and tall; I
kept them always fo cut, that they might fpread and
grow thick and wild, and make the more agreeable
Shade, which they did effectually to my Mind. In
the Middle of this I had my Tent always ftanding,
being a piece of a Sail fpread over Poles fet up for
that Purpofe, and which never wanted any Repair
or Renewing ; and under this I had made me a Squab
or Couch, with the Skins of the Creatures I had
kill'd, and with other foft Things, and a Blanket
laid on them, fuch as belong'd to our Sea-Bedding,
which I had faved, and a great Watch-Coat to
cover me ; and here, whenever I had Occafion to
be abfent from my chief Seat, I took up my Coun-
try Habitation.
Adjoyning to this I had my Enclofures for my
Cattle, that is to fay, my Goats: And as I had taken
an inconceivable deal of Pains to fence and enclofe
this Ground, fo I was fo uneafy to fee it kept entire,
left the Goats fhould break thro', that I never left
off till with infinite Labour I hadftuck the Outfide
of the Hedge fo full offmall Stakes, and fo near to
one another, that it was rather a Pale than a Hedge,
and there was fcarce Room to put a Hand thro
between them, which afterwards when thofe Stakes
grew, as they all did in the next rainy Seafon, made
the Enclofure ftrong like a Wall, indeed ftronger
than any Wall. •
This will teftify for me that I was not idle,
and that I fpared no Pains to bring to pafs what-
ever appear'd neceflary for my comfortable Sup-
port ; for I confider'd the keeping up a Breed or
tame Creatures thus at my Hand, would be a li-
ving Magazine of Flefh, Milk, Butter and Cheefe,
for
for me as long as I liv'd in the Place, if it were to be
forty Years, and that keeping them in my Reach,
•depended entirely upon my perfecting my Enclo-
fures to fuch a Degree, that I might be fure of
keeping them together; which by this Method in-
deed I fo effectually fecur'd, that when thefe lit-
tle Stakes began to grow, I had planted them fo
very thick, I was forced to pull fome of them up
again.
In this Place alfo I had my Grapes growing,
which I principally depended on for my Winter
Store of Raifins, and which I never fail'd to pre-
ferve very carefully, as the beft and moft agreeable
Dainty of my whole Diet ; and indeed 'they were
not agreeable only, but phyfical, wholefome, nou-
rifhing and refreming to the laft Degree. *
As this was alfo about half Way between my o-
ther Habitation and the Place where I had laid up
my Boat, I generally ftay'd, and lay here in my
Way thither; for I ufed frequently to vifit my
Boat, and I kept all things about or belonging to
her in very good Order; fometimes I went out in
her to divert my felfj but no more hazardous
Voyages would I go, nor fcarce ever above a
Stone's Caft or two from the Shore, I was fo appre-
henfive of being hurried out of my Knowledge a-
gain by the Currents or Winds, or any other Acci-
dent : But now I come to a new Scene of my Life.
It happen'd one Day about Noon going towards
my Boat, I was exceedingly furpriz'd with the Print
of a Man's naked Foot on the Shore, which was
very plain to be feen in the Sand : I flood like one
Thunder-ftruck, or as if I had feen an Apparition;
I liften'd, I look'd round me, I could hear nothing,
nor fee any Thing; I went up to a rifing Ground to
look farther ; I went up the Shore and down the
Shore, but it was all one, I could fee no other
N 3 Impreffion
Impreflion but that one, I went tp it again to fe?
jf there were any more, and to obferve if it might
not be my Fancy; but there was no Room for
that, for there was exactly the very Print of a Foot,
Toe?, Heel, and every fart of a Foot; how it
came thither, I knew not, nor could in the leaft
imagine. But after innumerable fluttering Thoughts,
like a Man perfectly cpnfus'd and out of myfelf, I
came Home to my Fortification) not feeling, as we
fay, the Ground I went on, but terrify.d to the laft ,
Degree, looking behind me at every twp or three I
Seeps, miftaking every Bufh and Tree, and fancy-
ing every Stump at a Diilance to be a Man; nor is
it poffible to defcribe how many various Shapes af-
frighted Imagination reprefented Things to me in;
how many wild Ideas were found every Moment
in my Fancy, and what ftrange unaccountable
Whimfies came into my Thoughts by the Way.
' When I came to my Caftle, for fo I think I call'd
it ever after this, I fled into it like one purfued;
whether 1 went over by the Ladder as firft con-
triv'd, or went in at the Hole in the Rock, which
J call'd a Poor, I cannot remember; no, nor could
I remember the next Morning; for never frighted
Hare fled to Cover, or Fox to Earth, with more
Terror of Mind than I to this Retreat.
I flept none that Night; the farther I was from
the Occafion of my Fright, the greater my Ap1
prehehfions were; which is fomething contrary to
the Nature of fuch Things, and efpecially to the
ufual Practice of all preatures in Fear: But I was
fo embarrafs'd with my own frightful Ideas of the
*Thing, that I form'd nothing but difmal Imagina-
tions to rhyfeif", even tho' I was now a great way
'pff it. Sometimes I fancy<I it m»ft be the De-
yil; and Reafon joyn'd in with me upon this Sup-
pofition: For how fhould any other Thirg in hu-
mane
[
mane Shape come into the Place ? Where was the
Veflel that brought them ? What Marks was there
of" any other Footfteps ? And how was it poflible
a Man fhould come there ? But then to think that
Satan fhould take humane Shape upon him in fuch a
Place where there could be no manner of Occafion
for it, but to leave the Print of his Foot behind
him, and that even for no Purpofe too, for he could
not be fure I fhould fee it; this was an Amufement
the other Way : I confidered that the Devil might
have found out abundance of other Ways to have
terrify'd me than this of the fingle Print of a Foot.
That as I liv'd quite on the other Side of the Ifland,
he would never have been fo fimple to leave a Mark
in a Place where it was ten Thoufand to one whe-
ther I fhould ever fee it or not, and in the Sand
too, which the firft Surge of the Sea upon a high
Wind would have defac'd entirely : All this feem'd
inconfiftent with the Thing itfelf, and with all the
- Notions we ufually entertain of the Subtilty of the
Devil.
Abundance of fuch Things as thefe affifted to ar-
gue me out of all Apprehenfions of its being the
Devil: And I prefently concluded then, that it muft
be fome more dangerous Creature, viz.. That it
muft be fome of the Savages of the main Land
over-againft me, who had wandered out to Sea in
their Canoes, and either driven by the Currents, or
by contrary Winds, had made the Ifland ; and had
been on Shore, but were gone away again to Sea,
being as loth, perhaps, to have ftaid in this defo-
late Ifland, as I would have been to have had them.
While thefe Reflections were rolling upon my
Mind, I was very thankful in my Thoughts, that
I was fo happy as not to be thereabouts at that
Time, or that they did not fee my Boat, by which
they would have concluded that fome Inhabitants
N 4 had
had been in the Place, and perhaps have fearch'd
farther for me : Then terrible Thoughts rack'd my
Imagination about their having found my Boat,
and that there were People here; and that if fo, I
fhould certainly have them come again in greater
Numbers and devour me ; that if it mould happen
Co that they mould not find me, yet they would
find my Enclofure, deflroy all my Corn, carry away
ill my Flock of tame Goats, and I fhould perifh at
aft for meer Want.
Thus my Fear banifh'd all my Religious Hope,
ill that former Confidence in God, which was
founded upon fuch wonderful Experience as I had
riad of his Goodnefs, now vanifh'd; as if he that
ud fed me by Miracle hitherto, could not preferve
jy his Power the Provifion which he had made for
ne by his Goodnefs : I reproach'd my felf with my
Eafinefs, that would not fow any more Corn one
Year than would juft ferve me till the next Seafon,
is if no Accident could intervene to prevent my
enjoying the Crop that was upon the Ground ;
ind this I thought fo ju/l a Reproof, that I refolv'd
"or the future to have two or three Years Corn be-
bre-hand, fo that whatever might come, I might
lot perifh for want of Bread.
How ftrange a Chequer-Work of Providence is
•he Life of Man! and by what fecret differing
Springs are the Affections hurried about, as differ-
ng Circumftances prefent! To Day we love what
o Morrow we hate ; to Day we feek what to Mor-
•ow we fhun ; to Day we defire what to Morrow
ve fear; nay, even tremble at the Apprehenfions of,
This was exemplified in me at this time in the
noft lively Manner imaginable; for I, whofe only
^.ffliaion was, that I feem'd banifh'd from humane
Society, that I was alone circumfcrib'd by the
(oundlefs Ocean, cut off from Mankind, and con-
demn'd.
demn'd to what I call .filent Life; that I was as
one whom Heaven thought not worthy to be num-
ber'd among the Living, or to appear among the
reft of his Creatures ; that to have feen one of my
own Species, would have feem'd to me a Raifing
me from Death to Life, and the greateft Blefllng
that Heaven it felf, next to the fupreme Blefling of
Salvation, could beftow; I fay, that I fhould now
tremble at the very Apprehenfions of feeing a Man,
and was ready to fink into the Ground at but the
Shadow, or filent Appearance of a Man's having
fet his Foot on the Bland.
Such is the uneven State of Humane Life; and it
afforded me a great many curious Speculations af-
terwards, when I had a little recovered my firft
Surprize ; I confidered that this was the Station of
Lifej the infinitely wife and good Providence of
God had determm'd for me, that as I could not
forefee what the Ends of Divine Wifdom might be
in all this, fo I was not to difpute his Sovereignty,
who, as I was his Creature, had an undoubted
Right by Creation to govern and difpofe of me ab-
folutely as he thought fit ; and who, as I was a
Creature who had offended him, had likewife a ju-
dicial Right to condemn me to whaj: Punifhment
he thought fit; and that it was my part to fubmit
to bear his Indignation, becaufe I had fin'd againft
him.
I then reflected, that God, who was not only
Righteous but Omnipotent, as he had thought
fit thus to punifh and afRicT: me, fo he was able
to deliver me ; that if he did not think fit to do it,
'twas my unqueftion'd Duty to refign my felf abfo-
lutely and entirely to his Will : And on the other
hand, it was my Duty alfo to hope in him, pray
to him, and quietly to attend the Dictates and Di-
j-e&ions of his daily Providence.
Thefe
Thefe Thoughts took me up many Hours, Days,
nay, I may fay, Weeks and Months; and one par-
ticular Efted of my Cogitations on this Occafion,
I cannot omit, viz.. One Morning early, lying in
my Bed, and fill'd with Thought about my Danger
from the Appearance of Savages, I found it dif-
compos'd rae very much; upon which thofe Words
of the Scripture came into my Thoughts, Call up-
on me in the Day of "Trouble, and I will deliver, and that
Jbalt glorify me.
Upon this, rifing chearfully out of my Bed, my
Heart was not only comforted, but I was gujded
and encouraged to pray earneftly to God for Deli"
verance : When I had done praying, I took up my
Bible, and opening it to read, the firft Words that
presented to me, were, Wait on the Lord, and be of
good Cheer, and be Jball ftrengthea thy Heart; -wait, 1
fay, on the Lord. It is impoffible to exprefs the Com-
fort this gave me. In Anfwer, I thankfully laid
down the Book, and was no more fad, at leaft, not
on that Occafion.
In the middle of thcfe Cogitations, Apprehcn-
fions and Reflections, it came into my Thought one
Day, that all this might be a meer Chimera of my
own; and that this Foot might be the Print of my
own Foot, when I came on Shore from my Boat:
This chear'd me up a little too, and I began to per-
fwade myfelf it was all a-Delation ; that it was no-
thing elfe but my owflToot; and why might not I
come that Way^fom the Boat, as well as I was go-
ing that Way t(f the Boat ? Again, I confider'd alfo
that I could byino Means tell for certain where I
had trod, and w$ere I had not; and that if at laft
this was only the Print of my own Foot, I had
play'd the Part of thofe Fools, who ftrive to make
Stories of Spe&res and Apparitions, and then are
frighted at them more than any body.
Now
INfow I began to take Courage, and to peep abroad
again; for I had not ftir'd out of my Caftle for three
Pays and Nights; fo that I began to ftarve for
Provifion; for I had little or nothing within Doors,
but fome Barley Cakes and Water. Then I knew
that my Goats wanted to be milk'd too, which
ufually was my Evening Diverfion; and the poor
Creatures were in great Pain and Inconvenience for
want of it; and indeed, it almoft fpoil'd fome of
them, and almoft dry'd up their Milk.
Heartning myfelf therefore with the Belief that
this ;was nothing but the Print of one of my own
Feet*and fo I might be truly faid to ftart at my
own Shadow, I began to go abroad again, and
went to my Country Houfe, to milk my Flock ; but
to fee with what Fear I went forward, how often I
look'd behind me, how I was ready every now and
then to lay down my Basket, and run for my Life, it
would have made any one have thought I was haunt-
ed with an evil Conference, or that I had been late-
ly moft terribly frighted, and fo indeed I had.
However, as I went down thus two or three
Days, and having feen nothing, I began to be a lit-
tle bolder; and to think there was really nothing in
it, but my own Imagination: But I could not per-
fwade myfelf fully of this, till I {hould go down to
the Shore again, and fee this Print of a Foot, and
meafure it by my own, and fee if there was any Si-
militude or Fitnefs, that I might be aflur'd it was
my own Foot: But when I came to the Place,
Ftrft, it appeared evidently to me, that when I laid
up my Boat, I could not poflibly be on Shore any
where thereabout. Secondly, When I came to mea-
{ure the Mark with my own Foot, I found my Foot
hot fo large by a great deal; both thefe Things filTd
my Head with new Imaginations, and gave me the
Vapours again to the higheft Degree; fo that I
(hook
fhook with Cold, like one in an Ague ; and I went
Home again, fill'd with the Belief" that fome Man
or Men had been on Shore there ; or, in fhort, that
the Itland was inhabited, and I might be furpriz'd
before I was aware; and what Courfe to take for
my Security, I knew not.
O what ridiculous Refolutions Men take, when
poflefs'd with Fear! it deprives them of the Ufeof
thofe Means which Reafon offers for their Relief.
The firft Thing I propos'd to my felf, was, to
throw down my Enclofures, and turn all my tame
Cattle wild into the Woods, that the Enemy might
not find them, and then frequent the Ifland in prof-
pea of the fame, or the like Booty ; then to the
fimple Thing of Digging up my two Corn-Fields,
that they might not find fuch a Grain there, and
ftill be prompted to frequent the Ifland; then to de-
molifh my Bower and Tent, that they might not
fee any Veftiges of Habitation, and be prompted to
look further, in order to find out the Perfons in-
habiting.
Thefe were the Subject of the firft Night's Cogi-
tation, after I was come home again, while the
Apprehenfions which had fo over-run my Mind
were frefli upon me, and my Head was full of Va-
pours, as above. Thi* Fear of Danger is ten thou-
{"and times more terrifying than Danger it felt,
when apparent to the Eyes ; and we find the Bur-
then of Anxiety greater by much, than the Evil
which we are anxious about; and, which was worfe
than all this, I had not that Relief in this Trouble
from the Refignation I ufed to pra&ife, that I
hop'd to have. I look'd, I thought, like Saul, who
complain'd not only that the Philiftinei were upon
him, but that God had forfaken him; for I did not
now take due Ways to compofe my Mind, by crying
to God in my Diftrefs, and refting upon his Provi-
dence,
dence, as I had done before, for my Defence and
Deliverance; which if I had done, I had, atleaft,
been more cheerfully fupported under this new Sur-
prize, and perhaps carry'd through it with more Re-
folution.
This Confufion of my Thoughts kept me waking
all Night; but in the Morning I fell afleep, and
having, by the Amufement of my Mind, been as it
were tired, and my Spirits exhaufted, I flept very
foundly, and wak'd much better compos'd than
I had ever been before : and now I began to think
fedately; and upon the utmjpft Debate with my-
felf, I concluded, That this Ifland, which was fo
exceeding pleafant, fruitful, and no farther from the
main Land than as I had feen, was not fo entirely
abandon'd as .1 might imagine : That altho' there
were no ftated Inhabitants who liv'd on the Spot;
yet that there might fometimes come Boats off from
the Shore, wha either with Defign, or perhaps ne-
ver, but when they were driven by crofs Winds,
might come to this Place.
That I had liv'd here fifteen Years now, and had
not met with the leaft Shadow or Figure of any
People yet; and that if at any Time they fhould be
driven here, it was probable they went away again
as foon as ever they could, feeing they had never
thought fit to fix there upon any Occafion, to this
Time.
That the moft I cou'd fuggeft any Danger from,
was, from any fuch cafual accidental Landing of
ftraggling People from the Main, who, as it,was
likely if they were driven hither, were here againft
their Wills ; fo they made no ftay here, but went off
again with all poffible Speed, feldom flaying one
Night on Shore, left they fcould not have the
Help of the Tides, and Day-light back again; and
that therefore I had nothing to dp but to confider.
of
of fome fafe Retreat, in eafe I fhould fee any Sa-
vages land upon the Spot.
Now I began forely to repent, that I had dug
my Cave fo large* as to bring a Door through
again, which Door, as I faid, came out beyond where
my Fortification joyn'd to the Rock: upon mature-
ly confidering this therefore, I refolv'd to draw me
a fecond Fortification, in the fame Manner of a
Semicircle, at a Diftanee from my Wall, juft where
I had planted a double Row of Trees, about twelvs
Years before, of which I made mention: Thefe
Trees having been planted fo thick before, they
wanted but a few riles to be driven between
them, that they fiiould be thicker, and ftronger,
and my Wall would be foon finifh'd.
So that I had now a double Wall* and my outer
Wall was thickned with Pieces of Timber, old Ca-
bles, and every Thing I could think of to make it
ftrong; having in it feven little Holes, about as
big as I might put my Arm out at. In the Infide
of this, I thickned my Wall to above ten Foot
thick, with continual bringing Earth out of my
Cave, and laying it at the Foot of the Wall, and
walking upon it; and through the feven Holes, I
contriv'd to plant the Mufquets, of which I took
Notice, that I got feven on Shore out of the Ship;
thefe, I fay, I planted like my Cannon, and fitted
them into Frames that held them like a Carriage,
that fo I could fire all the feven Guns in two Mi-
nutes time: This Wall I was many a weary Month
a finifhing, and yet never thought myfelf fafe till it
was done. .
When this was done, I ftuck all the Ground
without my Wall, for a great way every way, as
full with Stakes or Sticks of the 0/fcr-like Wood,
which I found fo apt to grow, as they could well
ftand; infomuch, that I believe I might fet in near
twenty
twenty thoufand of them, leaving a pretty large
Space between them and my Wai], that I might
have room to fee an Enemy, and they might have
no Ihelter from the young Trees, if they attempted
to approach my outer Wall.
Thus in two Years time I had a thick Grove,
and in five or fix Years time I had a Wood before
my Dwelling, growing fo monftrous thick and
ilrong, that it was indeed perfectly impaflkble;
and no Men, of what kind foever, would ever ima-
gine that there was any Thing beyond it, much le&
a Habitation. As for the Way which I propofed to
myfelf to go in and out, for I left no Avenue, it
was by fetting two Ladders; one to a Part of the
Rock which was low, and then broke in, and left
xoom to place another Ladder upon that; fo when
the two Ladders were taken down, no Man living
could come down to me without mifchiefing him-
felf; and if they had come down, they were ftifl
on the Out-fide of my outer Wall.
Thus I took all the Meafures humane Prudence
could fuggeft for my own Prefervation; and it will
be feen at length, that they were not altogether
without juft Reafon; though I forefaw nothing at
that Time, more than my meer Fear fuggefied to
me.
While this was doing, I was not altogether cate-
lefs of my other Affairs; for I had a great Concern
upon me for my little Herd of Goats; they were
not only a prefent Supply to me upon every Occa-
fion, and began to be Sufficient to me, without the
Expence of Powder and Shot; but alfo without the
Fatigue of Hunting after the wild ones; and I was
loth to lofe the Advantage of them, and to have
them all to nurfe up over again.
To this Purpofe, after long Confideration, I
could think of but two Ways to preferve them;
one
one was to find another convenient Place to dig a
Cave under Ground, and to drive them into it every
Night; and the other was to enclofe two or three
little Bits of Land, remote from. one another, and as
much conceal'd as I could, where I might keep about
half a Dozen young Goats in each Place: So
that if any Difafter happen'd to the Flock in gene-
ral, I might be able to raife them again with little
Trouble and Time: And this, tho' it would re-
quire a great deal of Time and Labour, I thought
was the moft rational Defign.
Accordingly I fpent fome Time to find out the
moft retir'd Parts of the Ifland; and I pitch'd up-
on one which was as private indeed as my Heart
could wifh for; it was a little damp Piece of Ground
in the middle of the Hollow and thick Woods,
where, as is obferv'd, I almoft loft myfelf once be-
fore, endeavouring to come back that Way from the
Eaftern Part of the Ifland : Here I found a clear
Piece of Land near three Acres, fo furrounded with
Woods, that it was almoft an Enclofure by Nature,
at leaft it did not want near fo much Labour to
make it fo, as the other Pieces of Ground I had
work'd fo hard at.
I immediately went to work with this Piece of
Ground, and in lefs than a Month's Time, I had
fo fenc'd it round, that my Flock or Herd, call it
which you pleafe, who were not fq wild now as at
firft they might be fuppofed to" be,' were well
enough fecur'd in it. So without any farther De-
lay, I removed ten young She-Goats and two He-
Goats to this Piece; and when they were there, I
continu'd to perfect the Fence till I had made it
as fecure as the other, which, however, I did at
more Leifure, and it took me up more Time by a
great deal,' AU
All this Labour I was at the Expence of, purely
from my Apprchenfions on the Account of the Print
<3f a Man's Foot which I had feen ; for as yet I
•never faw any human Creature come near the Kland,
and I had now liv'd two Years under thefe Unea-
finefles, which indeed made my Life much lefs
comfortable than it was before; as may well be
imagin'd by any who know what it is to live in
the conftant Snare of the Fear of Man; and this I
muft obferve with Grief too, that the Difcompo-
fure of nly Mind had too great Imprcffions alfo up-
on the religious Part of my Thoughts, for the
Dread and Terror of falling into the Hands of Sa-
vages and Canibals, lay fo upon my Spirits, that
I feldom found my felf in a due Temper for Appli-
cation to' my Maker, at leaft, not with the fedate
Calmnefs and Refignation of Soul which t was
wont to do ; I rather pray'd to God as under
great Affliction and Preflure of Mind, furrounded
with Danger, • and in Expectation every Night of
Being murder'd and devour'd before Morning ;
and I muft teftify from my Experience, that a Tem-
per of PeaCe, Thankfulnefs, Love and Aftection, is
much more the proper Frartle for Prayer, than that
of Terror and Difcompofure; and that under the
Dread of Mifchief irtipending, a Man is no more
fit for a comforting Performance of the Duty of
praying to God, than he is for Repentance on a
jfick-Bcd : For thefe Difcompofures aflfect the Mind
as the others do the Body ; and the Difcompofure
of the Mind muft neceflarily be as great a Difabi-
llty as that of the Body, and much greater pray-
ing to God being properly an Act of the Mind, not
of the Body.
But to go on : After 1 had thus fecur'd'one Part
of my little living Stock, I went about the whole
HUnd, fcarehing for another private Place, to make
O •. • fuch
fuch another Depofit; when wandring more to the
Weft Point of the Ifland than I had ever done yet,
and looking out to Sea, I thought I faw a Boat up-
on the Sea, at a great Diftance ; I had found a Pro-
fpective-Glafs, or two, in one of the Seamen's
Chefts, which I fav'd out of our Ships; but I had
it not about me, and this was fo remote, that Icould
not tell what to make of it ; though I look'd at it
till my Eyes were not able to hold to look any
longer : whether it was a Boat, or not, I do not
know ; but as I defcended from the Hill, I could
fee no more of it, fo I gave it over ; only I refolv'd
to go no more out without a Profpe&ive-Glafs in
my Pocket.
When I was come down the Hill, to the End of
the Ifland, where indeed I had never been before,
I was prefently convinc'd, that the feeing the Print
of a Man's Foot, was not fuch a ftrange Thing in
the Ifland as I imagin'd ; and but that it was a fpe-
cial Providence that I was ca.il upon the Side of the
Ifland where the Savages never came, I fhould ea-
iily have known, that nothing was more frequent
than for the Canoes from the Main, when they hap-
pen'd to be a little too far out at Sea, to fhoot over
to that Side of the Ifland for Harbour; likewife as
they often met, and fought in their Canoes, the Vic-
tors having ta.ken any Prifoners, would bring them
over to this Shore, where, according to their dread-
ful Cuftoms, being all Canibals, they would kill and
cat them; of which hereafter.
When I was come down the Hifl to the Shore,
as I faid above, being the S. TV. Point ^of the
Jfland, I was perfectly con founded and amaz'dj nor
is it poflibJe for me to exprefs the Horror of n»/
Mind, at feeing the Shore fpread with Skulls,
Hands, Feet and other Bones of humane Bodies ;
and particularly I obferv'd a Place where there had
* been
 •been,a Fire made, and a Circle dug in th^ Eafthj'
like a Cockpit, where it is fuppofed the Savage
Wretches had fat down to their inhumane Feaft-
ings upon the Bodies of their Fellow-Creatures.
I was fo aflonifh'd'with the Sight of thefe Things,
that I entertain'd no Notions of any Danger to my
felf from it for a long while ; all "my Apprehen-
fions were buried in the Thoughts of fuch a Pitch of
inhumane, hellifh Brutality, and the Horror of the
^Degeneracy of Humane Nature ; which though I
.j^a,d heard of often, yet I never had fo near a View o)f
before; in fhcrt, I turn'd away my Face from the
.horrid Spectacle j my Stomach grew fick, and I
..was juil.at the point of Fainting, when Nature dii-
charg*4.ithe Diforder from my Stomach; and ha-
ving vpmited with an uncommon Violence, I was
a little reliev'd, but could not bear to ftay in the
!Place a Moment ; fo I got me up the Hill again
-.wjth ^11 the Speed I could, and.walked on towards
j^y.Qwft Habitation.,. r j ; ,;, ; y/. . •. ^
When I camera, little out of that '.part of the
Ifland, I flood ftili awhile as amaz'd'j and then re-
cotfeiing myfelf, I.look'd up with the utmoft Affec-
i..qri my Sowl* and .with a Flpo4 of Tears in my
2 God; Thanks, that ha^ ctaft my firft Lot
jf th^ World, where I w.as djftinguifhd
,^,^_,- -^ dreadful Creatures a^ thefe ;. ^and • tha.t
though I had efte.emed my pre^fent. Condition, very
.-imifcrable, had yet given me fo many.Comforts iji
it,, that I had ftill more to give thanks.jfo,r than ^)
cowpkin ofj and this above all^thaf J had even
in this miferabl^e Condition been .comforted witji
.. the .KnovvJedge of himfelf, and the H,ope of h(s
.. Bleging, which was a Felicity more than fuffieienij*
ly equivalent.to all the Mifery which I
 In this Frame of Thankfulnefs, I went Home to
my Gallic, and began to be much eafier now, as
to the Safety of my Circumftances, than ever I was
before ; for I obferv'd that thefe Wretches never
came to this Ifland in fearch of what they could
get ; perhaps not feeding, nor wanting, or not ex-
pecting any thing here ; and having often, no doubt,
been up in the cover'd woody Part of it, without
finding any Thing to their Purpofe. I knew I had
been here now almoit eighteen Years, and never
faw the leaft Footfteps of Humane Creature there
before ; and I might be here eighteen more, as en-
tirely conceal'd, as I was now, if I did not difcover
my felf to them, which I had no manner of Occa-
iion to do, it being my only Bufinefs to keep my
felf entirely concealed where I was, unlefs I found
a better fort of Creatures than Canibals to make my
fell" known to.
Yet I entertain'd fuch an Abhorrence of the Sa-
vage Wretches that I have been fpeaking of, and of
the wretched inhumane Cuftom of their devouring
and eating one another up, that I continu'd penfive,
and fad, and kept clofe within my own Circle
for almoft two Years after this : When I fay my
own Circle, I mean by it, my three Plantations,
vis., my Caftle, my Country-Seat, which I cali'd
my Bower, and my Enclofure in the Woods ; nor
did I look after this for any other Ufe than as an
Enclofure for my Goats ; for the Averfion which
Nature gave me to thefe heilifh Wretches, was
fuch, that I was fearful of feeing them, as of feeing
the Devil himielf ; nor did I fo much as go to look
ifter my Boat in all this time, but began rather
:o think of making me another; for I could not
rhink of ever making any more Attempts to bring
:he other Boat round the Ifland to me, left .I
Jiould meet with fome of thefe Creatures at Sea,
w
in which, if I had happen'd to have fallen into their
Hands, I knew what would have been my Lot.
Time however, and the Satisfaction I had, that
1 was in no Danger of being difcovered by thefe
People, began to wear ofl" my Uneafinefs about
them; and I began to live juft in the fame compos'd
Manner as before; only with this Difference, that
I ufed more Caution, and kept my Eyes more about
me than I did before, left I (hould happen to
jbe feen by any of them; and particularly, I was
jnore cautious of firing my Gun, left any of them
being on the Ifland, fliould happen to hear of it;
and it was therefore a very good Providence to me,
that I had furniflrd myfelf. with a tame Breed of
Goats, that I needed not hunt any more about the
Woods, or fhoot at them; and if I did catch any
of them, after this it was by Traps, and Snares, as
I had done before; fo that for two Years after this,
I believe I never fir'd my Gun once off, though I
never went out without it; and which was more,
as I had fav'd three Piffols out of the Ship, I al-
ways carried them out with me, or at leaft two of
them, (ticking them in my Goat-Skin Belt; alfo I
furbifli'd up one of the great Cutlafhes, that I had
out of the Ship, and made me a Belt to put it on
alfo; fo that I was now a moft formidable Fellow
to look at, when I went abroad, if you add to
the former Defcription of myfelf, the Particular of
two Piftols, and a great broad Sword hanging at
my Side in a Belt, but without a Scabbard. <;
Things going on thus, as J have faid, for fomc
Time; I feem'd, excepting thefe Cautions, to be
reduc'd to my former calm, fedate way of Living,
all thefe Things tended to {hewing me more and
more how for my Condition was from being miJe-
table, compared to fome others; nay, to many
Other Particulars of Life, which it might have plea-
fed God to have made my Lot- It put me uppn;
reflecting, how little repining there would be .#?'
ipong Mankind, at any Condition of Life, if Peo-
ple would rather compare their Condition with"
thofe that are worfe, in order to be thankful, than
be always comparing them with thofe which arc'
better, to affift their Murmurings and Complain-
ings.
* As in my prefent Condition there were not really
many Things which I wanted; fo indeed I thought
that the Frights I had been in about thefe Savage
Wretches, and the Concern I had been in for my
dwn Prefervation, had taken off the Edge of my ti-
yentionfor my own Conveniences; and I haddropp'
•i good Defign, which I had once bent my Thoughts
too much upon;' and that was, to try if I could not
make fome of my Barley into Malt, and then try to.
t^rew myfelf fome Beer : This was really a whim-'
fical Thought, and I reprov'd myfelf often for the
Simplicity pf it; for I prefently' few there would/
be the Want of feveral Things '• neceffary to the
making my Beer, that it would be impoffible for
iye to fnpply : As firft, Casks to preferve it in,
which was a Thing, that as I have obferv'dalfea*'
fdy, I could never cpmpafs; no, though I fpent not
many Days, but Weeks, tray Months, in attempt-; f
jngjt, but to no purpofe. In the next place, I haty j
noHpps to make it keep, no Yeaft to make jt work,;
no Copper or Kettle to make it boil; and yet all
tjiefe Things, nptwithftanding, I verily ' believe,'
had not thefe Tilings interven'd, J mean tlie Fright^,
and Terrprs I was in about the'"$avages, thactun^
dertaken it,. and perhaps brought it to pafstop.

But my Invention now run quite another Way;
for Night and Day I could think of nothing but
how I might deftroy fome of thefe Monftersin their
cruel bloody Entertainment, and, if poffible, fave
the Victim they mouldering hither to deftroy. It
would take up a larger Volume than this whole
Work is intended to be, to fet down all the Con-
trivances I hatch'd, or rather brooded upon in my
Thought, for the deftroying thefe Creatures, or at
Jeaft frighting them, fo as to prevent their coming
hither any more ; but all was abortive, nothing
could be poffible to take effect, nnlefs I was to be
there to do it my felf; and what could one Man
dp among them, when perhaps there might be
twenty or thirty of them together, with their
Darts, or their Bows and Arrows, with which
they could fhoot as true to a Mark, as I could with
my GUJI?
Sometimes I contrived to dig a Hole under the
Place where they made their Fire, and put in Five
or Six Pound of Gun-powder, which, when they
kindled their Fire, would confequently take Fire,
and blow up all that was near it; but as in the firft
Place I fhould be very loth to wafte Jo.much Powder
upon them, my Store being now within the Quan-
tity of one Barrel ., fo neither could I be fure of its
going oft" at any certain time, when it might fur-
prize them, and at beft, that it would clo little' more
than ;uft blow the Fire about their Ears and fright
them, but not fufficient to make them forfake the
Place ; fp J laid' it'afide, and t^ien propos'd, that
I would place my felf in Ambufh, in fome con-
venient Place, with my three Quns, all double
loaded; aud in fh'e ihicldle of "their .bloody Cere-
mony, let fly at them, when I fhould be fure to kill
or wound perhaps two or three at every Shoot; and
then falling in upon them' with my three. Piflols,
Q " .and
find my Sword, J made no doubt but that if there.
was twenty, I fhould kill them all. This Fancy
pleas'd my Thoughts for fome Weeks, and I was Ip
full of it, that I often dream'd of it; and fometimes
that I was juft going tp let fly at them in my Sleep.
j' I went fp far with it in my Imagination, that J
f mploy'd my felf feveral Days to find out proper
places to put my felf in Ambufcade, as I fald, tp
watch for them ; and I went frequently to the Place
it felf, which was now grown more familiar to
me ; and efpecially while my Mind was thus fill'd
with Thoughts of Revenge, and of a bloody put-
ting twenty or thirty of them to the Sword, as I
may call it; the Horror I had at the Place, and
at the Signals of the barbarous Wretches devouring
one another, abated my Malice.
Well, at length I found a Place in the Side of
the Hill, where I was fatisfy'd I might fecurely
wait, till I faw any of their Boats coming, anjl
might then, even before they would be ready to
come on Shore, convey my felt unfeen into Thickets
' of Trees, in ope of which there was a hollow
large enpugh tp conceal me entirely,' and where I
. might fit and obferve all their bloody Doings, and,
'take my full aim at their jleads, when they were
Co clofe together, as that it would be next to im-
jpoflible that I fhould mifs my Shoot, or that I could
fail wounding three or foiir pf them at the firft
Shopt.'
'-. In this Place then I refolv'd to fix my Defign,
and Accordingly I prepar'd two Muskets and my
prdmary Fpwling-Pieqe, The two Muskets 1
* . loaded with a ^race' pf Slugs each, and four or five
jfmalter gullets, about the Size of Piftol-Bulfets;
and'the Fowling-Piece I loaded with near a Hand-
- ful pf jSwau-Shot; of the largeftSize; I alfo Ioade4
' my PiMs'wM about four Bullefs each; and in this
re
Pofture, well provided with Ammunition for a fe-
,cond and third Charge, I prepar'd my felf for my
Expedition. . i. v ., . , ,• . ..
After I had thus laid the Scheme of my Defign,
and in my Imagination put it in Practice, I conti-
nually made my Tour every Morning up to the
Top ef the Hil), which was from my Caftle, as I
call'd it, about three Miles, or more, to fee if I
could obferve any Boats upon the Sea, coming near
rhe I/land, or ftanding over towards it; but I be-
gan to tire of this hard Duty, after I had for two
or three Months cpnftantly kept my Watch ; but
came always back without any Difcovery, there
having not in all that Time been the leaft Appear-
ance, not only on, or near the Shore, but not on
the whole pcean, fo far as my Eyes or Glafles
could reach every Way.
As long as I kept up my daily Tour to the Hill
to look out, fo long alfo I kept up the Vigour of
my Defign, and my Spirits feem'd to be all the
while in a fuitable Form for fo outragiousan Exe-
cution as the killing twenty or thirty naked Savages,
for an Offence which I had not at all entred into a
Pifcuffion of in my Thoughts, any farther than my
Paflions were at firft fir'd by the Horror I conceiv'd
at the unnatural Cuftom of that People of the Coun-
try, who, it feems, had been fuflfcr'd by Providence,
in his wife Difpofition of the World, to have no
other Guide than that of their own abominable and
vitiated Faffions; and confeqttently were left, and
perhaps had been fo for fome Ages, to act fuch
horrid Things, and receive fuch dreadful Cuf-
voms, as nothing but >Jature entirely abandon'd
of Heaven, and a&ed by fome Hellifh Degeneracy,
.. could have run then* into : But now when, as I
•„. i have faid, I began to be weary of the fruitless Ex-
' •fprfipn which.I had made fo long, a«4 fo tar, eve-
W
ry Morning in vain, fo my Opinion of the Adion
itfelf began to alter, and I began with cooler and
calmer Thoughts to confider what it was I was go-
ing to engage in. What Authority or Call I had,
to pretend to be Judge and Executioner upon thefe
Men as Criminals, whom Heaven had thought fit
for fo many Ages to fufler unpunifh'd, to go on,
and to be, as it were, the Executioners of his Judg-
ments one upon another. How far thefe People
were Offenders againfl me, and what Right I had
to engage in the Quarrel of that Blood, which they
fiied promifcuoudy one upon another. I debated
this very often with my felf thus; How do I know
what God himfelf judges in this particular Cafe? it
is certain thefe People either do not commit this as
a Crime; it. is not againft their own Confciences
reproving, or their Light reproaching them. They
do not know it to be an Oftence, and then commit
it in Defiance of Divine, Jufticc, as wedoinalmoll
all the Sins we .commit. They think it no more a
•Crime to kill a Captive taken in War, than we do
to kill40, Ox; nor to eat humane Flefh, than we
do to cat Mutton.
. When I had confider'd this a little, it follow'd
neceflarily, that I was certainly in the Wrong in
it; that thefe People were not Murderers in the
Senfe that I had before condemned them in my
• Thoughts, any more than thofe Chriftians were
Murderers, who often put to Death the Prifoners
taken in Battel; or more frequently, upon manv
Occafions, put whole Troops of Men to the Sword,
without giving Quarter, though they threw down
their Arms and fubmitted.
In the next place itoccur'd to me,, that albeit the
. Ufuage they thus gave one another, was thus brutifh
?Lnd inhumane, yet it was really nothing to me!
.""Thefe Pepple had. d.on.eme no Injury : TJut if they
v. » attempted
_ ^
Attempted me", orl'fa-Vit nfeceflary for my imme-
diate Prefervation to Fall upon them, fomething
might be {"aid for it; but'that as I was yet out of
their Power,' and they had really no Knowledge
of me, and corifequently no Defign upon me;
therefore it could not be juft for me to fall upon
them. That this wou'd juftify the Conduct of the
Spaniards in all their Barbarities practis'd in Ame-
rica, and where' they deftroyed Millions of thefe
People, who, however they were Idolaters and Bar-
barians, and had feveral bloody and barbarous
Rites in their Cuftoms, fuch as facrificing humane
Bodies to their Idols, were yet, as to the Spaniards,
very innocent People ; and that the rooting them
out of the Country, is fpoken of with the utmoft
Abhorrence and Deteftation, by even the Sfaniardi
themfelves; at this time, and by all other Chrifli-
ah Nations of Europe, as a nicer Butchery, a bloo-
dy and unnatural Piece of Cruelty, tinjuftifiable ei->
ther to God or Man; and fuch, as for which the ve-
ry Name of a Spaniard is reckon'd to be' frightful
and terrible to allPeople of Humanity, or of Chrif-
tian Compaffion : As if the Kingdom of Spain were
particularly eminent for the Product of a Race o£
Men, who were without Principles of Tendernefs,
pr the commoti Bowels of Pity to the Miferable,
w.hich'is fedbfi'd to be a Mark of generous Tem-
per in the' Mind.
• Thefe Gonfi'derations realljr put me to a Paufe,
arid to a,feihd of a Full-flop ,* and I began by little
aird.Hf'rie.to be off of my Defign, and to conclude,
I had taken wrong Meafures in my Refolutions to
attack the.Savages; that it was not my Buiinefs to
ifte'ddle'w|thriHem, unlefs they firft attack'd me,
^hirf this'ic^raisiriyBufiriefs if poffible to prevent,'
but that if.1 were difcover'd; and ^ttack'd, then I
-."" 'rv ••'''' •" '•* :
 On the other hand, I argu'd with myfelf, That
this really was the way not to deliver myfelf, but
entirely to ruin and deftroy myfelf j for unlefs I was
fure to kill every one that not only fhould be oa
Shore at that time, but that fhould ever come on
Shore afterwards, if but one of them efcap'd, to
tell their Country People what had happen'd, they
would come over again by Thoufands to re*
venge the Death. of their Fellows, and I fhould
only bring upon myfelf a certain Deftru&ion,
which at prefent I had no manner of occ/ion
for.
Upon the whole I concluded, That neither in
Principles, nor in Policy, I ought one way or other to
concern myfelf in this Affair. That my Bufinefs
was by all poffible Means to conceal myfelf from
them, and not to leave the leaft Signal to them to
guefs by, that there were any living Creatures up-
on the Ifland; I mean of humane Shape,
Religion joyn'd in with this Prudential, and I was
convinc'd now many Ways, that I was perfeftly out
of my Duty, when I was laying all my bloody
Scfiemes for the Deftruction ofinnocent Creatures,
I mean innocent as to me : As to the Crimes they
were guilty of towards one another, I had nothing
to do with them; they were National, and I ought
to leave them to the Juftice of God, who is the
Governour of Nations, ana knows how by Na-
tional Puniflnnents to make a juft Retribution for
National Offences ; and to bring publick Judg*
men ts upon thofe who offend in a publick Manner,
by fuch Ways as beft pleafes him.
This appear'd fo clear to me now, that nothing
was a greater Satisfaction to me, than that I had.
not been fuffer'd to do a.Thing which I now few
fo much Reafdn. to believe would have been no lefs
j*. Sin, than that of wilful Murder, jf| had flim*
Kitted
 [ ^05
mitted it; and I gave moft humble Thanks on my
Knees to God, that had thus delivered me from
Blood-guiltinefs, befeeching him to grant me the
Protection of his Providence, that I might not fall
into the Hands of the Barbarians; or that I might
not lay my Hands upon them, unlefs I had a more
clear Call from Heaven to do it, in Defence of my
own Life.
In this Di/pofition I continued for near a Year
after this ; and fo far was I from defiring an Oc-
cafion for falling upon thefe Wretches, that in all
that Time I never once went up the Hill to fee
.whether there were any of them in fight, or to
know whether any of them had been on Shore
there, or not, that I might not be tempted to re-
new any of my Contrivances againft them, or be
provoked by any Advantage which might prefent it
felf, to fall upon them; only this I did, I went and
removed my Boat which I had on the other Side
the IQand, and carried it down to the Eaft-End of
the whole Ifland, where I ran it into a little Cove
.which I found under fome high Rocks, and where
I knew, by reafon of the Currents, the Savages durft
not, at leaft would not come with their Boats,
upon any Account whatibever.
With my Boat I carried away every Thing that
I had left there belonging to her, though not ne-
ceflary for the bare going thither, w*. a Maft and
Sail which I had made for her, and a Thing like
an Anchor, but indeed which could not be call'd
either Anchor or Grapling; however, it was the
bell I could make of its kind. All thefe I remo-
ved, that there might not be the leaft Shadow of
any Difcovery, or any Appearance of any Boat,
or of any Humane Habitation upon the Ifland.
Befides this, I kept my felf, as I faid, more re-
tired dun, ever, and feldom went from my Cell, o-
thec
thct than upon ray conftant Employment,
milk my She-Goats, and manage, my little Flock in
the Wood; which as itwas quiteon the.other Part
of the Ifland, was quite out of Danger ; for .certain
it is, that thefe Savage People, who fometimeg
haunted this Ifland, never came with any Thoughts
of finding any thing here; and confequently.; never
wandred off from the Coaft ; and I doubt not, bitf
they might.have been federal times.'on, more, after
my Apprehenfions of them had made me cautious a£
well. as before; and ,indeedr 1 look'd back with
fome Horror upon the -Thoughts of what my CQPT
dition .would have been, if I had ehop'd upon them-,
and been difcover'd before that, .when .naked and
.unarm'd, except with one Gun, and.that loaitefl
often only.: with final! Shot. I walk'd everywhere

might hawc done; much lefs, what:npw afiedo

Things, I fhould be very melancholy,: and foroe-
times it would laft a great while; but I refolv'd it
at laft all into Thankfialnjefs to that Providence,
which had deliver'd me from fo many uofeen Dan-
fers, and had kept raeftomthofe Mifchiefs whiah
•;;-u . .'•. I could
I could no way have been the Agent in delivering
my felf from ; becaufe I had not the leaft notion of
any fuch thing depending, or the leaft Suppofition
of it being poffible.
This renew'd a Contemplation, which oftenjiad
come td my Thoughts in former Time, whenfirft
I began to fee the merciful Difpofitions of Heaven,'
in the Dangers we run through in this Life. How
wonderfully we are deliver'd, when we know no-
thing of it. How, when we are in (a Quandary, as
we call it) a Doubt or Hefitation, whether to go
this Way, or that Way, a fecret Hint mall direct
us this Way, when we intended to go that Way;
nay, when Senfe, our own Inclination, and perhaps
Bufinefs has call'd to go the other Way, yet arrange
Impreffron upon the Mind, from we know not what
Springs,' and by we knOto not what Power, '{hall o-
ver-rule us to go this Way; and itihaUafterwards
.appear, tharhad'we gone that Way which wefhould
have gone, and even to bur Imagination ought to
have gone, we mould have. been ruin'd and loft.
Upon thefe, and many like Reflections, I after-
wards made it a certain Rule with me, That when-
ever I found thofe fecret Hints, or Preffings of my
Mind, to doing, or not doing any Thing that pre-
fented; or to going this Way, or that Way, I nevet
fail'd to obey the fecret Di&ate j though I knew no
other Reafon for it, than that fuch a Preflfure, or
fuch a Hint hung upon my Mind: I could give ma-
ny Examples of the Succefs of this Conduct in the
Courfe of my Life; but more efpecially in the lat-
ter Part of my inhabiting this unhappy Ifland ; be-
fides many .Otcafions which it is very likely I might
have taken notice of, if I had feen with the feme
Eyes then, that I law with.now: But'tis never too
late to be wife ; and I cannot but advife all confi-
de ling Men, whofe Lives arc attended with fuch ex-
'•:." .. traordinary
[ 208 }
traordinary Incidents as m'ine, or even though not
fo extraordinary, not to flight fuch fccret Intima-
tions of Providence, let them come from what invifi-
ble Intelligence they will, that I {hall not.difcufs,
and perhaps cannot account for; but certainly they
are a Proof of the Converfe of Spirits, and the fe-
cret Communication between thofe embody'd, and
thofe unembody'd ; and fuch a Proof as can never
be withftood : Of which 1 fhall have Occafion to
give fome very remarkable Inftances, in the Re-
mainder of my folitary Refidence in this difinal
Place.
I believe the Reader of this will not think
ftrange, if I contefs that thefe Anxieties, thefe con-
ftant Dangers I liv'd in, and the Concern that was
now upon me, put an End to all Invention, and to
all the Contrivances that I had laid for my future
Accommodations and Conveniences. I had the
Care of my Safety more now upon my Hands, than
that of my Food. I car'd not to drive a Nail, or
chop a Stick of Wood now, for fear the Noife I
fljould make, mould be heard; much lefs would I
fire a Gun, for the fame Reafon; and above all, I
was intolerably uneafy at making any Fire, left
the Smoke, which is vifible at a great Diftance in the
Day, fhould betray me ; and for this Reafon I re-
mov'd that Part of my Bufincfs which requirM Firtfi
fuch as burning of Pots and Pipes, &c. into my
new Apartment in the Woods, where, after I had
been fome time, I found, to my unfpeakable Confo-
lation, a mtcr natural Cave in the Earth, which
went in a vaft Way, and where, I dare fay, no Sa-
vage had been at the Mouth of it, or would be fo
hardy as to venture in, nor indeed v. ould any Man
:elfe, but one who, like me, wanted nothing fomuch
as 4 fate Retreat.
The Mouth of this Hollow was drthe Bottom
of a great Rock, where by meet Accident (I would
fay, if I did not fee abundant Reafon to afcribe
all fuch Things now to Providence) I was cutting
down fome thick Branches of Trees to make
Charcoal ; and before I go on, I muft obferve the
Reafon" of my making this Charcoal, which was
thus »•;•'
I was afraid of making a Smoke about my Ha-
bitation, as I faid before ; and yet I could not live
there without baking my Bread, cooking my Meat,
&(?. fo I cotttriv'd to burn fome Wood here, as I
had feen done in'England, under Turf, till it be-
tame Chark, or dry Coal; and then putting the
Fire out, I prefeiVd the Coal to carry Home, and
perform the ocher Services, which Fire was want-
ing for at Home, without Danger of Smoke. ~*~
'- .rBut this by the byk While I' was cutting down
folne Wood herei,' 1 perceiv'd that behind a very
thick. Branch of low Brufhwood, or Underwood,
ttyere was a kind of hollow Place. I was curious
to Took into it; and getting with Difficulty into
the 'Mouth of it, I found it was pretty large, that
is to fay, fufficient for me to {land uptight in it;
and perhaps another with me; but I muft confefs
tot you I made more hafte out than I did in, when
looking farther into" the Place, and which was
perfectly dark, J. faw two broad mining Eyes of
fome Creature, whether Devil or Man, I knew
not,. which twinkled like two Stars, the dim Light
from the Cave's Mouth fhining diredtly in, and
making the Reflection.
However, after fome Paufe, I recover'd my/felf,
arid began to call my felf a thoufand Fools, and
relJ my felf, that he that was" afraid.to fee the De-
vil, was not fit to live twenty Years in an liland all .
alone* and that I durft to believe there was ho-'
»'•:' P. thing
thing in this Cave that was more frightful than my
felt"; upon this, plucking up my Courage, I took
up a great Firebrand, and in I rulh'd again, with
the Stick flaming in my Hand ; I had not gone
three Steps in, but I was almoft as much frighted
as I was before; for I heard a very loud Sigh, like
that of a Man in fome Pain, and it was follow'd
by a broken Noife, as if of Words half exprefs'd,
and then a Deep Sigh again : I ftep'd back, and
was, indeed, flruck with fuch a Surprize, that it put
me into a cold Sweat; and if I had had a Hat on
my Head, I will not anfwer for it, that my Hair
might not have lifted it off. But ftill plucking up
my Spirits as well as I could, and encouraging my
felt a little, with confidering that the Power and
Prefence of God was every where, and was able
to protect me : Upcnthis I ilep'd forward again,
and by the Light of the Firebrand, holding it up
a little over my Head, I faw lying on the Ground
a moft monilrous frightful old He-goat, juft making
his Will, as we fay, and gafping for Life, and dy-
ing indeed of meer old Age.
. I fHr'd him a little, to fee if I could get him out,
and he efl'ay'd to get up, but was not able to raife
himfelf , and I thought with my felf, he might
even lie there; for if he had frighted me fo, he
would certainly fright any of the Savages, if any
of them fhould be fo hardy as to come in there,
while he had any Life in him.
I was now recover'd from my Surprize, and be-
gan to look round me, when I found the Cave was
but very fmall, that, is to fay, it might be about
twelve Foot over, but in no manner of Shape, ei-
ther round or fquare, no Hands having :ever been
employ'd in making it, but thofe of meer Nature.
I obferv'-d alfo, that there was a Place at the far-
ther Side of it, that went in farther, but was to
Jow,
. .. , .. ..
low, that it requir'd me to creep upon my
and Knees to go inpo it, and whither I went I
knew not; fo having no Candle, I gave it over
for fome Time; but relblv'd to come again the
next Day provided with Candles, and, a Tinder-
box, which I had made of the Lock of one of the
Muskets, with fome Wild-fire in the Pan. . . . _
Accordingly, the next Day I came provided
with fix large Candles of my own making; for I
inade very good Candles now of Goats Tallow;
and going into this low Place, I was oblig'd to
creep upon all Fours, as I have faid, almoft tea
Yards,' which, by the way, I thought was a Ven^
ture bold enough, confidering that I knew not
how far it might go, nor what was beyond it*
When I was got through the Strait, I found the
Roof rofe higher up, I believe near twenty Foot;
but never was fuch a glorious Sight feen in the
Jfland, I dare fay, as it was, to look round the
Sides and Roof of this Vault or Cave ; the Walls
reflected a hundred thoufand Lights to me from,'
my two Candles; what it'was in the Roek, whether
Diamonds, or any other precious Stones, or Gold,
Which I rather fuppos'd it to be, I knew not.
The Place I was in, was a moft delightful Ca-
vity, or Grotto, of its Kind, as could be expected,
though perfectly dark; the Floor was dry and
level, and had a fort of fmall loofe Gravel upon
it, fo that there was no naufeous or venomous
Creature to be feen, neither was there any Damp
or wet, on the Sides or Roof: The only Difficulty
in it,was the Entrance,, which, however, as it
was a Place of. Security, and fuch a Retreat.as I
wanted, I thought that was a Convenience; fo
that; I. was really rejoyc'd at the Difcovery, and re-
folv'd, without any Delay, to bring fome of thofe
Things which I was moft anxious about to this
P » Place;
Place; particularly, I refolv'd to bring hither my
Magazine of Powder, and all my fpare Arms, -viz,.
Two Fowling-Pieces, (for I had three in all) and
three Muskets,i(for of them I had eight in all;) fa
I kept at my Caftle only five, whiclrflood ready
mounted, like Pieces of Cannon, on my outmoft
Fence ; and were ready alfo to take out upon any
Expedition.
.tlf-.on this Occafion of removing my Ammuni-
tio'',1 took Occafion to open the Barrel of Powder
T&vhich I took up out of the Sea, and which had
been wet; and 1 tound that the Water had pene-
trated about three or four Inches into the Powder
on every Side, whkh caking and growing hard,
had preferv'd the Infide like a Kernel in a Shell;
jfo that I had near fi.xty Pound of very good Pow-
der in the Centre of the Cask, and this was art
agreeable Difcovery to me at that Time; fo I car-
ry 'd all away thither, never keeping above two.
or three Pound of Powder with me in my Caftle,
for fear of a Surprize of any Kind : I alfo carry'd
thither all the Lead I had 1'efc for Bullets.
I fancy'd myfelf now like one of the ancient
Giants, which were faid to tive in Caves and Holes
in the Rocks, where none could come at them»
for I perfwaded myfelf, while I was here, if five'
hundred Savages were to hunt me, they could ne-
ver find me out ; or if they did, they would not
venture to attack me here.
The old Goat, who I found expiring, dy'd in'
the Mouth of the Cave, the next Day after I made
this Difcovery; and I found it much eafier to dig
a great Hole there, and throw him in, and cover
him with Earth, than to drag him out: So I in-
ter'd him theres to prevent Oflencc to my Nofe.
Jww
f was now in my twenty third Year of Refi-
<jlence in this Ifland, and was fo naturaliz'd to the
Place, and to the Manner of Living, that could
I have butaenjoy'd the Certainty, that no Savages
would come to the Place to difturb me, J could
have been content to have capitulated for fpen.ding
the reft of my Time there, even to the laft Mo-
ftient, till I had laid me down and dy'd, like the old
Goat in the Cave. I had alfo arriv'd to fome little
I)iverfions and Amufements, which made the Time
pafs more pleafantly with me a great deal, than
it did before; as firft, I had taught my Putt, as I
noted before, to fpeak; and he did it fo familiarly,
and talkM fo articulately and plain, that it was
V£ry pleafant to me; and he lived with me no lefs
than fix and twenty Years. How long he might.
live afterwards, I know npt j tho' I know they
have a Notion in the Brafils, that they liw a. hun-
dred Years; perhaps poor PoU may be alive there
ftilJ, calling after Pos>r Robin Crufoe to this Day. I
wifh no Englijhman the ill Luck to come there and
Hear him j but if he did, he would certainly believe
it was the Devil. My Dog was a very pleafant
and loving Companion to me for no lefs than fix-
teen Years of my Time, and then d/d of meec
pld Age; as for my Cats, they multiply'd, as I have
obferv'd, to that Degree, that I was oblig'd to {hoot
feveral of them at firft, to keep them from devour-
ing me and all I had; but at length, when the
two old ones, I brought with me, were gone, and
after fome Time continually driving them from me,
and letting them have no Provifion with me, they
all ran wild into the Woods, except two or three
Favourites, which I kept tame; and whofe Young,
when they had any, I always drown?d; and thefe
were Part of my Family. Befides thefe I always '
two or three hpufhold Kids about me, which I
P taugh?
taught to feed out of my Hand ; and I had twg
niore Parrots which talk'd pretty well] and would
all call Robin Crufoe, but none like my firft; nor,
indeed, did I take the Pains with any of them that:
I had done with him. I had alfo feveral tame Sea-
Fowls, whofe Names J know not, who' I caught
upon the Shore, and cut their Wings j and the lit- I
tie Stakes which I had planted before my Cafile.^ tl
Wall being now grown up to a^lgbod thick Grove, 3=
thefe Fowls all liv.d among thtefc low Trees, and V
(bred there, which was very agreeable to me; fo tlj
that, as I faid above, J began to be very well con-
tented with the Life I led, if it might but have
been fecur'd from the Dread of the Savages.
But it was ptherwife directed; and it may not be
amifs for all People who {hall meet with my Story',
to make5 this juft Obfervation from it,' t//z,.'HoW
frequently, in the Courfe of our Lives, the Evil
which in itfelf we feek moil to fhun, and which,
when we are fallen into, is the moft dreadful td v?
us, is oftentimes' the very Means or Door of our it
Deliverance, by which alone we can be rais'd again 1;
from the Affliction we are fallen into. I could give , {
niany Examples of this in the Courfe of my unac- \
countable Life ; but in nothing was it more parti-
cularly' remarkable, than in the Circumftances of N
my laft Years of folitary |lefidence in this Ifland.
• It was now the Month of December, as I Hiicl above,
in my twenty third Year:; and this being the
Southern Solfiice, for Winter I cannot call it, was
the particular Time of my Harveft, and requir'a
my being pretty much abroad in the Fields ; wheii
going out pretty early in the Morning, even before
it was thorow Day-light, I was furpriz'd with fee-
ing a Light of fome Fire upon the Shore, at aDif-
ranee from me, of about two Miles towards the
Etnd of the Ifland, where I had bbferv'd foine Sa-
vages had been, as before, but not on the other
Side; but, to my great Affliction, it was on my
Side of the Ifland.
I was indeed terribly furpriz'd at the Sight, and
ftep'd ftiort within my Grove, not daring to go
out, left I might be furpriz'd ; and yet I had no
more Peace within, from the Apprehenfions I had,
that if thefe Savages, in rambling over the Ifland,
Ihould find my Corn {landing, or cut, or any of my
Works and Improvements, they would immediate-
ly conclude, that there were People in the Place,
and would then never give over till they had found
jne our. In this Extremity J went back directly to
pay Caftle, pnll'd up the Ladder after me, and made
all things without look as wild and natural as I
qould.
Then I prepar'd myfelf within, putting myfelf
jn a Pofture of Defence ,• I loaded all my Cannon,
as I call'd them; that is to fay, my Muskets, which
were mounted upon.my new Fortification, and all
my Piftols, and refolv'd to defend' myfelf to the
laft Gafp, not forgetting ferioufly to commend my
felf to the Divine Protection, and earneftly to pray
to God to deliver me out of the Hands of the Bar-
barians; and in this Pofture I continu'd about two
Hours, but began to be mighty impatient for In-
telligence abroad, for I had no Spies to fend out.
After fitting a while longer, and mufing what I
fhoulddo in this Cafe, I was not able to bear fit-
ting in Ignorance any longer j fo fetting up my
Ladder to the Side of the Hill, where there was a
flat Place, as I obferv'd before, and then pulling
the Ladder up after me, I fet it up again, and
mounted to the Top of the Hil), and pulling out
my Profpective-Glafs, which I had taken on pur-
ppfe, 1 laid me down flat qn my Belly on the
d^ and began to look for the Place. I prc-
P^. (ently
:ntly found there was no lefs than pine naked co
javages fitting round a fmaU Fire they had niadej 1
iot to warm them, for they had no need of'that, '(fa
he Weather being extreme hot; but, as I fuppos'd, At
:o drefs fome ot their barbarous Diet of humane C&
Flefh, which they had brought with them, whe-
:her alive or dead, I could not know. m;
They had two Canoes with them, which they
liad haled up upon the Shore ; and as it was then
Tide of Ebb, they feem'd to me to wait for the
Return of the Flood to go away again; it is not be
eafy to imagine what Coniuiion this Sight put me Bo
into, efpecially feeing them come on my Side the eai
Ifland, and fo near me too; but whenlobferv'd rit
their coming muft be always with the Current or at
the Ebb, I began afterwards to be more fedate ia
my Mind, being fatisfy'd that I might go abroad
with Safety all the Time of the Tide of Flood, if
they were not on Shore before: And having made
this Obfervation, I went abroad about my Hai- qu
yeft-work with the more Compofure. ffii
As I expected, fo it prov'd ; for as foon as the to
Tide made to the' Weftward, I faw them all take Si
Boat, and row (or paddle, as we call it) all away.
I fhould have obferv'd, 'that for an Hour and more
before they went off, they went to dancing, and I
could 'eaiily difcern their tottures and Geibrqs
by my Glaifes ; I could hot perceive by my nice'ft
Obfervation, but that they were Hark naked, and £
had not the leaft Covering upon them ; but whe- _jj
ther they were Men or Women, that I could not 'jj
diftinguifh.
As foqn as I faw them fhip'd and gone, I took
two Guns upon my Shoulders, and two Piftols at
jny Girdle, 'and my great Sword by my Side, with-
out a Scabbard, and with all the Speed I was able
to make, 1 went away to the Hill3 where I.had dif-
• ' ••' ' coverd
1
C *'7 3
cover'd the firft Appearance of all; and as fbon as
I gat thither, which was not lefs than two Hours,
(for I could not go apace, being fo leaden with
Arms as I was,) I perceived there had been three
Canoes more of Savages in that Place ; and look-
ing out farther, I faw they were all at Sea together,
making over for the. Main.
This was a dreadful Sight to me, efpecially
when going down to the Shore, I could fee the
Marks of Horror which the difmal Work they had
been about, had left behind it,w'sc. the fMocd, the
feones, and Part of the Flcfh of humane Bodies,
eaten and devour'd by thofe Wretches, with Mer-
riment and Sport: I was fo fill'd with Indignation
at the Sight? that I began now to premeditate the
."Deftru&ion qf the next that I faw there, let them
be who or how many foever.'
It feem'd evident to me, that the Vifits which
they thus make to this Ifland, are not very fre-
quent ; for it was above fifteen Months before any
more of them came on Shore there again ; that is
to fay, I neither faw them, or any Footfteps, or
Signals of them, in all that Time ; for as to the
rainy Seafons, then they are fure not to come a-
broad, at leaft pot fo far; yet all this while I liv'd
uncomfortably, by reafon of theconftant Apprehen-
llons I was in of their coming upon me by Surprize;
from whence I obferve, that the Expedition of*
Evil is more bitter than the Suffering, efpecially
if there is no Room to fhake off that Expectation,
or thofe Apprehenfions.
During all this Time, I was in the murdering
Humour, and took up moft of my Hours, which
{hould have been better employ'd, in contriving
how to circumvent and fall upon them, the very
next time I Ihould fee them ; efpecially if they
jQiould be divided, as they were the'laft Time, in-
r • ' V ' * 'V ' f ••'..' ' , ' ; • ' - r
to
to two Parties; nor did I confider at all, that if
I kill'd one Party, fuppofe Ten or a Dozen, I was
ftill the next Day, or Week, or Month, to kill
another, and fo another, even ad infinitum, till I
ihould be at length no lefs a Murderer than they
were in being Man-eaters, and perhaps much more
fo.
I fpent my Days now in great Perplexity and
Anxiety of Mind, expecting that 1 fhould one Day
or other fall into the Hands of thefe mercilefs Crea-
tures j and if I did at any time venture abroad, it
was not without looking round me with the great.'
eft Care and Caution imaginable; and now I found
to any great Comfort, how happy it was that I
provided for a tame Flock or Herd of Goats; for
I durft not, upon any Account, fire my Gun, efpe-
cially iiear that Side of the Ifland where they ufo
ally came, left I fhould alarm the Savages; and
if they had fled from me now^ I was fure to have
them come back again with, perhaps, two or three
hundred Cannes with them in a few Days, and then
t knew what to expect.
However, I wore out a Year and three Months
nore, before I ever faw any more of the Savages,
uid then I found them again, as I fhall foon ob-
erve. It is true, they might have been there once
jr twice, but either they made no Stay, or at leaft
[ did not hear them; but in the Month of May, as
lear as I could calculate, and in my four and twcn-
ieth Year, I had a very ftrange Encounter with
hem, of which in its place.
The Perturbation of my Mind, during thisfif-
een or fixteen Months Interval, was very great;
flept unquiet, dream'd always frightful Dreams,
r,d often karted out of my Sleep in the Night: In
je Day great Troubles overwhelm'd my Mind,
nd in the Night I dream'd often of killing the
* Savages,
C H9
Savages, and of the Reafons why I might j
the doing of it:.. But to wave all this for a while,
it was in the Middle of May, on the fixteenth Day
J think, as well as my poor wooden Calendar
.would reckon; for I marled all upon the Poft ftill;
I fay, it was the fixteenth of May, that it blew a
very great Storm of Wind, all Day, with a great
deal of Lightning and Thunder, and a very foul
Night it was after it: I know not what was the
particular Occafipn of it; but as I was reading in
the Bible, and taken up with very ferious Thoughts
about my prefent Condition, I was furpriz'd with a
Norfe of a Gun, as I thought, fir'd at Sea.
This was to be fure a Surprise of'a quite diffe-
rent Nature from any I had met with befpre; for
the Notions this put into my Thoughts were quite
of another Kind. I ftarted up in the greateft Hafte
imaginable, and in a trice clapt my Ladder to the
middle Place of the Rock, and pull'd it after me,
and mounting it the fecond Time, got to the Top
of the Hill thq yery Moment that a Flafh of Fire
bid me liften for a fecond Gun, which accordingly,
in about half a Minute, I heard, and by the Sound,
knew that it was from that Part of the Sea where
1 was driven down the Current in my Boat.
I immediately cpnfider'd that this muft be fome
Ship in Djftrefs, and that they had fome Comrade,
or Ibme other Ship in Company, and fir'd thefe Guns
tor Signals of Diltrefs, and to obtain Help : 1 had
this Prefence of Mind at that Minute, as to think
that though I could not help them, it may be
they might help me; fp I brought tpgether all the
dry Woocl I cpuld get at hand, and making a good
handfome Pile, I fet it on Fire upon the Hill; the
Wood was dry, and blaz'd freely; and though the.
Wind blew very hard, yet it burnt fairly out; that
was certain, if there was any fuch Thing as a
Ship,
 Ship, they muft needs fee it, and no doubt thejf
did ; for as foon as ever ray Fire blaz'd up, I heard
another Gun, and after that feveral others, all from
the fame Quarter. I ply'd my Fire all Night long,
till Day broke ; and when it was broad Day, and
the Air clear'd up, I faw fomething at a great Dif-
tance at Sea, full Eaft of the liland, whether a
Sail, or a Hull, I could not diftinguifh, no not
with my Glafles, the Diftance was fo great, and
the Weather ftill fomething hazy alfo; at leaft it
was fo out at Sea.
I look'd frequently at it all that Day, and foon
perceiv'd that it did not move,- fo I presently con-
cluded that it was a Ship at an Anchor; and being
eager, you may be fure, to be fatisfy'd, I took my
Gun in my Hand, and run toward the South Sideof
the Ifland, to the Rocks where I had formerly been
carry'd away with the Current, and getting up
there, the Weather by this Time being perfectly
clear, I could plainly fee, to my great Sorrow, the
Wreck of a Ship caft away in the Night, upon
thofe concealed Rocks which I found when I was
out in my Boat; and which Rocks, as they check'd
the Violence of the Stream, and made a kind of
Counter Stream, or Eddy, were the Occafion of my
recovering from the moft defperate hopelefs Con-
dition that ever I had been in in all my Life.
Thus, what is one Man's Safety, is another Man s
Deftruction; for it feems thefe Men, whoever they
were, being out gf their Knowledge, and the
Rocks being wholly under Water, had been driven
upon them in the Night, the Wind blowing hard at
£. and E. N. E. Had they feen the Ifland, as 1 muft
rieceflarily fuppofe they did not, they muft, as I
thought, have erideavoi«r'd.to have fav'd themfelves
on Shore by the Help of their Boat; but their firing
of Guns for Help, efpecially when they faw, as I
• imagin'd.
 till
imagm'd, my Fire, fill'd me with many Thoughts.
Firft I imagin'd, that .upon feeing my Light, they
might have put themfelves", into their Boat, and
have endeavour'd to make the Shore.; but that the
Sea going very high, they might have been caft
away; other times I imagin'd, that they might
liave loft jtheir Boat before, as might be the Cafe
many Ways; as • particularly, by the Breaking of
the Sea upon their Ship, which many times obli-
ges Men to {lave, or take in Pieces their Boat;
and fometimes to throw it 6Ver Board with their
own Hands: Other times I imagin'd, they had
fome other Ship or Ships in Company, who upon
the Signals of Diftrefs they had made, had taken
them up, and carry'd them off: Other whiles I fan-
cy'd, they were ^all gone off to Sea in their Boat,
and being hurry'd away by the Current that I
had been formerly in, were .carry'd out into the
great Ocean, where there was nothing but Mifery
and Perifhing; and that-perhaps they might by*
this Time think of Starving, and of being in a.
Condition to eat one another.
As all thefe were but Conjectures at beft^ fo in
the Condition I was in, I could do no more than
look on upon the Mifery of the poor Men, and
pity them, which had ftill this good Efted on
my Side, that it gave me more and more Caufe
to give Thanks to God, who had fo happily and
Comfortably provided for me in my defolate Con-
dition; and that of two Ships Companies who were
now caft away upon this Part of the World, not
one Life {hould be fpar'd but mine: I learn'd here
again to obferve, that it is very rare that the Pro-
vidence of God cafts us into any Condition of Life
fo low, or any Mifety fo great, but we may fee
fomething or other to be thankful for; and may fee
others in worfe Cireumftances than our ow^
. - •..,.' Such
. Such certainly was the Cafe of thefe Men, 6f to
whom I could not fo much as fee Room to fup- fo
pofe any of them were fav'd; nothing could make
it rational, fo much as to wifh or expeft that they
did not all perifh there, except the Poflibility only
of their being taken up by another Ship in Com- ful
pany; and this was but, meer Poflibility indeed; nc
for I faw not the leaft Signal or Appearance of any J tfc
fiich Thing. " fo
I cannor explain, by any poffible Energy 6f Words,- . «f tj,
what a ftrange Longiftg or Hankering of Defires I j ^
felt in my Soul upon this Sight; breaking out fome-
times thus; O that there had been but one or two;
nayj/or but one Soul fav'd out of this Ship, to have
efcap'd to me, that I might but have had one
Companion, one Fellow-Creature to have fpoken
to me, and to have convers'd with ! In all the Time
ot" my folitary Life, I never felt fo earneft, fo
lirong a Defire after the Society of my Fellow-
Creatures, or fo deep a Regret at the Want of it. .
There are fome fecret moving Springs in the Af-
fection's, which when they are let a going by fome
Object in View, or be it fome Object, though not
in View, yet render'd prefent to the Mind by the
Power of Imagination, that Motion carries out the
Soul by its Impetuofity to fuch violent eager Em-
bracings of the Object, that the Abfence of it is
infupportable. ,
Such were thefe earneft Wifhings, That but on&
Man had been fav'd 1 O that it had been but One'. I,
believe I repeated the Words, 0 that it had been l>ui
One, a thoufand Times; and the Defires were fo
tnov'd by it, that when I fpoke the Words, my
Hands would clinch together, and my Fingers prefs
:he Palms of my Hands, that if I had had any fofc
Thing in my Hand, it would have crufh'd itinvo-
.untarily; and my Teeth in my He&d.would ftrike
together,
together, and fet againft one another fo ftrong, that
for fome time I could not part them again.
. Let the Naturalifts explain thefe Things, and
the Reafon and Manner of them ; all I can fay to
them, is, to defcribe the Fact, which was even
furprizing to me when I found it; though I knew
not from what it fhould proceed, it was doubtlefs
the Effect of ardent Wifhes, and of ftrong Ideas
form'd in my Mind, realizing the Comfort which
the Converfation of one of my Fellow-Chriilians
would have been to me.
But it was not to be ; either their Fate or mine,
or both, forbad it; for till the laft Year of my be-
ing on this Ifland, I never knew whether, any
were fav'd out of that Ship or no ; and had only
the Affliction fome Days after, to fee the Corps of
a drown'd Boy come on Shore, at the End of the
Ifland, which was next the Shipwreck : He had on
no Cloaths but a Seaman's Waftcoat, a Pair of
open-knee'd Linnen Drawers, and a blue Linnea
Shirt; but nothing to direct me fo much as to
guefs what Nation he was of. He had nothing in
his Pocket but two Pieces of Eight and a Tobac-
co-pipe ; the laft was to me of ten times more Va-
lue than the firft.
It was now calm, and I had a great Mind to
venture out in my Boat to this Wreck, not doubt-
ing but I might find fomething on Board that
might be ufeful to me; but that did not altogether
prefs me fo much, as the Poffibility that there
might be yet fome living Creature on Board, whofe
Lite I might not only fave, but might, by faving
that Life, comfort my own to the laft Degree ;
and this Thought clung fo to my Heart, that I
could not be quiet Night nor Day, but I rnufh
venture out in my Boat on Board this Wreck; and
committing the reft to God's Providence, I thought
the
the Impreflton was fo ftrong upon my Mind, that
it could not be refilled, that it muft come from
fome invifible Direction, and thatlfhould be want-
ing to my felf, if I did not go. ••
Under 'the Power of this Impreffion I haften'd
back to my Caftle, prepar'd every Thing for my
Voyage, took a Quantity of Bread, a great Pot for
frefh Water, a Compafs to fleer by, a Bottle of
Rum, for I had' flill a great deal of that left; a Baf"
ket full of Raifins. .And thus loading my felf with
every thing neceflary, I went down to my Boat,
got the Water out of her, and- got her afloat, load-
ed all my Cargo in her, "and then went Home aj
gain for more ;• my fecond Cargo was a great Bag
full of Rice, the Umbrella to fee up over my Head
for Shade, another large Pot full of frefh Water;
and about two Dozen of iny fmaU Loaves, or
Barley-Cakes, more< than before, with a Bottle of
Goat's-Milk and a Cheefe : All which, with great
Labour and Sweat, I brought to my'Boat; and
praying to God to direct my Voyage, I put out,
and rowing or paddlifig the Canoe along the Shore,
I came at lail to. the utmoft Point of the Ifland
on that Side (viz,.) .N...E..And now I was to launch
out into the Ocean, and either to venture, or not
to venture. I lookU on 'the rapid Currents which
ran conftantly on both Sides of the Ifland, a"t a
Diftance, and which were very terrible tome,
from the Remembrance of the Hazard I bad been
in before, and my Heart began to fail rrte; for I
forefaw that if I was driven into either of thcfe
Currents, I mould be carr/d a vaft Way out to
Ssa, and perhaps out of my Reach, or Sight of the
Ifland again ; and that then, as my Boat was but
fmall, if • any little Gale of Wind fliould rife, I
[faould be inevitably loft.
Thefe
Thefe Thoughts fo opprefs'd my Mind, that I
•began to give over my Enterprise, and having ha-
led my Boat into a little Creek on the Shore, I
ftept out, and fate me down upon a little rifing
bit of Ground, very penfive and anxious, between
Fear and Defire about my Voyage; when as I was
mufing, I could perceive that the Tide was turn'd,
and the Flood came on; upon which my going
was for fo many Hours impracticable : Upon this,
prefently it occur'd to me, that I fhould go up to
the higheft Piece of Ground I could find, and ob-
ferve, if I could, how the Sets of the Tide, or Cur-
rents lay, when the Flood eame in, that I might
judge whether if I was driven oneway out, I might
not expect to be driven another Way Home,
with the fame Rapidnefs of the Currents: This
Thought was no fooner in my Head, but I cafl my
Eye upon a little Hill, which Efficiently over-
look'd the Sea both Ways, and from whence I had
a clear View of the Currents, or Sets of the Tide,
and which Way I was to guide myfelf in my Re-
turn ; here I found, that as the Current of the Ebb
fet out clofe by the South Point of the Ifland, fo
the Current of the Flood fet in clofe by the Shore
of the North Side, and that I had nothing to do but
to keep to the North of the Ifland in my Return,
and I fhould do well enough.
Encourag'd with this Obfervation, I refolv'd the
next Morning to fet out with the firftof the Tide;
and repofing myfelf for the Night in the Canoe, un-
der the great Watch-coat I mentioned, I launch'd
out: I madefirfta little out to Sea full North, till I
began to feel the Benefit of the Current, which fet
Eaftward, and which carry'd me at a great Rate,
•and yet did not fo hurry me as the Southern Side
Current had done before, 'and fo as to take from,
m,e all Government of the Boat j but having a
I':.,. Q. '.
is we had at the Brafils; and in.a Word, not at if
good; but when I came to open the Chetts, I
found feveral Things of great Ufe to me: For
Example, I found in one a fine Cafe of Bottles, of
an extraordinary Kind, and fill'd with Cordial Wa-
ters, fine, and very good; the Bottles held about
three Pints each, and were tijp'd with Silver: I
found two Pots of very good Succades, or Sweet-
meats, fo faften'd alfo oh Top, that the Salt Water
had not hurt them; and two more of the fame,
which the Water had fpoil'd : I found fome very
good Shirts, which were very welcome to me, and
about a Dozen and half of Linnen white Handker-
chiefs, and colour'd Neckloths; the former were
alfo very welcome, being exceeding refrefhing to
wipe my Face in a hot Day ; befides this, when I
came to the Till in the Chefts, I found there three
great Bags of Pieces of Eight, which held out about
eleven hundred Pieces in all; and in one of them,
wrapt up in a Paper, fix Doubloons of Gold, and
fome fmall Bars or Wedges of Gold ; I fuppofe they
might all weigh near a Pound.
The other Cheft I found had fome Cloaths in if,
but of little Value ; but .by the Circumftances it
mift have belong'd to the Gunner's Mate, though
:here was no Powder in it, but about two Pound ot
ine glaz'd Powder, in three fmall Flasks, kept, I
uppofe, for charging their Fowling Pieces on Oc-
:afion : Upon the Whole, I got very little by this
/oyage, that was of any Ufe to me; for as to the
kloney, I had no Manner of Occafion for it; 'twas
o me as the Dirt under my Feet; and I would
ave given it all for three or four Pair of EiftfiP
hoes and Stockings, which were Things I greatly
ranted, but had not had on my Feet now tor
uny YearS: I had, indeed, gotten two Pair or
lioes now; which I took off of the Feet or the
two
two drown'd Men, who I favv in the Wreck ; and
I found two Pair more in one of the Chefts, which
were very welcome to me; but they were not like
our English Shoes, either for Eafe or Service, being
rather what we call Pumps than Shoes: I found
in this Seaman's Cheft about fifty Pieces of Eight
in Royals, but no Gold ; I fuppofe this belong'd
to a poorer Man than the other, which feem'd to
belong to fome Officer.
• Well, however, I lug'd this Money home to
jriy Cave, and laid it up, as I had done that before,
which I brought from our own Ship j but it was
great Pity, as I faid, that the other Part of this
Ship had not come to my Share, for I an; fatisfy'd
I might have loaded my Canoe feveral Times over
with Money, which, if I had ever efcap'd to Eng-
land, would have lain here" fafe enough till I might
have come again and fetch'd it.
Having now brought all my Things on Shore,,
and fecur'd them, I went back to my Boat, and
row'd or paddled her along the Shore to her old
Harbour, where I laid her up, and made the beft
of my way to my old Habitation, where I found
every Thing fafe and quiet ; fo I began to repofe
my felf, live after my old Fafhion, and take
Care of my Family - Aftairs ; and for a while, I
lived eafy enough, only that I was more vigilant
than I ufed to be, look'd out ofcner, and did not
go abroad fo much; and if at any time I did ftir
with any Freedom, it was always to the Eaft
Part of the Jlland, where I was pretty well fatif-
fy'd the Savages never came, and where I could
go without fo many Precautions, and fuch a Load
of Arms and Ammunition, as I always carry'd with
me, if I went the other Way.
I liv'd in this Condition near two Years more ;
but my unlucky Head, that was always to let me
" know
now it was born to make my Body miferable. Hoi
vas all the two Years fill'd with Pro/efts and Do<
Defigns, how, if it were poffible, I might get away then
rom this Ifland ; for fometimes I was for making the
.nother Voyage to the Wreck, though my Rea- favit
on told me that there was nothing left there worth B
he Hazard of my Voyage: Sometimes for a fo I
Gamble one Way, fometimes another; and I be* the
ieve verily, if I had had the Boat that I went from Ext
SaHee in, I fliould have ventur'd to Sea, bound any and
vhere I knew not whither. I W
I have been, in all my Circumftances, a Memento Statj
:o thofe who are touch'd with the general Plague Mea
af Mankind, whence, for ought I know, one Half and
af their Miferies flow; I mean, that of not'being Rea
[atisfy'd with the Station wherein God and Na- tt n
cure hath plac'd them; for not to look back upon njy
my primitive Condition, and the excellent Advice Sch
pf my father, the Qppofition to which, was? *ou
as I may caS it, my ORIGINAL SIN, my fubfequent I
Miftakes of the fame Kind had been the Means of atei
my coming into this miferable Condition; for had laid
that Providence, which fo happily had feared me Con
at the Srafils, as 3 Planter, blefs'd me with con- mot
fin'd Defires, and I could have been contented to not
have gone on gradually, I might have been by this tlia
Time, / mec\n in the "Timt of my being in this tymh ^
pne of the mofl confiderable Planters in the Bra- I
fils; nay, I am perfwaded, that by the Improve- Ma
pients I had made in that little Time I liv'd there, Kit
^nd the Encreafe I fhould probably have made, it I l)'i
jhad ftay'd, I might have been worth an hundred
thoufand Moyadorps; and what Bufine/s had I £0
|eaye a fettled Fortune, a well-itock'd Plantation,
improving and encreafing, to turn Sufra Cargo to Wi
guinea, tp fetch Negroes, when Patience a"4 ' vw
" fo encreas'd pur Stock at
Home, that we could have bought them at our own
Door, from thofe whofe Bufinefs it was to fetch
them? and tho' it had coft us fomething more, yet
the Difference of that Price was by no means worth
faving at fo great a Hazard.
But as this is ordinarily the Fate of young Heads,
fo Reflection upon the Folly of it, is as ordinarily
the Exercife of more Years, or of the dear-bought
Experience of Time ; and fo it was with me now ;,
and yet fo deep had the Miftake taken root in
my Temper that I could not fatisfy myfelf in my
Station, but was continually poring upon the.
Means and Poffibility of my Efcape from this Place ;
and that I may with the greater Pleafure to the
Reader bring on the remaining Part of my Story,
it may not be improper to give fome Account of
my firft Conceptions on the Subject of this foolifh
Scheme for my Efcape ; and how, and upon what
Foundation I acted.
I am now to be fuppos'd retired into my Cattle,
after my late Voyage to the Wreck, my Frigate
laid up, and fecur'd under Water, as ufual, and my
Condition reftored to what it was before : I had
more Wealth indeed, than I had before, but was
not at all the richer ; for I had no more Ufe for it,
than the Indians of Peru had before the Spaniards
came there.
It was one of the Nights, in the rainy Seafon in
March, the four and twentieth Year of my firft
ietting Foot in this Ifland of Solitarinefs, I was
lying in my Bed, or Hammock, awake, very well
in Health, had no Pain, no Diflemper, no Unea-
finefs of Body, no, nor any Uneafinefs of Mind,
more than ordinary, but could by no Means
clofe my Eyes ; that is, fo as to fleep ; no, not 3
Night long, otherwife than as follows ;
••' '•• 0.4• • ••-••• »
It is as impoffible as necdlefs, to fet down the
innumerable Crowd of Thoughts that whirl'd
through that great Thorowfair of the Brain, the
Memory, in this Night's Time: I run over the
whole Hiftory of my Life in Miniature, or by
Abridgment, as I may call it, to my coming to this
Ifland; andalfo of the Part of my Life fince I
came to this Ifland. In my Reflections upon the
State of my Cafe, fince I came on Shore on this
Ifland, I was comparing the happy Pofture of my
Affairs in the firft Years of my Habitation here,
compar'd to the Life of Anxiety, Fear, and Care,
which I had liv'din ever fince I had feen the Print of
a Foot in the Sand; not that I did not believe the
Savages had frequented the I/landeven all the while,
and might have been feveral Hundreds of them it
times on Shore there; but I had never known it,
and was incapable of any Apprehenfions about it;
my Satisfaction was perfect, tho' my Danger was
the fame ; and I was as happy in not knowing my
Danger, as if I had never really been expos'd to it.
This furnifh'd my Thoughts with many very pro-
fitable Reflections, and particularly this one, How
infinitely good that Providence is, which has pro-
vided in its Government of Mankind fuch narrow
Bounds to his Sight and Knowledge of Things;
and tho' he walks in the Mid/t pf fo many thou-
fand Dangers, the Sight of which, if difcover'd to
him, would diftract his Mind, and fink his Spirits,
he is kept ferene and calm, by having the Events
of Things hid from his Eyes, and knowing no-
thing of the Dangers which furround him.
After thefe Thoughts had for fome Time enter-
tain'd me, I came to refled ferioufly upon the real
Danger I had been in for fo many Years in this
very Ifland-t and how I had walk'd about in the
greatefl Security, and with all poffible Tranquili-
ty ; even when perhaps nothing but a Brow of a
Hill, a great Tree, or the cafual Approach of •
Night, had been between me and the worft Kind
of Deftrudtion, viz,. That of falling into the Hands
of Canibals and Savages, who would have feis'd
on me with the fame View as I did of a Goat or
a Turtle, and have thought it no more a Crime to
kill and devour me, than I did of a Pidgeon or a
Curlieu : I fhould unjuflly flander myfelf, if I
fhould fay I was not fincerely thankful to my
great Preferver, to whofe fingular Protection I ac-
knowledg'd with great Humility, that all thefe
unknovrn Deliverances were due ; and without
which I muft inevitably have fallen into their mer-
jcilefs Hands.
When thefe Thoughts were over, my Head was
for fome time taken up in confidering the Nature
of thefe wretched Creatures, I mean the Savages ;
and how it came to pafs in the World, that the
wife Governour of all Things fhould give up any
of his Creatures to fuch Inhumanity; nay, to
fomething fo much below even Brutality itfelf, as
to devour its own Kind; but as this ended in fome
(at that time fruitlefs) Speculations, it occur'd
to me to encjuire, what Part of the World thefe
Wretches liv'd in ; how far oft' the Coaft was from
whence they came; what they ventur'd over fo far
from Home for; what Kind of Boats they had ;
and why I might not order myfelf, and my Buli-
nefs fo, that I might be as able to go over thither,
as they were to come to me.
I never fo much as troubled myfelf to confider
what I fhould do with myfelf when I came thi-
ther ; what would become of me, if I fell into the
Hands of the Savages; or how I mould efcape from
them, if they attempted me; no, nor fo much as
how it was poffible for me to reach the Coaft, and
not
not be attempted by fome or other of them, with-
out any Poflibility of delivering myfelf; and if I
fhould not tall into their Hands, what I fhould do
for Provifion, or whither I fhould bend my Courfe;
none of thefe Thoughts, I fay, fo much as came
in my Way ; but my Mind was wholly bent upon
the Notion of my pafling over in my Boat to the
main Land : I look'd back upon my prefent Con-
dition, as the moft miferable that could poflibly be,
that I was not able to throw myfelf into any thing
but Death, that could be call'd worfe; that if I
reach'd the Shore of the Main, I might perhaps
meet with Relief, or I might coaft along as I did
on the Shore of Africk, rill I came to fome in-
habited Country, and where I might find fome Re-
lief ; and after all, perhaps I might fall in with
fome Chriftian Ship that might take me in; and
if the worft came to the worft, I could but die,
which would put an end to all thefe Miseries at
once. Pray note, all this was the Fruit of a dif-
turb'd Mind, an impatient Temper, made as it
were defperate, by the long Continuance of my
Troubles, and the Difappointments I had met in
the Wreck I had been on Board of, and where I
had been fo near the obtaining what I fo earneftly
long'd for, viz.. fome Body to fpeak to, and to learn
fome Knowledge from of the Place where I was,
and of the probable Means of my Deliverance:
1 fay, I was agitated wholly by thefe Thoughts.
All my Calm of Mind in my Refignation to Pro-
vidence, and waiting the Iflbe of the Difpofitions
of Heaven, feem'd to be fufpended; and I had, as
it were, no Power to turn my Thoughts' to any
Thing, but to the Project of a Voyage to the
Main, which came upon me with fuch Force, and
fuch an Impetuofity of Defire, that it was not to
be refilled, .. " „
When
When this had agitated my Thoughts for two
Hours or more with fuch Violence, that it fee
my very Blood into a Ferment, and my Pulfe beat
as high as if I had been in a Fever, merely with
the extraordinary Fervour of my Mind about it,
Nature, as if I had been fatigued and exhaufted
with the very Thought of it, threw me into a
found Sleep: One would have thought I fhould
have dream'd of it ; but I did not, nor of any
Thing relating to it; but I dream'd, that as I wasr
going out in the Morning, as ufual, from my Caftle,
J faw upon the Shore two Canoes, and eleven Sava-
ges coming to Land, and that they brought with
them another Savage, who they were going to kill,
in order to eat him; when on a fudden, the Sa-
vage that they were going to kill, jump'daway
and ran for his Life ; and I thought in my Sleep,
that he came running into my little thick Grove
before my Fortification to hide himfelf; and that
I feeing him alone, and not perceiving that the o-
ther fought him that way, fhew'd myfelf to him,
and, fmilingupon him, encourag'd him; that he
kneel'd down to me, feeming to pray me to affift
him; upon which I fhew'd my Ladder, made him
go up, and carry'd him into my Cave, and he be-
came my Servant ; and that as foon as I had got-
ten this Man, I faid to myfelf, now I may cer-
tainly venture to the Main Land ; for this Fellow
will ferve me as a Pilot, and will tell me what to
do, and whither to go for Provifions; and whi-
ther not to go for fear of being devour'd, what Pla-
ces to venture into, and what to efcape : I wak'd
with this Thought, and was under fuch inexpref-
fible Impreffionsof Joy at the Profpect of my Efcape
in my Dream, that the Difappointments which I felt
upon coming to myfelf, and finding it was no
fmore than a Dream, were equally extravagant the
other Way, and threw me into a very great Dejec-
tion of Spirit.
Upon this, however, I made this Conclufion,
That my only Way to go about an Attempt for an
Efcape, was, if poflible, to get a Savage into my
Pofleffion; and, if poflible, it mould be one of their
Prifoners, who they had condemn'd to be eaten,
and mould bring thither to kill; but thefe
Thoughts {till were attended with this Difficulty,
that it was impoflible to effect this, without at-
tacking a whole Caravan of them, and killing them
all; and this was not only a very defperate At-
tempt, and might mifcarry ; but, on the other
hand, I had greatly fcrupled the Lawfulnefs of it to
me, and my Heart trembled at the Thoughts of
ihedding fo much Blood, tho' it was for my Deli-
verance. I need not repeat the Arguments which
occur'd to me againft this, they being the fame
mention'd before : But tho' I had other Reafons to
offer now, (viz,.) that thofe Men were Enemies to
my Life, and would devour me, if they could;
that it was Self-prefervation in the higheft Degree,
to deliver myfelf from this Death of a Life, and
was acting in my own Defence, as much as if they
were actually aflaulting me, and the like. I fay,
tho' thefe Things argued for it, yet the Thoughts
of fhedding humane Blood for my Deliverance,
were very terrible to me, and fuch as I could
by no Means reconcile my felf to a great
while.
However, at laft, after many fecret Difputes
with myfelf, and after great Perplexities about
it j for all thefe Arguments, one way and another,
ftruggled in my Head a long Time ; the eager
prevailing Defire of Deliverance at length mafter'd
all the reft; and I refolv'd, if poflible, to get one
of thofe Savages .into my Hands, coft what if
would,
would. My next Thing then was to contrive how
to do it, and this indeed was very difficult to re-
folve on: But as I could pitch upon no probable
Means for it, fo I refolv'd to put myfelf upon the
Watch, to fee them when they came on Shore,
and leave the reft to the Event, taking fuch Mea-
fures as the Opportunity fhould prefent, let be what
would be.
* With thefe Refolutions in my Thoughts, I fet
myfelf upon the Scout, as often as poffible, and
indeed fo often, till I was heartily tir'd of it; for
it was above a Year and half that I waited, and
for great part of that Time went out to the Weft
End, and to the South Weft Corner of the IQand,
almoft every Day, to fee for Canoes, but none
appear'd. This was very difcouraging, and began
to trouble me much; tho' I cannot fay that it did
in this Cafe, as it had done fome Time before that,
(viz,.) wear off the Edge of my Defire to the Thing.
But the longer it feem'd to be delay'd, the more
eager I was for it; in a Word, I was not at firft fo
careful to fbun the Sight of thefe Savages, and
avoid being feen by them, as I was now eager to
be upon them.
Befides, I fancy'd myfelf able to manage one,
nay, two or three Savages, if I had them, fo as to
make them entirely Slaves to me, to do what-
ever I fhould direct them, and to prevent their
being able at any Time to do me any Hurt. It
was a great while, that I pleas'd myfelf with this
Affair, but nothing ftiil prefented ; all my Fancies
and Schemes came to nothing, fot no Savages came
near me for a great while.
About a Year and half after I had entertain'd
thefe Notions, and, by long mufing, had as it were
refolv'd them all into nothing, for want of an Oc-
cafion to put them in Execution, I was furpriz'd
one
one Morning early, with feeing no lefs than
Canoes all on Shore together on my fide the Ifland;
and the People who belong'd to them all landed,
and out of my Sight: The Number of them broke
all my Meafures ; for feeing fo many, and know-
ing that they always came four or fix, or fometimes
more, in a Boat, I could not tell what to think of
it, or how to take my Meafures, to attack twen-
ty or thirty Men fingle handed; fo I lay ftill in
my Caftle, perplexed and difcomforted: However,
1 put myfelf into all the fame Poftures for an At-
tack, that I had formerly provided, and was juii
ready for Action, if any thing had prefented. Ha-
ving waited a good while, liftening to hear if they
made any Noife; at length, being very impatient,
I fet my Guns at the Foot of my Ladder, and
clamber'd up to the Top of the Hill, by my two
Stages as ufual; ftanding fo, however, that my
Head did not appear above the Hill, fo that
they could not perceive me by any means : Here
I obferv'd, by the Help of my Perfpective Gla&,
that they were no lefs than thirty in Number, that
they had a Fire kindled, that they had had Meat
drefs'd ; how they had cook'd it, that I knew not,
or what it was; but they were all dancing in I
know not how many barbarous Geflures and Fi-
gures their own Way, round the Fire.
While. I was thus looking on them, I perceiv'd,
by my Perfpedive, two miferable Wretches drag'd
from the Boats, where it feems they were laid by,
ind were now brought out for the Slaughter. I
perceiv'd one of them immediately fell, being
inock'd down, I fuppofe with a Club or Wooden
Jword, for that was their Way, and two or three
>thers were at Work immediately cutting him open
or their Cookery, while the other Victim was left
landing by himfelf, till they ftould be ready foe
.him,
him". In that very Moment this poor Wretch fee-
ing himfelf a little at Liberty, Nature infpir'd him
with Hopes of Life, and he ftarted away from
them, and ran with incredible Swiftnefs along the
Sands diredly towards me, I mean, towards that
part of the Coaft where my Habitation was.
I was dreadfully frighted, (that I muft acknow-
ledge) when I perceiv'd him to run my Way; and
efpecially, when as I thought I faw him purfued
by the whole Body; and now I expected that Part
of my Dream was coming to pafs, and that he
would certainly take Shelter in my Grove; but I
could. not depend by any Means upon my Dream
for the reft of it, (viz,.) that the other Savages
would not purfue him thither, and find him there.
However I kept my_ Station, and my Spirits began
to recover, when I found that there was not above
three Men that follow'd him; and ftill more was I
encourag'd, when I found that he outftript them
exceedingly in Running, and gain'd Ground of
them, fo that if he could but hold it for half an
Hour, J faw eafily he would fairly get away from
them all.
There was between them and my Caftle the
Creek which I mentioned often at the firft Part of
my Story, when I landed my Cargoes out of the
Ship ; and. this, I faw plainly, he muft neceflarily
fwim over, or the poor Wretch would be taken
there: But when the Savage efcaping came thi-
ther, he made nothing of it, tho* the Tide was
then up, but ph.nging in, fwam thro' in thir-
ty Strokes or thereabouts, landed, and ran on
with exceeding Strength and Swiftnefs ; when the
three Perfons came to the Creek, I found that two
of them could fwim, but the third could not,
and that ftanding on the other Side, he look'd at
the other, but went no farther; and fqon after went
r. . fofcly
140
foftly back again, which, as it happen'd, was v?
• ry well for him in the main.
I obferv'd, that the two who fwam, were yet
more than twice as long fwimming over the Creek,
as the Fellow was that fled from them : It came
now very warmly upon my Thoughts, and indeed
irrefiftibly, that now was my Time to get me 2
Servant, and perhaps a Companion or Afliftant;
and that I was call'd plainly by Providence to fave
this poor Creature's Life; I immediately run down
the Ladders with all poflible Expedition, fetch'd
my two Guns, for they were both but at the Foot
or" the Ladders, as I obferv'd above; and getting
.up again with the fame Hafte to the Top of the
Hill, I crofs'd toward the Sea; and having a very
fhort Cut, and all "down Hill, clap'd myfelf in
the way between the Purfuers and the Purfued;
hollowing aloud to him that fled, who looking
back, was at firft perhaps as much frighted at me
as at them; but 1 beckon'd with my Hand to him
to come back, and in the mean time I flowly ad-
vanc'd towards the two thatfollow'd; then rutting
at once upon the foremoft, I knock'd him down with
the Stock of my Piece: I was loth to fire, becauie
I would not have the reft hear; though at that
Piftance it would not have been eafily heard;
and being out of Sight of the Smoak too, they
would not have eafily known what to make of it:
Having knock'd :his Fellow down, the other, who
purfu'd him ftop'd, as if he had been frig^
.ed; and I advanc'd apace towards him; but as 1
came nearer, I perceiv'd prefcntly he had a Bow
and Arrow, and was fitting it to fhoot at me; io 1
was then neceflitated to fhoot at him firft, which 1
did, and fcill'd him at the firft Shoot; the poor Savage
who fled, but had ftop'd, though he fa\v both
his Enemies fallen, and kill'd, as he thought; yet
vvas
was fo frighted with the Fire, and Noife of my
Piece, that he ftood ftock-flill, and neither came
forward or 'went backward, tho' the feem'd rather
inclin'd to. fly ftill, than to "come on ; I hollow'd
" again to him, and made Signs to come forward,
which he eafily underftood, and came a little Way,
then ftopp'd again ; and then. a little farther, and
ftopp'd again; and I could then perceive that he
flood trembling, as if he had been taken Prifoner,
and had juft been to be kill'd, as his two Enemies
were: I beckon'd him again to come to me, and
gave him all the Signs of Encouragement that I
could think of, and he came nearer and nearer,
kneeling down every ten or twelve Steps, in Token
" of Acknowledgment for my faving his Life: I fmil'd
at him, and look'd pleafantly, and beckon'd to him
to come ftill hearer; at length he came clofe to me,
and then he krieel'd down again, kifs'd the Ground,
'and laid 'his Head upon the Ground, and takirig
me by the. Foot, fet my Foot upon his Head ;
this, it feems, was in Token of fwearing to be my
Slave for ever. I took him up, and made much of
him, arid encourag'd him all I could: But 'there
was more Work to do yet, for I perceiv'd the Sa-
vage, whom I knock'd down, was not kill'd, but
ftumVd with the Blow, and began to come tohim-
felf j fo I "pointed to him, and i ho wing him the Sa-
vage, that he was not dead; upon this he fpoke
fome Words to me, and tho' I 'could not underftand
them, yet I thought they were pleafant to hear, for
they were the firft Sound of a Man's Voice that I
had heard, my own excepted, for above twenty five
Years. But there was no Time for fuch Reflecti-
ons now; the Savage, who was knock'd down,
recover'd himfelf fo far, as to fit up upon the
Ground, and I perceiv'd that my Savage began to
be afraid ; but when I faw that I presented my o-
R ther
ther Piece at the Man, as if I would fhoot him;
upon this my Savage, for fo I call him now, made
a Motion to me to lend him my Sword, which hung
naked in a Belt by my Side; ib I did: He no foon.
er had it, but he runs to his Enemy, and at one
Blow cut off his Head as cleverly, no Executioner
in Germany could have done it fooner or better;
which I thought very ftrange, for one, who I had
Reafon to believe never law a Sword in his Life be-
fore, except their own wooden Swords; however,
it feems, as I learn'd afterwards, they make their
wooden* Swords fb fharp, fo heavy, and the Wood
is fo hard, that they will cut off Heads even with
them, aye and Arms, and that at one Blow too:
When he had done this, he comes laughing to me
in Sign of Triumph, and brought me the Sword
again, and with abundance of Geflures, whfchl
did not underftand, laid it down with the Head of
the Savage that he hadkill'd, juft before me.
But that which aftonifh'd him moft, was to
know how I had kill'd the other Indian fo far off;
fo, pointing to him, he made Signs to me to let
him go to him j fo I bad him go, as well as I could;
when he came to him, he flood like one amaz'd,
looking at him, turn'd him firft on one Side, then
on t'other, look'd at the Wound the Bullet had
made, which, it feems, was juft in his Breaft, where
it had made a Hole, and no great Quantity of
Blood had follow'd, but he had bled inwardly, for
he was quite dead : He took up his Bow and Ar-
rows, and came back, fo I turn'd to go away, and
beckon'd to him to follow me, making Signs to
him, that more might come after them.
Upon this he fign'd to me, that he fhould bury
them with Sand/tbat they might not befeenby
the reft if they follow'd; and fo I made Signs again
:o him to do fo; he fell to work, and in an Inftant
he
[.*43
he had fcrap'd a Hole in the Sand with his Hands,
big enough to bury the firft in, and then dragg'd
him into it, and cover'd him, and did fo alfo by
the other; I believe he had bury d them both in a
Quarter of an Hour; then calling him away, I car-
ry'd him not to my Caftle, but quite away to my
Cave, on the farther Part of the Ifland; fo I did
not let my Dream come to pafs in that Part, viz.
That he came into my Grove for Shelter.
Here I gave him Bread, and a Bunch of Raifins
to eat, and a Draught of Water, which I found he
was indeed in great Diftrefs for, by his Running ^
and having refrem'd him, I made Signs for him to
go lie down and fleep, pointing to a Place where
I had laid a great Parcel of Rice Straw, and a
Blanket upon it, which I ufed to fleep upon my
(elf fometimes; fb the poor Creature laid down,
and went to fleep.
He was a comely handfome Fellow, perfectly well
made, with ftrait ftrong Limbs, not too large, tall
and well fhap'd, and, as I reckon, about twenty fix
Years of Age. He had a very good Countenance,
not a fierce and furly Afpedt, but feem'd to have
fbmething very Manly in his Face, and yet he had
all the Sweetnefs and Softnefs of an European in his
Countenance too, efpecially when he fmird. His
Hair was long and black, not curl'd like Wool ^ his
Forehead very high, and large, and a great Vivacity
and fparkling Sharpnefs in his Eyes. The Colour of
his Skin was not quite black, but very tawny, and
yet not of an ugly yellow naufeous Tawny, as the
Brafilians, and Virgiuians^ and other Natives of A-
merica are, but of a bright Kind of a dun Olive Co-
lour, that had in it fomething very agreeable, tho*
not very eafy to defcribe. His Face was round
and plump, his Nofe fmall, not flat like the Ne-
groes, a very good Mouth, thin Lips, and his
R 2 fine
fine Teeth \vt\\ fet, and white as Ivory. After lie
had flumber'd, rather than ikpt, about hall" an
Hour, he wak'd again, and comes out of the Cave
to me; for I had been milking my Goats which I
had in the Enclofure juft by : When he efpy'd me,
he came running to me, laying hiuilelf down a.
gain upon the Ground, with all the polfible Signs
of an humble thankful Difpofition, making a
many antick Geftures to ihow it: At laft he lays
his Head flat upon the Ground, dole to my Poor,
and fets my other Foot upon his Head, as he had
done before ; and after this, made all the Signs to
me of Subjection, Servitude, and SubmifTion ima-
ginable, to let me know how he wculd fervemeas
long as he liv'd. I underftcod him in many Things,
and let him know I was very well pleas'd with
hinij in a little Time I began to fpeak to him,
and teach him to fpeak to me ^ and firft, I made
him know his Name Ihould be Fiiday, which was
the Day I fav'd his Life;' T call'd him fo for the
Memory of the Time ^ I likewife taught him to
fay Mafter, and then let him know that was to
be my Name ; I likewife taught him to fay Ta
md ATo, and to know the Meaning of them j I
*ave him fome Milk, in an earthen Pot, and 'let
aim.fee me drink it before him, and fop my
Bread, in it ^ and I gave him a Cake of Bread, to
lo the like, which he quickly comply'd with, and
nade Signs that it was very good for him-
I kept there with him all that Night, but as
bon as it was Day, Ibtckon'ci to him to come with
ne, and let him know I would give him fome
"loaths, at which he feem'd very glad, for he was
tark-naked : As we went by the Place "where he
ladbury'd the two Men,,he pointed exactly to
he Place, and fliew'd me the Marks that he hM
lade to find them again, making Signs to me
that
'•*. ••.«.'• T
that we mould dig them up again, and eat them j
at this I appear'd very angry, exprefs'd my Ab-
horrence of it, made as if I would vomit at the
Thoughts of it, and beckonYl with my Hand to
him to come away, which he did immediately,
with great Submiilion. i then led him up to thtf
Top of the Hill, to fee if his Enemies were gone'j
and pulling out my Glafs, I look'd and faw plain-
ly the Place where they had been, but no Appear-
ance of them, or of their Canoes ^ fo that it was
plain that they were gone, and had left their
two Comrades behind them, without any Search
after them.
But I was not content with this Difcovery, but
having now more Courage, and confequently more
Curiofity, I takes my Man Fiiday with me, giving
him the Sword in his Hand, with the Bow and
Arrows at his Back, which I found he could ufe
very dextroufly, making him carry one Gun for me,
and I two for myfelf, and away we march'd to the
Place, where thefe Creatures had been ; for I had
a Mind now to get fome fuller Intelligence of
them: When 1 came to the Place, my very Blood
ran chill in myrYeins, and my Heart funk within
me at the Horror. of the Spectacle: Indeed it was a
dreadful Sight, at leaft it wasfo tome, tho' Friday
made nothing of it: The Place was cover'd with^
human Bones, the Ground dy'd with their Blood,
great Pieces of Flelh left here and there, half
eaten, mangled and fcorch'd; and, in mort, all the
Tokens of the triumphant Feaft they had been
making there, after a Victory over their Enemies:
I faw three Skulls, five Hands,and the Bonesof three
or four Legs and Feet, and abundance of other Parts
of the Bodies; andFizVaj by his Signs, made me
underftand, that they brought over four Prifoners
to feaft upon, that three of them were eaten up,
R 3 and
and that he, pointing to himfelf, was the fourth:
That there had been a great "Battle between them,
and their next King, whofe Subjects, it feems, he had
been one of; and that they had taken a great Num-
ber of Prifbners, all which were carry'd to feveral
Places by thofe that had taken them in the Fight,
in order to feaft upon them, as was June here by
thefe Wretches upon thofe they brought hither.
I caus'd Friday to gather all the Skulls, Bones,
Flefli, and whatever remain'd, and lay them toge-
ther on a Heap, and make a great Fire upon it,
and burn them all to Allies: I found .Fn'ifojfhadftill
a hankering Stomach after fome of the Fiefh, and
was ftill a Cannibal in his Nature ; but I difco
ver'd fo mudi Abhorrence at the very Thoughts of
it, and at the leaft Appearance of it, that he durft
not difcover it ^ for I had, by fome Means, let him
know, that I would kill him if he offer'd it.
When we had done this, we came back to our
Caftle, and there I fell to work for my Man Friday;
and firft of all I gave him a Pair of Liuen Draw-
ers which I had out of the poor Gunner's Cheft I
mention'd, and which I found in the Wreck, and
which, with a little Alteration,fitted him very well;
then I made him a Jerkin of Goat's-fkin, as well as
my Skill would allow ^ and I was now grown a
tolerable good Taylor ; and I gave him a Cap,
which I had made of a Hare-fkin, very convenient,
and falhionable enough; and thus he was cloath d
for the prefent, tolerably well, and was mighty
well pleas'd to fee himfelf almoft as well cloath d
as his Mailer: It is true, he went awkardly in
thefe Things at firft : Wearing the Drawers was
very awkard to him, and the Sleeves of the Waft-
coat gall'd his Shoulders, and the Infide of his
Arms -, but a little eafing them, where he complain d
[ M7 J.
they hurt him, and ufing himfelf to them, at
length he took to them very well.
The next Day, after I came Home to my Hutch
with him, I began to confider where I fhould lodge
him ; and that I might do well for him, and yet be
perfectly eafy myfelf, I made a little Tent for him
in the vacant Place between my two Fortifications,
in the Infide of the laft, and in the Outfideof the
firft: And as there was a Door or Entrance there
into my Cave, I made a formal fram'd Door.cafe,
and a Door to it of Boards, and fet it up in the
PafTage, a little within the Entrance ^ and caufing
the Door to open on the Infide, I barr'd it up in
the Night, taking in my Ladders too -y fo that Fri-
day could no Way come at me in the Infide of my
innermoft Wall, without making fo much Noife in
getting over, that it muft needs waken me; for my
firft Wall had now a compleat Roof over it of long
Poles, covering all my Tent, and leaning up to the
Side of the Hill, which was again laid crofs with
fmaller Sticks inftead of Laths, and then thatch'd
over a great Thicknefs with the Rice Straw, which
was ftrong like Reeds j and at the Hole or Place
which was left to go in or out by the Ladder, I had
plac'd a kind of Trap-door, which if it had been
attempted on the Outfide, would not have open'd
at all, but would have fallen down, and made a
great Noife ; and as to Weapons, I took them all
in to my Side every Night.
But I needed none of all this Precaution ; for ne-
ver Man had a more faithful, loving, fincere Ser-
vant than Friday was to me ; without Pafllons,
Sullennefs, or Defigns, perfectly oblig'd and en-
gag'd ; his very Affections were ty'd to me, like
thofe of a Child to a Father ; and I dare fay, he
would have facrific'd his Life for the faving mine,,
upon any Occafion whatfbever j the many Teftinio.
R 4
nies he gave me of this, put it out of Doubt, and
foon convince! me, that I needed to ufe no Precau-
tions as to my Safety on his Account.
This frequently gave me Occafion to obferve,
and that with wonder, that however it had pleas'd
God in his Providence, and in the Government of
the Works of his Hands, to take from fo great a
Part of the World of his Creatures, thebeft Ufes to
which their Faculties and the Powers of their
Souls are adapted; yet that he has beftow'd upon
them the fame Powers, the fame Reafon, the fame
Affedions, the fame Sentiments of Kindnefs and
Obligation, the fame Paflions and Refentments
of Wrongs, the fame Senfe of Gratitude, Sinceri-
ty, Fidelity, and all the Capacities of doing Good,
and receiving Good, that he has given to us ; and
that when he pleafes to offer to them Occafionsof
exerting thefe, they are as ready, nay, more ready
to apply them to the right Ufes for which they
were beftow'd, than we are. And this made me
very melancholy fometimes, in reflecting, as the
feveral Occasions prefented, how mean a Ufe we
make of ail thefe, even though we have thefe Po-
wers enlighten'd by the great Lamp of Inftrudtion,
the Spirit of God, and by the Knowledge of his
Word added to our Underftanding; and why i£
has pleas'd God to hide the like faving Knowledge
from fo many Millions of Souls, who (if I might
judge by this poor Savage) would make a CHKS
better Ufe of it than we did.
From hence I fometimes was led' too far to
invade the Sovereignty of Providence, and, as it
were,arraignthe Juftice of fo arbitrary a Difpoiition
of Things, that mould hide that Light from feme,
and reveal it to others, and yet expect a like Du-
ty from both : But I fhut it up, and check'd my
Thoughts with this Conclufion, i ft, That we did
'.'". ...,;.,. , -'•...•.•'. ' • •• not
not know by what Light and Law thefe fhould be
condemn'd ; but that as God was neceflarily, and,.'
by the Nature of his Being, infinitely holy and
juft, fo it could not be, but that if thefe Crea-
tures were all fentfenc'd to Abfence from himfelf,
it was on Account of finning againft that Light,
which, as the Scripture fays, was a Law to them-
felves, and by fuch Rules as^their Confciences would
acknowledge to be juft, tho'the Foundation was not
difcover'd to us. And, 2dly, That ftill as we are all
the Clay in the Hand of the Potter, no VeljCelr
could fay to him, Why haft thou form'd me thus? •(
But to return to my new Companion : I was
greatly delighted with him, and made it my Bun"-.
nefs to teach him every Thing that was proper to
make him ufeful, handy, and helpful; but efpeci-
ally to make him fpeak, and tmderftand me when
I fpake j and he was the apteft Scholar that ever
was, and particularly was fo merry, fo conftant^y
diligent, and fo pleas'd, when he could but un-
derftand me or make me underftand him, that it
was very pleafant to me to talk to him .., and now
my Life began to be foeafy, that I began to fay to
myfelf, that could I but have been fare irom more
Savages, I cared not if I was never to remove from
the Place while I liv'd.
After I had been two or three Days return'd to
my Caftle, I thought that, in order to bring Friday
off from his horrid Way of Feeding, and from the
Relifli of a CanibaFs Stomach*, I ought to let him
tafte other Flefli j fo I took him out with me one
Morning to the Woods; I went, indeed, intending
to kill a Kid out of my own Flock, and bring him
home and drefs it: But as I was going, I faw
a She Goat lying down in the Shade, and two
young Kids fitting bv her ; I catch'd hold of Fri*
, hold,fays I, ftanclftill; and made Signs to him
not to ftir, immediately I prefented my Piece, ftiot
and kill'd one of the Kids. The poor Creature,
who had at a Diftance, indeed, feen me kill the
Savage, his Enemy, but did not know, or could
imagine, how it was done, was fenfibly furpriz'd,
trembled, and Ihook, and look'd fo amaz d, that
I thought he would have funk down. He did not
fee the Kid I had mot at, or perceive I had kilPd
it, but ripp'd up his Waftecoat to feel if he was
not wounded, and, as I found, prefently thought
I was refblv'd to kill him ; for he came and
kneel'd down to me, and embracing my knees,
faid a great many Things I did not underftand,
but I could eafily fee that the Meaning was to
pray me not to kill him.
I foon found a Way to convince him that I would
do him no Harm, and taking him up by the Hand,
laugh'd at him, and pointing to the Kid which I
had kiird, beckon'd to him to run and fetch it,
which he did ; and while he was wondering and
looking to fee how the Creature was kill'd, I load-
ed my Gun again, and by-and-by I faw a great
Fowl like a Hawk fit upon a Tree within Shot ;
fo, to let Friday underftand a little what I would do,
[ call'd him to me again, pointing at the Fowl,which
was indeed a Parrot, tho' I thought it had been a
Hawk $ I fay, pointing to the Parrot, and to myG»n,
and to the Ground under the Parrot, to let him fee
I would make it fall, I made him underftand that
I would {hoot and kill that Bird ; accordingly I
nYd, and bad him look, and immediately he faw
the Parrot fall ; he ftood like one frighted again,
notwithftanding all I had faid to him ^ and I found
he was the more amaz'd, becaufe he did not fee
me put anything into the Gun; but thought that
there muft be fome wonderful Fund of Death and
Deftruaion in that Thing, able to. kill Man, Beaft,
Bird,
Bird, or anything, near or far off; and the Afto-
nilhment this created in him was fuch, as could
not wear off for a long Time; and I believe, if I
would have let him, he would have worfhipp'd
me and my Gun: As for the Gun itfelf, he would
not fo much as touch it for (everal Days after; but
would fpeak to it, and talk to it, as if it had an-
fwer'd him, when he was by himfelf; wnich, as I
afterwards learn'd of him, was to defire it not to
-kill him.
Well: After his Aftonifliment was a little over
at this, I pointed to him to run and fetch the Bird
I had mot, which he did, but ftay'd Torn* Time 5
for the Parrot not being quite dead, was^tter'd
a good Way off from the Place where {he fell;
however, he found her, took her up, and brought v
her to me ; and, as I had perceiv'd his Ignorance
about the Gun before, I took this Advantage to
charge the Gun again, and not let him fee me do
it, that I might be ready for any other Mark that
might prefent; but nothing more offer'd at that
Time; fo I brought home the Kid, and the fame
Evening took the Skin off, and cut it out as well
as I could ; and having a Pot for that Purpofe, I
boil'd or ftew'd Ibme of the Flefh, and made
fome very good Broth ; and after I had begun to
eat fome, I gave fome to my Man, who feenui
very glad of it, and lik'd it very well; but that
which was ftrangeft to him was to fee me eat
Salt with it; he made a Sign to me, that the Salt
was not good to eat, and putting a little into his
own Mouth, he feem'd to naufeate it, and would
fpit and fputter at it, warning his Mouth with frefh
Water after it; on the other Hand, I took fome
Meat in my Mouth without Salt, and I pretended
to fpit and fputter for want of Salt, as faft as he
had done at the Salt; but it would not do, he
would
would never care for Salt with his Meat, or in his
Broth J at leaft, not a great while, and then but a
Very little.
Having thus fed him with boil'd Meat and
Broth, I was refolv'd to feaft him the next Day
with roafting a Piece of the Kid ; this I did by hang-
ing it before the Fire in a String, as I had feen
many People in Enghnd, fetting two Poles up,
one on each Mde the Fire, and one crofs on the
Top, and tying the String to the crofs Stick, letting
the Meat turn continually: This Friday admir'd
very much; but when he came to talk the Flefti,
he took fo many Ways to tell me how well he lik'd
it, that I could not but underftand him ; and at
laft he told me he would never eat Man's Fklh
any more, which I was very glad to hear.
The next Day I fet him to work to beating fome
Corn out, and mting it in the Manner I ufed to do,
as I obferv'd before; and he foon underftood how
to do it as well as I, efpecially, after he had feen
what the Meaning of it was, and that it was to
make Bread of; for after that I let him fee me
make my Bread, and bake it too, and in a little
Time Friday was able to do all the Work for me,
as well as I could do it myfelf.
I began now to confider, that having two Mouths
to feed inftead of one, I muft provide more Ground
for my Harveft, and plant a larger Quantity o*
Corn than I ufed to do ^ fo I mark'd out a larger
Piece of Land, and began the Fence in the fame
Manner as before, in which Friday not only work d
my willingly and very hard, but .did it very
:hearfully ; and I told him what it was for, that it
i/ras for Corn to make more Bread, becaufe he was
low. with me, and that I might have enough for
!iim' and myfelf too: He appear'd very fenfible ot
' it Part, and let me know that he thought I had i fi
inuch. I
much more Labour upon me on his Account, than
I had for my felt'; and that he would work the
harder for me, if I would tell him what to do.,
This was the pleafanteft Year of all the Life I led
in this Place: Friday began to talk pretty well, and
underftand the Names of almoft every Thing I had
Cccafion to call for, and of every Place I had to
fend him to, and talk a great deal to me ; fo that,
in fhort, I began now to have fome Ufe for my
Tongue again, which indeed I had very little Oc-
cafion for before y that is to faya about Speech: Be-
iides the Pleafure of talking to him, I had a flngu-
' lar Satisfa&ion in the Fellow himfelf ; his fimple
unfeign'd Honcfty appear'd to me more and more
. every Day. and I began really to love the Creature^
and on his Side, 1 believe he lov'd me more than it
was pcfiible for him ever to love any Thing before.
I had a Mind once to try if he had any hankering
Inclination to his own Country again ; and having
learn'd him Evglifh fo well, that he could anfwer me
almoftany Queftions, I afk'd him whether the Na-
" tion that he belong'd to never conquer'd in Battle ?
At which he fmil'd, and faid, Yes, yes, we always
fight the better ; that is, he mean'd always get the
better in Fight; and fo we began the following
Difcourfe: You always fight the better, faid I, How
came you to be taken Prifoner then, Friday?
Friday, My Nation beat much, for all that.
Mafter, How beat; if your Nation beat them,
how come you to be taken ?
Friday, They more many than my Nation in the
Place where me was ; they take one, two, three,
and me : my Nation over beat them in the yon-
der Place, where me no was; there my Natiou
take one, two, great Thoufand.
Majler, But why did not your Side recover you
from the Hands of your Enemies then ?
FriSq,
Friday, They run one, two, three, and me, and
make go in the Canoe ; my Nation have no Canoe f oi
that Time. a/
Mafter, Well, Friday, and what does your Na. gt
tion do with the Men they take, do they cany
them away, and eat them as thefe did ?
Friday, Yes, my Nation eat Mans too, eat all
up.
Mafter, Where do they carry them ?
Friday, Go to other Place, where they think.
Majler, Do thoy come hither ?
Friday, Yes, yes, they come hither; come other
elfe Place.
Mafter, Have you been here with them?
Friday, Yes, I been here ; [points to the N. W. Side
of the IJlaud, which it feems was their Side.]
By this I underitood, that my Man Fridca had
formerly been among the Savages, who uied to
come on Shore on the farther Part of the Ifland,
on the faid Man-eating Occafions that he was now
brought for; and fome Time after, when I took
the Courage to carry him to that Side, being the
fame I formerly mention'd, he prefently knew
the Place, and told me, he was there once when
they eat up twenty Men, two Women, and one
Child: He could not tell twenty in EngliJI); but
he numbred them by laying fo many Stones on a
Row, and pointing to me to tell them over.
I have told this Paflage, becaufe it introduces
what follows ; that after I had had this Difcourle
.vith him, I ask'd him how far it was from our
ffland to the Shore, and whether the Canoes were
lot often loft; he told me, there was no Danger,
10 Canoes ever loft; but that after a little Way out
:o the Sea, there was a Current, and a Wind, al-
vays one Way in the Morning, the other in the
Afternoon.
This
This I underftood to be no more than the Sets
of the Tide, as going out, or coming in; but I
afterwards underftood it was occafion'd by the
great Draft and Reflux of the mighty River Oroo-
ttooko ; in the Mouth or the Gulf of which River,
as I found afterwards, our Ifland lay; and this
Land, which I perceivM to the W. and N. W. was
the great Ifland Trinidad, on the N. Point of the
Mouth of the River. I afk'd Friday a thoufand
Queftions about the Country, the Inhabitants, the
Sea, the Coaft, and what Nation were near; he
told me all he knew, with the greateft Opennefs
imaginable. I alk'd him the Names of the feveral
Nations of his Sort of People, but could get no o-
ther Name than Caribs ; from whence I eafily un-
derftood, that thefe were the Caribbees, which our
Maps place on that Part of America which reaches
from the Mouth of the River Oroonooko to Guiana,
and onwards to St. Martha: He told me, that up a
great Way beyond theMoon, that was, beyond the
Setting of the Moon, which muft be Weft from
their Country, there dwelt white bearded Men,
like me, and pointed to my great Whifkers, which
I mention'd before ; and that they had kill'd much
Mans, that was his Word: By all which I under-
ftood, he mean'd the Spaniards, whofe Cruelties in
America had been fpread over the whole Countries,
and was remember'd by all the Nations, from Fa-
ther to Son.
I enquir'd if he could, tell me how I might come
from this Ifland, and get among thofe white Men;
he told me, yes, yes, I might go in two Canoe; I
could not underftand what he meant, or make him
defcribe to me what he meant by two Canoe, 'till at
laft, with great Difficulty, I found he meant it muft
be in a large great Boat, as big as two Canoes.
This
Thb Part of Fridays Difcourfe began to relifli
with me very well, and from this Time I enter-
tain'd fome Hopes, that one Time or other I
might find an Opportunity to make my Efcape
from this Place; and that this poor Savage might
be a Means to help me to do it.
During the long Time that Friday has now bee»
with me, and that he began to fpeak to me, and
underftand me, J was not wanting to lay a Foun-
dation of religious Knowledge in his Mind; par-
ticularly, I aik'd him one Time, Who made him?
The poor Creature did not underftand me at all,
but thought I had afk'd who was his Father: But
I took it by another Handle, and afk'd him who
made the Sea, the Ground we walk'd on, and the
Hills and Woods; he told me it was one old &•
vamvckee, that liv'd beyond all: He could defcribe
nothing of this great Perfon, but that he was very
old ; much older, he faid, than the Sea or the Land.
than the Moorj or the Stars: I afk'd him then, H
this old Perfon had made all Things, why did not
all Things worfhip him > He look'd very gra^e,
and with a perfedt Look of Innocence, faid, All
Things faid 0 to Mm: I afk'd. him if the People,
who die in his Country, went away anywhere?
He faid, Yes, they all went to Benamuckee : Then
I afk'd him, Whether thefe they eat up went thi-
ther too ? He faid, Yes.• . .
From thefe Things I began to inftruft him, in
the Knowledge of the true God. I told him, That
the great Maker of all Things liv'd up there,
pointing up towards Heaven: That he governs
the World by the fame Power and Providence by
which he had made it: That he -was Omnipotent,
could do every Thing for us, give every Thing to
us, take every Thing from us; and thus, by De-
grees, I open'd his Eyes. He liften'd with great At-
^ tention
tention, and receiv'd with Pleafure the Notion of
jfeftu thrift, being fent to redeem us, and of the
Manner of making our Prayers to God, and his
being able to hear us, even into Heaven. He told
me one Day, that if our God could hear us up be-
yond the Sun, he muft needs be a greater God than
their Brnamnckee, who liv'd but a little Way off,
and yet could not hear,'till they went up to the
great Mountains where he dwelt, to fpeak to him:
I ask'd him if ever he went thither, to fpeak to
him? He faid, No, they never went that were
young Men; none went thither but the old Men,
who he call'd their Oowokakee, that is, as I made
him explain it to me, their Religious, or Clergy,
and that they went to fay 0, (fo he call'd faying
Prayers) and then came back, and told them
what Benamuckee faid. By this I obferv'd, That
there is Prie/tcraft, even amongft the moft blinded
ignorant Pagans in the World; and the Policy of
making a fecret Religion, in Order to preferve the
Veneration of the People to the Clergy, is not on-
ly to be found in the Roman, but perhaps among
all Religions in the World, even among the moft
brutifti and barbarous Savages.
I endeavour'd to clear up this Fraud to my
Man Friday, and told him, That the Pretence of
their old Men going up to the Mountains to fay O
to their God Benamuckfe. was a Cheat, and their'
bringing Word from thence what he faid, was
much more fo ; that if they met with any Anfwer,
or fpoke with any one there, it muft be with an
evil Spirit: And then I enter'd into a long Di£
courfe with him about the Devil, the Original of
him, his Rebellion againft God, his Enmity to
Man, the Reafon of it, his fetting himfelf up in
the dark Parts of the World to be worfbipM in-
ftead of God, and as God; and the many Strata-
S gems
gems he made Ufe of to delude Mankind to their
Ruin ; how he had a fecret Accefs to our Patfions,
and to our Affe&ions, to adapt his Snares fo to our
Inclinations, as to caufe us even to be our own
Tempters, and to run upon our Deftrudtion by our
own Choice.
I found it was not fb eafy to imprint right No-
tions in his Mind about the Devil, as it was about
the Being of a God. Nature aflifted all my Argu-
ments to evidence to him even the NeceJfityoia
great firft Caufe and over.ruling governing Power,
a fecret directing Providence, and of the Equity
andjuftice of paying Homage to him that made
us, and the like. But there appear'd nothing of all
this in the Notion of an evil Spirit, of his Ori-
ginal, his Being, his Nature, and above all, of his
Inclination to do Evil, and to draw us in to do
fo too. And the poor Creature puzzl'd me once
in fuch a Manner, by a Queftion meerly natural
and innocent, that I fcarce knew what to fay to
him. I had been talking a great deal to him of
the Power of God, his Omnipotence, his dreadful
Averfionto Sin, his being a confuming Fire to the
Workers of Iniquity; how, as he had made us all,
he could deftroy us and all the World in a Mo-
ment ^ and he lifreu'd with great Serioufnefs to me
all the while.
After this, I had been telling him how the De-
vil was God's Enemy in the Hearts of Men, and
ufed all his Malice and Skill to defeat the good
Defigns of Providence, and to ruin the Kingdom
of Chrift in the World, and the like. Well, fays
Friday, but you fay, God is fo ftrong, fo great,
is he not much ftrong, much Might as the Devil?
Yes, yes, fays I, Friday, God is ftronger than the
Devil, Gcd is above the Devil, and therefore we
pray to God to tread him down under our Feet,
and
f
and enable us to refift his Temptations, and
qttench his fiery Darts. But, fays he again, if
God much ftrong, much Might as the Devil, why God
no kill the Devil, fo make Vim no more do wicked.
I was ftrangely furpriz'd at his Queftion, and
after all, tho' 1 was now an old Man, yet I was
but a young Doctor, and ill enough qualify'd for
a Cafuift, or a Solver of Difficulties : £nd, at firft, 0
I could not tell what to fay, fo I pretended not to
hear him, and ask'd him what he faid? But he
was too earneft for an Anfwer to forget his Que-
ftion ; fothat he repeated it in the very fame broken
Words, as above. By this Time I had recovered
myfeli a little, and I faid, God will at laft pum/j
him fever ely, be is refervd for the Judgment, and h
to be caft into the Bottomlefs Pit, to dwell with ever-
lafting Fire. This did not fatisfy Friday, but he
returns upon me, repeating my "Words, RESERVE
AT LAST, me no underJland, But, Why -not kill the
Devil -now, not kill great ago? You may as well ask
me, faid /, Why God does not kill you and I,
when we do wicked Things here that offend him ?
We are prelerv'd to repent and be pardon'd : He
mufes a while at this $ Well, well, fays he, mighty
affectionately, that well ; fo you, I, Devil, all wick-
ed, all prtfcrve, repent, God pardon all. Here I was
run down again by him to the laft Degree, and it
was a Teftimony to me, how the meer Notions of
Nature, though they will guide reafbnable Crea-
tures to the Knowledge of a God, and of a Wor-
fhip or Homage due to the fupreme Being of God,
as theConfeqiience of our Nature; yet nothing but
divine Revelation can form the Knowledge of Je-
fns Chift, and of a Redemption purchas'd for us, of a
Mediator ofthe new CoVenant,and of an Tnterceflbr,
&t the Footstool of God's Throne ., I fay, nothing
out a RevelEfttoh from Heaven, can form thefe in
S 2 the
the Soul} and that therefore the Gofpel of our
Lord and Saviour Jefm Ckrtft, I mean, the Word
of God, and the Spirit of God, promis'd for the
Guide and Sandifier of his People, are the abfo-
lutely neceflary Inftrudtors of the Souls of Men,
in the faving Knowledge of God, and the Means
of Sal ration.
I therefore diverted the prefent Difcourfe be-
tween me and my Man, rifing up haftily, as upon
fome Hidden Occafion of going out; then fending
him for fomething a good Way off,I ferioufly pray'd
„ to God, that he would enable me to inftrudt faving-
ly this poor Savage, ailifting by his Spirit the
Heart of the poor ignorant Creature, to receive
the Light of the Knowledge of God in Cbrijl, re-
conciling him to himfelf, and would guide me lp
fpeak fo to him from the Word of God, as his
Confcience might be convinc'd, his Eyes open'd,
and his Soul fav'd. When he came again to me, I
entred into a long Difcourfe with him upon the
Subjed of the Redemption of Man by the Saviour
of the World, and of the Podrineof the Gofpel
preach'd from Heaven, viz. of Repentance towards
God, and Faith in our blefTed Lord Jefus. I then
explain'd to him, as well as I could, why our
Blefled Redeemer took not on him the Nature of
Angels, but the Seed ef Abraham, and how for
that Reafon the fallen Angels had no Share in the
Redemption ^ that he came only to the loft Sheep
of the Houfe of Ifrael, and the like.
I had, God knows, more Sincerity than Know-
ledge, in all the Methods I took "for this poor
Creature's Inftruflion, and muft acknowledge what
I believe all that ad upon the fame Principle will
find, That in laying Things open to him, I really
inform'd and inftrudedrnyfelfinmanyThings,that
either I did not know, or had not fully confider'd
before;
 before, but which occurr'd naturally to my Mind,
upon my (earthing into them, for the Information
of this poor Savage} and I had more Affection in
my Enquiry after Things upon this Occafion, than
ever I telt before ; fo that whether this poor wild
Wretch was the better for me, or no, I had great
Reafon to be thankful that ever he came to me:
My Grief fate lighter upon me, my Habitation
grew comfortable to me beyond Meafurej and
vvhen I reflected that in this folitary Life, which I
had been V;onfin'd to, I had not only been mov'd
myfelfto lookup to Heaven, and to feek to the
Hand that had brought me there; but was now
to be made an Inftrument under Providence to fave
the Life, and, for ought I know, the Soul of a poor
Savage, and bring him to the true Knowledge of
Religion, and of the Chriftian DoSrine, that he
might knowChriftJefus, to knowbom is Life eter-
nal ; I fay, When I reflected upon all thefe Things,
a fecret Joy run through every Part of my Soul,
and I frequently rejoic'd that ever I was brought to
this Place, which I had fo often thought the moft
dreadful of all Affli&ions that could poffibly have
befallen me.
In this thankful Frame I continu'd all the Re*
tnainder of my Time, and the Converfation which
employ'd the Hours between Friday and I, was
fuch, as made the three Years which we liv'd there
together perfectly and compleatly happy Jfanyfmb
Thing as complcat Happinefs can be forma in a fvllv-
nary State. The Savage was now a good Chrifti-
an, a much better than I; though I have Reafon
to hope, and blefs God for it, that we were equally
penitent, and comforted reftor'd Penitents; we
had here the Word of God to read, and no farther
off from his Spirit to inftrua, than if we had been
• in England.
83 I always
I always apply'd myfelf to reading the Scrip-
ture, to let him know, as well as I could, the
Meaning of what I read; and he again, by his fe.
rious Enquiries and Queftions, made me, as I
[aid before, a much better Scholar in the Scripture
Knowledge, than I Ihould ever have been by my
own private meer Reading. Another Thing I can-
not refrain from obferving here alfo from Experi-
ence, in this rctir'd Part of my Life, viz. How in-
finite and ineypreiftble a BlelFmg it is, that the
Knowledge of God, and of the Dodrine of Salva-
tion by Cbrift Jefm, is fo plainly laid down in the
Word of God, fo eafy to be receiv'd and under-
Rood, that as the bare Reading the Scripture
made me capable of understanding enough of
my Duty, to carry me directly on to the great
Work of fincere Repentance for my Sins, and lay-
ing hold of a Saviour for Life and Salvation, to a
Mated Reformation in Practice, and Obedience to
all God's Commands, and this without any Tegch.

As to all the Difputes, Wranglings, Strife, and

Religion, whether Niceties in Doctrines, or Schemes
of Church Government, they were all perfectly ufe*

Knowledge of the difputed Points in Religion,
which have made fuch Confufions in the World,
would have been to us, if we could have obtain'd

Things, and take every Part in its Order.
After Friday and I became more intimately ac-
quainted, and that he could underftand almoft all
1 laid to him, and fpeak fluently, tho3 in broken
EygliJI), to me ; I acquainted him with my own
Story, or at leaft fo much of it as related to my
coming into the Place, how I had liv'd there, and
how long. I let him into the Mtyftery, for fuch
jt was to him, of Gunpowder and Bullet, and
taught him how to moot : I gave him a Knife,
which he was wonderfully delighted with, and I
made him a Belt, with a Frog hanging to it, fuch
as in ErgUrid we wear Hangers in -^ and in the Frog,
inftead of 3 Hanger, I gave him a Hatchet, which
was not only as good a Weapon in Ibme Cafes, but
much more ufeful upon other Occafions.
I defcrib'd' to him the Country of Europe, and
particularly F.itgland, which I came from; how we
liv'd, how we worlhipp'd God, how we behav'd
to onp another ; and how we traded in Ships to all
Parts of the World : I gave him an Account of the
Wreck'which I had been on board of, aiid fliew'd
him, as near as I could, the Place where me lay ;
but me was all beaten in Pieces before, and gone.
I fhew'd'him the Ruins of our Boat, which we
loft when we efcap'd, and which I could not ftir
with my whole Strength then, but was now fallen
almoft all to Pieces: Upon feeing this Boat, Friday
ftood muling a great while, and faid nothing; I
afk'd him what it was he ftudyxl upon; at laft, fays
he, mefeefncb Boat like come io Place at my Nation.
I did not imderftand him a good while ; but at
laft, when I had examin'd farther into it, I under-
S 4 flood
[rood by him, that a Boat, fuch as that had been, fuc
:ame on Shore upon the Country where he liv'd, in |
that is, as he explain'd it, was driven thither by J
Strefsof Weather: I prefently imagin'd, that fome bei
European Ship muft have been caft away upon their ' of
Coaft, and the Boat might get loofe, and drive a- in i
Riore, but was fo dull, that I never once thought of
of Men making Efcape from a Wreck thither, much loc
lefs whence they might come 5 fb I only enquir'd in
after a Defcription of the Boat. an<
Friday defcrib'd the Boat to me well enough; but froi
brought me better to understand him, when he ad- 0,
ded with fome Warmth, wefave the white Mans from fAe».'
drovn: Then I prefently aik'd him, if there was a- (
ny white Mans, as he call'd them, in the Boat: Tes, pea
he faid, tie Boat full of white Mans: I afk'd him Co
how many ^ he told upon his Fingers feventeen: he
[ afk'd him then, what became of them ; he told an(
me, thy live, they dwell at my Nation. Th
This put new Thoughts into my Head ; for I eal]
prefently imagin'd, that thefe might be the Men and
belonging to the Ship that was caft away in Sight I bac
sf my Ifland, as I now call it ; and who, after the | f0r,
Ship was ftruck on the Rock, and they faw her j me
inevitably loft, had fav'd themfelves in their Boat,
md were landed upon that wild Shore, among the
savages. | Fes
Upon this, I enquir'd of him more critically il he
•vhat was become of them; he affur'd me they the
iiv'd ftill there; that they had been there about
bur Years ; that the Savages let them alone, an<J
jave them Victuals to live. I afk'd him, how it
rame to pafs they did not kill them and eat them ; | fQ
he faid, No, they make Brother with them ; that is,
is I underftood him, a Truce : And, then he ad-
led, Tbe% no eat Mans but when make the VaY fykt: ne
That is to fay, they never eat any Men, but
fuch
[ if J
fuch as come to fight with them, and are taken
in Battle.
It was after this, fome confiderable Time, that
being on the Top of the Hill, at the Eaft Side
of the Ifland, from whence, as I have faid, I had
in a clear Day difcover'd the Main, or Continent
of Amenw: Friday, the Weather being very ferene,
looks very earneftly towards the main Land, and
in a kind' of Surprize, falls a jumping and dancing,
and calls out to me, for I was at fome Diftance
from him: I afk'd him what was the Matter $
0, Joy ! fays he, 0 Glad ! There fee my Country,
there my Nation!
I obferv'd an extraordinary Senfe of Pleafareap-
pear'd in his Face, and his Eyes fparkled, and his
Countenance difcover'd a flrange Eagernefs, as if
he had a Mind to be in his own Country again ;
and this Obfervation of mine put a great many
Thoughts into me, which made me at firft not fo
eafy about my new Man Friday as I was before;
and I made no Doubt, but that if Friday could get
back tp his own Nation again, he would not only
forget all his Religion, but all his Obligation to
me, and would be forward enough to give his
Countrymen an Account of me, and come back per-
haps, with a hundred or two of them, and make a
Feaft upon me, at which he might be as merry as
he u(ed to be with thofe of his Enemies, when
they were taken in War.
But I wrong'd the poor honeft Creature very
much, for which I was very forry afterwards.
However, as my Jealoufy increas'd, and held me
fome Weeks, I was a little more circumfpecl:, and
not fo familiar and kind to him as before; in
which I was certainly in the Wrong too, the ho-
neft grateful Creature having no Thought about it,
but what confifted with the beft Principles, both
as
as a religious Chriftian, and as a grateful Friend,
as appear'd afterwards to my full Satisfaction.
While my Jealoufy of him lafted, you may be
fure I was every Day pumping him, to fee if he
would difcover any of the new Thoughts which I
fufpeded were in him \ but I found every Thing
he fa :d was fo honeft, and fb innocent, that I
could find nothing to nourim my Sufpirion ; and,
in fpite of all my Uneafinefs, he made me at laft
entirely his own again, nor did he in the leal!
perceive that I was uneafy, and therefore I could
not fufpect him of Deceit.
One Day walking up the fame Hill, but the
Weather being haizy at Sea, fo that we could not
fee the Continent, I call'd to him, and faid, Fri-
<foy, do not you wifh yourfelf in your own Coun-
try, your own Nation > Tes, he faid, / be mucb 0
glad to be at my own Ration. What would you do
there, faid I, would yon torn wild again, eat Mens
Fleth again, and be a Savage as you were before ?
He look'd full of Concern, and lhaking his Head,
Paid, No, -n0, Friday tell them to live good, tell Am
to pray God, tell them to eat Corn-Bread, Cattle-Fle/b,
Milk, no eat Man again : Why then, faid I to him,
They mil kill yon. He look'd grave at that, and
;hen faid. No, they .no kill me. they willing love learn:
He meant by this, they would be willing to learn.
He added, they learn'd much of the Bearded Mans
:hat come in the Boat. Then I afk'd him if he
vould go back to them ? He fmil'd at that, and
old me he could not fwim fo far. I told him I
A'ould make a Canoe for him. He told me, he
vould go if I would go with him. I go! fays K
tfhy, they will eat me if I come there ? No, >»,
ays he, me make they m eat you, me make thy vncb
eve yov. He meant, he would tell them how I hart
:ill'd his Enemies, and fav'd his Life, and fo he
.• •
would make them love me; then he told me, as
well as he could, how kind they were to feventeeji
white Men, or bearded Men, as he call'd them,
who came on Shore there in Diftrefs.
From this Time, I confefs, I had a Mind to
venture over, and fee if I could poflibly join with
thefe bearded Men, who, I made no Doubt, were
Spaniards or Portuguefe; not doubting but, if I could,
we might find fome Method to efcape from
thence, being upon the Continent, and a good
Company together, better than I could from an
Ifland 40 Miles off the Shore, and alone without
Help. So, after fome Days, I took Friday to work
again, by way of Difcourfe, and told him I would
give him a Boat to go back to his own Nation ,
and accordingly I carry'd him to my Frigate,
which lay on the other Side of the Ifland, and ha-
ving clear'd it of Water, for I always kept it funk
in the Water, I brought it out, fhew'd it him, and
we both went into it.
I found he was a moft dextrous Fellow at ma-
naging it, would make it go almoft as fwift and
faft again as I could; fo when he was in, I faid to
him, Well, now, Friday, {hall we go to your Na-
tion ? He look'd very dull at my faying fo, which,
it feems, was, becaufe he thought the Boat. too
fmall to go fo far. I told him then I had a bigger-,
fo the next Day I went to the Place where the
firft Boat lay which I had made, but which I could
not get into Water : He faid that was big enough j
but then, as I had taken no Care of it, and it had
lain two or three and twenty Years there, the Sun
had fplit and dry'd it, that it was in a Manner
rotten. Friday told me,- fuch a Boat would do ve-
ry well, and would carry much enough Vittk, Drittk,
fyead, that H^S his Way of Talking. {
*•..', •• . *..,... .,..,. .... '
Upon the whole, I was by this Time fo fix'd
upon my ,T)efign of going over with him to the
Continent, that I told him we would go and make
one as big as that, and he fhould go home in it.
He anfwer'd not one Word, but look'd very grave
and fad : I aik'd him what was the Matter with
him; he aflt'd me again thus, ffby you angry mad
with Friday, vbat me done ? I alk'd him what he
meant; I told him I was not angry with him at all.
No ottgry! No angry! fays he, repeating the Words
feveral Times, Why fend Friday borne away to ntj
Nation ? Why, fays I, Friday, did you not lay you
wifh'd you were there ? Tes, yes, fays he, wijb be botb
there, no viJJi Friday there, no Majler tltre. In a
Word, he would not think of going there without
me: I go there, Friday, fays I, what fhall I do
there ? He turn'd very quick upon me at this: Ton
do great deal much Good, fays he, you teach wild Maffi
te good fober tame Mam ; you tell them know Got,
fray God, and live new Life. Alas, Friday, fays I,
thou knoweft not what thou fay'ft, I am but an
ignorant Man myfelf. Tes, yes, fays he, you teacki
me Geod, you teachee them Good. No, no, Friday,
fays I, you (hall go without me; leave me here to
live by myfelf, as I did before. He look'd confus'd
again at that Word, and running to one of the
Hatchets which he ufed to wear, he takes it up
haftily, and gives it me, What muft I do with this?
fays I to him : Tou take kill Friday, fays he:
What mufl: I kill you for ? faid I again. He re-
turns very quick, Wbtrt you fend Friday away
for ? take kill Friday, no fend Friday emay. This
he fpoke fo earneftly, that I faw Tears ftand
in his Eyes. In. a Word, I fq plainly difcover'd
the utmoft Affection in him to me, and a firm Re-
folution in him, that I told him then, and often
after, that I would never fend him away from
, if he was willing to flay with me.
Upon the whole, as I found by all his Difcourfe
a fettled Affedtion to me, and that nothing fhould
part him from me, fo I found all the Foundation
of his Delire to go to his own Country, was laid
in his ardent Affection to the People, and his Hopes
of my doing them Good ; a Thing which as I had
no Notion of myfelf, fo I had not the leaft Thought,
or Intention, or Defire of undertaking it. But ftill
I found a ftrong Inclination to my attempting an
•Efcape, as above, founded on the Suppofition ga-
ther'd from the Difcourfe, (viz.) That there were
feventeen bearded Men there; and therefore, with-
out any more Delay, I went to work with Friday
to find out a great Tree proper to fell, and make a
large Periagua or Canoe to undertake the Voyage.
There were Trees enoagh in the Ifland to have
built a little Fleet, not of Periaguas and Canoes,
but even of good large VefTels. But the main Thing
I look'd at, was to get one fo near the Water, that
we might launch it when it was made, to avoid
the Miftake I committed at firft.
At laft, Friday pitch'd upon a Tree, for I found he
knew much better than I what Kind of Wood was
fitteft for it; nor can I tell, to this Day,what Wood
to call the Tree we cut down, except that it was
very like the Tree we call Fvjlic, or between that
and the Nicaragua Wood, for it was much of the
fame Colour and Smell. Friday was for burning the
Hollow or Cavity of this Tree out to make it for
a Boat: But I fhew'd him how rather to cut it out
with Tools; which, after I had fhew'd him how
to ufe,hedid very handily, and in about a Month's
hard Labour we finifh'd it, and made it very
handfbme, efpecially when with our Axes, which I
fhew'd him how to handle, we cut and hew'd the
Out-fide into the true Shape of a Boat; after this,
however, it coft us near a Fortnight's Time to get
her
,7o
her along, as it were, Inch by Inch upon great I
Rowlersinto the Water. But when fhe was in, {he Wor
would have carry'd twenty Men with gtefct for I
Eafe. Stay
When fhe was in the Water, and tho' fhe wasfo ihou
big, it amaz'd me to fee with what Dexterity and thai
how fwift my Man Friday would manage her, turn ftee
her, and paddle her along; fo I aik'd him if he wri;
would, and if we might venture over in her ^ Tes, he Nee
faid, be venter over in Iter very well, tbo'great blov- foij]
Wind. However, I had a farther Defign that he pafs,
knew nothing of, and that was to make a Mail and I bat]
Sail, and to fit her with an Anchor and Cable: As mud
to a Maft, that was eafy enough to get; fo I pitch'd AJ
upon a ftrait yofing Cedar-Tree, which I found day
near the Place, and which there was great Plenty of
of in the Ifland.; and I fet Friday to work to cut it pad<
down, and gave him Directions how to fhape and a
order it. But as to the Sail, that was my particular
Care ; I knew I had old Sails, or rather Pieces of
old Sails enough ; but as I had had them now fill'd
26 Years by me, and had not been very care. chan;
ful to preferve them, not imagining that I fhould one a
ever have this kind of life for them, I did not doubt
but they were all rotten/ and indeed moft of them
were fo j however, I found two Pieces which ap- Cpm
pear'd pretty good, and with thefe I went to work, ot
and with a great deal of Pains, and awkward tedi-
ous ftitching (you may be fure) for Want of Needks,
I at length made a Three-corner'd ugly Thing, Me
what we call in England, a Shoulder of Mutton
Sail, to go with. a Boom at Bottom, and a little
fhort Sprit at the Top, fuch as ufually our Ships the:
Long-Boats fail with, and fuch as I heft knew how
to manage; becaufe it was fuch a one. as I had to
the Boat in which I made my Efcape frofn Bar.-
bary, as related in the firft Part of my Story.
Iwa?
*7.«
I was near two Months performing this laft
Work, viz. rigging and fitting my Maft and Sails j
for I finifh'd them very compleat, making a fmall
Stay, and a Sail, or Forefail to it, to aflift, if we
ihould turn to Windward; and which was more
than all, I fix'd a Rudder to the Stern of her, to
fteer with; and tho11 was but a bungling Ship-
wright, yet as I knew the Ufefulnefs, and even
Neceffity of fuch a Thing, I apply'd myfelf with
fo much Pains to do it, that at laft I brought it to
pafs, tho' confidering the many dull Contrivances
I had for it that fail a, I think it coft me almoft as
much Labour as making the Boat.
After all this was done too, I had my Man Fri-
day to teach as to what belong'd to the Navigation
of my Boat; for tho' he knew very well how to
paddle a Canoe, he knew nothing what belong'd to
a Sail and a Rudder, and Was the moft ama'zd
when he faw me work the Boat too and again in
the Sea by the Rudder, and how the Sail gyb'd, and
fill'd this Way or that Way, as the Courfe we fail'd
chang'd; I fay, when he faw this, he ftood like
one aftonim'd and amaz'd: However, with a little
Ufe, I made all thefe Things familiar to him ; and
he became an expert Sailor, except that as to the
Compafs, ILfould make him underftand very little
of that. On the other Hand, as there was very little
cloudy Weather, and feldom or never any Fogs in
thofe Parts, there was the lefs Occafion for a Com-
pafs, feeing the Stars were always to be feen by
Night, and the Shore by Day, except in the rainy
Seafons, and then no Body cared to ftir abroad, ei-
ther by Land or Sea.
I was now enter'd on the feven and twentieth
Year of my Captivity in this Place ^ tho1 the
three laft Years that I had this Creature with me,
ought rat her to be left out of the Account, my Ha-
bitation
bitation being quite of another Kind than in all the
reft of the Time. I kept the Anniverfary of my
landing here with the fame Thankfulnefs to God
for his Mercies, as at firft ^ and if I had fuch Caufe
of Acknowledgment at firft, I had much more Co
now, having fnch additional Teftimonies of the
Care of Providence over me, and the great Hopes
I had of being effedrually and fpeedily deliver'd;
for I had an invincible Impreffion upon my
Thoughts, that my Deliverance was at hand, and
that I mould not be another Year in this Place:
However, I went on with my Hufbandry, digging,
planting, fencing, as ufual; Igather'daridcur'dmy
Grapes, and did every nee efiary Thing, as before.
The rainy Seafon was in the mean Time upon
me, when I kept more within Doors than at other
Times j fo I had ftow'd our new VefTel as fecure as
we could, bringing her up into the Creek, where,
as I faid in the Beginning, I landed myRafts from
the Ship, and haling her up to the Shore, at High
Water Mark, I made my Man Friday dig a little
Dock, juft big enough to hold her, and juft deep e-
nough to give her Water enough to float in ; a«"
then, when the Tide was out, we made a ftroflg
Dam crofs the End of it, to keep the Water out;
and fo fhe lay dry, as to the Tide, from the Sea;
and to keep the Rain off, we laid a great many
Boughs of Trees, fo thick, thai fhe was as well
thatch'd as a Houfe ; and thus we waited for the
Month of November and December, in which I de-
(ign'd to make my Adventure.
When the fettled Seafon began to come in, as
rhe Thought of my De%n return'd with the fair
Weather, I was preparing daily for the Voyage;
md the firft Thing I did, was to lay by a certain
Quantity of Provifions, being the Stores for our
Voyage j and intended, in a Week or a Fortnight"
Time,
Time, to open the Dock, and launch out our Boaf.
1 was bufy one Morning upon Ibme Thing of this
kind, when I call'd to Friday, and bid him go to the
i-'ea Shore, and fee if he could find a Turtle, or
Tortoife, a Thing which we generally got once a
Week, for the Sake of the Lggs, as well as the
Flelh: Fi Iday had not been long gone, when he
came running back, and flew over my outer Wall,
or Fence, like one that felt not.the Ground, or the
Steps he fet his Feet on j and before I had Time to
fpeak to him, he cries out to me, 0 Majler ! Ma-
Jler! 0 Sorrow ! 0 bad! What's the Matter, Friday,
fays I ; 0 ywder, tbsre, fays he, one, two, three Canoe !
otie, two, three! By his way of fpeaking, I conclu-
ded these were fix ; but on Enquiry I found it was
but three: Well, Friday, fays 1, do not be frighted 5
fo I hearten'd him up as well as I could: However,
1 faw the poor Fellow was inoft teiribly fcaAl; for
nothing ran in his Head but that they were come to
look for him, and would cut him in Pieces, and eat
him; and the poor Fellow trembled fo, that I
fcarce knew what to do with him : I comforted him
as well as I could, and told him I was in as much
Danger as lie, and that they would eat me as well as
him., but, fays I, Friday, we mift.refvlve tofyht ibem\
Can you fglt, Friday ? Me Jboot, fays he, but there
come many great Number. No matter for that, laid
I again, our Guns will fright them that we do not
kill ;. fo I aik'd him, Whether if I refolv'd to defend
him, he would defend me, and ftand by me, and do
jultas I bid him? He faid, Me die, when you bid djer
Maftcri fo I went and fetch'd a good* Dram of
ftum, and gave him; for I h,ad been fo good a Huf-
band of rny Rum, that I had a great deal left:
When he had drank it, I made him tak£ the two
Fowling-Pieces, which we alWays carry'd, and Ioa4 '
them with large Swan-Shot, as big as fmall Piftol
T' BulletS i
Bullets } then I took four Mufkets, and loaded them
with two Slugs, ana five fmall Bullets each; and
my two Piftols I loaded with a Brace of Bullets
each; I hung my great .v word as ufual, naked by
my Side, and gave Friday his Hatchet.
When I had thus prepar'd my fe if, I took my Per-
fpedive-Glafs, and went up to the Side of the Hill,
to fee what I could diicover ; and I found quickty,
b}r my Glafs, that tfiere were one and twenty Sava-
ges, three Prifoners, and three Canoes-, and that
their whole Bufinefs feem'd to be the triumphant
Banquet upon thefe three humane Bodies, (a barba-
rous fieaft indeed) but nothing more than as I had
obferv'd was ufual with them.
lobferv'd alfo, that they were landed not where
the)' had done when Friday made his Efcape, but
nearer to my Creek, where the Shore was low, and
where a thick Wood came clofe almoft down to the
S2a : This, with the Abhorrence of the inhumane
Errand thefe Wretches cam'e about, fill'd me with
fuch Indignation, that I came down again to Fridfy
and told him, I was refolv'dto go down to them,
and kill them all; andaiVd him if he would ftand
by me> He had now gotten over his Fright, and
his Spirits being a little rais'd with the Dram I had
given him, he was very chearful, and told me, as
before, fee would die, when I bid die.
In this Fit of Fury, I took firft and divided the
Arms which I had charg'd, as before, between us:
I gave FJ iday one Piftol to flick in his Girdle, and
three Guns upon his Shoulder ; and I took oue Pi-
frof, and the other three rrry felf; and in this Po.
fture we marcVd out: I took a fmall Bottle of Rum
in my Pocket, and gave Friday a large Bag, with
more Powder and Bullet:, and, as to Orders, 1
rharg'd him to keep clofe behind 'me, and not to
ftir, or (hoot, or do any Thing, till 1 bid him; and
C..*7J]
in the mean Time, not to fpeak a Word : In this
Pofture I fetch'd a Compafs to my Right Hand of
near a Mile, as well to get over the Creek, as to
get into the Wocd ;, fo that Tmight cume within
Shot of them before I fhould be ctifcover'd, which
I had feen by my Glafs it was eafy to do.
While I was making this March, my former
Thoughts returning, I began to abate my Refolu-
tion ; I do not mean, that I entertain'd Bny Fear
of their Number $ for as they were naked, unarm'd
Wretches, 'tis certain I was fuperior to them; nay,
though I had been alone ^ but it occnrr'd to my
Thoughts, What Call? What Occafion? much
lefs, What Necelfity I was in to go and dip my
Hands in Blood, to attack People, who had neither
done, or intended me any Wrong? Who, as tome,
were innocent, and whofe barbarous Cuftoms were
their own Difafter, being in them a Token indeed
of God's having left them, with the other Nations
of that Part of the World, to fuch Stupidity and
to fuch inhumane Courfes^ but did not call me to
take upon me to be a Judge of their Actions, much
lefs an Executioner of his Juftice ; that whenever
he thought fit, he would take the Caufe into his
own Hands, and by National .Vengeance puniih
them as a People for National Crimes ; but that,
in the meantime, it was none of myBufinefs; that
it was true, Friday might juftify it, becaufe he was
a declar'd Enemy, and in a State of War with thofe
very particular People; and it was lawful for him
to attack them; but I could not fay the fame with
refpect to me. Thefe Things were fo warmly
prefs'd upon my Thoughts, all the Way as I went,
that I refolv'd I would only go and place inyfelf
near them, that I might obferve their barbarous
Feaft, and that I would act then as God fhould
direct; but tlfat unlefs fomething offer'd that was
T 2 more
more a Call to me than Vet I knew of, I would not
•meddle with them.
With this Rclblution 1 enter'd the Wood, and
with all poliible Warynefs and Silence, Ft May fol-
lowing clofe at my Heels, I marcful till 1 came
to the Skirt of the Wood, on the Side which was
next to them ; only that one Corner ot the Wood
lay between me and them ; here I call'd foftly to
Friday, and Iriewing him a great Tree, which was
juft at the Corner of the Wood, I bad him go to
the Tree, and bring me Word if he could fee there
plainly what they were doing : he did fo, and came
immediately back to me, and told me they might
lie plainly view'd there; that they were all about
their Fire, eating the Flelh of one of their Prifo-
hers; and that another lay bound upon the Sand,
a little from them, which'hc laid they would kill
next, and which fir'd all the very Soul within me.,
he told me it was not one of their Nation, but one
of the bearded Men, who he had told me of, that
came to their Country in the Boat: I was fill'd
with Horror at the veiy naming the white-bearded
Man, and going to the Tree, I law p1ainty,by my
Glafs, a white Man who lay upon the Beach of
the Sea, with his Hands and his Feet ty'd with
Flags, or Things likeRnnVs j and that he was an
European, and had.Cloaths on.
There was another Tree, and a little Thidcet
beyond it 'about fifty Tare's nearer to them than
the Place where I was, which by goin^ a little way
about. I faw J mi^ht cotne at undifcover'd, and
that then Ifhonld be within half Shot of them; fo
I .with.held my PfflTmn, though I was indeed en-
rag'd to the higheft Degree, and going back about
twenty Paces, I got behind. frme Bufhes, which held
all .the way, till" I came to the other Tree; and then
1 came to a littk ri/ing Ground, which gave me a
full
C»7?3
full View of them, at tlie Diftance of about eigh-
ty Yards.
' I had now not a Moment to lofe ; for nineteen
of the dreadful Wretches fate upon the Ground, all
dole huddled together, and had jult fent the other
two to butcher the poor Cbriftia*, and bring him,
perhaps, Limb by Limb, to their Fire, and they
were ftoop'd down to untie the Bands at his Feet:
J turn'd to Friday, now Friday, faid I, do as I bid
thte ; Fiiday faid he would ; then, Friday, fays I,
do exactly as you fee me do, fail in nothing : So I
iet down one of the MuLkets, and the Fowling-
Piece, upon the (jround, and Ftidaydid. the like
by his ^ and with the other Muiket I took my
Aim at the Savages, bidding him do the like; then
afking him if he was ready, he faid, yes, then
fire at them, faid 1} and the fame Moment I fir'd
zilfo.
Friday took .his Aim fo much better than I, that
on the Side that he mot, he kilFd two of them,
and wounded three more; and on my Side, I kill'd
one and wounded two. They were, you may be
{lire, in a dreadful Confteination ; and all of them,
who were not hurt, jump'd up upon their Feet,
but did not immediately know which- Way to run,
or which Way to look ; for they knew not from
whence their Deflrudtion came; Friday kept his
Eyes clofe upon me, that as I had bid him, he
might obferve what I did \ fo, as foon as the firft
Shot was made, I threw dou-n the Piece, arid took
up the Foiling.Piece, and Ftiday did the like; he
fee me cock, and prefent, he did the fame again -j
Are you ready, Friday ? laid I ; Yes, fays he ; let
fly then, fays I, in the Name of God, and with
that I fir'd again among the amaz'd Wretches, and
fo did Friday., and as our Pieces were now loaden
with what I call'd Swan Shot, or fmall Piftol Bui-
T ? lets
[ *7« 1
lets, we found only two drop; but fo many were
wounded, that they ran about yelling and ikream-
ing like mad Creatures, all bloody, and miferably
wounded moft of them ; whereof three more fell
quickly after, though not quite dead.
Now, Friday, fays I, (laying down the difcharg'd
Pieces, and taking up the Muiket, which was yet
loaden) follow me, fays I, which he did, with a
great deal of Courage $ upon which I rulh'd out of
the Wood, and ftiew'd myfelf, and Friday clofe at
my Foot j-as foon as I perceiv'd they faw me, I
fhouted as loud as I could, and bad Friday do fo
too} and running as fail as I could, which, by the
$Tay, was not very faft, being loaden with Arms as
". .I Ivas, I made diredtly towards the poor Viflim,
who was, as I faid, lying upon the Beach, or Shore, "
between the Place where they fate and the Sea;
the two Butchers, who were juft going to work
with him, had left him, at the Surprize of ourfirft
Fire, and fled in a terrible Fright to the Sea.fide,
and hadjump'd into a Canoe, and three more of the
reft made the fame Way: I turn'd to Friday, and bid
him ftep forwards, and fire at them; he under-
ftood me immediately, and running about forty
Yards to be near them, he fhot at them, and I
thought he had HUM them all, for I fee them all
fall of a Heap into the Boat ; though I faw two of
them up again quickly : However, he kill'd two
of them, and wounded the third ; fo that he lay
down in the Bottom of the Boat, as if he had been
dead.
AV.hile my Man Friday fir'd at them, I pull'd out
mv Knife, and cut the Flags that bound the poor
Vidim, and loofing his Hands and Feet, I lifted
him up, and afk'd him, in the Pmtvgueje Tongue,
What he was ? He anfw.er'd in Latin < CJiriftiam ;
but was fo weak and faint, that he could fcarce
{land,
iland or fpeak; I took my Bottle out of my Poc-
ket, and gave it him, making Signs that he Ihould
drink, which he did; and I gave him a Piece of
Bread, which he eat; Then I atk'd him, What
Countryman he was ? And he faid, Efpagniole ^ and
being a little recover'd, let me know by all the
Signs he could poflibly make, how much he was
in my Debt tor his Deliverance: Seignior, faid 1^
with as much Spanijb as I could make up, we will
•talk afterwards, but we muft fight now j if you
have any Strength left, take this Piftol and Sword,
and lay about you. He took them very thankfully,
.and no fooner had he the Arms in his Hands, but
as if they had put new Vigour into him, he flew
upon his Murderers like a Fury, and had cut two
of them in Pieces in an Inftant; for the Truth is,
as the Whole was a Surprize to them, fo the poor
Creatures were fo much frighted with the Noife of
our Pieces, that they fell down for mere Amaze-
ment and Fear, and had no more Power to at- •
tempt their own Ffcape, than their Flefti had to».
refift our Shot; and that was the Cafe of thofe five
that Friday fhot at in the Boat; for as three of
them fell with the Hurt they receiv'd, fo the other
two fell with the Fright.
I kept my Piece in my Hand ftill, without firing,
being willing to keep my Charge ready, .becaufe I
had given the Spaniard my Piftol and Swords ; fo I
call'd to Friday, and bad him run up to the Tree
from whence we firfl fir'd, and fetch the Arms
which lay there, that had been difcharg'd, which
he did with great Swiftnefs ; and then giving him
my Mulket, I fat down myfelf to load all the reft
again, and bad them coirfe to me when they want-
ed. While I was loading thefe Pieces, there hap-
pen'd a fierce Engagement between the Spaniard
and onq of the Savages,who made at him with one of
T 4 their
their great wooden Swords, the fame Weapon that
was to have kill'd him before, if I had not prevent-
ed it: The Spaniard,' who was as bold and as brave
as coul3 be imagin'd, though weak, had fought
this Indian a good while, and had cut him two
great Wounds on his Head; but the Savage being
a ftout hilly Fellow, clofing in with him, haa
thrown him down, being faint, and was wringing
my Sword out of his Hand, when the Spaniard, tho'
undcrmoflr, wifely quitting the Sword, drew the
• Piftol from his Girdle, fhot the S.ivage through
the Body, and kill'd him upon the Spot, before 1,
who was running to help him, could come near
him.
Friday being now left to his Liberty, purfu'dthe
flying Wretches with no Weapon in his Hand but
his Hatchet; and with that he difpatchi'd thofe
three, who, as I faid before, were wounded at firft,
and fallen, and all the reft he could come up with;
.and the Spaniard coming to me for a Gun, I gave
him one of the Fowling-Pieces, with which he
purfu'd two of the Savages, and wounded them
both ; but as he was not able to run, they both goi
from him into the Wood, where Fiiday purfu'd.
them, and kill'd one of them ; but the other was
too nimble for him; and tho' he was wounded, yet
had plung'd himfelf into the Sea, and fwam with
all his Might off to thofe two who were left in the
Canoe, which three in the Canoe, with one wound-
ed who we know not whether he dy'd or no, were
all that efcap'd our Hands of one and twenty : The
Account of the reft is as follows :
•2, Kill'd at our faft Shot from the Tree.
2 Kill'd at the next Shot.
2 KilUd by Fiiday in the Boat.
2 Kill'd by Ditto, of thofe at firft wounded.

not dead.
:' '. 9 .. •
21 In all.
Thofe that were in the Canoe, work'd hard to
get out of Gun-Shot; and though Friday made two
or three Shot at them, I did not find that he hit
any of them. P> iday would fain have had me took
one of their Canoes, and purfu'd them; and indeed
I was very anxious about their Efcape, leaft carry-
ing the News Home to their People, they fhould
come back, perhaps, with two or three hundred of
their Canoes, and devour us by mere Multitude; fo
I confented to purfue them by Sea, and running to
oiie of their Canoes, I jump'd in, and bad Fi iday
. follow me ; but when I was in the Canoe, I was
I furpriz'd to find another poor Creature lie there a-
live, bound Hand and Foot, as the Spaniard was,
for the Slaughter, and almoft dead with Fear, no4»
knowing what the Matter was; for he had not been
; able to look up over the Side of the Boat, he was
ty'd fb hard, Neclc and Heels, and had been ty'd fo
I long, that he had really but little Life in him.
I immediately cut the twifted Flags, or Rumrs,
which they had bound him with, and would have
helped him up; but he could not (land, or fpeak,
but groan'd moft p"iteoufly, believing (it feems) ftill
that he was only unbound in order to be kill'd.
When Friday came to him, I bad him fpeak to
hjm, and tell him of his Deliverance, and pulling
out my Bottle,'made him give the poor Wretch a
! '',' •' Dram,
[,8*3
Dram, which, with the News of his being deli-
ver'd, reviv'd him, and he fate up in the Boat; but
when Friday came to hear him fpeak, and look
in his Face, it would have mov'd any one to Tears,
*to have feen how Friday kifs'd him, embrac d him,
hugg'd him, cry'd, laugh'd, hollow'd, jump'd a.
bout, danc'd, fung, then cry'd again, wrung his
Hands, beat his own Face and Head, and then
Jung, and jump'd about again, like a diftracted
Creature : It was a good while before I could make
him fpeak to me, or tell me what was the Matter;
but when, he came a little to himfelf, he told me,
that it was his Father.
It is not eafy for me to eiprefs how it mov'd
me to fee what Ecftafy and filial Affedion had
work'd in this poor Savage, at the Sight of his Fa-
ther, and of his being deliver'd from Death ; ncr
indeed can I defcribe half the Extravagancies of his
Affection after this ; for he went into the Boat and
out of the Boat a great many Times : When he
went in to him, he would fit down by him, open
his Breaft, and hold his Father's Head clofe to his
Bofom half an Hour together, to nourilh it; then
he took his Arms and Ankles, which were numb'd
and ftifF with the Binding, and chafed and rubbed
Them with his Hands ; and I perceiving what the
Cafe was, gave him fome Rum out of my Bottle
to rub them with, which did them a great deal of
Good.
This Adion put an End to our Purfuit of the
Canoe, with the other Savages, who were now
gotten almoft out of Sight ; and it was happy f°r
us that we did not; for it blew fo hard within two
Hours after, and before they could be gotten a
Quarter of their Way, and continued blowing 1°
hard all Night, and that from the North.Welt,
which was againft them, that I could not fupp°\e,
their
their Boat could live, or that they ever reach'd to
their own Coaft.
But to return to Friday, he was To bufy about
his Father, that I could not find in my Heart to
take him off for fome Time: But after I thought
he could leave him a little, I call'd him to me,
and he came jumping and laughing, and pleas'd to
the higheft txtream ; then I aik'd him, If he had
given his Father any Bread ? He fhook his Head,
and laid, None : Ugly Dog eat all up felf; fo I gave
him a Cake of Bread out of a little Pouch I carry"d
on Purpofe :, I alfo gave him a Drain for himfelf,
but he would not taile it, but carry'd it to his Fa-
ther : I had in my Pocket alfo two or three Bunch-
es of my Raifins, fo I gave him a Handful of them
for his Father. He had no (boner given his Fa-
ther thefe Raifins, but I faw him come out of the
Boat, and run away as if he had been bewitch'd,
he ran at fiich a Rate; for he was the fwifteft Fel-
low of his Foot that ever I faw ; I fay, he run at
fuch a Rate, that he was out of Sight, as it were,
in an Inftant ; and though I call'd, and hollow'd
too, after him, it was all one, away he went, and
in a Quarter of an Hour, I faw him come back a-
gain, though not fo faft as he went; and as he
came nearer, I found his Pace was flacker, becaufe
he had fomething in his Hand.
When he came up to me, I found he had been
quite Home for an earthen Jugg or Pot to bring
his Father fome frefh Water, and that he had got
two more Cakes, or Loaves of Bread : The Bread
he gave me, but the Water he carry'd to his Father:
However, as I was very thirfty too, I took a little
Sup of it. This Wat?r reviv'd his Father more
than all the Rum or Spirits I had given him 5 for
he was juft fainting with Thirft.
. i
When
When his Father had drank, I call'd to him to
know if there was any Water left ; he faid, yes;
and I bad him give it to the poor Spaniard,
who was in as much Want of it as his Father;
and I fent one of the Cakes, that -Friday brought,
to the Spaniard too, who was, indeed, very weak,
and was repofing himfelf upon a green Place, under
the Shade of a Tree, and whofe Limbs werealfo
very ftiff, and veiy much fwell'd \vith the rude
Bandage he had been ty'd with. When I faw that,
upon Friday's coining to him with the Water, he
late up and drank, and took the Bread, and began
to eat, I went to him, and gave him a Handful of
Raiflns ; he look'd up in my Face with all the To-
kens of Gratitude and Thankfulnefs that could ap-
pear in any Countenance ; but was fo weak, not-
withftanding he had fo exerted himfelf in the Fight,
that he could not fraud upon his Ft^t; he try'd to
do it two or three Times, but was really not able,
his Ankles were fo fwelFd and fo painful to him;
fo I bad him fit ftill, and caufed Friday to rub his
Ankles, arid bathe them with Rum, as he had dene
his Father's.
I obferv'd the poor affectionate Creature_every
two Minutes, or perhaps lefs, all the while he
was here, turn'd his Head about, to fee if his Fa-
ther was in the fame Place and Pofture as he Itft
hjm fitting ; and at left he found he was not to.
be feenj at which he ftarted up, and, without
fpeaking a Word, flew with that Swiftnefs to him,
that one could fcarce perceive his Feet to touch
the Ground as he went: But when he came, he
only found he had laid himfelf down to cafe his
Limbs ; fo Friday came back to.me prcfently, and
I then fpoke to the Spaniard to let Friday help
him up if he could, and lead him to the Boat, and
then he mould carry Jrim to our Dwelling, where
I would
1 would take Care of him: But Friday, a lufty
ftrong Fellow, took the Spaniard quite up upon
his Back, and carry'd him away to the Boat, and
fet him down foftly upon the Side or Gunnel of
the Canoe, with his Feet in the Infide of it, and then
lifted him quite in, and fet him clofe to his Fa-
ther, and prefently ftepping out again, launch'd
the Boat oft] and paddled it along the Shore falter
than I could walk, though the \Vind blew pretty
hard too; fo he brought them both fafe into our
Creek, and leaving them in the Boat, runs away
to fetch the other Canoe. As he pafs'd me, I
fpoke to him, and afk'd him, whether he went,
he told me, Go fetcb more Boat -., fo away he went
like the Wind; for fare never Man or Horfe run
like him, and he had the other Canoe in the Creek
almoft as fcon as I got to it by Land ; fo he wafted
me over, and then went to help our new Guefts
but of the Boat, which he did; but they were nei-
ther of them able to walk; fo that poor Friday
knew not what to do. ,
To remedy this 1 went to work in my Thought,
and calling to Friday to bid them fit down on the
Bank while he came to me, I foon made a Kind
of Hand-Barrow to lay them on, and Friday and I
carry'd them up both together upon it between us :
But when we had got them totheOutfideofourWall
or Fortification, we were at a worfe Lofs than be-
fore ; for it was impolfible to get them over, and'
I was refolv'd not to break it down: So I fet to
Work again , and Friday and I, in about two Hours
Time, made a very handfom Tent, cover'd with
old Sails, and above that with Boughs of Trees,
being in the Space without our outward Fence,
and between that and the Grove of young Wood
which I had planted: And here we made them two
Beds of fuch Things as I had (viz.) of good Rice*
Straw,
Straw, with Blankttfs laid upon it, to lie on, and
another to cover them on each Bed.
My Ifland was now peopled, and I thought ray
felt very rich in Subjects ; and it was a merry Re-
flection which I frequently made, How like a King
I look'd. Firft of all, the whole Country was my
own mere Property ; fo that I had an undoubted
Right of Dominion. Secondly, My People were
perfectly fubjedled : I was abfolute Lord and Law-
giver ; they all ow'd their Lives to me, and were
ready to lay down their Lives (if there had been
Occafion of it) for me. It was remarkable tco, we
had but three Subjects, and they were of three

berty of Conference throughout my Dominions:
But this is by the Way.
As foon as I had fecund my two weak refcueil
Prifoners, and given them Shelter, and a Place to
•eft them upon, I began to think of making feme
'rovifion for them : And the firft Thing I did, I
>rder'd Friday to take a yearling Goat, betwixt a
(id and a Goat, out of my particular Flock, to
>e kill'd, when I cut oft the hinder Quarter, and
hopping it into fmall Pieces, I fet Friday to work
o boiling and ftewing, and made them a very
;ood Difh, I allure you, of Flefh and Broth, ha-
•ing put fome Barley and Rice alfo into the
>roth ; and as I cook'd it without Doors, (for I
lade no Fire within my inner Wall) fo I carry a
: all into the new Tent; and having fet a Table
lere for them, I fate down and eat my owrn Din-
er alfo with them, and, as well as I could, cheard
lem and encourag'd them ; Friday being my foj*
reter, efpecially to his Father, and indeed to the
to ,
Efc
gre
Sa\
Vto
SI
Spaniard too :, for the Spaniard fpoke the Language
of the Savages pretty well.
After we had dined, or rather Tupped, I order'd
Friday to take one of the Canoes,, and go and
fetch our Mufkets and other Fire- Arms, which for
Want of Time we had left upon the Place of Battle ;
and the next Day I order'd him to go and bury
the dead Bodies of the Savages, which lay open to
the Sun, and would prefently be offenfive ; .and I
alfo order'd him to bury the horrid Remains of
their ba barons Feaft, which I knew were pretty
much, and which I could not think of doing" my
felf ; nay, I could not bear to fee them, if I went
that Way : All which he punctually perform'd, and
defac'd the very Appearance of the Savages being
there ; fo that when I went again, I could fcarce
know where it was, otherwife than by the Corner
of the Wood pointing to the Place.
I then began to enter into a little Converfation
with my two new Subjects; and firft I fet Friday
to enquire of his Father, what he thought of the
Efcape of the Savages in that Canoe, and whether we
might expect a Return of them with a Power too
great for us to refift . His firft Opinion was,that the
Savages in the Boat never could live out the Storm
which blew that Night they went off, but muft of
Necelfity be drown'd or driven South to thofe other
Shores, where they were as fure to be devour'd as
they were to be drown'd if they were caft away ^
but as to what they would do if they came fafe on
Shore, he faid he knew not.; but it was his Opini-
on that they were fo dreadfully frighted with the
Manner of their being attack'd, theNoife and the
Fire, that he believ'd they would tell their People
they were all kill'd by Thunder and Lightning, not
by the Hand of Man, and that the two which
appear'd, (viz.) Friday and me, were two Heavenly
• Spirits
Spirits or Furies, come down to deftroy them and
not Men with Weapons: This he laid he knew,
becaufe he heard them all cry out fo in their Lan.
guage to one another ; for it was impollible to them
to conceive that a Man could dart Fire, and fpeak
Thunder, and kill at ?. Diftance without lifting up
the Hand, as was done now: And this old Savage
was in the right ; for, as I uhderftood fince by
others Hands, the Savages never attempted to go fr
ver to the Ifland afterwards j they were fo terrifrd
with the Accounts given by thofe four Men, ; for it
feems they did efcape the Sea> that they believ'd
whoever went to that enchanted Ifland would te
deftroy'd with Fire from the Gods. )1,
This however I knew not, and therefore was un.
dei continual Apprehenfions for a good while, ad
kept always upon my Guard, me and all my Arfnfs
for as we were now four of us, I would have ven.
tur'd upon a hundred of them fairly in the open
Field at any Time.
In a little Time, however, no more Canoes ap;
pearing, the Fear of their Coming wore off, and
I began to take my former Thoughts of a Voyage
to the Main into Confutation, being likewife af.
lur'd by Fridays Father, that I might depend upoil
jood Ufage from their Nation on his Account, «
[ would go.
But my Thoughts were a little fufpended, when
[ had aferious Difcourfe with the Spaniard, and
vhen I underftood that there were lixteeh fflore
)f his Countrymen and Pcrtjiguefe, who having
>een caft away, and made their Efcape to tna.
iide, liv'd there at Peace indeed with the Saya.
res but were very fore put to it for Keceflanes,
nd indeed for Life: I afVd him all the Par
iculars of their Voyage, and found they were
Spanijb Ship .bound from the Riodelall«V
to the Havana, being direfled to leave their Load"
Ing there, which was chiefly Hides and Silver, and
to bring back what European Goods they could
meet with there; that they had five Portuguefe Sea-
men on Board, whom they took out of another
Wreck ; that five of their own Men were drowned
when the firft Ship was loft, and that thefe tfcaped
thro' infinite Dangers and Hazards, and arriv'd afc-
moft ftarv'd on the Cannibal Coaft, where they ex^
peded to have been devour'd every Moment.
He told me, they had fome Arms with them^
but they were perfedly 'ufelefs for that they had
neither Powder or Ball, the Warning of the Sea
having fpoil'd all their Powder, but a little/ which
they ufed at their firft Landing to provide them-
felves fome Food.
I afk'd him what he thought would become of
them there, and if they had form'd no Defign of
making any Efcape ? He faid, They had many
Confultations about it, but that having neither
Veflel, or Tools to build one, or Provifions of any
Kind, their Counfels always ended in Tears and
Defpair'.
I aflk'd him how he thought they would receive
a Propofal from me, which might tend towards an
Efcape : And whether, if they were all here, it might
not be done ? I told him with Freedom, I fear'd
moftly their Treachery and ill Ufage of me, if I
put my Life in their Hands ^ for that Gratitud'e was
no inherent Virtue in the Nature of Man j nor
did Men always fquare their Dealings by the Obli-
gations they had receiv'd, fo much as they did
by the Advantages they expected. I told him, it
would be very hard, that I fhould be the Inftrum'ent
of their Deliverance, and that they mould after-
wards make me their Prifoner in New Spain, where
an Englifiman was certain to be made a Sacri-
V
ficfe, what Necelfity, or what Accident feeder
brought him thither ; And that I had rather be de-
liver'd up to the Savages, and be devour'd alive,
than fall into the mercilefs Claws of thePrietts, and
be carry'd into the Tnqnijitiott. I added, That o-
therwife I was perfwaded, if they were all here,
we might, with fo many Hands, build a Bark large
enough to carry us all away, either to the Braflt
Southward, or to the Iflands or Spanijh Coaft
Northward : But that if in Requital they fhould,
when I had put Weapons into their Hands, carry
me by Force among their own People, I might be
ill ufed for my Kindnefs- to them, and make my
Cafe worfe than it was before.
He anfwer'd with a great deal of Candor and In-
genuity, That their Condition was fo miferable,
and they were fo fenfible of it, that he believed
they would abhor the Thought of ufing any Man
unkindly that mould Contribute to their Delive-
rance ; and that, if Ipleafed, he would go to them
With the old Man, and difcourfe with them about
it, and return again, and bring me their Anfwer:
That he would make Conditions with them upon
their folemn Oath, That they fliould be abfolute-
ly under my Leading, as their Commander and
Captain ; and that they mould Avear upon the Holy
Sacraments and the Gofpel, to be true to me, and
to go to fiKh Chriftian Country as that I ihould
agree to, and no other; and to be directed wholly
and abfoltitely by my Orders, 'till they were land-
ed fafely in.fuch Country as I intended-, and that
he would brim?; a Contract from them under their
Hands for that Purpofe..
Then he told me, he would firft fwear to me
himfelf, That he would never ftiffrom me as long
as he liv'd, 'till I gnve him Orders; and that he
would take my Side to the. laft Drop.of his Blood*
if
2f there mould happen the leaft Breach of Faith a-
'tnon'g his Countrymen.
He told me, they were all of them very civil
honeft Men, and they were under the greateft Di-
ftrefs imaginable, having neither Weapons or
Cloaths, nor any Food, but at the Mercy and Di-
fcretion of the Savages; out of all Hopes of ever
returning to their own Country ; and that he was
fure, if I would undertake their Relief, they
Would live and die by me.
Upon thefe Aflurances, I refolv'd to venture to
relieve them, if poilible, and to fend the old Savage
and this Spaniard over to them to treat : But when
we had gotten all Things in a Readinefs to go, the
Spaniard himfelf ftarted an Objedtiow, which had
fb much Prudence in it on one hand, and fo much
Sincerity on the other hand, that I could not but
be very well fatisfy'd in it ; and, by his Advice, put
off the Deliverance of his Comrades for at leaft half
a Year. The Cafe was thus:
He had been with us now about a Month ; du-
ring which Time, I had let him fee in what Man-
ner I had provided, with the Ailiftance of Provi-
dence, for my Support; and he faw evidently what
Stock of Corn and Rice I had laid up^ which, as
it was more than fufficient for my felf, fo it was
hot fufficient, at leaft without good Hufbandry,
For my Family, now it was encreas'd to Number
Four : But much lefs would it be fufficient, if
his Countrymen, who were, as he faid, fourteen
ftill alive, ftiould come over. And leaft of all
would it be fufficient to vittual our VefTel, if we
ftiould build one, for a-Voyage to^ny of the Chri-
ftian Colonies of Ametica. So he told me, he thought
it would be mcire advifable, to let him and the
two other dig and cultivate fome more Land, as
much as I could fpare Seed to fow -, and that we
U 2 fliould
fV.ould wait another Harveft, that we might have
a Supply of Corn for his Countrymen when they
ihould come; for Want might be a Temptation to
them to difagree, or not to think themfelves deli-
vered, otherwife than cut of one Difficulty into
another. You know, fays he, the Children of//.
rael, though they rejoyc'd at firft for their being
deliver'd out of Egypt, yet rebel I'd even againlt God
himfelf that deliver'd them, when they came to
want Bread in the Wildernefs.
His Caution was fo feafonable, and his Advice
fogood, that I could not but be very well pleafed
with his Propofal, as well as I was fatisfy'd with
his Fidelity. So we fell to digging all four of us,
as well as the wooden Tools we were iurnifh'd
xvith permitted; and in about a Month's Time,by
the End of which it was Seed-time, we had got-
ten as mnch Land cur'd and triinuVd up,as we fow-
ed 22 Bufhels of Barley on, and 16 Jarrs of Rice, ]
which was, in {hort, all the Seed we had tofpare .t J
nor indeed did we leave our felves Barley fufficient ^
for cur own Food, for the fix Months that we had ]
to expect our Crop, that is to fay, reckoning from ]
the Time we fet our Seed afide for fowing; for it j
is not to be fuppofed it is fix Months in the Ground
in the Country.
Having now Society enough, and our Number
bdrig fufficient to put us out of Fear of the Sa-
vages, if they had come, unlefs their Number had
be'en very great, we went freely all over the Ifland,
where-ever we found Oceafion j and as here we had
nnr Efcane or Deliverance upon our Thoughts, it
was impoiiible, at leajl for me, to have the
Means of it out of mine -? to this Purpofe,
I mark'd out feveral Trees which I thought fit for
pur,Work, arid I fet Friday and his Father to cut-
ting them down.; and then I caufed the Spaniard
to whom I imparted my Thought on that Affair,
to overfee and direct their Work. I mew'd them
with what indefatigable Pains I had hewed a large
Tree into fingle Planks, and I caufed them to do
the like, 'till they had made about a Dozen large
Planks of good Oak, near two Foot bread, 3 > Foot
long, and from 2 Inches to 4 Inches thick : \Vhat
prodigious Labour it took up, any one may ima-
gine.
At the fame Time I contriv'd to increafe my lit-
tle Flock of tame Goats as much as I could j and
to this Purpofe, I made Friday and the Spaniard go
out one Day, and myfelf with Friday the nest
Day, for we took our Turns; and by this Means
we got above 20 young Kids to breed up with the
reft; for whenever we fhot the Dam, we faved
the Kids, and added them to our Flock: But above
all, the Seafon for curing the Grapes coming on,.
I caufed fuch a, prodigious Quantity to be hung up
in the Sun, that I believe, had we been at Alicdnt,
where the Raifins of the Sun are cur'd, we could
have fill'd 60 or 80 Barrels ; and thefe, with our
Bread, was a great Part of our Food, and very good
living too, I allure you; for it is an exceeding nou-
rifhing Food.
It was noxv Harveft, and our Crop in good Or-
der ; it was not the moft plentiful Increafe I had,
feen in the Ifland, but, however, it w* enough t?
anfwer our End; for from our 22 Bulhels of Bar-
ley, we brought in and thrafhed out above 220
Bulhels ; and the like in Proportion of. the Rice,
which was Store enough for our Food to the next
Harveft, tho' all the 16 Spaniards had been on ^hore
with me ; or if we had been ready for a Vo}>.age,
it would very plentifully have victualled our Ship,
to have carry'd us to any Part of the World, that
is to fay, of America.
U 3 Whea
\Vhen we had thus hofis'd and fecurM our Ma-
gazine ot Corn, we tell to work to make more
Wicker 'V'ork, viz. great Bafkets in which we kept
it j and rhe Spaniard was very handy and dexterous
at this Part, and often blam'd me that I did not
make fome Things tor Defence, of this Kind of
Work i but I faw no Need of it
And now having a full Supply of Food for all
the Guefts I expected, I gave the Spaniard Leave
to go over to the Main, to fee what he could do
with thofe he had left behind him there. I gave
him a ftridl Charge in Writing, not to bring any
Man with him, who would not firft fvvear in the
Prefence of himfelf and of the old Savage, That
he would no Way injure, fight with, or attark the
Perfon he mould find in the Ifland, who was fo
kind to fend for them in order to their Delive-
rance ; but that they would ftand by and defend
him sgainft all fuch Attempts, and where-ever
they went, would be entirely under and fubjeded
to his Commands ; and that this mould be put in
Writing, and fign'd with their Hands: How we
were to have this done, when I knew they had
neither Pen or Ink, that, indeed, was a Queftion
which we never alk'd.
Under thefe Inftrudtions, the Spaniard, and the
old Savage fthe Father of Friday) went away in one
of the Canoe!, which they might be faid to come
in, or rather were brought in, when they came as
Prifoners to be devour'd by the Savages.
I gave each of them a Mufket with a Firelock
on it, and about. eight Charges of Powder ana
Ball, charging them tp be very good Huftands of
both, and not to ufe either of them but upon ur•
gent Occafion. .
This was a chearful Work, being the firft Mea-
fures ufed by me in View of my Deliverance for
now
now 27 Years and fome Days. I gave them Provi-
fions of Bread, and of dry Grapes, fufficient for
themfelves for many Days, and fufficient for all
their Country-men for about eight Days Time; and
wifhing them a good Voyage, I fee them go, a-
greeing with them about a Signal they Ihould hang
out at their Return, by which I fhoukl know them
again, when they came back, at a Dilhmce, before
Jhey came on Shore.
They went away with a fair Gale on the Day
that.the Moon was at Full; by my Account in the
Month of Offober ; but as for an exatt Reckoning
of Days, after I had once loft it, J could never re-
cover it again ; nor had I kept even the Number of
Years fo punctually, as to be fure that I was right,
tho', as it prov'd, when I afterwards examin'd my Ac-
count, I found I had kept a true Reckoning of Yejrs.
It was no lefs than eight Days I had waited for
them, when a Strange and unforefeen Accident in-
terven'd, of which the like has not, perhaps, been
heard of in Hiftory. I was faft afleep in my Hutch
one Morning, when my Man Friday came running
in to me, and call'd aloud, Mafter, Mafter, they
are come, they are come.
I jump'd up, and, regardlefs of Danger, I went
out as fbon as I could get my Cloaths on, thro'
my little Grove, which (by the Way) was by this
Time grown to be a very thick Wood : I fay, re-
gardlefs of Danger, I went without my Arms,
Which was not my Cuftom to do ; but I was fur-
priz'd, when turning my Eyes to the Sea, I pre-
femly faw a Boat at about a League and Half's Di-
ftance, ftanding in for the Shore, with a Shoulder of
Mutton Sail, as they call it, and the Wind blow-
ing pretty fair to bring them in ; alfo I obferv'd
prefently, that they did not come from that Side
which the Shore lay on, but from the Souther-
U 4 rnoft
moft End of the Ifland : Upon this, I call'd Friday
in, and bid him lie clofe, tor theft were not the
People we look'd for, and that we might not know
yet whether they were Friends or Enemies.
In the next Place, I went in to fetch my Per-
fpedive Glafs, to fee what I could make of them;
and having taken the Ladder out, I climb'dupto
the Top of the Hill, as I ufed to do when I was
apprehenfive of anything, and to take my View
the plainer without being difcover'd.
I had fcarce fet my Foot on the Hill, when ray
Eye plainly difcover'd a Ship lying at an Anchor,
at about two Leagues and a Half's Diftance from
me South.fouth-eaft, but not above a League and
gn Half from the Shore. By my Obfervation it ap-
pear'd plainly to be an Eugli/h Ship, and the Boat
appear'd to be an Englijb Long-Boat.
I cannot exprefs the Confufion I was in, tho' the
Joy of feeing a Ship, and one who I had Reafon to
elieve was mann'd by my own Country.men, and
confequently Friends, was fuch as I cannot defcribe;
but yet I had fome fecret Doubts hung about me,
I cannot tell from whence they came, bidding me
keep upon my Guard. In the firft Place, it oc.
Curr'd to me to confider what Bufinefs an Ev$f>
Ship could have in f hat Part of the World, lince
it was not the Way to or from any Part of the
World where the Evglijl) had any Traffick ; and
I knew there had been no Storms to drive them
in there, as in Diftrefs; and that if they were Eng-
llft) really, it was moft probable that they were
here upon no good DefTgn ; and that I had better
continue as I was, than fall into the Hands of
. . Thieves and Murderers.
Let no Man defpife the fecret Hints and Notices
of Danger which fometimes are given him,
f, \vhen he may think there is no. Poifibility of its
being
being real. That fuch Hints and Notices are given
us, I believe few that have made any Obfervations
of Things can deny ^ that they are certain Dif-
coveries of an invifible World, and a Converfe of
Spirits, we cannot doubt, and if the Tendency
of them feems to be to warn us of Danger, why
ihould we not fuppofe they are from fome friendly
Agent, whether fupreme, or inferior and fubordi-
nate, is not the Queftion; and that they are given
for our Good ?
The prefent Queftion abundantly confirms me in
the Juftice of this Reafoning ^ for had I not been
made cautious by this iecret Admonition, come it
from whence it will, I had been undone inevitably,
and in a far worfe Condition than before, as you
will fee prefently.
I had not kept myfelf long in this Pofture, but
I faw the Boat draw near the Shore, as if they
look'd for a Creek to thruft in at for the Conveni-
ence of Landing: However, as they did not come
quite far enough, they did not fee the little Inlet
where I formerly landed my Rafts, but ran their
Boat on Shore upon the Beach, at about half a
Mile from me, which was very happy for me; for
otherwife, they would have landed juft (as I may
fay) at my Door, and would foon have beaten me
out of my Caftle, and perhaps have plunder'd me
of all I had.
, When they were on Shore, I was fully fetisfy'd
that they were Englishmen, at leaft, moft of them;
one or two I thought were Dittcb ; but it did not
prove fo: There were in all eleven Men, whereof
three of them I found were unarm'd, and, as I
thought, bound ; and when the firft four or five of
them were jump'd on Shore, they took thofe three
out of the Boat as Prifoners : One of the three I
: could perceive ufing the moft paflionate Geftures of
Entreaty,
Jnjreaty, Affliction and Defpair, even to a kind of
Extravagance ; the other two, 1 could perceive,
lifted up their Hands foaoeturies, and appeanlcon.
cern'd indeed, but not to" fuch a Degree as" the
firft.
I was perfectly confounded at the Sight, and
knew not what the Meaning of it mould be. fit
day call'd out to me in Eugli/f), as well as he could,
0 Mafter ! Ton fee Kngliih Mam eat Prifoner as wJ
as Savage Mans. "Why, fa^s I, Friday, do you
think they are a going to eat them then ? 2«,%s
Friday, 1 hey will eat tbetn: No, no, fays I, Frfyi
1 am afraid they will murder them, indeed, but
you may be fure they will not eat them.
All this while I had no Thought of wjiat the
Matter really was \ but' ftood trembling with the
Horror of the Sight, expecting every Moment when
the three Prifoners fhould be kill'd ; nay, oncel faw
one of the Villains lift up his Arm with a great Cut-
lam, (as the Seamen call it) or Sword, to ftrikeone
of the poor Men ; and I expected to fee him fall
every Moment, at which all the Blood in my Body
jfeem d to run chill in my Veins.
I wim'd heartily now for my Spaniard, and the
Savsge that was gone with him ^ or that I h»d»:
ny Way to have come undifcover'd within Snot ol
them, that I might have refcu'd the three Men i
for I faw no Fire- Arms they had among them; but
it fell out to my Mind another Way.
After I had obferv'd theoutragiousUfageof tw
:hree Men by the infolent Seamen, I obfervd the
Fellows run fcattering about the Land, as if they
wanted to fee the Country : I obfervd that the
:hree other Men had Liberty to go alfo where they
)leas?d; but they "fate down all three upon tje
rround very penfive, and look'd like Men •»

the

W]
This put me in Mind of the firft Time when }
came on Shore, and began to look about me 5 how
I gave my felt" over for loft, how wildly I look'd
round me, what dreadful Apprenfions I had, an4
how I lodg'd in the Tree all Night for fear of
being devour'd by-wild Beafts.
As I knew nothing that Night of the Supply I
was to receive by the providential Driviug 'of the
Ship nearer the Land, by the Storms and Tide, by
which I have fince been fo long nouriih'd and fup-
ported; fo thefe three poor defolate Men knew no-
thing how certain of Deliverance, and Supply they
were, how near it was to them, and how effedu-
ally and ready they were in a Condition of Safety,
at the fame Time that they thought themfelves loft,
and their Cafe defperate.
So little do we fee before us in the World, and
fb much Reafon have we to depend chearfully upon
the great Maker of the World, that he does not
leave his Creatures fo abfolutely deftitute, but that
in the worft Circumftances they have always fome-
thing to be thankful for, and fornetimes are nearer
their Deliverance than they imagine; nay, are even
brought to their Deliverance by the Means by
which they feem to be brought to their Deftru-
ction.
It was juft at the Top of High-Water when thefe
People came on Shore, and while partly they ftood
parly ing with the Prisoners they brought, and part-
ly while they rambled about to fee what kind of a
Place they were in, they had carelefly ftaid till the
Tide was fpent, and the Water-wasebb'd confidera-
bly away, leaving their Boat a-ground.
They had left two Men in the Boat, who as I
found afterwards, having drank a little too much
Brandy, fell a-fleep ; however, one of them waking
fooner than the other, and finding the Boat too faft
:«:«,; : . ;: . 3-grOUnd

a-ground for him to ftir it, hollow'd for the reft wljo
were ftraggling about, upon which they all foon
came to the Boat ^ but it was paft all their Strength
to launch her, the Boat being very heavy, and the
Shore on that Side being a foft oufy Sand, almoft
like a Quick-Sand.
In this Condition, like true Seamen, who are per-
haps the leaft «f all Mankind given to Fore thought,
they gave it over, and away they ftroll'd about the
Country again ; and I heard one of them fay aloud
to another, calling them off from the Boat, Vb),lit
tier alone, Jack, can't ye, fie will float next Tide; by
which I was fully confirm'd in the main Enquiry,
of what Countrymen they were.
All this while I kept my felf very clofe, not once
daring to ftir out of my Caftle, any farther than to
my Place of Obfervation near the Top of the Hill;,
and very glad I was, to think how well it wasforti.
{yd : I knew it was no lefs than ten Hours before
the Boat could be on float again, and by that Time
it would be dark, and I might be at more Liberty ^
to fee their Motions, and to hear their Difcourfe, if'
they had any. 3
In the mean time, I fitted my felf up for a Bat. whe
tel as before, though with more Caution, knowing reft]
I had to do with another kind of Enemy than I had pav
Sit firft. I order'd Friday alfo, who I had made an to %'
excellent Markfman with his Gun, to load him. All
felf with Arms : I took my felf two Fowling-Pieces, yQu
and I gave him three Mufkets; my Figure indeed foi
was very fierce; I had my formidable Goat.Skin 1 fs
Coat on, with the great Cap I have mention d, a to
naked Sword by my Side, two Piftols in my Belt,
and a Gun upon each Shoulder.
It was my Defign, as I faid above, not to have
made any Attempt till it was dark : But about
Two a Clock, being the Heat of the. Day, I found ietl

that in fhort they were all gone {haggling into the
Woods, and, as I thought, were laid down to Sleep.
The three poor diftrefled Men, too anxious for their
Condition to get any Sleep', were, however, fet
down under the Shelter of a great Tree, at about
a quarter of a Mile from me, and, as I thought, out
of Sight of any of the reft.
Upon this I refolv'd to difcover my felf to them,
and learn fomething of their Condition : Immedi-
ately I march'd in the Figure as above, my Man
Fi iday at a good Diftance behind me, as formidable
for his Arms as I, but not maki£ quite fo flaring
a Spettre-like Figure as I did. *^
I came as near them undifcover'd as I could,
and then before any of them faw me, I call'd aloud
to them in Spani/i, What are ye Gentlemen ?
They ftarted up at the Noife, but were ten
times more confounded when they faw me, and
the uncouth Figure that I made. They made no
Anfwer at all; but I thought I perceiv'd them juft
going to fly from me, when I fpoke to them in
Eitglijh : Gentlemen, faid I, do not be furpriz'd at
me ; perhaps you may have a Friend near you
when you did not expect it. He muft be fent di-
rectly from Heaven then, faid ove of them very
gravely to me, and pulling (f bis Hat at the fame Time
to me, for our Condition is paft the help of Man.
All Help is from Heaven, Sir, faid I. But can
you put a Stranger in the Way how to Help you,
for you feem to me to be in fome great Diftrefs ?
I faw you when you landed, and when youfeem'd
to make Application to the Brutes that came with
you, I faw one of them lift up his Sword to kill
you.
The poor Man, with Tears running down his
Face, and trembling, looking like one aftonim'd,
return'd, Am I talking to God, or Man! h It a teal
Man
Man, or an Augel! Be in no fear about that, Sir,
faid I, if God had fent an Angel to relieve you, he
would have come better cloath'd, and arm'd after
another Manner than you fee me in ^ pray layalide
your Fears, I am a Man, an ErgliJInnan, and dif.
pos'd to aflift you, you fee; I have one Servant
only; we have Arms and Ammunition ; tell us
freely, Can we ferve you ? What is your
Cafe ;
Our Cafe, faid he, Sir, is too long to tell you,
while our Murderers are fo near j but, in ihorf,
Sir, I was Corri^nder of that Ship, my Men
have mutiny'd agwift me $ they have been hard-
ly prevail'd on not to murder me, and at laft
have fet me on Shore in this defolate Place, with
thefe two Men with me, one my Mate, theothel
a PafTenger, where we expected to perifh, believ-
ing the Place to be uninhabited, and know not yet
what to think of it.
Where are thofe Brutes, your Enemies, faid'.
do you know where they are gone ? There tkyty,
Sir, faid he, pointing to a Thicket of Trees, *J
Heart trembles for fear they have feen us, aid few
itott fpeak 5 if they have, bey will certainly murler si
all. . >.
Have they any Fire.Arms, faid I? He anfwerd,
they had only two Pieces, and one which thev
left in the Boat. Well then, faid I,»leave the reft
to me ; I fee they are all afleep, it is an ealy
thing to kill them all; but mall we rather take
them Priloners? He told me, there were two de.
fpdrate Villains among them that it was fcar«
fafe to fhew any Mercy to 5 but if they were ie.
cur'd, he believ'd all the reft would return to
their Duty. I aiFd him, which they were ? W
told me, he could not at that Diftance defer*
them j but he would obey my Orders in any thin?

I would direcT: Well, fays I, let us retreat out of
their View or Hearing, leaft they awake, and we
will refolve farther ; fo they willingly went back
with me, till the Woods cover'd us from them.
Look you, Sir, feid I, if I venture upon your
Deliverance, are you willing to make two Condi-
tions with me j he anticipated my Propofals, by
telling me, that both he and the Ship, if recover'd,
fhould be wholly directed and commanded by me
in every thing ; and if the Ship was not recover'd,
he would live and die with me in what Part of the
World foever I would lend him; and the two other
Men faid the fame.
7lrell, fays I, my Condition are but two. i. That
while you flay on this Ifland with me, you will not
pretend to any Authority here; and if I put Arms
into your Hands, you will upon all Occafions give
them up to me, and do no Prejudice to me or mine,
upon this Ifland, and in the mean time be govern'd
by my Orders.
2. That if the Ship is, or may be tecover'd,
you will carry me and my Man to Evgland Paf-
fage-free.
He gave me all the Aflurances that the Invention
and Faith of Man could devife, that he would com-
ply with thefe mod reafonable Demands, and be-
fides would owe his Life to me, and acknowledge
it upon all Occafions as long as he liv'd.
Well then, faid J, he-re are three Mufkets for
you, with Powder and Ball; tell me next what you
think is proper to be done. He ftiewed all the
Teftimony of his Gratitude that he was able ;
but offer'd to be wholly guided by me. I told him,
I thought it was hard venturing any Thing j But
the beft Method I could think of was to fire upon
them at once, as they lay ; and if any was not
kiird at the firft Volley, and offered to fubmit.
t 3°4
we might fave them, and fo put it wholly upon
God s Providence to dirett the Shot.
He faid very modeftly, That he was loath to
kill them, if he could help it }. but that thofetwo
were incorrigible Villains, and had been the Au-
thors of all the Mutiny in the Ship, and if they
efcaped, we fhould be undone ftill; for they would
go on Board, and bring the whole Ship's Com-
pany, and deftroy us all. Well then, fays I, &•
ce/tty legitimates my Advice ; for it is the ml)
Jfay to fave our Lives. However, feeing him ftill
cautious of (bedding Blood, I told him they fhould
gc themfelves, and manage as they found con-
venient.
In the Middle of this Difcourfe, we heard fome
of them awake, and foon after we faw two of
them on their Feet. I afk'd him, if either of them
were the Men who he had faid were the Heads
of the Mutiny? He faid, No: Well then, faid I,
you may tlet them efcape, and Providence feems to
have waken'd them on Purpofe to fave themfelves.
Now, fays I, if the reft efcape you, it is your
Fault.
Animated with this, he took the Mufket I
had given him in his Hand, and a Piftol ia
bis Belt, and his two Comrades with him, with
;ach Man a Piece in his Hand. The two Men
,vho were with him going firft, made feme
Sfoife, at which one of the Seamen, who was
twake, turn'd about, and feeing them coming,
ry'd out to the reft; but it was too late then; fo*
he Moment he cry'd out, they fir'd ; I mean the too
Wen, the Captain wifely referving his own Piece:
?hey had fo well aim'd their Shot at the Men they
new, that one of them was kill'don the Spot, and
be other very much wounded; but not being dead,
e ftarted up upon his Feet, and call'd eagerly for
help,
help to the other} but the Captain flapping tohim^
told him, 'twas too late to cry for help, hefhould
call upon God to forgive his villany,and with that
Word knock'd him down with the Stock of his
Musket, fo that he never fpoke more: There were
three more in the Company, and one of them was
alfo (lightly wounded : By this Time I was come,
and when they faw their Danger, and that it was
in vain to refift, they begg'd for Mercy: The Cap-
tain told them he would fpare their Lives, if they
would give him any Aflurance of their Abhorrence
of the Treachery they had been guilty of, and would
fwear to be faithful to him in recovering the Ship,
and afterwards in carrying her back to Jamaica,
from whence they came: They gave him all the
Proteftations of their Sincerity that could be deur'd,
and he5 was willing to believe them, and fpare their
Lives, which I was not againft } only I oblig'd him
to keep them bound Hand and Foot while they were
upon the liland. ,
While this was doing, I. fent Friday with the
Captain's Mate to the Boat, with Orders to fecure
her, and bring away the Oars, and Sail, which
they did; and by and by, three ttraggling Men that
were (happily for them) parted from the reft, came
back upon heaving the Guns fir.'fc, and feeing their
Captain, who before was their Prifoner, now their
Conqueror, they fubmitted to be bound alfo; and
fo our Victory was compleat.
It now remain'd, that the Captain and I fhould
enquire into one another's Circumftances: I began
firll, and told him my whole Hiftory, which he
heard with an Attention even to Amazement; and
particularly, at the wonderful Manner of my being
furnifh'd with Provilions and Ammunition; and
indeed, as my Story is a whole Collection of Won-
ders, it affected him deeply -, but when he reflected
-' X from
rom thence upon himfelf, and how I feem'd to
iave been, prtferv'd there, on purpofe to fave his
Jfe, the Tears ran down his Face, and he could
iot {peak a Word more.
After this Communication was at an End, I carty'd
lim and his two Men into my Apartment, lead-
n<* them in, jutr. where I came out, viz. at the
Pop of the Houfe, where I refrefh'd them with
iich Provifiohs as I had, and fliew'd them all the
Contrivances I h.id made, during my long, long,
inhabiting that Place.
All I fhew'd them, all I faid to them, was per-
I'ctly amazing} but above all, the Captain admir'd
ny Fortification, and how perfectly I had conceal'd
my Retreat with a Grove of Trees, which having
l)een now planted near twenty Years, and the Trees
growing much fatter than in England, was become
a little Wood, and fo thick, that it was unpaflable
in any Part of it, but at that one Sid?, where I
had 'referv'd my little winding Pafliige into it: I
told him, this was my Caltle, and my Refidence;
but that I had a Seat in the Country, as molt Prin-
ces have, whither I could retreat upon Occafion,
and I would fhew him that too another Time;
but at prefent, c»r Bufmtfs was to confider how
to recover the Ship: He agreed with meas to thaf,
but told rne, he was perfectly at a Lofs what Mea-
iiires to take; for that there were ftill fix and twenty
Hands on board, who having em red into a curled
Confpiracy, by which they had all forfeited their
Lives to the Law, would be harden'd in it now by
Delperationj and would carry it on, knowing that
if they were reduc'd, they fhould be brought to the
Gallows, as foon as they came to England, or to
any of the Englijh Colonies } and that therefore
there would be no attacking them .with fo lmalla
Number as we were. * *• • ,j
I mus'd for Come Time upon what he had faid,
and found it was a very rational Conclusion; and
that therefore fomething was to be refolv'd on ve-
ry fpeedily, as well to draw the Men on board in-
to fome Snare for their Surprize, as to prevent their
Landing upon us, and destroying usj upon this it
prefently occurr'd to me, that in a little while the
Ship's Crew wondring what was become of their
Comrades, and of the Boar, would certainly come
on Shore in their other Boat, to fee for them, and
that then perhaps they might come arm'd, and be
too ftrong for us; this he allow'd was rational.
Upon this, I told him the firft Thing we had to
do, was to Have the Boat, which lay upon the
Beach, fo that they might not carry her off} and
taking every Thing out of her, leave her fo far ufelefs
as not to b,e fit to fwim; accordingly we went on
board, took the Arms which were left on board,
out of her, and whatever elfe we found there,
which was a Bottle of Brandy, and another of
Rum, a few Bisket Cakes, a Horn of Powder, and
a great Lump of Sugar, in a Piece of Canvas } the
Sugar was five or fix Pounds } all which was ve-
ry welcome to me, efpecially the Brandy and
Sugar, of which I had had none left for many
Years.
When we had carry'd all thefe Things on Shore
(the Oars, Malt, Sail, and Rudder of the Boat,
were carry'd away before, as above) we knock'd a
great Hole in her Bottom, that if they had come
ftrong enough to mafter us, yet they could not car-
ry off the Boat.
Indeed, it was not much in my Thoughts, that
we could be able to recover the Ship; but my View
was that if they went away without the Boat, I did
not much quettion to make her fit again, to carry us
away to the Leeward Iflands, and call upon our
X z Friends
Friends, the Spaniards^ in my way, for I had them
Hill in my Thoughts.
While we were thus preparing our Defigns, and
had firft, by main Strength, heav'd the Boat up up-
on the Beach, fo high that the Tide would not
fleet her off at High-Water-JVIavk; and befides,
had broke a hole in her Bottom, too big to be
quickly ftopp'd, and were fat down mufing what
we fhould doj we heard the Ship fire a Gun, and
faw her make a Waft with her Antient, as a Signal
for the Boat to come on Board } but no Boat ftirr'd;
and they fir'd feveral times, making other Signals
for the Boat.
• At laft, when all their Signals and Firings prov'd
fruitlels, and they found the Boat did not ftir, we
faw them by the help of my Glaffcs, hoift another
Boat out, and row towards the Shore 3 and we
found as they approach'd, that there was no lefs
than ten Men in her, and that they had Fire-Arms
with them.
As the Ship lay almoft two Leagues from the
Shore, we had a full view of them as they came,
and a plain fight of the Men, even of their Faces,
bccaufe the Tide having fct them a little to theEajl
of the other Boat, they row'd up under Shore, to
come to the fame Place, where the other had land-
ed, and where the Boat lay.
By this means, I fay, we had a full view of them,
and the Captain knew the Perfons and Characters
of all the Men in the Boat, of whom he faid, that
there were three very honeft Fellows, who he\vas
fure were led into thisConfpiracy by thereil, being
over-power'd and high ted.
But that as for the Boatfwain, who it feem was
the chief Officer among them, and all the reft, they
were as outragious as any of the Ship's Crew, ana
were no doubt made def perate in their new Enter-
prize,
prize, and terribly apprehenfive he was, that they
would be too powerful for us.
I fmil'd at him, and told him, that Men,in our
Circumftances were pan1 the Operation of Fear :
That feeing almoft every Condition that could be
\vas better than that which we werefuppos'd to be
in, we ought to expect that theConfequence, whe-
ther Death or Life, would be fure to be a Deli-
verance: I ask'd him, What he thought of the Cir-
cumftances of my Life? And, whether a Delive-
rance were not worth venturing for? And where,
Sir, faid I, is your Belief of my being preferv'd here
on purpofe to fave your Life, which elevated you
a little while ago? For my Parr, {aid I, there feetns
to be but one Thing amifsinall the Profpect of it;
Chat's that? Says he} why, faid I, 'Tis, that as you
fay, there are three or four honett Fellows among
them, which fhould be fpar'd } had they been all of
the wicked Part of the Crew, I fhould have thought
God's Providence had fingled them out to deliver
them into your Hands } for depend upon it, every
Man of them that comes a-fhore are our own, and
fhall die, or live, as they behave to us.
As 1 (poke this with a rais'd Voice and chearful
Countenance, I found it greatly encourag'd him } fo
we fet vigorously to our Bufinefs : We had upon the
firil Appearance of the Boat's coming from the Sh:p,
confider'd of feparating our Prifoners, and had in-
deed feciir'd them effectually.
, Two of them, of whom the Captain was lefs af-
fur'd than ordinary, I fent with Friday^ and one of
the three (dellver'd Men) to my Cave, where they
were remote enough, and out of Danger of being
heard or difcover'd, or of finding their way out of.
the Woods, if they could havedeliver'd themfelves:
Here they left them bound, but gave them Provifi-
and promis'd them if they continued there qui-
' X $ etly,
etiy, to give them thefr Liberty in a Day or two;
but that if they attempted their Efcape, theyfhould
'be put to Death without Mercy: They promis'd
faithfully to bear their Confinement with Patience,
and were very thankful that they had fuch good
Ufage, astohaveProvifions, and a Light leftthem;
for Friday gave them Candles (fuch as we made our
felves) for their Comfort; arid they did not know
but that he flood Sentinel over them at the En-
trance.
The other Prifoners had better Ufage; two of
them were kept pinion'd indeed, becaufe the Cap-
tain was not free to truft (hem; but the other two
were taken into my Service upon their Captain'sRe-
commendation, and upon their folemnly engaging
to live and die with us; fo with them and the three
honcft Men, we were feven Men, well arm'd; and
I made no doubt we fhou'd be able to deal well e-
nough with the Ten that were a coming, confi-
de' ing that the Captain had faid, there were three
or four honeft Men among them nlfo.
As foon as they got to the Place where their o-
ther Boat lay, they run their Boat in to the Beach,
and came all on Shore, hailing the Boat up after
them, which I was glad to fee ; for I was afraid
they would rather have left the Boat at an Anchor,
fome Diftance from the Shore, with fome Hands
in her, to guard her; and fo we fhould not be able
to feize the Boat.
Being on Shore, the firft Thing they did, they
ran all to their other Boar, and it was eafy to fee
that they were under a great Surprize, to find her
ftripp'd as above, of all that was in her, and a great
hole in her Bottom.
After they had mus'd a while upon this, they |
fet up two or three great Shouts, hollowing with |
all their might, to try if they could make their
Companions
Companions hear; but all was to no purpofe: Then
they came all clofe in a Ring, and fir'd.a Volley of
their fmall Arms, which indeed we heard, and the
Echoes made the Woods ring} but it was all one,
thofe in the Cave we were fure could not hear, and
thofe in our keeping, though they heard it well
enough, yet durft give no Anfwer to them.
They were fo aftonifh'd at the Surpri7e of this,
that as they told us afterwards, they refolv'd to gb
all on board again to their Ship, and let them know
there, that the Men were all murther'd, and the
Long-Boat ftav'd; accordingly they immediately
launch'd their Boat again, and gat all of them on
board.
The Captain was terribly amaz'd, and even con-
founded at this, bdieving they would go onboard
the Ship again, and fet Sail, giving their Comrades
for loft, and fo he fhould ftill lofe the Ship, which
he was in hopes we fhould have recover'd ; but he
was quickly as much frighted the other way.
They had not been long put off" with the Boat,
but we perceiv'd them all coming on Shore again;
b. ut with this new Meafure in their Conduct, which
• it feems they confulted together upon, viz. To
leave three Men in the Boat, and the reft to go on
Shore, and go up into the Country to look for their
Fellows.
This was a great Dfappointment to us; for now
we were at a Lofs what to do; for our feizing
thofe feven Men on Shore would be no Advantage
to us, if we let the Boat efcape; becaufe they
would then row away to the Ship, and then the
reft of them would be fure to weigh and fet Sail,
and fo our recovering the Ship would be lolt,
However, we had no Remedy, but to wait and
fee what the Iflue of Things might prefent; the
fe.ven Men came on Shore, and the three who rc-
. X 4 maio'd
maitfdin the Boat, put her off to a good Diftance
from the Shore, and came to an Anchor to wait for
tnemj fo that it was impoffible for us to come at
them in the Boat.
Thofe that came on fhore, kept clofe together,
"Tu "g towards the Top of the little Hill, under
which my Habitation lay } and we could fee them
plainly, though they could not perceive us: We
could have been very glad they would have come
nearer to us, fo that we might have fir'd at them,
'••' that they would have gone farther off, that we
might have come abroad.
But when they were come to the Brow of the
"il, where they could fee a great way into the
Valley.sand Woods, which lay towards ihcNertb-
y parr, and where the Ifland lay loweft, they
inouted, and hollow'd till they were weary; and
not caring it feems to venture far from the Shore,
nor far from one another, they fat down together
under a Tree, to confider of it: Had they thought
tit to have gone to fleep there, as the other Party
or them had done, they had done the Jobb for us;
but they were too full of Apprehenfions of Danger,
to venture to go to fleep, tho' they could not tell
What the Danger was they had to fear neither.
The Captain made a very juft Propofal to me,
upon this Confutation of theirs, viz. That per-
haps they would all fire a Volley again, to endea-
vour to make their Fellows hear, and that we
Ihpujd all felly upon them, juft'at the Jundure
when their Pieces were all difcharg'd, and they
Would cci raii;ly yield, and we fliould have them
without Blood-lhed: I lik'd the Propofal, provided
it was done \vlule we were near enough to come
up to them, before they could load their Pieces
again.,
'- But
But this Event .did not happen, and we lay ftiU
a long Time, very inetbUite what Courfe to take;
at length I told them, there would be nothing to
be done in my Opinion till Night, and then if they
did not return to the Boat, perhaps we might find
a way to get between them and the Shore, and fo
might ufe fome Stratagem with them in the Boat
to get them on Shove.
We waited a great while, though very impatient
for their removing j and were very uneafy, when,
after long Confultations, we faw them ftart all up,
and march down toward the Sea: It feems they had
fuch dreadful Apprehenfions upon them .of the
Danger of the Place, that they refolv'd to go op
board the Ship again, give their Companions over
for loft, and fo go on with their iritended^Voyage
with the Ship.
As foon as I perceiv'd them go toward.s the Shore,
I imagin'd it to be as it really was, That they had
given over their Search, and were for going back
again j and the Captain, as foon as I rbld him my
Thoughts, was ready to fink at the Apprehenfions
of itj but I prefently thought of a Stratagem to
fetch them back again, and which anfwer'd my
End to a Tittle.
1 order'd Friday^ and the Captain's Mate, to go
over the little Creek Pi^efiward^ towards the Place
where the Savages came on Shore, when Friday was
refcu'dj and as foon as they came to a little rifing
Ground, at about half a Mile Diftance, I bad them
hollow, as loud as they could, and' wait till they
found-tbe Seamen heard them; that as foon as ever
they heard the Seamen anfwer them, they ihould
return it again, and then keeping out of Sight, take
a round, always anfwering when the other hollow'd,
to draw them as far into the Ifland, and among the
Woods,
Woods, aspoflible, and then wheel about againtc,
Tie by fuch ways as I directed tliem. '
They were juft going into the Boat, when.Fr/-
iay and the Mate hollow'd, and they prefently heard
hem, and anfwering, run along the Shore fFeft-
ward, towards the Voice they heard, when they
were prefently Itopp'd by the Creek, where the
Water being up, they could not get over, nnd
rall'd for the Boat to come up, and let them over,
is indeed I ex peeled.
When they had fet themfelves over, I obferv'd,
hat the Boat being gone up a good way into the
Dretk, and as it were in a Harbour within the
Land, they took one of the three Men out of her
o go along with them, and left only two in the
Soar, having faftned her to the Stump of a little
free o.n the Shore.
This was what I wiuYd forj and immediately
caving Friday and the Captain's Mate to their Bufi-
icfs, 1 took the reft with me, and eroding the
>eck out of their Sight, we furpriz'd the two
^len before they were aware j one of them lying on
Shore, and the other being in the Boat; the Fellow
in Shore, was between deeping and waking, and go-
ng to ftart up, the Captain who wasforemoft,ranin
ipon him,and knock'd him down,and then call'dout
0 him in the Boat to yield, or he wasadead Man.
There needed very few Arguments to perfuade
fingle Man to yield, when he faw five Men upon
im, and his Comrade knock'd downj befides, this
/as it fecms one of the three who were not fo hearty
1 the Mutiny as the reft of the Crew, and there-
jre was eafily perfuaded, not only to yield, butar-
;rwards to join very fincerely with us. v
In the mean time, Friday. and the Captain's Mate
> well manag'd their" Bufinefs with the reft, that
icy drew them by hollowing and anfwering, from

ther, till they not only heartily tir'd them, but left
tliem, where they were very fure they could not
reach back to the Boat, before it was dark j and^g-
deed they were heartily tir'd.themfelves alfo.bythe
Time they, came back to us.
We had nothing now to do, but to watch for
them in the dark, and to fall upon them, Ib as to
make fure work with them.
It was feveral Hours after Friday came back to
me, before they came back to their Boat } and we
could hear the foremoll of them long before
they came quite up, calling to thofe behind to
come along, and could alfo hear them anfwer and
complain how lame and tir'd they were, and not
able to come any fafter, which was very welcome
News to us.
At length they cajne up to the Boat} but 'tis
impoflible to exprefs their Confufion, when they
found the Boat fatt a.ground in the Creek, the
Tide ebb'd out, and their two Men gone: We
could hear them call to one another in a mot t la-
mentable Manner, telling one another they were
gotten into an inchanted Ifland; that either there
were Inhabitants in it, and they fhould all be mur-.
ther'd, or clfe there were Devils and Spirits in it,
and they fhould be all carry'd away, and devour'd.
They hollow'd again, and call'd their two Com-
rades by their Names a great many times, but
no Anfwer. After fome time, we could fee
them, by the little Light there was, run about
wringing their Hands like Men in Defpairj and
that Ibmetimes they would go and fit down in the
Boat to reft themfelvos, then come afhore again,
and walk about again, and fo the fame thing over
again.
My
My Men would fain have me give them Leave
to fall upon them at once in the Dark; but I was
willing to take them at fome Advantage, fo to
fgare them, and kill as few of them as f could} Of U5
and ei'pecially I was unwilling to hazard the killing
any of our own Men, knowing the other were ve-
ry well armed. 1 refolved to wait to fee if they
did not feparatej and therefore to make lure of
them, I drew my Ambufcade nearer, and order'd fo
Friday and the Captain to creep upon their Hands to 0[,
and Feet as clofe to the Ground as they could, anfW(
that they might not be difcover'd, and get as near . ^ ^
them as they could poffibly, before they offered to
fire. '
They had not been long in that Pofture, but that
the Boatfwain, who was the principal Ringleader
of the Mutiny, and had now fhewn himfelf the a
moft dejected and difpirited of all the reft, came °
walking towards them with two more of their
Crew j the Captain was fo eager, as having this js
principal Rogue fo much in his Power, that he
could hardly have Patience to let him come fo
near, as to be fure of him j for they only heard
his Tongue before: But when they came nearer,
the Captain and Friday ttarting up on their Feet,
let fly at them.
The Boatfwain was kill'd upon the Spot, the
next Man was fhot into the Body, and fell juft by ^.
him, tho' he did not die till an Hour or two after;
md the third run for it.
At the Noiie of the Fire, I immediately ad-
;anc'd with my whole Army, which was now o
VIen, viz. my felf Generali/mo, Friday my Lieu-
:enant^General, the Captain and his two Men, and
he three Prifoners of War, who we had crufted
vith Arms.
We hls
We came upon them indeed in the Dark, fa that
they could not fee our Number; and I made the
Man we had left in the Boat, who was now one
of us, call to them by Name, to try if I could
bring them to a Parley, and fo might perhaps re-
duce them to Terms, which fell out juft as we de-
fir'd : For indeed it was eafy to think, as their
Condition then was, they would be very willing
to capitulate; fo he calls out as loud as he could,
to one of them, Tom Smith, Tom Smith; Tom Smith
anfwer'd immediately, Who's that, Robinfon? for
it feems he knew his Voice : T'other anfwer'd, Ay,
ay; for God's Sake, Tom Smith, throw down your
Arms, and yield, or, you are all dead Men this Mo-
ment.
Who muft we yield to ? inhere are they ? (fays Smith
again;) Here they are, fays he, here's our Captain,
and fifty Men with him, have been hunting you
this two Hours; the Boatfwain is kill'd, WillFrye
is wounded, and I am aPriloner; and if you do not
yield, you are all loft.
Will they give us Quarter then, (fays Tom
Smith) and we will yield ? /'// go and ask, if you
promife to yield, fays 'Robinfon; fo he ask'd the Cap-
tain, and the Captain then calls himfelf out, You
Smith, you know my Voice, if you Jay down your
Arms immediately, and fubmit, you fhall have your
Lives all but Will. Atkins.
Upon this, Will, dtkins cry'd out, For God's fake,
Captain^ give me Quarter, 'what have 1 done ? They
have been all as bad as I, which by the way was not
true neither; for.it feems this Will. Atkins was the
firll Man that laid hold of the Captain, when they
'firft mutiny'd, and ufed him barbaroufly, in tying
his Hands, and giving him injurious Language.
However, .the Captain told him he muft lay down
his Arms ac Difcretion, and truft to the Gover-
nour's
nour's Mercy,^by which he meant me; for they
all cull'd me Governour.
In a word, they all laid down their Arms, and
jgg'd their Lives; and I Cent the Man that had
p.uly'd with them, and two more, who bound
them all; and then my great Army of fo Men,
which particularly with thole three, were all but
eight, came up and feiz'd upon them all, and upon
their Boat, only that I kept my felf and one more
out of Sight, for Reafons of State.
Our next Work was to repair the Boat, and
think of feizing the Ship; and as for the Captain,
now he had Leifure to parly with them: He expo-
fulatcd with them upon theVillanyof theirPra-
ctices with him, and at length upon the farther
Wickedncfs of their Defign, and how certainly it
tnuft bring them to Mifery and Diilrefs in the End,
and perhaps to the Gallows.
They all appear'd very penitent, and begg'dhard
for their Lives : as for that, he told them they
were none of his Prifoners, but the Commander of
the Ifland > that they thought they had fet him on
Shore in a barren uninhabitated Ifland, but it had
pleafed .God fo to direct them, that the Ifland
was inhabited, and that the Governour was an
Engliftj Man; that he might hang them all there, if
he pleafed; but as he had given them all Quarter,
he fuppoftd he would fend them to England to be
dealt with there, as Juftice requir'd, except At-
kins, who he was commanded by the Governour to
advife to prepare for Death; for that he would be
hang'd in the Morning.
Though this was all a Fi£Hon of his own, yet
it had its defired Effeft; Atkins fell upon his Knees
to beg the Captain to intercede with the Gover-
nour for his Life j and all the reft begg'd of him
for
for God's Sake, that they might not be fent to
England:
It now occurr'd to me, that the time of our De-
liverance was come, and that it would be a moft
eafy thing to bring thefe Fellows in, to be hearty
in getting Pofleflion of the Ship } fo I retir'd in the
Dark from them, that they might not fee what
Kind of a Governour they had, and call'd the Cap-
tain to me. W hen I call'd, as at a good Diftance,
one of the Men was order'd to fpeak again, and fay
to the Captain, Captain, the Commander calls for
you; and prefently the Captain reply'd, Tell bis
Excellency I am jlift a coming: This more perfect-
ly amufed them; 'and they all believed that the
Commander was juft by with his fifty Men.
Upon the Captain's coming to me, I told him
%iy Projcct forfeizing the Ship, which he lik'dof
•wonderfully well, and refolv'd to put it in Execu-
tion the next Morning.
But in order to execute it with more Art, and
fecurity of Succefs, I told him, we muft divide the
Prifoners, and that he fhould go and take Atkins
and two more of the worft of them, and fend them
pinion'd to the Cave where the others lay: This
was committed to Friday and the two Men who
came on Shore with the Captain.
They convey'd them to the Cave, as to a Pri- '
fon ; and it was indeed a difmal Place, efpecially to
Men in their Condition.
The other I order'd to my Bower^ as I call'd flp
of which 1 have given a full Description j ana
as it was fcnc'd in, and they pinion'd, the Place
. was fecure enough, confidering they were upon
their Behaviour.
To thefe in the Morning I fent the Captain, who
was to enter into a Parley with them, in a Word
to try them, and tell me, whether he thought they
might
might be trufted or no, to go on Board and furprize
the Ship. He talk'd to them of the Injury done
him, of the Condition they were brought to; and
that though the Governour had given them Quar-
ter for their Lives, as to the prefent Action, yet
that if they were Tent to England^ they would all
be hnng'd in Chains, to be fure j blu that if•they
would join in fo juft an Attempt, as to recover the
Ship, he would have the Govcrnour's Engagement
for their Pardon.
Any one may guels how readily fuch a Propofal
would be accepted by Men in their Condition;
they fell down on their Knees. to the Captain, and
promifed with the deepeft Imprecations, that they
would be faithful to him to'thelaft Drop, and
that they fhould owe their Lives to him, and
would go with him all over the World, thatch^y
would own him for a Father to them as long as
they liv'd.
Well, fays the Captain, I muft go and tell the
Governour what you fay, and fee what I can do
to bring him to confent to it: So he brought me
an Account of the Temper he found them in;
and that he verily believ'd they would be faith-
ful.
However, that we might be very fecure, I told
him he fhould go back again, and chufe out thole
five, and tell them, they might fee that he did not
want Men, that he would take out thofe five to be
his Affiftants, and that the Governour would keep
the other two, and the three that were fent Prifo-
ners to the Cattle (my Cave) as Hoftages, for the
Fidelity of thofe five} and that if they prov'd un-
faithful in the Execution, the five Holtages fhould
be hang'd in Chains alive upon the Shore.
This look'd fevere, andconvinc'd them that the
Governour
Governour was in Earneft} however they had' rid
Way left them, but to accept it j • and it was now1
the Bufinefs of the Prifoners, as much as of the
Captain, to perfuade the other five to do their
Duty.
Our Strengjh was now thus ordered for the Ex-
pedition: i. The Captain, his Mate, and Paflen-
ger. i. Then the two Prifoners of the firft Gang,
to whom having their Characters from the Captain,
I had given their Liberty, and trufted them with
Arms. 3. The other two who I had kept till now$
in my Bower, pinion'dj but upon the Captain's
Motion, had now releas'd. 4. Thefe five releas'd
at laft : So that they were twelve in all, befides five
we kept Prifoners in the Cave, for Hoftages.
I ask'd the Captain, if he was wHling to ven-
ture with thefe Hands on Board the Ship ; for
as. for me and my Man Friday, 1 did not think
it was proper for us to ftir, having feven Men
left behind j and it was Employment enough for
us to keep them afunder, and fupply them with
Victuals.
As to the five in the Cave, I refolv'd to keep
them faft, but Friday went in twice a Day to them,.
to fupply them with NecefTariesj and I made the
other two carry Provisions to a certain Diftance^
where Friday was to take it.
When. I fhew'd my felf to the two Hoftages, it
was with'the Captain, who told them, I was the
Perfon this Governour had order'd to look after
them, and that it was the Governour's Pleafure they
fhould not ftir any where, 'but by my Directi-
on i that if they did, they ihould be fetch'd into,
the Cattle, and be lay'd in Irons i fo that as we
never fuffered them to fee me as Governour, fo I
nowappear'd as another Perfon, and fpoke of the
Y Gover-
jovernour, the Gaiifon, the Cattle, and the like,
ipon all Occafions. ,
The Captain now had no Difficulty before him,
5Ut to furnifh his two Boats, flop the Breach of rj
Dnc, and Man them. He made his Paflenger j
Captain of one, with four other Men; and him- ,-
felf, and his Mate, and five more went in the o- r
ther: And they contriv'd their Bufinefs very well} J' ;
for they came up to the Ship about Midnight: As
Toon as they came within Call of the Ship, he made
Robinfon hale them, and tell them they had brought
off the Men and the Boat, but that it was a long ^
time before they had found them, and the like;
holding them in a Chat till they came to the Ship's |a
fide; when the Captain and the Mate, entring or
firft with their Arms, immediately knock'd down ^
the fecond Mate and Carpenter with the But-end
of their Muskets. Being very faithfully feconded
by their Men, they fecur'd all the reft that were
upon the Main and Quarter Decks, and began to
faften the Hatches to keep them down who were
below, when the other Boat and their Men entring
at the fore Chains, fecur'd the Fore-Caftle of the
Ship, and the Scuttle which went down into the
Cook-Room, making three Men they found there
T% 'f ' 1*
Pnfoners. to
When this was done, and all fafe upon Decline
Captain order'd the Mate with three Men to break
into the Round-Houfe, where the new Rebel Cap-
tain lay, and having taken the Alarm, was gotten
up, and with two Men and a Boy had gotten Fire
Arms in their Hands, and when the Mate with a
Crow fplit open the Door, the new Captain and
his Men fir'd boldly among them, and wounded the
Mate with a Musket Ball, which broke his Arm,
and wounded two more of the Men, but kill a
no Body. I S]
The Mate calling for Help, rufh'd however in-
to the Round-Houfe, wounded as he was, and
with his Piftol fhot the new Captain thro' the
Head, the Bullet entring at his Mouth, and came
out again behind one of his Ears; fo that he never
fpoke a Word; upon which the reft yielded, and
the Ship was taken effectually, without any more
Lives loll.
As foon as the Ship was thu& fecur'd, the Cap-
tain order'd feven Guns to be fir'd, which was the
Signal agreed upon with me, to give me Notice
of his Succefs, which you may be fure I was very
glad to hear, having fat watching upon the Shore
for it till near two of the Clock in the Morning.
Having thus heard the Signal plainly, I laid me
downj and it having been a Day of great Fatigue
to me, I flept very found, till 1 was fomething fur-
priz'd with the Noife of a Gun; and prefently
flatting up, I heard a Man call roe by the Name of
Governour, Governour, and prefently I knew the
Captain's Voice, when climbing up to the Top of
the Hill, there he flood, and pointing to the Ship,
he embrac'd me in his Arms, My dear Friend and
Deliverer^ fays he, there's your Ship,forjhe is all yours^
andfo are -we and all that belong to her. I caft my Eyes
to the Ship, and rhere fhe rode within little more
than half a Mile of the Shore; for they had weigh-
ed her Anchor as foon as they were Mafters of her;
and the Weather being fair, had brought her to an
Anchor juft againft'the Mouth of the little Creek j
and the Tide being up, the Captain had brought
the Pinnace in near the Place where I at firft land-
ed my Rafts, and fo landed juft at my Door.
I was at firft ready to fink down with the Sur-
prize. For I faw my Deliverance indeed vifibly
put into my Hands, all things eafy, and a large
Ship juft ready to carry me away whither I plea-
Y i " fed
fed to go. At firft, for fome time, I was not able
to anfwer him one Word j but as he had taken me
in his Arms, I held faft by him, or I fhould have
fallen to the Ground.
He perceived the Surprize, and immediately
pulls a Bottle out of his Pocket, and gave me a
.Dram of Cordial, which he had brought on pur-
pofe for me j after I had drank it, I fat down up-
on the Ground ; and though it brought me to my
felf, yet it was a good while before I could fpeak
a Word to him.
All this while the poor Man was in as great an
Extafy as I, only not under any Surprize, as I was;
and he faid a thoufand kind tender things to me, to
compofe me and bring me to my felf j but fuch was
the Flood of Joy in my Breaft, that it put all my
Spirits into Confufionj at laft it broke out into
Tears, and in a little while after, I recovered my
Speech.
Then I took my Turn, and embrac'd him as
my Deliverer} and we rejoic'd together. I told
him, I look'd upon him as a Manfent from Heaven
to deliver me, and that the whole Tranfa&ion
feemed to be a Chain of Wonders 5 that fuch things
as thefe were the Teilimonies we had of a feciet
Hand of Providence governing the World, and an
Evidence, that the Eyes of an infinite Power could
fearch into the remoteft Corner of the World, and
fend Help to the Miferable whenever hepleas'd.
I forgot not to lift up my Heart in Thankful-
nefs to Heaven, and what Heart could forbear to
blefs him, who had not only in a miraculous Man-
ner provided for one in fuch a Wildernefs, and
in. fuch a defolateCondition, but from whom every
Deliverance mud always be acknowledged to pro-
cee-d. . ;
When
When we had talk'd a while, the Captain told
me he had brought me fome little Refrefhment,
fnch as the Ship afforded, and fuch as the Wretches
that had been fo long his Mafters had not plunder'd
him of: Upon this he call'd aloud to the Boat, and
bid his Men bring the things afhore that were for
the Governourj and indeed it was a Prefent, as if
I had been one not that was to be carry'd away
along with them, but as if I had been to dwell
upon the Ifland ftill, and they were to go without
me.
Firft he had brought me a Cafe of Bottles full
of excellent Cordial Waters, fix large Bottles of
Madura Wine j the Bottles held two Quarts a-piece}
two Pound of excellent good Tobacco, twelve good
Pieces of the Ships Beef, and fix Pieces of Pork,
with a Bag of Peafe, and about a hundredweight
of Bisket.
He brought me alfo a Box of Sugar, a Box of
Flower, a Bag full of Lemons, and two Bottles
of Lime-juice, and abundance of other things:
But befides thefe, and what was a thoufand times
more ufeful to me, he brought me fix clean new
Shirts, fix very good Neckcloaths, two Pair of
Gloves, one Pair of Shoes, a Hat, and one Pair of
Stockings, and a very good Suit of Cloaths of his
own, which had been worn but very little: In a
Word, he cloathed me from Head to Foot.
It was a very kind and agreeable Prefent, as any
one may imagine, to one in my Circumftances: But
never was any thing in the World of that Kind fo
unpleafanf, awkard, and uneafy, as it was to me to
wear fuch Cloaths at their firlt putting on.
After thefe Ceremonies paft, and after all his
good things were brought into my little Apart-
ment, we began to confult what was to be dqne
with the Prifoners we had; for it was worth con.
Y J fidcrin^
iidering, whether we might venture to take them
uvay with us or no, efpecially two of them, who
we knew to be incorrigible and refractory to the
\i\ Degree; and the Captain faid, he knew they
were fuch Rogues, that there was no obliging
them, and if he did carry them away, it mult be
in Irons, as Malefactors to be delivered over to Ju-
llice at the firft Englijh Colony he {hould come at;
and J found that the Captain himfelf was very au-
xious about it.
Upon this, I told himr that if he defir'd it, I
durft undertake to bring the two Men he fpokc of,
to make it their own Requeft that he fhould leave
them upon the Ifland:' IJhould be •very glad of that,
fays the Captain, with all my Heart,
Well, fays I, I will fend for them up, and talk
with them for you; fa I caufcd Friday and the two
Hoftages, for they were now difcharg'd, their Com-
rades having perform'd their Promife} I fay, I cau-
!cd them to go to the Cave, and bring up the five
Men pinion'd, as they were, to the Bower, and
keep them there 'till I came.
After feme time, I came thither drefs'd in ray
new Habit, and now 1 was call'd Governouragain;
being all met, and the Captain with me, I caufed
the Men to be brought before me, and I told them,
I had had a full Account of their villainous Beha-
viour to the Captain, and how they had run away
with the Ship, and were preparing to commit far-
ther Robberies, but that Providence had en-
fnar'd them in their own Ways, and that they
were fallen into the Pit which they had digged tor
others.
I let them know, that by my Direction the Ship
had been feiz'd, that fhe lay now in the Road; and
they might fee by and by, that their new CaPtai"

had receiv'd the Reward of his Villany j for that
they might fee him hanging at the Yard-Arm.
That as to them, I wanted to know what they
had to fay, why I fhould not execute them as Pi-
rates taken in the Fact, as by my Commiffion they
could not doubt I had Authority to do.
One of them anfwer'd in the Name of the reft,
That they had nothing to fay but this, That when
they were taken the Captain promis'd them their
Lives, and they humbly implor'd my Mercy: But
I told them, I knew not what Mercy to fhew them }
for as for my felf, I had refolv'd to quit the
Ifland with all my Men, and had taken Paflage
with the Captain to go for England: And as for
the Captain, he could not carry them to England
other than as Prifoners in Irons, to be try'd for
Mutiny, and running away'with the Ship ; the
Confequence of which, they muft needs know,
would be the Gallows; fo that I could not tell
which was beft for them, urjefs they had a mind
to take their Fate in the Ifland } if they defir'd that,
I did not care, as I had Liberty to leave it, I had
fome Inclination to give them their Lives, if they
thought they could fhift on Shore.
They feem'd very thankful for it, faidthey would
much rather venture to flay there, than to be car-
ry'd to 'England to be hang'd , fo I left it on that
Iflue.
However, the Captain feem'd to make fome
Difficulty of it, as if he durft not leave them
there : Upon this I feem'd a little angry with the
Captain, and told him, That they were my Prifo-
ners, not his y and that feeing I had offer'd them
fo much Favour,'! would be as good as my Word >
and that if he did not think fit to confent to it, t
would fct them at Liberty as I found them; and
Y4 if
if he did not like it, he might take them again it
he could catch them.
Upon this they appeared very thankful, and I ac-
cordingly fet them at Liberty, and bad them retire
into the Woods to the Place whence they came,
and I would leave them Come Fire Arms, fome
Ammunition, and fome Directions how they fhould
live very well, if they thought fit.
Upon this I prepar'd to go on Board the Ship,
but told the Captain, that I would ftay that Night
to prepare my Things, and defir'd him to go on
Board in the mean time, and keep all right in the
Ship, and fend the Boat on Shore the next Day for
me ; ordering him in the mean time to caufe the
new Captain, who was kill'd, to be hang'd at the
Yard-Arm, that thefe Men might fee him.
When the Captain was gone, I fent for the Men
up to me to my Apartment, and entred feriouily
into Difcourfe with them of their Circumftances.
I told them, I thought they had made a right
Choice j that if the Captain carry'd them away,
they would certainly be hanged. 1 fhewed them
the new Captain, hanging at the Yard-Arm of the
Ship, and told them they had nothing lefsto exptft.
When they had all declar'd their Willingndsto
ftay, I then told them, I would let them into the
Story of my living there, and put them into the
Way of making it eafie to them. Accordingly I
gave them the whole Hiftory of the Place, and of
my coming to it; fhew'd them my Fortifications,
the way 1 made my Bread, planted my Corn, cu-
red my Grapes j and in a word, all that was nc-
:eflary to make them eafy: I told them the Story
ilfo of the fixteen Spaniards that were to be expe-
lled j for whom 1 left a Letter, and made them
promife to preat them in common with themfelves.

I left them my Fire Arms, viz. Five Muskets,
three Fowling Pieces, and three Swords. I had
above a Barrel and half of Powder left; for after
the firft Year or two, I ufed but little, and wafted
none. I gave thera a Defcriptiow of the Way I
manag'd the Goats, and Directions to milk and
fatten them, and to make both Butter andCheefe.
In a word, I gave them every Part of my own
Story i and I told them, I would prevail with the
Captain to leave them two Barrels of Gun-Powder
more, and fome Garden-Seeds, which I told them
I would have been very glad of; alfo I gave them
the Bag of Peafe which the Captain had brought
me to eat, and bade them be fure to fow and en-
creafe them.
Having done all this, I left them the next Day,
nnd went on Board the Ship: We prepared imme-
diately to fail, but did not weigh that Night:
The next Morning early, two of the five Men
came fwimming to the Ship's Side, and making a
moft lamentable Complaint of the other three, beg-
ged to be taken into the Ship, for God's fake, for
they fhould be murthered, and begg'd the Captain
to take them on Board, though he hang'd them
immediately.
Upon this the Captain pretended to have no.
Power without me } but after fome Difficulty,
and after their fplemn Promifes of Amendment,
they were taken on Board, and were fome time af-
ter foundly whipp'd and pickl'd j after which,
they prov'd very honeft and quiet Fellows.
Some time after this, the Boat was order'd on
Shore, the Tide being up, with the Things promi-
fed to the Men, to which the Captain, at mylnter-
ceffion, caufed their Chefts and Cloaths to be add-
ed, which they took, and were very thankful forj
I alfo encourag'd them, by telling them, that if
it
it lay in my way to fend any Veflel to take them in,
I would not forget them.
When I took leave of this Ifland, I carry'd on
Board for Reliques the great Goat's-Skin-Cap I
had made, my Umbrella, and my Parrot; alfo I
forgot not to take the Money I formerly mention'd,
which had lain by me fo long ufelcfs, that it was
grown rufty, or tarnifh'd, and could hardly pafs
for Silver, till it had been a little rubb'd, and han-
dled ; as alfo the Money I found in the Wreck of
the Spanijh Ship.
And thus I left the Ifhnd, the Nineteenth of
December, as I found by the Ship's Account, in
the Year 1686, after 1 had been upon it eight and
twenty Years, two Months, and 19 Days; being
deliver'd from this fecond Captivity, the fame Day
of the Month that I firft made my Efcape in the
Barco-LongO) from among the Moors of Sallee.
In this Veflel, after a long Voyage, I arriv'd in
England the Eleventh of June, in the Year 1687,
having been thirty and five Years abfent.
When I came to. England^ I was as perfect a
Stranger to all the World, as if I had never been
known there. My Benefactor and faithful Stew-
ard, who I had left in Trull with my Money, was
alive, but had had great Misfortunes in the World;
was become a Widow the fecond Time, and very low
in the World: I made her eafy as to what fhe ow'd
me, afluring her, I would give her no Trouble; but
on the contrary, in Gratitude to her former Care
and Faithfulnefs to me, I reliev'd her, as my little
Stock would afford, which at that Time would
indeed allow me to do but little for her j but I af-
fiir'd her,I would never forget her former Kindnefs
to mej nor did I forget her^ when I had fufficient
to help her, as {hall be obferv'd in its place.
i
I wept
I went down afterwards into Yorkjhire; but my
Father was dead, and my Mother, and all the Fa-
mily extinct, except that I found two Sifters, and
two of the Children of one of my Brothers, and as
1 had been long ago given over for dead, there had
been no Provifion made for me; fo that in a Word,
I found nothing to relieve, or. affift mej and that
little Money I had, would not do much for me, as
to fettling in the World.
I met with one Piece of Gratitude indeed, which
I did not expect; and this was, That the Mafter
of the Ship, who I had fo happily deliver'd, and
by the fame Means fav'd the Ship and Cargo, ha-
ving given a very handfome Account to the Own-
ers, of the Manner how I had fav'd the Lives of
the^Men, and the Ship, they invited me to meet
them, and fome other Merchants concern'd, and
all together made me a very handfome Compliment
upon the Subject, and a. Prefent of alfnoft two
hundred Pounds .Sterling. ,
But after making feveral Reflections upon the
Circumftances of my Life, and how little way this
would go towards fettling me in the World, I re-
folv'd to go to jLw£o#, and fee if I might not come
by fome Information of the State of my Plantation
in ihe Brafils, and of what was become of my Part-
ner, who I had reafon to fuppofe had fome Years
now given me over for dead.
With this View I took Shipping for Lisbon^
where I arriv'd in Jlpril following; my Man Fri-
day accompanying me very honeftly in all thefe
Rarnblings, and proving a moft faithful Servant up-
on all Occafions.
When I came to Lisbon^ I found out by Enqui-
ry, and to my particular Satisfaction, my old Friend
the Captain of the Ship, who firll took me up at
Sea, off of the Shore of Aftick: He was now
• , grown
grown old, and had left off the Sea, having put I a:
his Son, who was far from a young Man, into his prove
Ship} and who ftill ufed the Brafil Trade. The Whci
old Man did not know me, and indeed I hardly ter? i
knew him $ but I foon brought him to my Remem- meet
brance, and as foon brought my felf to his Remem- Righ
brance, when I told him who I was. He
After fome paffionate Expreflions of the old Ac- • Degn
quaintance, I enquir'd, you may be fure, after my knew,
Plantation and my Partner: The old Man told me upon
he had not been in the Brafils for about nine Years; the be
but that he could aflure me, that when he came the K
away my Partner was living j but the Truftees, grants
who I had join'd with him to take Cognizance of
my Part, were both dead; that however, he be-
liev'd that I would have a very good Account of quiet
the Improvement of the Plantation} for that upon made
the general Belief of my being caft away, and "Title
drown'd, my Truftees had given in the Account of
the Produce of my Part of the Plantation, to the
Procurator Fifcal, who had appropriated it, in
cafe I never came to claim it j one Third to the I
King, and two Thirds to the Monaftery of St. A*- me ir;
lufiine^ to be expended for the Benefit of the Poor, Sum ,
ind for theConverfion of the Indium to theCatho- being
tick Faith j but that if I appear'd, or any one for held
tne, to claim the Inheritance, it fhould be reftor'd; "ove,
anly that the Improvement, or annual Production,
icing diftributed to charitable Ufes, could not be
•eftor'd} but he aiTur'd me, that the Steward of
:he King's Revenue (from Lands) and the Provedi-
lore, or Steward of the Monaftery, had taken great
:are all along, that the Incumbent, that is to fay,
ny Partner, gave every Year a faithful Account or
he Produce, of which they receiv'd duly ray
vloiety.
I asfc'd
I ask'd him if he knew to what height of Im-
provement he had brought the Plantation? And,
"Whether he thought it might be worth looking af-
ter? Or, Whether on my going thither, I mould
meet with no Obftru&ion to my poflefling my juft
Right in the Moiety ?
He told me, he could not tell exactly to what
Degree the Plantation was improv'd } but this he
knew, that my Partner was grown exceeding rich
upon the enjoying but one half of it} and that to
the beft of his Remembrance, he had heard, that
the King's Third of my Parr, which was it feems
granted away to fome other Monaftery, or Religi-
ous Houfe, amounted to above two hundred Moi-
dores a Year; that as to my being reftor'd to a
quiet Pofleffion of it, there was no queftion to be
made of thar, my Partner being alive towitnefs my
Title, and my Name being alfo enrolled in the
Regifter of the Country} alfo he told me, That
the Survivors of my two Truftees were very fair
honet t People, and very wealthy} and he believ'd
I would not only have their Affiftance for putting
me in poiTeffion, but would find a very considerable
Sum of Money in. their Hands, for my account j
being the Produce of the Farm while their Fathers
held the Truft, and before it was given up as a-
bove, which, as he remember'd, was for about
twelve Years.
I fhew'd my felf a little concern'd, and uneafy at
this Account, and enquir'd of the old Captain, How
it came to pafs, that the Truftees fhould thus dif-
pofe my Effe&s, when he knew that 1 had made ray
Will, and had made him, the Portuguefe Captain,
my univerfal Heir, &c.
He told me, that was true} but that as there
\vas no Proof of my being dead, he could not act
as Executor, until {ome certain Account fhould
come
come of my Death, and that befides, he was not
willing to intermeddle with a thing fo remote}
that it was true he had regifter'd my Will,
and put in his Claim j and could he have given
any Account of my being dead or alive, he would
have acted by Procuration, and taken Pofleffion of
the Ingenio, fo they call'd the Sugar-Houfe,and had
given his Son, who was now at the Brafils, Order
co do it.
But, fays the old Man, I have one Piece of
News to tell you, which perhaps may not be fo
acceptable to you as the reft, and that is, That
believing you were loft, and all the World believ-
ing fo alfo, your Partner and Truftees did of-
fer to accompt to me in your Name, for fix or
eight of the firft Years of Profits, which I receiv'd;
but there being at that time, fays he, great Dif-
burfements for encreafing the Works, building an
Ingenioy and buying Slaves, it did not amount to
near fo much as afterwards it produced : However,
fays the old Man, I fhall give you a true Account
of what I have received in all, and how I have
difpofed of it.
After a few Days farther Conference with this
ancient Friend, he brough t me an Account of the fix
firft Years Income of my Plantation, fign'd by my
Partner and the Merchants Truftees, being al-
ways deliver'd in Goods, viz. Tobacco in Roll,
and Sugar in Chefts, befides Rum, Moloflus, &(•
which is the Confequence of a Sugar Work; and
-I found by this Account, that every Year the In-
come confiderably encreafcd; but as above, the
Disburfement being large, the Sum at firft was
fmall: However, the old Man let me fee, that he
was Debtor to me 47o"Moidores of Gold, befiaes
60 Chefts of Sugar, and if double Rolls of .To-
bacco which were loft in his Ship i he having been
Ship-
Ship-wreck'd coming Home to Lisbon about II
Years after my leaving the &lj£fi*'•'::': •,.•«?:"!*N;•
The good Man then began to complain of his
Misfortunes, and how he had been oblig'd to make
Ufe of my Money to recover his Lofles, and buy
him a Share in a new Ship: However, my old
Friend, fays he, you'fhall not want a Supply in your
Neceffity; and as foon as my Son returns, you fhall
be fully fatisfy'd.
Upon this, he pulls out an old Pouch, and
gives me 160 Portugal Moidores in Gold; and giv-
ing me the Writing of his Title to the Ship, which
his Son was gone to the Brafils in, of which
he was a Quarter Part Owner, and his Son another,
he puts them both into, my Hands for Security of
the reft.
I was too much mov'd with the Honefty and
Kindnefs of the poor Man, to be able to bear this j
and remembring whar he had done for me, how
he had taken me up at Sea, and how generoufly he
had ufed me on all Occafions, and particularly,
how fincere a Friend he was now to me, I could
hardly refrain weeping at what he faid to me:
Therefore firft I asked him, if his Circumftances
admitted him to fpare fo much Money at that time,
and if it would not ftraitcn him? He told me, he
could not fay but it might ftraiten him a little j but
however it was my Money, and I might want it
more than he.
Every thing the good Man faid was full of Af-
fection, and I could hardly refrain from Tears
while he fpoke: In fhort, \ took 100 of the Moi-
dores, and eall'd for a Pen and Ink to give him a
Receipt for them, then 1 returned him the reft, and
told him, If ever I had Polleffion of the Plantation,
I would return the other to him alfo, as indeed I af-
terwards did j and that as to the Bill of Sale of
his
his Part in his Son's Ship, I would not take it by
any Means; but that if I wanted the Money, I
found he was honeft enough to pay me; and if I
did not, but came to receive what he gave me rea-
fon to expect, I would never have a Penny more
from him.
When this was pafs'd, the old Man began to ask
me, If he fhould put me into a Method to make my
Claim to my Plantation ? I told him, I thought to
go over to it my felf: He faid, I might do fo if I
pleas'd; but that if I did not, there were ways e-
nough to fecure my Right, and immediately to ap-
propriate the Profits to my Ufe; and as there were
Ships in the River of Lisbon^ juft ready to go away
to Bra/il, he made me enter my Name in a publick
Regifter, with his Affidavit, affirming upon Oath
that I was alive, and that I was the fame Perfon
who took up the Land for the Planting the faid
Plantation at firft.
This being regularly attefred by a Notary, and
i Procuration affix'd, he directed me to fend it with
i Letter of his Writing, to a Merchant of his Ac-
quaintance at the Place, and then propos'd'my
laying with him till an Account came of the re-
urn.
Never any Thing was more honourable, than
he Proceedings upon this Procuration } for in lefs
han feven Months I receiv'd a large Packet from
he Survivors of my Truftees the Merchants, tor
vhofe Account I went to Sea, in which were the
allowing particular Letters and Papers, enclos'd.
Firft, There was the Account current of the
'roduce of my Farm, or Plantation, from the Year
?hen their Fathers had ballanc'd with my old For-
igal Captain, being for fix Years; the Ballancc ap-
sar'd to be 1174 Moidores in .my Favour.

 Secondly, There was the Account of four Years
more while they kept the Effects in their Hands,
before the Government claim'd the Adminiftrati-
on, as being the Effects of a Perfon not to be
found, which they call Civil Death; and the Bal-
lance of this, the Value of the Plantation encrea-
fing, amounted to Cruifadoes, which made
3141 Moidores.
Thirdly, There was the Prior of the Auguftine's
Account, who had receiv'd the Profits for above
fourteen Years ; but not being to account for what
was difpos'd to the Hofpital, very honeftly de-
clar'd he had 871 Moidores not diftributed, which
he acknowledged to my Account j as to the King's
Part, that refunded nothing.
There was a Letter of my Partner's, congratu-
lating me very affectionately upon my being alive,
giving me an Account how the Eftate was im-
prov'd, and what it produced a Year, with a Par-
ticular of the Number of Squares or Acres that it
contain'd; how planted, how many Slaves there
were upon it, and making two and twenty Crofles
for Blemngs, told.me he had faid.fo many Ave Ma-
ria's to thank the Blefled Virgin that I was alive j
inviting me very paffionately to come over and
take Pofleflion of my own; and in the mean time
to give him Orders to whom he fhould deliver ray
Effects, if I did not come my felf., concluding
with a hearty Tender of his Friendfhip, and that
of his Family, and fent me, as a Prelent, feven
fine Leopard's Skins, which he had it feems recei-
ved from Africa, by fome other Ship which he had
fent thither, and who it feems had made a better
Voyage than I: He fent me alfo five Chefts of ex-
cellent Sweet-meats, and an hundred' Pieces of
Gold uncoin'd, not quite fo large as Moidores.
Z By
By the fame Fleet, my two Merchant Truflees
(hipp'd me i zoo Chcfts of Sugar, 800 Rolls of To-
bacco, and the reft of the whole Accomptin Gold.
I might well fay, now indeed, That the latter
.End of 'Job was better than the Beginning. It is
impoflible to exprcfs the Flutterings of my very
Heart, when I look'd over thele Letters, and ef-
pecially when I found all my Wealth about me; for
as the Brajil Ships come all in Fleets, the lame
Ships which brought my Letters, brought my
Goods j and the Efte&s were fare in the River be-
fore the Letters came to my Hand. In a word, I
turned pale, and grew fick} and rjad not the old
Man run and fetch'd me a Cordial, I believe the
fudden Surprize of Joy had overfet Nature, and I
had dy'd upon the Spot.
Nay after that, I continu'd very ill, and was fo
fome Hours, 'till a Phyfician being fent for, and
fomething of the real Caufe of my Illnefc being
known, he order'd me to be let Blood ; after
which, I had Relief, and grew well : But I verily
believe, if it had not been eas'd by a Vent given
in that manner to the Spirits, I mould have
I was now Mafter, all on a fudden, of above
j*ooo/. Sterling in Money, and had an Eftate, as
I might well call it, in the'Braftls, of above a
thoufand Pounds a Year, as fure as an Eftatc or
Lands in England: And, in a word, I was in a
Condition which I fcarce knew how to understand,
or how to compofe my felf, for the Enjoyment
of it.
The firft thing I did, was to recompense my
original Benefactor, my good old Captain, Wn°
had been firft charitable to me in my DiStreis,
kind to me in my Beginning, and honeft to roe »j
the End : I fliew'd him all that was fent me, J
told
told him, that next to the Providence of Heaven,
which difpofes all Things, it was owing to him j
and that it now lay on me to reward him, which
I would do a hundred fold: So I firft return'd to
him the hundred Moidores I had receiv'd of him,
then I fent for a Notary, and caufed him to draw
up a general Releafe or Discharge for the 470
Moidores, which he had acknowledg'd he ow'd
me in the fulleil and firmeft Manner poffible; af-
ter which, I caufed a Procuration to be drawn,
impowering him to be my Receiver of the annual
Profits of my Plantation, and appointing my Part-
ner to accompt to him, and make the Returns by
the ufual Fleets to him in my Name ; and aClaufe
in the End, being a Grant of 100 Moidores a
Year to him, during his Life, out of the Effects,
and f o Moidores a Year to his Son after him, for
h;s Life: And thus I requited my old Man.
I was now to confider which way to fleer my
Courfe next, and what to do with the Eftate that
Providence had thus put into my Hands , and in-
deed I had more Care upon my Head now, than
I had in my filent State of Life in the Ifland,
where I wanted nothing .but what I had, ajid
had nothing but what I wanted : Whereas I had
now a great Charge upon me, and my Bufinefs
was how to fccure it. I had ne'er a Cave now to
hide my Money in, or a Place where it might lye
without Lock or Key, 'till it grew mouldy and
tarnifh'd before any Body would meddle with it:
On the contrary, I knew not where to put it, or
who to trutt with it. My old Patron, the Cap-
tain, indeed was honeft, and that was the only
Refuge I had.
In the next Place, my Intereft in the Brafils
feem'd to lummon me thither, but now I could
not tell how to think of going thither, 'till I had
Z 2 fettled
fettled my Affairs, and left my Effe&s in fome fafe
Hands behind me. At firft I thought of my old
Friend the Widow, who I knew was honett, and
would be juft to me ; but then fhe was in Yean,
and but Poor, and for ought I knew, might be in
Debt j fo that in a word, I had no way but to
go back to England my felf, and take my Efftfts
With me.
It was fome Months however before I refolved
upon this j and therefore, as I had rewarded the
old Captain fully, and to his Satisfaction, who had
been my former"Benefactor, fo I began to think of
my poor Widow, whofe Husband had been ray
fir ft Benefactor, and fhe, while it was in her Pow-
er, my faithful Steward and Inftructor. So the firft
thing" I did, I got a Merchant in Lisbon to write
to his Correfpondent in London^ not only to pay a
Bill, but to go find her out, and carry her in Mo-
ney an hundred Pounds from me, and to talk with
her, and comfort her in her Poverty, by telling her
fhe fhould, if I liv'd, have a farther Supply: Ac
the fame time I fent my two Sifters in the Coun-
try, each of them an hundred Pounds, they being,
though not in Want,' yet not in very good Cir-
cumttances; one having been marry'd, and kit a
Widow i and the other having a Husband not fo
kind to her as he fhould be.
But among.all my Relations, or Acquaintances,
I could not yet pitch upon one, to whom I ourlt
commit the Grofs of my Stock, that I might go
away to the Brafils, and leave things fafe behind
me ; and this greatly perplex'd me.
I had once a Mind to have gone to the Brafils,
and have fettled my felf there } for I was, as it
were, naturaliz'd to the Place; but I had feJWg"
tie Scruple in my Mind about Religion, whicft
infenfibly drew me back, of which I fhall lay
J more
fin?
O
more prefently. However, it was not Religion
that kept me from going there for the prelehti
and as I had made no Scruple of being openly of
the Religion of the Country, all the while I was
among them, fo neither did I yet} only that now
and then having of late thought more of it, than
formerly) when I began to think of living and dying
among them, I began to regret my having protefs'd
my felf a Papift, and thought it might not be the
belt Religion to die with.
But, as I have faid, this was not the main thing that
kept me from going to the Brafils^ but that real-
ly I did not know with whom to leave my Eftects
behind me; fo 1 refolv'd at laft to go to England
with it, where, if I arrived, I concluded I fliould
make fome Acquaintance, or find fome Relations
that would be faithful to me; and accordingly I
prepar'd to go for England with all my Wealth.
In order to prepare things for my going Home, I
fit tt, the BrafilFleet being juft going away, refolved
to give Anfwers fuitable to the jutt and faithful Ac-
count of things I had from thence; and firft to the
Prior of St. Auguftim I wrote a Letter full of Thanks
for their jult .Dealings, and the Offer of the 871
Moidores, which was indifpofed of, which I de-
lif'd might be given foo to the Monailery, and
371 to the Poor, as the Prior fhould direct, defi-
ting the good Padres Prayers for me, and the like.
I wrote next a Letter of Thanks to my two
Truftees, with all the Acknowledment that fo
much Juftice and Honefty cali'd for; as for fend-
ing them any Prefent, they were far above having
any Occafion of it.
Laftly, I wrote to my Partner, acknowledging
his Ihduftry in the improving the Plantation, and
his Integrity in encreaiing the Stock of the Works,
giving him Inftru&ions for his future Govem-
Z 3 . ment
mcnt of my Part, according to the Powers I had
left with my old Patron, to whom I defir'd him to
fend whatever became due to me, 'till he mould
hear from me more particularly; afTuring him that
it was my Intention, not only to come to him, but
to fettle my felf there for the Remainder of my
Life : To this I added a very handfom Prefent of
fome Italian Silks for his Wife, and two Daughters,
for fuch the Captain's Son inform'd me he had;
with two Pieces of fine Englijb Broad-Cloath, the
beft I could get in Lisbon, five Pieces of black Bays,
and fome Flanders Lace of a good Value.
Having thus fettled my Affairs, fold my Cargoe,
and turn'd all my Effects into good Bills of Ex-
change; my next Difficulty was, which Waytogo
to England: I had been accuftom'd enough to the
Sea, and yet I had a ftrange Averfion to going to
England by Sea at that time; and though I could
give no Reafon for it, yet the Difficulty encrcas'd
upon me fo much, that though I had once fhipp'd
my Baggage, in order to go, yet I alter'd my Mind,
and that not once, but two or three times.
It is true, I hud been very unfortunate by Sea,
and this might be fome of the Reafons: But let
no Man flight the ftrong Impulfes of his own
Thoughts in Cafes of fuch Moment: Two of the
Ships which I had fingled out to go in, I mean,
more particularly fingled out than any other, that
is to fay, fo as in one of them to put my things on
Board, and in the other to have agreed with the
Captain} J fay, two of thefe Ships mifcarry'djW'z.
one was taken by the Algerines, and the other was
catt away on the Start near Torbay, and all the Peo-
ple drown'd except three; fo that in either of thole
Veflels I had been made miferablej and in which
moll, it was hard to fay.
• . V Having
Having been thus harafs'd in my Thoughts,- my
old Pilot, to whom I communicated every thing,
prefs'd me earneflly not to go by Sea, but either
to go by Land to the Groyne, and erofs over the
Bay of Bifcay to RocheU^ from whence it was but
an eafy and fafe Journey by Land to Paris, and fo
to Calais and Dover ; or to go up to Madrid, and
fo all the Way by Land thro' France.
In a word, 1 was fo prepoflcfs'd agninftmy going
by Sea at all, except from Calais to Dover, that
I refoiv'd to travel all the Way by Land 4 which
as I was not in Hafte, and did not value the
Charge, was by much the pleafanter Wayj and to
make it more fo, my old Captain brought an En-
gliJJo Gentleman, the Son of a Merchant in Lisbon^
who was willing to travel with me : After which,
we pick'd up two move Englijh Merchants alfo, and
two young Portuguefe Gentlemen, the laft going to
Paris only; fo that we were in all fix of us, and
five Servants} the two Merchants and the two
* Portuguefe^ contenting themfelves with one Ser-
vant between two, to fave the Charge; and as for
me, 1 got an Engtijh Sailor to travel with me as
a Servant, befides my Man Friday^ who was too
much a Stranger to be capable of fupplying the
Place of a Servant on the Road.
In this Manner I let out from Lisbon; and our
Company being all very well mounted and armed,
we made a little Troop, whereof they did me the
Honour to call me Captain, as well becaufe
I was the oldell Man, as becuufe I had two Ser-
vants, and indeed was the Original of the whole
Journey.
'As I have troubled you with none of my Sea-
Journals, fo I fhall trouble you now with none of
n)y Land-Journal: But fome Adventures that hap-
Z 4 pen'd
pen'd to us in this tedious and difficult Journey, I
muft not omit.
When we came to Madrid, we being all of us
Strangers to Spain, were willing to ftay fome time
to fee the Court of Spain, and to fee what was
worth obferving } but it being the latter Part of
the Summer, we.haften'd away, and fet out from
Madrid about the Middle of Ottober: But when we
came to the Edge of Navarre, we were alarm'd at
feveral Towns on the Way, with an Account, that
fo much Snow was fallen on the French Side of the
Mountains, that feveral Travellers were obliged
to come back to Pampeluna, after having attem-
pted at an extream Hazard to pafs on.
When we came to Pampeluna it felf,we found it
fo indeed} and to me that had been always ufed
to a hot Climate, and indeed to Countries where
we could fcarce bear any Cloaths on, the Cold was
infufferable -, nor indeed was it more painful than
it was furprizing, to come but ten Days before out
of the OldCaftile, where the Weather was not only
warm, but very hot; and immediately to feel a
Wind from the Pyrenean Mountains, To very keen,
fo feverely cold, as to be intolerable, and to en-
danger benumbing and perilhing of our Fingers
and Toes.
Poor Friday was really frighted when he faw the
Mountains all cover'd with Snow, and felt cold
Weather, which he had never feen or felt before
in his Life.
To mend the Matter, when we came to Paw
feluna, it continued fnowing with fo much Vio-
lence, and fo long, that the People faid. Winter
was come before 'its time, and the Roads which
were difficult before, were now quite impaiTable:
For in a Word, the Snow lay in fome Places too
thick for us to travel -t and being not hard frozen, as
•is the Cafe in Northern Countries: There was no
going without being in Danger of being bury'd
alive every Step. We Itaid no lefs than twenty
Days at Pampeluna ; when feeing the Winter com-
ing on, and no likelihood of its being better ; for
it was the fevereft Winter all over Europe that had
been known in the Memory of Man. I propos'd
that we fhould all go away to Fontarabia, and there
raking Shipping for Eourdcaux^ which was a very
little Voyage.
But while we were confiJering this, there came
in four French Gentlemen, who having been ftopp'd
on the French Side of the Paffes, as we were on
theSpaniJb, had found out a Guide, whotraverfing
the C»untry near t'ue Head of Langwdoc, had
brought them over the Mountains by fuch Ways,
that they were not much incommoded with the
Snow} and where they met with Snow in any
Quantity, they fa id it was frozen hard enough to
bear them and their Horfes.
We fent for this Guide, who told us, he would
undertake to carry us the fame Way with no Ha-
zard from the Snow, provided we were armed fuf-
ficiently to protett us from wild Beafts; for he
faid, upon thefe great Snows, it was frequent for
fome Wolves to fhow themfelves at the Foot of
the Mountains, being made ravenous for Want
of Food, the Ground being covered with Snow:
We told him, we were well enough prepar'd for
fuch Creatures as they were, if he would enfure
us from a Kind of two-legged Wolves, which we
were told we were in molt Danger from, efpeci-
ally on the Preach Side of the Mountains. •
He farisfy'd us there was no Danger of that kind
in the Way that we^were to goj lo we readily a-
greed to follow him, as did alib twelve other Gen-
tlemen,
tlemen, with their Servants, fome French, fome Spa,-
nijb, who, as I faid, had attempted to go, and
were oblig'd to come back again.
Accordingly, we all fet out from Pampelufia,\vith
our Guide, on the fifteenth of November; and in-
deed, I was furpriz'd, when inftead of going for-
ward, he came directly back with us, on the fame
Road that we came from Madrid, above twenty
Miles j when being pafs'd two Rivers, and come
into the plain Country, we found our felves in a
warm Climate again, where the Country was plea-
fant, and no Snow to be feenj but on a fuddcn,
turning to the Left, he approach'd the Mountains
another Way ? and though it is true, the Hills and
Precipices look'd dreadful, yet he made fo many
Tours, fuch.Meanders, and led us by fuch wind-
ing Ways, that we were infenfibly pafs'd the
Height of the Mountains, without being much
incumbred with the Snow; and all on a Hidden,
he fhew'd us the pleafant fruitful Provinces of Lan-
guedcc and Gafcoign, all green and flourishing; tho'
indeed it was at a great Diilance, and we had fome
rough Way to pafs yet.
.We were a little uneafy however, when we found
it fnow'd one whole Day, and a Night, fo fall,
that we could not travel j but he bid us be eafy,
we ihould foon be.patt it all: We found indeed,
that we began to defcend every Day, and to come
more North than before } and fo depending upou
our Guide, we went on.
It was about two Hours before Night, when
our Guide being fomething before us, and not juft
in Sight, out rufhed three monttrous Wolves, and
after them a Bear, out of a hollow Way, adjoyn-
jng to a thick Wood} two of the Wolves flew up-
on the Guide, and had he been half a Mile before
us, he had been deyour'd indeed, before we could
have
J
have help'd him : One of them faftned upon his
Horfe, and the other attack'd'the Man with that
Violence, that he had not Time, or not Prefence
of Mind enough to draw his Piftol, but hollow'd
and cry'd out to us moft luftily ; my Man Friday '
being next to trie, I bid him•ride up, and fee what
was the Matter; as foon as Friday came in Sight
of the Man, he hollow'd as loud as t'other, O Ma-
fter! O Mafter! But like a bold Fellow, rode di-
rectly up to the poor Man, and with his Piftol
fliot the Wolf that attack'd him into the Head.
It was happy for the poor Man, that it was my
Man Friday; for he having been us'd to that kind
of Creature in his Country, had no Fear upon
him } but went clofe up.to him, and fhot him as
above} whereas any of us, would have fir'd at a
farther diftance, and have perhaps either mifs'd the
Wolf, or endanger'd fhooting the Man.
But it was enough to have terrify'd a bolder
Man than I, and indeed it alarm'd all our Compa-
ny, when with the Noife of Friday's Piftol, we
heard on both Sides the difmalleft Howling of
Wolves, and the Noife redoubled by the Echo of
the Mountains, that it was to us as if there had
been a prodigious Multitude of them j and per-
haps indeed there was not fuch a few, as that we
had no Caufe of Apprehenfions.
However, as Friday had kill'd this Wolf, the o-
ther that had faftned upon the Horfe, left him im-
mediately, and fled ; having happily faftned upon
his Head, where the Bofles of the Bridle had ftuck
in his Teeth } fo that he had not done him much
Hurt: The Man indeed was moft Hurt; for the
raging Creature had bit him twice, once on the
Arm, and the other time a little above his Kneej
and he was juft as it were tumbling down by the
Diforder
Difordcr of his Horfe, when Friday came up and
fhot the Wolf.
It is eafy to fuppofe, that at the Noife of Fri-
day's Piftol, we all mended our Pace, and rid up as
faft as the Way (which was very difficult) would
give us leave, to fee what was the Matter; asfoon
as we came clear of the Trees, which blinded us
before, we faw clearly what had been the Cafe,
and how Friday had difengag'd the poor Guide;
though we did not prefently difcern what kind of
Creature it was he had kill'd.
But never was a Fight manag'd fo hardly, and
in fuch a furprizing Manner, as that which follow'd
between Friday and the Bear, which gave us all
(though at firft we were furpriz'd and afraid for
him) the greateft Diverfion imaginable : As the
Bear is a heavy,. clumfey Creature, and does not
gallop as the Wolf does, who is fwift, and light;
io he has two particular Qualities, which generally
are the Rule of his Actions} Firft, As to Men, who
arc not his proper Prey; I fay, not his properPrey;
bccaufe tho' 1 can't fay what exceflive Hunger might
do, which was now their Cafe, the Ground being all
cover'd with Snow; but as to Men, he does not u-
fually'attempt them, unlcfs they firft attack him;
On the contrary, if you meet him in the Woods, if
vou don't meddle with him, he won't meddle jvith
you; but then you mull take Care to be very civil
to him, and give him the Road; for he is a veiy
nice Gentleman, he won't go a Step out of his Way
for a Princej nay, if you are really afraid, your
beft way is to look another Way, and keep going
on; for fometimes if you ftop, and Hand flill, and
look fteadily at him, he takes it for an Affront; but
if you throw or tofs any Thing at him, and it hits
him, though it were but a bit of a Stick, as big «
your Finder, he takes it for an Affront, and fcts all
bis
his other Bufinefs afide to purfue his Revengej for
he will have Satisfaction in Point of Honour} that
is his firft Quality: The next is, That if he be
once affronted, he will never leave you, Night or
Day, till he has'his Revenge} but follows at a good
round rare, till he overtakes you.
My Man Friday had deliver'd our Guide, and
when we came up to him, he was helping him off
from his Horfej for the Man was both hurt and
frighted, and indeed the laft more than the firftj
when on the fudden, we fpy'd the Bear come out of
the Wood, and a vaft monftrous one it was, thebig-
geft by far that ever I faw. We were all a little fur-
priz'd when we faw him; but when Friday faw him,
it was eafy to fee Joy and Courage in the Fellow's
Countenance; O! O! O ! fays Friday, three times,
pointing to him ;O Mafter; You give me te Leave, me
jhakee te Hand with him; me make you good laugh.
I was furpriz'd to fee the Fellow fo pleas'd ; Tou
Fool you, fays I, he will eat you up: Eatee me up !
Eatee me up! fays Friday, twice over again j Me
eatee him up: Me make you good laugh: 1 ou all ftay
here, me Jboiv you good laugh; fo down he fits, and
gets his Boots off in a Moment, and put on a Pair
of Pumps, (as we call the flat Shoes they wear)
and which he had in his Pocket, gives my other
Servant his Horfe, and with his Gun away he flew
fwift like the Wind.
The Bear was walking foftly on, and offer'd to
meddle with no Body, till Friday coming pretty
near, calls to him, as if the Bear could understand
him} Hark ye, hark yet fays Friday^ me fpeakee ivit
you: We folltfw'd at a Diftancej for now being
come down on the Gafcoign fide of the Mountains,
we were entred.a vail great Foreft, where the
Country was plain, and pretty open, though many
Trees in it fcatter'd here and there.
/ v .Friday
Ffiday, who had as we fay, the Heels of the Bear,
came up with him quickly, and takes up a great
Stone, and throws at him, and hit him jufton the
Headj but did him no more harm, that if he had
thrown it agaflift a Wall; but it anfvver'd Friday's
End j for the Rogue was fo void of Fear, that he
did it purely to make the Bear follow him, and
fhew us fbme Laugh, as he call'd it.
As foon as the Bear felt the Stone, and faw him,
he turns about, and comes after him, taking Devi-
.lifh long Strides, and fhuffling along at a ftrange
Rate, fo as would have put a Horfe to a middling
Gallop; away runs Friday', and takes his Courfe, as
if he run towards us for Help } fo we all refolv'd to
fire at once upon the Bear, and deliver my Man;
though I was angry at him heartily, for bringing
the Bear back upon us, when he was going about
his own Bufinefs another.Way; and efpecially I
was angry that he hadturn'd the Bear upon us, and
then run away } and I call'd out, Tou Dog, faid I, /;
this your making us laugh ? Come away, and take your
Hor/Cy that we may /hoot the Creature ; he hears me,
and cries out, No/hoot^ no fioot, ftand ftill^ you get
much Laugh. And as the nimble Creature run two
Foot for the Bead's one, he turn'd on a fudden, on
one fide of us, and feeing a great Oak-Tree fit for
his Purpofe, he beckon'd to us to follow, and
doubling his Pace, he gets nimbly up the Tree,
laying his Gun down upon the Ground, at about
five or fix Yards from the Bottom of the Tree.
The Bear foon came to the Tree, and we fol-
low'd at a Diftance; the firft Thing he did, he
ftopp'd at theGun, fmelt to it, but let it lye, and
up he fcrambles into the Tree, climbing like a Cat,
though fo monftroufly heavy : I was amaz'd at the
Folly, as I thought it, of my Man, and could nor
for my Life fee any Thing to laugh at yet, till «*-
ing
ing the Bear get up the Tree, we all rod nearer
to him.
W hen we came to the Tree, there was Friday
got out to the fmall End of a large Limb of the
Tree, and the Bear got about halfway to him j
as foon as the Bear got out to that part where the
Limb of the Tree was weaker, /&, fays he to us,
now you fee me teachee the Bear dance ; fo he falls a
jumping and fhaking the Bough, at which the Bear
began to totter, bue flood ftill, and began to look
behind him, to fee how he fhould get back; then
indeed we did laugh heartily : But Friday had not
done with him by a great deal j when he fees him
ftand ftill, he calls out to him again, as if he had
fuppos'd the Bear could fpeak Englifi ; IVhat^ you
no come farther ? Pray you come farther ; fo he left
jumping and {baking the Trees} and the Bear, juft
as if he had underftood what 'he faid, did come a
little farther, then he fell a jumping again, and the
Bear flopp'd again.
We thought now was a good time to knock him
on the Head, and I call'd to Friday to ftand ftill,
and we would (hoot the Bearj but he cry'd out
earnettly, O pray ! O fray ! No floot^ me float by
and ihen-, he would have faid, by and by. However,
to fhorten the Story, Friday danc'd fo much, and
the Bear flood fo ticklifh, that we had laughing
enough indeed, but ftill could not imagine what
the Fellow would doj for firft we thought he de-
pended upon fhaking the Bear offj and we found
the Bear was too cunning for that. too; for'he
would not go out far enough to be thrown down,
but clings fatt with his great broad Claws and
Feet, fo that we could not imagine what would
be the End of it, and where the Jeft would be at
laft.
But

But Friday put us out of doubt quickly; for
feeing the Bear cling faft to the Bough, and that
he would not be perl waded to come any farther}
Wel^ well, fays Friday, you no come farther, me go,
me go ; you no come to me, me go come to you ; and
upon this, he goes out to the fmalleft End of the
Bough, where it would bend with his Weight, and
gently let himfelf down by it, Hiding down the
Bough, till he came near enough to jump down
on his Feet, and away he run to his Gun, takes it
up, and {lands ftill.
Well, laid I to him, Friday, What will you do
now ? Why don't you fhoot him ? No /hoot, fays
Friday, no yet, me Jhoot now, me no kill; me ftay,
give you one more laugh; and indeed fo he did, as you
will fee prefently ; tor when the Bear fee his Ene-
my gone, he comes back from the Bough where he
Hood , but did it mighty leifurely, looking behind
him every Step, and coming backward till he got
into the Body of the Tree } then with the fame
hinder End foremort, he come down the Tree,
grafping it with his Claws, and moving one Foot
at a time, very leifurely } at this Juncture, and juft
before he could fet his hind Feet upon the Ground,
Friday ftcpt up clofe to him, clapt the Muzzel of
his Piece into his Ear, and {hot him dead as a
Stone.
Then the Rogue turn'd about, to fee if we did
not laugh, and when he faw we were pleas'd by
our Looks, he falls a laughing himfelf very loudj
fo we kill Bear in my Country, fays Friday; fo you
kill them, fays I, why you have no Guns: No,
fays he, no Gun, but /boot, great much long Arrow-
This was indeed a good Diverfion to us j but
we were ftill in a wild Place, and our Guide very
much hurt, and what to dp we.hardly knew} the
Howline of Wolves run much in my Head j and in-
deed,
deed, except the Noife I once heard on the Shore
of Africa, of which I have faid fomething already,
I never heard any thing that filled me with fo much
Horrour.
Thefe things, and the Approach of Night, cal-
led us off, or elfe, as Friday would have had us,
we fhould certainly have taken the Skin of this
monltrous Creature off, which was worth faving j
but we had three Leagues to go, and our Guide
haflen'd us, fo we left him, and went forward on
our Journey.
The Ground was ftill coverM with Snow, tho'
not fo deep and dangerous as on.the Mountains,
and the ravenous Creatures, as we heard arter-^
wards, were come down into the Foreft and plain
Country, prefs'd by Hunger to feck for Food; and
had done a great deal of Mifchief in the Villages,
where they furpriz'd the Country People, kill'd a
Preat many of their Sheep and Horfes, and Tome
eople too.
We had one dangerous Place to pafs, which
our Guide told us, if there were any more Wolves
in the Country, we fhould find them there; and
this was in a fmall Plain, lurrounded with Woods
on every Side, and a long narrow Defile or Lane,
which we we're to pafs to get through the Wood,
and then we fhould come to the Village where we
were to lodge.
It was within half an Hour of Sun-fet when we
entred the firft Woodi and a little after Sun-fet,
•when we came into the Plain, we met with no-
thing in the firlt Wood, except that in a little
Plain within the Wood, which was not above two
Furlongs over, we (aw five great Wolves crofs the
Road, full Speed one after another, as if they had
been in Chafe of fome Prey, and had it in View?,
A a they
they took no Notice of us, and were gone, and
out of our Sight in a few Moments.
,Upon this our Guide, who b,y the Way was a
wretched faint-hearted Fellow, bid us keep in a
ready Pofture -, for he believed there were more
Wolves a corning.
We kept our Arms ready,and our Eyesaboutus,
but we faw no more Wolves, 'till we came thro'
that Wood, which was near half a League, and en-
trcd the Plain; as foon as we came into the Plain,
we had Occaiion enough to look about us: The
firft Obj'cVwe met with, was a dead Horfe;
that is to fay, a poor Horfe which the Wolves
had kill'd, and at leaft a Dozen of them at Work;
ve could not fay eating of him, but picking of
his Rones rather; for they had eaten up all the
Flefh before.
We did not think fit to difturb them at their
Fealt, neither did they take much Notice of
us: Friday would have* let fly at them, but I
would not fuffer him by any Means j for I found
we were like to have more Bufinefs upon our
Hands than we were aware of. We were not
fone half over the Plain, but we began to hear the
Volves houl in the Wood on our Left, in a fright-
ful Manner, and prefently after we faw about a
hundred coming on diredly towards us, all in a
Bod'y, arid mot t of them in a Line, as regularly as
an Army drawn up by experienc'd Officers. I
ifcarce knew in what Manner to receive theml
but found to draw our felves in a clofe Line was
the only Way: fo we form'd in a Moment: But
that we might not have too much Interval, I or-
der'd, that only every other Man fhould fire5 an"
thac the others who had not fird fhould ftand rea-
dy to give them a fecond Volley immediately, it
they continued to advance upon us, and that then
. thofe
thofe who had fir'd at firft, fhould not pretend to
load their Fufees again, but ftand ready with every
one a Piftol; for we were all arm'd with a Fufee,
and a Pair of Piftols each Man } fo we were by
this Method able to fire fix Volleys, half of us at
a Time j however, at prefent we had no Ncceffi-
ty} for upon firing the firft Volley, the Enemy
made a full Stop, being terrify'd as well with the
Noife, as with the Fire; four of them being {hot
into the-Hea'd, dropp'd, feveral others were ^wound-
ed, and went bleeding off, as we could fee by the
Snow: I found they Itopp'd, but did not immedi-
ately retreat; whereupon remembring that I had
been told, that the fierceft Creatures were terri-
fy'd at the Voice of a Man, I caus'd all our Com-
pany to hollow as loud as we could; and I found
the Notion not altogether miftaken ; for upon our
Shout, they began to retire, and turn about; then
I order'd a fecond Volley to be fir'd, in their Rear,
which put them to the Gallop, and away they
went to the Woods.
This gave us leifure to charge our Pieces again,
and that we might lofenoTime, we kept going}
but we had but little more than loaded our Fufees,
and put our felves into a Readinefs, when we heard
a terrible Noife in the fame Wood, on our Left,
only that it was farther onward the fame Way we
were to go.
The Night was coming on, and the Light be-
fan to be dusky, which made it worfe on our Side j
ut the Noife encreafing, we could eafily perceive
that it was the howling and yelling of thofe hel-
iifh Creatures; and on a fudden, we perceiv'd i or
5 Troops of Wolves, one on our Left, one behind us,
and one on our Front ; fo that we feem'd to be
furrounded with 'em; however, as they did not
fall upon us, we kept our Way forward, as faft as
£ A a 2 we
we could make our Hmks go, which the Way be-
ing very rough, was only a good large Tr-.t 5 and
in this Manuer we rame in View o; the Entrance
of a Wood, through which we were to pals, at
the farther fide of the Plain ; but we were grat-
ly furpriz'd, when coming nearer the L::ne, or
Pafs, we few a confus'd Number ot YV< Ives itand-
ing juft at the Entrance.
On a fudden, at another opening of the Wood,
we heard the Noife of a Gun; and looking that
Way, out rufh'J a Hor.'e, with a Saddk, and a
Bridle on him, flying like the Wind, and (ixtcen
or fcvcntcen Wolves after hiir, full Speed; indeed,
the Horfe had the Heels 01 them ; but as we fup-
pos'd that he could not hold it at that rate, we
doubted'not but they would get up with him at
laft, and no queftion but they did.
But here we had a moft horrible Sight; for ri-
ding up to the Entrance where the Horie came out,
we found the Carcafs of another Horfe, and oi two
Men, devour'd by the ravenous Creatures, and one
of the Men was no doubt the fame who we heard
fir'd the Gun; for there lay a Gun jult by him nr'fl
off; but as to the Man, his Head, and the upper
Part of his Body, was eaten up.
This fill'd us with Horrour, and we knew not
what Courfe to tike, but the Creatures refoK'd us
foon ; for they gather'd about us prefently, in hopes
of Prey ; and I verily believe there were three hun-
dred of them : It happen'd very much to our Ad-
vantage, that at the Entrance into the Wood, but
a little Way from it, there lay fome large Timber
Trees, which had been cut down the Summer be-
fore, and I fuppofe lay there for Carriage; I drew
my little Troop in among thofe Trees, and placing
our felves in a Line, behind one long Tree, I ad-
vis'd them all to light, and keeping that Tree be-
fore us, for a Breaft-Work, to ftand in a Trian-
gle, or three Fronts, enclofmg our Horfes in the
Center.
We did fo, and it was well we did j for never
was a more furious Charge than the Creatures
made upon us in the Place; they came on us with
a growling kind of aNoife and mounted the Piece
of Timber, (which as Ifaid, was our Breatt-Work)
as if they were only rulhtng upon their Prey} and
this Fury of theirs, it fcems, was principally occa-
fion'd by their feeing our Horfes b•eliind us, which
was the Prey they aim'd at: I order'd our Men to
fire as before, every other Man; and they took
their Aim fo fure, that indeed they kill'd fcveral of
the Wolves at the firft Volley} but there was a
NecdTity to keep a continual Firing; for they
came on like Devils, thofe behind pufhing on
thofe before.
When we had fir'd our fecond Volley of ourFu-
fees, we thought they ftopp'd a little, and I hop'd
they would have gone offj but it was but a Mo-
ment; for others came forward again; fo we fir'd
two Volleys of our Pittols, and 1 believe in thefe
four Firings, we had kill'd feventeen or eighteen of
them, and lum'd twice as many; yet they came on
again.
I was loath to fpend our laft Shot too haftily; fb
I call'd my Servant, not my Man Friday^ for he was
better employ'dj for with the greateft. Dexterity
imaginable, he had charg'd my Fufee", and his
own, while we were engag'd; but as I faid, I call'd
my other Man, and giving him a Horn of Powder,
I bad him lay a Train, all along the Piece of Tim-
ber, and let it be a large Train; he did fo, and had,
but jult Time to get away, when the Wolves came
up ro it, and fome were.got up upon it; when
I lhapping an uncharged Piltol, dole to the Pow-
A a 3 der,
Icr, fet it on fire j thofe that were upon the Tim-
>cr wcrcfcorcht with it, and fix or fevcnof them
'ell, or rather jump'd in among us, with the Force
ind Fright of the Fire, we difpatch'd thefe in
in Inftant, and the reft were fo frighted with
:hc Light, which the Nighr, for it was now very
near Dark, made more terrible, that they drew
jack a Ifttle.
Upon which I order'd our laft Piftol to be fir'd
DfFin one Volley, and after that we gave a Shout;
upon this, the Wolves turn'd Tail, and we fally'd
immediately upon near twenty lame Ones, who
we found ftruggling on the Ground, and tell a cut-
ting them with our Swords, which anfwer'd our
Expectation ; for the Crying and Howling they
made, was better underftood by their Fellows, fo
that they all fled and left us.
We had, firil and laft, kilPd about three Score
of them} and had it been Day-Light, we had
kill'd many more : The Field of Battle being thus
clear'd, we made forward again; for we had ftill
near a League to go. We heard the ravenous Crea-
tures houl and yell in the Woods as we went, fe-
veral times; and fometimes we fancy'd we law
fome of them, but the Snow dazling our Eyes,
we were not certain; fo in about an Hour more,
we came to the Town, where we were to lodge,
which we found m a terrible Fright, and all in
Arms} for it feems, that the Night before, the
Wolves and fome Bears had broke into the ViUage
in the Night, and put them in a terrible Fright,
and they were oblig'd to keep Guard Night and
Day, but elpecially in the Night, to prelerve their
Cattle, and indeed their People.
The next Morning our Guide was fo ill, and his
Limbs fwell'd with the rankling of his two Wounds,

I
take a new Guide there, and go toThokufe^ where
we found a warm Climate, a fruitful pleafant Couai
try, and no SnoWj no Wolves, or any Tilling lijtfi
them; but when we told our Story at Tholoufc, they?*
told us it was nothing but what was ordinary in the
great Foreft at the Foot of the Mountains, efpeci-
ally when the Snow lay on the Ground : But they
enquir'd much what kind of a Guide we had got-
ten, that would venture to bring us that Way in
fuch a fevere Seafon; and told us, it was very much
we were not all devour'd. When we told rhem how
we plac'd our felves, and the Horfes in the Middle,
theyblam'd us exceedingly, and told us it was fifty
to one but we had been all deftroy'd; for it was the
Sight of the Horfes which made the Wolves fo fu-
rious, feeing their Prey; and that at other Times
they are really afraid of a Gun ; but the being ex.-
ceffive hungry, and raging on that Account, the
Eagernefs to come at the Horfes had made them
fenilefs of Danger; and that if we had not by the
continu'd Fire, and at laft by the Stratagem of the
Train of Powder, mafter'd them, it had been gre*t
Odds but that we had been torn to Pieces } where-
as had we been content to have fat ftill on Horfe-
back, and fir'd as Horfemen, they would not have
taken the Horfes for fo much their own, when Men
were on their Backs, as otherwife ; and withal
they told us, that at laft, if we had ftood all toge-
ther, and left our Horfes, they would have been fo
eager to have devour'd them, that we might have
come off fafe, efpecially having our Fire Arms in
our Hands, and being fo many in Number.
For my Part, 1 was never fo fenfibie of Danger
in my Life j for feeing above three hundred Devils
come roaring and open-mouth'd to devour us, and
having nothing to fhelter us, or retreat to, 1 gave

: fafe about me, the Bills of Exchange which I
i^ht with me having been very currently paid.
/fv principal Guide, and Privy Counfellor, was
good ancient Widow, who in Gratitude for the
ney I had fent her, thought no Pains too much,
xu e too great, to employ for me} 'and I trutted
fo entirely with every Thing, that I was per-
ly cafy as to the Security of my Effects; and in-
j, I was very happy from my Beginning, and
i to the End, in the unlpotted Integrity of this
d Gentlewoman.

I refolv'd to ftay at Home, and if I could find
Means for it, to difpoie of my Plantation.
To this Purpofe I wrote to my old Friend at
Lisbnn, who in Return gave me Notice, that he
could e.ifily difpofe of it there: But that if I
thought fit to give him Leave to offer it in my
Name to the two Merchants, the Survivors of my
Truliees, who liv'd in the Urafils, who murt fully
underfland the Value of it, who liv'd juftupon the
Spot, and who I knew were very rich, fo that he
belicv'd they would be fon i of buying it$ he did
rot doubt, but I fhould make 4 or j-ooo Pieces of
Eight, the more of it.
Accordingly I agreed, gave him Order to offer
it to them, and he did fo^f and in about 8 Months
more, the Ship being then icturn'd, he fent me an
Account, that they had accepted the Offer, and
hud remitted 33000 Pieces of Eight, to a Cor-
relpondent of theirs at Lisbon, to pay for it.
In Return, 1 fign'd the Instrument of Sale in the
Form which they fent from Lisbon^ and fent it to
my old Man, who fent me Bills of Exchange for
328000 Pieces ot Eight to me, for the Eftate j re-
Icrving the Payment of 100 Moidores a Year to
him, the old Man, during his Life, and fo Moi-
dores afterwards to his Son for his Life, which I
had promifed them, which the Plantation was to
make good as a Rent-Charge. And thus I have
given the firft Part of a Life of Fortune and Ad-
venture, a Life of Providence's Checquet-Work,
and of a Variety which the World will feldom be
able to (hew the like of: Beginning foolifhly, but
clofing much more happily than any Part of it ever
gave me Leave fo much as to hope for.
Any one would think, that in this State of com-
plicated good Fortune, I was pall running any
more Hazards} and fo indeed I had been, if other
Cir-
:um fiances had concurr'd, but I was inur'd to
andringLife, had no Family, not many Rela-
is, flor however Rich had I contracted much Ac-
intance} and though 1 had fold my Ettate in
Bra/Us, yet I could not keep the Country out
ny Head, and had a great Mind to be upon
Wing again, efpecially I could not refift the
>ng Inclination I had to fee my Ifhnd, and to
»w if'the poor Spaniards were in Being there,
how the Rogues I left there had ufed them.
Ay true Friend, the Widow, earneftly difwa-
me frorrj it, and fo fur prevaiFd with me, that
almoft feven Years {he prevented my running
sad i during whichfctime, I took my two
phews, the Children of one of my Brothers,
> my Care : The eldelt having fomething of
own, I bred up as a Gentleman, and gave
i a Settlement of fome Addition to his Elhte,
:r my Deceafej the other I put out to a Cap-
i of a Ship} and after five Years, finding
i a fenfible bold enterprizing young Fellow, I
him into a good Ship, and fent him to Sea:
i this young Fellow afterwards drew me in, as
as I was, to farther Adventures my felf.
n the mean time, 1 in part fettled my felf here:
firft of all I marry'd, and that not either to my
advantage or Diflatisfa&ion, and had three
ildren, two Sons and one Daughter : But my
fe dying, and my Nephew coming Home with
id Succefs from a Voyage to Spain, my Inclina-
i to go abroad, and his Importunity prevailed
engag'd me to go in his Ship, as a private Trader,

into, as full of Variety and wonderful Accidents,
as my own Part, particularly alfo as to their Battles
with the Carribeans, who landed feveral times
upon the Ifland, and as to the Improvement they
made upon the Ifland ic felf, and how five of
them made an Attempt upon the main Land,
and brought away eleven Men and five Women
Prifoners, by which, at my coming, I found about
twenty young Children on the Ifland.
Here I ftay'd about zo Days, left them Sup-
plies of all neceflary things, and particularly of
Arms, Powder, Shot, Cloaths, Tools, and two
Workmen, which I brought from England with
me, viz. a Carpenter and a Smith.
Befides this, I fhard the Ifland into Parts with
'em, referv'd to my felf the Property of the whole,
but gave them fuch Parts respectively as they a-
greed on} and having fettled all things with them,
and engaged them not to leave the Place, I left
them there.
From thence I touch'd at the Braftls, from whence
I fent a Bark, which 1 bought there, with more
People to the Ifland, and in it, befides other Sup-
plies, I fent feven Women, being fuch as I found
proper for Service, or for Wives to fuch as would
take them: As to the Englijh Men, I promis'd them
to fend them fome Women from England^ with a
good Cargoe of Ncceflaries, if they would apply
themfclves to Planting, which I afterwards per-
form'd. And the Fellows prov'd very honeft
and diligent after they were mafter'd, and had
their Properties fee apart for them. I fent them

alfo from the Brafih five Cows, three of them be-
ing big with Calf, fome Sheep, and fome Hogs,
•which, when I came again, were confiderably en-
creas'd.
But all thefe things, with an Account how 300
Caribbecs came and invaded them, and ruin'd their
Plantations, and how they fought with that whole

three of them kill'd ; but at laft a Storm deiiroying
their Enemies Cannoes, they famifh'd or deltrcy'd
almoiT all the reft, and renew'd and recover'd the
Pofleffion of their Plantation, and flill liv'd upon
the Ifland.
All thefe things, with fome very furprizing In-
cidents m fome new Adventures of my own, for ten
Years more, I may perhaps give a farther Account
of hererafter.

ROBINSON CRUSOE,
 Was born in the Year irfjz, in the
City of York, of a good Family, tho'
not of that Country, my Father be-
ing a Foreigner otBremau, who fettled
firft at Hull: He got a good Eftate
by Merchandize, and leaving off his
Trade, lifced afterward at Tork, from whence he had
married my Mother, whofe Relations were*named
Robinfon, a very good. Family in that Country, and
from whom I was call'd Robinfon Kreutz,naer; but by
the ufual Corruption of Words in England, we are
now call'd, nay we call our felve$, and write our
Namet>a/o?,and To myCompanions always eall'd me;
B I had
or too far below me; that mine was the middle
State, or what might be called the upper Station
of Low Life, which he had found by long Experience
was the beft State in the World, the moft fuited to
human Happinefs, not expofedto the Miferiesand
Hardfhips, the Labour and Sufferings of the me-
chanick Part of Mankind, and not embarafs'd with
the Pride, Luxury, Ambition and Envy of the up-
per Part of Mankind* He told me, I might judge
of the Happinefs of this State, by this one thing,
viz,. That this was the State of Life which all
other People envied; that Kings have frequently la-
mented the miferable Confequences of being born
to great Things, and wifh they had been placed
in the Middle of the two Ejftremes, between the
Mean and the Great; that the wife Man gave his
Teftimony to this as the juft Standard of true Fe-
licity, when he prayed to have neither Poverty or
Riches.
He bid me obferve it, and I fhould always findj
that the Calamities of Life were fhared among the
upper and lower Part of Mankind ; but that the
middle Station had the feweft Difafters, and was
not expos'd to fo many Viciffitudes as the higher or
lower Part of Mankind ; nay, they were not fubje*
cted to fo many Diftempers and Uneafinefles either
of Body or Mind, as thofe were, who by vicious
Living, Luxury and Extravagancies on one Hand,
or by hard Labour, want of Neceflaries, and mean
or infufficient Diet on the other Hand, bring Di-
ftempers upon themfelves by the natural Confequen*
ces of their Way of Living ; That the middle Sta-
tion of Life was calculated for all kind of Virtues
and all kind of Enjoyments ; that Peace and Plen-
ty were the Hand-maids of a middle Fortune;
tliat Temperance, Moderation, Quietnefs,Health,
B a Society,
vail, his young Defires prompting him to run into
the Army where he was kill 'd ; and tho' he fai^
he would not ceafe to pray for me, yet he wouP
venture to fay to me, that if I did take this foolifh
Step, God would not blefs me, and I would have
Le.ifure heteafcer to reflect upon having neglected
his Counfel when there might be none to aflift in
my Recovery.
I obferved in this laft Part of. his .Difcourfe,
which was truly Prophetick, tho' I fuppofe my Fa-
ther did not know it to be fo himfelr'; I fay, I ob-
ferved the Tears run down his Face very plentiful-
ly, and efpedally when he fpokc of my Brother
who was kill'd f^and that when he fpok,e of my ha-
ving Leifure to repent, and none to aflift me, he
was fo mov'd, that he broke oft the Difcourfe, and
told me, his Heart was fo full, he could fay no
more to me.
I was lincerely affeded with this Difcourfe, as
indeed who could be otherwife ? and I refolv'd not
to think of going Abroad any more, but to fettle
at Home according to my Father's Defire. But
alas! a few Days wore it all off; and in fhort, to
prevent any of my Father's farther Importunities,
in a few Weeks after, I refolv'd to run quite away
from him. However, I did not act fo haftily neither
as my firft Heat of Refolution prompted, but I took
my Mother, at a time when I thought her a little
pleaferiter than ordinary, and told her, that my
Thoughts were fo entirely bent upon feeing the
World, that I fhould never fettle to any thing with
Rclblution enough to go through with it, and my
Father had better give me his Confent than force
me to go without it; that I was now Eighteen
Years old, which was too ]ate to go Apprentice to
a Trade, or Clerk to an Attorney ; that I was fure,
if I did, I mould never ferve out my Time, and I
B 3 fhould
don, in his Father's Ship, and prompting me to go
with them, with the common Allurement of Seafa-
ring Men, viz* That it fhould coft me nothing for
my Paffage, I confulted neither Father or Mother
any more, rior fo much as fent them Word of it; but
leaving them to hear of it as they might, without
asking God's Bleffing, or my Father's, without any
Confideration of Circumftances or Confequences,
and in an ill Hour, God knows, on the firft of Sep-
tember 1651, I went on board a Ship bound for Lon-
don ; never any young Adventurer's Misfortunes, I
believe, began fooner, or continued longer than mine.
The Ship was no fooner gotten out of the Humber,
but the Wind began to blow, and the Winds to rife
in a moft frightful manner; and as I had never
been at Sea before, I was moft inexpreffible fick in
Body, and terrify'd in my Mind: I began now fe-
rioully to retted: upon what I had done, and how
juftly I was overtaken by the Judgment of Heaven
for my wicked leaving my Father's Houfe, and a-
bandoning my Duty; all the good Counfel of my
Parents, my Father's Tears and my Mother's En-
treaties came now frefh into my Mind, and my
Confcience, which was not yet come to the Pitch
of Hardnefs to which it has been fince, reproach'd
me with the Contempt of Advice, and the Breach
of my Duty to God and my Father.
All this while the Storm encreas'd, and the Sea,
which I had never been upon before, went very high,
tho' nothing like what I have feen many times
fince; no, nor like what I faw a few Days after .•
But it was enough to affect me then, who was but
a young Sailor, and had never known any thing of
the Matter. I expeded every Wave would have
fwallowed us up, and that every time the Ship fell
down, as I thought, in the Trough or Hollow
84' of
Wind ? A Capful! d'you call it ? faid I, 'twas a terri-
ble Storm : A Storm, you Fool you, replies he, do you
catt that a Storm, -why it was nothing at all; give us but
a good Ship and Sea-room, and we think nothing of fucb
a. Squal of Wind as that; but iour e Init.afrejh Water
Saillor, Bob; come let «.r make a Bowl of Punch and
we II forget all that; d'ye fee what charming Weather 'tis
now ? To make fhort this fad Part of my Story,
we went the old way of all Sailors, the Punch" was
made, and I was made drunk with it, and in that
one Night's Wickednefs I drowned all. my Repen-
tance, all my Reflections upon my paft Conduct,
and all my Refolutions for my future. In a word,
as the Sea was returned to its Smoothnefs of Sur-
face and fettled Calmnefs by the Abatement of that
Storm, fo the Hurry of my Thoughts being over,
my Fears and Apprehenfions of being fwallow'd up
by the Sea being rorgotten, and the Current of my
former Defires return'd, I entirely forgot the Vows
and Promife.s that I made in my Diftrcfs. I found
indeed fome Intervals of Reflection, and theierious
Thoughts did, as it were, endeavour to return a*
gain fometimes, but I Ihook them off, and rouz'd
my felf from them as it were from a Diilemper,
and applying my felf to Drinking and Company,
foon matter'd the Return of thofe Fits, for fo I
call'd them, and I had in five or fix Days got as
compleata Victory over Confcience as any young
Fellow that refolv'd not to be troubled with it,
could deiire: But I was to have another Trial for
it ftiil; and Providence, as in fuch Cafes generally
it does, refolv'd to leave me entirely without Excufe.
For if I would not take this for a Deliverance, the
next was to be fuch a one as the worft and moft
harden'd Wretch among us would tonfefs both the
Danger and the Mercy.
The
 Hurries, I was ftupid, lying {till in my Cabbin,
which was in the Steerage, and cannot defcribe my
Temper.. I could ill re-aflume the firft Penitence
which I had fo apparently trampled upon, and har-
den'd my felf againft : I thought the Bittternefs of
Death had been pail, and that this would be no-
think too like the firft. But when the Mafter him-
felf came by me, as I faid juft now, and faid we
fhould be all loft, I was dreadfully frighted : I got
up out of my Cabbin, and look'dout; but fucha
difinal Sight I never faw: The Sea went Mountains
high, and broke upon us every three or four Mi-
nutes : When I could look about, I could fee no-
thing but Diilrefs round us : Two Ships that rid
near us, we found, had cut their Mails by the
Board, being deep loaden; and our Men cry d out,
that a Ship which rid about a Mile a-Head of us
was foundered. Two more Ships being driven from
their Anchors, were run out of the Roads to Sea,
at all Adventures, and that with not a Maft {land-
ing. The light Ships fared the beft, as not fo much
labouring in the Sea ; but two or three of them
drove, and came clofe by us, running away with
only their Sprit-fail out before the Wind.
Towards Evening the Mate and Boatfwain
begg'd the Mafter of our Ship to let them cut a-
way the Fore-matt, which he was very unwilling
to.. But the Boatfwain protefting to him, that if he
did not, the Ship would founder, he confented j
and when they had cut away the Fore-maft, the
Main-maft flood fo loofe, and fhook the Ship fo
much, they were obliged to cut her away alfo, and
make a clear Deck.
Any one may judge what a Condition I muft be
in at all this, who was but a young Sailor, and
who had been in fuch a Fright before at but a lit-
tle. But if I can exprefs at this Diftance the
Thoughts
prized, that I fell down in a Swoon. As thi*
was a time when every Body had'his own Life t6
think of, no Body minded me, or what was become
of me; but another Man ftept up to the Pump, and
thruftingme afide with his Foot, let me lye, think-
ing I had been Dead ; and it was a great while
before I came to my felf.
We work'd on, but the Water encreafing in the
Hold, it was apparent that the Ship would founder,
and cho' the Storm began to abate a little, yet as
it was not poffible fhe could fwim till we might run
into a Port, fo the Mafter continued firing Guns for
Help ; and a light Ship who had rid it out juft a
Head of us, ventured a Boat out to help us. It was
with the utmoft hazard the Boat came near us, but
it was impoffible for us to get on Board, or for the
Boat to Me near the Ship Side, till at laft the Men
rowing very heartily, and venturing their Lives to
fave ours, our Men catt them a Rope over the Stern
with a Buoy to it, and then vered it out a great
Length, which they after great Labour and Hazard
took hold of, and we haul'd them clofe under our
Stern and got all into their Boat. It was to no
Purpofe for them or us after we were in the Boat to
think of reaching to their own Ship, fo all agreed
to let her drive, and only to pull her in towards
Shore as much as we could, and our Mafter pro-
mifed them, That if the Boat was ftav'd upon
Shore he would make it good to their Mafter, fo
partly rowing and partly driving, our Boat went a-
way to the Norward, (leaping towards the Shore
almoft as far as Wmterton-Ncfs.
We were not much more than a quarter of an
Hour out of our Ship but we faw her.fink, and
then I underftood for the firft time what was meant
by a Ship foundering in the Sea ; I muft acknow-
ledge
 no Power to do it. I know not what to call this, nor
will I urge, that it is a fecret over-ruling Decree
that hurries us on to be the Inftruments of our own
Definition, even tho' it be before us, and that we
pufh upon it with our Eyes open. Certainly no-
thing but fome luch decreed unavoidable Mifery
attending, and which it was impoffible for me to
efcape, could have pufh'd me forward againft the
calm Reafonings and Perfwafions of my moft re-
tired Thoughts, and againft two fuch vifible In-
ftructions as I had met with in my firft Attempt.
My Comrade, who had help'd to harden me be-
fore, and who was the Mafter's Son, was now lefs
forward than I; the firft time he fpoke to me after
we were at Yarmouth, which was not till two or
three Days, for we were feparated in the Town
to feveral Quarters; I fay, the firft time he faw me,
it appear'd his Tone was alter'd, and looking very
melancholy, and fluking his Head, ask'd me how
I did, and telling his Father who I was, and how
I had come this Voyage only for a Tryal, in order
to go farther abroad; his Father turning to me
with a very grave and concern'd Tone, Young Man,
fays he, you ought never to go to Sea any more, you ought
to take this for a plain and vifible "Token that you are
not to be a Seafaring Man. Why, Sir, faid I, will you
go to Sea no more ? 'That is another Cafe, faid he,
it is my Calling, and therefore my Duty; but as you made
this Voyage for a Tryal, you fee what a Tafte Heaven has
given you of what you are to expett if you perfift ; perhaps
this is all befallen us on your Account, like Jonah in the
Ship of Tarftufh. Pray, continues he, what are you*
and on what Account did you go t« Sea ? Upon that I
told him fome of my Story ; at the End of which he
burft out with a ftrange kind of Palfion, What had
I done, fays he, that fuch an unhappy Wretch fhould
come into my Ship j . I would not fet my Foot in
the
the Remembrance of the Diftrefs I had been in
wore off; and as that abated, the little Motion I
had in my Defires to a Return wore off with it,
till at laft I quite laid afide the Thoughts of it,
and look'd out for a Voyage.
That evil Influence which carried me firir. away
from my Father's Houfe, that harried me into the
wild and indigefted Notion of raifmg my Fortune ;
and that impreft thofe Conceits fo forcibly upon
me, as to make me deaf to a;] good Advice, and
to the Entreaties and even the Command of my Fa-
ther: I fay the fame Influence, whatever it wast
prefented the moft unfortunate of all Enterprizes
to my View; and I went on board aVefiel bound
to the Coaft of Africa; or as our Sailors vulgarly
call it, a Voyage to Guiney.
. It was my great Misfortune that in all thefe
Adventures I did not /hip my felf as a Sailor;
whereby, tho' 1 might indeed have work'd a little
harder than ordinary, yet at the fame time I had
learn'd the Duty and Office of a Fore-maft Man»
and in time might have qualified my felf for a
Mare or Lieutenant, if not for a Mailer. But as
it was always my Fate to choofe for the worfe,
fo I did here; for having Money in my Pocket,
and good Cloaths upon my Back, I would always
go on board in the Habit of a Gentleman ; andfo
I neither had any Bufinefs in the Ship, or learn'd to
do any.
It was my Lo't firft of all to fall into pretty good
Company in London, which does not always hap-
pen to fuch loofeand unguided young Fellows as I
then was; the Devil generally not omitting to lay
fome Snare for them very early: But it was not fo
with me, Ifirft fell acquainted with the Mafter of
a Ship who had been on the Coaft ot Guin?y; and
who having had very good Succefs there, was re- •
C folvsd
Yet even in this Voyage I had my Misfortunes
too; particularly, that I was continually Sick, be-
ing thrown into a violent Calenture by the exceffive
Heat of the'Qinute ; our principal Trading being
upon the Coaft, from the Latitude of 15 Degrees,
North even to the Line it felf.
I was now fet up for a Guiney Trader; and my
Friend, to my great Misfortune, dying foon after his
Arrival, I relblved to go the fame Voyage again,
and I embark'd in the fame Veflel with one who was
his Mate in the former Voyage, and had now got
the Command of the Ship. This was the unhap-
pieft Voyage that ever Man made; for tho' I did
not carry quite 100 /. of my new gain'd Wealth,
fo that 1 had 200 left, and which I lodg'd with
my Friend's Widow, who was very juft to me, yet
I fell into terrible Misfortunes in this Voyage; and
the firft was this, viz,. Our Ship making her Courfe
towards the Canary Iflands, or rather between thofe
Iflands and the African Shore, was furprized in the
Grey of the Morning, by zTurki/b Rover of Sallee,
who gave Chafe to us with all the Sail fhe could
make. We crowded alfq as much Canvafs as our
Yards would fpread, or our Mafts Gerry, to have
got clear; b, ut rinding the Pirata gain'd upon us,
and would certainly come up with us in a few
Hours, we prepar a to fight; our Ship having 12
Guns, and the Rogue 18- About three in the Af-
ternoon he came up with us, and bringing too by
Miftake, juft athwart our Quarter, inflead of a-
thw art our Stern, as he intended, we brought 8 of
our Guns to bear on that Side, and pour'd in a
Broadfide upon him, which made him fheer qflfa-
gain, after return ing our Fire, and pouring in alfo
his fm.aU Shot from near 200 Men which he had on
Board. However, we had not a Man touch'd, all
our Men keeping clofe. He prepar'd to attack us
C ^ again
Slaves about his Houfe; and when he came home
again from his Cruife, he ordcr'd me to lye in the
Cabbin to look after the Ship.
Here I meditated nothing but my Efcape; and
what Method I might take to eftect it, but found
no Way that had the leaft Probability in it: No-
thing pre fen ted to make the Suppofition of it ratio-
nal; 'for I had no Body to communicate it to, that
would embark with me, no Fellow-Slave, no Eng-
Ijjhmany Irifiman, or Scot/man there but my felf > fo
that for two Years, tho? I often pleafed my felf with
the Imagination, yet I never had the leaft encoura-
ging Profpect of putting it in Practice.
After about two Years an odd Circumflance pre-
fented it felf, which put the old Thought of ma-
king fome Attempt for my Liberty, again in my
Head.. My Patron lying at Home longer than ufu-
al, withou t fitting out his Ship, which, as I heard,
was for want of Money; he ufed conftantly, once
or twice a Week, fometimes oftner, if the Weather
was fair, to take the Ship's Pinnace, and go out
into the Road a-fifhing; and as he always took me
2nd a young Marefco with him to row the Boat, we
made him very merry, and I prov'd very dexterous
in catching Fifh; infomuch that fometimes he
would fend me with a Moor, one of his Kinfmen,
and the Youth the Marefco as they cali'd him, t|D»
catch a Difh of Fifh for him.
It happen'd one time, that going a fifhing in a
ftark calm Morning, a Fog rofe fo thick, that tho'
we were not half a League from the Shore we loft
Sight of it; and rowing we knew not whither or
which way, w? labour'd all Day, and all the next,
Night, and when the Morning came we found we
had pull'd'off to Sea inftead of pulling in for the
Shore; and that we were at leaft twoLeagu.es from
C 3
thing to accommodate his Guefts; when by and by
my Patron came on board alone, and told me his
Gnefts had put oft" going, upon fome Bufinefs that
fell out, and order'd me with the Man and Boy,
as ufual, to go out with the Boat and catch them
fome Fifh, for that his Friends were to fup at his
Houfe; and commanded that as foon as I got fome
Fifh I fhould bring it home to his Houfe; all which
I prepar'd to do.
This Moment my former Notions of Delive-
rance darted into my Thoughts, for now I found I
was like to have a little Ship at my Command; and
my Matter being gone, 1 prepar'd to furnifh my
felf, not for fifhing Bufinefs, but for a Voyage;
tho' I knew not, neither did I fo much asconlider
whither I mould fteer; for any where to get out
of that Place was my Way.
My firft Contrivance was to make a Pretence to
fpeak to this Moor, to get fomething for our Sub-
fiftance on board ; for I told him wemuft not pre-
fume to eat of our Patron's Bread; he faid, that
was true ; fo he brought a large Basket of Rusk
or Bisket of their kind, and three Jarrs with frefh
Water into the Boat; I knew where my Patron's
Cafe of Bottles flood, which it was evident by
the make were taken out of fome English Prize; and
I convey'd them into the Boat while the Moor was
on Shore, as if they had been there before, for our
Mafter: I convey'd alfo a great Lump of Bees-
Wax into the Boat, which weighed above half a
Hundred Weight, with a Parcel of Twine or
Thread, a Hatchet, a Saw, and a Hammer, all
which were of great Ufe to us afterwards; efpe-
cially the Wax to make Candles. Another Trick
I try'd upon him, which he innocently came into
alfo; his Name was Ifmael, who they call Mulyy
C 4 or
thing behind him, I took him by fuprize with my
Arm under his Twift, and toil him clear over board
into the Sea ; he rife immediately, for he fwam
like a Cork, and call'd to me, begg'd to be taken.
jn, tpld me he would go all over the World with
me; he fwam fb ftrong after the Boat that he would
have reach'd me very quickly, there being but little
Wind ; upon which 1 ftept into the Cabbin, and
fetching one of the Fowling-pieces I prefented it
at him, and told him, I had done him no Hurt, and
if he would be quiet I would do him none: but
laid I, y ou fwim well enough to reach to the Shore
and the Sea is calm, make the beft of your Way to
Shore, and I will do you no flarm,but if you come
near the Boat I'll (boot you thro' the Head ; for I
am refolved to have my Liberty j fo he turn'd him-
felf about and fwam for the Shore, and I make no
doubt but he reach'd it with Eafe, for he was an
Excellent Swimmer.
I could have been content to ha' taken this Moor
with me, and ha' drown'd the Boy, but there was no
venturing to truft him : When he was gone I turn'd
to the Boy, who they call'd Xury, and faid to
him, Xury, if you will be faithful to me I'll make
you a great Man, but if you will not ftroke your
Face to be true to me, that is,fwear £y Mahomet and
his Father's Beard, I muft throw you into the Sea
too; the Boy fmil'd in my Face, and fpoke foinflo-
cently that 1 could not miftrufi him; and fworeVo
be faithful to me, and go all over the World witfr.
me-
'•" While I was in View of the Moor that was
fwimming, I flood out directly to Sea with the Boat,
rather ftretching to Windward, that they might
think me gone towards the Straits-mouth (as indeed
any one that had been in their Wits muft ha' been fup-
pos'd to do)for who wou'd ha'fuppos'd we were fail'd
OB
Day; well Xury, faid I, then I won't, but it may
be we may fee Men by Day, who will be as bad to
us as thofe Lyons ; then we give them thejboot Gun,
fays Xury, laughing, make them run -wey; fuch English
Xury fpoke by converting among us Slaves. Howe-
ves I. was glad to fee the Boy fo cheerful, and I
gave him a Dram (out of our Patron's Cafe of Bot-
tles) to chear him up : After all, Xury's Advice
was good, and I took it, we 4ropp'd our little An-
chor and lay ftill all Night; I fay ftill, for we flept
none ; for in two or three Hours we faw vaft great
Creatures (we knew not what to call them) of
many forts, come down to the Sea-fhore and run in-
to the Water, wallowing and wafhing themfelves
for the Pleafure of cooling themfelves ; and they
made fuch hideous Howlings and Yellings, that I
never indeed heard the like.
Xury was dreadfully frighted, and indeed fowas
I too ; but we were both more frighted when we
heard one of thefe mighty Creatures come fwim-
ming towards our Boat, we could not fee him, but
we might hear him by his blowing to be a mon-
ftrous, huge and furious Beaft; Xury faid it was a
Lyon, and it might be fo for ought I know; but
poor Xury cried to me to weigh the Anchor and
row away; no, fays I, Xury, we can flip our Cable
with the Buoy to it and go off to Sea, they cannot
follow us far; I had no fooner faid fo, but I per-
ceiv'd the Creature (whatever it was) within two
Oars length, which fomething furprized me; how-
ever I immediately ftept to the Cabbin-door, and
taking up my Gun fir'd at him, upon which he im-
mediately turn'd about, and fwam towards the
Shore again.
But it is impoffible todefcribe the horrible Noi-
fes, and hideous Cries and Howlings, that were
raifed
frighted with forae wild Beaft, and I run forward
towards him to help him, but when I came nearer
to him, I faw fomething hanging over his Shoul-
ders which was a Creature that he had fhot, like a
Hare, but different in Colour, and longer Legs,
however we were very glad of it, and it was very
good Meat; but the great Joy that poor Xury
came with, was to tell me he had found good Wa-
ter, and feen no wild Mans.
But we found afterwards that we need not take
fuch Pains for Water, for a little higher up the
Creek where we were, we found the Water frefli
when the Tide was out, which flows but a little
way up ; fo we rilled our Jarrs and feafted on the
Hare we had killed, and prepared to go on our
Way, having feen no Foot-fteps of any human
Creature in that part of the Country.
As I had been one Voyage to this Coaft before,
I knew very well that the Iflands of the Canaries,
and the Cafe de Verd Iflands alfo, lay not far oft"
from the Coaft. But as I had no Inftruments to
take an Obfervation to know what Latitude we
were in, and not exactly know, or at leaft to re-
member what Latitude they were in ; I knew not
where to look for them, or when to ftand off to Sea
towards them; otherwise I might now eafily have
found fome of thefe Iflands. But my Hope was,
that if I flood along this Coaft till I came to that
Part where the Englifh traced, I fhould find fome of
their Veflels upon their ufual Defign of Trade,
that would relieve and take us in.
By the beft of my Calculation, that Place where
I know was, muft be that Country, which lying be-
tween the Emperor of Morocco's Dominions and the
Negroes, lies waft and uninhabited, except by wild
Beafts; the Negroes having abandon'dit, and gone
farther South for fear of the Moors; and the Meors
•. not
bad him lye ftill, and I took our biggeft Gun,
which was almoft Musket-bore, and loaded it with
a good Charge of Powder, and with %wo Slugs,
and laid it down; then I loaded another Gun with
two Bullets, and the third, for we had three Pie-
ces, I loaded with five fmaller Bullets. I took the
beft Aim I could with the firft Piece to have fhot
him into the Head, but he lay fo with his Leg
rais'd a little above his Nofe, that the Slugs hit
his Leg about the Knee, and broke the Bone. He
flatted up growling at firit, but finding his Leg broke
fell down again, and then got up upon three Legs,
and gave the moft hideous Roar that ever I heardi
I was a little furpriz'd that I had not hit him on
the Head ; however I took up the fetond Piece im-
mediately, and tho' he began to move off fir'd a-
gainj and fhot him into the Head, and had the
Pleafure to fee him drop, and make but little Noife,
but lay ftruggling for Life. Then Xury took Heart,
and would have me let him go on Shore : Well, go
faid I; fo the Boy jump'd into the Water, and ta-
king a little Gun in one Hand, fwam to Shore with
the other Hand, and coming clofe to the Creature,
put the Muzzel of the Piece to his Ear, and mot
him into the Head again, which difpatch'd him
quite.
This was Game indeed to us, but this was no
Food, and I was very forry to lofe three Charges of
Powder and Shot upon a Creature that was good
for nothing to us. However Xury faid he would
have fome of him; fo he comes on board, and ask'd
me to give him the Hatchet; for what, Xury, faid
I ? Me cut of hh Head, faid he. However Xury
could not cut oft" his Head, but he cut off a Foot,
and brought it with him, and it was a monftrous
great ojie.
I be-
tie* Weapons in their Hands, except one who had A
long Uender Stick, which Xury faid was a Lance,
and that they would throw them a great way with
gobd Aim; fo I kept at a diftance, but talk'd with
them by Signs as well as I could; and particularly
made Signs for fomething to eat, they beckon'd to
me to Hop my Boat, and they would fetch me
fome Meat; upon this I lower'd the top of my
Sail, and lay by, and two of them run up into the
Country, and in lefs than half an Hour came back,
and brought with them two Pieces of dry Flefh
and fome Corn, fuch as is the Produce of their!
Countrey, but we neither knew what the one or the
other was ; however we were willing to accept it,
but how to come at it was our next Difpute, for I
was not for venturing on Shore to them, and they
were as much affraid of us; but they took a fafd
way for us all, for they brought it to the Shore and
laid it down, and went and Hood a great way off
till we fetch'd it on Boardj and then came clofe to
us again.
We made Signs of Thanks to them, for we had
nothing to make them amends; but an Opportuni*
ty offer'd that very Inilant to oblige them won-
derfully* for while we were lying by the Shore,
came two mighty Creatures, one purfuing the other,
(as we took it) with great Fury, from the Mountains
towards the Sea > whether it was the Male purfuing
the Female,or whether they were in Sport or in Rage,
we could not tell, any more than we could tell whe-
ther it was ufual or ftrange, but I believe it was the
latter; becaufe in the firft Place, thofe ravenous
Creatures feldom appear but in the Night; and in
the fecond Place, we found the People terribly
Frighted, efpecially the Women. The Man that
bad the Lance or Dart did not fly from them,
but the reft did; however as the two Creatures
D taa
ling to have them take it as a Favour from me,
which when I made Signs to them that they might
take him, they were very thankful for, immediate-
ly they fell to work with him, and tho' they had no
Knife, yet with a fharpen'd piece of Wood they took
off his Skin as readily, and much more readily than
we cou'd have done with a Knife; they offer'd me
fome of the Flefh, which I declined, making as if
I would give it them, but made Signs for the Skin,
which they gave me very freely, and brought me a
great deal more of their Provifion, which tho' I did
not underftand, yet I accepted; then I made Signs
to them for fome Water, and held out one of my
Jarrs to them, turning it bottom upward, to fhew
that it was empty, and that I wanted to have it
filled. They call'd immediately to fome of their
Friends, and there came two Women and brought
a great Veflel made of Earth, and burnt as I fup-
pofe in the Sun ; this they fet down ior me, as be-
fore, and I fent Xury on Shore with my Jarrs, and
filled them all three. The Women were as ftark
naked as the Men.
I was now furnifhed with Roots and Corn, fuch
as it was, and Water, and leaving my friendly Ne-
groes, I made forward for about eleven Days more,
without offering to go near the Shore, till I few
the Land run out a great Lepgth into the Sea, at
about the Diflance of four or five Leagues before
me, and the Sea being very calm, I kept a large
offing to make this Point; at length, doubling the
Point at about two Leagues from the Land, I
faw plainly Land on the other Side to Seaward;
then I concluded , as it was moft. certain indeed,
that this was the Cafe de Verd, and thofe the /-
(lands', call'd from thence Cafe de Verd I/lands.
However they were at a great Diflance, and I
could not well ttU what I had beft to do, for if I
D 2 fhould
{hould be taken with a Frefh of Wind I might
neither reach one or other.
In this Dilemna, as I was very pehfive, I fiept
into the Cabbin, and fat me down, Xury having
the Helm, when on a fudden the Boy cry'd out
Mafter, Mafter, a Ship with a Sail, and the foolifh
Boy was frighted out of his Wits, thinking it
rnuft needs be feme of his Mafter's Ships tent to
purfue us, when, I knew we were gotten far enough
out of their reach. I jump'd out of the Cabbin,
and immediately faw not only the Ship, but what
fbe was, (viz*) that it was a Portuguese Ship, and
as I thought was bound to the Coaft of Guinea for
Negroes. But when I obferv'd the Courfe fte
fteer'd, I was foon convinc'd they were bound
feme other way, and did not defign to come any
nearer to the Shore; upon which I ilretch'd out to
Sea as much as I could, refolving to fpeak with
them if poflible.
With all the Sail I could make I found I fhould'
not be able to come in their Way, but that they
would be gone by, before I could make any Signal
to them; but after I had crowded to the unroft,
md began tadefpair, they it feems faw me by the
ielp of their Perfpe6tive-Glaffes, and that it was
"ome European Boat, which as they fuppofed muft
Belong to fome Ship that was loft, fo they fhort-
ied Sail to let me come up. I was encouraged
with this, and as I had my Patron's Antient on
Board, I made a Waft of it to them for a Signal
tf Diftrefs, and fir'd a Gun, both which they faw,
"or they told me they faw the Smoke, tho' they did
lot hear the Gun; upon thefe Signals they very
iindly brought too, and lay by for me, and in a-
>out three Hours time I came up with them.
They ask'd me what I was, in Portuguefe, and in
tyanifl, and in French, but I underftood none of
them;
them ; but at laft a Scots Sailor who was on board,
call'd to me, and I anfwer'd him, and told him I
was an Engliftiman, that I had made my efcape out
of Slavery from the Moors at Sallee ; then they bad
me come on board, and very kindly took me in,
and all my Goods.
It was an inexpreffible Joy to mef that any one
will believe, that I was thus deliver'd, as lefleem'd
it, from fuch a miferable and almoft hopelefs Con-
dition as I was in, and I immediately offered all I
had to the Captain of the Ship, as a Return for
my Deliverance ; but he generoufly told me, he
would take nothing from me, but that all I had
fhould be deliver'd fafe to me when I came to the
Brafils ; for, fays he, I have fan'd your Life on no o-
ther Terms than I would is glad to be faved myfelf, and
it may one time or other be my Lot to be taken up in the
fame Condition ; befides, faid he, when I carry you to
the Brafils, fo great a way from your own Country, if I
Jhould take from you what you have, you will be ftarved
there, and then 1 only take away that Life I have given.
No, no, Seignor, Inglefe, fays he, Mr. Englifhman,
I -will carry you thither in Chanty, andthofe things will
help you to buy your Subfiftance there, and your Pajfage
home again.
As he was Charitable in his Propofal, fo he was
juft in the Performance to a tittle, for he ordered
the Seamen, that none mould offer to touch any
thing I had ; then he took every thing into his own
Poflemon, and gave me back an exact Inventory of
them, that I might have them, even fo much as
my three Earthen Jarrs.
As to my Boat it was a very good one, and
that he faw, and told me he would buy i£pf me
for the Ship's Ufe, and ask'd me what I wotjld have
FQF it ? I told him he had been fo generous to me
in every thing, that I could not offer to make a-
D 3 ny
Lipon which he told me he would give me a Note
af his Hand to pay me 80 Pieces of Eight for it
at Bi.afil, and when it came there, if any one of-
fer'd to give more he would make it up; he ofter'd
me aifo <5o Pieces of Eight more for my Boy Xury,
which I was loath to take, not that I was not wil-
ling to let the Captain have him, but I was very
loath to {ell the poor Boy's Liberty, who had afli-
fted me fo faithfully in procuring my own. How-
ever when I let him know my Reafon, he own'd it
to b.e juft, and offer'd me this Medium, that he
would give the Boy an Obligation to fet him free.
in ten Years, if he turn'd Chriftian ; upon this, and
X*ry faying he was willing to go to him, I let the
Captain have him.
We had a very good Voyage to the Brafils, and
arriv'd in the Bay de Todos los Santo*, or AD-Saints-
Bay, in about Twenty-two Days after. And now
I was once more deliver'd from the moft miferable
of all Conditions of Life, and what to do next
with my felf I was now to confider.
The generous Treatment the Captain gave me,
I can never enough remember; he would take no-
thing of me for my Paflage, gave me twenty Ducats
for the Leopard's Skin, and forty for the Lyon's
Skin which I had in my Boat, and caufed every
rhing I had in the Ship to be punctually deliver'd
me, and what I was witling to fell he bought, fuch
as the Cafe of Bottles, two of my Guns, and a
Piece of the Lump of Bees-wax, for I had made
Candles of the rett; in a word, I made about 220
Pieces of Eight of all my Cargo, and with this
stock I went on Shore in the Brafilo.
I had not been long here, but being recommen-
ied to the Houfe of a good honeft Man like him-
"c!f, who had an Ingeino as they call it; that is, a
Plan-
Plantation and a Sugar-Houfe, I lived with him
foine time, and acquainted my felt" by that Means
with the Manner of their planting and making of
Sugar ; and feeing how well the Planters liv'd, and
how they grew rich fuddenly, I refolv'd, if I could
get Licence to fettle there, I would turn Pianter a-
mong them, refolving in the mean time to find out
fome Way to get my Money which I had left in LOK-
don remitted to me. To this Purpofe getting a kind
of a Letter of Naturalization, I purchaled as much
Land that was Uncur'd, as my Money would reach,
and fornvda Plan for my Plantation and Settlement,
and fuch a one as might be fuitable to the Stock
which I propofed to my felf tq receive from England.
I had a Neighbour, a Portuguese of Lisbon, but
born of Englijh Parents, whofe Name was Wetts,
and in much fuch Circumftances as I was. I call
him Neighbour, becaufe his Plantation lay next
to mine, and we went on very fociable together. My
Stock was but low as well as his ; and we rather
planted for Food, than any thing elfe, for about two
Years. However, we began to increafe, and our
Land began to come into Order; fo that the third
Year we planted fome Tobacco, and made each of
us a large Piece of Ground ready for planting Canes
in the Year to come ; but we both wanted Help;
and now I found more than before, I had done
wrong in parting with my Boy Xury.
But alas ! for me to do wrong that never did right,
was no great Wonder : I had no Remedy but to
go on; I was gotten into an Employment quite re-
mote to my Genius, and directiy contrary to the Life
I delighted in, and for which I forfook my Father's
Houfe, and broke thro'all his good Advice; nay,
I was coming into the very middle. Station, or up-
per Degree of low Life, which my Father advifed
me to before; and which if I refolved to go on
D 4 with
with, I might as well ha' ftaid at Home, and never
have fatigu'd my felf in the World as 1 had done';
and I ufed often to fay to my felf, I could ha'
done this as well in England among my Friends, as
ha' gone 5000 Miles off to do it among Strangers
and Savages in a Wiidernefs, and at fuch a Diftance,
as never to hear from any Part of the World that
had the leaft Knowledge of me.
In this manner I ufed to look upon my Condition
with the utmoft Regret. I had no body to con^
verfe with but now and then this Neighbour; no
Work to be done, but by the Labour of my Hands;
and I ufed to fay, I Hv'd juft like a Man caft away
upon fome defolate Ifland, that had no body there
but himfelf. But how juft has it been, and how mould
all Men reflect, that, when they compare their pre-
fent Conditions with others that are worfe, Heaven
may oblige them to make the Exchange, and be
convinc'd of their forrner Felicity, by their Experi-
ence: I fay, how juft has it been, that the truly foli-
tary Life I reflected on in an Ifland of meer Defola-
tion mould be my Lot, who had fo often unjuIUy
compar'd it. with the Life which I then led, in which
had I continued, I had in all Probability been ex-
ceeding prosperous and rich.
I was in fome Degree fettled in my Meafures for
carrying on the Plantation, before my kind Friend
the Captain of the Snip, that took me up at Sea,
went back ; for the Ship remained there in provi-
ding his Loading, and preparing for his Voyage,
near three Months, when telling h'm what little
Stock I had left behind me in Lcndon, he gave me
this friendly andfir.cere Advice,Seign,cr hglefejays he,
For fo he always called me, if > ou will give meLetters,

try, I will bring you the Produce of them, God
willing, at my Return; but fince human Affairs are
all fubject to Changes and Difafters, I would have
you give Orders but for One Hundred Pounds Sterl.
which you fay is Half your Stock, and let the Ha-
zard be run for the firft; fo that if it come fafe,
you may order the reft the fame Way; and if it
mifcarry, you may have the other Half to have Re-
courfe to for your Supply.
This was fo. wholefome Advice, and lookM fo
friendly, that I could not but beconvinc'd it was the
beft Courfe I could take; fo I accordingly prepared
Letters to the Gentlewoman with whom I had left
my Money, and a Procuration to the Portuguese
Captain, as he defired.
I wrote the English Captain's Widow a full Account
of all my Adventures, my Slavery, Efcape, and how
j'had met with the Portugal Captain at Sea, the Hu-
manityof his Behaviour, and in what Condition I»was
now in, with all other neccflary Directions for my
Supply; and when this honeft Captain came to Lisbon,
he found means by fome of the Englijh Merchants
there, to fend over not the Order only, but a full
Account "of my Story to a Merchant at London,
who reprefented it effe&ually to her ; whereupon,
fhe not only delivered the Money, but out of her
own Pocket fent the Portugal Captain a very hand-
fom Prefent for his Humanity and Charity to me.
The Merchant in London vefting this Hundred
Pounds in Englifi Goods, fuch as the Captain had
writ for, fent them directly to him at Lisbon, and he
brought them all fafe to me to the Bmfils, among
which, without my Direction (for I was too young
in my Bufinefs to think of them ) he had taken Care
to have all Sorts of Tools, Iron-Work, and Uten-
fib
great Ufe to me.
When this Cargo arrived, I thought my Fortune
made, for I was furprized with Joy of it; aud.my
good Steward th^ Captain had laid out the Five
Pounds which my Friend had fent him for a Pre-
, fcnt for himfelf, to purchafe, and bring me over a
Servant under Bond for fix Years Service, and would
not accept of any Confederation, except a little
TobaccOj which I would have him accept, being
of my own Produce.
Neither was this all; but my Goods being all
Englijh Manufactures, fuch as Cloath,. Stuffs, Bays,
and things particularly valuable anddefireable in the .
Country, I found means to fell them to a very great
Advantage ; fo that I may fay, I had more than
four times the Value of my firft Cargo, and was
now infinitely beyond my poor Neighbour, I mran
in the Advancement of my Plantation ; for the firft
x thing I did, I bought me a Negro Slave, and an £«-
vcpean Servant alfo; I mean another befides that
which the Captain brought me from Lisbon,
But as abus'd Profperity is oftentimes made the
very Means of our greateft Adverfity, fo was it with
me. I went on the next Year with great Succefs in
my Plantation : I raifed fifty great Rolls of Tobac-
co on my own Ground, more than I haddifpofed of
for Necellaries among my Neighbours; and thefe
fifty Roils being each of above a looWt. wore
well cur'd and laid by again ft the Return ot the
Fleet from Lisbon : And now incieafing in Bufinefs
and in Wealth, my Head began to be full of Prp-
jectsand Undertakings beyond my Reach; fuch as
.ire, indeed often the .Ruin of the beft Heads io
Bufincfs.
Had
Had I continued in the Station I was now in, I
had room for all the happy things to have yet be-
fallen me, for which my Father fo earneftly recom-
mended a quiet retired Life, and of which he had
fo'fenfibly defcribed the middle Station of Life to
be full of; but other things attended me, and I
was ftill to be the wilful Agent of all my own
Miferies ; and particularly to cncreafe my Fault
and double the Reflexions upon my felf, which in
my future Sorrows I mould have Leifure to make ;
all thefe Mifcarriages were -procured by my appa-
rent obftinate adhering to my foolifh Inclination of
wandrfcig abroad, and purfuing that Inclination, in
contradiction to the cleareft Views ot doing my
felf good in a fair and plain nurfuit of thofe Prof-
pects and thofe Meafures of Life, which Nature
and Providence concurred to prefent me with, and
to make my Duty.
As I had once done thus in my breaking away
from my Parents, fo I could not be content now,
but I muft go and leave the happy View I had of
being a rich and thriving Man in my new Plantati-
on, only to purfue a rafh and immoderate Defire of,
rifing fafler than the Nature ot the Thing admit-
ted ; and thus I caft my felf down again into the
deepeft Gulph of human Mifery that ever Man fell
into, or perhaps could be confident with Life and
a State*of Health in the World.
* To come then by the juft Degrees, to the Parti-
culars of this Part of my Story ; you may fuppofe,
that having now lived almoft four Years in the
Era/Ho, and beginning to thrive and profper very
well upon my Plantation ; I had not only learn'd
the Language, but had contracted Acquaintance
and Eriendfhip among my Fellow-Planters, as well
as among the Merchants at. St. Sahadore, which
was' our Port; and that in my Difcourfes among
them,
them, I had frequently given them an Account of
my two Voyages to the Coaft of Guinea, the
manner of Trading with the Negroes there, and
how eafy it was to purchafe upon the Coaft, for
Trifles, fuch as Beads, Toys, Knives, Sciflars,
Hatchets, bits of Glafs, and the like ; not only
Gold D.ift, Guinea Grains, Elephants Teeth, &c.
but Negroes for the-Service of the Biajils, in great
Numbers.
They liftened always very attentively to my
Difcourfes on thefe Heads, but efpecially to that
Part which related to the buying Negroet, which
was a Trade at that time not only not far entred
into, but as far as it was, had been carried on by
the Affiento's, or Permiflion of the Kings of Spain
and Portugal, and engrofs'd in the Publick, fo that
tew Negroes were brought, .and thofe excelfive
dear.
It happen'd, being in Company with fome Mer-
chants and Planters of my Acquaintance, and
talking of thofe things very earneftly, three of
them came to me the next Morning, and told me
they had been mufing very much upon what I had
difcourfed with them of, the laft Night, and they
came to make a fecret Propofal to me; and after
enjoining me Secrecy, they told me, that they had
a mind to fie o•.it a Ship to go to Guinea., that
they had all Plantations as well as I, and were
flraiten'd for nothing fo much as Servants ; that as
it was a Trade that could not be carried on, be-;
caufe they could not publickly fell the Negroes
when they came home, fo they defired to
make but one Voyage, to bring the Negroes. on
Shore privately, and divide them among their
own, Plantations; and in a Word, the Queftion
was, whether I would go their Super-Cargo in the
Ship to manage the Trading Part upon the Coaft
ot
 of Guinea ? And they offer'd me that I fhould have
my equal Share of the Negroes, without providing
any Part of the Stock.
This was a fair Propofal, it rnuft be confefs'd,
had it been made to any one that" had not had a
Settlement and Plantation of his own to look after,
which was in a fair way of coming to^be very
confiderable, and with a good Stock upon it. But
for me that was thus entered and eftablifhed, and
had nothing to do but go on as I had begun for
three or four Years more, and to have fent for the
other hundred Pound from England, and who in
that time, and with that little Addition, could
fcarce ha' fail'd of being worth three or four thou-
fand Pounds Sterling, and that encreafing too; for
me to think of fuch a Voyage, was the moft pre-
pofterous Thing that ever Man in fuch Circumftan.-
ces could be guilty of.
But I that was born to be my own Deftroyer,
could no more refill the Offer than Ii could re-
ftrain my rirft rambling Defigns, when my Fa-
ther's good Counfel was loft upon me. In a word,
I told them I would go with all my Heart, if
they would undertake to look after my Plantation
in my Abfence, and would difpofe of it to fuch
as I mould direct if I mifcarry'd. This they all
engag'd to do, and entred into Writings or Cove-
nants to do fo; and I made a formal Will, difpo-
fing of my Plantation and Effects, in Cafe of my
Death, making the Captain of the Ship that had
fav'd my Life as before, my univerfal Heir, but
obliging him to difpofe of my Effects as I had di-
rlfcted in my Will, one half of the Produce being
to himfelf, and the other to be fhipp'd to England.
In {hort, I took all poffible Caution to preferve
my Eftects; and keep up my Plantation ; had I u-
fed half as much Prudence to have look'd into my
own
own Intereft, and have made a Judgment of what
1 ought to have done, and not to have done, I had
certainly never gone away from fo profperous an
Undertaking, leaving all the probable Views of a
thriving Circumftance, and gone upon a Voyage to
Sea, artenctd with ail its common Hazards; to fay
nothing of. the Reafons I had to expect particular
Misfortflnes to my felf.
But ,1 was hurry'd on, and obey'd blindly the
Dictates of my Fancy rather than my Reafon : and
accordingly the Ship being fitted out, and the Car-
go furnifhed, and all things done as by Agreement,
by my Partners in the Voyage, I went on Board
in an evil Hour, the th of , being
the fame Day eight Year that I went from my
Father and Mother at Hull, in order to act the
Rebel to their Authority, and the Fool to my own
Intereft.
Our Ship was about 120 Tun Burthen, carried
6 Guns, and 14 Men, befides the Mafter, his Boy,
and my felf; yve had on Board no large Cargo of
Goods , except of fuch Toys as were fit for our
Trade with the Negroes, fuch as Beads, bits of
Glafs, Shells, and odd Trifles, efpecially little
Looking-Glafles, Knives, Sciifars, Hatchets, and
the like.
The fame, Day I went on Board we fet fail,
{landing. away to the Northward upon our own
Coaft, with Delign to ftretch over for the AffruM
Coafi, whew they came about 10 or 12 Degrees of
Northern Latitude, which it feems was the man-
ner of their Courfe in thofe Days. We had very
good Weather, only exceflive hot, all the way up-
on our own Coaft, till we came the Height of
Cafe St. Auguftino, from whence keeping farther off
at Sea \vc lolt Sight of Land, and fteer'd as if we
was bound for the Ifle Few at. d de ftcronka, holding
our
our Courfe N. E. by N, and leaving thofc Hies on
the Eaft ; in this Courfe we paft the Line in about
12 Days time, and were by our laft Obfervation in
7 Degrees iiMin. Northern Latitude, when a vi-
olent Tournado or Hurricane took us quite out of
our Knowledge; it began from the South-Eaft,
came about to the North-Weft, and then fettled
into the North-Eaft, from whence it blew in fnch
a terrible manner, that for 12 Days together we
could do nothing but drive, and fcudding away
before it, let it carry us whither ever Fate and the
Fury of the Winds directed ; and during thefe 12
Days, I need not fay, that I expected every Day
to be fwallowed up, nor indeed did any in the
Ship expect to fave their Lives.
In this Diftrefs, we had, befides the Terror of
the Storm, one of our Men died of the Calenture,
and one Man and the Boy wauYd over-board ; a-
bout the 12th Day the Weather abating a little,
the Mafter made an Obfervation as well as he
could, and found that he was in about n Degrees
North Latitude, but that he was 22 Degrees of
Longitude difference Weft from Cafe St. Auguftinti ;
fo that he found he was gotten upon the Coaft
of Guiney, or the North Part of Brafil, beyond
the River Amcz,ones, toward that of the River Oro-
noque, commonly call'd the Great River, and began
to confuit with me what Courfe he fhould take,
for the Ship was leaky and very much difabled,
and he was going directly back to tHe Coaft of
Brajtt.
I was pofitively againft that, and looking over
the Charts of the Sea-Coaft of America with him,
we concluded there was no inhabited Country for
us to have recourfe to, till we came within the Cir-
cle of the Carribbe-I/lands, and therefore reiolved
to ftand away for Barbadoes, which by keeping off
at
at Sea* to avoid the Indraft of the Bay or Gulph
of Mexico, we might eafily perform, as we hoped,
in about fifteen Days Sail, whereas we could not
poflibly make our Voyage to the Coaft of Africa
without fome Afliitance, both to our Ship and to
our felves.
With this Defign we chang'd our Courfe, and
fleer'd away N. W. by W. in order to reach
fome of our Englijh Iflands, where I hoped for Re-
lief; but our Voyage* was otherwife determined,
for being in the Latitude of 12 Deg. 18 Min. a
fecond Storm came upon us, which carry'd us a-
way with the fame Impetuofity Weftward, and
drove us fo out of the very Way of all humane
Commerce, that had all our Lives been laved, as
to the Sea, we were rather in Danger of being de-
voured by Savages than ever returning to our own
Country.
In this Diftrefs, the Wind ftill blowing very
hard, one of our Men early in the Morning,
cry'd out, Land; and we had no fooner run out
of the Cabbin to look out in hopes of feeing
whereabouts in the World we were ; but the Ship
ftruck upon a Sand, and in a Moment her Motion
being fo ftopp'd, the Sea broke over her in fuch a
manner, that we expected we fhould all have pe-
rifh'd immediately, and we were immediately dri-
ven into our -clofe Quarters to fhelter us from the
very Foam and Sprye of the Sea.
It is ndt eafy for any one, who has not been
in the like Condition, to defcribe or conceive the
Confternation of Men in fuch Circumftances; we
knew nothing where we were, or upon what Land
it was we were driven, whether an Ifland or the
Main, whether inhabited or not inhabited; ^and
as the Rage of the Wind was ftill great, tho ra-
ther lefs than at firft, we could not fo much as
hope
hope to have the Ship hold many Minutes with-
out breaking in Pieces, unlefs the Winds by a kind
of Miracle fhould turn immediately about. In a
word, we fat looking one upon another, and ex-
pecting Death every Moment, and every .Man adt-
ing accordingly, as preparing for another World,
for there was little or nothing more for us to do in
this i that which was our prefent Comfort, and all
the Comfort we had, was, that contrary to our
-Expectation the Ship did not break yet, and that
f.he Mafter faid the Wind began to abate.
Now tho' we thought that the Wind did a little
abate, yet the Ship having thus ftruck upon the
Sand, and flicking too faft for us to expect her" get-
ting off, we were in a dreadful Condition indeed,
and had nothing to do but to think of faving our
Lives as well as we could ; we had a Boat at our
Stern, /uft before the Storm, but fhe was firft ftav'd
by dafhing againft the Ship's Rudder, and in the
next Place fhe broke away, and either funk or
was driven off to Sea, fo there was no hope from
her; we had another Boat on Board, but how to
get her off into the Sea, 'was a doubtful thing;
however, there was no room to debate, for we
fancy'd the Ship would breajc in Pieces every Mi-
nute, and fome told usJlie was actually broken al-
ready.
In this Diftrefs, the Mate of our VeflTel lays hold
of the Boat, and with the help of the reft of the
Men, they got her flung over the Ship's-fide, and
getting all into her, let go, and committed our
felves being Eleven in Number, to God's Mercy,
and the wild Sea; for tho' the Storm was abated
confiderably, yet the Sea went dreadful high upon-
the Shore, and might well be call'd, Den -wild Zee,
as the Dutchrcn\[ the Sea in a Storm.
E Aad
And now our Cafe was very difmal indeed ; for
we ail faw plainly, that the Sea went fo high, that
the Boat could not live, and that we fhould be ine-
vipbiy drowned. As to making Sail, we had none,
nor, it we had, could we have done any thing with
it ;t fo we work'd at the Oar towards the Land,
tno with heavy Hearts, like Men going to Executi-
on; for we all knew, that when the Boat came near-
er the Shore, fhe would be dafh'd in a thoufand
Pieces by the Breach of the Sea. However, we
committed our Souls to God in the moft earncft
Mamie*, and the Wind driving us towards the Shore,
we haften'd our Deftrucftion with our own Hands,
pulling as well as we could towards Land.
What the Shore was, whether Rock or Sand,
whether Steep or Shoal, we knew not; the only
Hope that could rationally give us the leaft Shadow
of Expectation, was, if we might happen into fome
Bay or Gulph, or the Mouth of fome River, where
by great Chance we might have run our Boat in, or
got under the Lee of the Land, and perhaps made
fmooth Water. But there was nothing of this ap-
peared; but as we made nearer and nearer the
Shore, the Land look'd more frightful than the Sea.
Arter we had row'd, or rather driven about a
League and a Half, as we reckon'd it, a raging
Wave, Mountain-like, came rowiing a-ftern of us,
and plainly bad us expect the Couf-de-Grace. In a
word, it took us with fuch a Fury, that it overfet
the. Boat: at once ; and feparating us as well from
the Boat, as from one another, gave us not time
hardly to fay, O God! for we were all fwallowed
up in a Moment.
, Nothing can defcribe the Confufion of Thought
which I felt when I funk into the Water; for tho' I
iwam very well, yet I could not deliver my felf from.
the Waves fo as to draw Breath, till that Wave
havmg
 on towards the Shore, and having fpent it felf, went
back, and left me upon the Land almoft dry, but
half dead with the Water I took in, I had fo much
Prefence of Mind as well as Breath left, that feeing
my felf nearer the main Land than I expeded, I got
upon my Feet, and endeavoured to make on to-
wards the Land as faft as I could, before another
Wave fhould return, and take me up again. But I
foon found it was impoflible to avoid it; for I faw
the Sea come after me as high as a great Hill, and
as furious as an Enemy which I had no Means or
Strength to contend with r my Bufinefs was to hold
my Breath, and rife my felf upon the Water, if I
could : and fo by fwimming to preferve. my Breath-
ing, and Pilot my felf towards the Shore, if poffi-
ble ; my greateft Concern now being, that the Sea,
as it would carry me a great Way towards the Shore
when it came on, might not carry me back again
* with it when it gave back towards the Ssa.
The Wave that came upon me again, buried me
at once 20 or 30 Foot deep in its own Body ; and I
could feel my felf carried with a mighty Force and
Swiftnefs towards the Shore a very great Way; but
I held my Breath, and affifted my felf to fvvim flill
forward with all my Might. I was ready to burft
with holding my Breath, when, as I felt my fel£
rifing up, fo to my "immediate Relief, I found my
Head and Hands Ihoot out above the Surface of the
Water; and tho' it was not two Seconds of Time
that I could keep my felf fo, yet it reliev'd me
greatly, gave me Breath and new Courage. I was
covered again with Water a good while, but not
fo long but I held it out; and finding the Water
had fpent it felf, and began to return, I ftrook for-
ward againft rhe Return of the Waves, and felt
Ground again with my Feet. I flood ftill a few
E a Mo-
Moments to recover Breath, and till the Water
went from me, and then took to my Heels, and run
with what Strength I had farther towards the Shore.
But neither would this deliver me from the Fury of
the Sea, which came pouring in after me a,gain,.
and twice more I was lifted up by the Waves and
carried forwards as before,the Shore being very flat.
The laft Time of thefe two had well near been
fatal to me j for the Sea having hurried me along as
before, landed me, or rather dalh'd me again A a
Piece of a Rock, and that with fuch Force, as it
left me fenfelefs, and indeed helplefs, as to my own
Deliverance; for the Blow taking my Side and
Breaft, beat the Breath as it were quite out of my
Body ; and had it returned again immediately, f
mml have been ftrangled in the Water ; but 1 re-
cover'd a little before the return of the Waves,
and feeing I fhould be cover 'd again with the
Water, I refolv'd to hold fatt by a Piece of the
Rock, and fo to hold my Breath, if poffible, till
the Wave went back ; now as the Waves were not
fo high as at firft, being near Land, I held my
Hold till the Wave abated, and then fetch'd ano-
ther Run, which brought me fo near the Shore,
that the next Wave, tho' it went over me, yet did
not fo fwallow me up as to carry me away, and
the next run I took, I got to the main Land,
where, to my great Comfort, I clamber'd up the
Gifts of the Shore, and fat me down upon the
Grafs, free from Danger, and quite out of the.
Reach of the Water.
I,was now landed, and fafe on Shore, and began
to look up and thauk God that my Life was fav'd in
a Cafe wherein there was feme Minutes before fcarcc
any room to hope. I believe it is impoflible to ex-
prcfs to the Lire what the Extafies and Tranfports of
. the -
the Soul are, when it is fo fav'd, as I may fay, out
of the very Grave; and I do not wonder now at
that Cuttom, viz,':. That when a Malefador, who
has the Halter about his Neck, istyedup, andjuft
going to be turn'd off, and has a Reprieve brought
to him .. I fay, I do not wonder that they bring a
Surgeon with it, to let him Blood that very Mo-
ment they tell him of it, that the Surprize may not
drive the Animal Spirits from the Heart, and over-
whelm him:
\
Furfudden Joys, like Griefs, confound at fir ft.
I walk'd about on the Shore, liftingupmy Hands,
and my whole Being, as I may fay, wrapt up in the
Contemplation of my Deliverance, making a thou-
fand Gefturesand Motions which I cannot defcribe,
reflecting upon all my Comerades that were drown'd,
and that there mould not be one Soul fav'd but my
felf; for, as for them, I never faw them afterwards,
or any Sign of them, except three of their Hats
one Cap, and two Shoes that were not Fellows.
I caftmy Eyes to the ftranded Veflel, when the
Breach and Froth of.the Sea being fo big, I could
hardly fee it, it lay fo far off, and confidered, Lord 1
how was if poffible I could get on Shore /
After I had folac'd my Mind with the comforable
Part of my Condition, I began to look round me to
fee what kind of Place I was in, and what was next
to be done, and I foon found my Comforts abate,
and that in a Word I had a dreadful Deliverance :
For I was wet, had no Cloaths to fhift me, nor any
thing either to eat or drink to comfort me, neither
did I fee any Profpect before me, but that of pe-
rifhing with Hunger, or being devour'd by wild
Brafts; and that which was particularly afflicting
to me, was, that I had no Weapon either to hunt
E 3 and
and kill any Creature for my Suftenance, or to de-
tend my felf againft any other Creature that might
defire to kill me for theirs : In a Word, I had no-
thing about me but a Knife, a Tobacco-pipe, and
a little Tobacco in a Box; this was all my Provili-
on, and this threw me into terrible Agonies of
Mind, that for a while I run about like a Mad-man;
Night coming updfi me, I began with a heavy
Heart to confider what would be my Lot if there
were any ravenous Beafls in that Country, feeing at
Night they always come abroad for their Prey.
All the Remedy that offer'd to my Thoughts at
that Time, was, to get up into a thick bufhy Tree
like a Firr, but thorny, which grew near me, and
where I refolv'd to fit all Night, and confider the
••next Day what Death I fhould dye, for as yet I
faw no Profpect of Life; I walk'd about a Furlong
from the Shore, to fee if I could find any frefh Wa-
ter to drink, which I did, to my great Joy; and ha-
ving drank, and put a little Tobacco in my Mouth
to prevent Hunger, I went to the Tree, and get-
ting up into it, endeavour'd to place my felf fo, as
that if I fhould deep I might not fall; and having
cut me a fhort Stick, like a Truncheon, for my
Defence, I took up my Lodging, and having been
exceffively fatigu'd, I fell fafl afleep, and flept as
comfortably as, I believe, few could have done
in my Condition, and found my felf the moft re-
frefh'd with it, that I think I ever was on fuch an
Occafion.
When I wak'd it was broad Day, the Weather
clear, and the Storm abated, fo that the Sea did
not rage and fwell as before : But that which fur-
priz'd me moft, was, that the Ship was lifted off
in the Night from the Sand where {lie lay, by
the Spelling of the Tyde, and was driven up al-
moft as far as the Rock which I firfl mention 'd,
where
where I had been fo bruis'd by the darning me a-
fainftit; this being within about a Mile from the
hore where I was, and the Ship feeming to fiand
upright ftill, I wifh'd my felf on board, that, at
leaft, I might fave fo'me neceffary things for my
ufe.
When I came down from my Appartment in the
Tree, I look'd about me again, and the firfl thing I
found was the Boat, which lay as the Wind and
the Sea had tofs'd her up upon the Land, about
two Miles on my right Hand, I walk'd as far as I
could upon the Shore to have got to her, but found
a Neck or Inlet of Water between me and the
Boat, which was about half a Mile broad, fo I
came back for the prefent, being more intent upon
getting at the Ship, where I hop'd to find fome-
thing for my prefent Subfiftence,
A little after Noon I found the Sea very calm,
and the Tide ebb'd fo far out, that I could come
within a Quarter of a Mile of the Ship; and here
I found a frefh renewing of my Grief, for I faw
evidently, that if we had kept on Board, we had
been all fafe, that is to fay, we had all got fafe
on Shore, and I had not been fo miferable as to
be left entirely deftitute of all Comfort and Com-
pany, as I now was; this forced Tears from my
Eyes again, but as there was litle Relief in that,
I refolv'd, if poffible, to get to the Ship, fo I
pull'd off my Cloaths, [for the Weather was hot to
Extremity, and took the Water; but when I came
to the Ship, my Difficulty was ftill greater to
know how to get on Board, for as fhe lay a-ground,
and high out of the Water, there was nothing
within my Reach to lay hold of, I fwam round
her twice, and the fecond Time I fpy'd a fmall
Piece of a Rope, which I wonder'd I did not fee
at firft, hang down by the Fore-Chains fo low,
£4 as
as that with great Difficulty i got hold of it, and
by the help of that Rope, got up into the Fore-
caftle of the Ship, here I found that the Ship was
bulg'd, and had a great deal of Water in her Hold,
but that fhe lay fo on the Side of a Bank of hard
Sand, or rather Earth, and her Stern lay lifted up
upon the Bank, and her Head low ahnoft to
the Water; by this Means all her Quarter was
free, and all that was in that Part was dry;
for you may be fure my firft Work was to fearch
and to fee what was fpoird and what was
free; and firft I found that all the Ship's Pro-
vifions were dry and untouch'd by the Water,
and being very well dilpos'd to eat, I went to
the Bread-room and fill'd my Pockets with Bif-
ket, and eat it as I went about other things,
for I had no time to lofe ? I alfo found fome Rum
in the great Cabbin, of which I took a large
Dram, and which I had indeed need enough of
to fpirit me for what was before me: Now I
wanted nothing but a Boat to furnifh my felf with
many things which I forefaw would be very necefla-
ry to me.
It was in vain to fit ftill and wifh for what was
not to be had, and this Extremity rouz'd my
Application j we had feveral fpare Yards, and
two or three large fparrs of Wood, and a fpare
Top-maft or two in the Ship j I .refolv'd to faiJ to
work with thefe, and flung as many of them
over board as I could manage of their Weight,
tying every one with a Rope that they might
not drive away ; when this was done I went down
the Ship's Side, and pulling- them to me, I ty'd
four of them foft together at both Ends as well
as I could, in the Form of a Raft, and laying
two or three fhort Pieces of Plank upon them
Crofs'ways, I found I could walk upon it very
• well,
well, but that it was not able to bear any great
Weight, the Pieces being too light; fo 1 went to
work, and with the Carpentet's •. Saw I cut a fpare
Top-maft into three Lengths, and added them to
my Ratt, with a great deal of Labour and Pains,
but hope of furnilhing my felf with Neceflaries, en-
courag'd me to go beyond what 1 fhould have been
able to have done upon another Occaiion.
My Raft was now ftrong enough to bear any
reafbnable Weight ; my next Care was what co
load it with, and how to preferve what I laid upon
it from the Surf of the Sea; but I was not»long confi-
dering this I firft laid all the Planks or Boards upon
it that I could get, and having confider'd well what
I moft wanted, I finl got three of the Seamens
Chefts, which I had broken open and empty'd, and
lower'd them down upon my Raft; the firft of
thefe I fiil'd with Provifions, viz.. Bread, Rice,
three Dutch Checfcs, five Pieces of dry'd Goat's
Flefh, which we liv'd much upon, and a little Re-
mainder of EurofeanCom which had been laid by
for fome Fowls which we brought "to Sea with us,
but the Fowls were kill'd; there had been fome Ear-
ly and Wheat together, but,£to my great Difap-
pointment, I found afterwards that the Rats had
eaten or fpoil'd'itall j as for Liquors, I found feve-
veral Cafes of Bottles belonging to our Skipper, in
which were fome Cordial Waters, and in all about
. 'five or fix Gallons of Rack, thefe I ftow'd by
themfelve?, there being no need to put them into
the Cheft, nor no room for them. While I was
doing this, I found the Tide began to flow, tho'
very calm, and 1 had the Mortification to fee my
Coat, Shirt, and Waft-coat, .which I had left on
Shore upon the Sand, fwim away j as for my
Breeches which were only Linnen and open-knee'd,
I fwam on board in them and my Stockings : How-
ever
ever this put me upon rummaging for Cloaths, of
which I found enough, but took no more than 1
wanted for prefent ufe, for 1 had other thing.?
which my Eye was more upon, as firft Tools to
work witli on Shore, and it was after long fearch-
ing that I found out the Carpenter's Chett, which
was indeed a very ufeful Prize to me, and much
more valuable than a Ship Loading of Gold would
have been at that time; I got it down to my Raft,
even whole as it was, without loofing time to look
into it, for I knew in general what it contain'd.
My next Care was for fome Ammunition and
Arms; there were two very good Fowling-pieces
in the great Cabbin, and two Piftols, thefe I fe-
cur'd firft, with fome Powder-horns, and a fmall
Bag of Shot, and two old rufty Swords: I knew
there were three Barrels of Powder in the Ship,
but knew not where our Gunner had ftow'd them,
but with much fearch I found them, two of them
dry and good, the third had taken Water, thofe
two I got to my Raft, with the Arms, and now
I thought my felf pretty well freighted, and be-
gan to think how I fhould get to Shore wittathem,
having neither Sail, Oar, or Rudder, and the leaft
Cap full of AVind would have overfet all my Na-
vigation.
I had three Encouragements, i. A fmooth
calm Sea, 2. The Tide rifing" and fetting in to
?he Shore, 3. What little Wind there was blew
me towards the Land; and thus, having found two
or three broken Oars belonging to the Boat, and
befides the Tools which were in the Cheft, I found
two Saws, an Axe, and a Hammer, and with this
Cargo I put to Sea: For a Mile, or thereabouts my
Raft went very well, only that I found it drive a
little diftant from the Place where I had landed be-
fore, by which I perceiv'd that there was fome In-
- draft:
draft of the Water, and confequently I hop'd to
rljid fome Creek or River there, which I might
make ufe of as a'Port to get to Land with my
Cargo.
As I imagin'd, fo it was, there appear'd before
me a little opening of the Land, and I found a
ftrong Current of the Tide fet into it, fo I gui-
ded my Raft as well as I could to keep in the Mid-
dle of the Stream : But here I had like to have
fufrer'd a fecond Shipwreck, which, if I had, I
think verily would have broke my Heart, for know-
ing nothing of the Coaft, my Raft run a-ground
at one end of it upon a Shoal, and not being a-
ground at the other End, it wanted but a little
that all my Cargo had flipp'd off towards tha.t End
that was a-float, and fo fall'n into the Water: I
did my utmoft by fetting my Back againft the
Chefls, to keep them in their Places, but could
not thruft off the Raft with all my Strength, nei-
ther durlt. I ftir from the Pofture I was in, but hold-
ing up the Chefts with all my Might, flood in that
Manner near half an Hour, in which time the rifing
of the Water brought me a little more upon a Le-
vel , and a little after, the Water ftill rifing, my
.Raft floated again, and I thruft her off with the
Oar I had, into the Channel, and then driving up
higher, I at length found my felf in the Mouth of a
little River, with Land on both Sides, and a
ftrong Current or Tide running up, I look'd on both
Sides for a proper Place to get to Shore, for I was
not willing to be driven too high up the River,
hoping in time to fee fome Ship at Sea, and there-
fore refolv'd to place my felf as near the Coait as
I could.
At length I fpy'd a little Cove on the right
Shore, of the Creek, to which with great Pain and
Difficulty I guided my Raft, and at laft got fo near,
as
as that, reaching Ground with my Oar, I coul
thruft her diredly in, but here I had like to havr
dipt all my Cargo in the Sea again; for that Shoe
lying pretty fteep, that is to fay Hoping, the'n
was no Place to land, but where one End of re.
Float, if it run on Shore, would lie fo high, ad"
the other fink lower as before, that it would en-
danger my Cargo again : All that I could do, was
to wait 'till the Tide was at the higheft, keeping the
Raft with my Oar like an Anchor to hold the Side
of it faft to the 'Shore, near 'a flat Piece of
Ground, which I expected the Water would flow
over; and fo it did.. As foon as I found Water
enough, for my Raft drew about a Foot of Water, I
thruft. her on upon that flat Piece of Ground, and
there faften'd or mor'd her by flicking my two
broken Oars into) the Ground; one on one Side
near one End, and one on the other Side near the
other End; and thus I lay till the Water ebb'd a-
way, and left• my Raft and all my Cargo fafe on
Shore.
My next Work was to view the Country, and
feek a proper Place for my Habitation, and where
to flow my Goods to fecure them from whatever
might happen ; where I was, I yet knetfc not, whe-
ther on the Continent or on an Illand,\ whether in-
habited, or not inhabited, whether in Danger of
wi:d B-afts or not: There was a Hill not above
a Mile from me, which rofe up very fteep and high,
arid which fecm'd to over-top fome other Hills
which lay as in a Ridge from it Northward; I took
out one of the Fowling Pieces, and one of the^Pi-
ftols, and an Horn of Powder, and thus arm'd I
travcll'd for Difcovery up to the Top of that Hill,
where after I had wicn great Labour and Difficul-
'tv ROi: to the Top, I faw my Fate to my great
Affliction, (viz,.) that I was in an Ifland environ'd
every
cept fome Rocks which lay a great Way off, and
two fmall Iflands lefs than this, which lay about
three Leagues to the, Weft.
I found alfo that the Ifland I was in was barren,
and, as I faw good Reafon to believe, un-inhabited,
except by wild Beafts, of whom however I faw
none, yet I faw abundance of Fowls, but knew
not their Kinds, neither when I kill'd them could
I tell what was fit for Food, and what not; at my
coming back, I fhot at a great Bird which I faw
fitting upon a Tree on the Side of a great Wood, I
believe it was the firft Gun that had been fir'd
there fince the Creation of the World ; I had no
fooner fir'd, but from all the Parts of the Wood
there arofe an innumerable Number of Fowls of
many Sorts, making a confus'd Screaming, and
crying every one according to his ufual Note; but
not one of them of any Kind that I knew : As for
the Creature I kill'd, I took it to be a Kind of a
Hawk, its Colour and Beak refembling it, but had
no Talons or Claws more than common, its Flefli
wasCarrion, and fit for nothing.
Contented with this Difcovery, I came back to
my Raft, and fell to Work to bring my Cargo on
Shore, which took me up'the -reft of that Day, and
what to do with my fe!f at Night I knew not, nor
indeed where tp reft; for I was afraid to lie down
on the Ground, not knowing but feme wild Beaft
might devour me, tho', as I after wards found, there
was really nc^Need for thofe Fears.
However, as well as I could, I barricadoM my
felf round with the Chefts and Boards that I had
brought on Shore, and made a kind of a Hut for
that Night's Lodging; as for Food, I yet faw not
which" Way to Ripply my felf, except that I had
feen
the Wood where I fhot the Fowl.
I now began to confider, that I might yet get
a great many Things out of the Ship, which would
be ufeful to me, and particularly Tome of the Rig-
ging, and Sails, and fuch other Things as might
come to Land, and I refolv'd to make another Voy-
age on Board the Veffel, if poffible; and as I
knew that the firft Storm that blew muft neceflarily
break her all in Pieces, I refolved to fet all other
Things apart, 'till I got every Thing out of the
Ship that I could get; then Icali'd a Council, that
is to fay, in my Thoughts, whether I fhould take
back the Raft, but this appear'd impracticable; fo
I refoiv'd to go as before, when the Tide was
down, and I did fo, only that I /tripp'd before I
went from my Hutt, having nothing on but a che-
quer'd Shirt, and a Pair of Linnen Drawers, and a
Pair of Pumps on my Feet.
I got on Board the Ship, as before, and prepar'd
a fecond Raft, and having had Experience of the
firft, I neither made this fo unweildy, nor loaded
it fo hard, but yet I brought away feveral Things
very ufeful to me; as firft, in the Carpenter's Stores
I found two or three Bags full of Nails and Spiker,
a great Skreivjack, a Dozen or two of Hatchets,
and above all, that moil ufeful Thing call'd a.
Grind-ftone; all thefe I fecur'd together, with fe-
veral Things belonging to the Gunner, particular-
ly two or three Iron Crows, and two Barrels of
Mufquet-Bullets, feven Mufqucts, and another
Fowl ing-Piece, with fome fmall Quantity of Pow-
der more; a large Bag full of fmall Shot, and a
great Roll of Sheet Lead : But this laft was fo heavy,
I could not hoife it up to get itdver the Ship's Sfde.
Befides thefe Things, I took &11 the Mens Cloaths
that I could find, and a fjur; For^-top-fail, Ham-
mock,
fecond Raft, and brought them all fafe on Shore to
my very great Comfort.
I was under feme Apprehenfioris during my Ab-
fence from the Land, that at leaft my Provisions
might be devour'don Shore; but when I came back,
I found no Sign of any Vifitor, only there fat a
Creature like a wild Cat upon one .of the Chefts,
which when I came towards it, ran away a little
Diftance, and then flood ftill; fhe fat very com-
pos'd, and unconcern'd, and look'd full in my Face,
as if fhe had a Mind to be acquainted with me, I
prefented my Gun at her, but as fhe did not under-
ftand it, fee was perfectly unconcern'd at it, nor.
did fhe ofter to ftir away; upon which I tofs'd her
a bit, of Bisket, tho' by the Way I was not very
free of it, for my Store was not great: However,
I fpar'd her a bit, I fay, and fhe went to it, fmell'd
of it, and ate it, and look'd (as pleas'd) for more,
but I thank'd her, and could fpare no more; fo fhe
march'd off. ;
Having got my fecond Cargo on Shore, tho' I
was fain to open the Barrels of Powder, and. bring
them by Parcels, for they were too heavy, being
large Casks, I went to work to make me a little
Tent with the Sail and feme Poles which I cut for
that Purpofe, and into this Tent I brought every
Thing that I knew would fpoil, either with Rain
or Sun, and I piled all the empty Chefts and Casks
up in a Circle round the Tent, to fortify it from a-
ny fudden Attempt, either from Man or Beaft.
When I had done this I block'd up the Door of
the Tent with fome Boards within, and an empty
Cheft fee up an End xvithout, and fpreadiug one
of the Beds upon the Ground, laying my two Pi-
ftols juft acmy Head, and my Gun at Length by
me, I went to Bed for the firft Time, and flept
very.
hetvy, for the Night before I had fltpt little, and
had Labour'd very hard all Day, as well to fetch all
thofe Things from the Ship, as to get them on
Shore.
I had the biggelr. Magazine of all Kinds now
that ever were laid up, I believe, for one Man ;
but I wa» not fatisfy'd {till ; for while the Ship fat
upright in that Pofture, I tho igbt I ought to gee
every Thing out of her that I could; fo every Day
at low Water I w-nc on BoarJ, and brought away
fome Thing or other: But »particu!arly the third
Time I went, I brought away as much of the Rig-
ging as I could, as alfo all the fmail Ropes and
Royc-twine I could get, with a Piece of ipare Can-
vafs, which was to mend the Sails upon Occa/ion,
the Barrel of wet Gun-powder.. In a VVordJ brought
away all the Sails firft and lalt, only that I was
fain to cut them in Pieces, and bring as much at a
Time as I could ; for they were no more ufeful to
be Sails, but as meerCanvafs only.
But that which comforted me more ftill, was,
that at laft of all, after I had made five or fix fucfl
Voyages as thefe, and thought I had nothing more
to expect from the Ship that was worth my m'ed-
ling with, I fay, after all this, I found a great Hog-
fhead of Bread, and three large'Runlets of Run or
Spirits, and a Box of Sugar, and a Barrel of fine
Flower ', this was furprizing to me, becaufe I had
given over expecting any more Provifions, except
what was fyoii'd by the Water : Ifoon empty'd the
Hogfhead of that Bread, and wrapt it up, Parcel
by Parcel, in Pieces of the Sails, which I cutout:
and in a Word, I got all this fafe on Shore alfo.
The next Day I made anorher Voyage; and
now having plunder'd the Ship of what was porta-
ble
and cutting the great Cable into Pieces, fuch as I
could move, I got two Cables arid a Hawfer oil
Shore, with all the Iron-work I could get, and
having cut down the Spritfail-yard, and the Mi-
fen-yard, and every Thing I could to make a large
Raft, I loaded it with all thofe heavy Goods, and
came away: But my good Luck began now td
leave me; for this Raft was fo unweildy, and fo
overladen, that after I was enter'd the little Cave,
where I had landed the reft of my Goods, not
being able to guide it fo handily as I did the o-
ther, it overfet, and threw me and all my Cargo
into the Water; as for my felf it was no great Harm,
for I was near the Shore; but as to my Cargo, it
Was great part of it loft, efpecially the Iron, which
I expected would have been of great Ufe to me t
However, when the Tide was out, I got moft of
the Pieces of Cable afhore, and fome of the Iron,
tho' with infinite Labour; for I was fain to dip foe
it into the Water, a Work which fatigu'd me very
much ; after this, I went every Day on Boardj
and brought away what I could get.
I had been now 13 Days on Shore, and had been
I1 Times on Board the Ship; in which Time I
had brought away all that one Pair of Hands could
Well be fuppos'd capable to bring, tho' I believe
verily, had the calm Weather held, I mould have
brought away the whole Ship, Piece by Piece :
But prtjparing the 12thTime to go on Board,!found
the Wind begin to rife; however at low Water I
went on Board, and tho' I thought I had ru-
mag'd the Cabbin fo effectually, as that nothing
more could be, founds yet I difcover'd a Locker
with Drawers in it, in one of which I found two
or three Razors, and One Pair of large Sciflars,
with fome ten or a dozen of good Knives and
F * Forks j
value;in Money, Tome European Coin, fome Bra/il,
feme Pieces of Eight, fome Gold, fome Silver.
I fmil'd to my ielf at the Sight of this Money.
0 Drug! faid I aloud, what art thou good for?
Thou art not worth to me, no not the taking oft
of the Ground, one of thofe Knives is worth all
this Heap, I have no Manner of ufe for thee, e'en
remain where thou art, and go to the Bottom as
a Creature whofe Life is not worth faving. How-
ever upon fecond Thoughts, I took it away, and
wrapping all this in a Piece of Canvas, I began
to think of making another Raft, but while I was
preparing this, I found the Sky over-caft, and the
Wind began to rife, and in a Quarter of an Hour
it blew a frefh Gale from the Shore; it prefently
occur'd to me, that it was in vain to pretend to
make a Raft with the Wind oft" Shore, and that
it was my Bufinefs to be gone before the Tide of
Flood began, otherwife I might not be able to
reach the Shore at all: Accordingly I let myfelf
down into the Water, and fwam crofs the Channel,
which lay between the Ship and the Sands, and
even that with Difficulty enough, partly with the
Weight of the Things I had about me, and partly
the Roughnefs of the Water, for the Wind rofe
very haftily, and before it was quite high Water
it blew a Storm.
But I was gotten home to my little Tent, where
1 lay with all my Wealth about me very fefure. It
blew very hard all that Night, and in the Morning
when I look'd out, behold no more Ship was to be
feen, 1 was a little furpriz'd, but recover'd my
fe!f with this fatisfaclory Reflection, viz. That I
had loft no time, nor abated no Diligence to get
every thing out of her that could be ufeful to me,
and that indeed there was little left in her that I
was
 $ras able to bring away, if I had had mbre time;
I now gave over any more Thoughts of the
Ship, or of any thing out of her, except what
might drive on Shore from her Wreck, as indeed
divers Pieces of her afterwards did; but thofe
things were of fmall ufe tome.
My Thoughts were now wholly employ5d about
fecuring my felf againfi either Savages, if any
fhould appear, dr wild Beafls, if any were in the
Ifland ; and I had many Thoughts of the Method
how to do this* and what kind of Dwelling to
make, whether I fhould make me a Cave in the
Earth, or a Tent upon the Earth : And, in fhort,
I refolv'd upon both, the Manner and Defcripti-
on oi which it may not be improper to give an
Account of.
I foon found the Place I was in was not for my
Settlement, particularly becaufe it was upon a low
mooriili Ground near the Sea, and I believ'd would
not be wholfome, and more particularly becaufe
there was no frefh Water near it, fo I refolv'd to
find a more healthy and more convenient Spot of
Ground.
I confulted feveral Things in my Situation which
I found would be proper for me, ift. Health, and
frefh Water, I juft now mentioned, idly, Shelter
from the Heat of the Sun. 3dly, Security from ra-
venous Creatures, whether Men or Beaft. 4thlyi
a View to the Sea, that if God fent any Ship
in Sight, I might not lofe any Advantage for my
Deliverance, of which I was not willing to banifh
all my Expectation yet.
In fearch of a Place proper for this, I found a
little Plain on the fide of a rifing Hill, whofe
Front towards this little Plain was fteep as a
Houfe-fide, fo that nothing could come down up-
on me from the Top ; on the Side of this Roclc
F a therg
the Entrance or Door of a Cave, but there was
not really any Cave or Way into the Rock at all.
On the Flat of the Green, jufl before this hollow
Place, Irefolved to pitch my Tent: This Plain was
not above an hundred Yards broad, and about
twice as long, and lay like a Green before ray
Door, and at the End of it defcended irregularly
every way down into the low Gronnds by the Sea-
fide. It was on the N.N.W, Side of the Hill, fo
that I was fheltered from the Heat every Day, till
it came to a W- and by S. Sun, or thereabouts,
which in thofe Countries is near the Setting.
Before I fet up my Tent, I drew a half Circle
before the hollow Place, which took in about ten
Yards in its Semi-diameter from the Rock, and
twenty Yards in its Diameter, from its Beginning:
and Ending.
In this half Circle I pitch'd two Rows of ftrong
Stakes, driving them into the Ground till they ftood
very firm like £iles, the biggeft End being out of
the Ground about five Foot and a half, and fhar-
pen'd on the Top ; the two Row$ did not ftand
above fix Inches from one another.
Then I took the Pieces of Cable which I had cut
in the Ship, and laid them in Rows one upon.ano-
ther, within the Circle between thefe two Rows
offtakes, up to the Top, placing other Stakes in
the Infide, leaning againft them, about two Foot
and a half high, like a Spur to a Pott, and this
Fence was fo ftrong, that neither Man or Beaft
could get into it or over it: This coft me a great
deal of Time and Labour, efpecially to cut the
Piles in the Woods, bring them to the Place, and
Ji'ive them into the Earth.
The Entrance into this Place I made to be not
t>y a Doer, but by a fhort Ladder, -to go over
the
  over after me, and fo I was compleatly fenced in,
and fortify'd, as I thought, from all the World,
and confequently flept fecure in the Night, which
otherwife I could not have done, tho'as it appear'd
afterward, there was no need of all this Caution
from the Enemies that I apprehended Danger from.
Into this Fence or Fortrefs, with infinite Labour, •
I carry'd all my Riches, all my Provifions, Am-
munition and Stores, of which you have the Ac-
count above, and I made me a large Tent, which
to preferve me from the Rains, that in one Part of
the Year are very violent there, I made double, viz*
one fmaller Tent within, and one larger Tent a-
bove it, and cover'd the uppermoft with a large
Tarpaulin which I had fav'd among the Sails.
And now I lay no more for a while in the Bed
which I had brought on Shore, but in a Hammock,
which was indeed a very good one, and belong'd
to the Mate of the Ship.
Into this Tent I brought all my Provifions, and
every thing that would fpoil by the Wet, and ha-
ving thus enclos'd all my Goods, I made up the
Entrance, which till now I had left open, aad fo
pafs'd and repafs'd, as I faid, by a fhort Ladder.
Wfcen I had done this, I began to work my
Way into the Rock, and bringing all the Earth and
Stones that I dug down, out thro' my Tent, I
laid 'em up within my Fence in the Nature of a
Terras, that fo it rais'd the Ground within about
a Foot and a half; and thus I made me a Cave juft
behind my Tent, which ferv'd me like a Cellar to
my Houfe.
It coft me much Labour, and many Days, before
all thefe Things were brought to Perieclion, and
therefore I muft go back to fome otherThings which
took up fome of my Thoughts. At the fame time it
F 3 happen'd
happen'd after I had laid my Scheme for the let-
ting up my Tent, and making the Cave, that a
Storm of Rain falling from a thick dark Cloud, a
fudden Flam of Lightning happen'd, and after that.
a. great Clap of Thunder, as is naturally the Efteft
of it; I was not fo much furpriz'd with the Light-
ning, as I was with a Thought which darted into
my Mind as fwift as the Lightning it felf: O my
Powder! my very Heart funk within me, when I
thought, that at one Blaft all my Powder might be
deftroy'd; on which, not my Defence only, but the
providing me Food, as I thought, entirely depen-
ded ; I was nothing near fo anxious about my own
Danger, tho' had the Powder took fire, I had ne-
ver known who had hurt me.
Such Impreffion did this make upon me, that af-
ter the Storm was over, I laid afide all my Works,
my Building, and Fortifying, and apply'd my felf
to make Bags and Boxes to feparate the Powder,
and to keep it a little and a little in a Parcel, in
hope, that whatever might come, it might not
all take Fire at once, and to keep it fo apart, that
it fhould not be poffible to make one Part fire a-
nother. I finiuYd this Work in about a Fortnight,
and I think my Powder, which in all was about
•2401. weight, was divided in not lefs than a Hun-
dred Parcels ; as to the Barrel that had been wet,
I did not apprehend any Danger from that, fo I
plac'd it in my new Cave, which in my Fancy I
call'd my Kitchin ; and the reft I hid up and
down in Holes among the Rocks, fo that no wet
might come to ir} marking very carefully where I
laid it.
. In the Interval of time while this was doingj I
went out once at leaft every Day with my Gun,
as well to divert my felf, as to fee if I could kill any
thing fit for Food, and as near as I could to ac-
quaint
quaint my felf with what thelfland produc'd. The
firft time I went out I prefeutly difcover'd that
there were Goats in the Ifland, which was a great
. Satisfaction to me; but then it was attended with
this Misfortune to me, viz,. That they were fo
fhy, fo fubtle, and fo fwift of Foot, that it was
the difficulteft thing in the World to come at them :
But I was not difcourag'd at this, not doubting
but I might now and then fhoot one, as it foon hap-
pen'd, for after I had found their Haunts a little,
I laid wait in this Manner for them.. I obferv'd if
they faw me in the Valleys, tho' they were upon
the Rocks, they would run away as in a terrible
Fright; but if they were feeding in the Valleys,
and I was upon the Rocks, they took no Notice
of me, from whence I concluded, that .by the
Pofition of their Opricks, their Sight was fo di-
rected downward, that they did not readily fee
Objects that were above them ; fo afterward I
took this Method, I always climbed the Rocks fir/I
to get above* them, and then had frequently a fair
Mark. The firft {hot I made among thefe Crea-
tures, I kill'd a She-Goat which had a little Kid
by her which fhe gave fuck to, which griev'd me
heartily; but when the Old one fell, the Kid
ftood ftock ftill by her till I come and took her up,
and not only fo, but when I carried the Old one
with me upon my Shoulders, the Kid follow'd
me quite to my Enclofure, upon which I laid down
the Dam, and took the Kid in my Arms, and
carried it over my Pale, in hopes to have bred it
up tame, but it would not eat, fo I was forc'd to
kill it and eat it my felf; thefe two fupply'd me
with Flefh a great while, for I eat fparingly ; and
fav'd my Provifions (my Bread efpecially) as much
as poffibly I could
F 4 Having
folutely neceflary to provide a Place to make a
Fire in, and Fewel to burn; and what I did for
that, as alfo how I enlarg'd my Cave, and what
Conveniencies I made, I ftiall give a full Account'
of in its Place: But J muft rirft give fome little
Account of my {elf, and of my Thoughts about
Living, which it may well be fuppofed were not
a few.
I had a difmal Profpea of my Condition; for as
I was not caft away upon that Ifland without be-
ing driven, as is faid, by a violent Storm quite out
of theCourfe of our intended Voyage, and a great
Way, viz,, fome Hundreds of Leagues out of the
ordinary Courfe of the Trade of Mankind, I had
great Rcafon to confider it as a Determination of
Heaven, that in this defolare Place, and in this
defolate Manner I fhouldend my Life; the Tears
would run plentifully down my Face when I made
thefe Reflections, and fometimes I would expoftu^
late with my felf, Why Providencefhould thus
compleatly rnin its Creatures, and render them fa
abfolutely miferable, fo without Help abandon'd,
fo entirely deprefs'd, that it could hardly be ra-
tional to be thankful for fuch a Life.
But fomething always return'dfwift upon me to
pheck thcfe Thoughts, and to reprove me; and
particularly one Day walking with my Gun in my
fland by the Sea-fide, I was very peniive upon the
subject of my prefent Condition, when Reafon as
twere expostulating with me to'ther Way, thus;
Veil, you are in a defolate Condition, 'tis true, but
>ray remember, Where are the reft of you ? Did
iOt you come Eleven of you into the Boat, where
re the Ten? Why were not they fav'd and you
jft ? Why were you fingled cut? Is it better to be
ere or there? and then I pointed to the Sea. All
Evils
Evils are to be confider'd with rhe Good that is in
them, and with what worfe attended them.
Then it occurr'd to me again, how well I was
furnifh'd for my Subfiftance, and what would have
been my Cafe if it had not happen'd, Which was
(in Hundred T'hovfand to one, that the Ship floated
from the Place where fhe firft {truck and was dri-
ven fo near to the Shore that I had time to get
all thefe Things out of her.. What would have
been my Cafe, if I had been to have liv'd in the
Condition in which I at firft came on Shore, with-
out Neceflaries of Life, or Neceflaries.to fupply
and procure them ? Particularly faid I aloud, (tho'
to my felf) what fhould I ha' done without a
Gun, without Ammunition, without any Tools
to make any thing, or to work with, without
Cloaths, Bedding, a Tent, or any manner of
Covering ; and that now I had all thefe to a fuffi-
cierit Quantity, and was in a fair way to provide
my felf in fuch a manner, as to live without
my Gun when my Ammunition was fpent.? fo
that I had a tolerabje View of fubfifling(without
^ny Want as long as I liv'd ; for I coafider'd from
the beginning how I would provide for the Acci-
dents that might happen, and for the time that was
to come, even not only after my Ammunition
fhould be fpent, but even after my Health or
Strength fhould decay.
I confefs I had not entertain'd any Notion of my
Ammunition being deftroy'd at one Blaft, I mean
my Powder being blown up by Lightning, and this
made the Thoughts of it fo furprifing to me when
it lighten'd and thunder'd, as I obferv'd juft now.
And now being to enter into a melancholy
Relation of a Scene of filent Life, fuch perhaps as
was neve* heard of in the World before, I ftiall
take it from its Beginning, and continue it in its
Order

or
Books, all which I carehiliy fecur'd. And I muft
not forget, that we had in the Ship a Dog and two
Cats, of whofe eminent Hiflory I may have occa^
fion to fay fomething in its Place; for I carry'd
both the Cats with me ; aud as for the Dog, he
jump'd out of the Ship of himfelf, and fwam on
Shore to me the Day after I went on Shore with my
firft Cargo, and was a trufty Servant to me many
Years; I wanted nothing that he could fetch me,
nor any Company that he could make up to me,
I only wanted to have him talk to me, but that
would not do: As I obferv'd before, I found Pen,
Ink and Paper, and I husbanded them to the ut-
rrioft; and Ifhall fhew, that while my Ink lafted,
I kept things very exact ; but after that was gone,
I could not j for I could not make any Ink, by any
Means that I could devife.
And this put me in mind that I wanted many •
things, notwithftanding all that I had amafs'd to-
gether ; and of thefe, this of Ink was one, as aHb
Spade, Pick-Axe and Shovel, to dig or remove
the Earth; Needles, Pins, and Thread; as for
Linnen, I foon learn'd to want that without much
Difficulty.
This want of Tools made every Work I did go
on heavily, and it was near a whole Year before I
had entirely finifhed my little Pale or furrounded
Habitation: The Piles or Stakes, which were as
heavy as I could well lift, were a long time in cut-
ting and preparing in the Woods, and more by far
in bringing home; fo that I fpent fometimes two
Days in cutting and bringing home one of thofe
Pofts, and a third Day in driving it into the Ground;
for which Purpofe I got a heavy Piece of Wood
at firft, but at laft bethought myfelf of one of the
Jron Crows, which however, tho' I found it, yet
it
rious and tedious Work.
But what need I ha' been concerned at the Te-
ilioufnefs of any thing I had to do, feeing I had
time enough to do it in, nor had I any other Em-
ployment if that had been over, at leaft, that I
could forefee, except the ranging thelfland tofeek
for Food,, which I did more or lefs every Day.
I now began to confider ferioufly my Condition,
and the Circumftance I was reduce to, and I drew
up the State of my Affairs in Writing, not fo much
to leave them to any that were to come after me,
for I was like to have but few Heirs, as to de-
liver my Thoughts from daily poring upon them,
and afflicting my Mind ; and as my Reafon began
now to maftcr my Defpondency, 1 began to com-
fort my felf as well as I could, and to fet the Good
againir. the Evil, that I might have Something to
(diftinguim my Cafe h'om worfe ; and I ftated it
very impartially, like Debtor and Creditor, the
Comforts I enjoy 'd, againft the Miferies I fufter'd,
thus :

wreck'd there ?
I have no Soul to ffeak Bat God wonderfully fent
to, or relieve me. the Ship in near enough to
the Shore, that I have got-
ten out fo many neceffary
things as will either fupfly
my Wants, or en'able me
to fufply my felf even as
long as I live.
Upon the whole, here was an undoubted Tefti?*
mony, that there was fcarce any Condition in the
World fo miferable, but there was fomething nega-
tive or fomething fofetive to be thankful for in it;
and let this Hand as a Direction from the Experi-
ence of the moft miferable of all Conditions in this
World, that we may always find in it fomething
to comfort ourfclves from, and to fet in the De-
fcription of Good and Evil, on the Credit Side of
the Account.
Having now brought my Mind a little to relifii
my Condition, and given over looking out.to Sea,
to fee if I could fpy a Ship; I fay, giving over
thcfe Things, I began to apply my felf to accommo-
date my way of Living, and to make things as ea-
fy to me as I could.
I have
I have already defcribed my Habitation, which
was a Tent under the Side of a Rock, furrounded
with a flrong Pale ofPofts and Cables, but I might
now rather call f it a Wall, for I rais'd a kind of
Wall up againft ft of Turfs, about two Foot thick
on the Outfide, and after fome time-, I think it
was a Year and half, I rais'd Rafters from it, lean-
ing to the Rock, and thatch'd or cover'd it with
Boughs of Trees, and fuch things as I could get to
keep out the Rain, which I found at fome times of
the Year very violent.
I have already obferv'd how I brought all my
Goods into this Pale, and into the Cave which I
had made behind me: But I muft obferve too
that at firft this was a confus'd Heap of Goods,
which as they lay in no Order, fo they took up
all my Place; I had no room to turn my felf; So
I fet my felf to enlarge my Cave and Works far-
ther into the Earth r"fbr it was a loofe fandy Rock,
which yielded eafily to the Labour I beftowedon
it: And fo when I found I was pretty fafe as to
Beafts of Prey, I work'd fideways to the Right
Hand into the Rock; and then turning to the Right
again, work'd quite out, and made me a Door to
come out, on the Outlideof my Pale or Fortifi-
cation.
This gave me not only Egrefs and Regrefs, as
it were a Back-way to my Tent and to my Store-
houfe, but gave me room to flow my Goods.
And now I began to apply my felf to make fuch
neceflary things as I found Imoft wanted, particu-
larly a Chair and a Table; for without thefe I was
not able to enjoy the few Comforts I had in the
World ; I could not write or eat, or feveral things
with fo much Pleafure without a Table.
So I went to work; and here I muft needs ob-
ferve, that as Reafon is the Subftance and Origi-
nal
nal of the Mathematicks, fo by ftating and fqiiar-
ing every thing by Reafon, and by making the
mofr rational Judgment of things', every Man may
bein time Mafter of every mechanick Art. I had
never handled a Tool in my Life, and yet in time
by Labour, Application and Contrivance, I found
at laft that I wanted nothing but I could have made
it, efpecially if I had had Tools ; however, I
I made abundance of things, even without Tools,
'and fome with no more Tools than an Adze and
a Hatchet, which perhaps were never made that
way before, and that with infinite Labour: For
Example, If I wanted a Board, I had no other Way
but to cut down a Tree, fet it on an Edge before
me, and hew it flat on either Side with my Axe,
till I ha4 brought it to be as thin as a Plank, and
then dubb it fmooth with my Adze. It is true,
by this Method I could make but one Board out
of a whole Tree, but this I had no Remedy for
but Patience, any more than I had for the prodi-
gious deal of Time and Labour which it took me
up to make a, Plank or Board : But my Time or
Labour was little worth, and fo it was as well em-
ploy'd one way as another.
However, I made me a Table and a Chair, as
I obferv'd above, in the firft Place, and this I did
out of the fhort Pieces of Boards that I brought
on my Raft from the Ship: But when I had
wrought out fome Boards, as above, I made large
Shelves of the Breadth of a Foot and' a Half one
over another, all along one Side of my Cave, to
lay all my Tools, Nails, and Iron-work, and in a
Word, to feparate every thing at large in their
Places, that I might come eafilyatthem ; I knock'd
Pieces into the Wall of the Rock to hang my Guns
and all things that would hang up. s
So
So that had my Cave been to befeen, it looked
like a general Magazine of all neceflary things,
and I had every thing fo ready at my Hand, that
it was a great Pleafure to me to fee all my Goods
in fuch Order, and efpecially to find my Stock of
all Neceflaries fo great.
And now it was when I began to keep a Jour-
nal of every Day's Employment, tor indeed at firft
I was in too much a Hurry, and nor only Hurry
as to Labour, but in too much Difcompofure of
Mind, and my Journal would ha'been full of many
dull things. For Example, I muft havefaid thus:
Seft. the 3oth, After I got to Shore, and had efcap'd
drowning, inftead of being thankful to God for
my Deliverance, having firft vomited with the
great Quantity of fait Water which was gotten
into my Stomach, and recovering my felf a little, I
ran about the Shore, wringing my Hands, and beat-
ing my Head and Face, exclaiming at my Mifery,
and crying out, I was undone, undone, till tir'd
and faint I was forc'd to lye down oathe Ground
to repofe, but durft not fleep for fear of being de-
vour'd.
Some Days after this, and after I had been on
board the Ship, and got all that I could out of
her, yet I could not forbear getting up to the Top
of a little Mountain, and looking out to Sea in
hopes of feeing a Ship, then fancy at a vaft Di-
fiance I fpy'd a Sail, pleafcmy felf with the Hopes
of it, and then after looking fteadily till I was al-
moft blind, lofe it quite, and fit down and weep
like a Child, and thus encreafe my Mifery by my
Folly.
But having gotten over thefe things in fome Mea-
fure, and having fettled my Houfhold-Stuffand Haj
bitation, made me a Table and a Chair, and all
as handfome about me as Icouid, I began to keep
my
my journal, of which I fhall here give you the
Copy (tho' in it will be told all thefe Particulars
over again) as long as it lafted, for having no
more Ink, I was forc'd to leave it off.
The JOURNAL;
i-* »
SEptember 30. itfjp. I poor miferable Rcbinfoh
Crufoe, being fhipwreck'd, during a dreadful
Storm, in the Offing, came on Shore on this dif-
mal unfortunate Ifland, which I call'd, 'The I/land of
Defpair, all the reft of the Ship's Company being
drown'd, and my felf almoft dead.
All the reft of that Day I fpent in afflicting my
felf at the difmal Circumftances I was brought to*
•viz,. I had neither Food, Houfe, Cloaths, Weapon
or Place to fly to, and in Defpair of any Relief
faw nothing but Deatli before me, either that I
{hould be devour'd by wild Beafts, murther'd by
Savages, or ftarv'd to Death for want of Food. At
the Approach of Night, I flept in a Tree for Fear
of wild Creaturesj but flept foundly tho' it rain'd
all Night.
Ottober i. In the Morning I faw to my great
Surprize the Ship had floated with the high Tide^
and was driven on Shore again much nearer the
Ifland, which as it was fome Comfort on one handi
for feeing her fit upright, and not broken to Pieces*
I hop'd, if the Wind abated, I might get on board,
and get fome Food and Neceflaries out of her for
my Relief; fo on the other hand, it renew'd my
Grief at the Lofs of my Comrades, who I inu-
gin'd if we had all ftaid on Board might have»
fav'd the Ship, or at leaft that they would not have
been all drown'd as they were; and that had the
Men been fav'd, we might perhaps have built us a
Boat out of the Ruins of the Shipj to have car-
G
great part of this Day in perplexing my felf on
thefe things; but at length feeing the Ship almoit
dry, I went upon the Sand as near as I could, and
then fwam on Board j this Day alfo it continu'd
raining, tho' with no Wind at all. - ^
From the ift of O^oler to the 24th. All thef$
Days entirely fpcnt in many feveral Voyages to
get all I could out of the Ship, which I brought
on Shore, every Tide of Flood, upon Rafts. Much
Rain alfo in thefe Days, tho' with fome Intervals
of fair Weather: But, it feems, this was the rainy
Seafon.
Oct. 20. I overfct my Raft, and all the Goods
I had got upon it, but being in fhoal Water, and
the things being chiefly heavy, I recover'd many
of them when the Tide was out.
0:1. 25. It rain'd all Night and all Day, with
fome Gulls of Wind, during which time the Ship
broke in pieces, the Wind blowing a little harder
than before, and was no more to be feen, except
the Wreck of her, and that only at low Water.
I fpcnt this Day in covering and fecuring the Goods
which I had fav'dj that Rain might not fpoil
them-
OJI. 26. I walk'd about the Shore almoft all
Day to find out a Place to fix my Habitation,
greatly concern'd to fecnre my felf from anyAttack.
in the Night, either from wild Beafls or Men.
Towards Night I fix'd upon a proper place under
a Rock, and mark'd out a Semi-Circle for my En-
campment, which I refolv'd to ftrengthen with a
•Work, Wall, or Fortification made of double Piles,
lin'd within with Cable, and without with Turf.
From the atfth to the joth I work'd very hard
in carrying ^il my Goods to my new Habitation
1
hard.
The 31ft in the Morning I went out into the
Ifland with my Gun to fee for fome Food, and dif-
eover the Country; when f kilfd a. She-Goat, and
her Kid follow'd me home, which I afterwards
kiil'd alfo, becaufe it would not feed.
November i. Ifet up my Tent under a Rock, and
lay there for the firft Night, making it as large as
I could with Stakes driving in to fwing my Ham-
mock* upon.
Nov. 2.1 fet up all my Chefts and Boards, and
', the Pieces of Timber which made my Rafts, and
with them form'd a Fence round me, a little with-
in the Place I had mark'd out for my Fortifi-
cation. *
Nov. 3.1 went out with my Gun, and kiil'd two
Fowls like Ducks, which were very good Food.
In the Afternoon went to work to make me a
Table.
Nov. 4. This Morning I began to order my times
of Work, of going out with my Gun, time of
Sleep, and time ofDiverfion, viz,. Every Morning
1 walk d out with my Gun for two or three Hours
if it did not Rain, then employ'd myfelf to work
till about Eleven a-clock, then eat what I had to
live on, and from Twelve to Two I lay down to
ficep, the Weather being exceffive hot, and then,
in the Evening to work again: The working Part
of this Day and of the next were wholly employed
in making my Table, for I was yet but a very forry
Workman, tho' Time and Necefllty made me a
compleat natural Mechanick foon after, as I believe
it would do any one elfe.
Nov. 5., This Day went abroad with my Gun
and my Dog, and kill'd a wild Cat, her Skin
pretty loft, but her Flefh good for nothing: Every
G i " • Creature
ceedingly for this Work, viz,, a Pick-axe, a Shovel,
and a Weeel-barrow or Basket, fo I defined from
my Work, and began to confider how to fupply
that Want, and make me fome Tools: As for a
Pick-axe, I made ufe of the Iron Crows, which
were proper enough, tho' heavyj but the next
thing was a Shovel or Spade ; this was fo abfo-
lutely necefl'ary, that indeed I could do nothing ef-
fectually without it; but what kind of one to make
I k«ew not.
Nw. 18. The next Day in fearching the Woods
J[ found a Tree of that Wood, or like it, which
in the Brafils they call ;he Iron Tree, for its ex-
ceeding Hardnefs; of this, with great Labour and
almoft fpoilingmyAxe, I cut a piece, and brought
it home too with Difficulty enough, for it was ex-
ceeding heavy.
The exceffive Hardnefs of the Wood, and having
no other way, made me a long while upon this
Machine j for I work'd it effectually by little
and little into the Form of a Shovel or Spade,
the Handle exactly fhap'd like ours in England,
•only that the broad Part having no Iron fhod up-
on it at Bottom, it would not laft me fo long;
however it ferv'd well enough for the ufes which I
had occalion to put it to; but never was a Shovel,
I believe, made^ after that Fafhion, or fo long a
making.
I was ftill deficient, for I wanted a Basket or a
Wheel-barrow j a Basket I could not make by any
means, having no fuch things as Twigs that would
bend to make Wicker Ware, at leaft none yet found
out; and as to a Wheel-barrow, I fancy d I could
make all but the Wheel, but that I had no Notion
of, neither did I know how to go about it j befides
I had no poffible way to make the Iron Gudgeons.
03 for
I gave it over; and fo for carrying away the Earth
which I dug out of the Cave, 1 made me a Thing
likeaHodd which the Labourers carry Mortar in,
when they ferve the Bricklayers.
This was not fo difficult to me as the making
the Shovel; and yet this, and the Shovel, and the
Attempt wh'ch I made in vain, to make a Wheel-
barrow, took me up nolefs than four Days, I mean
always, excepting my Morning Walk with my Gun,
which I feldom fail'd ; and very fcldom fail d alfo
bringing Home fomething for to eat,
Nov. 23. My other Work having now flood {till,
becaufe of my making thefe Tools; when they
were finifh'd, I went on, and working every Day,
as my Strength and Time allow'd, I fpcnt eigh-
teen Days entirely in widening and deepening my
Cave, that it might hold my Goods commodi-
oufly.
Note, During all this Time, I work'd to make
this .Room or Cave fpacious enough to accommo-
date me as a Warehoufe or Magazine, a Kitchen,
a Dining-room, and a Cellar; as for my Lodging,
I kept. to the Tent, except that fometimes in the
wet Seafon of the Year, it rain'd fo hard that I
could riot keep my fetf dry, which caus'd me after'
wards to coverall my Place within my Pale with
long Poles in the Form of Rafters, leaning againft
the Rock, and load them with Flags and large
Leaves of Trees like a. Thatch.
December 10. I began now to think my Cave
or Vault finifhed, when on a fudden (it feems I •
had made it too large) a great Quantity of Earth
I'll down from the Top and one Side, fo much
that in fhort it frighted me, and not without Rea-
on too; for if I had been under it, I had never
wanted a Grave-digger: Upon this Difafter I had
a grea.C
a great deal of Work to do over again ; for I had
the loofe Earth to carry out, and which was of
more Importance, I had the Cjeling to prop up, fo
that I might be fure no more would come down.
D. c. 11. This Day I went to Work with it accord-
ing! y, and got two Shores or Pofts pitch'd upright
to the Top, with two Pieces of Boards a-crofs over
each Poft, this I finim'd the next Day; and fetting
more Pofts up with Boards, in about a Week more I
had the Roof fecur'dj and the Pofts ftanding in
Rows,ferv'd me for Partitions to part of: my Houfe.
Dec. 17. From this Day to the Twentieth I
plac'd Shelves, and knock'd up Nails on the Pofts
to hang every Thing up that could be hung up,
and now I began to be in fome Order within
Doors.
Dec. 20. Now I carry'd every Thing into the
Cave, and began to furnifh my Houfe, and fet up
fome Pieces of Boards, like a Drefler, to order my
Victuals upon, but Boards began to be very fcarce
with me; alfo I made me another Table.
Dec. 24. Much Rain ail Night and all Day, no
ftirringout.
Dec. 25. Rain all Day.
Dec. ^6. No Rain, and the Earth much cooler.
than before, and pleafanter.
Dec. 27. Kill'd a young Goat, and lam'd ano-
ther fo that I catch'd it, and led it Home in a
String; when I had it Home, I bound and fplin-
•ter'd up its Leg which was broke. N. B. I
took fuch Care of it, that it liv'd, and the Leg
grew well and as ftrong as ever; but by nurfing
it fo long it grew tame, and fed upon the little
•Gfetfft at my Door, and would not go away:
This was the firft Time that I entertain'd a*
Thought of breeding up fome tame Creatures,
G 4 true
that I might have Food when my Powder and Shot
was all fpent.
Dec. 28, 29, 50. Great Heats and no Breeze ;
{o that there was no ftirring abroad, except in the
Evening for Food ; this Time I fpent in putting
all my Things in Order within Doors.
January i. Very hot ftill, but I went abroad ear-
ly and late with my Gun, and lay ftill in the middle
of the Day. This Evening, going farther into the
Valleys, which lay towards the Center of the Ifland,
I found there was plenty of Goats, tho' exceeding
Ihy and hard to come at ; however I refolv'd to try
if I cofrld not bring my Dog to hunt them down.
Jan. 2. Accordingly, the next Day, I went out
with my Dog, and fet him upon the Goats ; but
I was miftaken, for they all fac'd about upon the
Dog; and he knew his Danger tod well, for 'he
would not come near them.
Jan. 3. I began my Fence or Wall ; which, be-
ing ftill jealous of my being attack'd by fome Bo-
dy, I refolv'd to make very thick and ftrong.
* ' • •
N. B. This Wall being defcrib'd befort, I
• furfofely omit what was faid in the 'Jour-
nal; it is fufficient to obferve, T'hat Iwas
no lefs T'ime than from the 3 d of January
to the iqth of April, -working, fini[hing,and
• perfecting this Wall, tho' it was no men
than about 24 Tards in Length, being a half
Circle from one Place in the Rock to another
Place about eight Tards from it, the Door
of the Cave being in the Center behind ;>.
All this Time I work'd very hard, the Rains
hindering me many Days, nay, fometimes Weeks
together; but I thought I fhould never be perfefi-
ly fecure 'till this Wall -was finifVd; and it is
fcarce
Thing was done with, efpecially the bringing
Piles out of the Woods, and driving them into the
Ground, for I made them much bigger than I need
to have done.
When this Wall was fintfh'd, and the Out-fide
doilble fenc'd with a Turf-Wall rais'd up clofe to
it, I perfwaded my felf that if any People were
to come on Shore there, thejf would not perceive
any Thing like a Habitation; and it was very well
I did fo, as may be obferv'd hereafter upon a very
remarkable Occafion.
During this Time, I made my Rounds in the
Woods for Game every Day when the Rain ad-
mitted me, and made frequent Difcoveries in thefe
Walks of fomething or other to my Advantage ;
p articularly I found a kind of a wild Pidgeons, who
built not as Wood Pidgeons in a Tree, but rather
as Houfe Pidgeons, in the Holes of the Rocks;
and taking fome young ones, I endeavoured to
breed them up lame, and did fo ; but when they
grew older they flew all away, which perhaps was
at firft for Want of feeding them, for I had no-
thing to give them; however I frequently found
their Neils, and got their young ones, which were
very good Meat.
And now in the managing my Houfhold Affairs,
I found my felf wanting in many Things, which
I thought at tirft it was impoflible for me to make,,
as indeed as to fome of them it was; for Inflame,
I could never make a Cask to be hoop'd, I had a
fmail Runlet or two, as I obferv'd before,b\.\t 1 cou'd
never arrive to the Capacity of making one by them
tho' I fpent many Weeks about it; I could neither
put in the Heads, or joint the Staves fo true to one
another, as to make them hold Water, fo I £ave
c-lut alfo over.
*»»•••'.• In
dle ; fo that as foonas ever it was dark, which was
generally by Seven-a-Clock, I was oblig'd to go to
Bed : I rcmembred the Lump of Bees-wax with
which I made Candles in my African Adventure,
but I had none of that now; the only Remedy I
had, was, that when I had kiil'd a Goat, I fav'd
the Tallow, and with a little Djfh made of Clay,
which I bak'd in the S^n, to which I added a Wick
of fome Oakum, I made me a Lamp; and this
gave me Light, tho' not a clear fleady Light like
a Candle ; in the middle of all my Labours it hap-
pen'd, that rumaging my Things, I found a little
Bag, which, as I hinted before, had been fill'd with
Corn for the feeding of Poultry, not for this Vo-
yage, but before, as I fuppofe, when the Ship •
came from Lisbon; what little Remainder of Corn
had been in the Bag, was all devour'd with the
Rats, and I faw nothing in the Bag but Husks and
Duft; 4nd being willing to have the Bag for fome
other Ufe, I think it was to put Powder in, when I
divided it for fear of the Lightning, or fome luch
Ufe, I fhook the Husks of Corn out of it on one
Side of my Fortification under the Rock.
It was a little before the great Rains, juft now
mention'd, that I threw this Scuff away, taking no
Notice of any Thing, and not io much as remem-
bring that I had thrown any Thing there ; when
about a Month after, or thereabout, I faw fome
few Stalks of fomething Green fhooring out of the
Ground, which I fancy'd might be fome Plant I
had not feen, but I was furpriz'd and perfectly a-
ftonifh'd, when after a little longer Time, I faw
about ten or twelve Ears come out, which were
perfect green Barley of the fame Kind as our Euro-*
oean. nay, as our Englijb Barley.
It
It is irnpoffible to exprefs the Aftonifiiment and
Confufion of my Thoughts on this Occafion; I
had hitherto acted upon no religious Foundation at
all; indeed I had very few Notions of. Religion in
ray Head, or had entertain'd aty Senfe of any
Thing that had befallen me, otherwife than as a.
Chance, or, as we lightly fay, what pleafes God,
without fo much as enquiring into the End of Pro-
vidence in thefe Things, or his Order in gover-
ning Events in the World : But after I faw Barley
grow there, in a Climate which I know was not
proper for Corn, and efpeciaily that I knew not
how it came there, it ftartled me ftrangely, and I
began to fuggeft, that God had miraculoufly caus'd
this Grain to grow without any Help of Seed
(own, and that it was fo directed purely for my
Sufienance on that wild miferable Place.
This touch'd my Heart a little, and brought
Tears out of my Eyes, and I began to blefs my
felf, that fuch a Prodigy of Nature fbould happen
upon my Account; and this was the more flrange
to me, becaufe I faw near it ftill all along by the
Side of the Rock, fome other ftragjgling Stalks,
which prov'd to be Stalks of Rice, and which I
knew, becaufe I had feen it grow in Africa, when
I was afhore there.
I not only thought thefjj the pure Productions
of Providence for my Support, but not doubting,
but that there was moie in the Place, I went all
over that Part of the Ifland, where I had been
before peering, in every Corner, and under every
Rock, to fee for more of it, but I could not find
any; at laft it occurr'd to my Thought, that I hacl
Ihook a Bag of Chickens Meat out in that Place,
and then the Wonder began to ceafe; and I muff
confefs, my religious ThankfuJnefs to God's Pro-
vidence bsgan to abate too upon the Difcovc-
• • ring
ring that all this was nothing but whatwas com,*.
mon; tho' I ought to have been as thankful for fo
ftrange and unforefeen Providence, as if it had been
miraculous; for it was really the Work of Pro-
vidence as to me, that fhould order or appoint, '
10 or 12 Grains of Corn fhould remain unfpoil'd
(when the Rats had deftroy'd all the reft) as if it
had been dropt from Heaven: as aHo that I
fhonld throw it out in that particular Place,
where it being in the Shade of a high Rock, it
fprang up immediately; whereas if I had thrown it
it any where elfe at that Time, it had been.' burnt
up and deftroy'd.
I carefully fav'd the Ears of Corn, you may be
fure in their Seafon, which was about the End of
June, and laying up every Corn, I refolv'd tofow
them all again, hoping in Time to have fome
Quantity fufficient to fupply me with Bread; but it
was not till the 4th Year that I could allow my •
felf the leaft Grain of this Corn to eat, and even
then but fparingly, as 1 fhall fay afterwards in its
Order; for I loft all that I fow'd the firft Seafon, by
not ob/erving*the proper Time; for I fow'd it juft
before the dry Seafon, fo that it never came up at
all, at leaft, not as it would have have done : Of
which in its Place.
Beiides this Barley, there was, as above io or
50 Stalks of Rice, which I preferv'd with the fame
Care, and whofe Ufc was of the fame Kind or
to the fame Purpofc, (•»«,) to make me Bread, or
rather Food; for I found Ways to cook it up with-
out baking, tho11 did that alfo after fome Time.
But to return to my Journal.
I work'd exceffive hard thefe three or four
Vfonths to get my Wall done; vand the i4th of
April Iclofedit up, contriving to go into it, not
:>y a Door, but over the Wall by a Ladder, that
* there
bitation.
April 16. I finifh'd the Ladder, fo I went up with
the Ladder to the Top, and then pull'd it up after
me, and let it down on the Infide.- This was a
compleat Enclofure to me ; for within I had Room
enough, and nothing could come at me from with-
out, unlefs it could firft mount my Wall.
The very next Day after this Wall was finifhed,
I had almoft had all my Labour overthrown at
once, and my felf kill'd ; the Cafe was thus : As I
was bufy in the Infide of it, behind my Tent, juft in
the Entrance into my Cave, I was terribly frighted
with' a moft dreadful furprizing Thing indeed;
tor all on a fudden I found the Earth come crum-
bling down from the Roof of my Cave, and from
the Edge of the Hill over my Head, and two of
the Pofts I had fer up in the Cave crack'd in a
friglftful manner: I was heartily feared, but thought
nothing of what was really the Caufe, only think-
ing that the top of my Cave was falling in, as fome
of it had done before; and for fear I fhou'd be bu-
ry'd in it, I ran forward to my Ladder, and not
thinking my felf fafe there neither, I got over my
Wall for fear of the Pieces of the Hill which I ex-
pected might roll down upon me : I was no fooner
ftept down upon the firm Ground, but I plainly
faw it was avertible Earthquake, for the Ground I
flood on {hook three times at about eight Mi-
nutes diftance, with three fach Shocks, as would
have overturned the ftrongeft Building that could
be fuppos'd to have flood on the Earth; and a
great Piece of the Top of a Rock, which .flood a-
bout half a Mile from. me next the Sea, fell down
with fuch a terrible Noife, as I never heard in all
my Life a I perceiv'd alfo, the very Sea was put
into violent Motion by it; and I believe the
Shocks
Ifland.
I was fo arrm'd with the Thing it felf, having
neverfeit the like, or difcourfed with any one that fw;
had, that I was like one dead or ftupify'd; and the bu
Motion of the Earth made myT..onuch lick, like te
one that was tofs'd at Sea; bur die Noife of the to
falling of the Rock awak'd me, as it were, and rou- a
zing me from the fhipified Condition I was in,fiU'd
me with Horror, and I thought of nothing then to
but the Hill falling upon my Tent, and all my Houf- Sii
hold Goods, and burying all at once; and this dti
funk my very Soul within me a fecond time. foi
After the third Shock was over, and I felt no E
more for fome time, I began to take Courage, and ai
yet I had not Heart enough to get over my Wall a-
gain, for fear of being buried alive, but fat ftill t
upon the Ground, greacly caft down and difconfo- t
late, not knowing what to do .• All this while I»had
not the leaft ferious religious Thought, nothing
but the common, Lord ha Mercy upon me; and P
when it was over, that went away too. a
While I fat thus, I found the Air over-caft, and
grow cloudy, as if it would rain ; foon after that t
the Wind rofe by little and little, fo that in lefs i
than half an Hour it blew a moft dreadful Hurri-
cane .. The Sea was all on a fudeen cover'd over
with Foam and Froth, the Shore was gover'd with
the Breach of the Water, the Trees were torn up
by the Roots, and a terrible Storm it was ; and
this held about three Hours, and then began to
abate, and in two Hours more it was ftark calm,
and began to rain very hard.
All this while I fat upon the Ground very much
terrify'd and dejeded, when on a fudden it came
into my Thoughts, that thefe Winds and Rain being
the Confequence of'the Earthquake, the Earthquake
itfelf
itfelf was fpent and over, and I might venture into
my Cave again: With this Thought my Spirits
began to revive, and the Rain alfo helping to pcr-
fwade me, I went in and fat down in my Tent,
but the Rain was fo violent, that my Tent wa*
ready to be beaten down with it; and I was forc'd
to go into my Cave, tho' very much afraid and un-
eafy for fear it fhould fall on my Head.
This violent Rain forc'd me to a new Work, wz..
to cut a Hole thro' my new Fortification like a
Sink to let Water go ous, which would elfe have
drown'd my Cave. After I had been in my Cave
fome Time, and found {till no more Shocks of the
Earthquake follow, 1 began to be more compos d;
and now to fupport my Spirits, which indeed wan-
ted it very much, I went to my little Store, and
took a fmall Sup of Rum, which however I did
then and always very fparingly, knowing I could
have no more when that was gone.
It continu'd raining all that Night, and great
Part of the next Day, fo that I could not ftir
abroad, but my Mind being more compos'd, I be-
gan to think of what I had beft do, concluding*
that if the Ifland was fubjed tothefe Earthquakes,
there would be no living for me in a Cave, but I
muft conlider of building me fome little Hut in an
open Place, which I might furround with a Wallas
1 had done here, and fo make my felf fecilrc from
wild Beafts or Men: But concluded, if I ftaid
where I was, I fhould certainly, one Time or other,
be bury'd alive.
With thefe Thoughts I refolv'd to remove my
Tent from- the Place where it flood, which was.
juft under the hanging Precipice of the Hill, and
which,if it fhould be ftiaken again, would certain-
ly fall upon my Tent : And I fpent the two next
Pays
ving where and I how to remove my Habitation.
The fear of being fwallow'd up alive, made me
that I never flept in quiet, and yet the Apprehen-
fion of lying abroad without any Fence was alraoft
equal to it j but ftiu when Ilook'd about and fi 5
how everything was put in order, how pleafantly
conceal dlwas, and how fafcfrom Danger, it made
me very loth to remove.
In the mean time it occur'd to me that it wouTd
JST a af dCal of tlme for me to do d"* *"d
that 1 muft be contented to run the Venture where
J was, till I had form'd a Camp for my felf, and
had fecured it fo as to remove to it : So with this
Kefo Hmon I compos'd my felf for a time, and re-
lolv d that I would go to work with all fpeed to build
me a Wall with Piles and Cables, &c. in a Circle
as before; and fet my Tent up jn jt when it was
timfh d, but that I would venture to ftay where I
was till it was finifh'd and fit to remove to. This
was the 2 1 ft.
22. The next Morning I began to confider
Means to put this Refolve in Execution, but I
was at a great lofs about my Tools ; I had three
large Axes and abundance of Hatchets, (for we
carried the Hatchets for Traffic!,- with the Indians)
but with much choping and cutting knotty hard
Wood, they were all full of Notches and dull,
and tho'Ihad a Grindftone, I could not turn it and'
grind my Tools too; this coil me as much Thought
as a Statefman would have beftow'd upon a grand
Point of Politicks, or a Judge upon the Life and
Death of a Man. At length I contriv'd a Wheel '
with a String, to turn it with my Foot, that I
might have both my Hands at Liberty : Ncte, I had
never feen any fuch thing in England, or at leaft
not to take Notice how it was done, tho' finc.e I
have
that, my Grind-ftone was very large and heavy;
This Machine coft me a full Week's Work to bring
it to Perfection.
April 28, 29. Thefe two whole Days I took
up in grinding my Tools, my Machine for turning
my Grind-ftone performing very we\l.
April 30, Having perceiv'd my Bread had been
low a great while, now I took a Survey of itj
and reduced myfelf to one Bisket-cake a Day,
which made my Heart very heavy.
May i, In the Morning looking towards the
Sea-fide, the Tide being low, Jfaw fomething lie '•,
on the Shore bigger than ordinary; and it look'd
like a Cask ; when 1 came to it, I found a fniall
Barrel, and two or three Pieces of the Wreck of.^,
the Ship, which were driven on Shore by the late"
Hurricane ; and looking towards the Wreck itfelf^.
I thought it feem'd to lie higher out of the Water
than it us'd to do: I examin'd the Barrel which i
was driven on Shore, and foon found it was a
Barrel of Gun-powder, but it had taken Water,
and the Powder was cak'd as hard as a Stone ;
however I roll'd it farther on Shore for the prefent,
and went on upon the Sands as near as I could t'd
the Wreck of the Ship to look for more. > „,
When I came down to the Ship,I found it ftrange-
ly remov'd; the Fore-caftle, which lay before bu-
ry'd in Sand, was heav'd up at leaft fix Foot; and | ,
the Stern, which was brbke to pieces, and parted
from the reft by the Force of the Sea, foon after I
had left rummaging her, was tofs'd, as it were,upj
and caft on one fide, and the Sand was throwti
fo high on that fide next her Stern,' that whereas
there was a great Place of Water before, fo'that I
could not corrie within 2 Quarter of a Mile of the
Wreck without fwimmine, I. could now walk *•;•
ti uifi
quite up to her when the Tide was out; I was fur-
priz'd with this at firft, but fopn concluded it muft
be done by the Earthquake: And as by this Vio-
lence the Ship was more broken open than former-
ly, fo many things. c•ame daily on Shore, which
the Sea had loofen'd, and which the Winds and
Water rolled by degrees to the Laud.
This wholly diverted my Thoughts from the
Defign of removing my Habitation j and I bufied
myfelf mightily that Day efpecially, in fearching
whether I could make any way into the Ship; but
I found nothing was to be expe&ed of that Kind,
for that all the Infide of the Ship was choak'd up
with Sand: However, as I had learnt not to d§-
fpair of any thiag, I refolvM to pull every thing
to pieces that I could of the Ship, concluding,
. that every thing I could get from her, would be
of fome Ufe or other to me.
May •}, I began with my Saw, and cut a Piece
of a Beam thro", which I thought held fome of the
upper Part or Quarter-Deck together, and when
I .had cut it thro', I clear'd away the Sand as well
as I could from the Side which lay higheft ; but
the Tide coming in, I was obliged to give over
for that time.
May 4, I went a fifhing, but caught not ope Fifii
that I durft eat of, till. I was weary of my Sport;
when juft going to leave off, I caught a young
Dolphin. I had made me a long Line of fome
Rope Yarn, but I had no Hooks, yet I frequently
caught Fifh enough, as much as I car'd to eat;
all which I dry'd in the Sun, and eat them dry. .
May y, Work'd on the Wreck, cut another
Beam afunder, and brought three great Fir Planks
off from the Decks, which I ty'd 'together, and
made fwirn on Shore, when the Tide of Flood
came on. '
May
* *
 Bolts om'of her, and other Pieces of Iron-work^
work'd very hard, and came Home very much
tir'd, and had Thoughts of giving it over.
May j, Went to the Wreck again, but with an
Intent not to work, but found the Weight of the
Wreck had broke itfelf down, the Beams being cut>
that feveral Pieces of the. Ship feem'd to lie loofe,
and the Infide of the Hold lay fo open, that I could
fee into it,, but almoft full of Water and Sand.
May 8, Went to the Wreck, and carry'd an IroA
Crow to wrench up the Deck, which lay now
quite clear of the Water or Sand; I wrench'd open
two Planks, and brought them on Shore alfo with
the Tide : I left the Iron Crow in the Wreck for
next Day.
May 9, Went to the Wreck, and with the Crow1
made way into the Body of the Wreck, and felc
feveral Casks, and loofen'd them with the Crow*
but ceuld not break them up ; I felt alfo the Roll
of Englijb Lead, and could ftir it, but it was too
heavy to remove.
May 10,1,1, i2, 13, *4, Went every Day to
the Wreck, and got a great deal cf Pieces of
Timber, and Boards, or > Plank, and 2 or 300
Weight of Iron.
May 15, I carry'd two Hatchets to try if I
could not cut a Piece off of the Roll of Lead, by
placing the Edge of one Hatchet, and. driving it
with the other; but as it lay about a Foot and a
half in the Water, I could not make any Blow to
drive the Hatchet.
May itf, It had blow'd hard in the Night, and
the Wreck appear'd more broken by the Force of
the Water; but I ftaid fo long in the Woods td
get Pidgeons for Food, that the Tide prevented
me going to the Wreck that Day.
Ha May
A/ay 17, I faw feme Pieces of the \Vreck blowrt (,BJ(
on Shore, at a great Diftance, near two Miles off
me, but refolv'd to fee what they were, and found
it was a Piece of the Head, but too heavy for me
to bring away. ^
May 14, Every Day to this Day I work'd on
the Wreck, and with hard Labour I loofen'd fome
things fo much with the Crow, that the firft
blowing Tide feveral Casks floated out, and two
of the Seamens Chefts ; but the Wind blowing
from the Shore, nothing came to Land that Day
but Pieces of Timber, and a Hogfhead which had
fome Bfaul Pork in it, but the Salt-water and
the Sand had fpoil'd it.
I continu'd this Work every Day to the ijth
of June, except the Time necefiary to get Food,
which I always appointed, during this part of
my Employment, to be when the Tide was up,
that I might be ready when it was ebb'd out;
and by this time I had gotten Timber, and Plank,
and Iron-woik enough to have built a good Boat,
if I had known how; and alfo, I got at feveral
times, and in feveral Pieces, near 100 weight of
the Sheet-Lead.
June 16, Going down to the Sea-fide, I found
a large Tortoife or Turtle ; this was the firft I
had feen, which it feems was only my Misfortune,
not any' Defect of the Place, or Scarcity; for had
I happen'd to be on the other Side of the Ifland,
I might have had Hundreds of them every Day,
as I found afterwards; but perhaps had paid
dear enough for them.
v June 17, I fpent in •cooking the Turtle; I
found in her threefcore Eggs; and her Flefh was
to me at that time the moft favoury and pleafant
that:ever I tafted in my Life, having had noFlefh,
... --. . but
but of. Goats and Fowls, fince I landed in this
horrid Place.
June 18, Rain'd all Day, and I ftay'd within.
I thought at this time the Rajn felt cold, and I
was fomething chilly, which I knew was not
ufual in that Latitude.
June 19, Very ill, and fhivering, as if the Wea-
ther had been cold.
June 20, No Reft all Night, violent Pains in
my Head, and feverifh.
June 21, Very ill, frighted almoft to Death
with the Apprehenfions of my fad Condition, to
be fick, and no Help : Pray'd to G o D for the
firft time fince the Storm off of Hull, but fcarce
knew what I faid, or why; my Thoughts being
all confufed. ,*
June 22, A little better, but under dreadful
Apprehenfions of Sicknefs.
June 23, Very bad again, cold and fhivering,
and then a violent Head-ach.
June 24, Much better.
June 25, An Ague very violent; the Fit held
me feven Hours, cold Fit and hot, with faint
Sweats after it.
yune 26, Better; and having no Victuals to
eat, took my Gun, but found myfelf very weak;
however I kill'd a She-Goat, and with much
Difficulty got it Home, and broil'd fome of it,
and eat; I wou'd fain have ftew'd it, and made
fome Broth, but had no Pot.
June 27, The Ague again fo violent, that I
lay a-bed all Day, and neither eat or drank. I
was ready to perifh for Thirft, but fo weak, I had
not Strength to ftand up, or to get myfelf any
Water to drink : Pray'd to G OD again, but was
light-headed, and when I was not, I was fo igno-
rant, that I knew not what to fay; only I lay and
H 3 cry'd,
CryM, terd look ufoa me, Lord pity me, Lord
fdercy ufoa me : I fuppofe I did nothing elfe for
?wo or three Hours, till the Fit wearing off, I fel\
afleep, and did not wake till far in the Night; when
I wak'd, I found myfelf much refrefH'd, but weak,
and exceeding thirfty: However, as I. had no,
Water in my whole Habitation, I was forc'd to*
lie till Morning, and went to fleep again j In this;
jfecond Sleep, 1 had this terrible Dream.
• I thought, that I was fitting on the Ground on
^he Out-ftde of my Wall, where I fat when the
3torm blew after the Earthquake, and that I faw
a Man defcend from a great black Cloud, in a.
brifeiit Flame of Fire;, and light upon the Ground:,
He was all over as bright as a Flatne, fo that I
Could but juft bear; to look towards him; his;
Countenance was mqft inexpreffibly dreadful^
impoffible for words to defcribe; when he ftep'd
upon the Ground with his Feet, I thought the
Earth trembled, juft as it had done before in the
Earthquake, and all the Air look d to my Appre-
henfion, as if it had been fili'd with Flafhes of Fire.
He was no fooner landed upon the Earth, but.
he rriov'd forward towards me, with a long Speat;
<)]; Weapon in his Hand, to kill me ; and when he
came to a riflng Ground, at fome Diftance, he
fpoke to me, or I heard a Voice fo terrible, that
it is impoffible to exprefs the Terror of it; all that
I can fay I underftood was this, Seeing nil theft
"things have not brought tkee to Repentance, new thou.
fha.lt die: At which Words, I thought he lifted up
the Speac that was in his Hand to kill me^
No one, that fhall ever read this Account, "will,
cxpect that I {hould be able to defcribe the Horror*
of my Soul at this terrible Vifion, I ?nean,that even
while it was a Dream, I even dreamed of tlipfe
tior is i^ any arpte polibje
the IrapreflloQ that remain'd upon my Mind, when
I awak d, and found it was but a Dream.
I had alas! no divine Knowledge; what I had re-
ceiv'd by thegoodlnftruction of my Father was then
worn out by an uninterrupted Series, for 8 Years, of
feafaring Wickednefs, and a conftant Convention
with nothing but fuch as were like myfelf, wicked
and prophane to the laft Degree: I do not remem-
ber that I had in all that time one Thought that fo
much as tended either to looking upwards toward
God, or inwards towards a Reflection upon my
own Ways: But a certain Stupidity of Soul, with-
out Defire of Good, or Confcience of Evil, had
entirely overwhelm'd me,and I was all that the moft
hardned, unthinking, wicked Creature among our
common Sailors can be fuppos'd to be, not having
the leaft Senfe, either of the Fear of God in Dan-
ger, or of Thankfulnefs to God in Deliverances.
In the relating what is already paft of my Story,
this will be the more eafily believed, when I {hall
'add, that thro' all the Variety of Miferies that
had to this Day befallen me, I never had fo much
as one Thought of it being the Hand of God, or
that it was a juft PunnTiment for my Sin, my re-
bellious Behaviour againft my Father, or my pre-
fent Sins,which were great; or fo much as a Punifh-
ment for the general Conrfe of my wicked Life.
When T was on the defperate Expedition on the
defart Shores of Africa, I never had fo much as one
Thought of what would become of me ; or one
Wifh to God to dired: me whither I fhould go, or
to keep me from the Danger which apparently fur-
rounded me, as well from voracious Creatures as
cruel Savages : But I was meerly thoughtlefs of a
God, or a Providence, acted like a meer Brute
from the Principles of Nature, and by the Dilates
of common Scnfe only, and indeed hardly that.
H 4 When
When I was deliver'd and taken up at Sea by
\hePortugal Captain, well us'd and dealt juftly and
honourably with, as well as charitably, 1 had not
the leait Thankfulnefs on my Thoughts: When
again I was fhipwreck'd, ruin'd, and in danger of
drowning on this Ifland, I was as far from Rc-
morfe, or looking on it as a Judgment • I only fai4
to myfelf often, that I was an unfortunate Dog, and
bora to be always miferable.
It is true, when I. got on Shore firft here, and
found all my Ship's Crew drown'd, and myfelf
fpar'd, I was furpriz'd with a kind of Extafy, and
fome Tranfports of Soul, which, had the Grace of
God aflifted, might have come up to true Thank-
fukiefs ; but it ended where it begun, in a meer
common Flight of Joy, or, as I may fay, being glai
1 TUM alive, without the leaft Reflection upon the
diftinguifhing Goodnefs of the Hand which had,
preferv'd me, and had fingled me out to be pre-
ferv'd, when all the reft were deftroy'd ; or an Enr
quiry why Providence had been thus merciful tp
me j even juft the fame common fort of Joy whicfr
Seamen generally have after they are got fafe afhore
from, a Shipwreck,which they drown all in the next
Bowl of Punch, and forget almoft %> fopn as 't is
over, and all the reft of my Life was like it.
Even, when I was afterwards, on due Confidcr
ration, made fenfible of my Condition, ho.w I was
caft on this dreadful Place, out of the Reach of
human Kind, out of all Hope of Relief, or Profpecx
of Redemption, as foon as I faw but a Profpect of
living, and that I fhould not ftarve and perifh ror
Hunger, all the Senfe of my Affliction wore oft,
and 1 begun to be very eafy, apply'd my felf to th,p
Works proper for my Prefervation and Supply, ana
was far enough from being afflicted at my Con-
dition, as a Judgment from Heaven, or as th,e
Hand
which very feldom enter'd into my Head.
The growing up of the Corn, as is hinted in
my Journal, had at firft fome little Influence upon
me, and began to affect me with Serioufnefs, as
Jong as I thought it had fomething miraculous in
it; but as foon as ever that Part of the Thought
was remov'd, all the Impreffion which was rais'd
from it, wore offalfo, as I have noted already.
Even the Earthquake, tho' nothing could be
more terrible in its Nature, or more immediately
directing to the invifible Power, which alone di-
rects fuch things; yet no fooner was the firft Fright
over,but the Impreffion it had made, went offalfo.
I had no more Senfe of God or his Judgments,
much lefs of the prefent Affliction of my Circum-
ftances being from his Hand, than if I had been
in the mpft profperous Condition of Life.
But now when I began to be fick, and a leifure-
ly View of the Miferies of Death came to place
itfelf before me; when my Spirits began to fink
under the Burden of a ftrong Diftemper, and Na-
ture was exhaufted with the Violence of the Fe-
ver ; Confcience that had flept fo long, began to
awake, and I began to reproach myfelf with my
pafl Life, in which I had fo evidently, by uncom-
mon Wickednefs, provok'd the Juftice of God to
lay me under uncommon Strokes, and to deal with
me in fo vindictive a manner,
j • Thefe Reflections opprefs'd me for the fecond or
third Day of my Diftemper, and in the Violence,
as well of th,e Fever, as of the dreadful Reproaches
of my Confcience, extorted fome Words from me,
like praying to Qod, tho' I cannot fay they were
either a Prayer attended with Defires or vyith
Hopes; it was rather the Voice of meer Fright
ant! Diftrefsj my Thoughts were 'confus'd, the
Con vie-
of dying in fuch a miferable Condition, rais'd Va-
pours into my Head with the raeer Apprehen-
fions; and in thefe Hurries of my Soul, I know
not what my Tongue might exprefs ; but it was
rather Exclamation, fuch as, Lord! -what a mife-
rcibk Creature am I? If I fhould be fick, Ijhatt certain*
1y die for want of Help, and -what -will become of me!
Then the Tears burft out of my Eyes, and I
could fay no more for a good while.
In this Interval, the good Advice of my Father
came to my Mind, and prefently his Prediction,
which I mentioned at the Beginning of this Story,
viz. That if I did take this foolijl Step, God would not
llefs me ; and I -would have lei fare hereafter to tifleft
upon having neglected his Counfel, -when there might be
'none to affift in my Recovery. Now, faid I aloud,
my dear Father's Words are come to pafs; God's
Juftice has overtaken me, and I have none to help
or hear me: I rejected the Voice of Providence,
which had mercifully put me in a Pofture or Sta-
tion of Life, wherein I might have been happy and
eafy; but I would neither fee it myfelf, or learn
'to know the Blefling of it from my Parents: I lefr
them to mourn over my Folly, and now I am left
to mourn under the Confequences of Jr. I refus'd
their Help and AfTiftance who would have lifted
me into the World, and wou'd have made every
thing eafy to me, arid now I have Difficulties to
ftruggle with, too great for even Nature itfelf to
fupport, and no Afliftance, no Help, no Comfort,
no Advice: Then I cry'd out, Lord be my Help,
for I am in great Diftreff. '
This was the firft Prayer, if I may call it K>,
that I had made for many Years.^ But I return 10
my Journal.
•Jane
June 28, Having been fomewhat refrefh^ with
the Sleep I had had,' and the Fit being entirety
Oft, I got up; and tho' the Fright and Terror of
my Dream was very great, yet I confider'd, that
the Fit of the Ague wou'd return again the next
Day, and now was my time to g*et fomething to
refrefh and fupport myfelf when I fhould be ill;
2nd the firft thing I did, I fill'd a large fquare.
Cafe Bottle with Water, and fet it upon my Ta-
ble, in Reach of my Bed; and to take off the chilf
or aguifh Difppfition of the Water, I put about.
a Quarter of a Pint of Rum 'into it, and mixM
them together; then I got me a Piece of the
Goat's Flefh, and broil cl it on the Coals, bufc
could eat very little; I walk'd about, but was ve-:
ry weak, and withal very fad and he^vy-hearted
in the Senfe of my miferable Condition; dreading
the Return of my Diftemper .the next Day;.at
flight I made my Supper of three of the Turtle's
Eggs, which I roafted in the Afhes, and eat, as we
call it, in the Shell; and this was the firft Jlit.of
Meat I had ever ask'd God's Bleffing to, e/ven a^
J cou'd remember in my whole Life.
After I had eaten, I try'd to walk, but found[
myfelf fo weak that I cou'd hardly carry the*
Gun, (for I never went out without that) fo l:
went but a little Way, and fat down upon the
Ground, looking out upon the Sea, which was
juft before me, and very calm and fmooth : As.
1 fat here, feme fuch Thoughts as thefe occur'd
to me.
What is this Earth and Sea of which I have feen.
fo much ? whence is it produced ? and what am I,
and all the other Creatures, wild and tame, hu-
and brutal, whence $re we ?
'
Sure we are all made by fome fecret Power,
who form'd the Earth and Sea, the Air and Sky;
and who is that ?
Then it foiiow'd mofl naturally, It is God'that
has made it all: Well, but then it came on ftrangely,
if God has made all thefe Things, He guides and
governs them all, and all Things that concern
chem; for the Power that could make all Things,
muft certainly have Power to guide and dired
them.
If fo, nothing can happen in the great Circuit of
his Works, either without his Knowledge or Ap-
pointment.
And if nothing happens without hisRnowledge,
He knows that I am here, and am in this dreadful
Condition ; and if nothing happens without his
Appointment, he has appointed aH this to befal
me.
Nothing occurr'd to my Thought to contradict
any of thefe Conclufions ; and therefore it refted
upon me with the greater Force, that it muft needs
be, that God has appointed all this to befal me ;
that I was brought to this miferable Circumftance
by his Direction, he having the fole Power, not of
me only, tut of every thing that happen'd in the
World. Immediately it foiiow'd,
Why has God done this to me ? What haw I done to
le thtu us'd ?
My Conference prefently check'd me in that En-
quiry, as if I had blafphem'd, and methought it
fpoke to me like a Voice} WRETCH! do/l thou
ask -what thou baft done! look back upon a dreadful
mif-fpent Life, and ask thy felf -what thou baft nut
'done ? ask, Why is it that thou wert not long ago de-
ftroy'd ? Why wert tfiou not drown d in Yarmouth
' Roads ? Kili'd in the Fight when the Ship was taken by
?he Salle Man of War ? Devour'd by the wild Beafis
09
on the Coaft of Africa ? Or Drown'd HE, R £,
•when all the Crew ferijb'd but thyfelf? Doft thouask
What have I done?.
I was ftruck.dumb with thefe Refle&ions, as one
aftonifh'd, and had not a Word to fay, no not to
ianfwer to myfelf, but rofc up penfive and fad,
walk'd back to my Retreat, arid went up over m/
Wall, as if I had been going to Bed, but my
Thoughts were fadly difturb'd, and I had no In-
clination to fleep ; fo I fat down in my Chair,
and lighted my Lamp, for it began to be dark.
Now as the Apprehenfion of the Return of my Di-
ftemper terrify'd me very much, it occurr'd to my
Thought, that the Brafiltans take no Phyfick but
their Tobacco for almoft all Diftempers ; and I
had a Piece of a Roll of Tobacco in one of the
Chefts, which was quite cur'd, and forrie alfo that
was green and not quite cur'd.
I went, directed by Heaven no doubt; for in
this Cheft I found a Cure both for Soul and Body,
I open'd the Cheft, and found what I look'd for,wi.
the Tobacco ; and as the few Books, I had fav'd,
lay there too, I took out one of the Bibles which
I mention'd before, and which to this Time I had
not found Leifure, or fo much as Inclination to
look into; I fay, I took it out, and brought both
that and the Tobacco with me to the Table.
What Ufe to make of the Tobacco, I knew not,
as to my Diftemper, or whether it was good for it
or no i but I try'd feVeral Experiments with it, as
if I was refolv d it fhould hit one way or other:
1 firft took a Piece of a Leaf, and chew'd it in my
Mouth, which indeed at firft almoft ftupify'd my
Brain, the Tobacco being green and ftrong, and
that I had not been im-ch us'd to it; then ) took
fome and fteep'd it an Hour or two in fome Rum,
aud refolv'd to take a Dofe of it when 1 lay down ;
and
and laftjy, I burnt fpme upon a Pan of Coals, and
held my 'Nofe clofe over tfte Smoak Qf it as long
as I could bear it, as well for the Heat as almolL
for Suffocation. ,
In the Interval of this Operation, I took up the t
Bible and began to read, but my Head was too
much difturp'd with the Tobacco to bear reading^ ;
at leaft that time j only having open'd the Book
eafually, the firft Words that occur'd to me were
thefe, CaS on me in the Day of Trouble, and I will de-
liver, qnd tbou fialt glorify me.
The Words were very apt to my Cafe, and made
fonve Impreffion upon my Thoughts at the time of
reading them, tho' not fo much as they did after-
wards i for as for being deliver'd, the Word had no
Soun.d,i# Ini#yf(iy,to me; the thing was fo remote^
fo impoflible in my Apprehenfion of things, that
I began to fay as the Children of Ifrael did, when
they were promis'd Flefh to eat, Can God ffread a.
Talk in the H/ildcrnefs ? fo I began to fay, Can God
himfelf deliver me from this Place? And as it was
rot for many Years that any Hope appear'd, this
prevail'd very often upon my Thoughts: But
however, the Words made a great Impreflion upon
me, and I mufed upon them very often. It grew
now late, and the Tobacco had, as I faid, doz'd
my Head fo much, that I inclin'd to fleep; fo I
left my Lamp burning in the Cave, left I fhould
want any thing in the Night, and went to Bed j
but before I lay down, I did what I never had done
in all my Life, I kneel'd down and pray'd to God
to fulfil the Promife to me, that if I call'd upon him
in the Day of Trouble, he would deliver me:
After my broken and imperfect Prayer was over, I
drunk the Rum in which I had fteep'd the Tobac-"
co, which was fo flrong and rank of the Tobacco,
that indeed I could fcarce get it down; immediately
upon
... • i.
upon this I went to Bed, I found presently it flew
up in my Bead violently, but I fell into a found
Sleep, and wak'd no more, till by the Sun it muft
necefferily be near threes-Clock in the Afternoon,
the next Day;: nay, to this Hour I'm partly of the
Opinion, that I flept all the next Day and Night,
and till almoft three that Day after; for other-
wife I knew not how I fhould lofe a Day out of
my Reckoning in the Days of the Week, as it ap-
pear'd fojue Years after I had done ; for if I had
loft itbycroffing and recroffing the Line, Ilhould
have loft more than one Day: But certainly I loft a
Day in my Account, and never knew which Way.
Be that however one way or t'other, when I
aw^k'd I found myfelf exceedingly refrefh'd, and
my Spirits lively and chearful; when I got up, I
was ftronger than I was the Day before, and my
Stomach better, for I was hungry; and in fhort, I
had no Fit the next Day, but continu'd much al-
ter'd for the better ; this was the zpth.
The joth was my Well-day of Courfe, and I
went abroad with my Gun, but did not care to
travel too far. I kill'd a Sea-Fowl or two, fomer
thing like a Brand-Goofe, and brought them home,
but was not very forward to eat them; fo I eat
fome more of the Turtle's Eggs, which were very
food: This Evening I renew'd theMedicine which
had fuppos'd did me good the day before, -viz.. the
Tobacco fteep'd in Rum, only I did not take fo
much as before, nor did I chew any of the Leaf, or
hold myHead over the Smoke; however, I was not
fo well the next Day, which was the firftof July,
as I hop'd I fhould have been ; for I had a little
Spice of the cold Fit, but it was not much.
July 2, I renew'd the Medicine all the three
Ways, and doz'd my felf .with it as at firft j and
doubled.the Quantity which I drank.
3. I mifs'd the Fit for good and all, tho* I did
hot recover my full Strength for fome Weeks after;
While I was thus gathering Strength, myThoughts
run exceedingly upon this Scripture, / witt deliver
ithee; and the Impofflbility of my Deliverance lay
much upon my Mind in Bar of my ever expefting
it. But as I was difcouraging myfelf with fuch
Thoughts, it occurr'd to my Mind, that I pored
fo much upon my Deliverance from the main Affli-
ction, that I difregarded the Deliverance I had re^
ceiv'd ; and I was, as it were, made to ask my
felf fuch Queftions as rhefe, viz,. Have I not been
deliver'd,and wonderfully too, fromSicknefs; from
the moft diftrefled Condition that could be, and
that was fo frightful to me, and what Notice I
had taken of it ? Had I done my part, God had de-
livered me; but I had not glorified him ; that is to fay,
I had not own'd and been thankful for that as a
Deliverance, and how could I exped greater De^
liverance?
This touch'd my Heart very much, and imme-
diately I kneel'd down, and gave God Thanks &-
loud for my Recovery from my Sicknefs.
July 4, In the Morning 1 took the Bible, and be^
ginning at the New Teftament, I began ferioufly
to read it, and impos'd upon myfelf to read a-
while every Morning and every Night, not tying
myfelf to the Number of Chapters, but as long as
my Thoughts fhould engage me: It was not long
after I fet ferioufly to this Work, but I found
my Heart more deeply and fincerely affefted with
the Wickednefs of my paft Life : The Im>
preflion of my Dream reviv'd, and the Words, AS
thefe things have not brought thee to Repentance, ran fe-
rionfly in my Thought: I was earneftly begging
of God to give me Repentance, when it happen'd
providentially the very Day that reading the Scrip-
. ture,
ture, I cartie to thefe Words, He is exalted a Prince
'and a SaViour, to give Repentance, attd to gitie Remif-
<fion: I threw down the Book, and with my Heart
as well as my Hands lifted up to Heaven, in a
Kind of Extafy of Joy; I cry'd out aloud, Jeftfa,
thou Son of David, Jefa*, t'bou exalted Prince and. Sa-
viour, giise me Repentance !
This was the firft time that I could .fayj in the
true Senfe of the Words, that I pray'd iti all my
Life; for now I pray'd with a Senfe of my Con-
dition, and with a true Scripture View of Hope
founded on the Encouragement of the Word of
God 5 and from this Time, I may fay, I began to
have Hope that God would hear me.
Now I began to conftrue the Words mentibned
.above, Call on me, and I "xiU deliver you, in a diffe-
rent Senfe from what I had ever done before ; for
then I had no Notion of any thing being call'd De-
liverance, but my being deliver'd from the Capti-
vity I was in ; for tho' I was indeed at large in
the Piacei yet the Ifland was certainly a Prifon to*
jrnc, and that in the worft Senfe in the World?
but now I learn'd to take it in another Senfe:
Now I look'd back upon my paft Life with fucH
Horror, and my Sins appear'd fo dreadful, that
my Soul fought nothing of God, but Deliverance
from the Load of Guilt that bore down all my
Comfort: As for my folitary Life it was nothing ;
I did not fo much as pray to be deliver'd from it,
Or think 6f it ; it was 'all of no Confideratioh in
comparifon to this ; and I add this Part here, to
hint to whoever {hall read it, fhat whenever they
come to a true Senfe of things, they will find De-
liverance from Sin a much greater Biefling thanDe-
Jiverance from Affliction.
BHC leaving this Part, I return to my Journal,
My Condition began now to be, tho' not left
mifcrable as to my Way of living, yet much eafier
to my Mind; and my Thoughts being directed by
a conftant reading the Scripture, and praying to
God, to things of a higher Nature ; 1 had a great
deal of Cemfort within, which till now I knew
nothing of; alfo as my Health and Strength re-
turned, I beftir'd myfelf to furnifh myfelf with eve-
ry thing that I wanted, and make my way of liv-
ing as regular as i could.
From the 4th of July to the i4th, I was chiefly
employ'd in walking about with my Gun in my
Hand, a little and a little at a Time, as a Man
that was gathering up his Strength after a Fit of
Sicknefs: For it is hardly to be imagin'd, how low
I was, and to what Weaknefs I was reduc'd. The
Application which I made ufe of was perfectly
new, and perhaps what had never cur'd an Ague
before, neither can I recommend it to any one to
pra&ife, by this Experiment; and tho' it did car-
ry off the Fit, yet it rather contributed to weaken-
. ing me ; for I had frequent Convulfions in my
Nerves and Limbs for fome time.
I learnt from it alfo this in particular, that be-
ing abroad in the rainy Seafon was the moft perni-
cious thing to my Health that could be, efpecially
in thofe Rains which came attended with Storms
and Hurricanes of Wind • for as the Rain which
' came in a dry Seafon was always moft accompa-
ny'd with fuch Storms, fo I found that Rain was
much more dangerous than the Rain which fell in
September and O&ober.
I had been now in this unhappy Ifland above 10
Months, all Pofllbility of Deliverance from this
Condition feem'd to be entirely taken from me ;
and I firmly believed, that no humane Shape had.
ever fet Foot upon that Place : Having now fecur'd
my
tny Habitation, as 1 thought, fully tb my Mind, 1
had a great Defire to make a more perfect Difco-
very of the Ifland, and to fee what other Produc-
tions I might find, which I yet knew nothing
of.
It was the i5th of July that I began to take a
more particular Survey of the Ifland it fclf : I went
up the Creek firft, where, as I hinted, I brought
my Raits on Shore; I found after I came about
two Miles up, that the Tide did not flow any
higher, and that it was no more than a little
Brook of running Water, and very frefh and good j
but this being the dry Seafon, there was hardly any
Water in feme Parts of it, at leaft not enough to
run in any Stream, fo as it could be perceiv'd.
On the Bank of this Brook I found many plea-
• fant Savana's, or Meadows, plain, fmooth, and •
cover'd with Grafs,- and on the rifing Parts of
them next to the higher Grounds, where the Wa-
ter, as it might be fuppofed, never overflow'd,
I found a great deal of Tobacco, green, and growing
to a great and very flrong Stalk : There were divers
other Plants which I had no Notion of, or tJnder-
ftanding about, and might perhaps have Virtues
of their own, which I could not find out.
I fearched for the Cajfavct Root, which the In-
dians in all that Climate make their Bread of, but I
could find none. I faw large Plants of Aloes, but
did not then underftand them. I faw feveral Sugar;
Canes, but wild, and for want of Cultivation, iffl-'"
perfect. I contented rhyfelf with thefe Difcoveries
for this time, and came back mufing xvith ray
felf \frhat Courfe I might take to know the Virtue
and Goodnefs of any of the Fruits or Plants which.
I {hotdd difcover ; but could bring it to no Con-
clufion ; for in fhort, I had made fo little Obfer-
vatiori while I was in the Bra/th, that I knew little'
of the Plants in the Field, at leaft very little that
might ferve me to any Purpofe now in my Di-
ftrefs.
The next Day, the itfth, I went up the fame
Way again, and after going fomething farther than
I had gone the Day before, I found the Brook, and
the Savanas began to ceafe, and the Country be-
came more woody than before: in this Part I found
different Fruits, and particularly I found Melons
upon the Ground in great Abundance, and Grapes
upon the Trees; the Vines had fpread indeed over
the Trees, and the Clufters of Grapes were juft
now in their Prime, very ripe and rich : This was a
furprifing Difcovery, and I was exceeding glad of
them; but I was warn'd by my Experience to eat
fparingly of them, remembring, that when I was
afhore in Barbary, the eating of Grapes kill'd feve-
ral of our Englijh Men who were Slaves there, by
throwing them into Fluxes and Fevers : But I
found an excellent Ufe for thefe Grapes, and that
was to cure OB dry them in the Sun, and keep them
as dry'd Grapes or Raifins are kept, which I
thought would be, as indeed they were, as whole-
fome, as agreeable to eat, when no Grapes might
be to be had.
I fpent all that Evening there, and went not
back to my Habitation, which by the way was
the firft Night, as I might fay, I had lain from
Home. In the Night I took my firft Contrivance,
and got up into a Tree, where I flept well, and the
next Morning proceeded upon my Difcovery, tra-
velling near four Miles, as I might judge by the
Length of the Valley, keeping ftill dae North, with
a Ridge of Hills on the South and North fide of
me.
At the End of this March I came to an Open-
ing, where the Country feem'd to defcend to the
Weft,
Weft, and a little Spring of freffi Water, which if-
fued out of the Side of the Hill by me, run the
other way, that is due Eaft ; and the Country ap-
pear'd fo frefh, fo green, foflourifhing, every thing
being in a conftant Verdure, or Flourifh ok'Spring,
that it it look'd like a planted Garden.
I defcended a little on the Side of that delicious
Vale, Purveying it with a fecret Kind of Pleafure,
(tho' mixt with my other afflicting Thoughts) to
think that this was all my own, that I was King
and Lord of all this Country indefeafibly, and had
a Right of Pofleffion ; and if I could convey it,
I might have it in Inheritance, as .compleatly as
any Lord of a Manor in England. I faw here
Abundance of Cocoa Trees, Orange, and Le-
mon, and Citron Trees ; but all wild, and very
few bearing any Fruit, at leaft not then : How-
ever, the green Limes that I gathered, were not
only pleafant to eat, but very wholefome ; and I
mix'd their Juice afterwards with Water, which
made it very wholefome, and very cool, and re-
fijefhing.
I found now I had Bufinefs enough to gather and
^arry Home; and I refolv'd to lay up a Store, as
well of Grapes, as Limes and Lemons, to furnifh
myfelf for the wet Seafon, which I knew was ap-
proaching.
In order to this, I gather'd a great Heap of
Grapes' in one Place, and a lefler Heap in another
Place, and a great Parcel of Limes and Lemons in
another Place ; and taking a few of each with me,
I travel'd homeward, and refolv'd to come again,
and bring a Bag or Sack, or what I could make, to
carry the reft Home.
Accordingly, having fpent three Days in this
Journey, I came Home, fo I muft now call my
Tent and my Cave: But before I got thither, the
I 3 Grapes
and the Weight of the Juice having broken them,
and bruis'd them, they were good tor little or no-
ching ; as to the Limes, they were good, but I
could bting but a few.
The next Day, being the ipth, I went back,
having made me two fmall Bags to bring Home
my Harveii : But I was lurpriz'd, when coming
to my Heap ot Grapes, which were fo rich and
fine when 1 gather'd them, I found them all fpread
about, trod to pieces, and drag'd about, fome
here, fome there, and Abundance eaten and de->
vourM: By thi§ I concluded, there were fome wild
Creatures thereabouts, which had done this j but
what they were I knew not.
However, as I found that there was no laying
them up on Heaps, and no carrying them away in
a Sack, but that one way they would be deftroy'd,
and the other way they would be crufh'd with
their own Weight; I took another Courfe; for I
gather'd a large Quantity of the Grapes, and hung
them up upon the out Branches of the Trees, that
they might cure and dry in the Sun j and as for .
the Limes and Lemons, I carry'das many back as.
J could well ftand under.
When I came Home from this Journey, I con-
templated with great Pleafure the Fruitfulnefs of
that Valley, and the Pleafantnefs of the Situation,
the Security from Storms on that Side the Water,.
and the Wood, and concluded, that I had pitch'd
upon a Place to fix my Abode, which was by fat
fhe worft Part of the Country. Upon the whole
I began to confider of removing my Habitation ;
and to look out for a Place equally fafe, as where
I now was fituate, if poffible, in that pkafant
frHitfulPartQfthe.Iflan&
This
exceeding fond of it for fome Tim», the Pieafant-
nefs of the Place tempting me; but when I came
to a nearer View of it, and to confider that I was
now by the Sea-fide, where it was at leaft polfible"
that fomething might happen to my Advantage,
and by 'the fame ill Fate that brought me hither,
might bring fome other unhappy Wretches to the
fame Place; and tho'.it was fcarce probable that
any fuch thing fhould ever happen, yet to enclofe
myfelf among the Hills and Woods, in the Center
of the Ifland, was to anticipate my Bondage, and
to render fuch an Affair not only improbable, but
impoffible ; and that therefore I ought not by any
Means to remove.
However, I was fo enamour'd of this Place,"
that I fpent much of my Time therefor the whole
remaining Part of the Month of 'July ; and tho'
upon fecond Thoughts I refolv'd as above, not to
remove, yet I built me a little kind of a Bower,
and furrounded it at a Pittance with a ftrong
Fence, being a double Hedge, as high as I could
reach, well ftak'd, and fill'd between with Brujh-.
-wood; and here I lay very fecure, fometimes two '
or three Nights together, always going over it
with a Ladder, as before; fo that I fancy'd now I
had my Country-Hoiife, and my Sea-Coaft-Hoafe:
And this Work took me up to the Beginning of
Auguft.'
I had but newly finifii'd my Fence, and began
to enjoy my Labour, but the Rains came on, and
made me ftickclofeto myfii.ftHabitation; for tho'
1 had made me"a Tent like the other, with a Piece
of a Sail, and fpread it very well; yet I had not;
the Shelter of a Hill to keep me from Storms, nor a
Cave behind me to retreat into, when the Rains
were extraordinary.
I 4 About
About the Beginning of Auguft, at I fad, \ had
finifh'd my Eower, and began to enjoy myfelf.
The third of Auguft, I found the Grapes I had
hung up were perfectly dry'd, and indeed, were
excellent good Raifins of the Sun ; fo I began to,
take them down from the Trees, and it was very
happy that I did fo ; for the Rains which follow'd
would have fppil'd them, and I had loll the beft
Part of my Winter Food ; for I had above two,
hundred large Bunches of them. No fooner had
I taken them ail down and qarry'd moft of them
Home to my Cave, but it began to rain ; and from
hence, which was the fourteenth of Auguft, itrain'd
more or lefs, every Day, till the middle of Qllober ;
and fometimes fo violently, that I could not ftir
out of my Cave for feveral Days.
In this Seafon I was much furpriz'd with th$ ,
Increase of my Family : I had been concern'd for
the Lofs of one of my Cats, \vho run away from
me, or at I thought had been dead, and I heard no
more Tale or Tidings of her, till to my Aftonifh-
ment fhe came home about the End of Augitft,
with three 'Kittens. This was the more ftrange to
mz, becaufe thb' I had kill'd a wild Cat, as J
call'd it, with my Gun j yet I thought it was a,
quite differing Kind frpm our European Cats; yet
the young Cats were the fame kind pf Houfe-
breed like the old onej and both my Gats being
Females, I thought it very ftrange: But frorrf thefe.
three Cats, I afterwards came to be fo pefter d
with Cats, that I was fprc'd to kiil them likeVer-
min, or wild Beafls, and to drive them fr,om rojr,
Houfe as much as ppffible.
From the fourteenth of^w^tp the twenty.
fixth, inceffant Rain, fo that I could not ftir, and
was now very careful not to be much wet. In this
Confinement I began to be ftraitn^dl for Food, but
venturing
venturing out twice, I one Day kill'd a Goat, and
the laft Day, which was the twenty-fixth, found
a very large Tortoife, which was a Treat to me,
and ray Food was regulated thus; I eat a Bunch
of Raifins for my Breakfaft, a Piece of the Goat's
Flefh, or of the Turtle for my Dinner broil'd ;
for to my great Misfortune, 1 had no Veflel to
boil or flew any thing; and two or three of the
Turtle's Eggs for my Supper.
During this Confinement in my Cover by the
Rain, 1 work'd daily two or three Hours at en*
}arging my Cave, and by Degrees work'd it on
towards one Side, till I came to the Outfide of the
Hill, and made a Door or Way out, which came
beyond my Fence or Wall, and fo I came in and
out this Way : but I was not perfectly eafy at
lying fo open; for as I had manag'd myfelf be-
fore, 1 was in a perfect Enclofure, whereas now I
thought 1 lay expos.d, and open for any thing to
come in upon me; and yet 1 could not perceive
that there was any living thing to fear, the big-
geft Creature that 1 had >et feen upon the Ifland
being a Goat.
September the thirtieth, I was now come to the
unhappy Anniverfary of my Landing. I caft up the
Notches on my Poft, and found 1 had been on
Shore three hundred and fixty five Days. I kept
this Day as a folemn Faft, fetting it apart to Re-
ligious Exercife, proftrating myfelf on the Ground
with the moft ferious Humiliation, confefling my
Sins to God, acknowledging his righteous Judg-
ments upon me, and praying to him to have Mer-
cy on me, thro' Jefus Chrift; and having noc
tafted the leaft Refrefhment for twelve Hours,
even till the going down of the Sun, I then eat a
Bisket-Cake, and a Bunch of Grapes, and went to
Bed, finishing thtf Day as I began, it.
I M
I had all this time obferv'd no Sabbath-Day;
for as at firft 1 had no Senfe of Religion upon my
Mind, 1 had atter fome time omitted to diftm-
guifh the Weeks, by making a longer Notch than
ordinary for the Sabbath-Day, and fo did not really
kr.ow what any of the Days were; but now hav-
ing caft up the Days, as above, I found I had been
there a Year; fo 1 divided it into Weeks, and fet
apart every feventh Day for a Sabbath; tho' I
found at the End of my Account 1 had loft a Day
or two in my Reckoning.
A little after this my Ink began to fail me, *nd
fo 1 contented myfelf to ufe it more fparingiy, and
to write down only the moil remarkable Events of
my Life, without continuing a daily Memorandum
of other things.
The rainy Seafon, and the dry Seafon, began now
to appear regular to me, and 1 learnt to divide
them fo, as to provide for them 'accordingly. But
I bought all my Experience before I had it; and
this 1 am going tb relate, was one of the moft dif-
couraging Experiments that I made at all: I have
mention'd that I had fav'd the few Ears of Barley
and Rice which I had fo furprizingly found fpring
up, as i thought, of themfelves, and belfeve there
were about thirty Stalks of Rice, and about twen-
ty of Barley; and now I thought it a proper time
to fow it after the Rains, the Sun J^ing in its
Southern Pofition going from me. w+
Accordingly I dug up a Piece of Ground, as
well as I could with my wooden Spade, and di-
viding it into two Parts, I fow'd my Grain; but •
as I was fowing, it cafually occur^ko my Thoughts,
that I would not fow it all at firft, becaufe 1 did
not know when was the proper time for it; fp I
fow'd about two thirds of the Seed, leaving about
a handful of each.
1 did fo, for not one Grain of that 1 fow'd this
time came to any thing; for the dry Months
following, the Earth having had no Rain after
the Seed was fown, it had no Moifture to affift
its Growth, and never came up at all, till the
wet Seafon had come again, and then it grew as
if it had been but newly fown.
Finding my firft Seed did not grow, which I
eafily imagin'd was by the Drought, i fought for
a moifter Piece of Ground to make another Ttial
in, and I dug up a Piece of Ground near my new
Bower, and fow'd the reft of my Seed iri February^
a little before the Vernal Equinox; and this having
the rainy Months of March and April to water it,
fprung up very pleafantly, and yielded a very good
Crop; but having Part of the Seed left only, and
not daring to fbw all that I had, 1 had but a fmall
Quantity at laft, my whole Crop not amounting
to above half a Peck of each kind. ,
But by thjs Experiment I was made Mailer of
my Bunj^fs, and knew exactly when the proper
Seafon fFas to fow; and that i might expect two
Seed-tiyfes, and two Harvefts every Year.
While this Corn was growing, I made a little
Difcovery .which was of life to me afterwards :
Asfoon as the Rains were over, and the Weather
began to fettle, which was about the Month of
November, I made a Vifit up the Country to my
Bower, where tho' I had not been fome Months,
yet I found all things juft as I left them. The Cir-
cle or double Hedge that I had made, was not on-
ly firm and entire, 'but the Stakes which 1 had cut
out of fome Trees that grew thereabouts, were all
fhot out and grown with long Branches, as much
as a Willow-tree ufuaily fhoots the firft Year after
Japping its Head, J could uor tell what Tree to
call
dall it, ^ that thefe Stakes were cut from. I was
furpriz'd, and yet very well pleas 'd, to fee the
young Trees grow ; and I prun'd them, and led
them up to grow as much alike as I could ; and
it is fcarce credible how beautiful a Figure they
grew into in three Years; fo that tho" the
Hedge made a Circle of about twenty five Yards
in Diameter, yet the Trees, for fuch I might
now call them, foon cover'd it ; and it was a
compleat Shade, fufficient to lodge under all the
dry Seafon.
This made me refolve to cut fome more Stakes,
and make me a Hedge like this in a Semicircle
round my Wall ; I mean that of my firft Dwelling,
which I did; and placing the Trees or Stakes in
a double Row, at about eight Yards diftance from
my firft Fence, they grew prefently, and were at
firft a fine Cover to my Habitation, and afterward
ferv'd for a Defence alfo, as I fhall obferve in its
Order.
I found now, that the Seafons of the Year
might generally be divided, not into Summer and
Winter, as in Europe; but into the rainy Seafons,
and the dry Seafons, which were generally thus :
Rainy, the Sun being then on, or
near the ****»*'
 Dry, the Sun being then to the,
North Of the Line.

The Rainy Seafon fometimes held longer or
fhorter, as the Winds happen'd to blow ; but this
was the general Obfervation I made : After I had
found, by Experience, the ill Confequence of being
abroad in the Rain, I took care to furnifh myfelf
with Provifions before-hand, that I might not be
oblig'd to go out ; and I fat within Doors as much
as poflible during the wet Months.
In this Time I found much Employment, (and
very fuitable alfo to the Time) for I found great
Occafion of many things which I had no way to
furnifh myfelf with, but by hard Labour and con-
ftant Application ; particularly, I try'd many Ways
to make myfelf a Basket, but all the Twigs I
could get for the Purpofe prov'd fo brittle, that
they would do nothing. It prov'd of excellent Ad-
vantage to me now, that when I was a^Boy, I
ufed to take great Delight in Handing at a Basket-
maker's in the Town where my Father liv'd, to
fee them make their IViakey-ware ; and. being, as
Boys ufually are, very officious to help, and a
great Obferver of the Manner how they work'd
thofe things, and fometimes lending a Hand, I
had by this means full Knowledge of the Methods
of it, that I wanted nothing but the Materials ;
when it came into my Mind, that the Twigs of
that Tree from whence I cut my Stakes that grew,
might
Wil/o-ws, and Often in England, and I refolv'd
to try.
Accordingly the next Day I went to my Coun-
try-Houfe, as I call'd it, and cutting fome of the
fmaller Twigs, I found them to my Purpofe as
lnuch as I could defire; whereupon I came the next.
time prepar'd with a Hatchet to ait down a
Quantity, which I foon found, for there was great
Plenty of them : thefe I fet up to dry within my
Circle or Hedge, and when they were fit for Ufe,
I carried them to my Cave ; and here during the
next Seafon, I employ'd myfelf in making, as well
CK I could, a great many Baskets, both to carry
Earth, or to carry or lay up/any thing as I had oc-
cafion; and tho' I did not finifh them very hand-
fomly, yet I made them fufficiently ferviceable for
my Purpofe ; and thus afterwards I took care ne-
ver to be without them • and as my Wicker. ware
decay'd, 1 made more, efpecially I made ftrong
deep Baskets to place my Corn in, inftead of Sacks,
when I fhould come to have any Quantity of it.
Having mafter'd this Difficulty, and employ 'A
ft world of Time about it, I beftir'd myfelf ro fee
if poffible, how to fupply two Wants : I had no
Veflels to hold any thing that was Liquid, ex-
cept two Runlets which were almoft full of Rum,
and fome Glafs Bottles, fgrne of the common Size,
and others which were Cafe-Bottles fquare, for1
the holding of Waters, Spirits, &c. I had not fo
much as a Pot to boil any thing, except a great
Kettle which I fav'd out of the Ship, and which
^as too big for fuch Ufe as I defir'd it, viz;, to
make Broth, and ftew a Bit of Meat by itfelfv,
The fecond thing I would fain have'had, was 3
Tobacco-Pipe; but it was fmpoffible to me to
make
make one; however I found a Contrivance for
that too at laft.
1 employ'd myfelf in planting my fecond Rows
of Stakes or Piles, and in this Wicker working ail
the Summer, or dry Sealbn, when another Bufi-
nefs took me up more Time than it could be ima-
.gin'd I could fpare.
I mention'd before, that I had a great Mind to
fee the whole Ifland, and that I had travell'd up
the Brook, and fo on to where I built my Bower,
and where I had an Opening quite to the Sea on
the other Side of the Ifland•• I now refolv'd to
travel quite crofs to the Sea-fhore on that Side:
fo taking my Gun, a Hatofaet, and my Dog, and
a larger Quantity of Powder and Shot than ufual,
with two Bisket-Cakes, and a great Bunch of
Raifins in my Pouch for my Store, I began my
Journey ; when i had pafs'd the Vale where my
Bower flood, as above, I came within View of
the Sea, to the Weft, and it being a very clear Day,
1 fairly defcry'd Land, whether an Ifland or a Con-
tinent, I could not tell; but it lay very high, ex-
tending from the Weft to the IV. S. W. at a very
great Diftance ; by my Guefs it could not be lefs
than fifteen or twenty Leagues off.
1 could not tell what Part of the World this
might be, otherwife than that I know it muft be
Par! of America ; and as I concluded by all my
Obfervations, muft be near the Spanijh Dominions,
and perhaps was all inhibited by Savages, where
ifvi.fhould have landed, I had been in a worfe
Condition than I was now; and therefore I ac-
quiefced in the Difpofitions of Providence, which
I began now to own, and to believe, order'd eve-
ry thing for the beft ; I fay, 1 quieted my Mind
with this, and left afflicting myfelf with fruitlefs
Wifhes of being there.
EeSdes
Beficks, after fome Paufe upon this Affair, t
confider'd, that if this Land was the Sfanijh Coaftj
I fhould certainly, one Time or Other, fee fome
Veflel pafs or re-pafs one Way or other ; but if nork
then it was the Savage Coaft between the Sfanijh
Country and Brafih> which were indeed the worft
of Savages; for they are Cannibals, Of Men-eaters,
and fail not to murther and devour all the humane
Bodies that fall into their Hands.
With thefe Considerations I walk'd very leifurc-
ly forward. I found that Side of the Ifland where
I now was, much pleafanter than mine, the open
or Savana Fields fweet, adorn'd with Flowers and
Grafs, and full of very,fine Woods. I faw Abun-
dance of Parrots, and fain I would have caught one^
if poffible, to have kept it to be tame, and taught
it to fpeak to me. I did, after fome PainS taking;
catch a young Parrot, for I knock'd it down with
a Stick, and having recover'd it, I brought it home;
but it was fome Years before I could make him
fpeak : However, at laft I taught him to call me
by my Name very familiarly : But the Accident
that follow'd, tho' it be a Trifle, will be very di-
verting in its Place.
I was exceedingly diverted with this Journey: I
found in the low Grounds Hares, as I thought
them to be, and Foxes, but they differ'd greatly
from all the other Kinds I had met with; nor could
.1 fatisfy myfelf to eat them, tho' I kill'd feveral :
But I had no need to be venturous ; for I had no
Want of Food, and of that which was very good
too ; efpecially thefe three Sorts, viz.. Goats, Pid*
geons, and Turtle or Tortoife; which, added to my
Granes, Lea Jen-hall Market could not have fur-
nifh'd a Table better than I, in Proportion torhev
Company; and tho' my Cafe was deplorable
enough, yet I had great Caufe for Thankfulnefs.
ana
but rather Plenty, even to Dainties.
I never travel'd in this Journey above two Miles
outright in a. Day, or thereabouts; but I took fd
many Turns and Returns to fee what Difcoveries
I could maks^hat I came weary enough to the
Place whereVrefolved to fit down for all Night;
and then 1 either repos'd myfelf in a Tree, or fur-
rounded myfelf with a Row of Stakes fet upright
in the Ground, either frdm one Tree to another,
Or fo as no wild Creature could come at me, with-
out waking me.
As foon as I came to the Sea-fhore, I was "fur-
prized to fee that I had taken up my Lot on the
worfl fide of the Ifland; for here indeed the Shore
was cover'd with innumerable Turtles? whereas
on the other fide I had found but three in a Year.
and half. Here was alfo an infinite number of"
Fowls, of many Kinds, fome which I had feen, and
fome which i had not feen of before, and many of
them very good Meat; but fuch as I knew not
the Names of; except thofe call'd Penguins.
I could have fhot as many as I pleas'd, but was
very fparing of my Powder and Shot; and there-
fore had more Mind to kill a She-Goat, if I could,
which I could better feed on: and tho' there
were many Goats here more than on my Side the
Ifland, yet it was with much more Difficulty that .
I could come near them, the Country being flat
and even, and they faw me much fooher than
when I was on the Hill.
I confefs this Side of the Country was much
pleafanter than mine, but yet I had not the l£aft Fn- ,
clination to remove; for as I .was fix'd in my Ha-
bitation, it became natural to me, and I feem'd all
the while I was here, to be..s it were upon a Jour-
her, and from Home: However, I travel'd along
K th*
the Shore of the Sea, towards the Eaft, I fuppofc
about. twelve Miles j and then fetting up a great
tole upon the Shore for a Mark, I concluded I
would go Home again; and that the next Journey
I took Ihould be on the other Side of the ifland,
Eaft from my Dwelling, and fo roimd till I came
to my Poft again : Of which in iOTPlace.
I took another Way to come back than that I
went, thinking I could eafily keep all the Ifland fo
much in my View, that I could not mifs finding
my firfl Dwelling by viewing the Country; but I
found myfelf miftaken; for being come about two
or three Miles, I found myfelf defcended into a
very large Valley; but fo furrounded with Hills,
and thofe Hills covered with Wood, that I could
not fee which was my Way by any Direction but
that of the Sun, nor even then, unlefs I knew very
well the Polition of the Sun at that time of the
Day.
It happen'd, to my farther Misfortune, that
.the Weather prov'd hazey for three or four Days,
while I was in this Valley; and not being able to
fee the Sun, I wander'd about very uncomfortably,
and at laft was obliged to find out the Sea-fide,
Jook for my Poft, and come back the fame Way
J went; and then by eafy Journeys I turn'd home-
ward, the Weather being exceeding hot, and my
Gun, Ammunition, Hatchet, and other things
very heavy.
In this journey my Dog furpriz'd a young Kid,
and feiz'd upon it, and I running in to take ^old
of it, caught it, and fav'd it alive from the Dog :
I had a great mind to bring it Home if I could ;
for I had often been mufing, whether it might not
be pofllb'e to get a Kid or two, and fo raife a
Breed of tame Goats, which might fupply me when
my Powder and Shot fhould be ail fpent.
'"
I made a Collar to this little Creature, and with
a String which I made or fome Rope-Yarn which
I always carry'd about me, I led him alongj tho*
with fome Difficulty, till I came to my Bower,
and there I enclos'd him, and left him; tor I was
Very impatient to be at Home, from whence I had
been abfent above a Month.
I cannot exprefs what a Satisfa&ion it was to
me, to come into my old Hutchj and lie down in
my Hamock-Bed : This little wandring Journeyi
without fettled Place of Abode, had been fo un-
pleafant to me, that my own Houfe* as I call'd it
to myfelf, was a perfect Settlement to me, com-
par'd to that; and it render'd every thing about
toe fo comfortable, that I refolv'd I would never
go a great Way from it again, while it fhould be
my Lot to ftay on the Ifland.
I repos'd myfelf here a Week, to reft and regale
myfelf after my long Journey; during which, moft
of the Time was taken up in the weighty Affair of
making a Cage for my Po.l, who began now to be
a meer Domeftick, and to be mighty well acquain-
ted with me. Then I began to think of the poor
Kid, which I had penn'd in within my little Cir-
cle, and refolv'd to go and fetch it Home, or giv£
it fome Food ; accordingly I went, and found it
where I left it; for indeed it could not get 6ut*
but almoft ftarv'd for want of Food : I went and
cut Bows of Trees, and Branches of fuch Shrubs
as I co'ild.find, and threw it over, and having fed
it, I ty'd it as I did before, to lead it away; but
it was fo tame with being hungry, that I had nd
need to have ty'd it; for it follow'd me like d
Dog ; and as I continually fed it, the Creature be*
came fo loving, fo gentle, and fo fond, that it be-
came from that time one of my Domeftkks alfo,
and would never leave me afterwards,
K a Th«
now come, and 1 kept the 3oth of September in the
fame folemn manner as before, being the Anniver-
fary of my Landing on the Jfland, having now been
there two Years, and no more Profpect of being de-
liver'd than the firft Day I came there. 1 fpent the
whole Day in humble and thankful Acknowledg-
ments of the many wonderful Mercies which my fo-
litary Condition was attended with, and without
which it might have been infinitely more miferable.
I gave humble and hearty Thanks that God had
been pleafed to difcover to me, even that it was
poffible I might be more happy in this folitary
Condition, than I fhould have been in a Liberty of
Society, and in all the Pieafures of the World. That
He could fully make up to me the Deficiencies of
my folitary State, and the want of Humane So-
ciety, by his Prefence, and the Communications of
his Grace to my Soul, fupporting, comforting, and
encouraging me to depend upon his Providence
here, and hope for his Eternal Prefence hereafter.
It was now that I began fenfibly to feel how
much more happy this Life 1 now led was, with
all its miferable Circumftances, than the wicked,
curfed, abominable Life .1 led all the paft part of
my Days; and now I changed both my Sorrows
and my Joys; my very Defires alter'd, my Affe-
ctions changed their Gufts, and my Delights were
perfectly new, from what they were at my firft
coming, or indeed for the two Years paft.
• Before, as I walk'd about, either on my Hunt-
ing, or for viewing the Country, the Anguifh of
my Soul at my Condition, would break out upon
me on a fudden, and my very Heart would die
within me, to think.of the Woods, the Mountains,
the Defarts I was in ; and how I was a Prifoner
lock'd up with the Eternal Bars and Bolts of the
Ocean,
Ocean, in an uninhabited Wildernefs, without Re-
demption : "In the midft of the greateft Compofbres
of my Mind, this would break out upon me like a
Storm, and make me wring my Hands, and weep
like a Child: Sometimes it would take me in the
middle of my Work, arid I would immediately fit
down and figh, and look upon the Ground for an
Hour or two together; and this was ftill worfe to
me ; for if i could burft out into Tears, or vent
. myfelf by Words, it would go off, and the Grief
having exhaufted itfelf, would abate. ^
But now I began to exercife myfelf with new
Thoughts; I daily read the Word of God, and ap-
ply'd all the Comforts of it to my prefent State.
One Morning being very fad, I open'd the Bible
upon thefe Words, 7 -will never, never leave thee, nor
Jorfake tbee; immediately it occur'd, that tliefe
Words were to me, why elfe fhould they be di-
rected in fuch a Manner, juft at the Moment when
I was mourning -over my Condition, as one tbr-
faken of God and Man ? Well then, faid I, .if
God does not forfake me, of what ill Confequence
can it be, or what matters it, tho' the World
fhould all forfake me, feeing on the other hand, if
I had all the World, and fhould lofe the Favour.
and Blefling of God, there wou'd be no Compa-
rifon in the Lofs.
From this Moment I began to conclude in my
Mind, that it was poflible for me to be more
happy in this forfaken folitary Condition, th n it
was probable I fhould ever have been in any other
particular State in the Worid ; and with -this
Thought I was going to give Thanks to God for
bringing me to this Place.
I know not what it was, but fomething fhock'd
my Mind at that Thought, and I durft not fr-eak
the Words: How canft thou'be fuch a Hypo.rite,
K 3 (faid
n Condition, which however thou may'fl endea-
vour to be contented with, thou would'ft rather
pray heartily to be deliver'd from; fo I ftopp'd
there : But tho' 1 could not fay, I thank'd God
for being there 5 yet I fhicerely gave Thanks* to
God for opening my Eyes, by whatever afflicting
Providences, to fee the former Condition of my
Life, and to mourn for my Wickednefs, and repent,
I never open'd the Bible, or fhut it, but my very
Soul within me blefs'd God for directing my Friend
in England, without any Order of mine, to pack it
up among my Goods; and for aflifting me after-
wards to fave it out of the Wreck of the Ship.
Thus, and in this Difpofition of Mind, I began
my third Year: and tho' 1 have not given the Rea-
der the Trovble of fo particular Account of my
Works this Year as the firft; yet in general it
may be obferv'd, that I was very feldom idle;
but having regularly divided my Time, according
to the feveral daily Employments that were before
me, fuch as, f/V/Z, my Duty to God, and the read-:
ing the Scriptures, which I conftantly fet apart
fome time for thrice every Day. Secondly, The going
Abroad with my Gun for FoocT, which generally
took me up three Hours in every Morning, when
it did not Rain. Thirdly, The ordering, curing,
preferving, and cooking what 1 had ki I'd or catch'd
for my Supply ; thefe took up great Part of the
Day: alfo it is to be confider'd that the middle of
the day when the Sun was in the Zenith, the Vio-
lence of the Heat was too great to ftir out; fo that
about four Hours in the Evening was all the time
I could be fupposM to work in ; with this Excep-
tion, that fometimes I chang'd my Hours of
Hunting and Working, and went to work in the
Morning.,
Morning, and Abroad wich my Gun in the After-
noon.
To this fhort time allow'd for Labour, I defire
may be added the exceeding Laborioufnefs of my
* Work, the many Hours which for want of Tools,
want of Help, and want of Skill, every thing I
did, took up out of my Time : For Example, I
was full two and forty days making me a Board
for a long Shelf, which I wanted in my Cave;
whereas two Sawyers with their Tools, and a Saw-
Pit would have cut fix of them out of the lame
Tree in half a day.
My Cafe was this; it was to be a large Tree
which was to be cut down, becaufe my Board was
to be a broad one. This Tree I was three days
a cutting down, and two more cutting oft the
Bows, and reducing it to a Log, or Piece of Tim-
ber. With inexpieffible hacking and hewing t
reduced both the Sides of it into Chips, till it be-
gun to be light enough to move; then I turn'd it,
and made one fide of it fmooth, and flat, as a.
Board from End to End ; then turning that fide
downward, cut the other fide, till I brought the
Plank to be about three Inches thick, and fmooth
on both fides. Any one may judge the Labour of
my Hands in fuch a piece of Work; but Labour
and Patience carry'd me thro' that and many
other things: T. only obferve this in particular, to
fhew the Reafon why fo much of my time went
away with fo little Work, viz,. that what might
be a little to be done with Help and Tools, was a
vaft Labour, and requir'd a prodigious time to do
alone, and by hand. . *
Bnt notwithstanding this, with Patience and La-
bour I went thro' many things, and indeed every
thing that my Circumftances made neceflary to me
to do, as will appear by what follows.
K 4 I was
ctmber, expecting my Crop of Barley and Rice.
The Ground I had manur'd or dug up for them
was not great; for as I obferv'd, my Seed of each
was not above the Quantity of half a Peck;
for I had loft one whole Crop by fowiug in the
dry Seafon; but now my Crop promis'd very well,
when on a fudden 1 found I was in Danger of
lofing it all again by Enemies of feveral forts,
which it was fcarce poffible to keep from it; as.
firft, the Goats, and wi!d Creatures which I call'd
Hares, who tafting the Sweetnefs of the Blade,
lay in it Night and Day, as fopn as it came up,
and eat it fo clofe, that it could get no time to
{hpot up into Stalk.
This I faw no Remedy for, but by making an
' Enclofure about it with a Hedge, which I did
with a great deal of Toil; and the more, becaufe
it requir'd Speed. However, as my Arable Land
was but fmall, fuited to my Crop, .' got it totally.
well fenced in about three Weeks time; and {hoot-
ing feme of the Creatures in the Day time, I fet
my Dpg to guard it in the Night, tying him up to
«. a Stake at the Gate, where he would Hand and
bark all Night Ipng; fo in a little time the Enemies
fprfook the Place, and the Corn grew very ftrong,
and well, and began to ripen apace.
But as the Beafls ruined me befpre, while my
.. Corn was in the Blade, fo the Birds were as likely.
to ruine me now, when it was in the Ear; for go-
ing along by the Place to fee how it throve, I faw
my little Crop furrounded with Fowls of I know
not how many forts, who flood as it were watch-
ing till I fhould be gone : I 'immediately let fly
among them (for I always had my Gun with me.)
1 had no fooner fhot but there rofe up a little
Qoud.
among the Corn it feit.
Tnis touiu'd me teuliMy, for I forefaw, that in
a few l>ays they would devour all my Hopes, that
J fhould b£ ftarv'd, and never be able to raife a
Crop at alij and what to do I could not tell: How-
ever, I refolv'd not to lofe my Corn, if ppfEble,
fho? I fhould watch it Night and Day. In the
firft Place, I went among it to fee what Darrtage
was already done, and found they had fpoil'd a
good deal of it ; but that as it was yet too green
for them, the Lofs was not fo great, but that the
Remainder was iike to be a good Crop if it could
be fav'd.
I {laid by it to load my Gun, and then coming
away I could eafily fee the Thieves fitting upon all
the Trees about me, as if they only waited till I
was gone away, and the Event proved it to be fo;
for as I walk'd off as if I was gone, I was no {oon-
er out of their Sight, but they dropt down one by
one into the Corn again. 1 was fo provok'd that I
could not have Patience to ftay till more came on,
knowing that every Grain that they eat now, was,
OA it might be jaid, a Peck-loaf to me in the Confe-
quence ; but coming up to the Hedge, I fir'd a-
gain, and kill'd three of them. This was what I
wjfh'd for; fo I took them up, and ferv'd them as
we ferve notorious Thieves in England, (viz,.)
Hang'd them in Chains fora Terror to others. It
is impoflible to imagine almoft, that this fhould
have fuch an Effect as it had j for the Fowls would
not only not'come at the Corn, but in fhort they ror-
fook all that Part of the Ifland, and I could never
fee a Bird near the Place as long as my Scare-Crows
hung there.
This
This I was very glad of,you maybe fure^and a-
bout the latter end ot December, which was our fe-,
cond Harveft of the Year, 1 reap'd my Crop.
I was fadly put to it for a Scythe or a Sickle to
cut it down, and all I could do was to make one as
well as I could out'of one of the broad Swords or
Cutlaiies, which I fav'd among the Arms out of
the Ship. However, as my firft Crop was but fmall,
I had no great Difficulty to cut it down : in fhort,
I reap'd it my way, for I cut nothing off but the
Ears, and carry'd it away in a great Basket which
I had made, and fo rubb'd it out with my Hands;
and at the End of all my Harvefting, I found that
out of my half Peck of Seed, 1 had near two Bu-
fhels of Rice, and above two Bufhels and half of
Barley, that is to fay, by my Guefs, for I had no
Meafure at that time.
However, this was a great Encouragement to
me ; and I forefaw that in time, it would pleafe
God to fupply me with Bread : And yet here I
was perplex'd again, for I neither knew how to
grind or make Meal of my Corn, or indeed how
to clean it and part it; nor if made into Meal, how.
to make Bread of it; and if how to make it, yet I
knew not how to bake it: thefe things being added
to my Defire of having a good Quantity for Store,
and to fecure a conftant Supply, I refolv'd not to
tafte any of this Crop, but to preferve it all for Seen
againft the next Seafon, and in the mean time to
employ all my Study and Hours of working to ac-
complifh this great Work of providing myfelf with
Corn and Bread.
It might be truly faid, that now I work d tor
my Bread. "Tis a little wonderful, and what I be-
lieve few People have thought much upon, (viz,.) the
ftrange Multitude of little things nectary nvthe

I that was reduced to a meer State of Nature,
found this to my daily Diicouragement, and was
made more arrd more fenfible of it every Hour, even
after I had got the tirft Handful of Seed-Corn,
which, as I have faid, came up unexpectedly, and
indeed to a Surprife.
Firft, I had no Plow to turn up the Earth, no
Spade or Shovel to dig it. Well, this I conquer'd,
by making a wooden Spade, as I obferv'd before j
but this did my Wo.k in but a wooden manner j
and tho' it coft me a great many Days to make it,
yet for want of Iron it not only wore out the {bon-
er, but made my Work the harder, and made it
be perform'd much worfe.
However, this I bore wiih, and was content to
work it out with Patience, and bear with the Bad-
nefs of the Performance. When the Corn was
fow'd, I had no Harrow, but was forced to go
over it my felf, and drag a great heavy Bough of a
Tree over it, to Scratch it, as it may be call'd, ra-
ther than Rake or Harrow it.
When it was growing and grown, I have ob-
ferv'd already how many things I wanted, to
fence it, fecure it, mow or reap it, cure\ and
carry it Home, thrafh, part it from the Chi'ff,
attd fave it, Then I wanted a Mill to grind it,
Sieves to drefs it, Yeaft and Salt to make it into
Bread, and an Oven .to bake it; and yet all thefe
things I did without, as fhall be obferv'd ; and
yet the Corn was an ineftimable Comfort and Ad-
vantage to me too. All this, as I faid, made
every thing laborious and tedious to me, but thac
there was no help for; neither was my time f<*
much Lofs to me, becaufe as I had divided ir, a
certain Par? of it was every Day appointed to
thefe
' Corn for Bread till I had a greater Quantity by
me, I had the next fix Months to apply myfelf
wholly by Labour and Invention to furnim myfelf;
with Utenfils proper for the performing all the Q-
perations neceflary for the making the Corn (when,
I had it) fit for my ufe.
But rirft, I was to prepare more Land, for I
had now Seed enough to fow above an Acre of
Ground. Before I did this', I had a Weeks-work
at leaft to make me a Spade, which when it was
done was but a forty one indeed, and very heavy,
and requir'd double Labour to work with it;
^owever I went thro' that, and fow'd my Seed in
two large flat Pieces of Ground, as near my
Houle as I could find them to my Mind, and
fenc'd them in with a good Hedge, the Stakes of
which were all cut of that Wood which I had fet
before, and knew it would grow, fo that in one
Year's time I knew I fhould have a Quick or Li^
ving.Hedge, that would want but little Repair.
This Work was not fo little as to take me up lefs
than three Months, becaufe great Part of that time
was of the wet Seafon, when I could not go a-
broad.
Within Doors, that z>, when it rained, and \
could not go out, I found Employment on the fol-
lowing Occafions ; always obferving, that all the
while I was at work I diverted myfelf with talk-
' ing to my Parrot, and teaching him to Speak ;
and I quickly learned him to know his own Name,
and at laft to fpeak it out pretty loud, POLL,
which was the firft Word I ever heard fpoken in
the Ifland by any Mouth but my own. This
therefore was not'my Work, but an Afliftant" to my
Work; for now, as I faid, I had a great Employ-
ment upon my Hands, as follows^ (vi%.) I M
Ion5
Ibng ftudyM, by fome Means or other, to make
myfelffome Earthen Veflels, which indeed I want-
ed forely, but knew not where to come at them:
However, conlidering the Heat of the Climate, I
did not doubt but if I could find out any fuch
Clay, I might botch up fome fuch Pot, as might4
being dry'd in'theSun, be hard enough, and ftrong
enough to bear handling, and to hold any Thing
that was dry, and required to be kept fo ; and
as this was neceflary in the preparing Corn,
Meal, &c. which was the Thing I was upon, I
refolved to make fome as large as I could, and fit
only to ftand like Jars to hold what fhould be put
into them.
It would make the Reader pity me, or rather
laugh at me* to tell how many awkward Ways I
took to raife this Pafte, what odd mimapen ugly
things I made, how many of them fell in, and how.
many fell out, the Clay not being ftirT enough to
bear its own Weight ; how many crack'd by the •
over violent Heat of the Sun, being fet out too
haftily ; and how many fell in Pieces with only re-
moving, as well before as after they were dry'd ;
and in a word, how after having laboured hard
to find the Clay, to dig it, to temper it, to bring
it home and work it, I could not make above two
large earthen ugly things, 1 cannot call them Jarrs,
in about two Months Labour.
However, as the Suntkik'd thefe two very dry
and hard, I lifted them very gently up, and fee
them down again in two great Wicker-Baskets^
which I had made on purpofe for them, that 'they
might not break ; and as between the Pot and the
Basket there was a little room to fpare, I fiuff'd it
full of the Rice and Barley Straw, and thefe two
Pots being to ftand always dry, I thought would
hold
% '. .1 ;
hold my dry Corn, and perhaps the Meal, whert
the Corn was bruifed.
Tho' I mifcarried fo much in my Defign for
large Pots, yet I made feveral fmaller things with
better Succefs; fuch as little round Pots, flat Difh.'
es, Pitchers and Pipkins, and any things my Hand
turn'd to, and the Heat of the Sun bak'd them
ftrangely hard. ,
But all this would not anfwer my End, which
was to get an Earthen Pot to hold what was Li-
quid, and bear the Fire, which none of thefe could
do. It happen'd after fome time, making a pretty
large Fire for Cooking my Meat, when I went to
put it out after I had done with it, I found a bro-
ken Piece of one of my Earthen-ware Veflels in the
Fire, burnt as hard as a Stone, and red as a Tile,
I was agreeably furpriz'd to fee it, and faid to my
felf, that certainly they might be made to burn
whole, if they would burn broken.
This fet me to fludying how to order my Fire*
fo as to make it burn me fome Pots. I had no
notion of a Kiln, fuch as the Potters burn in, or
of glazing them with Lead, tho* I had fome Lead
to do it-with ; but I plac'd three large Pipkins,
and two or three Pots in a Pile one upon another,
and plac'd my Fire-wood all round it with a great
Heap of Em' ers under them ; I ply'd the Fire
with frefh Fuel round the out-fide, and upon the
top, till I faw the Pots in the infide red hot quite
thro', and obferv'd that they did not crack at all;
when I faw them clear red, I let them {land in
that Heat about y or 6 Hours, till I found one of
them, tho' it did not crack, did melt or run, foif
the Sand which was mixed with the Clay melted
by the Violence of rhe Heat, and would have run
into Glafs if I had gone on; fo I flack'd my Fire
gradually, till the Pots began to abate of the red
Colour, and watching them all Night, that I might
not let the Fire abate too faft, in the Morning I
had three very good, 1 will not fay handfome Pip-
kins , and two other Earthen Pots, as hard burnt
as could be denVd ; and one of them perfectly
glaz'd with the Running of the Sand.
After this Experiment, I need not fay that I
wanted no fort of Earthen Ware for my Ufe; buC
I muft needs fay, as to the Shapes of them, they
were very indifferent, as any one may fuppofe,when
1 had no way of making them, but as the Children
make Dirt-Pyes, or as a Woman would make Pye$
that never learnt to raife Pafte.
No Joy at a thing of fo mean a Nature was
ever equal to mine, when I found I had made an
Earthen Pot that would bear the Fire ; and I had
hardly Patience to flay till they were cold, before
I fet one upon the Fire again, with fome Water in
it, to boil me fome Meat, which it did admirably
well ; and with a Piece of a Kid I made fome very
good Broth, though 1 wanted Oatmeal, and feve-
ral other Ingredients requifite to make it fo good
as I would have had it been.
My next Concern was, to get me a Stone Mor-
tar to ftamp or beat fome Corn in ; for as to the
Mill, there was no thought at arriving to that Per-
fection of Art, with one Pair of Hands. To fup-
p!y this Want I.was at a great Lofs ; for of all
Trades in the World I was as perfectly unqualified
for a Stone-Cutter, as for any whatever; neither had
1 any Tools to go about it with. 1 fpent many a
Day to find out a great Stone big enough to .cut
hollow, and make fit for a Mortar, and could find
none at all ; except what was in the folid Rock,
and which I had no way to dig or cut out ; nor in-
deed were the Rocks in the Ifland of Hardnefs fuf-
ficient, but were all of a fandy crumbling Stone,
which
which would neither bear the Weight of a heavy
Peftle, or would break the Corn without filling it
Vith Sand ; fo after a great deal of Time loft in
Searching for a Stone, I gave it over, and refolv'd
to look out for a great Block of hard Wood, which
1 found indeed much eafier; and getting one as
big as I had Strength to ftir, I rounded it, and
form'd it on the Outfide with my Axe and Hatcher;
and then with the Help of Fire and infinite Labour;
made a hollow Place in it, as the Indians in Brafil
make their Games. After this, I made a great hea-
yy Peftle or Beater, of the Wood call'd the Ironr
Wood, and this I prepared and laid by againft I
had my next Crop of Corn, when I propos'd to
myfelf to grind, or rather pound, my Corn into
Meal to make my Bread.
My next Difficulty was to make a Sieve, or
Search, to drefs my Meal, and to part it from the
Bran, and the Husk, without which I did not fee
it poffible I could have any Bread. This was a
moft difficult thing, fo much as but to think on ;
For to be fure I had nothing like the necefl'ary thing
to make it; I mean fine thin Canvas, or Stuff to
fearch the Meal through. And here I was at a full
Stop for many Months ; nor did I really know
what to do j Linnen I had none left, but what was
meer Rags ; I had Goats Hair, bat neither knew
I how to weave it, or fpin it; and had I known
how, here was no Tools to work it with ; all the
Remedy that I found for this, was, That at laft I
did remember I had among the Seamens Cloaths
which werefav'd out of the Ship, fome Neckcloths
of Ca'licoe or Muflin ; and with fome Pieces of
thefe.l made three fmall Sieves, but proper enough
for the Work; and thus I made Cbift for fome Years $
how I did afterwards, I fhallfhewjn its Place.
The
The baking Part was the next thing to be con-
fider'd, and how I mould make Bread when Icame
to have Corn ; for firft I had no Yeaft ,- as to that
Part, as there was no fupplymg the Want, fo 1 did
not concern my felf much about it : But for an
Ovehi I was indeed in great Pain : at length I
found out an Experiment tor that alfo, which was
this; I made fome Earthen Veffels very broad, but
riot deep ; that is to fay, about two Foot Diame-
ter, and not above nine Inches deep : thefe I burnt
in the Fire, as I had done the other, and laid them
By; and when I wanted to bake, I made a great
Fire upon my Hearth, which I had pav'd with
fome fquare Tiles of my own making and burning
alfo; but I mould not call them fquare.
._ When the Fire-wood was burnt pretty much intb
Embers, or live Coals, I drew themforward upon
this Hearth, fo as to cover it all over, and there I
let them lie, till the Hearth was very hot; theri
fweeping away all the Embers, I fet down my
Loaf, or Loaves, and whelming down the Earthen
Pot upon them, drew the Embers all round the
Outfide of the Pot, to keep in, and add to the
Heat ; and thus, as well as in the belt Oven in the
World, I bak'd my Barley-Loaves, and became in
little time a meer Paftry-Ccbk into the Bargain ;
for I made myfelf feveral Cakes of the Rice and
Puddings ; indeed I made no Pies, neither had I any
Thing to put into them, fuppofing I had, except
the Fleih either of Fowls or Goats.
It need riot be wondered at, if* alj thefe things
took me up moft Part of the third Year of my A-
bode here ; for it is to be obferv'd, That in the In-
tervals of thefe Things, I had my new Harveft and
Husbandry to manage; for I reap'd my Corn in its
Seafori, and carried it Home as well as I could, and
hid it Up in the Ear, in my large Baskets, till I hacl
L Tiftic
it on, or Inftrument to thrafh it with.
And now indeed my Stock of Corn increafing, I
really wanted to build my Barns bigger : I wanted a
Place to 'ay it up in ; for the Increafe of the Corn
now yielded me fo much, that I had of the Barley
about twenty Bufhels, and of the Rice as much,
or mo; e, inibmuch, that now I refolv'd to begin
to ufe it freely ; for m.y Bread had been quite gone
a grcat'while ; alfo 1 refolv'd to fee what Quanti-
ty would be fufficient for me a whole Year, and to
fow but once a Year.
Upon the whole, I found that the forty Bufhels
of Barley and Rice was much more than I could
con fume in a Year; fo I refolv'd to fow juft the fame
.Quantity every Year that I fowed the laft, in hopes
that fitch a Quantity would fully provide me with
Bread, &c.
All the while thefe Things were doing, you may
be fure my Thoughts run many times upon the
Profpect of Land which I had feert from the other
Side of the Ifland, and I was not without fecret
Wifhes that I were on Shore there, fancy ing the fee-
ing the main Land, and in an inhabited Country,
I might find fome Way or other to convey my
felf farther, and perhaps at laft find fome Means of
Efcape. ,
But all this while I made no Allowance for the
Bangers of fuch a Condition, and how I might fall
into the Hands of Savages, and perhaps fuch as I
might have Reafon to think far worfe than the Li-
ons and Tigers of Africa. That if I once came in-
to their Power, I fhould run a Hazard more than a
Thoufand to One of being kill'd, and perhaps of be-
ing eaten; for 1 had heard that the People of the Car-
ribean Coafts were Cannibals, or Man-eaters ; and
I knew by the Latitude, that I could not be far oft
from
nibals, yet that they might kill me, as many Euro*
feans who had fallen into their Hands had been fer-
ved, even when they had been ten or twenty toge-
ther ; much more I that was but one, and could
make little or no Defence. All thefe things, I fay,
which i ought to have confider'd well of, and did
caft up in my Thoughts afterwards, yet took up
none of my Apprehenfions at firft ; but my Head
run mightily upon the Thought of getting over to
the Shore.
Now I wifh'd for my Boy Xuryy and the Long-
Boat with the bhoulder of Mutton Sail, with which
I fail'd above a thoufand Miles on the Coaft of A"
frick; but this was in vain. Then I thought I would
go and look at our Ship's Boat, which, as I have
laid, was blown up upon the Shore a great Way in
the Storm, when we were firft caft away. She lay
almoft where ffie did at firft, but not quite ; and
was turn'd by the Force of the Waves and the
Winds, almoft Bottom upward, againft a high
Ridge of Beachy rough Sand; but no Water abouc
her as before.
If I had had Hands to have refitted her, and to
have launch'd her inttf the Water, the Boat would
have done well enough, and I might have gone
back into the Brajtls with her eafily enough • but I
might have foreieen, that I could no more turn her, .
and fet her upright upon her Bottom, than I could
remove the Ifland : However, I went to the
Woods and cut Levers and Rollers, and brought
them to the Boat, refolv'd to try what I could do j
fuggefting to myfelf, that if 1 could but turn hec
down, I might eafily repair the Damage fhe had
receiv'd, and {he would be a very good Boat, and
1 might go to Sea in her very eafily.
I fp.ir'd no Pains indeed, in.this Piece of fniitlefs
Toil, and fpentj I think, three or four Weeks a-
L a bout
with my little Strength, 1 fell to digging away the
Sand to undermine it, and foto make it fall down;
fetting Pieces of Wood to thruft and guide it right
in the Fall.
But when I had done this, I was unable to ftir it
up again, or to get under it, much lefs to move it
forward towards the Water; fo I was forc'd to give
it over; and yet, though I gave over the Hopes of
the Boat, my defire to venture over for the Main
increafed, rather than decreafed, as the Means for
it feem'd impoflible.
This at length put me upon thinking, Whether
it was not poffible to make myfelf a Came, or Peria-
gua, fuch as the Natives of thofe Climates make,
even without Tools, or, as 1 might fay, without
Hands, •viz.. of the Trunk of a great Tree. This I
not only thought poflible, but eafy, and pleas'd
myfelf extreamly with the Thoughts of rasking it,
and with my having much more Convenience for it
than any of the Negroes or Indians j but not at all
confidering the particular Inconveniences .which I
lay under, more than the Indians did, viz,. Want of
Hands to move it, when it was made, into the Wa-
ter ; a Difficulty much harder for me to furmount,
than all the Confequences of want of Tools could
be to them : For what was it to me, That when I
had chofen a vaft Tree in the Woods, I might with
much Trouble cut it down, if after I might be a-
ble with my Tools to hew and dub the Out fide
into the proper Shape of a Boat, and burn or cut
out the Infide to make it hollaw, fo to make a Boat
of it, if after all this, I muft leave it juft there
where I found it, and was not able to launch it in-
to the Water.
One would have thought, I could not have had
the leaft Reflection upon my Mind of my Circum-
ftance,
ftance, while I was making this Boat, but I mould
have immediately thought how I fhould get it into
the Sea ; but my Thoughts were fo intertt upon
my Voyage over the Sea in it, that I never once
confider'd how I mould get it oft' of the Land ;
and it was really in its own Nature more eafy tor
me to guide it over forty five Miles of Sea, than
about forty five Fathom of Land, where it lay, to
fet it a float in the Water.
I went to work upon this Boat the moft like a
Fool that ever Man did, who had any of his Scales
awake. I pleas'd myfelf with the Defign, wtth-
out determining whether I was ever able to under-
take it; not but that the Difficulty of launching
my Boat came often into my Head; but I put a
flop to my own Enquiries into it, by this foolifh
Anfwer which I gave myfelf, Let's firft make it, Vll
•warrant I'll find fome Way or other toget it along, when
'tis done.
'• This was a moft prepofterous Method ; but the
Eagernefs of my Fancy prevail'd, and to work I
went. I fell'd a Cedar Tree : I queftion much
whether Solomon ever had fuch a one for the Build-
ing of the Temple at Jerufalem. It was five Foot
ten Inches Diameter at the lower Part next the
Stump, and four Foot eleven Inches Diameter ^c
the End of twenty two Foot, after which it lef-
fen'd for a while, and then parted into Branches :
It was not without infinite Labour that I fell'd
this Tree: I was twenty Days hacking and hew-
ing at it at the Bottom. I was fourteen more get-
ting the Branches and Limbs, and the vaft fpread-
ing Head of it cut off, which I haclc'd and hew'd
through with Axe and Hatchet, and inexpreflible
Labour: After this, it coft me a Month to fhapd
it, and dub it to a Proportion, and to fomething
like the Bptcom of a Boat, that it might fwim up-
L 3 right
right as it ought to do. It coft me near three
Months more to clear the Infide, and work it out
fo, as to make an exact Boat of it: This I did in-
deed without Fire, by mere Mallet and Chiffel, and
by the dint of hard Labour, till 1 had brought it to
be a very handfome Penagua, and big enough to
have carried fix and twenty Men, and confequently
big enough to have carried me and all my Cargo.
When I had gone through this Work, I was ex-
tremely delighted with it. The Boat was really
much bigger than I ever faw a Canoe, or Periagua^
that was made of one Tree, in my Life. Many a
weary Stroke it had coft, you may be fure ; and
there remained nothing but to get it into theWater;
and had I gotten it into the Water,.I make no que-
ftion, but 1 fhould have began the maddeft Voyage
and the moil unlikely to be perform'd, that ever
vyas undertaken.
" But all my Devices to get it into the Water
fail'd me, though they coft me infinite Labour too.
It lay about one hundred Yards from the Water,
and not more : But the firft Inconvenience was, it
was up Hill towards the Creek : well, to take a-
way this Difcouragement, I refolv'd to dig into
the Surface of the Earth, and fo make a Declivi-
ty : This I begun, and it coft me a prodigious deal
of Pains ; but who grudges Pains, that have! their
Deliverance in View ? But when this was work'd
through, and this Difficulty manag'd, it was ftill
much at one; for I could no more flir the Canoe,
than I could the other Boat.
Then I meafur'd the Diftance of Ground, and
refolv'd to cut a Dock, or Canal, to bring the Wa-
ter np to the Canoe, feeing I could not bring the
Canoe down to the Water : Well, I began this
Work, and when I began to enter into it, and cal-
culate how deep it was to be dug, how broad,
how
the number of Hands I had, being none but my
own, it muft have been ten or twelve Years before
I fhould have gone through with it; for the Shore
lay high, fo that at the upper End it muft have
been at leaft twenty Foot deep; fo at length, tho'
with great Reludancy, I gave this Attempt over
alfo.
This griev'd me heartily, and now I (aw, tho'
too late, the Folly of beginning a Work before we
count the Coft, and before we judge rightly of
our own Strength to go through with it.
In the middle of this Work, 1 fimuYd my fourth
Year in this Place, and kept my Anniverfary with
the fame Devotion, and with as much Comfort as
ever before ; for by a conftant Study, and fcn'ous
Application of the Word of God, and by the Af-
fiftance of his Grace, I gain'd different Know-
ledge from what I had before. 1 entertain'd diffe-
rent Notions of things. 1 look'd now upon the
World as a thing remote, which I had nothing to
do with, no Expectation from, and indeed no De-
fires about: In a word, I had nothing indeed to
do with it, nor was ever like to have ; fo I thought
it look'd as we may perhaps look upon it hereafter,
•viz,, as a Place I had lived in, but was come out of
it ; and well might I fay, as Father Abraham to
Dives, Between me and thee is a great Gulph fixed.
In the firfl Place, I was removed fiom all the
Wickednefsofthe World here : I had neither the
Luft of the Fle/Jj, the Luft of the Eye, or the Pride of
Life. I had nothing to covet; for I had all that [
was now capable of enjoying : I was Lord of tli-e'
whole Manor; or if I pleas'd, I mi^ht call mykk"
King, or Emperor over the whole Country winch
I had Pofleffion of. There were no Rivals : I' hid'
no Competitor, none to difpute Sovereignty of
L 4 Com-
.'w.
Command with me.. * I might have rais'd Ship
Loadings of Corn; but I had no ufe for it; fo I let
as little grow as I thought enough for my Occafion.
I had Tortoife or Turtles enough; but now and
then one was as much as I could put to any ufe. I
had Timrer enough to have built a Fleet of Ships.
I >had Grapes enough to have made Wine, or to
have ci.r'd into Raifins, to have loaded that Fleet
when the£ had been built.
••» But all I could make ufe of, was, All that was
valuably. I had enough to eat, and to fupply my
Wants, and, what was all the reft to me ? If I
kill'd more Flefh than I could eat, the Dog muft eat
it, or the Vermin. If I fow\i more Corn than I
could eat, it mult be fpoil'd. The Trees that I
cut down, were lying to rot on the Ground : I
Could make no more ufe of them than for Fewei,
and that I had no Occafion for, but to drefs my
Food.
In a Word, the Nature and Experience of
Things dictated to me upon juft Reflection, that
all the good Things of this World, are no farther
good to us, than they are for our Ufe ; and that
whatever we may heap up indeed to give others,
we enjoy juft as much as we can ufe, and no more.
The moft covetous griping Mifer in the World
would have been cured of the Vice of Covetoufnefs,
if he had been in my Cafe • for I pofTefled infinitely
more than I knew what to do with. I had no room.
for Defire, except it was of things which I had
not, and they were but Trifles, tho' indeed of
great ufe to me. I had, as I hinted before, a Par-
cel of Money, as well Gold as Silver, about thirty
fix Pounds Sterling : Alas! there the nafty forry
ufelefs Stuff lay; I had no manner of Bufinefs
for it • and I often thought with myfelf, that I
have given a Handful of it for a Grofs of
Tobacco,-
Tobacco-Pipes, or for a Hand-mill to grind my
Corn; nay, I would have given it all for Sixpenny-
worth of Turnip and Carrot Seed out of England, or
for a Handtul of Peafe and Beam, and a Bottle of
Ink: As it 'Jiast I had not the leaft Advantage by
it, or Benefit from it; but there it lay in a Drawer,
and grew mouldy with the Damp of the Cave, in
the wet Seafon ; and if I had had the Drawer full
of Diamonds, it had been the fame Gale; and
they had been of no manner of Value to me, be-
faufe of no Ufe. V*
I had now brought my State of Life to be much
eafier in itfelf than it was at firft, and much eafier
to my Mind, as well as to my Body. I frequently
fat down to my Meat with Thankfulnefs, and adr-
mired the Hand of God's Providence, which had
thus fpread my Table in the Wildernefs. I learned
to look more upon the bright Side of my Condi-
tion, and lefs upon the dark Side; and to confider
what I enjoy'd, rather than what I wanted ; and
this gave me fometimes fuch fecret Comforts, that
I cannot exprefs them ; and which I take Notice
of here, to put thofe discontented People in mind
of it, who cannot enjoy comfortably what God
has given them, becaufe they fee, and covet fome-
thing that he has not given them. All our Dif-
contents about what we want, appeared to me to
fpring from the Want of Thankfulnefs for what we
have.
Another Reflection was of great Ufe to me, and
doubtlcfs would be fo to any one that fhould fall
into fuch Diftrefs as mine was; and this was to
compare my prefent Condition with what I at jfirft
expected it fhould be; nay, with what it would
certainly have been, if the good Providence of
God had not wonderfully ordered the Ship to be
caft up nearer to the Shpre, where I riot only could
come
come at her, but could bring what I got out of her
to the Shore, for my Relief and Comfort; without
which, I had wanted for Tools to work, Weapons
for Defence, or Gun-powder and Shor for getting
my Food. ,
I fpent whole Hours, I may fay whole Days, in
representing to myfelf in the moft lively Colours,
how I muft have acted, if I had got nothing out
of the Ship; how I could not have fo much as
got any Food, except Fifh and Turtles; and that
as it was long before I found any of them, I muft
have perifh'd firft : That I mould have liv'd, if I
had not perifh'd, like a meer Savage: that if I
had kill'd a Goat, or a Fowl, by any Contrivance,
I had no way to flea or open them, or part the Fiefh
from the Skin and the Bowels, or to cut it up ;
but muft gnaw it with my Teeth, and pull it with
my Claws like a Beaft.
Thefe Reflections made me very fenfible of the
Goodnefs of Providence to me, and very thankful
for my prefent Condition, with all its Hardfhips
and Misfortunes: And this Part alfo 1 cannot but
recommend to the Reflection of thofe who are apt
in their Mifery to fay, Is any Afflittion like mine !
Let them confider, how much worfe the Cafes of
fome People are, and their Cafe might have been,
if Providence had thought fit.
I had another Reflection which affifted me alfo
to comfort my Mind with Hopes; and this was
comparing my prefent Condition with what I had
deferv'd, and had therefore Reafon to expect from
the Hand of Providence. I had liv'd a dreadful
Life, perfeaiy deftitute of the Knowledge and Fear
of G OD. I had been well inftruded by Father and
Mother; neither had they been wanting to me in
their early Endeavours, to infnfe a religious Awe
of G o D into my Mind, a Senfe of my Duty, and
of
of what the Nature and End of my Being requir'd
of me. But alas 1 falling early into the Sea-taring
Life, which of all the Lives is the moft deftitu'te
of the Fear of GOD, tho' his Terrors are al-
ways before them; I fay, falling early into the
Sea-faring Life, and into Sea-fating Company, all
that little Senfe of Religion which I had enter-
tain'd, waslaugh'd out of me by my Mefs-mates,
by a harden'd defpifiug of Dangers, and the Views
of Death, which grew habitual to me, by my long
Abfence from ail manner of Opportunities to con-
verfe with any thing but what was like myfelf,
or to hear any thing that was good, or tended to-
wards it.
So void was I of every thing that was good, or
of the lean: Senfe of what I was, or was to be,
that in the greetet t Deliverances 1 enjoy 'd, fuch
as my Efcape from Saffe, my being taken up by
the Portuguese Mafter of the Ship, my being plant-
ed fo well in the Brajils, my receiving the Cargo
from England, and the like, I never had once the
Word Thank God, fo much as t>n my Mind, or in-
my Mouth ; nor in the greateft Diftrefs, had I fo
much as a Thought to pray to him • or fo much as.
to fay, Lord have Mercy upon me; no nor to mention
the Name of GOD, .unlefs it was to fwear by,
and blafpheme it.
I had terrible Reflections upon my Mind fot:
many Months, as I have already obferv'd, on the
Account of my wicked and hardned Life paft ; and
when I look'd about me, and confider'd what parti-
cular Providences had attended me fince my com-
ing into this Place, and how God had dealt boun-
tifully with me; had not only punifh'd me lefs than
my Iniqfety had deferv'd, but had fo plentifully pro-
v ded for me j this gave me great Hopes that my
t Repen-
Mercy in ftore for me.
With thefe Reflections I work'd my Mind up,
pot only to Refignation to the Will'of God in the
prefent Difpofition of my Circumftances, but even
to a fincere Thankfulnefs for my Condition; and
that I who was yet a living Man, ought not to
complain, feeing I had not the due Punifhment of
my Sins; fhat I enjoy'd fo many Mercies which
I had no reafon to have expected in that Place;
that I ought never more to repine at my Condition,
but to rejoyce, and to give daily Thanks for that
daily Bread which nothing but a croud of Wonders
Could have brought. That I ought to confider I
had been fed even by Miracle, even as great as
that of feeding Elijah by Ravens; nay, by a long
Series of Miracles, and that I cofild hardly have
nam'd a Place in the unhabitable Part of the World
where I could have been caft more to my Advan-
tage : A Place, where as I had no Society, which'
was my Affliction on one hand, fo I found no rav
venous Beafts, no furious Wolves or Tygers to
threaten my Life, no venomous Creatures or poi-
fonous, which I might feed on to my hurt, no Sa-
vages to murder and devour me.
In a Word, as my Life was a Life of Sorrow'
one way, fo it was a Life of Mercy another ; and
I wanted nothing to make it a Life of Comfort,
but to be able to make my Senfe of God's Good-
nefs to me, and Care over me in this Condition,
be my daily Confolation ; and after I did make a
juft Improvement of thefe things, I went away and
was no more fad.
I had now been here fo long, that many things
which I brought on Shore for my Help, were either
quite gpne, or very much wafted and near fpent.
My
My Ink, as I obferv'd, had been gone for fomg
time, all but a very little, which I eek'd out with
Water a little and a little, till it was fo pale it fcarce
left any Appearance of black upon the Paper: As
long as it lafled I made ufe of it to minute down
the Days of the Month on which any remarkable
thing happen'd to me ; and firft by calling up
Times patt, I remember that there was a ftrange
Concurrence of Days in the various Providences
which befei me, and which, if I had been fupef-
ftitioufly inclin'd to obferve Days as Fatal or For-
tunate, I might have had Reafon to have look'd
upon with a great deal of Curiofity.
Firft, I had obferv'd, that the fame Day that I
broke away from my Father and my Friends, and
run away to Hull in order to go to Sea, the fame
Day afterwards I was taken by the Sails Man of
War, and made a Slave.
The fame Day of the Year that I efcaped out
of the Wreck of that Ship in Yarmouth Roads, that
fame Day-Year afterwards I made my efcape from
SaUe in the Boat.
The fame Day of the Year I was born on, (viz,.)
the joth of September, the fame Day I had my
Life fo miraculoutly faved 26 Years after, when I
was caft on Shore in this Ifland; fo that my wicked
Life and my folitary Life begun both on a Day.
The next thing to my Ink's being wafted, was
that of my Bread, I mean the Bisket which I
brought out of the Ship : this I had husbanded to
the laft degree, allowing myfelf but one Cake of
Bread a Day for above a Year, and yet I was quite
without Bread for near a Year before I got any
Corn of my own; and great Reafon I had to be
thankful that I had any at all, the getting it being.,
as has been already obferved, next to miraculous.
My
Linnen, 1 had had none a good while, except feme
chequerM Shirts which I found in the Chefts of the
other Seamen, and which I carefully preferv'd, be-
- caufe many times 1 could bear no other Cloaths
pu but a Shirt; and it was a very great help to me
that I had among all the Mens Cloaths of the Ship
almoit three dozen of Shirts. There were alfo fe-
yeral thick Watch-coats of the Seamens, which
were left indeed, but they were too hot to wearj
and tho' it is true, that the Weather was fo violent
hot that there was no need of Cloaths, yet I could
not go quite naked ; no, tho' I had been inclined
to it, which I was nor, nor could not abide the
Thoughts of it, tho' I was all alone.
The Reafon why 1 could not go quite naked,
was, I could not bear the Heat of the Sun fo
well when quite naked, as with fome Cloaths on;
nay, the very Heat frequently blifter'd my Skin $
whereas with a Shirt on, the Air itfelf made fome
Motion, and whittling under that Shirt, was twofold
cooler than without it: No more could 1 ever bring
myfelf to go out in the Heat of the Sun without a
Cap or a Hat; the Heat of the Sun beating with
fuch Violence as it does in that Place, would give
me the Head-ach prefently, by darting fo directly
on my Head, without a Cap or a Hat on; fo that I
could not bear it; whereas if I put on my Hat, it
would prefently go away.
Upon thofe Views I began to confider about put-
ting the few Rags I had, which I called Cloaths,
into fome Order: I had worn out all the, Waift-
coats.1 had, and my Bufinefs was now to try if I
could not make Jackets out of the great Watch-
coats which I had by me, and with fuch other
Materials as I had; fo I fet to work a Tayloring,
or rather indeed a Botching; for I made moft
piteous
piteous Work of it. However, I made fhift to
make two or three new Waiftcoats, which I hoped
would ferve me a great while; as foriBreeches or
Drawers, I made but a very forry fmft indeedj till
afterward.
I have mentioned, that I faved the Skins of all
the Creatures that I kill'd, I mean four-footed ones,
and I had hung them up ftretch'd out with Sticks
in the Sun, by which means fome of them were fo
dry and hard that they were fit for little, but others
it feems were very ufeful. The firft thiag I made
of thefe was a great Cap for my Head, with the
Hair on the Outfide to moor off the Rain; and
this I perform'd fo well, that after this I made me
a Suit of Cloaths whoily of thefe Skins, that is to
lay, a Waiftcoat and Breeches open at Knees, and
both loofe, for they were rather wanting to keep
me cool than to keep me warm. I muft not omic
to acknowledge that they were wretchedly made j
for if I was a bad Carpenter, 1 was a worfe Taylor.
However, they were fuch as I made very good
fhift with ; and when I was abroad, if it happen'd
to rain, the Hair of my Waiftcoat and Cap being
outermoft, 1 was kept very dry.
After this I fpent a great deal of Time and Pains
to make me an Umbrella; I was indeed in great
want of one, and had a great mind to make one ;
I had feen them made in the Brafik, where they
are very ufeful in the great Heats which are there :
And I felt the Heats every jot as great here, and
greater too, being nearer the Equinox; befides, as
1 was obliged to be much abroad, it was a moft
ufeful thing to me, as well for the Rains as the
Heats. 1 took a world of Pains at it, and was a
great while before I could make any thing likely
to hold; nay, after I thought I had hit the way, I
fpoil'd 2 or 3 before I made one to my mind; but
at
at laft I made one that anfwer'd indifferently well i
the main difficulty I found was to make it to let
down : I could make it to fpread, but if it did not
let down too, and draw in, it was not portable for
me any way but juft over my Head, which would
not do. However, at laft, as I faid, I made one
to anfwer, and cover'd it with Skins, the Hair up-
wards, fo that it caft off the Rains like a Pent-
houfe, and kept off the Sun fo effectually, that I
could walk out in the hotteft of the Weather with
greater Advantage than I could before in the cool-
eft, and when I had no need of it, could clofe it
and carry it under my Arm. • ;.
Thus I lived mighty comfortably, my Mind be-
ing entirely compofed by refigning to the Will of
God, and throwing myfelf wholly upon the Dif-
pofal of his Providence. This made my Life bet-
ter than fbtiable ; for when I began to regret the
want of Converfation, I would ask myfelf,whether
thus converfing mutually with my own Thoughts,.
and, as I hope I may fay, with even God himfelf
by Ejaculations, was not better than the utmoft
Enjoyment of humane Society in the World?
I cannot fay that after this, for five Years, any
extraordinary thing happen'd to me, but I Hv'd on
in the fame courfe, in the fame Pofture and Place,
as juft before. The chief things I was employ'd in,
befides my yearly Labour of planting my Barley and
Rice, and curing my Raifins, of both which I al-
ways kent up juft enough to have fufficient Stock
of one Year's Provifions beforehand; I fay, befides
this yearly Labour, and my daily Labour of going
out with my Gun, I had one Labour to make me a
Canoe, which at laft I finifhed: So that by dig-
Ring a Canal to it of fix Foot wide, and four Foot
deep, I brought it into the Creek, almdft half a
Mile. As'for the firft, which was fovaftly big. .
as
ought to do, how I fhould be able to launch it; fo
never being able to bring it to the Water, or bring.
the Water to it, I was oblig'd to let it lie where it
was, as a Memorandum to teach me to be wifer next
Time : Indeed, the next Time, tho' I could not
get a Tree proper for it, and in a Place where I
could not get the Water to it, at any lefs Diftance
than as I have faid, near half a Mile; yet as I faw
it was practicable at laft, I never gave it over; and
though I was near two Years about it, yet I never
grudg'd my Labour, in Hopes of having a Boat to
go oft to Sea at laft.
. However , though my little Perfagua was fi-
nifh'd, yet the Size of it was not at all anfwerable
to the Defign which I had in View, when I made
the firft; I mean, of venturing over to the 'Terra
Firma, where it was above forty Miles broad; ac-
cordingly, the Smallnefs of my Boat aflifted to put
an End to that Defign, and now I thought no more
of it: But as I had a Boat, my next Defign was to
make a Tour round the Ifland ; for as I had been on
the other Side, in one Place, croffing, as I have al-
ready defcrib'd it, over the Land ; fo the Difcove-
ries I made in that little Journey, made me very ea-
ger to fee other Parts of the Coaft ; and now I had
a Boat, I thought of nothing but failing rouncUhe
Wand.
For this Purpofe, that I might do every Thing.
with Difcretion and Consideration, I fitted up a lit-
tle Maft to my Boat; and made a Sail to it out of
Come of the Pieces of the Ship's Sail, which lay in
flore ; and of which I had a great Stock by me.
Having fitted my Maft and Sail, and try'd the
Boat, I found fhe would fail very well : Then I
made little Lockers, or Boxes, at either End of my
Boat, to put Provifions, Ncceflkries and. Ammuni-
M tior>
or the Sprye of the Sea; and a little long hollow
Place I cut in the Iniide of the Boat, where I could
lay my Gun, making a Flap to hang down over it
to keep it dry.
I nVd my Umbrella alfo in a Step at the Stern,
like a Matt, to iland over my Head, and keep the
Heat of the Sun off of me like an Aiming ; and
thus I every now and then • took a little Voyage
upon the Sea, but never went far out, not far from
the little Creek ; but at laft being eager to view
the Circumference of my little Kingdom, I re/blv'd
upon my Tour, and accordingly I viciuall'd my
Ship for the Voyage, putting in two Dozen of
my Loaves, (Cakes I {hould rather call them) of
Barley Bread, an Earthen Pot foil of parch'd Rice,
a Food t eat a great deal of, a little Bottle of Rum,
halfa Goat, and Powder and Shot for killing more,,
and two large Watch-coats, of thofe which, as I
raention'd before, I had fav'd out of the Seamen's
Chefts ; thefe I took, one to lie upon, and the
other to cover me in the Night.
It was the fixth of November, in the fixth Year
of my Reign, or my Captivity, which you pleafe,
that I fet out on this Voyage, and I found it much
longgr than I expected; for though the Ifland itfelf
was not very large, yet when I came to the Eaft
Side of it, I found a great Ledge of Rocks lie out
above two Leagues into the Sea, fome above Wa-
ter, fome under it ; and beyond that, a Shoal of
Sand, lying dry halfa League more ; fo that I was
oblig'd to go a great Way out to Sea to double the.
Point.
When firft I difcover'd them, I was going to give
over my Enterprise, and come back again, not
knowing how far it might oblige me to go out tQL
Sea ; and above all, doubting how I fhould get back
again ;
again ; fo I came to an Anchor; for I had made
me a kind of an Anchor with a Piece of a broken
Graplin, which I got out of the Ship.
Having fecur'd my Boat, I took my Gun, and
went on Shore, climbing up upon a Hill, which
feem'd to overlook that Point, where I faw the
full Extent of it, and refolv'd to venture.
In my viewing the S^a from that Hill where I
ftood, I perceived a ftrong, and indeed, a moft fu-
rious Current, which run to the Eaft, and even
came clofe to the Point; and I took the more No-
tice of it, becanfe I law there might be fome Dan-
ger, that when I came into it, I might be carry'd
out to Sea by the Strength of it, and not be able
to make the Illand again; and indeed, had I not
gotten firft up upon this Hill, I believe it would
have been fo ; for there was the fame Current on
the other Side • the liland, only that it fet off -at
a farther Diilance ; and I faw there was a flrong
Eddy under the Shore; fo I had nothing to do but
to get in out of the firft Current, and I Ihould
prefently be in an Eddy.
I lay here, however, two Days ; becaufe the
Wind blowing pretty frefh at E. S. E. and that
being juft contrary to the faid Current, made a
great Breach of the Sea upon the Point; fo that it
was not fafe for me to keep too .clofe to the Shore
for the Breach, nor to go too far off becaufe of the
. Streatp.,',..,
.. The (third Day in.the Morning, the Wind ha-
ying abated over Night, the Sea was calm, and I
vcnturd^ but I am a warning Piece again tc&dl
rafh and ignorant Pilpts; for no fooner was I come
to the Point, when even I was not my Boat's
Length .from the Shore, but I found my (elf in a
great Depth of Water, and a Current like the Sluice
of-.a Mill: It carry'd my Boat along with ic
M 2 with
with fuch Violence, that all I could do, could not
keep her*fo much as on the Edge of it; but I found
it hurried me farther and farther out from the Ed-
dy, which was on my Left Hand. There was no
YVind ftirring to help me, and all I could do with
my Paddlers fignify'd nothing ;-and now I began to
give myfelf over for loft; for as the Current was
on both Sides the Ifland, I knew in a few Leagues
Diftance they muft join again, and then I was ir-
recoverably gone; nor did I fee any Poffibility of
avoiding it; fo that I had no Profpeflt before me
but of Perifhing; not by the Sea, for that was
calm enough, but of ftarving for Hunger. I had
indeed found a Tcrtoife on the Shore, as big al-
moft as I could lift, and had tofs'd it into the
Boat; and I had a great Jar of frefh Water, that is
to fay, one of my Earthen Pots; but what was all
this to being driven into the vaft Ocean, where, to
be fure, there was no Shore, no main Land, or Ifland,
for a thoufand Leagues at leaft ?
And now I faw how eafy it was for the Provi-
dence of God to make the moft miferable Condi-
tion Mankind could be in, -morfe. Now I look'd
back upon my defolate folitary Ifland, as the moft
pleafant Place in the World, and'all the Happinefs
my Heart could wifh for, was to be but there
again. I ftretch'd out my Hands to it with eager
Wifhes. O happy Defart, faid I, I ftall never fee
thee more! O miferable Creature, faid. I, whi-
ther am I going; Then I reproach'd myfelf with
my unthankful Temper, and how I had repin'd at
my folitary Condition; and now what would I give
to be on Shore there again ? Thus we never fee
the true State of our Condition, till it is illuftrated
to us by its Contraries; nor know how to value
what we enjoy, but by the want of it. It is fcarce
poffible to imagine the Consternation I was now in,
being
peared ro me now to be) into the wide Ocean, al- .
moft two Leagues, and in the utmoft*Defpair of
ever recovering it again. However, I work'd hard,
till indeed my Strength was almoft exhaufted, and
kept my Boat as much to the Northward, that is,
towards the Side of the Current which the Eddy
lay on, as poffibly I could ; when about Noon, as
the Sun pafs'd the Meridian, I thought I felt a lit-
tle J3reeze of Wind in my Face, fpringing up from
the S. S. E. This chear'd my Heart a little, and
efpecially when in about half an Hour more ic1
blew a pretty fmall gentle Gale. By this Time I
was gotten at a frightful Diftance from the Bland,
and had the leaft Cloud or hazy Weather interven'd,
I had been undone another Way too; for I had no
.Ccmj.afs on Board, and mould never have known
how to have fleered towards the Ifland, if I had
but once loft Sight of it ; but the Weather con-
tinuing clear, I apply'd myfelf to get up my Maft
again, fpread my Sail, /landing away to the North
as much as poffible, to get out of the Current.
Juft as I had fet my Maft and Sail, and the Boat
began to ftretch away, I faw even by the Clear-
nefs of the Water, fome Alteration of the Current
was near; for where the Current was fo ftrong, the
Water was foul; but perceiving the Water clear, I
found the Current abate, and prefently I found to
the JSaft, at about half a Mile, a Breach of the Sea
upon fome Rocks; thefe Rocks I found caus'd the
Current to part again, and as the main Strefs of it
ran .away more Southerly, leaving the Rocks to the
Nmth-Eaft; fo the other return'd by the Repulfeof
the Rocks, and made a ftrong Eddy, which fan
back again to the Nmtb-lVeft with a very {harp
Stream.
;;;; M3 They
They who know what it is to have a Reprieve
brought to them upon the Ladder, or to be refcu-
ed from Thieves juft going t.p murder them, or
who have been in fuch like Extremities, may guefs
what my prefent Surprize of Joy was, and how glad-
ly I put my Boat into the Stream pf this Eddy, and
the Wind alfo fremning, how gladly I fpread my
Sail to it, running chearfully before the Wind, and
with a ftrong Tide or Eddy under Foot.
This Eddy carry'd me about a League in my
Way back again dire&ly towards the liland, but
about two Leagues more to the Northward than
the Current whiph carried me away at full; fo that
when I came near the Ifland, I found myfelf open
to the Northern Shore of it, that is to fay, the other
End of the Ifland oppofite to that which I went out
from.
When I had made fomething more thaft a League
pf Way by the Help of this Current or Eddy, I found
it was fpent and ferv'd me no farther. However, \
found that being between the two great Currents,
(viz,.) that on the South Side, which had hurried
me away, and that on the North, which lay about
a League on the other Side : I fay, between thefe
two, in the V/ake of the Ifland, I found the Water
at lea't /till and running no Way; and having {till a
Breeze of Wind fair for me, I kept on fleering di-
rectly for the Ifland, tho? not making fuch frefh Way
as I did before.
About four a-Clock in.the Evening, being then
within about a League of the Ifland, I found the
Point of the Rocks which occafion'd this Difafter,
Itretching out, as is defcribed before, to the Solith-
jvard, and carting off the Current more Southward-
ly, had cf courfe made another Eddy to the North,
arid this I found very ftrong, bat not dire&ly fctting
£he Way my Courfe lay, which was due Weft, but
almoft
I ftretch'd a-crofs this Eddy flanting North-weft,
and in about an Hour came within about a Mile
of the Shore, where it being fmooth Water, I foon
got to Land.
When I was on Shore I fell on my Knees and
gave God Thanks for my Deliverance, refolving '
to lay afide all Thoughts of my Deliverance by my
Boat; and refreming myfelf with fuch Things as"
I had, I brought my Boat clofe to the Shore in a
little Cove that I had fpy'd under fome Trees, and
laid me down to fleep, being quite fpent with the
Labour and Fatigue of the Voyage.
I was now at a great Lofs which Way to get
Home with my Boat : I had run fo much Hazard,
and knew too much the Cafe to think of attempt-
ing it by the Way I went out; and what might be
at the other Side, (I mean the Weft Side) 1 knew
not, nor had I any Mind to run any more Ventures,
fo I only refolved in the Morning to make my Way
Weft ward along the Sjiore, and to fe.e if there Vas
• no Creek where I might lay up my Frigate in Safe-
ty, fo as to have her again if I wanted her. In about
three Miles, or thereabout, coafting the Shore, I
came to a very good Inlet, or Bay, about a Mile over,
which narrowed till it came to a very little Rivulet
or Brook, where I found a very convenient Harbour
for my Boat, and where fhe lay as if fhe had been
in a little Dock made on purpofe for her. Here I
put in, and having fiow'd my Boat very fafe, I went
on Shore to look about me, and fee where 1 was,
I foon found I had but a little pafs'd by the Place
where I had been before, when I traveled on Foot
to that Shore ; fo taking nothing out of my Boat,
but my Gun and my Umbrella, for it was ex-
ceeding hot, I began my March. The Way was
comfortable enough after fuch a Voyage as I had
M 4 beea
•
Evening, where I found every thing Handing as I
left it; for I always kept it in good Order, being,
as I faid before, my Country-houfe.
I got over the Fence, and laid me down in the
Shade to reft my Limbs, for I was very weary, and
fell afleep : But judge you, if you can, that read my
'Story, what a Surprize I muft be in, when I was
wak'd out of my Sleep by a Voice calling me by
my Name feveral times, Robin, Robin, Robin Crufoe,
poor Rcbin Crufoe ! where are you Ribin Crujoe ?
_Where are you ? Where have you been ?
I was fo dead. afleep at firft, being fatigu'd with
Rowing, or Paddling, as it is cali'd, the firlt
Part or' the Day, and with Walking the latter Part,
that I did not wake thoroughly; but dozing be-
tween fleeping and waking, thought I dream'd
that fome body fpoke to me : But as the Voice
continu'd to repeat, Robin Crufoe, Rcbin Crttjoe, at
laft I began to wake more perfectly, .and was at
firft dreadfully frighted, and ftarted up in the ut-
moft Confternation : But no fooner were my Eyes
open, but I faw my Poll fitting on the Top of the
Hedge, and immediately knew that it was he that
fpoke to me; for juft in fuch bemoaning Language
I had ufed to talk to him, and teach him ; and he
had learn'd it fo perfedly, that he would fit upon
my Finger, and lay his Bill clcfe-to my Face, and
cry, Poor Robin Crufoe, Where are you ? Where have
you been ? How come you her? ? and fuch things as I
had taught him.
However, even though I knew it was the Parrot,
and that indeed it could be no body elfe, it was
a good while before I could compofe myfeM :
Firft, I was amazed how the Creature got thither,
and then how he fhould juft keep about the Place,
and &> where elfe ; But as I was well faris/ied it
: ' COlU4
could be no body but honeft Poff, I got it over;
and holding out my Hand, and calling him by his
Name Poll, the fociable Creature came to me, and
fat upon my Thumb, as he ufed to do, and conti-
nued talking to me, Poor Robin Crufoe, and bow
did I come here ? and where had I been ? juft as if he
had been overjoy'd to fee me again ; and fo I car-
ry 'd him Home along with me.
I had now had. enough of rambling to Sea for
fome time, and had enough to do for many Days
to fit ftill, and reflect upon the Danger I had been
in. I would have been very glad to have had
my Boat again on my Side of the liland ; but I
knew not how it was practicable to get it about
as to the Eaft Side of the Ifland ; which I had
gone round : I knew well enough there was no ven-
turing that Way ; my very Heart would fhrink, and
my very Blood run chill but to think of it : And as
to the other Side of the Ifland, I did not know
( how it might be there ; but fuppofing the Current
ran with the fame Force againft the Shore at the
Eaft, as it pafs'd by it on the other, I might run
the fame Risk of being driven down the Stream,
and carry'd by the Ifland, as I had been before, of
being carry'd away from it; fo with thefe Thoughts
I contented my felt to be without any Boat, tho'
it had been the Product of fo many Months La-
bour to make it, and of fo many more to get it
unto the Sea-
In this Government of my Temper I remain'd
near a Year, lived a very fedate retired Life, as
you may well fuppofc ; and n»y Thoughts being
very much compofed as to my Condition, and
fully comforted in refigning myfelf to the Dif-
pofitions of Providence, 1 thought I liv'd ceally ve-
ry happily in all things, except that of Society.
I im-
I improv'd my felt in this time in all the mecha-
nick Exercifes which my Neceffities put me upon
applying myfelf to, and I believe could, upon Qc-
caiion, have made a very good Carpenter, especially
confidering how few Tools I had.
Befides this, I arrived at an unexpected Per-
fection in my Earthen Ware, and contrived well
enough to make them with a Wheel, which I found
infinitely eafier and better ; "becaufe I made Things
round and fhapable, which before were filthy
Things indeed to look on. But I think I was ne-
ver more vain of my own Performance, or more
joyful for any Thing I found out, than for my be-
ing able to make a Tobacco-Pipe. And tho' it was
a very ugly clumfy Thing, when it was done, and
only burnt red like other Earthen Ware, yet as it
was hard and firm, and would draw the Smoke, I
was exceedingly comforted with it; for I had been
always ufcd to fmoke, and there were Pipes in the
Ship, but I forgot them at firft, not knowing that
there was Tobacco in the Ifland ; and afterwards,»
when I fearch'd the Ship again,' I could not come
at any Pipes at all.
In my Wicker Ware alfo I improved much, and
made abundance of neceflary Baskets, as well as
my Invention fhew'd me, though not very hand-
fome, yet they were fuch as were very handy and
convenient for my laying Things up in, of fetching
Things home in. For Example, if I kill'd a Goat
abroad, I could hang it up in a Tree, flea it, and
drcfs it, and cut it in Pieces, and bring it home in
a Basket; and th^e like by a Turtle, I could cut it
up, take out the Eggs, and a Piece or two of the
Flefh, which was enough for me, and bring them
home jn a Basket , and leave the reft behind
me. Alfo large deep Baskets were my Recei-
vers for my Corn., which I always rub'd out as
fpoq
foon as it was dry, and cured, and kept it in great
Baskets.
I began now to perceive my Powder abated confi-
derably, and this was a want which it was im-
podible for me to fupply, and I began ferioufly to
confider what I muft do when I fhould have no
more Powder; that is to fay, how I fhould do to
kill any Goats. I had, as is obferv'd in the third
Year of my being here, kept a young Kid, and bred
her up tame, and I was in hopes of getting a He-
Goat, but I could not by any means bring it to
pafs, till my Kid grew an old Goat ; and I could
never find in my Heart to kill her, till fhe dy'd at
lafl of meer Age.
But being now in the eleventh Year of my Refi-
dence, and, as I have faid, my Ammunition grow-
ing low, I fet myfelf to ftudy fome Art to trap and
{hare the Goats, to fee whether I could not catch
fome of them alive, and particularly I wanted a She-
* Goat great with Young.
To this Purpofe I made Snares to hamper them,
and I do believe they were more than once taken
in them ; but my Tackle was not good, for I had
no Wire, and I always found them broken, and my
Bait devour'd.
At length I refolv'd to try a Pit-fall, fo I dug
feveral large Pits in the Earth, in Places where I
had obferv'd the Goats ufed to feed, and over thefe
Pits I phced Hurdles of my own making too,
with a. great Weight upon them; and feveral times
I put Ears of Barley and dry Rice, without fet-
ting the Trap, and I could eafily perceive that the
(Goats had gone in and eaten up the Corn, for I
could fee the Mark of their Feer. At length I fct
three Traps in one Night, and going the next
Morning I found them all {landing, and yet the
Bait eaten and gone. This was very difcouraging:
'How-
you with Particulars, going one Morning to fee my
Trap, I found in one of them a large old He-Goat,
and in one of the other three Kids, a Male, and
two Females.
As to the old one, I knew not what to do with
him, he was fo fierce I durft not go into the Pit to
him; that is to fay, to go about to bring him away
alive, which was what I wanted. I could have
kill'd him, but that was not my Bufinefs, nor would
it anfwer my End. So I e'en let him out, and he
ran away as if he had been frighted out of his
Wits: But I had forgot then what I learned af-
terwards, that Hunger will tame a Lion. If I
had let him flay there three or four Days without
Food, and then have carry'd him fome Water to
drink, and then a little Corn, he would have been
as tame as one of the Kids, for they are mighty
fagacious tractable Creatures where they are well •
ufed.
However, for the prefent I let him go, knowing
no better at that Time ; then I went to tlje three
Kids, and taking them one by one, I ty'd them
with Strings together, and with fome Difficulty
brought them all-Home.
It was a good while before they would feed, but
throwing them fome fwcet Corn, it tempted them,
and they began to be tame : and now 1 found that
if I expected to fupply myfelf with Goat-Flefh
when I had no Powder or.Shot left, breeding fome
up tame was my only Way, when perhaps I
might have them about my Houfe like a Flock of
Sheep.
. .But then it prefently occur'd to me, that I mutt
: keep the Tame from the Wild, oreSfe they would
always run wild when they grew up; and the only_
Way for this was to have fome enclofed Piece ot
,,i ? ' Ground,
keep them in fo effectually, that thofe within might
not break out, or thofe without break in.
This was a great Undertaking for one Pair of
Hands; yet as 1 faw there was an abfolute Necef-
fity of doing it, my firft Piece of Work was to
find out a proper Piece of Ground, viz.. where there
was likely to be Herbage for them to eat, Water
for them to drink, and Cover to keep them from the
Sun.
Thofe who underiland fuch Enclofures will think
I had very little Contrivance, when J pitch'd upon
a Place very proper for all thefe, being a plain
open piece of Meadow-Land or Savanna, (as our
People call it in the Weftern Colonies,) which had
two or three little Drills of frefh Water in it, and
at one end was very woody: I fay they will fmile
at my Forecaft, when I {hall tell them I began my
enclofing of this Piece of Ground in fuch a Man-
ner, that my Hedge or Pale muft have been at leaft
two Mile about. Nor was the Madnefs of it fo
great as to the Compafs, for if it was ten Mile
about I was like to have time enough to do it in.
But I did not confider that my Goats would be as
wild in fo much Compafs, as if they had had the
whole Ifland, and I Ihould have fo much Room
to chace them in, that I fhould never catch
them.
My Hedge was begun and carry'd on, I believe,
about fifty Yards, when this Thought occur'd to
me; fo I prefently ftopt fhort, and for the firft be-
ginning 1 refolv'd to enclofe a Piece of about ijo
Yards in length, and 100 Yards in breadth, which as
it would maintain as many as I ftould have in any
reafonable time, fo as my Flock encreafed, I could
add more Ground to my Enclofure.
This
This was acting with fome Prudence, and I went
to work with Courage. I was about three Months
hedging in the firft Piece, and till I had done it I
tether'd the three Kids in the bell part of it, and
us'd them to feed as near me as poffible to make
them familiar; and very often I would go and car-
ry them fome Ears of Barley, or a handful of Rice,
and feed them out of my Hand; fb that after my
Enclofure was finifhed, and I let them loofe, they
would follow me up and down, bleating after me
for a handful of Corn.
This anfwer'd my End, and in about a Year and
half I had a Flock of about twelve Goats, Kids
and all; and in two Years more I had three and
forty, befides feveral that I took and killed for my
Food. And after that I enclofed five feveral Pie-
ces of Ground to feed them in, with little Pens to
drive them into, to take them as I wanted, and
Gates out of one Piece of Ground into ano-
ther.
But this was not all, for now I not only had
Goats-Flefh to feed on when I pleas'd, but Milk
too, a thing which indeed in my beginning I did
not fo much as think of, and which, when it came
into my Thoughts, was really an agreeable Sur-
prize. For now I fet up my Dairy, and had fome-
times a Gallon or two of Milk in a Day. And as
Nature, who gives Supplies of Food to every
Creature, dictates even naturally how to make ufe
of it; fo I.that had never milk'd a Cow, much lefs.
a Goat, or feen Butter or Cheefe made, very rea-
dily and handily, tho' after a great many Eflays and
Mifcarriages, made me both Butter and Cheefe
at laft, and never wanted it afterwards.
How mercifully can our great Creator treat his
Creatures, even in thofe Conditions in which they
feem'd to be overwhelm'd in Deftruction! How.
can
us caufe to praife him for Dungeons and Prifons !
What a Table was here fpread for me in a Wilder-
nefs, where I faw nothing at firft but to perim for
Hunger! ,
It would have made a Stoick fmile to have feen
me and my little Family fit down to Dinner; there
was my Majefty the Prince and Lord of the whole
Itland ; 1 had the Lives-of all my Subje&s at my
abfoJute Command. I could hang, draw, give Li-
berty, and take it away, and no Rebels among all
my Subjects.
Then to fee how like a King I din'd too all
alone, attended by my Servants; Poll, as if he had
been my Favourite, was the only Perfon permit-
ted to talk to me. My Dog, who was now grown
very old and crazy, and had found no Species to
multiply his Kind upon, fat always at my Right
Hand ; and two Cats, one on one Side the Ta-
ble, and one on the other, expecting now and
then a Bit from my Hand, as a Mark of fpecial
Favour.
But thefe were not the two Cats which I brought
on Shore at firft, for they were both of them dead,
and had been interr'd near my Habitation by my
own Hand ; but one of them having multiply'd by *
I know not what Kind of Creature, thefe were
two which I had preferv'd tame, whereas the reft
run wild in the Woods, and became indeed trou-
blefome to me at laft ; for they would often come ;>.
into my Houfe, and plunder me too, till at laft I
was obliged to fhoot them, and did kill a great
many ; at length they left me with this Atten-. »
dance, and in this plentiful Manner I liv'd ; nei- .
ther could I be faid to want any thing but Society,
and of that in fome. time after "this I was like to
have too much.
I was
to have the Ufe of my Boat; though very loth to
run any more Hazards; and therefore fometimes I
fat contriving Ways to get her about the Ifland,
and at other times I fat my felf down contented
enough without her. But* I had a flrange Uneafinefs
in my Mind to go down to the Point of the Ifland,
where, as I have faid, in my laft Ramble, I went up
the Hill to fee how the Shore lay, and how the Cur-
rent fet, that I might fee what I had to do: This
Inclination increas'd upon me every Day, and at
length I refolv'd to travel thither by Land ; follow-
ing the Edge of the Shore, I did fo : But had any
one in England been to meet fuch a Man as I was, it
muft either have frighted them, or rais'd a great
deal of Laughter ; and as I frequently flood Hill to
look at myfelf, I could not but fmile at the Notion
of my travelling through Torkflrire with fuch an E-
quipage, and in fuch a Drefs : Be pleas'd to take a
Sketch of my Figure as follows.
I had a great high fhapelefs Cap, made of a
Goat's Skin, with a Flap hanging down behind, as
well to keep the Sun from me, as to {hoot the Rain
oft from running into my Neck ; nothing being fo
hurtful in thefe Climates, as the Rain upon the
Flefh under the Cloaths.
I had a fhort Jacket of Goat-Skin, the Skirts co-
ming down to about the Middle of my Thighs ;
and a Pair of open-knee'd Breeches of the fame; the
Breeches were made of the Skin of an old He-goat,
whofe Hair hung down fuch a Length on either
Side, that like Pantaloons it reach'd to the Middle ot
my Legs; Stockings and Shoes I had none, but had
made me a Pair of fome-things, I fcarce know
what to call them, like Buskins, to flap over my
Legs, and lace on either Side like Spatter-dafties;
but
the reft of my Cldaths.
I had on a broad Belt of Goat's-Skin dry'd,
which I drew together with two Thongs of the
fame, inftead of Buckles, and in a kind of a Frog
on either Side of this. Inftead of a Sword and a
Dagger, hung a little Saw and a Hatchet, one on
one Side, one on the other. I had another Beit
not fo broad, and faften'd in the fame Manner,
which hung over my Shoulder; and at the End ot
it, under my left Arm hung two Pouches, both
made of Goat's-Skin too; in one of which hung
my Powder, in the other my Shot: At my Back I
carried my Basket, on my Shoulder my Gun, and
over my Head a great clumfy ugly Goat-Skin Um-
brella, but which, after all, was the moft neceffary
Thing I had about me, next to my Gun ; As for
my Face, the Colour of it was really not fo Moletta
like as one might expect from a Man not at all care-
ful of it, and living within nineteen Degrees of the
Equinox. My Beard I had once fufter'd to grow till
it was about a quarter of a Yard long; but as I had
both Sciflarsand Razors fufficient, I had cat it pret-
ty fliort, except what grew. on my upper Lip, which
I had trim'd into a large Pair of Mahometan VVhif-
kers, fuch as I had feen worn by fome 'Turks, who I
faw at Sails, for the Moors did not wear fuch, tho'
the Turks did; of thefe Mufchatoes or Whiskers,. I
will not fay they were long enough to hang my Hat
upon them; but they were of a Length and Shape
monftrous enough, and fuch as in England would
h:ive pafs'd for frightful.
But all this is by the by; for as to my Figure, I
had fo few to obferve me, that it was of no man-
ner of Confequence ; fo I fay no more to that Part.
In this kind of Figure I went my new Journey, and
was out five or fix Days. I travel'd firft along the
N Sea-
my Boat to an Anchor, to get up upon the Rocks;
and having no Beat now to take care of, I went over
the Land a nearer Way, to the fame Height that
I was upon before; when looking forward to the
Point of the Rocks which lay out, and which I was
oblig'd to double with my Boat, as is faid above,
I was furpriz'd to fee the Sea all fmooth and quiet,
no Ripling, no Motion, no Current, any more there
than in other Places.
I was at a ftrange Lofs to underftand this, and
refolv'd to fpend fome Time in the obferving ir, to
fee if nothing from the Sets of the Tide had occa-
fion'd it; but I was prefently convinced how it was,
•viz,. That the Tide of Ebb fetting from the Weft,
and joyning with the Current of Waters from fome
great River on the Shore, muft be the Occafion of
this Current; and that according .is the Wind blew
more forcibly from the Weft, or from the North,
this Current came near, or went farther from the
Shore; for waiting thereabouts till Evening, I went
up to the Rock again, and then the Tide of Ebb
being made, I plainly faw the Current again as be-
fore, only, that it run farther off, being near half a
League from the Shore; whereas in my Cafe, it
fet clofe upon the Shore, and hurried me aud my
Canoe along with it, which at another Time it
would not have done.
This Obfervation convinc'd me, That I hail no-
thing to do but to obferve the Ebbing and the
Flowing of the Tide, and I might very eafiiy bring
my Boat about the Ifland again : But when 11 «•
gau to think of putting it in Practice, I had fuch a
Terror upon my Spirits at the Remembrance c<t
ii •»"•* <•>••• * .. f «» ..I.1., t *
the Danger I had been in, that I could not think1,
of it again with any Patience; b.ut on the contrary,
I took up another Refolution, which was more fafe,
would build, or rather make me another Pariagua
or Canoe; and fo have one for one Side of the Id and,
and one for the other.
You are to underftand, that now I had, as t
may call it^ two Plantations in the Ifland; one my
little Fortification or Tent, with the Wall about
it under the Rock, with the Cave behifid me^
which by this Time I had enlarg'd into feveral
Apartments or Caves, one within another. One
of thefe, which was the dryeft, aod largeft, and
had a Door out beyond my Wail or Fortification;
that is to fey, beyond where my Wall joyn'd to
the Rock, was all fill'd up with the large Earthen
Pots, of which I have given an Account,. and with1
fourteen or fifteen great Baskets, which would hold
five or fix Bufhels eaehj where I laid up my Stores
of Provifion, efpecially my Corn, foirie in the Ear
cut off fhort from the Straw, and the other rub'd
out with my Hand.
As for my Wall made, as before-^ with long Stakel
bt PileSj thdfc Piles grevtr all like Trees, and were
by this Time grown fo big* and fpread fo very
much, that there was not the leaft Appearance to'
any one's View of any Habitation behind them.
Near this Dwelling of mine, but a little farther
within the Land, and upon lower Ground, lay my
two Pieces of Corn-Ground, which I kept duly
cultivated and fow'd, and which duly yielded me
their Harveft in its Seafon; and whenever I had
oceafion for more Corn, I had more Land adjoyn-
ing as fit as that.
Befides this, I had my Country Seat, and I hadl
now a tolerable Plantation there alfo; for firft, I
had ray little Bower, as 1 call'd it, which I kept'
in Repair) that is to fay, I kept the Hedge which
circled it in> conftantly fitted up to its ufual Height,
N * the
-•
.••
the Ladder {landing always in the Infide; I kept
the Trees which at firft were no more than my
Stakes, but were now grown very firm and tall; I
kept them always fo cut, that they might fpread and
grow thick and wild, and make the more agreeable
Shade, which they did effectually to my Mind. In
the Middle of this I had my Tent always ftanding,
being a piece of a Sail fpread over Poles fet up for
that Purpofe, and which never wanted any Repair
or Renewing ; and under this I had made me a Squab
or Couch, with the Skins of the Creatures I had
kill'd, and with other foft Things, and a Blanket
laid on them, fuch as belong'd to our Sea-Bedding,
which I had faved, and a great Watch-Coat to
cover me ; and here, whenever I had Occafion to
be abfent from my chief Seat, I took up my Coun-
try Habitation.
Adjoyning to this I had my Enclofures for my
Cattle, that is to fay, my Goats: And as I had taken
an inconceivable deal of Pains to fence and enclofe
this Ground, fo I was fo uneafy to fee it kept entire,
left the Goats fhould break thro', that I never left
off till with infinite Labour I hadftuck the Outfide
of the Hedge fo full offmall Stakes, and fo near to
one another, that it was rather a Pale than a Hedge,
and there was fcarce Room to put a Hand thro
between them, which afterwards when thofe Stakes
grew, as they all did in the next rainy Seafon, made
the Enclofure ftrong like a Wall, indeed ftronger
than any Wall. •
This will teftify for me that I was not idle,
and that I fpared no Pains to bring to pafs what-
ever appear'd neceflary for my comfortable Sup-
port ; for I confider'd the keeping up a Breed or
tame Creatures thus at my Hand, would be a li-
ving Magazine of Flefh, Milk, Butter and Cheefe,
for
forty Years, and that keeping them in my Reach,
•depended entirely upon my perfecting my Enclo-
fures to fuch a Degree, that I might be fure of
keeping them together; which by this Method in-
deed I fo effectually fecur'd, that when thefe lit-
tle Stakes began to grow, I had planted them fo
very thick, I was forced to pull fome of them up
again.
In this Place alfo I had my Grapes growing,
which I principally depended on for my Winter
Store of Raifins, and which I never fail'd to pre-
ferve very carefully, as the beft and moft agreeable
Dainty of my whole Diet ; and indeed 'they were
not agreeable only, but phyfical, wholefome, nou-
rifhing and refreming to the laft Degree. *
As this was alfo about half Way between my o-
ther Habitation and the Place where I had laid up
my Boat, I generally ftay'd, and lay here in my
Way thither; for I ufed frequently to vifit my
Boat, and I kept all things about or belonging to
her in very good Order; fometimes I went out in
her to divert my felfj but no more hazardous
Voyages would I go, nor fcarce ever above a
Stone's Caft or two from the Shore, I was fo appre-
henfive of being hurried out of my Knowledge a-
gain by the Currents or Winds, or any other Acci-
dent : But now I come to a new Scene of my Life.
It happen'd one Day about Noon going towards
my Boat, I was exceedingly furpriz'd with the Print
of a Man's naked Foot on the Shore, which was
very plain to be feen in the Sand : I flood like one
Thunder-ftruck, or as if I had feen an Apparition;
I liften'd, I look'd round me, I could hear nothing,
nor fee any Thing; I went up to a rifing Ground to
look farther ; I went up the Shore and down the
Shore, but it was all one, I could fee no other
N 3 Impreffion
Impreflion but that one, I went tp it again to fe?
jf there were any more, and to obferve if it might
not be my Fancy; but there was no Room for
that, for there was exactly the very Print of a Foot,
Toe?, Heel, and every fart of a Foot; how it
came thither, I knew not, nor could in the leaft
imagine. But after innumerable fluttering Thoughts,
like a Man perfectly cpnfus'd and out of myfelf, I
came Home to my Fortification) not feeling, as we
fay, the Ground I went on, but terrify.d to the laft ,
Degree, looking behind me at every twp or three I
Seeps, miftaking every Bufh and Tree, and fancy-
ing every Stump at a Diilance to be a Man; nor is
it poffible to defcribe how many various Shapes af-
frighted Imagination reprefented Things to me in;
how many wild Ideas were found every Moment
in my Fancy, and what ftrange unaccountable
Whimfies came into my Thoughts by the Way.
' When I came to my Caftle, for fo I think I call'd
it ever after this, I fled into it like one purfued;
whether 1 went over by the Ladder as firft con-
triv'd, or went in at the Hole in the Rock, which
J call'd a Poor, I cannot remember; no, nor could
I remember the next Morning; for never frighted
Hare fled to Cover, or Fox to Earth, with more
Terror of Mind than I to this Retreat.
I flept none that Night; the farther I was from
the Occafion of my Fright, the greater my Ap1
prehehfions were; which is fomething contrary to
the Nature of fuch Things, and efpecially to the
ufual Practice of all preatures in Fear: But I was
fo embarrafs'd with my own frightful Ideas of the
*Thing, that I form'd nothing but difmal Imagina-
tions to rhyfeif", even tho' I was now a great way
'pff it. Sometimes I fancy<I it m»ft be the De-
yil; and Reafon joyn'd in with me upon this Sup-
pofition: For how fhould any other Thirg in hu-
mane
mane Shape come into the Place ? Where was the
Veflel that brought them ? What Marks was there
of" any other Footfteps ? And how was it poflible
a Man fhould come there ? But then to think that
Satan fhould take humane Shape upon him in fuch a
Place where there could be no manner of Occafion
for it, but to leave the Print of his Foot behind
him, and that even for no Purpofe too, for he could
not be fure I fhould fee it; this was an Amufement
the other Way : I confidered that the Devil might
have found out abundance of other Ways to have
terrify'd me than this of the fingle Print of a Foot.
That as I liv'd quite on the other Side of the Ifland,
he would never have been fo fimple to leave a Mark
in a Place where it was ten Thoufand to one whe-
ther I fhould ever fee it or not, and in the Sand
too, which the firft Surge of the Sea upon a high
Wind would have defac'd entirely : All this feem'd
inconfiftent with the Thing itfelf, and with all the
- Notions we ufually entertain of the Subtilty of the
Devil.
Abundance of fuch Things as thefe affifted to ar-
gue me out of all Apprehenfions of its being the
Devil: And I prefently concluded then, that it muft
be fome more dangerous Creature, viz.. That it
muft be fome of the Savages of the main Land
over-againft me, who had wandered out to Sea in
their Canoes, and either driven by the Currents, or
by contrary Winds, had made the Ifland ; and had
been on Shore, but were gone away again to Sea,
being as loth, perhaps, to have ftaid in this defo-
late Ifland, as I would have been to have had them.
While thefe Reflections were rolling upon my
Mind, I was very thankful in my Thoughts, that
I was fo happy as not to be thereabouts at that
Time, or that they did not fee my Boat, by which
they would have concluded that fome Inhabitants
N 4 had
had been in the Place, and perhaps have fearch'd
farther for me : Then terrible Thoughts rack'd my
Imagination about their having found my Boat,
and that there were People here; and that if fo, I
fhould certainly have them come again in greater
Numbers and devour me ; that if it mould happen
Co that they mould not find me, yet they would
find my Enclofure, deflroy all my Corn, carry away
ill my Flock of tame Goats, and I fhould perifh at
aft for meer Want.
Thus my Fear banifh'd all my Religious Hope,
ill that former Confidence in God, which was
founded upon fuch wonderful Experience as I had
riad of his Goodnefs, now vanifh'd; as if he that
ud fed me by Miracle hitherto, could not preferve
jy his Power the Provifion which he had made for
ne by his Goodnefs : I reproach'd my felf with my
Eafinefs, that would not fow any more Corn one
Year than would juft ferve me till the next Seafon,
is if no Accident could intervene to prevent my
enjoying the Crop that was upon the Ground ;
ind this I thought fo ju/l a Reproof, that I refolv'd
"or the future to have two or three Years Corn be-
bre-hand, fo that whatever might come, I might
lot perifh for want of Bread.
How ftrange a Chequer-Work of Providence is
•he Life of Man! and by what fecret differing
Springs are the Affections hurried about, as differ-
ng Circumftances prefent! To Day we love what
o Morrow we hate ; to Day we feek what to Mor-
•ow we fhun ; to Day we defire what to Morrow
ve fear; nay, even tremble at the Apprehenfions of,
This was exemplified in me at this time in the
noft lively Manner imaginable; for I, whofe only
^.ffliaion was, that I feem'd banifh'd from humane
Society, that I was alone circumfcrib'd by the
(oundlefs Ocean, cut off from Mankind, and con-
demn'd.
demn'd to what I call .filent Life; that I was as
one whom Heaven thought not worthy to be num-
ber'd among the Living, or to appear among the
reft of his Creatures ; that to have feen one of my
own Species, would have feem'd to me a Raifing
me from Death to Life, and the greateft Blefllng
that Heaven it felf, next to the fupreme Blefling of
Salvation, could beftow; I fay, that I fhould now
tremble at the very Apprehenfions of feeing a Man,
and was ready to fink into the Ground at but the
Shadow, or filent Appearance of a Man's having
fet his Foot on the Bland.
Such is the uneven State of Humane Life; and it
afforded me a great many curious Speculations af-
terwards, when I had a little recovered my firft
Surprize ; I confidered that this was the Station of
Lifej the infinitely wife and good Providence of
God had determm'd for me, that as I could not
forefee what the Ends of Divine Wifdom might be
in all this, fo I was not to difpute his Sovereignty,
who, as I was his Creature, had an undoubted
Right by Creation to govern and difpofe of me ab-
folutely as he thought fit ; and who, as I was a
Creature who had offended him, had likewife a ju-
dicial Right to condemn me to whaj: Punifhment
he thought fit; and that it was my part to fubmit
to bear his Indignation, becaufe I had fin'd againft
him.
I then reflected, that God, who was not only
Righteous but Omnipotent, as he had thought
fit thus to punifh and afRicT: me, fo he was able
to deliver me ; that if he did not think fit to do it,
'twas my unqueftion'd Duty to refign my felf abfo-
lutely and entirely to his Will : And on the other
hand, it was my Duty alfo to hope in him, pray
to him, and quietly to attend the Dictates and Di-
j-e&ions of his daily Providence.
Thefe
nay, I may fay, Weeks and Months; and one par-
ticular Efted of my Cogitations on this Occafion,
I cannot omit, viz.. One Morning early, lying in
my Bed, and fill'd with Thought about my Danger
from the Appearance of Savages, I found it dif-
compos'd rae very much; upon which thofe Words
of the Scripture came into my Thoughts, Call up-
on me in the Day of "Trouble, and I will deliver, and that
Jbalt glorify me.
Upon this, rifing chearfully out of my Bed, my
Heart was not only comforted, but I was gujded
and encouraged to pray earneftly to God for Deli"
verance : When I had done praying, I took up my
Bible, and opening it to read, the firft Words that
presented to me, were, Wait on the Lord, and be of
good Cheer, and be Jball ftrengthea thy Heart; -wait, 1
fay, on the Lord. It is impoffible to exprefs the Com-
fort this gave me. In Anfwer, I thankfully laid
down the Book, and was no more fad, at leaft, not
on that Occafion.
In the middle of thcfe Cogitations, Apprehcn-
fions and Reflections, it came into my Thought one
Day, that all this might be a meer Chimera of my
own; and that this Foot might be the Print of my
own Foot, when I came on Shore from my Boat:
This chear'd me up a little too, and I began to per-
fwade myfelf it was all a-Delation ; that it was no-
thing elfe but my owflToot; and why might not I
come that Way^fom the Boat, as well as I was go-
ing that Way t(f the Boat ? Again, I confider'd alfo
that I could byino Means tell for certain where I
had trod, and w$ere I had not; and that if at laft
this was only the Print of my own Foot, I had
play'd the Part of thofe Fools, who ftrive to make
Stories of Spe&res and Apparitions, and then are
frighted at them more than any body.
Now
INfow I began to take Courage, and to peep abroad
again; for I had not ftir'd out of my Caftle for three
Pays and Nights; fo that I began to ftarve for
Provifion; for I had little or nothing within Doors,
but fome Barley Cakes and Water. Then I knew
that my Goats wanted to be milk'd too, which
ufually was my Evening Diverfion; and the poor
Creatures were in great Pain and Inconvenience for
want of it; and indeed, it almoft fpoil'd fome of
them, and almoft dry'd up their Milk.
Heartning myfelf therefore with the Belief that
this ;was nothing but the Print of one of my own
Feet*and fo I might be truly faid to ftart at my
own Shadow, I began to go abroad again, and
went to my Country Houfe, to milk my Flock ; but
to fee with what Fear I went forward, how often I
look'd behind me, how I was ready every now and
then to lay down my Basket, and run for my Life, it
would have made any one have thought I was haunt-
ed with an evil Conference, or that I had been late-
ly moft terribly frighted, and fo indeed I had.
However, as I went down thus two or three
Days, and having feen nothing, I began to be a lit-
tle bolder; and to think there was really nothing in
it, but my own Imagination: But I could not per-
fwade myfelf fully of this, till I {hould go down to
the Shore again, and fee this Print of a Foot, and
meafure it by my own, and fee if there was any Si-
militude or Fitnefs, that I might be aflur'd it was
my own Foot: But when I came to the Place,
Ftrft, it appeared evidently to me, that when I laid
up my Boat, I could not poflibly be on Shore any
where thereabout. Secondly, When I came to mea-
{ure the Mark with my own Foot, I found my Foot
hot fo large by a great deal; both thefe Things filTd
my Head with new Imaginations, and gave me the
Vapours again to the higheft Degree; fo that I
(hook
Home again, fill'd with the Belief" that fome Man
or Men had been on Shore there ; or, in fhort, that
the Itland was inhabited, and I might be furpriz'd
before I was aware; and what Courfe to take for
my Security, I knew not.
O what ridiculous Refolutions Men take, when
poflefs'd with Fear! it deprives them of the Ufeof
thofe Means which Reafon offers for their Relief.
The firft Thing I propos'd to my felf, was, to
throw down my Enclofures, and turn all my tame
Cattle wild into the Woods, that the Enemy might
not find them, and then frequent the Ifland in prof-
pea of the fame, or the like Booty ; then to the
fimple Thing of Digging up my two Corn-Fields,
that they might not find fuch a Grain there, and
ftill be prompted to frequent the Ifland; then to de-
molifh my Bower and Tent, that they might not
fee any Veftiges of Habitation, and be prompted to
look further, in order to find out the Perfons in-
habiting.
Thefe were the Subject of the firft Night's Cogi-
tation, after I was come home again, while the
Apprehenfions which had fo over-run my Mind
were frefli upon me, and my Head was full of Va-
pours, as above. Thi* Fear of Danger is ten thou-
{"and times more terrifying than Danger it felt,
when apparent to the Eyes ; and we find the Bur-
then of Anxiety greater by much, than the Evil
which we are anxious about; and, which was worfe
than all this, I had not that Relief in this Trouble
from the Refignation I ufed to pra&ife, that I
hop'd to have. I look'd, I thought, like Saul, who
complain'd not only that the Philiftinei were upon
him, but that God had forfaken him; for I did not
now take due Ways to compofe my Mind, by crying
to God in my Diftrefs, and refting upon his Provi-
dence,
dence, as I had done before, for my Defence and
Deliverance; which if I had done, I had, atleaft,
been more cheerfully fupported under this new Sur-
prize, and perhaps carry'd through it with more Re-
folution.
This Confufion of my Thoughts kept me waking
all Night; but in the Morning I fell afleep, and
having, by the Amufement of my Mind, been as it
were tired, and my Spirits exhaufted, I flept very
foundly, and wak'd much better compos'd than
I had ever been before : and now I began to think
fedately; and upon the utmjpft Debate with my-
felf, I concluded, That this Ifland, which was fo
exceeding pleafant, fruitful, and no farther from the
main Land than as I had feen, was not fo entirely
abandon'd as .1 might imagine : That altho' there
were no ftated Inhabitants who liv'd on the Spot;
yet that there might fometimes come Boats off from
the Shore, wha either with Defign, or perhaps ne-
ver, but when they were driven by crofs Winds,
might come to this Place.
That I had liv'd here fifteen Years now, and had
not met with the leaft Shadow or Figure of any
People yet; and that if at any Time they fhould be
driven here, it was probable they went away again
as foon as ever they could, feeing they had never
thought fit to fix there upon any Occafion, to this
Time.
That the moft I cou'd fuggeft any Danger from,
was, from any fuch cafual accidental Landing of
ftraggling People from the Main, who, as it,was
likely if they were driven hither, were here againft
their Wills ; fo they made no ftay here, but went off
again with all poffible Speed, feldom flaying one
Night on Shore, left they fcould not have the
Help of the Tides, and Day-light back again; and
that therefore I had nothing to dp but to confider.
of
vages land upon the Spot.
Now I began forely to repent, that I had dug
my Cave fo large* as to bring a Door through
again, which Door, as I faid, came out beyond where
my Fortification joyn'd to the Rock: upon mature-
ly confidering this therefore, I refolv'd to draw me
a fecond Fortification, in the fame Manner of a
Semicircle, at a Diftanee from my Wall, juft where
I had planted a double Row of Trees, about twelvs
Years before, of which I made mention: Thefe
Trees having been planted fo thick before, they
wanted but a few riles to be driven between
them, that they fiiould be thicker, and ftronger,
and my Wall would be foon finifh'd.
So that I had now a double Wall* and my outer
Wall was thickned with Pieces of Timber, old Ca-
bles, and every Thing I could think of to make it
ftrong; having in it feven little Holes, about as
big as I might put my Arm out at. In the Infide
of this, I thickned my Wall to above ten Foot
thick, with continual bringing Earth out of my
Cave, and laying it at the Foot of the Wall, and
walking upon it; and through the feven Holes, I
contriv'd to plant the Mufquets, of which I took
Notice, that I got feven on Shore out of the Ship;
thefe, I fay, I planted like my Cannon, and fitted
them into Frames that held them like a Carriage,
that fo I could fire all the feven Guns in two Mi-
nutes time: This Wall I was many a weary Month
a finifhing, and yet never thought myfelf fafe till it
was done. .
When this was done, I ftuck all the Ground
without my Wall, for a great way every way, as
full with Stakes or Sticks of the 0/fcr-like Wood,
which I found fo apt to grow, as they could well
ftand; infomuch, that I believe I might fet in near
twenty
Space between them and my Wai], that I might
have room to fee an Enemy, and they might have
no Ihelter from the young Trees, if they attempted
to approach my outer Wall.
Thus in two Years time I had a thick Grove,
and in five or fix Years time I had a Wood before
my Dwelling, growing fo monftrous thick and
ilrong, that it was indeed perfectly impaflkble;
and no Men, of what kind foever, would ever ima-
gine that there was any Thing beyond it, much le&
a Habitation. As for the Way which I propofed to
myfelf to go in and out, for I left no Avenue, it
was by fetting two Ladders; one to a Part of the
Rock which was low, and then broke in, and left
xoom to place another Ladder upon that; fo when
the two Ladders were taken down, no Man living
could come down to me without mifchiefing him-
felf; and if they had come down, they were ftifl
on the Out-fide of my outer Wall.
Thus I took all the Meafures humane Prudence
could fuggeft for my own Prefervation; and it will
be feen at length, that they were not altogether
without juft Reafon; though I forefaw nothing at
that Time, more than my meer Fear fuggefied to
me.
While this was doing, I was not altogether cate-
lefs of my other Affairs; for I had a great Concern
upon me for my little Herd of Goats; they were
not only a prefent Supply to me upon every Occa-
fion, and began to be Sufficient to me, without the
Expence of Powder and Shot; but alfo without the
Fatigue of Hunting after the wild ones; and I was
loth to lofe the Advantage of them, and to have
them all to nurfe up over again.
To this Purpofe, after long Confideration, I
could think of but two Ways to preferve them;
one
Cave under Ground, and to drive them into it every
Night; and the other was to enclofe two or three
little Bits of Land, remote from. one another, and as
much conceal'd as I could, where I might keep about
half a Dozen young Goats in each Place: So
that if any Difafter happen'd to the Flock in gene-
ral, I might be able to raife them again with little
Trouble and Time: And this, tho' it would re-
quire a great deal of Time and Labour, I thought
was the moft rational Defign.
Accordingly I fpent fome Time to find out the
moft retir'd Parts of the Ifland; and I pitch'd up-
on one which was as private indeed as my Heart
could wifh for; it was a little damp Piece of Ground
in the middle of the Hollow and thick Woods,
where, as is obferv'd, I almoft loft myfelf once be-
fore, endeavouring to come back that Way from the
Eaftern Part of the Ifland : Here I found a clear
Piece of Land near three Acres, fo furrounded with
Woods, that it was almoft an Enclofure by Nature,
at leaft it did not want near fo much Labour to
make it fo, as the other Pieces of Ground I had
work'd fo hard at.
I immediately went to work with this Piece of
Ground, and in lefs than a Month's Time, I had
fo fenc'd it round, that my Flock or Herd, call it
which you pleafe, who were not fq wild now as at
firft they might be fuppofed to" be,' were well
enough fecur'd in it. So without any farther De-
lay, I removed ten young She-Goats and two He-
Goats to this Piece; and when they were there, I
continu'd to perfect the Fence till I had made it
as fecure as the other, which, however, I did at
more Leifure, and it took me up more Time by a
great deal,' AU
from my Apprchenfions on the Account of the Print
<3f a Man's Foot which I had feen ; for as yet I
•never faw any human Creature come near the Kland,
and I had now liv'd two Years under thefe Unea-
finefles, which indeed made my Life much lefs
comfortable than it was before; as may well be
imagin'd by any who know what it is to live in
the conftant Snare of the Fear of Man; and this I
muft obferve with Grief too, that the Difcompo-
fure of nly Mind had too great Imprcffions alfo up-
on the religious Part of my Thoughts, for the
Dread and Terror of falling into the Hands of Sa-
vages and Canibals, lay fo upon my Spirits, that
I feldom found my felf in a due Temper for Appli-
cation to' my Maker, at leaft, not with the fedate
Calmnefs and Refignation of Soul which t was
wont to do ; I rather pray'd to God as under
great Affliction and Preflure of Mind, furrounded
with Danger, • and in Expectation every Night of
Being murder'd and devour'd before Morning ;
and I muft teftify from my Experience, that a Tem-
per of PeaCe, Thankfulnefs, Love and Aftection, is
much more the proper Frartle for Prayer, than that
of Terror and Difcompofure; and that under the
Dread of Mifchief irtipending, a Man is no more
fit for a comforting Performance of the Duty of
praying to God, than he is for Repentance on a
jfick-Bcd : For thefe Difcompofures aflfect the Mind
as the others do the Body ; and the Difcompofure
of the Mind muft neceflarily be as great a Difabi-
llty as that of the Body, and much greater pray-
ing to God being properly an Act of the Mind, not
of the Body.
But to go on : After 1 had thus fecur'd'one Part
of my little living Stock, I went about the whole
HUnd, fcarehing for another private Place, to make
O •. • fuch
fuch another Depofit; when wandring more to the
Weft Point of the Ifland than I had ever done yet,
and looking out to Sea, I thought I faw a Boat up-
on the Sea, at a great Diftance ; I had found a Pro-
fpective-Glafs, or two, in one of the Seamen's
Chefts, which I fav'd out of our Ships; but I had
it not about me, and this was fo remote, that Icould
not tell what to make of it ; though I look'd at it
till my Eyes were not able to hold to look any
longer : whether it was a Boat, or not, I do not
know ; but as I defcended from the Hill, I could
fee no more of it, fo I gave it over ; only I refolv'd
to go no more out without a Profpe&ive-Glafs in
my Pocket.
When I was come down the Hill, to the End of
the Ifland, where indeed I had never been before,
I was prefently convinc'd, that the feeing the Print
of a Man's Foot, was not fuch a ftrange Thing in
the Ifland as I imagin'd ; and but that it was a fpe-
cial Providence that I was ca.il upon the Side of the
Ifland where the Savages never came, I fhould ea-
iily have known, that nothing was more frequent
than for the Canoes from the Main, when they hap-
pen'd to be a little too far out at Sea, to fhoot over
to that Side of the Ifland for Harbour; likewife as
they often met, and fought in their Canoes, the Vic-
tors having ta.ken any Prifoners, would bring them
over to this Shore, where, according to their dread-
ful Cuftoms, being all Canibals, they would kill and
cat them; of which hereafter.
When I was come down the Hifl to the Shore,
as I faid above, being the S. TV. Point ^of the
Jfland, I was perfectly con founded and amaz'dj nor
is it poflibJe for me to exprefs the Horror of n»/
Mind, at feeing the Shore fpread with Skulls,
Hands, Feet and other Bones of humane Bodies ;
and particularly I obferv'd a Place where there had
* been
like a Cockpit, where it is fuppofed the Savage
Wretches had fat down to their inhumane Feaft-
ings upon the Bodies of their Fellow-Creatures.
I was fo aflonifh'd'with the Sight of thefe Things,
that I entertain'd no Notions of any Danger to my
felf from it for a long while ; all "my Apprehen-
fions were buried in the Thoughts of fuch a Pitch of
inhumane, hellifh Brutality, and the Horror of the
^Degeneracy of Humane Nature ; which though I
.j^a,d heard of often, yet I never had fo near a View o)f
before; in fhcrt, I turn'd away my Face from the
.horrid Spectacle j my Stomach grew fick, and I
..was juil.at the point of Fainting, when Nature dii-
charg*4.ithe Diforder from my Stomach; and ha-
ving vpmited with an uncommon Violence, I was
a little reliev'd, but could not bear to ftay in the
!Place a Moment ; fo I got me up the Hill again
-.wjth ^11 the Speed I could, and.walked on towards
j^y.Qwft Habitation.,. r j ; ,;, ; y/. . •. ^
When I camera, little out of that '.part of the
Ifland, I flood ftili awhile as amaz'd'j and then re-
cotfeiing myfelf, I.look'd up with the utmoft Affec-
i..qri my Sowl* and .with a Flpo4 of Tears in my
2 God; Thanks, that ha^ ctaft my firft Lot
jf th^ World, where I w.as djftinguifhd
,^,^_,- -^ dreadful Creatures a^ thefe ;. ^and • tha.t
though I had efte.emed my pre^fent. Condition, very
.-imifcrable, had yet given me fo many.Comforts iji
it,, that I had ftill more to give thanks.jfo,r than ^)
cowpkin ofj and this above all^thaf J had even
in this miferabl^e Condition been .comforted witji
.. the .KnovvJedge of himfelf, and the H,ope of h(s
.. Bleging, which was a Felicity more than fuffieienij*
ly equivalent.to all the Mifery which I
 In this Frame of Thankfulnefs, I went Home to
my Gallic, and began to be much eafier now, as
to the Safety of my Circumftances, than ever I was
before ; for I obferv'd that thefe Wretches never
came to this Ifland in fearch of what they could
get ; perhaps not feeding, nor wanting, or not ex-
pecting any thing here ; and having often, no doubt,
been up in the cover'd woody Part of it, without
finding any Thing to their Purpofe. I knew I had
been here now almoit eighteen Years, and never
faw the leaft Footfteps of Humane Creature there
before ; and I might be here eighteen more, as en-
tirely conceal'd, as I was now, if I did not difcover
my felf to them, which I had no manner of Occa-
iion to do, it being my only Bufinefs to keep my
felf entirely concealed where I was, unlefs I found
a better fort of Creatures than Canibals to make my
fell" known to.
Yet I entertain'd fuch an Abhorrence of the Sa-
vage Wretches that I have been fpeaking of, and of
the wretched inhumane Cuftom of their devouring
and eating one another up, that I continu'd penfive,
and fad, and kept clofe within my own Circle
for almoft two Years after this : When I fay my
own Circle, I mean by it, my three Plantations,
vis., my Caftle, my Country-Seat, which I cali'd
my Bower, and my Enclofure in the Woods ; nor
did I look after this for any other Ufe than as an
Enclofure for my Goats ; for the Averfion which
Nature gave me to thefe heilifh Wretches, was
fuch, that I was fearful of feeing them, as of feeing
the Devil himielf ; nor did I fo much as go to look
ifter my Boat in all this time, but began rather
:o think of making me another; for I could not
rhink of ever making any more Attempts to bring
:he other Boat round the Ifland to me, left .I
Jiould meet with fome of thefe Creatures at Sea,
w
Hands, I knew what would have been my Lot.
Time however, and the Satisfaction I had, that
1 was in no Danger of being difcovered by thefe
People, began to wear ofl" my Uneafinefs about
them; and I began to live juft in the fame compos'd
Manner as before; only with this Difference, that
I ufed more Caution, and kept my Eyes more about
me than I did before, left I (hould happen to
jbe feen by any of them; and particularly, I was
jnore cautious of firing my Gun, left any of them
being on the Ifland, fliould happen to hear of it;
and it was therefore a very good Providence to me,
that I had furniflrd myfelf. with a tame Breed of
Goats, that I needed not hunt any more about the
Woods, or fhoot at them; and if I did catch any
of them, after this it was by Traps, and Snares, as
I had done before; fo that for two Years after this,
I believe I never fir'd my Gun once off, though I
never went out without it; and which was more,
as I had fav'd three Piffols out of the Ship, I al-
ways carried them out with me, or at leaft two of
them, (ticking them in my Goat-Skin Belt; alfo I
furbifli'd up one of the great Cutlafhes, that I had
out of the Ship, and made me a Belt to put it on
alfo; fo that I was now a moft formidable Fellow
to look at, when I went abroad, if you add to
the former Defcription of myfelf, the Particular of
two Piftols, and a great broad Sword hanging at
my Side in a Belt, but without a Scabbard. <;
Things going on thus, as J have faid, for fomc
Time; I feem'd, excepting thefe Cautions, to be
reduc'd to my former calm, fedate way of Living,
all thefe Things tended to {hewing me more and
more how for my Condition was from being miJe-
table, compared to fome others; nay, to many
Other Particulars of Life, which it might have plea-
fed God to have made my Lot- It put me uppn;
reflecting, how little repining there would be .#?'
ipong Mankind, at any Condition of Life, if Peo-
ple would rather compare their Condition with"
thofe that are worfe, in order to be thankful, than
be always comparing them with thofe which arc'
better, to affift their Murmurings and Complain-
ings.
* As in my prefent Condition there were not really
many Things which I wanted; fo indeed I thought
that the Frights I had been in about thefe Savage
Wretches, and the Concern I had been in for my
dwn Prefervation, had taken off the Edge of my ti-
yentionfor my own Conveniences; and I haddropp'
•i good Defign, which I had once bent my Thoughts
too much upon;' and that was, to try if I could not
make fome of my Barley into Malt, and then try to.
t^rew myfelf fome Beer : This was really a whim-'
fical Thought, and I reprov'd myfelf often for the
Simplicity pf it; for I prefently' few there would/
be the Want of feveral Things '• neceffary to the
making my Beer, that it would be impoffible for
iye to fnpply : As firft, Casks to preferve it in,
which was a Thing, that as I have obferv'dalfea*'
fdy, I could never cpmpafs; no, though I fpent not
many Days, but Weeks, tray Months, in attempt-; f
jngjt, but to no purpofe. In the next place, I haty j
noHpps to make it keep, no Yeaft to make jt work,;
no Copper or Kettle to make it boil; and yet all
tjiefe Things, nptwithftanding, I verily ' believe,'
had not thefe Tilings interven'd, J mean tlie Fright^,
and Terrprs I was in about the'"$avages, thactun^
dertaken it,. and perhaps brought it to pafstop.
fpr I feldpm gave any thing over withdut accon^'
plifliingit, when"! piiCe had it in; my;Head enough
B«ff
But my Invention now run quite another Way;
for Night and Day I could think of nothing but
how I might deftroy fome of thefe Monftersin their
cruel bloody Entertainment, and, if poffible, fave
the Victim they mouldering hither to deftroy. It
would take up a larger Volume than this whole
Work is intended to be, to fet down all the Con-
trivances I hatch'd, or rather brooded upon in my
Thought, for the deftroying thefe Creatures, or at
Jeaft frighting them, fo as to prevent their coming
hither any more ; but all was abortive, nothing
could be poffible to take effect, nnlefs I was to be
there to do it my felf; and what could one Man
dp among them, when perhaps there might be
twenty or thirty of them together, with their
Darts, or their Bows and Arrows, with which
they could fhoot as true to a Mark, as I could with
my GUJI?
Sometimes I contrived to dig a Hole under the
Place where they made their Fire, and put in Five
or Six Pound of Gun-powder, which, when they
kindled their Fire, would confequently take Fire,
and blow up all that was near it; but as in the firft
Place I fhould be very loth to wafte Jo.much Powder
upon them, my Store being now within the Quan-
tity of one Barrel ., fo neither could I be fure of its
going oft" at any certain time, when it might fur-
prize them, and at beft, that it would clo little' more
than ;uft blow the Fire about their Ears and fright
them, but not fufficient to make them forfake the
Place ; fp J laid' it'afide, and t^ien propos'd, that
I would place my felf in Ambufh, in fome con-
venient Place, with my three Quns, all double
loaded; aud in fh'e ihicldle of "their .bloody Cere-
mony, let fly at them, when I fhould be fure to kill
or wound perhaps two or three at every Shoot; and
then falling in upon them' with my three. Piflols,
Q " .and
find my Sword, J made no doubt but that if there.
was twenty, I fhould kill them all. This Fancy
pleas'd my Thoughts for fome Weeks, and I was Ip
full of it, that I often dream'd of it; and fometimes
that I was juft going tp let fly at them in my Sleep.
j' I went fp far with it in my Imagination, that J
f mploy'd my felf feveral Days to find out proper
places to put my felf in Ambufcade, as I fald, tp
watch for them ; and I went frequently to the Place
it felf, which was now grown more familiar to
me ; and efpecially while my Mind was thus fill'd
with Thoughts of Revenge, and of a bloody put-
ting twenty or thirty of them to the Sword, as I
may call it; the Horror I had at the Place, and
at the Signals of the barbarous Wretches devouring
one another, abated my Malice.
Well, at length I found a Place in the Side of
the Hill, where I was fatisfy'd I might fecurely
wait, till I faw any of their Boats coming, anjl
might then, even before they would be ready to
come on Shore, convey my felt unfeen into Thickets
' of Trees, in ope of which there was a hollow

. might fit and obferve all their bloody Doings, and,
'take my full aim at their jleads, when they were
Co clofe together, as that it would be next to im-
jpoflible that I fhould mifs my Shoot, or that I could
fail wounding three or foiir pf them at the firft
Shopt.'
'-. In this Place then I refolv'd to fix my Defign,
and Accordingly I prepar'd two Muskets and my
prdmary Fpwling-Pieqe, The two Muskets 1
* . loaded with a ^race' pf Slugs each, and four or five
jfmalter gullets, about the Size of Piftol-Bulfets;
and'the Fowling-Piece I loaded with near a Hand-
- ful pf jSwau-Shot; of the largeftSize; I alfo Ioade4
' my PiMs'wM about four Bullefs each; and in this
re
Pofture, well provided with Ammunition for a fe-
,cond and third Charge, I prepar'd my felf for my
Expedition. . i. v ., . , ,• . ..
After I had thus laid the Scheme of my Defign,
and in my Imagination put it in Practice, I conti-
nually made my Tour every Morning up to the
Top ef the Hil), which was from my Caftle, as I
call'd it, about three Miles, or more, to fee if I
could obferve any Boats upon the Sea, coming near
rhe I/land, or ftanding over towards it; but I be-
gan to tire of this hard Duty, after I had for two
or three Months cpnftantly kept my Watch ; but
came always back without any Difcovery, there
having not in all that Time been the leaft Appear-
ance, not only on, or near the Shore, but not on
the whole pcean, fo far as my Eyes or Glafles
could reach every Way.
As long as I kept up my daily Tour to the Hill
to look out, fo long alfo I kept up the Vigour of
my Defign, and my Spirits feem'd to be all the
while in a fuitable Form for fo outragiousan Exe-
cution as the killing twenty or thirty naked Savages,
for an Offence which I had not at all entred into a
Pifcuffion of in my Thoughts, any farther than my
Paflions were at firft fir'd by the Horror I conceiv'd
at the unnatural Cuftom of that People of the Coun-
try, who, it feems, had been fuflfcr'd by Providence,
in his wife Difpofition of the World, to have no
other Guide than that of their own abominable and
vitiated Faffions; and confeqttently were left, and
perhaps had been fo for fome Ages, to act fuch
horrid Things, and receive fuch dreadful Cuf-
voms, as nothing but >Jature entirely abandon'd
of Heaven, and a&ed by fome Hellifh Degeneracy,
.. could have run then* into : But now when, as I
•„. i have faid, I began to be weary of the fruitless Ex-
' •fprfipn which.I had made fo long, a«4 fo tar, eve-
W
itfelf began to alter, and I began with cooler and
calmer Thoughts to confider what it was I was go-
ing to engage in. What Authority or Call I had,
to pretend to be Judge and Executioner upon thefe
Men as Criminals, whom Heaven had thought fit
for fo many Ages to fufler unpunifh'd, to go on,
and to be, as it were, the Executioners of his Judg-
ments one upon another. How far thefe People
were Offenders againfl me, and what Right I had
to engage in the Quarrel of that Blood, which they
fiied promifcuoudy one upon another. I debated
this very often with my felf thus; How do I know
what God himfelf judges in this particular Cafe? it
is certain thefe People either do not commit this as
a Crime; it. is not againft their own Confciences
reproving, or their Light reproaching them. They
do not know it to be an Oftence, and then commit
it in Defiance of Divine, Jufticc, as wedoinalmoll
all the Sins we .commit. They think it no more a
•Crime to kill a Captive taken in War, than we do
to kill40, Ox; nor to eat humane Flefh, than we
do to cat Mutton.
. When I had confider'd this a little, it follow'd
neceflarily, that I was certainly in the Wrong in
it; that thefe People were not Murderers in the
Senfe that I had before condemned them in my
• Thoughts, any more than thofe Chriftians were
Murderers, who often put to Death the Prifoners
taken in Battel; or more frequently, upon manv
Occafions, put whole Troops of Men to the Sword,
without giving Quarter, though they threw down
their Arms and fubmitted.
In the next place itoccur'd to me,, that albeit the
. Ufuage they thus gave one another, was thus brutifh
?Lnd inhumane, yet it was really nothing to me!
.""Thefe Pepple had. d.on.eme no Injury : TJut if they
v. » attempted
Attempted me", orl'fa-Vit nfeceflary for my imme-
diate Prefervation to Fall upon them, fomething
might be {"aid for it; but'that as I was yet out of
their Power,' and they had really no Knowledge
of me, and corifequently no Defign upon me;
therefore it could not be juft for me to fall upon
them. That this wou'd juftify the Conduct of the
Spaniards in all their Barbarities practis'd in Ame-
rica, and where' they deftroyed Millions of thefe
People, who, however they were Idolaters and Bar-
barians, and had feveral bloody and barbarous
Rites in their Cuftoms, fuch as facrificing humane
Bodies to their Idols, were yet, as to the Spaniards,
very innocent People ; and that the rooting them
out of the Country, is fpoken of with the utmoft
Abhorrence and Deteftation, by even the Sfaniardi
themfelves; at this time, and by all other Chrifli-
ah Nations of Europe, as a nicer Butchery, a bloo-
dy and unnatural Piece of Cruelty, tinjuftifiable ei->
ther to God or Man; and fuch, as for which the ve-
ry Name of a Spaniard is reckon'd to be' frightful
and terrible to allPeople of Humanity, or of Chrif-
tian Compaffion : As if the Kingdom of Spain were
particularly eminent for the Product of a Race o£
Men, who were without Principles of Tendernefs,
pr the commoti Bowels of Pity to the Miferable,
w.hich'is fedbfi'd to be a Mark of generous Tem-
per in the' Mind.
• Thefe Gonfi'derations realljr put me to a Paufe,
arid to a,feihd of a Full-flop ,* and I began by little
aird.Hf'rie.to be off of my Defign, and to conclude,
I had taken wrong Meafures in my Refolutions to
attack the.Savages; that it was not my Buiinefs to
ifte'ddle'w|thriHem, unlefs they firft attack'd me,
^hirf this'ic^raisiriyBufiriefs if poffible to prevent,'
but that if.1 were difcover'd; and ^ttack'd, then I
-."" 'rv ••'''' •" '•* :
 On the other hand, I argu'd with myfelf, That
this really was the way not to deliver myfelf, but
entirely to ruin and deftroy myfelf j for unlefs I was
fure to kill every one that not only fhould be oa
Shore at that time, but that fhould ever come on
Shore afterwards, if but one of them efcap'd, to
tell their Country People what had happen'd, they
would come over again by Thoufands to re*
venge the Death. of their Fellows, and I fhould
only bring upon myfelf a certain Deftru&ion,
which at prefent I had no manner of occ/ion
for.
Upon the whole I concluded, That neither in
Principles, nor in Policy, I ought one way or other to
concern myfelf in this Affair. That my Bufinefs
was by all poffible Means to conceal myfelf from
them, and not to leave the leaft Signal to them to
guefs by, that there were any living Creatures up-
on the Ifland; I mean of humane Shape,
Religion joyn'd in with this Prudential, and I was
convinc'd now many Ways, that I was perfeftly out
of my Duty, when I was laying all my bloody
Scfiemes for the Deftruction ofinnocent Creatures,
I mean innocent as to me : As to the Crimes they
were guilty of towards one another, I had nothing
to do with them; they were National, and I ought
to leave them to the Juftice of God, who is the
Governour of Nations, ana knows how by Na-
tional Puniflnnents to make a juft Retribution for
National Offences ; and to bring publick Judg*
men ts upon thofe who offend in a publick Manner,
by fuch Ways as beft pleafes him.
This appear'd fo clear to me now, that nothing
was a greater Satisfaction to me, than that I had.
not been fuffer'd to do a.Thing which I now few
fo much Reafdn. to believe would have been no lefs
j*. Sin, than that of wilful Murder, jf| had flim*
Kitted
mitted it; and I gave moft humble Thanks on my
Knees to God, that had thus delivered me from
Blood-guiltinefs, befeeching him to grant me the
Protection of his Providence, that I might not fall
into the Hands of the Barbarians; or that I might
not lay my Hands upon them, unlefs I had a more
clear Call from Heaven to do it, in Defence of my
own Life.
In this Di/pofition I continued for near a Year
after this ; and fo far was I from defiring an Oc-
cafion for falling upon thefe Wretches, that in all
that Time I never once went up the Hill to fee
.whether there were any of them in fight, or to
know whether any of them had been on Shore
there, or not, that I might not be tempted to re-
new any of my Contrivances againft them, or be
provoked by any Advantage which might prefent it
felf, to fall upon them; only this I did, I went and
removed my Boat which I had on the other Side
the IQand, and carried it down to the Eaft-End of
the whole Ifland, where I ran it into a little Cove
.which I found under fome high Rocks, and where
I knew, by reafon of the Currents, the Savages durft
not, at leaft would not come with their Boats,
upon any Account whatibever.
With my Boat I carried away every Thing that
I had left there belonging to her, though not ne-
ceflary for the bare going thither, w*. a Maft and
Sail which I had made for her, and a Thing like
an Anchor, but indeed which could not be call'd
either Anchor or Grapling; however, it was the
bell I could make of its kind. All thefe I remo-
ved, that there might not be the leaft Shadow of
any Difcovery, or any Appearance of any Boat,
or of any Humane Habitation upon the Ifland.
Befides this, I kept my felf, as I faid, more re-
tired dun, ever, and feldom went from my Cell, o-
thec
milk my She-Goats, and manage, my little Flock in
the Wood; which as itwas quiteon the.other Part
of the Ifland, was quite out of Danger ; for .certain
it is, that thefe Savage People, who fometimeg
haunted this Ifland, never came with any Thoughts
of finding any thing here; and confequently.; never
wandred off from the Coaft ; and I doubt not, bitf
they might.have been federal times.'on, more, after
my Apprehenfions of them had made me cautious a£
well. as before; and ,indeedr 1 look'd back with
fome Horror upon the -Thoughts of what my CQPT
dition .would have been, if I had ehop'd upon them-,
and been difcover'd before that, .when .naked and
.unarm'd, except with one Gun, and.that loaitefl
often only.: with final! Shot. I walk'd everywhere
peeping arid peeping abont thelfland,. to fee what
I could get;. what a Surprife fhouldYl ha^e beentjrb
if wheri I jdifcover'd the^Print of a Maa's, Foot, I
had ijiftead of that feen fifteen x>r. twenty Savages,
and found them purfuing me, and by thei Swiftn^fe

.them ?. . . . j::"iir.Ov.;. .j T^ESJ ,d ..v ;.vl
t,:.The Thoughts of this fometimes funk my verjr
Soul within me, and diftrefs'd my Mind fo much
••that-I,could not foon recover it, to think what I
fhould have done,! and.how I not. only fhould ntft
ha,ye bpen,able to refift them, .but; e^en fhould not
have had Prefencq ofMind enough.t6 :do what \
might hawc done; much lefs, what:npw afiedo
much Gonfideration and Preparation: I .might be a-
.ble co;d<s:. Indeed, after ferious thinking .of: thefe
Things, I fhould be very melancholy,: and foroe-
times it would laft a great while; but I refolv'd it
at laft all into Thankfialnjefs to that Providence,
which had deliver'd me from fo many uofeen Dan-
fers, and had kept raeftomthofe Mifchiefs whiah
•;;-u . .'•. I could
my felf from ; becaufe I had not the leaft notion of
any fuch thing depending, or the leaft Suppofition
of it being poffible.
This renew'd a Contemplation, which oftenjiad
come td my Thoughts in former Time, whenfirft
I began to fee the merciful Difpofitions of Heaven,'
in the Dangers we run through in this Life. How
wonderfully we are deliver'd, when we know no-
thing of it. How, when we are in (a Quandary, as
we call it) a Doubt or Hefitation, whether to go
this Way, or that Way, a fecret Hint mall direct
us this Way, when we intended to go that Way;
nay, when Senfe, our own Inclination, and perhaps
Bufinefs has call'd to go the other Way, yet arrange
Impreffron upon the Mind, from we know not what
Springs,' and by we knOto not what Power, '{hall o-
ver-rule us to go this Way; and itihaUafterwards
.appear, tharhad'we gone that Way which wefhould
have gone, and even to bur Imagination ought to
have gone, we mould have. been ruin'd and loft.
Upon thefe, and many like Reflections, I after-
wards made it a certain Rule with me, That when-
ever I found thofe fecret Hints, or Preffings of my
Mind, to doing, or not doing any Thing that pre-
fented; or to going this Way, or that Way, I nevet
fail'd to obey the fecret Di&ate j though I knew no
other Reafon for it, than that fuch a Preflfure, or
fuch a Hint hung upon my Mind: I could give ma-
ny Examples of the Succefs of this Conduct in the
Courfe of my Life; but more efpecially in the lat-
ter Part of my inhabiting this unhappy Ifland ; be-
fides many .Otcafions which it is very likely I might
have taken notice of, if I had feen with the feme
Eyes then, that I law with.now: But'tis never too
late to be wife ; and I cannot but advife all confi-
de ling Men, whofe Lives arc attended with fuch ex-
'•:." .. traordinary
traordinary Incidents as m'ine, or even though not
fo extraordinary, not to flight fuch fccret Intima-
tions of Providence, let them come from what invifi-
ble Intelligence they will, that I {hall not.difcufs,
and perhaps cannot account for; but certainly they
are a Proof of the Converfe of Spirits, and the fe-
cret Communication between thofe embody'd, and
thofe unembody'd ; and fuch a Proof as can never
be withftood : Of which 1 fhall have Occafion to
give fome very remarkable Inftances, in the Re-
mainder of my folitary Refidence in this difinal
Place.
I believe the Reader of this will not think
ftrange, if I contefs that thefe Anxieties, thefe con-
ftant Dangers I liv'd in, and the Concern that was
now upon me, put an End to all Invention, and to
all the Contrivances that I had laid for my future
Accommodations and Conveniences. I had the
Care of my Safety more now upon my Hands, than
that of my Food. I car'd not to drive a Nail, or
chop a Stick of Wood now, for fear the Noife I
fljould make, mould be heard; much lefs would I
fire a Gun, for the fame Reafon; and above all, I
was intolerably uneafy at making any Fire, left
the Smoke, which is vifible at a great Diftance in the
Day, fhould betray me ; and for this Reafon I re-
mov'd that Part of my Bufincfs which requirM Firtfi
fuch as burning of Pots and Pipes, &c. into my
new Apartment in the Woods, where, after I had
been fome time, I found, to my unfpeakable Confo-
lation, a mtcr natural Cave in the Earth, which
went in a vaft Way, and where, I dare fay, no Sa-
vage had been at the Mouth of it, or would be fo
hardy as to venture in, nor indeed v. ould any Man
:elfe, but one who, like me, wanted nothing fomuch
as 4 fate Retreat.
of a great Rock, where by meet Accident (I would
fay, if I did not fee abundant Reafon to afcribe
all fuch Things now to Providence) I was cutting
down fome thick Branches of Trees to make
Charcoal ; and before I go on, I muft obferve the
Reafon" of my making this Charcoal, which was
thus »•;•'
I was afraid of making a Smoke about my Ha-
bitation, as I faid before ; and yet I could not live
there without baking my Bread, cooking my Meat,
&(?. fo I cotttriv'd to burn fome Wood here, as I
had feen done in'England, under Turf, till it be-
tame Chark, or dry Coal; and then putting the
Fire out, I prefeiVd the Coal to carry Home, and
perform the ocher Services, which Fire was want-
ing for at Home, without Danger of Smoke. ~*~
'- .rBut this by the byk While I' was cutting down
folne Wood herei,' 1 perceiv'd that behind a very
thick. Branch of low Brufhwood, or Underwood,
ttyere was a kind of hollow Place. I was curious
to Took into it; and getting with Difficulty into
the 'Mouth of it, I found it was pretty large, that
is to fay, fufficient for me to {land uptight in it;
and perhaps another with me; but I muft confefs
tot you I made more hafte out than I did in, when
looking farther into" the Place, and which was
perfectly dark, J. faw two broad mining Eyes of
fome Creature, whether Devil or Man, I knew
not,. which twinkled like two Stars, the dim Light
from the Cave's Mouth fhining diredtly in, and
making the Reflection.
However, after fome Paufe, I recover'd my/felf,
arid began to call my felf a thoufand Fools, and
relJ my felf, that he that was" afraid.to fee the De-
vil, was not fit to live twenty Years in an liland all .
alone* and that I durft to believe there was ho-'
»'•:' P. thing
thing in this Cave that was more frightful than my
felt"; upon this, plucking up my Courage, I took
up a great Firebrand, and in I rulh'd again, with
the Stick flaming in my Hand ; I had not gone
three Steps in, but I was almoft as much frighted
as I was before; for I heard a very loud Sigh, like
that of a Man in fome Pain, and it was follow'd
by a broken Noife, as if of Words half exprefs'd,
and then a Deep Sigh again : I ftep'd back, and
was, indeed, flruck with fuch a Surprize, that it put
me into a cold Sweat; and if I had had a Hat on
my Head, I will not anfwer for it, that my Hair
might not have lifted it off. But ftill plucking up
my Spirits as well as I could, and encouraging my
felt a little, with confidering that the Power and
Prefence of God was every where, and was able
to protect me : Upcnthis I ilep'd forward again,
and by the Light of the Firebrand, holding it up
a little over my Head, I faw lying on the Ground
a moft monilrous frightful old He-goat, juft making
his Will, as we fay, and gafping for Life, and dy-
ing indeed of meer old Age.
. I fHr'd him a little, to fee if I could get him out,
and he efl'ay'd to get up, but was not able to raife
himfelf , and I thought with my felf, he might
even lie there; for if he had frighted me fo, he
would certainly fright any of the Savages, if any
of them fhould be fo hardy as to come in there,
while he had any Life in him.
I was now recover'd from my Surprize, and be-
gan to look round me, when I found the Cave was
but very fmall, that, is to fay, it might be about
twelve Foot over, but in no manner of Shape, ei-
ther round or fquare, no Hands having :ever been
employ'd in making it, but thofe of meer Nature.
I obferv'-d alfo, that there was a Place at the far-
ther Side of it, that went in farther, but was to
Jow,
low, that it requir'd me to creep upon my
and Knees to go inpo it, and whither I went I
knew not; fo having no Candle, I gave it over
for fome Time; but relblv'd to come again the
next Day provided with Candles, and, a Tinder-
box, which I had made of the Lock of one of the
Muskets, with fome Wild-fire in the Pan. . . . _
Accordingly, the next Day I came provided
with fix large Candles of my own making; for I
inade very good Candles now of Goats Tallow;
and going into this low Place, I was oblig'd to
creep upon all Fours, as I have faid, almoft tea
Yards,' which, by the way, I thought was a Ven^
ture bold enough, confidering that I knew not
how far it might go, nor what was beyond it*
When I was got through the Strait, I found the
Roof rofe higher up, I believe near twenty Foot;
but never was fuch a glorious Sight feen in the
Jfland, I dare fay, as it was, to look round the
Sides and Roof of this Vault or Cave ; the Walls
reflected a hundred thoufand Lights to me from,'
my two Candles; what it'was in the Roek, whether
Diamonds, or any other precious Stones, or Gold,
Which I rather fuppos'd it to be, I knew not.
The Place I was in, was a moft delightful Ca-
vity, or Grotto, of its Kind, as could be expected,
though perfectly dark; the Floor was dry and
level, and had a fort of fmall loofe Gravel upon
it, fo that there was no naufeous or venomous
Creature to be feen, neither was there any Damp
or wet, on the Sides or Roof: The only Difficulty
in it,was the Entrance,, which, however, as it
was a Place of. Security, and fuch a Retreat.as I
wanted, I thought that was a Convenience; fo
that; I. was really rejoyc'd at the Difcovery, and re-
folv'd, without any Delay, to bring fome of thofe
Things which I was moft anxious about to this
P » Place;
Place; particularly, I refolv'd to bring hither my
Magazine of Powder, and all my fpare Arms, -viz,.
Two Fowling-Pieces, (for I had three in all) and
three Muskets,i(for of them I had eight in all;) fa
I kept at my Caftle only five, whiclrflood ready
mounted, like Pieces of Cannon, on my outmoft
Fence ; and were ready alfo to take out upon any
Expedition.
.tlf-.on this Occafion of removing my Ammuni-
tio'',1 took Occafion to open the Barrel of Powder
T&vhich I took up out of the Sea, and which had
been wet; and 1 tound that the Water had pene-
trated about three or four Inches into the Powder
on every Side, whkh caking and growing hard,
had preferv'd the Infide like a Kernel in a Shell;
jfo that I had near fi.xty Pound of very good Pow-
der in the Centre of the Cask, and this was art
agreeable Difcovery to me at that Time; fo I car-
ry 'd all away thither, never keeping above two.
or three Pound of Powder with me in my Caftle,
for fear of a Surprize of any Kind : I alfo carry'd
thither all the Lead I had 1'efc for Bullets.
I fancy'd myfelf now like one of the ancient
Giants, which were faid to tive in Caves and Holes
in the Rocks, where none could come at them»
for I perfwaded myfelf, while I was here, if five'
hundred Savages were to hunt me, they could ne-
ver find me out ; or if they did, they would not
venture to attack me here.
The old Goat, who I found expiring, dy'd in'
the Mouth of the Cave, the next Day after I made
this Difcovery; and I found it much eafier to dig
a great Hole there, and throw him in, and cover
him with Earth, than to drag him out: So I in-
ter'd him theres to prevent Oflencc to my Nofe.
Jww
f was now in my twenty third Year of Refi-
<jlence in this Ifland, and was fo naturaliz'd to the
Place, and to the Manner of Living, that could
I have butaenjoy'd the Certainty, that no Savages
would come to the Place to difturb me, J could
have been content to have capitulated for fpen.ding
the reft of my Time there, even to the laft Mo-
ftient, till I had laid me down and dy'd, like the old
Goat in the Cave. I had alfo arriv'd to fome little
I)iverfions and Amufements, which made the Time
pafs more pleafantly with me a great deal, than
it did before; as firft, I had taught my Putt, as I
noted before, to fpeak; and he did it fo familiarly,
and talkM fo articulately and plain, that it was
V£ry pleafant to me; and he lived with me no lefs
than fix and twenty Years. How long he might.
live afterwards, I know npt j tho' I know they
have a Notion in the Brafils, that they liw a. hun-
dred Years; perhaps poor PoU may be alive there
ftilJ, calling after Pos>r Robin Crufoe to this Day. I
wifh no Englijhman the ill Luck to come there and
Hear him j but if he did, he would certainly believe
it was the Devil. My Dog was a very pleafant
and loving Companion to me for no lefs than fix-
teen Years of my Time, and then d/d of meec
pld Age; as for my Cats, they multiply'd, as I have
obferv'd, to that Degree, that I was oblig'd to {hoot
feveral of them at firft, to keep them from devour-
ing me and all I had; but at length, when the
two old ones, I brought with me, were gone, and
after fome Time continually driving them from me,
and letting them have no Provifion with me, they
all ran wild into the Woods, except two or three
Favourites, which I kept tame; and whofe Young,
when they had any, I always drown?d; and thefe
were Part of my Family. Befides thefe I always '
two or three hpufhold Kids about me, which I
P taugh?
niore Parrots which talk'd pretty well] and would
all call Robin Crufoe, but none like my firft; nor,
indeed, did I take the Pains with any of them that:
I had done with him. I had alfo feveral tame Sea-
Fowls, whofe Names J know not, who' I caught
upon the Shore, and cut their Wings j and the lit- I
tie Stakes which I had planted before my Cafile.^ tl
Wall being now grown up to a^lgbod thick Grove, 3=
thefe Fowls all liv.d among thtefc low Trees, and V
(bred there, which was very agreeable to me; fo tlj
that, as I faid above, J began to be very well con-
tented with the Life I led, if it might but have
been fecur'd from the Dread of the Savages.
But it was ptherwife directed; and it may not be
amifs for all People who {hall meet with my Story',
to make5 this juft Obfervation from it,' t//z,.'HoW
frequently, in the Courfe of our Lives, the Evil
which in itfelf we feek moil to fhun, and which,
when we are fallen into, is the moft dreadful td v?
us, is oftentimes' the very Means or Door of our it
Deliverance, by which alone we can be rais'd again 1;
from the Affliction we are fallen into. I could give , {
niany Examples of this in the Courfe of my unac- \
countable Life ; but in nothing was it more parti-
cularly' remarkable, than in the Circumftances of N
my laft Years of folitary |lefidence in this Ifland.
• It was now the Month of December, as I Hiicl above,
in my twenty third Year:; and this being the
Southern Solfiice, for Winter I cannot call it, was
the particular Time of my Harveft, and requir'a
my being pretty much abroad in the Fields ; wheii
going out pretty early in the Morning, even before
it was thorow Day-light, I was furpriz'd with fee-
ing a Light of fome Fire upon the Shore, at aDif-
ranee from me, of about two Miles towards the
Etnd of the Ifland, where I had bbferv'd foine Sa-
Side; but, to my great Affliction, it was on my
Side of the Ifland.
I was indeed terribly furpriz'd at the Sight, and
ftep'd ftiort within my Grove, not daring to go
out, left I might be furpriz'd ; and yet I had no
more Peace within, from the Apprehenfions I had,
that if thefe Savages, in rambling over the Ifland,
Ihould find my Corn {landing, or cut, or any of my
Works and Improvements, they would immediate-
ly conclude, that there were People in the Place,
and would then never give over till they had found
jne our. In this Extremity J went back directly to
pay Caftle, pnll'd up the Ladder after me, and made
all things without look as wild and natural as I
qould.
Then I prepar'd myfelf within, putting myfelf
jn a Pofture of Defence ,• I loaded all my Cannon,
as I call'd them; that is to fay, my Muskets, which
were mounted upon.my new Fortification, and all
my Piftols, and refolv'd to defend' myfelf to the
laft Gafp, not forgetting ferioufly to commend my
felf to the Divine Protection, and earneftly to pray
to God to deliver me out of the Hands of the Bar-
barians; and in this Pofture I continu'd about two
Hours, but began to be mighty impatient for In-
telligence abroad, for I had no Spies to fend out.
After fitting a while longer, and mufing what I
fhoulddo in this Cafe, I was not able to bear fit-
ting in Ignorance any longer j fo fetting up my
Ladder to the Side of the Hill, where there was a
flat Place, as I obferv'd before, and then pulling
the Ladder up after me, I fet it up again, and
mounted to the Top of the Hil), and pulling out
my Profpective-Glafs, which I had taken on pur-
ppfe, 1 laid me down flat qn my Belly on the
d^ and began to look for the Place. I prc-
P^. (ently
javages fitting round a fmaU Fire they had niadej 1
iot to warm them, for they had no need of'that, '(fa
he Weather being extreme hot; but, as I fuppos'd, At
:o drefs fome ot their barbarous Diet of humane C&
Flefh, which they had brought with them, whe-
:her alive or dead, I could not know. m;
They had two Canoes with them, which they
liad haled up upon the Shore ; and as it was then
Tide of Ebb, they feem'd to me to wait for the
Return of the Flood to go away again; it is not be
eafy to imagine what Coniuiion this Sight put me Bo
into, efpecially feeing them come on my Side the eai
Ifland, and fo near me too; but whenlobferv'd rit
their coming muft be always with the Current or at
the Ebb, I began afterwards to be more fedate ia
my Mind, being fatisfy'd that I might go abroad
with Safety all the Time of the Tide of Flood, if
they were not on Shore before: And having made
this Obfervation, I went abroad about my Hai- qu
yeft-work with the more Compofure. ffii
As I expected, fo it prov'd ; for as foon as the to
Tide made to the' Weftward, I faw them all take Si
Boat, and row (or paddle, as we call it) all away.
I fhould have obferv'd, 'that for an Hour and more
before they went off, they went to dancing, and I
could 'eaiily difcern their tottures and Geibrqs
by my Glaifes ; I could hot perceive by my nice'ft
Obfervation, but that they were Hark naked, and £
had not the leaft Covering upon them ; but whe- _jj
ther they were Men or Women, that I could not 'jj
diftinguifh.
As foqn as I faw them fhip'd and gone, I took
two Guns upon my Shoulders, and two Piftols at
jny Girdle, 'and my great Sword by my Side, with-
out a Scabbard, and with all the Speed I was able
to make, 1 went away to the Hill3 where I.had dif-
• ' ••' ' coverd
1
cover'd the firft Appearance of all; and as fbon as
I gat thither, which was not lefs than two Hours,
(for I could not go apace, being fo leaden with
Arms as I was,) I perceived there had been three
Canoes more of Savages in that Place ; and look-
ing out farther, I faw they were all at Sea together,
making over for the. Main.
This was a dreadful Sight to me, efpecially
when going down to the Shore, I could fee the
Marks of Horror which the difmal Work they had
been about, had left behind it,w'sc. the fMocd, the
feones, and Part of the Flcfh of humane Bodies,
eaten and devour'd by thofe Wretches, with Mer-
riment and Sport: I was fo fill'd with Indignation
at the Sight? that I began now to premeditate the
."Deftru&ion qf the next that I faw there, let them
be who or how many foever.'
It feem'd evident to me, that the Vifits which
they thus make to this Ifland, are not very fre-
quent ; for it was above fifteen Months before any
more of them came on Shore there again ; that is
to fay, I neither faw them, or any Footfteps, or
Signals of them, in all that Time ; for as to the
rainy Seafons, then they are fure not to come a-
broad, at leaft pot fo far; yet all this while I liv'd
uncomfortably, by reafon of theconftant Apprehen-
llons I was in of their coming upon me by Surprize;
from whence I obferve, that the Expedition of*
Evil is more bitter than the Suffering, efpecially
if there is no Room to fhake off that Expectation,
or thofe Apprehenfions.
During all this Time, I was in the murdering
Humour, and took up moft of my Hours, which
{hould have been better employ'd, in contriving
how to circumvent and fall upon them, the very
next time I Ihould fee them ; efpecially if they
jQiould be divided, as they were the'laft Time, in-
r • ' V ' * 'V ' f ••'..' ' , ' ; • ' - r
to
I kill'd one Party, fuppofe Ten or a Dozen, I was
ftill the next Day, or Week, or Month, to kill
another, and fo another, even ad infinitum, till I
ihould be at length no lefs a Murderer than they
were in being Man-eaters, and perhaps much more
fo.
I fpent my Days now in great Perplexity and
Anxiety of Mind, expecting that 1 fhould one Day
or other fall into the Hands of thefe mercilefs Crea-
tures j and if I did at any time venture abroad, it
was not without looking round me with the great.'
eft Care and Caution imaginable; and now I found
to any great Comfort, how happy it was that I
provided for a tame Flock or Herd of Goats; for
I durft not, upon any Account, fire my Gun, efpe-
cially iiear that Side of the Ifland where they ufo
ally came, left I fhould alarm the Savages; and
if they had fled from me now^ I was fure to have
them come back again with, perhaps, two or three
hundred Cannes with them in a few Days, and then
t knew what to expect.
However, I wore out a Year and three Months
nore, before I ever faw any more of the Savages,
uid then I found them again, as I fhall foon ob-
erve. It is true, they might have been there once
jr twice, but either they made no Stay, or at leaft
[ did not hear them; but in the Month of May, as
lear as I could calculate, and in my four and twcn-
ieth Year, I had a very ftrange Encounter with
hem, of which in its place.
The Perturbation of my Mind, during thisfif-
een or fixteen Months Interval, was very great;
flept unquiet, dream'd always frightful Dreams,
r,d often karted out of my Sleep in the Night: In
je Day great Troubles overwhelm'd my Mind,
nd in the Night I dream'd often of killing the
* Savages,
Savages, and of the Reafons why I might j
the doing of it:.. But to wave all this for a while,
it was in the Middle of May, on the fixteenth Day
J think, as well as my poor wooden Calendar
.would reckon; for I marled all upon the Poft ftill;
I fay, it was the fixteenth of May, that it blew a
very great Storm of Wind, all Day, with a great
deal of Lightning and Thunder, and a very foul
Night it was after it: I know not what was the
particular Occafipn of it; but as I was reading in
the Bible, and taken up with very ferious Thoughts
about my prefent Condition, I was furpriz'd with a
Norfe of a Gun, as I thought, fir'd at Sea.
This was to be fure a Surprise of'a quite diffe-
rent Nature from any I had met with befpre; for
the Notions this put into my Thoughts were quite
of another Kind. I ftarted up in the greateft Hafte
imaginable, and in a trice clapt my Ladder to the
middle Place of the Rock, and pull'd it after me,
and mounting it the fecond Time, got to the Top
of the Hill thq yery Moment that a Flafh of Fire
bid me liften for a fecond Gun, which accordingly,
in about half a Minute, I heard, and by the Sound,
knew that it was from that Part of the Sea where
1 was driven down the Current in my Boat.
I immediately cpnfider'd that this muft be fome
Ship in Djftrefs, and that they had fome Comrade,
or Ibme other Ship in Company, and fir'd thefe Guns
tor Signals of Diltrefs, and to obtain Help : 1 had
this Prefence of Mind at that Minute, as to think
that though I could not help them, it may be
they might help me; fp I brought tpgether all the
dry Woocl I cpuld get at hand, and making a good
handfome Pile, I fet it on Fire upon the Hill; the
Wood was dry, and blaz'd freely; and though the.
Wind blew very hard, yet it burnt fairly out; that
was certain, if there was any fuch Thing as a
Ship,
 Ship, they muft needs fee it, and no doubt thejf
did ; for as foon as ever ray Fire blaz'd up, I heard
another Gun, and after that feveral others, all from
the fame Quarter. I ply'd my Fire all Night long,
till Day broke ; and when it was broad Day, and
the Air clear'd up, I faw fomething at a great Dif-
tance at Sea, full Eaft of the liland, whether a
Sail, or a Hull, I could not diftinguifh, no not
with my Glafles, the Diftance was fo great, and
the Weather ftill fomething hazy alfo; at leaft it
was fo out at Sea.
I look'd frequently at it all that Day, and foon
perceiv'd that it did not move,- fo I presently con-
cluded that it was a Ship at an Anchor; and being
eager, you may be fure, to be fatisfy'd, I took my
Gun in my Hand, and run toward the South Sideof
the Ifland, to the Rocks where I had formerly been
carry'd away with the Current, and getting up
there, the Weather by this Time being perfectly
clear, I could plainly fee, to my great Sorrow, the
Wreck of a Ship caft away in the Night, upon
thofe concealed Rocks which I found when I was
out in my Boat; and which Rocks, as they check'd
the Violence of the Stream, and made a kind of
Counter Stream, or Eddy, were the Occafion of my
recovering from the moft defperate hopelefs Con-
dition that ever I had been in in all my Life.
Thus, what is one Man's Safety, is another Man s
Deftruction; for it feems thefe Men, whoever they
were, being out gf their Knowledge, and the
Rocks being wholly under Water, had been driven
upon them in the Night, the Wind blowing hard at
£. and E. N. E. Had they feen the Ifland, as 1 muft
rieceflarily fuppofe they did not, they muft, as I
thought, have erideavoi«r'd.to have fav'd themfelves
on Shore by the Help of their Boat; but their firing
of Guns for Help, efpecially when they faw, as I
• imagin'd.
 imagm'd, my Fire, fill'd me with many Thoughts.
Firft I imagin'd, that .upon feeing my Light, they
might have put themfelves", into their Boat, and
have endeavour'd to make the Shore.; but that the
Sea going very high, they might have been caft
away; other times I imagin'd, that they might
liave loft jtheir Boat before, as might be the Cafe
many Ways; as • particularly, by the Breaking of
the Sea upon their Ship, which many times obli-
ges Men to {lave, or take in Pieces their Boat;
and fometimes to throw it 6Ver Board with their
own Hands: Other times I imagin'd, they had
fome other Ship or Ships in Company, who upon
the Signals of Diftrefs they had made, had taken
them up, and carry'd them off: Other whiles I fan-
cy'd, they were ^all gone off to Sea in their Boat,
and being hurry'd away by the Current that I
had been formerly in, were .carry'd out into the
great Ocean, where there was nothing but Mifery
and Perifhing; and that-perhaps they might by*
this Time think of Starving, and of being in a.
Condition to eat one another.
As all thefe were but Conjectures at beft^ fo in
the Condition I was in, I could do no more than
look on upon the Mifery of the poor Men, and
pity them, which had ftill this good Efted on
my Side, that it gave me more and more Caufe
to give Thanks to God, who had fo happily and
Comfortably provided for me in my defolate Con-
dition; and that of two Ships Companies who were
now caft away upon this Part of the World, not
one Life {hould be fpar'd but mine: I learn'd here
again to obferve, that it is very rare that the Pro-
vidence of God cafts us into any Condition of Life
fo low, or any Mifety fo great, but we may fee
fomething or other to be thankful for; and may fee
others in worfe Cireumftances than our ow^
. - •..,.' Such
. Such certainly was the Cafe of thefe Men, 6f to
whom I could not fo much as fee Room to fup- fo
pofe any of them were fav'd; nothing could make
it rational, fo much as to wifh or expeft that they
did not all perifh there, except the Poflibility only
of their being taken up by another Ship in Com- ful
pany; and this was but, meer Poflibility indeed; nc
for I faw not the leaft Signal or Appearance of any J tfc
fiich Thing. " fo
I cannor explain, by any poffible Energy 6f Words,- . «f tj,
what a ftrange Longiftg or Hankering of Defires I j ^
felt in my Soul upon this Sight; breaking out fome-
times thus; O that there had been but one or two;
nayj/or but one Soul fav'd out of this Ship, to have
efcap'd to me, that I might but have had one
Companion, one Fellow-Creature to have fpoken
to me, and to have convers'd with ! In all the Time
ot" my folitary Life, I never felt fo earneft, fo
lirong a Defire after the Society of my Fellow-
Creatures, or fo deep a Regret at the Want of it. .
There are fome fecret moving Springs in the Af-
fection's, which when they are let a going by fome
Object in View, or be it fome Object, though not
in View, yet render'd prefent to the Mind by the
Power of Imagination, that Motion carries out the
Soul by its Impetuofity to fuch violent eager Em-
bracings of the Object, that the Abfence of it is
infupportable. ,
Such were thefe earneft Wifhings, That but on&
Man had been fav'd 1 O that it had been but One'. I,
believe I repeated the Words, 0 that it had been l>ui
One, a thoufand Times; and the Defires were fo
tnov'd by it, that when I fpoke the Words, my
Hands would clinch together, and my Fingers prefs
:he Palms of my Hands, that if I had had any fofc
Thing in my Hand, it would have crufh'd itinvo-
.untarily; and my Teeth in my He&d.would ftrike
together,
for fome time I could not part them again.
. Let the Naturalifts explain thefe Things, and
the Reafon and Manner of them ; all I can fay to
them, is, to defcribe the Fact, which was even
furprizing to me when I found it; though I knew
not from what it fhould proceed, it was doubtlefs
the Effect of ardent Wifhes, and of ftrong Ideas
form'd in my Mind, realizing the Comfort which
the Converfation of one of my Fellow-Chriilians
would have been to me.
But it was not to be ; either their Fate or mine,
or both, forbad it; for till the laft Year of my be-
ing on this Ifland, I never knew whether, any
were fav'd out of that Ship or no ; and had only
the Affliction fome Days after, to fee the Corps of
a drown'd Boy come on Shore, at the End of the
Ifland, which was next the Shipwreck : He had on
no Cloaths but a Seaman's Waftcoat, a Pair of
open-knee'd Linnen Drawers, and a blue Linnea
Shirt; but nothing to direct me fo much as to
guefs what Nation he was of. He had nothing in
his Pocket but two Pieces of Eight and a Tobac-
co-pipe ; the laft was to me of ten times more Va-
lue than the firft.
It was now calm, and I had a great Mind to
venture out in my Boat to this Wreck, not doubt-
ing but I might find fomething on Board that
might be ufeful to me; but that did not altogether
prefs me fo much, as the Poffibility that there
might be yet fome living Creature on Board, whofe
Lite I might not only fave, but might, by faving
that Life, comfort my own to the laft Degree ;
and this Thought clung fo to my Heart, that I
could not be quiet Night nor Day, but I rnufh
venture out in my Boat on Board this Wreck; and
committing the reft to God's Providence, I thought
the
it could not be refilled, that it muft come from
fome invifible Direction, and thatlfhould be want-
ing to my felf, if I did not go. ••
Under 'the Power of this Impreffion I haften'd
back to my Caftle, prepar'd every Thing for my
Voyage, took a Quantity of Bread, a great Pot for
frefh Water, a Compafs to fleer by, a Bottle of
Rum, for I had' flill a great deal of that left; a Baf"
ket full of Raifins. .And thus loading my felf with
every thing neceflary, I went down to my Boat,
got the Water out of her, and- got her afloat, load-
ed all my Cargo in her, "and then went Home aj
gain for more ;• my fecond Cargo was a great Bag
full of Rice, the Umbrella to fee up over my Head
for Shade, another large Pot full of frefh Water;
and about two Dozen of iny fmaU Loaves, or
Barley-Cakes, more< than before, with a Bottle of
Goat's-Milk and a Cheefe : All which, with great
Labour and Sweat, I brought to my'Boat; and
praying to God to direct my Voyage, I put out,
and rowing or paddlifig the Canoe along the Shore,
I came at lail to. the utmoft Point of the Ifland
on that Side (viz,.) .N...E..And now I was to launch
out into the Ocean, and either to venture, or not
to venture. I lookU on 'the rapid Currents which
ran conftantly on both Sides of the Ifland, a"t a
Diftance, and which were very terrible tome,
from the Remembrance of the Hazard I bad been
in before, and my Heart began to fail rrte; for I
forefaw that if I was driven into either of thcfe
Currents, I mould be carr/d a vaft Way out to
Ssa, and perhaps out of my Reach, or Sight of the
Ifland again ; and that then, as my Boat was but
fmall, if • any little Gale of Wind fliould rife, I
[faould be inevitably loft.
Thefe
Thefe Thoughts fo opprefs'd my Mind, that I
•began to give over my Enterprise, and having ha-
led my Boat into a little Creek on the Shore, I
ftept out, and fate me down upon a little rifing
bit of Ground, very penfive and anxious, between
Fear and Defire about my Voyage; when as I was
mufing, I could perceive that the Tide was turn'd,
and the Flood came on; upon which my going
was for fo many Hours impracticable : Upon this,
prefently it occur'd to me, that I fhould go up to
the higheft Piece of Ground I could find, and ob-
ferve, if I could, how the Sets of the Tide, or Cur-
rents lay, when the Flood eame in, that I might
judge whether if I was driven oneway out, I might
not expect to be driven another Way Home,
with the fame Rapidnefs of the Currents: This
Thought was no fooner in my Head, but I cafl my
Eye upon a little Hill, which Efficiently over-
look'd the Sea both Ways, and from whence I had
a clear View of the Currents, or Sets of the Tide,
and which Way I was to guide myfelf in my Re-
turn ; here I found, that as the Current of the Ebb
fet out clofe by the South Point of the Ifland, fo
the Current of the Flood fet in clofe by the Shore
of the North Side, and that I had nothing to do but
to keep to the North of the Ifland in my Return,
and I fhould do well enough.
Encourag'd with this Obfervation, I refolv'd the
next Morning to fet out with the firftof the Tide;
and repofing myfelf for the Night in the Canoe, un-
der the great Watch-coat I mentioned, I launch'd
out: I madefirfta little out to Sea full North, till I
began to feel the Benefit of the Current, which fet
Eaftward, and which carry'd me at a great Rate,
•and yet did not fo hurry me as the Southern Side
Current had done before, 'and fo as to take from,
m,e all Government of the Boat j but having a

good; but when I came to open the Chetts, I
found feveral Things of great Ufe to me: For
Example, I found in one a fine Cafe of Bottles, of
an extraordinary Kind, and fill'd with Cordial Wa-
ters, fine, and very good; the Bottles held about
three Pints each, and were tijp'd with Silver: I
found two Pots of very good Succades, or Sweet-
meats, fo faften'd alfo oh Top, that the Salt Water
had not hurt them; and two more of the fame,
which the Water had fpoil'd : I found fome very
good Shirts, which were very welcome to me, and
about a Dozen and half of Linnen white Handker-
chiefs, and colour'd Neckloths; the former were
alfo very welcome, being exceeding refrefhing to
wipe my Face in a hot Day ; befides this, when I
came to the Till in the Chefts, I found there three
great Bags of Pieces of Eight, which held out about
eleven hundred Pieces in all; and in one of them,
wrapt up in a Paper, fix Doubloons of Gold, and
fome fmall Bars or Wedges of Gold ; I fuppofe they
might all weigh near a Pound.
The other Cheft I found had fome Cloaths in if,
but of little Value ; but .by the Circumftances it
mift have belong'd to the Gunner's Mate, though
:here was no Powder in it, but about two Pound ot
ine glaz'd Powder, in three fmall Flasks, kept, I
uppofe, for charging their Fowling Pieces on Oc-
:afion : Upon the Whole, I got very little by this
/oyage, that was of any Ufe to me; for as to the
kloney, I had no Manner of Occafion for it; 'twas
o me as the Dirt under my Feet; and I would
ave given it all for three or four Pair of EiftfiP
hoes and Stockings, which were Things I greatly
ranted, but had not had on my Feet now tor
uny YearS: I had, indeed, gotten two Pair or
lioes now; which I took off of the Feet or the
two
I found two Pair more in one of the Chefts, which
were very welcome to me; but they were not like
our English Shoes, either for Eafe or Service, being
rather what we call Pumps than Shoes: I found
in this Seaman's Cheft about fifty Pieces of Eight
in Royals, but no Gold ; I fuppofe this belong'd
to a poorer Man than the other, which feem'd to
belong to fome Officer.
• Well, however, I lug'd this Money home to
jriy Cave, and laid it up, as I had done that before,
which I brought from our own Ship j but it was
great Pity, as I faid, that the other Part of this
Ship had not come to my Share, for I an; fatisfy'd
I might have loaded my Canoe feveral Times over
with Money, which, if I had ever efcap'd to Eng-
land, would have lain here" fafe enough till I might
have come again and fetch'd it.
Having now brought all my Things on Shore,,
and fecur'd them, I went back to my Boat, and
row'd or paddled her along the Shore to her old
Harbour, where I laid her up, and made the beft
of my way to my old Habitation, where I found
every Thing fafe and quiet ; fo I began to repofe
my felf, live after my old Fafhion, and take
Care of my Family - Aftairs ; and for a while, I
lived eafy enough, only that I was more vigilant
than I ufed to be, look'd out ofcner, and did not
go abroad fo much; and if at any time I did ftir
with any Freedom, it was always to the Eaft
Part of the Jlland, where I was pretty well fatif-
fy'd the Savages never came, and where I could
go without fo many Precautions, and fuch a Load
of Arms and Ammunition, as I always carry'd with
me, if I went the other Way.
I liv'd in this Condition near two Years more ;
but my unlucky Head, that was always to let me
" know
vas all the two Years fill'd with Pro/efts and Do<
Defigns, how, if it were poffible, I might get away then
rom this Ifland ; for fometimes I was for making the
.nother Voyage to the Wreck, though my Rea- favit
on told me that there was nothing left there worth B
he Hazard of my Voyage: Sometimes for a fo I
Gamble one Way, fometimes another; and I be* the
ieve verily, if I had had the Boat that I went from Ext
SaHee in, I fliould have ventur'd to Sea, bound any and
vhere I knew not whither. I W
I have been, in all my Circumftances, a Memento Statj
:o thofe who are touch'd with the general Plague Mea
af Mankind, whence, for ought I know, one Half and
af their Miferies flow; I mean, that of not'being Rea
[atisfy'd with the Station wherein God and Na- tt n
cure hath plac'd them; for not to look back upon njy
my primitive Condition, and the excellent Advice Sch
pf my father, the Qppofition to which, was? *ou
as I may caS it, my ORIGINAL SIN, my fubfequent I
Miftakes of the fame Kind had been the Means of atei
my coming into this miferable Condition; for had laid
that Providence, which fo happily had feared me Con
at the Srafils, as 3 Planter, blefs'd me with con- mot
fin'd Defires, and I could have been contented to not
have gone on gradually, I might have been by this tlia
Time, / mec\n in the "Timt of my being in this tymh ^
pne of the mofl confiderable Planters in the Bra- I
fils; nay, I am perfwaded, that by the Improve- Ma
pients I had made in that little Time I liv'd there, Kit
^nd the Encreafe I fhould probably have made, it I l)'i
jhad ftay'd, I might have been worth an hundred
thoufand Moyadorps; and what Bufine/s had I £0
|eaye a fettled Fortune, a well-itock'd Plantation,
improving and encreafing, to turn Sufra Cargo to Wi
guinea, tp fetch Negroes, when Patience a"4 ' vw
" fo encreas'd pur Stock at
Door, from thofe whofe Bufinefs it was to fetch
them? and tho' it had coft us fomething more, yet
the Difference of that Price was by no means worth
faving at fo great a Hazard.
But as this is ordinarily the Fate of young Heads,
fo Reflection upon the Folly of it, is as ordinarily
the Exercife of more Years, or of the dear-bought
Experience of Time ; and fo it was with me now ;,
and yet fo deep had the Miftake taken root in
my Temper that I could not fatisfy myfelf in my
Station, but was continually poring upon the.
Means and Poffibility of my Efcape from this Place ;
and that I may with the greater Pleafure to the
Reader bring on the remaining Part of my Story,
it may not be improper to give fome Account of
my firft Conceptions on the Subject of this foolifh
Scheme for my Efcape ; and how, and upon what
Foundation I acted.
I am now to be fuppos'd retired into my Cattle,
after my late Voyage to the Wreck, my Frigate
laid up, and fecur'd under Water, as ufual, and my
Condition reftored to what it was before : I had
more Wealth indeed, than I had before, but was
not at all the richer ; for I had no more Ufe for it,
than the Indians of Peru had before the Spaniards
came there.
It was one of the Nights, in the rainy Seafon in
March, the four and twentieth Year of my firft
ietting Foot in this Ifland of Solitarinefs, I was
lying in my Bed, or Hammock, awake, very well
in Health, had no Pain, no Diflemper, no Unea-
finefs of Body, no, nor any Uneafinefs of Mind,
more than ordinary, but could by no Means
clofe my Eyes ; that is, fo as to fleep ; no, not 3
Night long, otherwife than as follows ;

It is as impoffible as necdlefs, to fet down the
innumerable Crowd of Thoughts that whirl'd
through that great Thorowfair of the Brain, the
Memory, in this Night's Time: I run over the
whole Hiftory of my Life in Miniature, or by
Abridgment, as I may call it, to my coming to this
Ifland; andalfo of the Part of my Life fince I
came to this Ifland. In my Reflections upon the
State of my Cafe, fince I came on Shore on this
Ifland, I was comparing the happy Pofture of my
Affairs in the firft Years of my Habitation here,
compar'd to the Life of Anxiety, Fear, and Care,
which I had liv'din ever fince I had feen the Print of
a Foot in the Sand; not that I did not believe the
Savages had frequented the I/landeven all the while,
and might have been feveral Hundreds of them it
times on Shore there; but I had never known it,
and was incapable of any Apprehenfions about it;
my Satisfaction was perfect, tho' my Danger was
the fame ; and I was as happy in not knowing my
Danger, as if I had never really been expos'd to it.
This furnifh'd my Thoughts with many very pro-
fitable Reflections, and particularly this one, How
infinitely good that Providence is, which has pro-
vided in its Government of Mankind fuch narrow
Bounds to his Sight and Knowledge of Things;
and tho' he walks in the Mid/t pf fo many thou-
fand Dangers, the Sight of which, if difcover'd to
him, would diftract his Mind, and fink his Spirits,
he is kept ferene and calm, by having the Events
of Things hid from his Eyes, and knowing no-
thing of the Dangers which furround him.
After thefe Thoughts had for fome Time enter-
tain'd me, I came to refled ferioufly upon the real
Danger I had been in for fo many Years in this
very Ifland-t and how I had walk'd about in the
greatefl Security, and with all poffible Tranquili-
ty ; even when perhaps nothing but a Brow of a
Hill, a great Tree, or the cafual Approach of •
Night, had been between me and the worft Kind
of Deftrudtion, viz,. That of falling into the Hands
of Canibals and Savages, who would have feis'd
on me with the fame View as I did of a Goat or
a Turtle, and have thought it no more a Crime to
kill and devour me, than I did of a Pidgeon or a
Curlieu : I fhould unjuflly flander myfelf, if I
fhould fay I was not fincerely thankful to my
great Preferver, to whofe fingular Protection I ac-
knowledg'd with great Humility, that all thefe
unknovrn Deliverances were due ; and without
which I muft inevitably have fallen into their mer-
jcilefs Hands.
When thefe Thoughts were over, my Head was
for fome time taken up in confidering the Nature
of thefe wretched Creatures, I mean the Savages ;
and how it came to pafs in the World, that the
wife Governour of all Things fhould give up any
of his Creatures to fuch Inhumanity; nay, to
fomething fo much below even Brutality itfelf, as
to devour its own Kind; but as this ended in fome
(at that time fruitlefs) Speculations, it occur'd
to me to encjuire, what Part of the World thefe
Wretches liv'd in ; how far oft' the Coaft was from
whence they came; what they ventur'd over fo far
from Home for; what Kind of Boats they had ;
and why I might not order myfelf, and my Buli-
nefs fo, that I might be as able to go over thither,
as they were to come to me.
I never fo much as troubled myfelf to confider
what I fhould do with myfelf when I came thi-
ther ; what would become of me, if I fell into the
Hands of the Savages; or how I mould efcape from
them, if they attempted me; no, nor fo much as
how it was poffible for me to reach the Coaft, and
not
out any Poflibility of delivering myfelf; and if I
fhould not tall into their Hands, what I fhould do
for Provifion, or whither I fhould bend my Courfe;
none of thefe Thoughts, I fay, fo much as came
in my Way ; but my Mind was wholly bent upon
the Notion of my pafling over in my Boat to the
main Land : I look'd back upon my prefent Con-
dition, as the moft miferable that could poflibly be,
that I was not able to throw myfelf into any thing
but Death, that could be call'd worfe; that if I
reach'd the Shore of the Main, I might perhaps
meet with Relief, or I might coaft along as I did
on the Shore of Africk, rill I came to fome in-
habited Country, and where I might find fome Re-
lief ; and after all, perhaps I might fall in with
fome Chriftian Ship that might take me in; and
if the worft came to the worft, I could but die,
which would put an end to all thefe Miseries at
once. Pray note, all this was the Fruit of a dif-
turb'd Mind, an impatient Temper, made as it
were defperate, by the long Continuance of my
Troubles, and the Difappointments I had met in
the Wreck I had been on Board of, and where I
had been fo near the obtaining what I fo earneftly
long'd for, viz.. fome Body to fpeak to, and to learn
fome Knowledge from of the Place where I was,
and of the probable Means of my Deliverance:
1 fay, I was agitated wholly by thefe Thoughts.
All my Calm of Mind in my Refignation to Pro-
vidence, and waiting the Iflbe of the Difpofitions
of Heaven, feem'd to be fufpended; and I had, as
it were, no Power to turn my Thoughts' to any
Thing, but to the Project of a Voyage to the
Main, which came upon me with fuch Force, and
fuch an Impetuofity of Defire, that it was not to
be refilled, .. " „
When
When this had agitated my Thoughts for two
Hours or more with fuch Violence, that it fee
my very Blood into a Ferment, and my Pulfe beat
as high as if I had been in a Fever, merely with
the extraordinary Fervour of my Mind about it,
Nature, as if I had been fatigued and exhaufted
with the very Thought of it, threw me into a
found Sleep: One would have thought I fhould
have dream'd of it ; but I did not, nor of any
Thing relating to it; but I dream'd, that as I wasr
going out in the Morning, as ufual, from my Caftle,
J faw upon the Shore two Canoes, and eleven Sava-
ges coming to Land, and that they brought with
them another Savage, who they were going to kill,
in order to eat him; when on a fudden, the Sa-
vage that they were going to kill, jump'daway
and ran for his Life ; and I thought in my Sleep,
that he came running into my little thick Grove
before my Fortification to hide himfelf; and that
I feeing him alone, and not perceiving that the o-
ther fought him that way, fhew'd myfelf to him,
and, fmilingupon him, encourag'd him; that he
kneel'd down to me, feeming to pray me to affift
him; upon which I fhew'd my Ladder, made him
go up, and carry'd him into my Cave, and he be-
came my Servant ; and that as foon as I had got-
ten this Man, I faid to myfelf, now I may cer-
tainly venture to the Main Land ; for this Fellow
will ferve me as a Pilot, and will tell me what to
do, and whither to go for Provifions; and whi-
ther not to go for fear of being devour'd, what Pla-
ces to venture into, and what to efcape : I wak'd
with this Thought, and was under fuch inexpref-
fible Impreffionsof Joy at the Profpect of my Efcape
in my Dream, that the Difappointments which I felt
upon coming to myfelf, and finding it was no
fmore than a Dream, were equally extravagant the
tion of Spirit.
Upon this, however, I made this Conclufion,
That my only Way to go about an Attempt for an
Efcape, was, if poflible, to get a Savage into my
Pofleffion; and, if poflible, it mould be one of their
Prifoners, who they had condemn'd to be eaten,
and mould bring thither to kill; but thefe
Thoughts {till were attended with this Difficulty,
that it was impoflible to effect this, without at-
tacking a whole Caravan of them, and killing them
all; and this was not only a very defperate At-
tempt, and might mifcarry ; but, on the other
hand, I had greatly fcrupled the Lawfulnefs of it to
me, and my Heart trembled at the Thoughts of
ihedding fo much Blood, tho' it was for my Deli-
verance. I need not repeat the Arguments which
occur'd to me againft this, they being the fame
mention'd before : But tho' I had other Reafons to
offer now, (viz,.) that thofe Men were Enemies to
my Life, and would devour me, if they could;
that it was Self-prefervation in the higheft Degree,
to deliver myfelf from this Death of a Life, and
was acting in my own Defence, as much as if they
were actually aflaulting me, and the like. I fay,
tho' thefe Things argued for it, yet the Thoughts
of fhedding humane Blood for my Deliverance,
were very terrible to me, and fuch as I could
by no Means reconcile my felf to a great
while.
However, at laft, after many fecret Difputes
with myfelf, and after great Perplexities about
it j for all thefe Arguments, one way and another,
ftruggled in my Head a long Time ; the eager
prevailing Defire of Deliverance at length mafter'd
all the reft; and I refolv'd, if poflible, to get one
of thofe Savages .into my Hands, coft what if
would,
to do it, and this indeed was very difficult to re-
folve on: But as I could pitch upon no probable
Means for it, fo I refolv'd to put myfelf upon the
Watch, to fee them when they came on Shore,
and leave the reft to the Event, taking fuch Mea-
fures as the Opportunity fhould prefent, let be what
would be.
* With thefe Refolutions in my Thoughts, I fet
myfelf upon the Scout, as often as poffible, and
indeed fo often, till I was heartily tir'd of it; for
it was above a Year and half that I waited, and
for great part of that Time went out to the Weft
End, and to the South Weft Corner of the IQand,
almoft every Day, to fee for Canoes, but none
appear'd. This was very difcouraging, and began
to trouble me much; tho' I cannot fay that it did
in this Cafe, as it had done fome Time before that,
(viz,.) wear off the Edge of my Defire to the Thing.
But the longer it feem'd to be delay'd, the more
eager I was for it; in a Word, I was not at firft fo
careful to fbun the Sight of thefe Savages, and
avoid being feen by them, as I was now eager to
be upon them.
Befides, I fancy'd myfelf able to manage one,
nay, two or three Savages, if I had them, fo as to
make them entirely Slaves to me, to do what-
ever I fhould direct them, and to prevent their
being able at any Time to do me any Hurt. It
was a great while, that I pleas'd myfelf with this
Affair, but nothing ftiil prefented ; all my Fancies
and Schemes came to nothing, fot no Savages came
near me for a great while.
About a Year and half after I had entertain'd
thefe Notions, and, by long mufing, had as it were
refolv'd them all into nothing, for want of an Oc-
cafion to put them in Execution, I was furpriz'd
one
Canoes all on Shore together on my fide the Ifland;
and the People who belong'd to them all landed,
and out of my Sight: The Number of them broke
all my Meafures ; for feeing fo many, and know-
ing that they always came four or fix, or fometimes
more, in a Boat, I could not tell what to think of
it, or how to take my Meafures, to attack twen-
ty or thirty Men fingle handed; fo I lay ftill in
my Caftle, perplexed and difcomforted: However,
1 put myfelf into all the fame Poftures for an At-
tack, that I had formerly provided, and was juii
ready for Action, if any thing had prefented. Ha-
ving waited a good while, liftening to hear if they
made any Noife; at length, being very impatient,
I fet my Guns at the Foot of my Ladder, and
clamber'd up to the Top of the Hill, by my two
Stages as ufual; ftanding fo, however, that my
Head did not appear above the Hill, fo that
they could not perceive me by any means : Here
I obferv'd, by the Help of my Perfpective Gla&,
that they were no lefs than thirty in Number, that
they had a Fire kindled, that they had had Meat
drefs'd ; how they had cook'd it, that I knew not,
or what it was; but they were all dancing in I
know not how many barbarous Geflures and Fi-
gures their own Way, round the Fire.
While. I was thus looking on them, I perceiv'd,
by my Perfpedive, two miferable Wretches drag'd
from the Boats, where it feems they were laid by,
ind were now brought out for the Slaughter. I
perceiv'd one of them immediately fell, being
inock'd down, I fuppofe with a Club or Wooden
Jword, for that was their Way, and two or three
>thers were at Work immediately cutting him open
or their Cookery, while the other Victim was left
landing by himfelf, till they ftould be ready foe
.him,
ing himfelf a little at Liberty, Nature infpir'd him
with Hopes of Life, and he ftarted away from
them, and ran with incredible Swiftnefs along the
Sands diredly towards me, I mean, towards that
part of the Coaft where my Habitation was.
I was dreadfully frighted, (that I muft acknow-
ledge) when I perceiv'd him to run my Way; and
efpecially, when as I thought I faw him purfued
by the whole Body; and now I expected that Part
of my Dream was coming to pafs, and that he
would certainly take Shelter in my Grove; but I
could. not depend by any Means upon my Dream
for the reft of it, (viz,.) that the other Savages
would not purfue him thither, and find him there.
However I kept my_ Station, and my Spirits began
to recover, when I found that there was not above
three Men that follow'd him; and ftill more was I
encourag'd, when I found that he outftript them
exceedingly in Running, and gain'd Ground of
them, fo that if he could but hold it for half an
Hour, J faw eafily he would fairly get away from
them all.
There was between them and my Caftle the
Creek which I mentioned often at the firft Part of
my Story, when I landed my Cargoes out of the
Ship ; and. this, I faw plainly, he muft neceflarily
fwim over, or the poor Wretch would be taken
there: But when the Savage efcaping came thi-
ther, he made nothing of it, tho* the Tide was
then up, but ph.nging in, fwam thro' in thir-
ty Strokes or thereabouts, landed, and ran on
with exceeding Strength and Swiftnefs ; when the
three Perfons came to the Creek, I found that two
of them could fwim, but the third could not,
and that ftanding on the other Side, he look'd at
the other, but went no farther; and fqon after went
r. . fofcly
foftly back again, which, as it happen'd, was v?
• ry well for him in the main.
I obferv'd, that the two who fwam, were yet
more than twice as long fwimming over the Creek,
as the Fellow was that fled from them : It came
now very warmly upon my Thoughts, and indeed
irrefiftibly, that now was my Time to get me 2
Servant, and perhaps a Companion or Afliftant;
and that I was call'd plainly by Providence to fave
this poor Creature's Life; I immediately run down
the Ladders with all poflible Expedition, fetch'd
my two Guns, for they were both but at the Foot
or" the Ladders, as I obferv'd above; and getting
.up again with the fame Hafte to the Top of the
Hill, I crofs'd toward the Sea; and having a very
fhort Cut, and all "down Hill, clap'd myfelf in
the way between the Purfuers and the Purfued;
hollowing aloud to him that fled, who looking
back, was at firft perhaps as much frighted at me
as at them; but 1 beckon'd with my Hand to him
to come back, and in the mean time I flowly ad-
vanc'd towards the two thatfollow'd; then rutting
at once upon the foremoft, I knock'd him down with
the Stock of my Piece: I was loth to fire, becauie
I would not have the reft hear; though at that
Piftance it would not have been eafily heard;
and being out of Sight of the Smoak too, they
would not have eafily known what to make of it:
Having knock'd :his Fellow down, the other, who
purfu'd him ftop'd, as if he had been frig^
.ed; and I advanc'd apace towards him; but as 1
came nearer, I perceiv'd prefcntly he had a Bow
and Arrow, and was fitting it to fhoot at me; io 1
was then neceflitated to fhoot at him firft, which 1
did, and fcill'd him at the firft Shoot; the poor Savage
who fled, but had ftop'd, though he fa\v both
his Enemies fallen, and kill'd, as he thought; yet
vvas
Piece, that he ftood ftock-flill, and neither came
forward or 'went backward, tho' the feem'd rather
inclin'd to. fly ftill, than to "come on ; I hollow'd
" again to him, and made Signs to come forward,
which he eafily underftood, and came a little Way,
then ftopp'd again ; and then. a little farther, and
ftopp'd again; and I could then perceive that he
flood trembling, as if he had been taken Prifoner,
and had juft been to be kill'd, as his two Enemies
were: I beckon'd him again to come to me, and
gave him all the Signs of Encouragement that I
could think of, and he came nearer and nearer,
kneeling down every ten or twelve Steps, in Token
" of Acknowledgment for my faving his Life: I fmil'd
at him, and look'd pleafantly, and beckon'd to him
to come ftill hearer; at length he came clofe to me,
and then he krieel'd down again, kifs'd the Ground,
'and laid 'his Head upon the Ground, and takirig
me by the. Foot, fet my Foot upon his Head ;
this, it feems, was in Token of fwearing to be my
Slave for ever. I took him up, and made much of
him, arid encourag'd him all I could: But 'there
was more Work to do yet, for I perceiv'd the Sa-
vage, whom I knock'd down, was not kill'd, but
ftumVd with the Blow, and began to come tohim-
felf j fo I "pointed to him, and i ho wing him the Sa-
vage, that he was not dead; upon this he fpoke
fome Words to me, and tho' I 'could not underftand
them, yet I thought they were pleafant to hear, for
they were the firft Sound of a Man's Voice that I
had heard, my own excepted, for above twenty five
Years. But there was no Time for fuch Reflecti-
ons now; the Savage, who was knock'd down,
recover'd himfelf fo far, as to fit up upon the
Ground, and I perceiv'd that my Savage began to
be afraid ; but when I faw that I presented my o-
R ther
upon this my Savage, for fo I call him now, made
a Motion to me to lend him my Sword, which hung
naked in a Belt by my Side; ib I did: He no foon.
er had it, but he runs to his Enemy, and at one
Blow cut off his Head as cleverly, no Executioner
in Germany could have done it fooner or better;
which I thought very ftrange, for one, who I had
Reafon to believe never law a Sword in his Life be-
fore, except their own wooden Swords; however,
it feems, as I learn'd afterwards, they make their
wooden* Swords fb fharp, fo heavy, and the Wood
is fo hard, that they will cut off Heads even with
them, aye and Arms, and that at one Blow too:
When he had done this, he comes laughing to me
in Sign of Triumph, and brought me the Sword
again, and with abundance of Geflures, whfchl
did not underftand, laid it down with the Head of
the Savage that he hadkill'd, juft before me.
But that which aftonifh'd him moft, was to
know how I had kill'd the other Indian fo far off;
fo, pointing to him, he made Signs to me to let
him go to him j fo I bad him go, as well as I could;
when he came to him, he flood like one amaz'd,
looking at him, turn'd him firft on one Side, then
on t'other, look'd at the Wound the Bullet had
made, which, it feems, was juft in his Breaft, where
it had made a Hole, and no great Quantity of
Blood had follow'd, but he had bled inwardly, for
he was quite dead : He took up his Bow and Ar-
rows, and came back, fo I turn'd to go away, and
beckon'd to him to follow me, making Signs to
him, that more might come after them.
Upon this he fign'd to me, that he fhould bury
them with Sand/tbat they might not befeenby
the reft if they follow'd; and fo I made Signs again
:o him to do fo; he fell to work, and in an Inftant
he
he had fcrap'd a Hole in the Sand with his Hands,
big enough to bury the firft in, and then dragg'd
him into it, and cover'd him, and did fo alfo by
the other; I believe he had bury d them both in a
Quarter of an Hour; then calling him away, I car-
ry'd him not to my Caftle, but quite away to my
Cave, on the farther Part of the Ifland; fo I did
not let my Dream come to pafs in that Part, viz.
That he came into my Grove for Shelter.
Here I gave him Bread, and a Bunch of Raifins
to eat, and a Draught of Water, which I found he
was indeed in great Diftrefs for, by his Running ^
and having refrem'd him, I made Signs for him to
go lie down and fleep, pointing to a Place where
I had laid a great Parcel of Rice Straw, and a
Blanket upon it, which I ufed to fleep upon my
(elf fometimes; fb the poor Creature laid down,
and went to fleep.
He was a comely handfome Fellow, perfectly well
made, with ftrait ftrong Limbs, not too large, tall
and well fhap'd, and, as I reckon, about twenty fix
Years of Age. He had a very good Countenance,
not a fierce and furly Afpedt, but feem'd to have
fbmething very Manly in his Face, and yet he had
all the Sweetnefs and Softnefs of an European in his
Countenance too, efpecially when he fmird. His
Hair was long and black, not curl'd like Wool ^ his
Forehead very high, and large, and a great Vivacity
and fparkling Sharpnefs in his Eyes. The Colour of
his Skin was not quite black, but very tawny, and
yet not of an ugly yellow naufeous Tawny, as the
Brafilians, and Virgiuians^ and other Natives of A-
merica are, but of a bright Kind of a dun Olive Co-
lour, that had in it fomething very agreeable, tho*
not very eafy to defcribe. His Face was round
and plump, his Nofe fmall, not flat like the Ne-
groes, a very good Mouth, thin Lips, and his
R 2 fine
had flumber'd, rather than ikpt, about hall" an
Hour, he wak'd again, and comes out of the Cave
to me; for I had been milking my Goats which I
had in the Enclofure juft by : When he efpy'd me,
he came running to me, laying hiuilelf down a.
gain upon the Ground, with all the polfible Signs
of an humble thankful Difpofition, making a
many antick Geftures to ihow it: At laft he lays
his Head flat upon the Ground, dole to my Poor,
and fets my other Foot upon his Head, as he had
done before ; and after this, made all the Signs to
me of Subjection, Servitude, and SubmifTion ima-
ginable, to let me know how he wculd fervemeas
long as he liv'd. I underftcod him in many Things,
and let him know I was very well pleas'd with
hinij in a little Time I began to fpeak to him,
and teach him to fpeak to me ^ and firft, I made
him know his Name Ihould be Fiiday, which was
the Day I fav'd his Life;' T call'd him fo for the
Memory of the Time ^ I likewife taught him to
fay Mafter, and then let him know that was to
be my Name ; I likewife taught him to fay Ta
md ATo, and to know the Meaning of them j I
*ave him fome Milk, in an earthen Pot, and 'let
aim.fee me drink it before him, and fop my
Bread, in it ^ and I gave him a Cake of Bread, to
lo the like, which he quickly comply'd with, and
nade Signs that it was very good for him-
I kept there with him all that Night, but as
bon as it was Day, Ibtckon'ci to him to come with
ne, and let him know I would give him fome
"loaths, at which he feem'd very glad, for he was
tark-naked : As we went by the Place "where he
ladbury'd the two Men,,he pointed exactly to
he Place, and fliew'd me the Marks that he hM
lade to find them again, making Signs to me
that
that we mould dig them up again, and eat them j
at this I appear'd very angry, exprefs'd my Ab-
horrence of it, made as if I would vomit at the
Thoughts of it, and beckonYl with my Hand to
him to come away, which he did immediately,
with great Submiilion. i then led him up to thtf
Top of the Hill, to fee if his Enemies were gone'j
and pulling out my Glafs, I look'd and faw plain-
ly the Place where they had been, but no Appear-
ance of them, or of their Canoes ^ fo that it was
plain that they were gone, and had left their
two Comrades behind them, without any Search
after them.
But I was not content with this Difcovery, but
having now more Courage, and confequently more
Curiofity, I takes my Man Fiiday with me, giving
him the Sword in his Hand, with the Bow and
Arrows at his Back, which I found he could ufe
very dextroufly, making him carry one Gun for me,
and I two for myfelf, and away we march'd to the
Place, where thefe Creatures had been ; for I had
a Mind now to get fome fuller Intelligence of
them: When 1 came to the Place, my very Blood
ran chill in myrYeins, and my Heart funk within
me at the Horror. of the Spectacle: Indeed it was a
dreadful Sight, at leaft it wasfo tome, tho' Friday
made nothing of it: The Place was cover'd with^
human Bones, the Ground dy'd with their Blood,
great Pieces of Flelh left here and there, half
eaten, mangled and fcorch'd; and, in mort, all the
Tokens of the triumphant Feaft they had been
making there, after a Victory over their Enemies:
I faw three Skulls, five Hands,and the Bonesof three
or four Legs and Feet, and abundance of other Parts
of the Bodies; andFizVaj by his Signs, made me
underftand, that they brought over four Prifoners
to feaft upon, that three of them were eaten up,
R 3 and
That there had been a great "Battle between them,
and their next King, whofe Subjects, it feems, he had
been one of; and that they had taken a great Num-
ber of Prifbners, all which were carry'd to feveral
Places by thofe that had taken them in the Fight,
in order to feaft upon them, as was June here by
thefe Wretches upon thofe they brought hither.
I caus'd Friday to gather all the Skulls, Bones,
Flefli, and whatever remain'd, and lay them toge-
ther on a Heap, and make a great Fire upon it,
and burn them all to Allies: I found .Fn'ifojfhadftill
a hankering Stomach after fome of the Fiefh, and
was ftill a Cannibal in his Nature ; but I difco
ver'd fo mudi Abhorrence at the very Thoughts of
it, and at the leaft Appearance of it, that he durft
not difcover it ^ for I had, by fome Means, let him
know, that I would kill him if he offer'd it.
When we had done this, we came back to our
Caftle, and there I fell to work for my Man Friday;
and firft of all I gave him a Pair of Liuen Draw-
ers which I had out of the poor Gunner's Cheft I
mention'd, and which I found in the Wreck, and
which, with a little Alteration,fitted him very well;
then I made him a Jerkin of Goat's-fkin, as well as
my Skill would allow ^ and I was now grown a
tolerable good Taylor ; and I gave him a Cap,
which I had made of a Hare-fkin, very convenient,
and falhionable enough; and thus he was cloath d
for the prefent, tolerably well, and was mighty
well pleas'd to fee himfelf almoft as well cloath d
as his Mailer: It is true, he went awkardly in
thefe Things at firft : Wearing the Drawers was
very awkard to him, and the Sleeves of the Waft-
coat gall'd his Shoulders, and the Infide of his
Arms -, but a little eafing them, where he complain d
they hurt him, and ufing himfelf to them, at
length he took to them very well.
The next Day, after I came Home to my Hutch
with him, I began to confider where I fhould lodge
him ; and that I might do well for him, and yet be
perfectly eafy myfelf, I made a little Tent for him
in the vacant Place between my two Fortifications,
in the Infide of the laft, and in the Outfideof the
firft: And as there was a Door or Entrance there
into my Cave, I made a formal fram'd Door.cafe,
and a Door to it of Boards, and fet it up in the
PafTage, a little within the Entrance ^ and caufing
the Door to open on the Infide, I barr'd it up in
the Night, taking in my Ladders too -y fo that Fri-
day could no Way come at me in the Infide of my
innermoft Wall, without making fo much Noife in
getting over, that it muft needs waken me; for my
firft Wall had now a compleat Roof over it of long
Poles, covering all my Tent, and leaning up to the
Side of the Hill, which was again laid crofs with
fmaller Sticks inftead of Laths, and then thatch'd
over a great Thicknefs with the Rice Straw, which
was ftrong like Reeds j and at the Hole or Place
which was left to go in or out by the Ladder, I had
plac'd a kind of Trap-door, which if it had been
attempted on the Outfide, would not have open'd
at all, but would have fallen down, and made a
great Noife ; and as to Weapons, I took them all
in to my Side every Night.
But I needed none of all this Precaution ; for ne-
ver Man had a more faithful, loving, fincere Ser-
vant than Friday was to me ; without Pafllons,
Sullennefs, or Defigns, perfectly oblig'd and en-
gag'd ; his very Affections were ty'd to me, like
thofe of a Child to a Father ; and I dare fay, he
would have facrific'd his Life for the faving mine,,
upon any Occafion whatfbever j the many Teftinio.
R 4
nies he gave me of this, put it out of Doubt, and
foon convince! me, that I needed to ufe no Precau-
tions as to my Safety on his Account.
This frequently gave me Occafion to obferve,
and that with wonder, that however it had pleas'd
God in his Providence, and in the Government of
the Works of his Hands, to take from fo great a
Part of the World of his Creatures, thebeft Ufes to
which their Faculties and the Powers of their
Souls are adapted; yet that he has beftow'd upon
them the fame Powers, the fame Reafon, the fame
Affedions, the fame Sentiments of Kindnefs and
Obligation, the fame Paflions and Refentments
of Wrongs, the fame Senfe of Gratitude, Sinceri-
ty, Fidelity, and all the Capacities of doing Good,
and receiving Good, that he has given to us ; and
that when he pleafes to offer to them Occafionsof
exerting thefe, they are as ready, nay, more ready
to apply them to the right Ufes for which they
were beftow'd, than we are. And this made me
very melancholy fometimes, in reflecting, as the
feveral Occasions prefented, how mean a Ufe we
make of ail thefe, even though we have thefe Po-
wers enlighten'd by the great Lamp of Inftrudtion,
the Spirit of God, and by the Knowledge of his
Word added to our Underftanding; and why i£
has pleas'd God to hide the like faving Knowledge
from fo many Millions of Souls, who (if I might
judge by this poor Savage) would make a CHKS
better Ufe of it than we did.
From hence I fometimes was led' too far to
invade the Sovereignty of Providence, and, as it
were,arraignthe Juftice of fo arbitrary a Difpoiition
of Things, that mould hide that Light from feme,
and reveal it to others, and yet expect a like Du-
ty from both : But I fhut it up, and check'd my
Thoughts with this Conclufion, i ft, That we did
'.'". ...,;.,. , -'•...•.•'. ' • •• not
not know by what Light and Law thefe fhould be
condemn'd ; but that as God was neceflarily, and,.'
by the Nature of his Being, infinitely holy and
juft, fo it could not be, but that if thefe Crea-
tures were all fentfenc'd to Abfence from himfelf,
it was on Account of finning againft that Light,
which, as the Scripture fays, was a Law to them-
felves, and by fuch Rules as^their Confciences would
acknowledge to be juft, tho'the Foundation was not
difcover'd to us. And, 2dly, That ftill as we are all
the Clay in the Hand of the Potter, no VeljCelr
could fay to him, Why haft thou form'd me thus? •(
But to return to my new Companion : I was
greatly delighted with him, and made it my Bun"-.
nefs to teach him every Thing that was proper to
make him ufeful, handy, and helpful; but efpeci-
ally to make him fpeak, and tmderftand me when
I fpake j and he was the apteft Scholar that ever
was, and particularly was fo merry, fo conftant^y
diligent, and fo pleas'd, when he could but un-
derftand me or make me underftand him, that it
was very pleafant to me to talk to him .., and now
my Life began to be foeafy, that I began to fay to
myfelf, that could I but have been fare irom more
Savages, I cared not if I was never to remove from
the Place while I liv'd.
After I had been two or three Days return'd to
my Caftle, I thought that, in order to bring Friday
off from his horrid Way of Feeding, and from the
Relifli of a CanibaFs Stomach*, I ought to let him
tafte other Flefli j fo I took him out with me one
Morning to the Woods; I went, indeed, intending
to kill a Kid out of my own Flock, and bring him
home and drefs it: But as I was going, I faw
a She Goat lying down in the Shade, and two
young Kids fitting bv her ; I catch'd hold of Fri*
, hold,fays I, ftanclftill; and made Signs to him
and kill'd one of the Kids. The poor Creature,
who had at a Diftance, indeed, feen me kill the
Savage, his Enemy, but did not know, or could
imagine, how it was done, was fenfibly furpriz'd,
trembled, and Ihook, and look'd fo amaz d, that
I thought he would have funk down. He did not
fee the Kid I had mot at, or perceive I had kilPd
it, but ripp'd up his Waftecoat to feel if he was
not wounded, and, as I found, prefently thought
I was refblv'd to kill him ; for he came and
kneel'd down to me, and embracing my knees,
faid a great many Things I did not underftand,
but I could eafily fee that the Meaning was to
pray me not to kill him.
I foon found a Way to convince him that I would
do him no Harm, and taking him up by the Hand,
laugh'd at him, and pointing to the Kid which I
had kiird, beckon'd to him to run and fetch it,
which he did ; and while he was wondering and
looking to fee how the Creature was kill'd, I load-
ed my Gun again, and by-and-by I faw a great
Fowl like a Hawk fit upon a Tree within Shot ;
fo, to let Friday underftand a little what I would do,
[ call'd him to me again, pointing at the Fowl,which
was indeed a Parrot, tho' I thought it had been a
Hawk $ I fay, pointing to the Parrot, and to myG»n,
and to the Ground under the Parrot, to let him fee
I would make it fall, I made him underftand that
I would {hoot and kill that Bird ; accordingly I
nYd, and bad him look, and immediately he faw
the Parrot fall ; he ftood like one frighted again,
notwithftanding all I had faid to him ^ and I found
he was the more amaz'd, becaufe he did not fee
me put anything into the Gun; but thought that
there muft be fome wonderful Fund of Death and
Deftruaion in that Thing, able to. kill Man, Beaft,
Bird,
nilhment this created in him was fuch, as could
not wear off for a long Time; and I believe, if I
would have let him, he would have worfhipp'd
me and my Gun: As for the Gun itfelf, he would
not fo much as touch it for (everal Days after; but
would fpeak to it, and talk to it, as if it had an-
fwer'd him, when he was by himfelf; wnich, as I
afterwards learn'd of him, was to defire it not to
-kill him.
Well: After his Aftonifliment was a little over
at this, I pointed to him to run and fetch the Bird
I had mot, which he did, but ftay'd Torn* Time 5
for the Parrot not being quite dead, was^tter'd
a good Way off from the Place where {he fell;
however, he found her, took her up, and brought v
her to me ; and, as I had perceiv'd his Ignorance
about the Gun before, I took this Advantage to
charge the Gun again, and not let him fee me do
it, that I might be ready for any other Mark that
might prefent; but nothing more offer'd at that
Time; fo I brought home the Kid, and the fame
Evening took the Skin off, and cut it out as well
as I could ; and having a Pot for that Purpofe, I
boil'd or ftew'd Ibme of the Flefh, and made
fome very good Broth ; and after I had begun to
eat fome, I gave fome to my Man, who feenui
very glad of it, and lik'd it very well; but that
which was ftrangeft to him was to fee me eat
Salt with it; he made a Sign to me, that the Salt
was not good to eat, and putting a little into his
own Mouth, he feem'd to naufeate it, and would
fpit and fputter at it, warning his Mouth with frefh
Water after it; on the other Hand, I took fome
Meat in my Mouth without Salt, and I pretended
to fpit and fputter for want of Salt, as faft as he
had done at the Salt; but it would not do, he
would
would never care for Salt with his Meat, or in his
Broth J at leaft, not a great while, and then but a
Very little.
Having thus fed him with boil'd Meat and
Broth, I was refolv'd to feaft him the next Day
with roafting a Piece of the Kid ; this I did by hang-
ing it before the Fire in a String, as I had feen
many People in Enghnd, fetting two Poles up,
one on each Mde the Fire, and one crofs on the
Top, and tying the String to the crofs Stick, letting
the Meat turn continually: This Friday admir'd
very much; but when he came to talk the Flefti,
he took fo many Ways to tell me how well he lik'd
it, that I could not but underftand him ; and at
laft he told me he would never eat Man's Fklh
any more, which I was very glad to hear.
The next Day I fet him to work to beating fome
Corn out, and mting it in the Manner I ufed to do,
as I obferv'd before; and he foon underftood how
to do it as well as I, efpecially, after he had feen
what the Meaning of it was, and that it was to
make Bread of; for after that I let him fee me
make my Bread, and bake it too, and in a little
Time Friday was able to do all the Work for me,
as well as I could do it myfelf.
I began now to confider, that having two Mouths
to feed inftead of one, I muft provide more Ground
for my Harveft, and plant a larger Quantity o*
Corn than I ufed to do ^ fo I mark'd out a larger
Piece of Land, and began the Fence in the fame
Manner as before, in which Friday not only work d
my willingly and very hard, but .did it very
:hearfully ; and I told him what it was for, that it
i/ras for Corn to make more Bread, becaufe he was
low. with me, and that I might have enough for
!iim' and myfelf too: He appear'd very fenfible ot
' it Part, and let me know that he thought I had i fi
inuch. I
I had for my felt'; and that he would work the
harder for me, if I would tell him what to do.,
This was the pleafanteft Year of all the Life I led
in this Place: Friday began to talk pretty well, and
underftand the Names of almoft every Thing I had
Cccafion to call for, and of every Place I had to
fend him to, and talk a great deal to me ; fo that,
in fhort, I began now to have fome Ufe for my
Tongue again, which indeed I had very little Oc-
cafion for before y that is to faya about Speech: Be-
iides the Pleafure of talking to him, I had a flngu-
' lar Satisfa&ion in the Fellow himfelf ; his fimple
unfeign'd Honcfty appear'd to me more and more
. every Day. and I began really to love the Creature^
and on his Side, 1 believe he lov'd me more than it
was pcfiible for him ever to love any Thing before.
I had a Mind once to try if he had any hankering
Inclination to his own Country again ; and having
learn'd him Evglifh fo well, that he could anfwer me
almoftany Queftions, I afk'd him whether the Na-
" tion that he belong'd to never conquer'd in Battle ?
At which he fmil'd, and faid, Yes, yes, we always
fight the better ; that is, he mean'd always get the
better in Fight; and fo we began the following
Difcourfe: You always fight the better, faid I, How
came you to be taken Prifoner then, Friday?
Friday, My Nation beat much, for all that.
Mafter, How beat; if your Nation beat them,
how come you to be taken ?
Friday, They more many than my Nation in the
Place where me was ; they take one, two, three,
and me : my Nation over beat them in the yon-
der Place, where me no was; there my Natiou
take one, two, great Thoufand.
Majler, But why did not your Side recover you
from the Hands of your Enemies then ?
FriSq,
make go in the Canoe ; my Nation have no Canoe f oi
that Time. a/
Mafter, Well, Friday, and what does your Na. gt
tion do with the Men they take, do they cany
them away, and eat them as thefe did ?
Friday, Yes, my Nation eat Mans too, eat all
up.
Mafter, Where do they carry them ?
Friday, Go to other Place, where they think.
Majler, Do thoy come hither ?
Friday, Yes, yes, they come hither; come other
elfe Place.
Mafter, Have you been here with them?
Friday, Yes, I been here ; [points to the N. W. Side
of the IJlaud, which it feems was their Side.]
By this I underitood, that my Man Fridca had
formerly been among the Savages, who uied to
come on Shore on the farther Part of the Ifland,
on the faid Man-eating Occafions that he was now
brought for; and fome Time after, when I took
the Courage to carry him to that Side, being the
fame I formerly mention'd, he prefently knew
the Place, and told me, he was there once when
they eat up twenty Men, two Women, and one
Child: He could not tell twenty in EngliJI); but
he numbred them by laying fo many Stones on a
Row, and pointing to me to tell them over.
I have told this Paflage, becaufe it introduces
what follows ; that after I had had this Difcourle
.vith him, I ask'd him how far it was from our
ffland to the Shore, and whether the Canoes were
lot often loft; he told me, there was no Danger,
10 Canoes ever loft; but that after a little Way out
:o the Sea, there was a Current, and a Wind, al-
vays one Way in the Morning, the other in the
Afternoon.
This
of the Tide, as going out, or coming in; but I
afterwards underftood it was occafion'd by the
great Draft and Reflux of the mighty River Oroo-
ttooko ; in the Mouth or the Gulf of which River,
as I found afterwards, our Ifland lay; and this
Land, which I perceivM to the W. and N. W. was
the great Ifland Trinidad, on the N. Point of the
Mouth of the River. I afk'd Friday a thoufand
Queftions about the Country, the Inhabitants, the
Sea, the Coaft, and what Nation were near; he
told me all he knew, with the greateft Opennefs
imaginable. I alk'd him the Names of the feveral
Nations of his Sort of People, but could get no o-
ther Name than Caribs ; from whence I eafily un-
derftood, that thefe were the Caribbees, which our
Maps place on that Part of America which reaches
from the Mouth of the River Oroonooko to Guiana,
and onwards to St. Martha: He told me, that up a
great Way beyond theMoon, that was, beyond the
Setting of the Moon, which muft be Weft from
their Country, there dwelt white bearded Men,
like me, and pointed to my great Whifkers, which
I mention'd before ; and that they had kill'd much
Mans, that was his Word: By all which I under-
ftood, he mean'd the Spaniards, whofe Cruelties in
America had been fpread over the whole Countries,
and was remember'd by all the Nations, from Fa-
ther to Son.
I enquir'd if he could, tell me how I might come
from this Ifland, and get among thofe white Men;
he told me, yes, yes, I might go in two Canoe; I
could not underftand what he meant, or make him
defcribe to me what he meant by two Canoe, 'till at
laft, with great Difficulty, I found he meant it muft
be in a large great Boat, as big as two Canoes.
This
with me very well, and from this Time I enter-
tain'd fome Hopes, that one Time or other I
might find an Opportunity to make my Efcape
from this Place; and that this poor Savage might
be a Means to help me to do it.
During the long Time that Friday has now bee»
with me, and that he began to fpeak to me, and
underftand me, J was not wanting to lay a Foun-
dation of religious Knowledge in his Mind; par-
ticularly, I aik'd him one Time, Who made him?
The poor Creature did not underftand me at all,
but thought I had afk'd who was his Father: But
I took it by another Handle, and afk'd him who
made the Sea, the Ground we walk'd on, and the
Hills and Woods; he told me it was one old &•
vamvckee, that liv'd beyond all: He could defcribe
nothing of this great Perfon, but that he was very
old ; much older, he faid, than the Sea or the Land.
than the Moorj or the Stars: I afk'd him then, H
this old Perfon had made all Things, why did not
all Things worfhip him > He look'd very gra^e,
and with a perfedt Look of Innocence, faid, All
Things faid 0 to Mm: I afk'd. him if the People,
who die in his Country, went away anywhere?
He faid, Yes, they all went to Benamuckee : Then
I afk'd him, Whether thefe they eat up went thi-
ther too ? He faid, Yes.• . .
From thefe Things I began to inftruft him, in
the Knowledge of the true God. I told him, That
the great Maker of all Things liv'd up there,
pointing up towards Heaven: That he governs
the World by the fame Power and Providence by
which he had made it: That he -was Omnipotent,
could do every Thing for us, give every Thing to
us, take every Thing from us; and thus, by De-
grees, I open'd his Eyes. He liften'd with great At-
^ tention
jfeftu thrift, being fent to redeem us, and of the
Manner of making our Prayers to God, and his
being able to hear us, even into Heaven. He told
me one Day, that if our God could hear us up be-
yond the Sun, he muft needs be a greater God than
their Brnamnckee, who liv'd but a little Way off,
and yet could not hear,'till they went up to the
great Mountains where he dwelt, to fpeak to him:
I ask'd him if ever he went thither, to fpeak to
him? He faid, No, they never went that were
young Men; none went thither but the old Men,
who he call'd their Oowokakee, that is, as I made
him explain it to me, their Religious, or Clergy,
and that they went to fay 0, (fo he call'd faying
Prayers) and then came back, and told them
what Benamuckee faid. By this I obferv'd, That
there is Prie/tcraft, even amongft the moft blinded
ignorant Pagans in the World; and the Policy of
making a fecret Religion, in Order to preferve the
Veneration of the People to the Clergy, is not on-
ly to be found in the Roman, but perhaps among
all Religions in the World, even among the moft
brutifti and barbarous Savages.
I endeavour'd to clear up this Fraud to my
Man Friday, and told him, That the Pretence of
their old Men going up to the Mountains to fay O
to their God Benamuckfe. was a Cheat, and their'
bringing Word from thence what he faid, was
much more fo ; that if they met with any Anfwer,
or fpoke with any one there, it muft be with an
evil Spirit: And then I enter'd into a long Di£
courfe with him about the Devil, the Original of
him, his Rebellion againft God, his Enmity to
Man, the Reafon of it, his fetting himfelf up in
the dark Parts of the World to be worfbipM in-
ftead of God, and as God; and the many Strata-
S gems
Ruin ; how he had a fecret Accefs to our Patfions,
and to our Affe&ions, to adapt his Snares fo to our
Inclinations, as to caufe us even to be our own
Tempters, and to run upon our Deftrudtion by our
own Choice.
I found it was not fb eafy to imprint right No-
tions in his Mind about the Devil, as it was about
the Being of a God. Nature aflifted all my Argu-
ments to evidence to him even the NeceJfityoia
great firft Caufe and over.ruling governing Power,
a fecret directing Providence, and of the Equity
andjuftice of paying Homage to him that made
us, and the like. But there appear'd nothing of all
this in the Notion of an evil Spirit, of his Ori-
ginal, his Being, his Nature, and above all, of his
Inclination to do Evil, and to draw us in to do
fo too. And the poor Creature puzzl'd me once
in fuch a Manner, by a Queftion meerly natural
and innocent, that I fcarce knew what to fay to
him. I had been talking a great deal to him of
the Power of God, his Omnipotence, his dreadful
Averfionto Sin, his being a confuming Fire to the
Workers of Iniquity; how, as he had made us all,
he could deftroy us and all the World in a Mo-
ment ^ and he lifreu'd with great Serioufnefs to me
all the while.
After this, I had been telling him how the De-
vil was God's Enemy in the Hearts of Men, and
ufed all his Malice and Skill to defeat the good
Defigns of Providence, and to ruin the Kingdom
of Chrift in the World, and the like. Well, fays
Friday, but you fay, God is fo ftrong, fo great,
is he not much ftrong, much Might as the Devil?
Yes, yes, fays I, Friday, God is ftronger than the
Devil, Gcd is above the Devil, and therefore we
pray to God to tread him down under our Feet,
and
and enable us to refift his Temptations, and
qttench his fiery Darts. But, fays he again, if
God much ftrong, much Might as the Devil, why God
no kill the Devil, fo make Vim no more do wicked.
I was ftrangely furpriz'd at his Queftion, and
after all, tho' 1 was now an old Man, yet I was
but a young Doctor, and ill enough qualify'd for
a Cafuift, or a Solver of Difficulties : £nd, at firft, 0
I could not tell what to fay, fo I pretended not to
hear him, and ask'd him what he faid? But he
was too earneft for an Anfwer to forget his Que-
ftion ; fothat he repeated it in the very fame broken
Words, as above. By this Time I had recovered
myfeli a little, and I faid, God will at laft pum/j
him fever ely, be is refervd for the Judgment, and h
to be caft into the Bottomlefs Pit, to dwell with ever-
lafting Fire. This did not fatisfy Friday, but he
returns upon me, repeating my "Words, RESERVE
AT LAST, me no underJland, But, Why -not kill the
Devil -now, not kill great ago? You may as well ask
me, faid /, Why God does not kill you and I,
when we do wicked Things here that offend him ?
We are prelerv'd to repent and be pardon'd : He
mufes a while at this $ Well, well, fays he, mighty
affectionately, that well ; fo you, I, Devil, all wick-
ed, all prtfcrve, repent, God pardon all. Here I was
run down again by him to the laft Degree, and it
was a Teftimony to me, how the meer Notions of
Nature, though they will guide reafbnable Crea-
tures to the Knowledge of a God, and of a Wor-
fhip or Homage due to the fupreme Being of God,
as theConfeqiience of our Nature; yet nothing but
divine Revelation can form the Knowledge of Je-
fns Chift, and of a Redemption purchas'd for us, of a
Mediator ofthe new CoVenant,and of an Tnterceflbr,
&t the Footstool of God's Throne ., I fay, nothing
out a RevelEfttoh from Heaven, can form thefe in
S 2 the
the Soul} and that therefore the Gofpel of our
Lord and Saviour Jefm Ckrtft, I mean, the Word
of God, and the Spirit of God, promis'd for the
Guide and Sandifier of his People, are the abfo-
lutely neceflary Inftrudtors of the Souls of Men,
in the faving Knowledge of God, and the Means
of Sal ration.
I therefore diverted the prefent Difcourfe be-
tween me and my Man, rifing up haftily, as upon
fome Hidden Occafion of going out; then fending
him for fomething a good Way off,I ferioufly pray'd
„ to God, that he would enable me to inftrudt faving-
ly this poor Savage, ailifting by his Spirit the
Heart of the poor ignorant Creature, to receive
the Light of the Knowledge of God in Cbrijl, re-
conciling him to himfelf, and would guide me lp
fpeak fo to him from the Word of God, as his
Confcience might be convinc'd, his Eyes open'd,
and his Soul fav'd. When he came again to me, I
entred into a long Difcourfe with him upon the
Subjed of the Redemption of Man by the Saviour
of the World, and of the Podrineof the Gofpel
preach'd from Heaven, viz. of Repentance towards
God, and Faith in our blefTed Lord Jefus. I then
explain'd to him, as well as I could, why our
Blefled Redeemer took not on him the Nature of
Angels, but the Seed ef Abraham, and how for
that Reafon the fallen Angels had no Share in the
Redemption ^ that he came only to the loft Sheep
of the Houfe of Ifrael, and the like.
I had, God knows, more Sincerity than Know-
ledge, in all the Methods I took "for this poor
Creature's Inftruflion, and muft acknowledge what
I believe all that ad upon the fame Principle will
find, That in laying Things open to him, I really
inform'd and inftrudedrnyfelfinmanyThings,that
either I did not know, or had not fully confider'd
before;
 upon my (earthing into them, for the Information
of this poor Savage} and I had more Affection in
my Enquiry after Things upon this Occafion, than
ever I telt before ; fo that whether this poor wild
Wretch was the better for me, or no, I had great
Reafon to be thankful that ever he came to me:
My Grief fate lighter upon me, my Habitation
grew comfortable to me beyond Meafurej and
vvhen I reflected that in this folitary Life, which I
had been V;onfin'd to, I had not only been mov'd
myfelfto lookup to Heaven, and to feek to the
Hand that had brought me there; but was now
to be made an Inftrument under Providence to fave
the Life, and, for ought I know, the Soul of a poor
Savage, and bring him to the true Knowledge of
Religion, and of the Chriftian DoSrine, that he
might knowChriftJefus, to knowbom is Life eter-
nal ; I fay, When I reflected upon all thefe Things,
a fecret Joy run through every Part of my Soul,
and I frequently rejoic'd that ever I was brought to
this Place, which I had fo often thought the moft
dreadful of all Affli&ions that could poffibly have
befallen me.
In this thankful Frame I continu'd all the Re*
tnainder of my Time, and the Converfation which
employ'd the Hours between Friday and I, was
fuch, as made the three Years which we liv'd there
together perfectly and compleatly happy Jfanyfmb
Thing as complcat Happinefs can be forma in a fvllv-
nary State. The Savage was now a good Chrifti-
an, a much better than I; though I have Reafon
to hope, and blefs God for it, that we were equally
penitent, and comforted reftor'd Penitents; we
had here the Word of God to read, and no farther
off from his Spirit to inftrua, than if we had been
• in England.
83 I always
ture, to let him know, as well as I could, the
Meaning of what I read; and he again, by his fe.
rious Enquiries and Queftions, made me, as I
[aid before, a much better Scholar in the Scripture
Knowledge, than I Ihould ever have been by my
own private meer Reading. Another Thing I can-
not refrain from obferving here alfo from Experi-
ence, in this rctir'd Part of my Life, viz. How in-
finite and ineypreiftble a BlelFmg it is, that the
Knowledge of God, and of the Dodrine of Salva-
tion by Cbrift Jefm, is fo plainly laid down in the
Word of God, fo eafy to be receiv'd and under-
Rood, that as the bare Reading the Scripture
made me capable of understanding enough of
my Duty, to carry me directly on to the great
Work of fincere Repentance for my Sins, and lay-
ing hold of a Saviour for Life and Salvation, to a
Mated Reformation in Practice, and Obedience to
all God's Commands, and this without any Tegch.
er or Inftructer (I mean, humane) • fo the fame
plain Inftruction fufficiently ferv'd to the Enlight-
ning this Savage Creature, and bringing him to
be fuch a Chrittian, as I have known few equal to
him in my Life. •' ••
As to all the Difputes, Wranglings, Strife, and
Contention, which ha.shappen'd in the World about
Religion, whether Niceties in Doctrines, or Schemes

Things, and take every Part in its Order.
After Friday and I became more intimately ac-
quainted, and that he could underftand almoft all
1 laid to him, and fpeak fluently, tho3 in broken
EygliJI), to me ; I acquainted him with my own
Story, or at leaft fo much of it as related to my
coming into the Place, how I had liv'd there, and
how long. I let him into the Mtyftery, for fuch
jt was to him, of Gunpowder and Bullet, and
taught him how to moot : I gave him a Knife,
which he was wonderfully delighted with, and I
made him a Belt, with a Frog hanging to it, fuch
as in ErgUrid we wear Hangers in -^ and in the Frog,
inftead of 3 Hanger, I gave him a Hatchet, which
was not only as good a Weapon in Ibme Cafes, but
much more ufeful upon other Occafions.
I defcrib'd' to him the Country of Europe, and
particularly F.itgland, which I came from; how we
liv'd, how we worlhipp'd God, how we behav'd
to onp another ; and how we traded in Ships to all
Parts of the World : I gave him an Account of the
Wreck'which I had been on board of, aiid fliew'd
him, as near as I could, the Place where me lay ;
but me was all beaten in Pieces before, and gone.
I fhew'd'him the Ruins of our Boat, which we
loft when we efcap'd, and which I could not ftir
with my whole Strength then, but was now fallen
almoft all to Pieces: Upon feeing this Boat, Friday
ftood muling a great while, and faid nothing; I
afk'd him what it was he ftudyxl upon; at laft, fays
he, mefeefncb Boat like come io Place at my Nation.
I did not imderftand him a good while ; but at
laft, when I had examin'd farther into it, I under-

that is, as he explain'd it, was driven thither by J
Strefsof Weather: I prefently imagin'd, that fome bei
European Ship muft have been caft away upon their ' of
Coaft, and the Boat might get loofe, and drive a- in i
Riore, but was fo dull, that I never once thought of
of Men making Efcape from a Wreck thither, much loc
lefs whence they might come 5 fb I only enquir'd in
after a Defcription of the Boat. an<
Friday defcrib'd the Boat to me well enough; but froi
brought me better to understand him, when he ad- 0,
ded with fome Warmth, wefave the white Mans from fAe».'
drovn: Then I prefently aik'd him, if there was a- (
ny white Mans, as he call'd them, in the Boat: Tes, pea
he faid, tie Boat full of white Mans: I afk'd him Co
how many ^ he told upon his Fingers feventeen: he
[ afk'd him then, what became of them ; he told an(
me, thy live, they dwell at my Nation. Th
This put new Thoughts into my Head ; for I eal]
prefently imagin'd, that thefe might be the Men and
belonging to the Ship that was caft away in Sight I bac
sf my Ifland, as I now call it ; and who, after the | f0r,
Ship was ftruck on the Rock, and they faw her j me
inevitably loft, had fav'd themfelves in their Boat,
md were landed upon that wild Shore, among the
savages. | Fes
Upon this, I enquir'd of him more critically il he
•vhat was become of them; he affur'd me they the
iiv'd ftill there; that they had been there about
bur Years ; that the Savages let them alone, an<J
jave them Victuals to live. I afk'd him, how it
rame to pafs they did not kill them and eat them ; | fQ
he faid, No, they make Brother with them ; that is,
is I underftood him, a Truce : And, then he ad-
led, Tbe% no eat Mans but when make the VaY fykt: ne
That is to fay, they never eat any Men, but
fuch
fuch as come to fight with them, and are taken
in Battle.
It was after this, fome confiderable Time, that
being on the Top of the Hill, at the Eaft Side
of the Ifland, from whence, as I have faid, I had
in a clear Day difcover'd the Main, or Continent
of Amenw: Friday, the Weather being very ferene,
looks very earneftly towards the main Land, and
in a kind' of Surprize, falls a jumping and dancing,
and calls out to me, for I was at fome Diftance
from him: I afk'd him what was the Matter $
0, Joy ! fays he, 0 Glad ! There fee my Country,
there my Nation!
I obferv'd an extraordinary Senfe of Pleafareap-
pear'd in his Face, and his Eyes fparkled, and his
Countenance difcover'd a flrange Eagernefs, as if
he had a Mind to be in his own Country again ;
and this Obfervation of mine put a great many
Thoughts into me, which made me at firft not fo
eafy about my new Man Friday as I was before;
and I made no Doubt, but that if Friday could get
back tp his own Nation again, he would not only
forget all his Religion, but all his Obligation to
me, and would be forward enough to give his
Countrymen an Account of me, and come back per-
haps, with a hundred or two of them, and make a
Feaft upon me, at which he might be as merry as
he u(ed to be with thofe of his Enemies, when
they were taken in War.
But I wrong'd the poor honeft Creature very
much, for which I was very forry afterwards.
However, as my Jealoufy increas'd, and held me
fome Weeks, I was a little more circumfpecl:, and
not fo familiar and kind to him as before; in
which I was certainly in the Wrong too, the ho-
neft grateful Creature having no Thought about it,
but what confifted with the beft Principles, both
as
as a religious Chriftian, and as a grateful Friend,
as appear'd afterwards to my full Satisfaction.
While my Jealoufy of him lafted, you may be
fure I was every Day pumping him, to fee if he
would difcover any of the new Thoughts which I
fufpeded were in him \ but I found every Thing
he fa :d was fo honeft, and fb innocent, that I
could find nothing to nourim my Sufpirion ; and,
in fpite of all my Uneafinefs, he made me at laft
entirely his own again, nor did he in the leal!
perceive that I was uneafy, and therefore I could
not fufpect him of Deceit.
One Day walking up the fame Hill, but the
Weather being haizy at Sea, fo that we could not
fee the Continent, I call'd to him, and faid, Fri-
<foy, do not you wifh yourfelf in your own Coun-
try, your own Nation > Tes, he faid, / be mucb 0
glad to be at my own Ration. What would you do
there, faid I, would yon torn wild again, eat Mens
Fleth again, and be a Savage as you were before ?
He look'd full of Concern, and lhaking his Head,
Paid, No, -n0, Friday tell them to live good, tell Am
to pray God, tell them to eat Corn-Bread, Cattle-Fle/b,
Milk, no eat Man again : Why then, faid I to him,
They mil kill yon. He look'd grave at that, and
;hen faid. No, they .no kill me. they willing love learn:
He meant by this, they would be willing to learn.
He added, they learn'd much of the Bearded Mans
:hat come in the Boat. Then I afk'd him if he
vould go back to them ? He fmil'd at that, and
old me he could not fwim fo far. I told him I
A'ould make a Canoe for him. He told me, he
vould go if I would go with him. I go! fays K
tfhy, they will eat me if I come there ? No, >»,
ays he, me make they m eat you, me make thy vncb
eve yov. He meant, he would tell them how I hart
:ill'd his Enemies, and fav'd his Life, and fo he
.• •
well as he could, how kind they were to feventeeji
white Men, or bearded Men, as he call'd them,
who came on Shore there in Diftrefs.
From this Time, I confefs, I had a Mind to
venture over, and fee if I could poflibly join with
thefe bearded Men, who, I made no Doubt, were
Spaniards or Portuguefe; not doubting but, if I could,
we might find fome Method to efcape from
thence, being upon the Continent, and a good
Company together, better than I could from an
Ifland 40 Miles off the Shore, and alone without
Help. So, after fome Days, I took Friday to work
again, by way of Difcourfe, and told him I would
give him a Boat to go back to his own Nation ,
and accordingly I carry'd him to my Frigate,
which lay on the other Side of the Ifland, and ha-
ving clear'd it of Water, for I always kept it funk
in the Water, I brought it out, fhew'd it him, and
we both went into it.
I found he was a moft dextrous Fellow at ma-
naging it, would make it go almoft as fwift and
faft again as I could; fo when he was in, I faid to
him, Well, now, Friday, {hall we go to your Na-
tion ? He look'd very dull at my faying fo, which,
it feems, was, becaufe he thought the Boat. too
fmall to go fo far. I told him then I had a bigger-,
fo the next Day I went to the Place where the
firft Boat lay which I had made, but which I could
not get into Water : He faid that was big enough j
but then, as I had taken no Care of it, and it had
lain two or three and twenty Years there, the Sun
had fplit and dry'd it, that it was in a Manner
rotten. Friday told me,- fuch a Boat would do ve-
ry well, and would carry much enough Vittk, Drittk,
fyead, that H^S his Way of Talking. {
*•..', •• . *..,... .,..,. .... '
upon my ,T)efign of going over with him to the
Continent, that I told him we would go and make
one as big as that, and he fhould go home in it.
He anfwer'd not one Word, but look'd very grave
and fad : I aik'd him what was the Matter with
him; he aflt'd me again thus, ffby you angry mad
with Friday, vbat me done ? I alk'd him what he
meant; I told him I was not angry with him at all.
No ottgry! No angry! fays he, repeating the Words
feveral Times, Why fend Friday borne away to ntj
Nation ? Why, fays I, Friday, did you not lay you
wifh'd you were there ? Tes, yes, fays he, wijb be botb
there, no viJJi Friday there, no Majler tltre. In a
Word, he would not think of going there without
me: I go there, Friday, fays I, what fhall I do
there ? He turn'd very quick upon me at this: Ton
do great deal much Good, fays he, you teach wild Maffi
te good fober tame Mam ; you tell them know Got,
fray God, and live new Life. Alas, Friday, fays I,
thou knoweft not what thou fay'ft, I am but an
ignorant Man myfelf. Tes, yes, fays he, you teacki
me Geod, you teachee them Good. No, no, Friday,
fays I, you (hall go without me; leave me here to
live by myfelf, as I did before. He look'd confus'd
again at that Word, and running to one of the
Hatchets which he ufed to wear, he takes it up
haftily, and gives it me, What muft I do with this?
fays I to him : Tou take kill Friday, fays he:
What mufl: I kill you for ? faid I again. He re-
turns very quick, Wbtrt you fend Friday away
for ? take kill Friday, no fend Friday emay. This
he fpoke fo earneftly, that I faw Tears ftand
in his Eyes. In. a Word, I fq plainly difcover'd
the utmoft Affection in him to me, and a firm Re-
folution in him, that I told him then, and often
after, that I would never fend him away from
, if he was willing to flay with me.
a fettled Affedtion to me, and that nothing fhould
part him from me, fo I found all the Foundation
of his Delire to go to his own Country, was laid
in his ardent Affection to the People, and his Hopes
of my doing them Good ; a Thing which as I had
no Notion of myfelf, fo I had not the leaft Thought,
or Intention, or Defire of undertaking it. But ftill
I found a ftrong Inclination to my attempting an
•Efcape, as above, founded on the Suppofition ga-
ther'd from the Difcourfe, (viz.) That there were
feventeen bearded Men there; and therefore, with-
out any more Delay, I went to work with Friday
to find out a great Tree proper to fell, and make a
large Periagua or Canoe to undertake the Voyage.
There were Trees enoagh in the Ifland to have
built a little Fleet, not of Periaguas and Canoes,
but even of good large VefTels. But the main Thing
I look'd at, was to get one fo near the Water, that
we might launch it when it was made, to avoid
the Miftake I committed at firft.
At laft, Friday pitch'd upon a Tree, for I found he
knew much better than I what Kind of Wood was
fitteft for it; nor can I tell, to this Day,what Wood
to call the Tree we cut down, except that it was
very like the Tree we call Fvjlic, or between that
and the Nicaragua Wood, for it was much of the
fame Colour and Smell. Friday was for burning the
Hollow or Cavity of this Tree out to make it for
a Boat: But I fhew'd him how rather to cut it out
with Tools; which, after I had fhew'd him how
to ufe,hedid very handily, and in about a Month's
hard Labour we finifh'd it, and made it very
handfbme, efpecially when with our Axes, which I
fhew'd him how to handle, we cut and hew'd the
Out-fide into the true Shape of a Boat; after this,
however, it coft us near a Fortnight's Time to get
her
her along, as it were, Inch by Inch upon great I
Rowlersinto the Water. But when fhe was in, {he Wor
would have carry'd twenty Men with gtefct for I
Eafe. Stay
When fhe was in the Water, and tho' fhe wasfo ihou
big, it amaz'd me to fee with what Dexterity and thai
how fwift my Man Friday would manage her, turn ftee
her, and paddle her along; fo I aik'd him if he wri;
would, and if we might venture over in her ^ Tes, he Nee
faid, be venter over in Iter very well, tbo'great blov- foij]
Wind. However, I had a farther Defign that he pafs,
knew nothing of, and that was to make a Mail and I bat]
Sail, and to fit her with an Anchor and Cable: As mud
to a Maft, that was eafy enough to get; fo I pitch'd AJ
upon a ftrait yofing Cedar-Tree, which I found day
near the Place, and which there was great Plenty of
of in the Ifland.; and I fet Friday to work to cut it pad<
down, and gave him Directions how to fhape and a
order it. But as to the Sail, that was my particular
Care ; I knew I had old Sails, or rather Pieces of
old Sails enough ; but as I had had them now fill'd
26 Years by me, and had not been very care. chan;
ful to preferve them, not imagining that I fhould one a
ever have this kind of life for them, I did not doubt
but they were all rotten/ and indeed moft of them
were fo j however, I found two Pieces which ap- Cpm
pear'd pretty good, and with thefe I went to work, ot
and with a great deal of Pains, and awkward tedi-
ous ftitching (you may be fure) for Want of Needks,
I at length made a Three-corner'd ugly Thing, Me
what we call in England, a Shoulder of Mutton
Sail, to go with. a Boom at Bottom, and a little
fhort Sprit at the Top, fuch as ufually our Ships the:
Long-Boats fail with, and fuch as I heft knew how
to manage; becaufe it was fuch a one. as I had to
the Boat in which I made my Efcape frofn Bar.-
bary, as related in the firft Part of my Story.
Iwa?
I was near two Months performing this laft
Work, viz. rigging and fitting my Maft and Sails j
for I finifh'd them very compleat, making a fmall
Stay, and a Sail, or Forefail to it, to aflift, if we
ihould turn to Windward; and which was more
than all, I fix'd a Rudder to the Stern of her, to
fteer with; and tho11 was but a bungling Ship-
wright, yet as I knew the Ufefulnefs, and even
Neceffity of fuch a Thing, I apply'd myfelf with
fo much Pains to do it, that at laft I brought it to
pafs, tho' confidering the many dull Contrivances
I had for it that fail a, I think it coft me almoft as
much Labour as making the Boat.
After all this was done too, I had my Man Fri-
day to teach as to what belong'd to the Navigation
of my Boat; for tho' he knew very well how to
paddle a Canoe, he knew nothing what belong'd to
a Sail and a Rudder, and Was the moft ama'zd
when he faw me work the Boat too and again in
the Sea by the Rudder, and how the Sail gyb'd, and
fill'd this Way or that Way, as the Courfe we fail'd
chang'd; I fay, when he faw this, he ftood like
one aftonim'd and amaz'd: However, with a little
Ufe, I made all thefe Things familiar to him ; and
he became an expert Sailor, except that as to the
Compafs, ILfould make him underftand very little
of that. On the other Hand, as there was very little
cloudy Weather, and feldom or never any Fogs in
thofe Parts, there was the lefs Occafion for a Com-
pafs, feeing the Stars were always to be feen by
Night, and the Shore by Day, except in the rainy
Seafons, and then no Body cared to ftir abroad, ei-
ther by Land or Sea.
I was now enter'd on the feven and twentieth
Year of my Captivity in this Place ^ tho1 the
three laft Years that I had this Creature with me,
ought rat her to be left out of the Account, my Ha-
bitation
reft of the Time. I kept the Anniverfary of my
landing here with the fame Thankfulnefs to God
for his Mercies, as at firft ^ and if I had fuch Caufe
of Acknowledgment at firft, I had much more Co
now, having fnch additional Teftimonies of the
Care of Providence over me, and the great Hopes
I had of being effedrually and fpeedily deliver'd;
for I had an invincible Impreffion upon my
Thoughts, that my Deliverance was at hand, and
that I mould not be another Year in this Place:
However, I went on with my Hufbandry, digging,
planting, fencing, as ufual; Igather'daridcur'dmy
Grapes, and did every nee efiary Thing, as before.
The rainy Seafon was in the mean Time upon
me, when I kept more within Doors than at other
Times j fo I had ftow'd our new VefTel as fecure as
we could, bringing her up into the Creek, where,
as I faid in the Beginning, I landed myRafts from
the Ship, and haling her up to the Shore, at High
Water Mark, I made my Man Friday dig a little
Dock, juft big enough to hold her, and juft deep e-
nough to give her Water enough to float in ; a«"
then, when the Tide was out, we made a ftroflg
Dam crofs the End of it, to keep the Water out;
and fo fhe lay dry, as to the Tide, from the Sea;
and to keep the Rain off, we laid a great many
Boughs of Trees, fo thick, thai fhe was as well
thatch'd as a Houfe ; and thus we waited for the
Month of November and December, in which I de-
(ign'd to make my Adventure.
When the fettled Seafon began to come in, as
rhe Thought of my De%n return'd with the fair
Weather, I was preparing daily for the Voyage;
md the firft Thing I did, was to lay by a certain
Quantity of Provifions, being the Stores for our
Voyage j and intended, in a Week or a Fortnight"
Time,
Time, to open the Dock, and launch out our Boaf.
1 was bufy one Morning upon Ibme Thing of this
kind, when I call'd to Friday, and bid him go to the
i-'ea Shore, and fee if he could find a Turtle, or
Tortoife, a Thing which we generally got once a
Week, for the Sake of the Lggs, as well as the
Flelh: Fi Iday had not been long gone, when he
came running back, and flew over my outer Wall,
or Fence, like one that felt not.the Ground, or the
Steps he fet his Feet on j and before I had Time to
fpeak to him, he cries out to me, 0 Majler ! Ma-
Jler! 0 Sorrow ! 0 bad! What's the Matter, Friday,
fays I ; 0 ywder, tbsre, fays he, one, two, three Canoe !
otie, two, three! By his way of fpeaking, I conclu-
ded these were fix ; but on Enquiry I found it was
but three: Well, Friday, fays 1, do not be frighted 5
fo I hearten'd him up as well as I could: However,
1 faw the poor Fellow was inoft teiribly fcaAl; for
nothing ran in his Head but that they were come to
look for him, and would cut him in Pieces, and eat
him; and the poor Fellow trembled fo, that I
fcarce knew what to do with him : I comforted him
as well as I could, and told him I was in as much
Danger as lie, and that they would eat me as well as
him., but, fays I, Friday, we mift.refvlve tofyht ibem\
Can you fglt, Friday ? Me Jboot, fays he, but there
come many great Number. No matter for that, laid
I again, our Guns will fright them that we do not
kill ;. fo I aik'd him, Whether if I refolv'd to defend
him, he would defend me, and ftand by me, and do
jultas I bid him? He faid, Me die, when you bid djer
Maftcri fo I went and fetch'd a good* Dram of
ftum, and gave him; for I h,ad been fo good a Huf-
band of rny Rum, that I had a great deal left:
When he had drank it, I made him tak£ the two
Fowling-Pieces, which we alWays carry'd, and Ioa4 '
them with large Swan-Shot, as big as fmall Piftol
T' BulletS i
with two Slugs, ana five fmall Bullets each; and
my two Piftols I loaded with a Brace of Bullets
each; I hung my great .v word as ufual, naked by
my Side, and gave Friday his Hatchet.
When I had thus prepar'd my fe if, I took my Per-
fpedive-Glafs, and went up to the Side of the Hill,
to fee what I could diicover ; and I found quickty,
b}r my Glafs, that tfiere were one and twenty Sava-
ges, three Prifoners, and three Canoes-, and that
their whole Bufinefs feem'd to be the triumphant
Banquet upon thefe three humane Bodies, (a barba-
rous fieaft indeed) but nothing more than as I had
obferv'd was ufual with them.
lobferv'd alfo, that they were landed not where
the)' had done when Friday made his Efcape, but
nearer to my Creek, where the Shore was low, and
where a thick Wood came clofe almoft down to the
S2a : This, with the Abhorrence of the inhumane
Errand thefe Wretches cam'e about, fill'd me with
fuch Indignation, that I came down again to Fridfy
and told him, I was refolv'dto go down to them,
and kill them all; andaiVd him if he would ftand
by me> He had now gotten over his Fright, and
his Spirits being a little rais'd with the Dram I had
given him, he was very chearful, and told me, as
before, fee would die, when I bid die.
In this Fit of Fury, I took firft and divided the
Arms which I had charg'd, as before, between us:
I gave FJ iday one Piftol to flick in his Girdle, and
three Guns upon his Shoulder ; and I took oue Pi-
frof, and the other three rrry felf; and in this Po.
fture we marcVd out: I took a fmall Bottle of Rum
in my Pocket, and gave Friday a large Bag, with
more Powder and Bullet:, and, as to Orders, 1
rharg'd him to keep clofe behind 'me, and not to
ftir, or (hoot, or do any Thing, till 1 bid him; and
in the mean Time, not to fpeak a Word : In this
Pofture I fetch'd a Compafs to my Right Hand of
near a Mile, as well to get over the Creek, as to
get into the Wocd ;, fo that Tmight cume within
Shot of them before I fhould be ctifcover'd, which
I had feen by my Glafs it was eafy to do.
While I was making this March, my former
Thoughts returning, I began to abate my Refolu-
tion ; I do not mean, that I entertain'd Bny Fear
of their Number $ for as they were naked, unarm'd
Wretches, 'tis certain I was fuperior to them; nay,
though I had been alone ^ but it occnrr'd to my
Thoughts, What Call? What Occafion? much
lefs, What Necelfity I was in to go and dip my
Hands in Blood, to attack People, who had neither
done, or intended me any Wrong? Who, as tome,
were innocent, and whofe barbarous Cuftoms were
their own Difafter, being in them a Token indeed
of God's having left them, with the other Nations
of that Part of the World, to fuch Stupidity and
to fuch inhumane Courfes^ but did not call me to
take upon me to be a Judge of their Actions, much
lefs an Executioner of his Juftice ; that whenever
he thought fit, he would take the Caufe into his
own Hands, and by National .Vengeance puniih
them as a People for National Crimes ; but that,
in the meantime, it was none of myBufinefs; that
it was true, Friday might juftify it, becaufe he was
a declar'd Enemy, and in a State of War with thofe
very particular People; and it was lawful for him
to attack them; but I could not fay the fame with
refpect to me. Thefe Things were fo warmly
prefs'd upon my Thoughts, all the Way as I went,
that I refolv'd I would only go and place inyfelf
near them, that I might obferve their barbarous
Feaft, and that I would act then as God fhould
direct; but tlfat unlefs fomething offer'd that was
T 2 more
•meddle with them.
With this Rclblution 1 enter'd the Wood, and
with all poliible Warynefs and Silence, Ft May fol-
lowing clofe at my Heels, I marcful till 1 came
to the Skirt of the Wood, on the Side which was
next to them ; only that one Corner ot the Wood
lay between me and them ; here I call'd foftly to
Friday, and Iriewing him a great Tree, which was
juft at the Corner of the Wood, I bad him go to
the Tree, and bring me Word if he could fee there
plainly what they were doing : he did fo, and came
immediately back to me, and told me they might
lie plainly view'd there; that they were all about
their Fire, eating the Flelh of one of their Prifo-
hers; and that another lay bound upon the Sand,
a little from them, which'hc laid they would kill
next, and which fir'd all the very Soul within me.,
he told me it was not one of their Nation, but one
of the bearded Men, who he had told me of, that
came to their Country in the Boat: I was fill'd
with Horror at the veiy naming the white-bearded
Man, and going to the Tree, I law p1ainty,by my
Glafs, a white Man who lay upon the Beach of
the Sea, with his Hands and his Feet ty'd with
Flags, or Things likeRnnVs j and that he was an
European, and had.Cloaths on.
There was another Tree, and a little Thidcet
beyond it 'about fifty Tare's nearer to them than
the Place where I was, which by goin^ a little way
about. I faw J mi^ht cotne at undifcover'd, and
that then Ifhonld be within half Shot of them; fo
I .with.held my PfflTmn, though I was indeed en-
rag'd to the higheft Degree, and going back about
twenty Paces, I got behind. frme Bufhes, which held
all .the way, till" I came to the other Tree; and then
1 came to a littk ri/ing Ground, which gave me a
full
full View of them, at tlie Diftance of about eigh-
ty Yards.
' I had now not a Moment to lofe ; for nineteen
of the dreadful Wretches fate upon the Ground, all
dole huddled together, and had jult fent the other
two to butcher the poor Cbriftia*, and bring him,
perhaps, Limb by Limb, to their Fire, and they
were ftoop'd down to untie the Bands at his Feet:
J turn'd to Friday, now Friday, faid I, do as I bid
thte ; Fiiday faid he would ; then, Friday, fays I,
do exactly as you fee me do, fail in nothing : So I
iet down one of the MuLkets, and the Fowling-
Piece, upon the (jround, and Ftidaydid. the like
by his ^ and with the other Muiket I took my
Aim at the Savages, bidding him do the like; then
afking him if he was ready, he faid, yes, then
fire at them, faid 1} and the fame Moment I fir'd
zilfo.
Friday took .his Aim fo much better than I, that
on the Side that he mot, he kilFd two of them,
and wounded three more; and on my Side, I kill'd
one and wounded two. They were, you may be
{lire, in a dreadful Confteination ; and all of them,
who were not hurt, jump'd up upon their Feet,
but did not immediately know which- Way to run,
or which Way to look ; for they knew not from
whence their Deflrudtion came; Friday kept his
Eyes clofe upon me, that as I had bid him, he
might obferve what I did \ fo, as foon as the firft
Shot was made, I threw dou-n the Piece, arid took
up the Foiling.Piece, and Ftiday did the like; he
fee me cock, and prefent, he did the fame again -j
Are you ready, Friday ? laid I ; Yes, fays he ; let
fly then, fays I, in the Name of God, and with
that I fir'd again among the amaz'd Wretches, and
fo did Friday., and as our Pieces were now loaden
with what I call'd Swan Shot, or fmall Piftol Bui-
T ? lets
lets, we found only two drop; but fo many were
wounded, that they ran about yelling and ikream-
ing like mad Creatures, all bloody, and miferably
wounded moft of them ; whereof three more fell
quickly after, though not quite dead.
Now, Friday, fays I, (laying down the difcharg'd
Pieces, and taking up the Muiket, which was yet
loaden) follow me, fays I, which he did, with a
great deal of Courage $ upon which I rulh'd out of
the Wood, and ftiew'd myfelf, and Friday clofe at
my Foot j-as foon as I perceiv'd they faw me, I
fhouted as loud as I could, and bad Friday do fo
too} and running as fail as I could, which, by the
$Tay, was not very faft, being loaden with Arms as
". .I Ivas, I made diredtly towards the poor Viflim,
who was, as I faid, lying upon the Beach, or Shore, "
between the Place where they fate and the Sea;
the two Butchers, who were juft going to work
with him, had left him, at the Surprize of ourfirft
Fire, and fled in a terrible Fright to the Sea.fide,
and hadjump'd into a Canoe, and three more of the
reft made the fame Way: I turn'd to Friday, and bid
him ftep forwards, and fire at them; he under-
ftood me immediately, and running about forty
Yards to be near them, he fhot at them, and I
thought he had HUM them all, for I fee them all
fall of a Heap into the Boat ; though I faw two of
them up again quickly : However, he kill'd two
of them, and wounded the third ; fo that he lay
down in the Bottom of the Boat, as if he had been
dead.
AV.hile my Man Friday fir'd at them, I pull'd out
mv Knife, and cut the Flags that bound the poor
Vidim, and loofing his Hands and Feet, I lifted
him up, and afk'd him, in the Pmtvgueje Tongue,
What he was ? He anfw.er'd in Latin < CJiriftiam ;
but was fo weak and faint, that he could fcarce
{land,
ket, and gave it him, making Signs that he Ihould
drink, which he did; and I gave him a Piece of
Bread, which he eat; Then I atk'd him, What
Countryman he was ? And he faid, Efpagniole ^ and
being a little recover'd, let me know by all the
Signs he could poflibly make, how much he was
in my Debt tor his Deliverance: Seignior, faid 1^
with as much Spanijb as I could make up, we will
•talk afterwards, but we muft fight now j if you
have any Strength left, take this Piftol and Sword,
and lay about you. He took them very thankfully,
.and no fooner had he the Arms in his Hands, but
as if they had put new Vigour into him, he flew
upon his Murderers like a Fury, and had cut two
of them in Pieces in an Inftant; for the Truth is,
as the Whole was a Surprize to them, fo the poor
Creatures were fo much frighted with the Noife of
our Pieces, that they fell down for mere Amaze-
ment and Fear, and had no more Power to at- •
tempt their own Ffcape, than their Flefti had to».
refift our Shot; and that was the Cafe of thofe five
that Friday fhot at in the Boat; for as three of
them fell with the Hurt they receiv'd, fo the other
two fell with the Fright.
I kept my Piece in my Hand ftill, without firing,
being willing to keep my Charge ready, .becaufe I
had given the Spaniard my Piftol and Swords ; fo I
call'd to Friday, and bad him run up to the Tree
from whence we firfl fir'd, and fetch the Arms
which lay there, that had been difcharg'd, which
he did with great Swiftnefs ; and then giving him
my Mulket, I fat down myfelf to load all the reft
again, and bad them coirfe to me when they want-
ed. While I was loading thefe Pieces, there hap-
pen'd a fierce Engagement between the Spaniard
and onq of the Savages,who made at him with one of
T 4 their
was to have kill'd him before, if I had not prevent-
ed it: The Spaniard,' who was as bold and as brave
as coul3 be imagin'd, though weak, had fought
this Indian a good while, and had cut him two
great Wounds on his Head; but the Savage being
a ftout hilly Fellow, clofing in with him, haa
thrown him down, being faint, and was wringing
my Sword out of his Hand, when the Spaniard, tho'
undcrmoflr, wifely quitting the Sword, drew the
• Piftol from his Girdle, fhot the S.ivage through
the Body, and kill'd him upon the Spot, before 1,
who was running to help him, could come near
him.
Friday being now left to his Liberty, purfu'dthe
flying Wretches with no Weapon in his Hand but
his Hatchet; and with that he difpatchi'd thofe
three, who, as I faid before, were wounded at firft,
and fallen, and all the reft he could come up with;
.and the Spaniard coming to me for a Gun, I gave
him one of the Fowling-Pieces, with which he
purfu'd two of the Savages, and wounded them
both ; but as he was not able to run, they both goi
from him into the Wood, where Fiiday purfu'd.
them, and kill'd one of them ; but the other was
too nimble for him; and tho' he was wounded, yet
had plung'd himfelf into the Sea, and fwam with
all his Might off to thofe two who were left in the
Canoe, which three in the Canoe, with one wound-
ed who we know not whether he dy'd or no, were
all that efcap'd our Hands of one and twenty : The
Account of the reft is as follows :

2 Kill'd at the next Shot.
2 KilUd by Fiiday in the Boat.

not dead.
:' '. 9 .. •
21 In all.
Thofe that were in the Canoe, work'd hard to
get out of Gun-Shot; and though Friday made two
or three Shot at them, I did not find that he hit
any of them. P> iday would fain have had me took
one of their Canoes, and purfu'd them; and indeed
I was very anxious about their Efcape, leaft carry-
ing the News Home to their People, they fhould
come back, perhaps, with two or three hundred of
their Canoes, and devour us by mere Multitude; fo
I confented to purfue them by Sea, and running to
oiie of their Canoes, I jump'd in, and bad Fi iday
. follow me ; but when I was in the Canoe, I was
I furpriz'd to find another poor Creature lie there a-
live, bound Hand and Foot, as the Spaniard was,
for the Slaughter, and almoft dead with Fear, no4»
knowing what the Matter was; for he had not been
; able to look up over the Side of the Boat, he was
ty'd fb hard, Neclc and Heels, and had been ty'd fo
I long, that he had really but little Life in him.
I immediately cut the twifted Flags, or Rumrs,
which they had bound him with, and would have
helped him up; but he could not (land, or fpeak,
but groan'd moft p"iteoufly, believing (it feems) ftill
that he was only unbound in order to be kill'd.
When Friday came to him, I bad him fpeak to
hjm, and tell him of his Deliverance, and pulling
out my Bottle,'made him give the poor Wretch a
! '',' •' Dram,
Dram, which, with the News of his being deli-
ver'd, reviv'd him, and he fate up in the Boat; but
when Friday came to hear him fpeak, and look
in his Face, it would have mov'd any one to Tears,
*to have feen how Friday kifs'd him, embrac d him,
hugg'd him, cry'd, laugh'd, hollow'd, jump'd a.
bout, danc'd, fung, then cry'd again, wrung his
Hands, beat his own Face and Head, and then
Jung, and jump'd about again, like a diftracted
Creature : It was a good while before I could make
him fpeak to me, or tell me what was the Matter;
but when, he came a little to himfelf, he told me,
that it was his Father.
It is not eafy for me to eiprefs how it mov'd
me to fee what Ecftafy and filial Affedion had
work'd in this poor Savage, at the Sight of his Fa-
ther, and of his being deliver'd from Death ; ncr
indeed can I defcribe half the Extravagancies of his
Affection after this ; for he went into the Boat and
out of the Boat a great many Times : When he
went in to him, he would fit down by him, open
his Breaft, and hold his Father's Head clofe to his
Bofom half an Hour together, to nourilh it; then
he took his Arms and Ankles, which were numb'd
and ftifF with the Binding, and chafed and rubbed
Them with his Hands ; and I perceiving what the
Cafe was, gave him fome Rum out of my Bottle
to rub them with, which did them a great deal of
Good.
This Adion put an End to our Purfuit of the
Canoe, with the other Savages, who were now
gotten almoft out of Sight ; and it was happy f°r
us that we did not; for it blew fo hard within two
Hours after, and before they could be gotten a
Quarter of their Way, and continued blowing 1°
hard all Night, and that from the North.Welt,
which was againft them, that I could not fupp°\e,
their
their Boat could live, or that they ever reach'd to
their own Coaft.
But to return to Friday, he was To bufy about
his Father, that I could not find in my Heart to
take him off for fome Time: But after I thought
he could leave him a little, I call'd him to me,
and he came jumping and laughing, and pleas'd to
the higheft txtream ; then I aik'd him, If he had
given his Father any Bread ? He fhook his Head,
and laid, None : Ugly Dog eat all up felf; fo I gave
him a Cake of Bread out of a little Pouch I carry"d
on Purpofe :, I alfo gave him a Drain for himfelf,
but he would not taile it, but carry'd it to his Fa-
ther : I had in my Pocket alfo two or three Bunch-
es of my Raifins, fo I gave him a Handful of them
for his Father. He had no (boner given his Fa-
ther thefe Raifins, but I faw him come out of the
Boat, and run away as if he had been bewitch'd,
he ran at fiich a Rate; for he was the fwifteft Fel-
low of his Foot that ever I faw ; I fay, he run at
fuch a Rate, that he was out of Sight, as it were,
in an Inftant ; and though I call'd, and hollow'd
too, after him, it was all one, away he went, and
in a Quarter of an Hour, I faw him come back a-
gain, though not fo faft as he went; and as he
came nearer, I found his Pace was flacker, becaufe
he had fomething in his Hand.
When he came up to me, I found he had been
quite Home for an earthen Jugg or Pot to bring
his Father fome frefh Water, and that he had got
two more Cakes, or Loaves of Bread : The Bread
he gave me, but the Water he carry'd to his Father:
However, as I was very thirfty too, I took a little
Sup of it. This Wat?r reviv'd his Father more
than all the Rum or Spirits I had given him 5 for
he was juft fainting with Thirft.
. i
When
When his Father had drank, I call'd to him to
know if there was any Water left ; he faid, yes;
and I bad him give it to the poor Spaniard,
who was in as much Want of it as his Father;
and I fent one of the Cakes, that -Friday brought,
to the Spaniard too, who was, indeed, very weak,
and was repofing himfelf upon a green Place, under
the Shade of a Tree, and whofe Limbs werealfo
very ftiff, and veiy much fwell'd \vith the rude
Bandage he had been ty'd with. When I faw that,
upon Friday's coining to him with the Water, he
late up and drank, and took the Bread, and began
to eat, I went to him, and gave him a Handful of
Raiflns ; he look'd up in my Face with all the To-
kens of Gratitude and Thankfulnefs that could ap-
pear in any Countenance ; but was fo weak, not-
withftanding he had fo exerted himfelf in the Fight,
that he could not fraud upon his Ft^t; he try'd to
do it two or three Times, but was really not able,
his Ankles were fo fwelFd and fo painful to him;
fo I bad him fit ftill, and caufed Friday to rub his
Ankles, arid bathe them with Rum, as he had dene
his Father's.
I obferv'd the poor affectionate Creature_every
two Minutes, or perhaps lefs, all the while he
was here, turn'd his Head about, to fee if his Fa-
ther was in the fame Place and Pofture as he Itft
hjm fitting ; and at left he found he was not to.
be feenj at which he ftarted up, and, without
fpeaking a Word, flew with that Swiftnefs to him,
that one could fcarce perceive his Feet to touch
the Ground as he went: But when he came, he
only found he had laid himfelf down to cafe his
Limbs ; fo Friday came back to.me prcfently, and
I then fpoke to the Spaniard to let Friday help
him up if he could, and lead him to the Boat, and
then he mould carry Jrim to our Dwelling, where
I would
ftrong Fellow, took the Spaniard quite up upon
his Back, and carry'd him away to the Boat, and
fet him down foftly upon the Side or Gunnel of
the Canoe, with his Feet in the Infide of it, and then
lifted him quite in, and fet him clofe to his Fa-
ther, and prefently ftepping out again, launch'd
the Boat oft] and paddled it along the Shore falter
than I could walk, though the \Vind blew pretty
hard too; fo he brought them both fafe into our
Creek, and leaving them in the Boat, runs away
to fetch the other Canoe. As he pafs'd me, I
fpoke to him, and afk'd him, whether he went,
he told me, Go fetcb more Boat -., fo away he went
like the Wind; for fare never Man or Horfe run
like him, and he had the other Canoe in the Creek
almoft as fcon as I got to it by Land ; fo he wafted
me over, and then went to help our new Guefts
but of the Boat, which he did; but they were nei-
ther of them able to walk; fo that poor Friday
knew not what to do. ,
To remedy this 1 went to work in my Thought,
and calling to Friday to bid them fit down on the
Bank while he came to me, I foon made a Kind
of Hand-Barrow to lay them on, and Friday and I
carry'd them up both together upon it between us :
But when we had got them totheOutfideofourWall
or Fortification, we were at a worfe Lofs than be-
fore ; for it was impolfible to get them over, and'
I was refolv'd not to break it down: So I fet to
Work again , and Friday and I, in about two Hours
Time, made a very handfom Tent, cover'd with
old Sails, and above that with Boughs of Trees,
being in the Space without our outward Fence,
and between that and the Grove of young Wood
which I had planted: And here we made them two
Beds of fuch Things as I had (viz.) of good Rice*
Straw,
another to cover them on each Bed.
My Ifland was now peopled, and I thought ray
felt very rich in Subjects ; and it was a merry Re-
flection which I frequently made, How like a King
I look'd. Firft of all, the whole Country was my
own mere Property ; fo that I had an undoubted
Right of Dominion. Secondly, My People were
perfectly fubjedled : I was abfolute Lord and Law-
giver ; they all ow'd their Lives to me, and were
ready to lay down their Lives (if there had been
Occafion of it) for me. It was remarkable tco, we
had but three Subjects, and they were of three

berty of Conference throughout my Dominions:
But this is by the Way.
As foon as I had fecund my two weak refcueil
Prifoners, and given them Shelter, and a Place to
•eft them upon, I began to think of making feme
'rovifion for them : And the firft Thing I did, I
>rder'd Friday to take a yearling Goat, betwixt a
(id and a Goat, out of my particular Flock, to
>e kill'd, when I cut oft the hinder Quarter, and
hopping it into fmall Pieces, I fet Friday to work
o boiling and ftewing, and made them a very
;ood Difh, I allure you, of Flefh and Broth, ha-
•ing put fome Barley and Rice alfo into the
>roth ; and as I cook'd it without Doors, (for I
lade no Fire within my inner Wall) fo I carry a
: all into the new Tent; and having fet a Table
lere for them, I fate down and eat my owrn Din-
er alfo with them, and, as well as I could, cheard
lem and encourag'd them ; Friday being my foj*
reter, efpecially to his Father, and indeed to the
to ,
Efc
gre
Sa\
Vto
SI
Spaniard too :, for the Spaniard fpoke the Language
of the Savages pretty well.
After we had dined, or rather Tupped, I order'd
Friday to take one of the Canoes,, and go and
fetch our Mufkets and other Fire- Arms, which for
Want of Time we had left upon the Place of Battle ;
and the next Day I order'd him to go and bury
the dead Bodies of the Savages, which lay open to
the Sun, and would prefently be offenfive ; .and I
alfo order'd him to bury the horrid Remains of
their ba barons Feaft, which I knew were pretty
much, and which I could not think of doing" my
felf ; nay, I could not bear to fee them, if I went
that Way : All which he punctually perform'd, and
defac'd the very Appearance of the Savages being
there ; fo that when I went again, I could fcarce
know where it was, otherwife than by the Corner
of the Wood pointing to the Place.
I then began to enter into a little Converfation
with my two new Subjects; and firft I fet Friday
to enquire of his Father, what he thought of the
Efcape of the Savages in that Canoe, and whether we
might expect a Return of them with a Power too
great for us to refift . His firft Opinion was,that the
Savages in the Boat never could live out the Storm
which blew that Night they went off, but muft of
Necelfity be drown'd or driven South to thofe other
Shores, where they were as fure to be devour'd as
they were to be drown'd if they were caft away ^
but as to what they would do if they came fafe on
Shore, he faid he knew not.; but it was his Opini-
on that they were fo dreadfully frighted with the
Manner of their being attack'd, theNoife and the
Fire, that he believ'd they would tell their People
they were all kill'd by Thunder and Lightning, not
by the Hand of Man, and that the two which
appear'd, (viz.) Friday and me, were two Heavenly
• Spirits
not Men with Weapons: This he laid he knew,
becaufe he heard them all cry out fo in their Lan.
guage to one another ; for it was impollible to them
to conceive that a Man could dart Fire, and fpeak
Thunder, and kill at ?. Diftance without lifting up
the Hand, as was done now: And this old Savage
was in the right ; for, as I uhderftood fince by
others Hands, the Savages never attempted to go fr
ver to the Ifland afterwards j they were fo terrifrd
with the Accounts given by thofe four Men, ; for it
feems they did efcape the Sea> that they believ'd
whoever went to that enchanted Ifland would te
deftroy'd with Fire from the Gods. )1,
This however I knew not, and therefore was un.
dei continual Apprehenfions for a good while, ad
kept always upon my Guard, me and all my Arfnfs
for as we were now four of us, I would have ven.
tur'd upon a hundred of them fairly in the open
Field at any Time.
In a little Time, however, no more Canoes ap;
pearing, the Fear of their Coming wore off, and
I began to take my former Thoughts of a Voyage
to the Main into Confutation, being likewife af.
lur'd by Fridays Father, that I might depend upoil
jood Ufage from their Nation on his Account, «
[ would go.
But my Thoughts were a little fufpended, when
[ had aferious Difcourfe with the Spaniard, and
vhen I underftood that there were lixteeh fflore
)f his Countrymen and Pcrtjiguefe, who having
>een caft away, and made their Efcape to tna.
iide, liv'd there at Peace indeed with the Saya.
res but were very fore put to it for Keceflanes,
nd indeed for Life: I afVd him all the Par
iculars of their Voyage, and found they were
Spanijb Ship .bound from the Riodelall«V
Ing there, which was chiefly Hides and Silver, and
to bring back what European Goods they could
meet with there; that they had five Portuguefe Sea-
men on Board, whom they took out of another
Wreck ; that five of their own Men were drowned
when the firft Ship was loft, and that thefe tfcaped
thro' infinite Dangers and Hazards, and arriv'd afc-
moft ftarv'd on the Cannibal Coaft, where they ex^
peded to have been devour'd every Moment.
He told me, they had fome Arms with them^
but they were perfedly 'ufelefs for that they had
neither Powder or Ball, the Warning of the Sea
having fpoil'd all their Powder, but a little/ which
they ufed at their firft Landing to provide them-
felves fome Food.
I afk'd him what he thought would become of
them there, and if they had form'd no Defign of
making any Efcape ? He faid, They had many
Confultations about it, but that having neither
Veflel, or Tools to build one, or Provifions of any
Kind, their Counfels always ended in Tears and
Defpair'.
I aflk'd him how he thought they would receive
a Propofal from me, which might tend towards an
Efcape : And whether, if they were all here, it might
not be done ? I told him with Freedom, I fear'd
moftly their Treachery and ill Ufage of me, if I
put my Life in their Hands ^ for that Gratitud'e was
no inherent Virtue in the Nature of Man j nor
did Men always fquare their Dealings by the Obli-
gations they had receiv'd, fo much as they did
by the Advantages they expected. I told him, it
would be very hard, that I fhould be the Inftrum'ent
of their Deliverance, and that they mould after-
wards make me their Prifoner in New Spain, where
an Englifiman was certain to be made a Sacri-
V
brought him thither ; And that I had rather be de-
liver'd up to the Savages, and be devour'd alive,
than fall into the mercilefs Claws of thePrietts, and
be carry'd into the Tnqnijitiott. I added, That o-
therwife I was perfwaded, if they were all here,
we might, with fo many Hands, build a Bark large
enough to carry us all away, either to the Braflt
Southward, or to the Iflands or Spanijh Coaft
Northward : But that if in Requital they fhould,
when I had put Weapons into their Hands, carry
me by Force among their own People, I might be
ill ufed for my Kindnefs- to them, and make my
Cafe worfe than it was before.
He anfwer'd with a great deal of Candor and In-
genuity, That their Condition was fo miferable,
and they were fo fenfible of it, that he believed
they would abhor the Thought of ufing any Man
unkindly that mould Contribute to their Delive-
rance ; and that, if Ipleafed, he would go to them
With the old Man, and difcourfe with them about
it, and return again, and bring me their Anfwer:
That he would make Conditions with them upon
their folemn Oath, That they fliould be abfolute-
ly under my Leading, as their Commander and
Captain ; and that they mould Avear upon the Holy
Sacraments and the Gofpel, to be true to me, and
to go to fiKh Chriftian Country as that I ihould
agree to, and no other; and to be directed wholly
and abfoltitely by my Orders, 'till they were land-
ed fafely in.fuch Country as I intended-, and that
he would brim?; a Contract from them under their
Hands for that Purpofe..
Then he told me, he would firft fwear to me
himfelf, That he would never ftiffrom me as long
as he liv'd, 'till I gnve him Orders; and that he
would take my Side to the. laft Drop.of his Blood*
if
2f there mould happen the leaft Breach of Faith a-
'tnon'g his Countrymen.
He told me, they were all of them very civil
honeft Men, and they were under the greateft Di-
ftrefs imaginable, having neither Weapons or
Cloaths, nor any Food, but at the Mercy and Di-
fcretion of the Savages; out of all Hopes of ever
returning to their own Country ; and that he was
fure, if I would undertake their Relief, they
Would live and die by me.
Upon thefe Aflurances, I refolv'd to venture to
relieve them, if poilible, and to fend the old Savage
and this Spaniard over to them to treat : But when
we had gotten all Things in a Readinefs to go, the
Spaniard himfelf ftarted an Objedtiow, which had
fb much Prudence in it on one hand, and fo much
Sincerity on the other hand, that I could not but
be very well fatisfy'd in it ; and, by his Advice, put
off the Deliverance of his Comrades for at leaft half
a Year. The Cafe was thus:
He had been with us now about a Month ; du-
ring which Time, I had let him fee in what Man-
ner I had provided, with the Ailiftance of Provi-
dence, for my Support; and he faw evidently what
Stock of Corn and Rice I had laid up^ which, as
it was more than fufficient for my felf, fo it was
hot fufficient, at leaft without good Hufbandry,
For my Family, now it was encreas'd to Number
Four : But much lefs would it be fufficient, if
his Countrymen, who were, as he faid, fourteen
ftill alive, ftiould come over. And leaft of all
would it be fufficient to vittual our VefTel, if we
ftiould build one, for a-Voyage to^ny of the Chri-
ftian Colonies of Ametica. So he told me, he thought
it would be mcire advifable, to let him and the
two other dig and cultivate fome more Land, as
much as I could fpare Seed to fow -, and that we
U 2 fliould
a Supply of Corn for his Countrymen when they
ihould come; for Want might be a Temptation to
them to difagree, or not to think themfelves deli-
vered, otherwife than cut of one Difficulty into
another. You know, fays he, the Children of//.
rael, though they rejoyc'd at firft for their being
deliver'd out of Egypt, yet rebel I'd even againlt God
himfelf that deliver'd them, when they came to
want Bread in the Wildernefs.
His Caution was fo feafonable, and his Advice
fogood, that I could not but be very well pleafed
with his Propofal, as well as I was fatisfy'd with
his Fidelity. So we fell to digging all four of us,
as well as the wooden Tools we were iurnifh'd
xvith permitted; and in about a Month's Time,by
the End of which it was Seed-time, we had got-
ten as mnch Land cur'd and triinuVd up,as we fow-
ed 22 Bufhels of Barley on, and 16 Jarrs of Rice, ]
which was, in {hort, all the Seed we had tofpare .t J
nor indeed did we leave our felves Barley fufficient ^
for cur own Food, for the fix Months that we had ]
to expect our Crop, that is to fay, reckoning from ]
the Time we fet our Seed afide for fowing; for it j
is not to be fuppofed it is fix Months in the Ground
in the Country.
Having now Society enough, and our Number
bdrig fufficient to put us out of Fear of the Sa-
vages, if they had come, unlefs their Number had
be'en very great, we went freely all over the Ifland,
where-ever we found Oceafion j and as here we had
nnr Efcane or Deliverance upon our Thoughts, it
was impoiiible, at leajl for me, to have the
Means of it out of mine -? to this Purpofe,
I mark'd out feveral Trees which I thought fit for
pur,Work, arid I fet Friday and his Father to cut-
ting them down.; and then I caufed the Spaniard
to overfee and direct their Work. I mew'd them
with what indefatigable Pains I had hewed a large
Tree into fingle Planks, and I caufed them to do
the like, 'till they had made about a Dozen large
Planks of good Oak, near two Foot bread, 3 > Foot
long, and from 2 Inches to 4 Inches thick : \Vhat
prodigious Labour it took up, any one may ima-
gine.
At the fame Time I contriv'd to increafe my lit-
tle Flock of tame Goats as much as I could j and
to this Purpofe, I made Friday and the Spaniard go
out one Day, and myfelf with Friday the nest
Day, for we took our Turns; and by this Means
we got above 20 young Kids to breed up with the
reft; for whenever we fhot the Dam, we faved
the Kids, and added them to our Flock: But above
all, the Seafon for curing the Grapes coming on,.
I caufed fuch a, prodigious Quantity to be hung up
in the Sun, that I believe, had we been at Alicdnt,
where the Raifins of the Sun are cur'd, we could
have fill'd 60 or 80 Barrels ; and thefe, with our
Bread, was a great Part of our Food, and very good
living too, I allure you; for it is an exceeding nou-
rifhing Food.
It was noxv Harveft, and our Crop in good Or-
der ; it was not the moft plentiful Increafe I had,
feen in the Ifland, but, however, it w* enough t?
anfwer our End; for from our 22 Bulhels of Bar-
ley, we brought in and thrafhed out above 220
Bulhels ; and the like in Proportion of. the Rice,
which was Store enough for our Food to the next
Harveft, tho' all the 16 Spaniards had been on ^hore
with me ; or if we had been ready for a Vo}>.age,
it would very plentifully have victualled our Ship,
to have carry'd us to any Part of the World, that
is to fay, of America.
U 3 Whea
\Vhen we had thus hofis'd and fecurM our Ma-
gazine ot Corn, we tell to work to make more
Wicker 'V'ork, viz. great Bafkets in which we kept
it j and rhe Spaniard was very handy and dexterous
at this Part, and often blam'd me that I did not
make fome Things tor Defence, of this Kind of
Work i but I faw no Need of it
And now having a full Supply of Food for all
the Guefts I expected, I gave the Spaniard Leave
to go over to the Main, to fee what he could do
with thofe he had left behind him there. I gave
him a ftridl Charge in Writing, not to bring any
Man with him, who would not firft fvvear in the
Prefence of himfelf and of the old Savage, That
he would no Way injure, fight with, or attark the
Perfon he mould find in the Ifland, who was fo
kind to fend for them in order to their Delive-
rance ; but that they would ftand by and defend
him sgainft all fuch Attempts, and where-ever
they went, would be entirely under and fubjeded
to his Commands ; and that this mould be put in
Writing, and fign'd with their Hands: How we
were to have this done, when I knew they had
neither Pen or Ink, that, indeed, was a Queftion
which we never alk'd.
Under thefe Inftrudtions, the Spaniard, and the
old Savage fthe Father of Friday) went away in one
of the Canoe!, which they might be faid to come
in, or rather were brought in, when they came as
Prifoners to be devour'd by the Savages.
I gave each of them a Mufket with a Firelock
on it, and about. eight Charges of Powder ana
Ball, charging them tp be very good Huftands of
both, and not to ufe either of them but upon ur•
gent Occafion. .
This was a chearful Work, being the firft Mea-
fures ufed by me in View of my Deliverance for
now
now 27 Years and fome Days. I gave them Provi-
fions of Bread, and of dry Grapes, fufficient for
themfelves for many Days, and fufficient for all
their Country-men for about eight Days Time; and
wifhing them a good Voyage, I fee them go, a-
greeing with them about a Signal they Ihould hang
out at their Return, by which I fhoukl know them
again, when they came back, at a Dilhmce, before
Jhey came on Shore.
They went away with a fair Gale on the Day
that.the Moon was at Full; by my Account in the
Month of Offober ; but as for an exatt Reckoning
of Days, after I had once loft it, J could never re-
cover it again ; nor had I kept even the Number of
Years fo punctually, as to be fure that I was right,
tho', as it prov'd, when I afterwards examin'd my Ac-
count, I found I had kept a true Reckoning of Yejrs.
It was no lefs than eight Days I had waited for
them, when a Strange and unforefeen Accident in-
terven'd, of which the like has not, perhaps, been
heard of in Hiftory. I was faft afleep in my Hutch
one Morning, when my Man Friday came running
in to me, and call'd aloud, Mafter, Mafter, they
are come, they are come.
I jump'd up, and, regardlefs of Danger, I went
out as fbon as I could get my Cloaths on, thro'
my little Grove, which (by the Way) was by this
Time grown to be a very thick Wood : I fay, re-
gardlefs of Danger, I went without my Arms,
Which was not my Cuftom to do ; but I was fur-
priz'd, when turning my Eyes to the Sea, I pre-
femly faw a Boat at about a League and Half's Di-
ftance, ftanding in for the Shore, with a Shoulder of
Mutton Sail, as they call it, and the Wind blow-
ing pretty fair to bring them in ; alfo I obferv'd
prefently, that they did not come from that Side
which the Shore lay on, but from the Souther-
U 4 rnoft
in, and bid him lie clofe, tor theft were not the
People we look'd for, and that we might not know
yet whether they were Friends or Enemies.
In the next Place, I went in to fetch my Per-
fpedive Glafs, to fee what I could make of them;
and having taken the Ladder out, I climb'dupto
the Top of the Hill, as I ufed to do when I was
apprehenfive of anything, and to take my View
the plainer without being difcover'd.
I had fcarce fet my Foot on the Hill, when ray
Eye plainly difcover'd a Ship lying at an Anchor,
at about two Leagues and a Half's Diftance from
me South.fouth-eaft, but not above a League and
gn Half from the Shore. By my Obfervation it ap-
pear'd plainly to be an Eugli/h Ship, and the Boat
appear'd to be an Englijb Long-Boat.
I cannot exprefs the Confufion I was in, tho' the
Joy of feeing a Ship, and one who I had Reafon to
elieve was mann'd by my own Country.men, and
confequently Friends, was fuch as I cannot defcribe;
but yet I had fome fecret Doubts hung about me,
I cannot tell from whence they came, bidding me
keep upon my Guard. In the firft Place, it oc.
Curr'd to me to confider what Bufinefs an Ev$f>
Ship could have in f hat Part of the World, lince
it was not the Way to or from any Part of the
World where the Evglijl) had any Traffick ; and
I knew there had been no Storms to drive them
in there, as in Diftrefs; and that if they were Eng-
llft) really, it was moft probable that they were
here upon no good DefTgn ; and that I had better
continue as I was, than fall into the Hands of
. . Thieves and Murderers.
Let no Man defpife the fecret Hints and Notices
of Danger which fometimes are given him,
f, \vhen he may think there is no. Poifibility of its
being
being real. That fuch Hints and Notices are given
us, I believe few that have made any Obfervations
of Things can deny ^ that they are certain Dif-
coveries of an invifible World, and a Converfe of
Spirits, we cannot doubt, and if the Tendency
of them feems to be to warn us of Danger, why
ihould we not fuppofe they are from fome friendly
Agent, whether fupreme, or inferior and fubordi-
nate, is not the Queftion; and that they are given
for our Good ?
The prefent Queftion abundantly confirms me in
the Juftice of this Reafoning ^ for had I not been
made cautious by this iecret Admonition, come it
from whence it will, I had been undone inevitably,
and in a far worfe Condition than before, as you
will fee prefently.
I had not kept myfelf long in this Pofture, but
I faw the Boat draw near the Shore, as if they
look'd for a Creek to thruft in at for the Conveni-
ence of Landing: However, as they did not come
quite far enough, they did not fee the little Inlet
where I formerly landed my Rafts, but ran their
Boat on Shore upon the Beach, at about half a
Mile from me, which was very happy for me; for
otherwife, they would have landed juft (as I may
fay) at my Door, and would foon have beaten me
out of my Caftle, and perhaps have plunder'd me
of all I had.
, When they were on Shore, I was fully fetisfy'd
that they were Englishmen, at leaft, moft of them;
one or two I thought were Dittcb ; but it did not
prove fo: There were in all eleven Men, whereof
three of them I found were unarm'd, and, as I
thought, bound ; and when the firft four or five of
them were jump'd on Shore, they took thofe three
out of the Boat as Prifoners : One of the three I
: could perceive ufing the moft paflionate Geftures of
Entreaty,
Jnjreaty, Affliction and Defpair, even to a kind of
Extravagance ; the other two, 1 could perceive,
lifted up their Hands foaoeturies, and appeanlcon.
cern'd indeed, but not to" fuch a Degree as" the
firft.
I was perfectly confounded at the Sight, and
knew not what the Meaning of it mould be. fit
day call'd out to me in Eugli/f), as well as he could,
0 Mafter ! Ton fee Kngliih Mam eat Prifoner as wJ
as Savage Mans. "Why, fa^s I, Friday, do you
think they are a going to eat them then ? 2«,%s
Friday, 1 hey will eat tbetn: No, no, fays I, Frfyi
1 am afraid they will murder them, indeed, but
you may be fure they will not eat them.
All this while I had no Thought of wjiat the
Matter really was \ but' ftood trembling with the
Horror of the Sight, expecting every Moment when
the three Prifoners fhould be kill'd ; nay, oncel faw
one of the Villains lift up his Arm with a great Cut-
lam, (as the Seamen call it) or Sword, to ftrikeone
of the poor Men ; and I expected to fee him fall
every Moment, at which all the Blood in my Body
jfeem d to run chill in my Veins.
I wim'd heartily now for my Spaniard, and the
Savsge that was gone with him ^ or that I h»d»:
ny Way to have come undifcover'd within Snot ol
them, that I might have refcu'd the three Men i
for I faw no Fire- Arms they had among them; but
it fell out to my Mind another Way.
After I had obferv'd theoutragiousUfageof tw
:hree Men by the infolent Seamen, I obfervd the
Fellows run fcattering about the Land, as if they
wanted to fee the Country : I obfervd that the
:hree other Men had Liberty to go alfo where they
)leas?d; but they "fate down all three upon tje
rround very penfive, and look'd like Men •»

W]
came on Shore, and began to look about me 5 how
I gave my felt" over for loft, how wildly I look'd
round me, what dreadful Apprenfions I had, an4
how I lodg'd in the Tree all Night for fear of
being devour'd by-wild Beafts.
As I knew nothing that Night of the Supply I
was to receive by the providential Driviug 'of the
Ship nearer the Land, by the Storms and Tide, by
which I have fince been fo long nouriih'd and fup-
ported; fo thefe three poor defolate Men knew no-
thing how certain of Deliverance, and Supply they
were, how near it was to them, and how effedu-
ally and ready they were in a Condition of Safety,
at the fame Time that they thought themfelves loft,
and their Cafe defperate.
So little do we fee before us in the World, and
fb much Reafon have we to depend chearfully upon
the great Maker of the World, that he does not
leave his Creatures fo abfolutely deftitute, but that
in the worft Circumftances they have always fome-
thing to be thankful for, and fornetimes are nearer
their Deliverance than they imagine; nay, are even
brought to their Deliverance by the Means by
which they feem to be brought to their Deftru-
ction.
It was juft at the Top of High-Water when thefe
People came on Shore, and while partly they ftood
parly ing with the Prisoners they brought, and part-
ly while they rambled about to fee what kind of a
Place they were in, they had carelefly ftaid till the
Tide was fpent, and the Water-wasebb'd confidera-
bly away, leaving their Boat a-ground.
They had left two Men in the Boat, who as I
found afterwards, having drank a little too much
Brandy, fell a-fleep ; however, one of them waking
fooner than the other, and finding the Boat too faft
:«:«,; : . ;: . 3-grOUnd

a-ground for him to ftir it, hollow'd for the reft wljo
were ftraggling about, upon which they all foon
came to the Boat ^ but it was paft all their Strength
to launch her, the Boat being very heavy, and the
Shore on that Side being a foft oufy Sand, almoft
like a Quick-Sand.
In this Condition, like true Seamen, who are per-
haps the leaft «f all Mankind given to Fore thought,
they gave it over, and away they ftroll'd about the
Country again ; and I heard one of them fay aloud
to another, calling them off from the Boat, Vb),lit
tier alone, Jack, can't ye, fie will float next Tide; by
which I was fully confirm'd in the main Enquiry,
of what Countrymen they were.
All this while I kept my felf very clofe, not once
daring to ftir out of my Caftle, any farther than to
my Place of Obfervation near the Top of the Hill;,
and very glad I was, to think how well it wasforti.
{yd : I knew it was no lefs than ten Hours before
the Boat could be on float again, and by that Time
it would be dark, and I might be at more Liberty ^
to fee their Motions, and to hear their Difcourfe, if'
they had any. 3
In the mean time, I fitted my felf up for a Bat. whe
tel as before, though with more Caution, knowing reft]
I had to do with another kind of Enemy than I had pav
Sit firft. I order'd Friday alfo, who I had made an to %'
excellent Markfman with his Gun, to load him. All
felf with Arms : I took my felf two Fowling-Pieces, yQu
and I gave him three Mufkets; my Figure indeed foi
was very fierce; I had my formidable Goat.Skin 1 fs
Coat on, with the great Cap I have mention d, a to
naked Sword by my Side, two Piftols in my Belt,
and a Gun upon each Shoulder.
It was my Defign, as I faid above, not to have
made any Attempt till it was dark : But about
Two a Clock, being the Heat of the. Day, I found ietl

that in fhort they were all gone {haggling into the
Woods, and, as I thought, were laid down to Sleep.
The three poor diftrefled Men, too anxious for their
Condition to get any Sleep', were, however, fet
down under the Shelter of a great Tree, at about
a quarter of a Mile from me, and, as I thought, out
of Sight of any of the reft.
Upon this I refolv'd to difcover my felf to them,
and learn fomething of their Condition : Immedi-
ately I march'd in the Figure as above, my Man
Fi iday at a good Diftance behind me, as formidable
for his Arms as I, but not maki£ quite fo flaring
a Spettre-like Figure as I did. *^
I came as near them undifcover'd as I could,
and then before any of them faw me, I call'd aloud
to them in Spani/i, What are ye Gentlemen ?
They ftarted up at the Noife, but were ten
times more confounded when they faw me, and
the uncouth Figure that I made. They made no
Anfwer at all; but I thought I perceiv'd them juft
going to fly from me, when I fpoke to them in
Eitglijh : Gentlemen, faid I, do not be furpriz'd at
me ; perhaps you may have a Friend near you
when you did not expect it. He muft be fent di-
rectly from Heaven then, faid ove of them very
gravely to me, and pulling (f bis Hat at the fame Time
to me, for our Condition is paft the help of Man.
All Help is from Heaven, Sir, faid I. But can
you put a Stranger in the Way how to Help you,
for you feem to me to be in fome great Diftrefs ?
I faw you when you landed, and when youfeem'd
to make Application to the Brutes that came with
you, I faw one of them lift up his Sword to kill
you.
The poor Man, with Tears running down his
Face, and trembling, looking like one aftonim'd,
return'd, Am I talking to God, or Man! h It a teal
Man
Man, or an Augel! Be in no fear about that, Sir,
faid I, if God had fent an Angel to relieve you, he
would have come better cloath'd, and arm'd after
another Manner than you fee me in ^ pray layalide
your Fears, I am a Man, an ErgliJInnan, and dif.
pos'd to aflift you, you fee; I have one Servant
only; we have Arms and Ammunition ; tell us
freely, Can we ferve you ? What is your
Cafe ;
Our Cafe, faid he, Sir, is too long to tell you,
while our Murderers are fo near j but, in ihorf,
Sir, I was Corri^nder of that Ship, my Men
have mutiny'd agwift me $ they have been hard-
ly prevail'd on not to murder me, and at laft
have fet me on Shore in this defolate Place, with
thefe two Men with me, one my Mate, theothel
a PafTenger, where we expected to perifh, believ-
ing the Place to be uninhabited, and know not yet
what to think of it.
Where are thofe Brutes, your Enemies, faid'.
do you know where they are gone ? There tkyty,
Sir, faid he, pointing to a Thicket of Trees, *J
Heart trembles for fear they have feen us, aid few
itott fpeak 5 if they have, bey will certainly murler si
all. . >.
Have they any Fire.Arms, faid I? He anfwerd,
they had only two Pieces, and one which thev
left in the Boat. Well then, faid I,»leave the reft
to me ; I fee they are all afleep, it is an ealy
thing to kill them all; but mall we rather take
them Priloners? He told me, there were two de.
fpdrate Villains among them that it was fcar«
fafe to fhew any Mercy to 5 but if they were ie.
cur'd, he believ'd all the reft would return to
their Duty. I aiFd him, which they were ? W
told me, he could not at that Diftance defer*
them j but he would obey my Orders in any thin?

I would direcT: Well, fays I, let us retreat out of
their View or Hearing, leaft they awake, and we
will refolve farther ; fo they willingly went back
with me, till the Woods cover'd us from them.
Look you, Sir, feid I, if I venture upon your
Deliverance, are you willing to make two Condi-
tions with me j he anticipated my Propofals, by
telling me, that both he and the Ship, if recover'd,
fhould be wholly directed and commanded by me
in every thing ; and if the Ship was not recover'd,
he would live and die with me in what Part of the
World foever I would lend him; and the two other
Men faid the fame.
7lrell, fays I, my Condition are but two. i. That
while you flay on this Ifland with me, you will not
pretend to any Authority here; and if I put Arms
into your Hands, you will upon all Occafions give
them up to me, and do no Prejudice to me or mine,
upon this Ifland, and in the mean time be govern'd
by my Orders.
2. That if the Ship is, or may be tecover'd,
you will carry me and my Man to Evgland Paf-
fage-free.
He gave me all the Aflurances that the Invention
and Faith of Man could devife, that he would com-
ply with thefe mod reafonable Demands, and be-
fides would owe his Life to me, and acknowledge
it upon all Occafions as long as he liv'd.
Well then, faid J, he-re are three Mufkets for
you, with Powder and Ball; tell me next what you
think is proper to be done. He ftiewed all the
Teftimony of his Gratitude that he was able ;
but offer'd to be wholly guided by me. I told him,
I thought it was hard venturing any Thing j But
the beft Method I could think of was to fire upon
them at once, as they lay ; and if any was not
kiird at the firft Volley, and offered to fubmit.
we might fave them, and fo put it wholly upon
God s Providence to dirett the Shot.
He faid very modeftly, That he was loath to
kill them, if he could help it }. but that thofetwo
were incorrigible Villains, and had been the Au-
thors of all the Mutiny in the Ship, and if they
efcaped, we fhould be undone ftill; for they would
go on Board, and bring the whole Ship's Com-
pany, and deftroy us all. Well then, fays I, &•
ce/tty legitimates my Advice ; for it is the ml)
Jfay to fave our Lives. However, feeing him ftill
cautious of (bedding Blood, I told him they fhould
gc themfelves, and manage as they found con-
venient.
In the Middle of this Difcourfe, we heard fome
of them awake, and foon after we faw two of
them on their Feet. I afk'd him, if either of them
were the Men who he had faid were the Heads
of the Mutiny? He faid, No: Well then, faid I,
you may tlet them efcape, and Providence feems to
have waken'd them on Purpofe to fave themfelves.
Now, fays I, if the reft efcape you, it is your
Fault.
Animated with this, he took the Mufket I
had given him in his Hand, and a Piftol ia
bis Belt, and his two Comrades with him, with
;ach Man a Piece in his Hand. The two Men
,vho were with him going firft, made feme
Sfoife, at which one of the Seamen, who was
twake, turn'd about, and feeing them coming,
ry'd out to the reft; but it was too late then; fo*
he Moment he cry'd out, they fir'd ; I mean the too
Wen, the Captain wifely referving his own Piece:
?hey had fo well aim'd their Shot at the Men they
new, that one of them was kill'don the Spot, and
be other very much wounded; but not being dead,
e ftarted up upon his Feet, and call'd eagerly for
help,
help to the other} but the Captain flapping tohim^
told him, 'twas too late to cry for help, hefhould
call upon God to forgive his villany,and with that
Word knock'd him down with the Stock of his
Musket, fo that he never fpoke more: There were
three more in the Company, and one of them was
alfo (lightly wounded : By this Time I was come,
and when they faw their Danger, and that it was
in vain to refift, they begg'd for Mercy: The Cap-
tain told them he would fpare their Lives, if they
would give him any Aflurance of their Abhorrence
of the Treachery they had been guilty of, and would
fwear to be faithful to him in recovering the Ship,
and afterwards in carrying her back to Jamaica,
from whence they came: They gave him all the
Proteftations of their Sincerity that could be deur'd,
and he5 was willing to believe them, and fpare their
Lives, which I was not againft } only I oblig'd him
to keep them bound Hand and Foot while they were
upon the liland. ,
While this was doing, I. fent Friday with the
Captain's Mate to the Boat, with Orders to fecure
her, and bring away the Oars, and Sail, which
they did; and by and by, three ttraggling Men that
were (happily for them) parted from the reft, came
back upon heaving the Guns fir.'fc, and feeing their
Captain, who before was their Prifoner, now their
Conqueror, they fubmitted to be bound alfo; and
fo our Victory was compleat.
It now remain'd, that the Captain and I fhould
enquire into one another's Circumftances: I began
firll, and told him my whole Hiftory, which he
heard with an Attention even to Amazement; and
particularly, at the wonderful Manner of my being
furnifh'd with Provilions and Ammunition; and
indeed, as my Story is a whole Collection of Won-
ders, it affected him deeply -, but when he reflected
-' X from
iave been, prtferv'd there, on purpofe to fave his
Jfe, the Tears ran down his Face, and he could
iot {peak a Word more.
After this Communication was at an End, I carty'd
lim and his two Men into my Apartment, lead-
n<* them in, jutr. where I came out, viz. at the
Pop of the Houfe, where I refrefh'd them with
iich Provifiohs as I had, and fliew'd them all the
Contrivances I h.id made, during my long, long,
inhabiting that Place.
All I fhew'd them, all I faid to them, was per-
I'ctly amazing} but above all, the Captain admir'd
ny Fortification, and how perfectly I had conceal'd
my Retreat with a Grove of Trees, which having
l)een now planted near twenty Years, and the Trees
growing much fatter than in England, was become
a little Wood, and fo thick, that it was unpaflable
in any Part of it, but at that one Sid?, where I
had 'referv'd my little winding Pafliige into it: I
told him, this was my Caltle, and my Refidence;
but that I had a Seat in the Country, as molt Prin-
ces have, whither I could retreat upon Occafion,
and I would fhew him that too another Time;
but at prefent, c»r Bufmtfs was to confider how
to recover the Ship: He agreed with meas to thaf,
but told rne, he was perfectly at a Lofs what Mea-
iiires to take; for that there were ftill fix and twenty
Hands on board, who having em red into a curled
Confpiracy, by which they had all forfeited their
Lives to the Law, would be harden'd in it now by
Delperationj and would carry it on, knowing that
if they were reduc'd, they fhould be brought to the
Gallows, as foon as they came to England, or to
any of the Englijh Colonies } and that therefore
there would be no attacking them .with fo lmalla
Number as we were. * *• • ,j
I mus'd for Come Time upon what he had faid,
and found it was a very rational Conclusion; and
that therefore fomething was to be refolv'd on ve-
ry fpeedily, as well to draw the Men on board in-
to fome Snare for their Surprize, as to prevent their
Landing upon us, and destroying usj upon this it
prefently occurr'd to me, that in a little while the
Ship's Crew wondring what was become of their
Comrades, and of the Boar, would certainly come
on Shore in their other Boat, to fee for them, and
that then perhaps they might come arm'd, and be
too ftrong for us; this he allow'd was rational.
Upon this, I told him the firft Thing we had to
do, was to Have the Boat, which lay upon the
Beach, fo that they might not carry her off} and
taking every Thing out of her, leave her fo far ufelefs
as not to b,e fit to fwim; accordingly we went on
board, took the Arms which were left on board,
out of her, and whatever elfe we found there,
which was a Bottle of Brandy, and another of
Rum, a few Bisket Cakes, a Horn of Powder, and
a great Lump of Sugar, in a Piece of Canvas } the
Sugar was five or fix Pounds } all which was ve-
ry welcome to me, efpecially the Brandy and
Sugar, of which I had had none left for many
Years.
When we had carry'd all thefe Things on Shore
(the Oars, Malt, Sail, and Rudder of the Boat,
were carry'd away before, as above) we knock'd a
great Hole in her Bottom, that if they had come
ftrong enough to mafter us, yet they could not car-
ry off the Boat.
Indeed, it was not much in my Thoughts, that
we could be able to recover the Ship; but my View
was that if they went away without the Boat, I did
not much quettion to make her fit again, to carry us
away to the Leeward Iflands, and call upon our
X z Friends
Friends, the Spaniards^ in my way, for I had them
Hill in my Thoughts.
While we were thus preparing our Defigns, and
had firft, by main Strength, heav'd the Boat up up-
on the Beach, fo high that the Tide would not
fleet her off at High-Water-JVIavk; and befides,
had broke a hole in her Bottom, too big to be
quickly ftopp'd, and were fat down mufing what
we fhould doj we heard the Ship fire a Gun, and
faw her make a Waft with her Antient, as a Signal
for the Boat to come on Board } but no Boat ftirr'd;
and they fir'd feveral times, making other Signals
for the Boat.
• At laft, when all their Signals and Firings prov'd
fruitlels, and they found the Boat did not ftir, we
faw them by the help of my Glaffcs, hoift another
Boat out, and row towards the Shore 3 and we
found as they approach'd, that there was no lefs
than ten Men in her, and that they had Fire-Arms
with them.
As the Ship lay almoft two Leagues from the
Shore, we had a full view of them as they came,
and a plain fight of the Men, even of their Faces,
bccaufe the Tide having fct them a little to theEajl
of the other Boat, they row'd up under Shore, to
come to the fame Place, where the other had land-
ed, and where the Boat lay.
By this means, I fay, we had a full view of them,
and the Captain knew the Perfons and Characters
of all the Men in the Boat, of whom he faid, that
there were three very honeft Fellows, who he\vas
fure were led into thisConfpiracy by thereil, being
over-power'd and high ted.
But that as for the Boatfwain, who it feem was
the chief Officer among them, and all the reft, they
were as outragious as any of the Ship's Crew, ana
were no doubt made def perate in their new Enter-
prize,
prize, and terribly apprehenfive he was, that they
would be too powerful for us.
I fmil'd at him, and told him, that Men,in our
Circumftances were pan1 the Operation of Fear :
That feeing almoft every Condition that could be
\vas better than that which we werefuppos'd to be
in, we ought to expect that theConfequence, whe-
ther Death or Life, would be fure to be a Deli-
verance: I ask'd him, What he thought of the Cir-
cumftances of my Life? And, whether a Delive-
rance were not worth venturing for? And where,
Sir, faid I, is your Belief of my being preferv'd here
on purpofe to fave your Life, which elevated you
a little while ago? For my Parr, {aid I, there feetns
to be but one Thing amifsinall the Profpect of it;
Chat's that? Says he} why, faid I, 'Tis, that as you
fay, there are three or four honett Fellows among
them, which fhould be fpar'd } had they been all of
the wicked Part of the Crew, I fhould have thought
God's Providence had fingled them out to deliver
them into your Hands } for depend upon it, every
Man of them that comes a-fhore are our own, and
fhall die, or live, as they behave to us.
As 1 (poke this with a rais'd Voice and chearful
Countenance, I found it greatly encourag'd him } fo
we fet vigorously to our Bufinefs : We had upon the
firil Appearance of the Boat's coming from the Sh:p,
confider'd of feparating our Prifoners, and had in-
deed feciir'd them effectually.
, Two of them, of whom the Captain was lefs af-
fur'd than ordinary, I fent with Friday^ and one of
the three (dellver'd Men) to my Cave, where they
were remote enough, and out of Danger of being
heard or difcover'd, or of finding their way out of.
the Woods, if they could havedeliver'd themfelves:
Here they left them bound, but gave them Provifi-
and promis'd them if they continued there qui-
' X $ etly,
but that if they attempted their Efcape, theyfhould
'be put to Death without Mercy: They promis'd
faithfully to bear their Confinement with Patience,
and were very thankful that they had fuch good
Ufage, astohaveProvifions, and a Light leftthem;
for Friday gave them Candles (fuch as we made our
felves) for their Comfort; arid they did not know
but that he flood Sentinel over them at the En-
trance.
The other Prifoners had better Ufage; two of
them were kept pinion'd indeed, becaufe the Cap-
tain was not free to truft (hem; but the other two
were taken into my Service upon their Captain'sRe-
commendation, and upon their folemnly engaging
to live and die with us; fo with them and the three
honcft Men, we were feven Men, well arm'd; and
I made no doubt we fhou'd be able to deal well e-
nough with the Ten that were a coming, confi-
de' ing that the Captain had faid, there were three
or four honeft Men among them nlfo.
As foon as they got to the Place where their o-
ther Boat lay, they run their Boat in to the Beach,
and came all on Shore, hailing the Boat up after
them, which I was glad to fee ; for I was afraid
they would rather have left the Boat at an Anchor,
fome Diftance from the Shore, with fome Hands
in her, to guard her; and fo we fhould not be able
to feize the Boat.
Being on Shore, the firft Thing they did, they
ran all to their other Boar, and it was eafy to fee
that they were under a great Surprize, to find her
ftripp'd as above, of all that was in her, and a great
hole in her Bottom.
After they had mus'd a while upon this, they |
fet up two or three great Shouts, hollowing with |
all their might, to try if they could make their
Companions
Companions hear; but all was to no purpofe: Then
they came all clofe in a Ring, and fir'd.a Volley of
their fmall Arms, which indeed we heard, and the
Echoes made the Woods ring} but it was all one,
thofe in the Cave we were fure could not hear, and
thofe in our keeping, though they heard it well
enough, yet durft give no Anfwer to them.
They were fo aftonifh'd at the Surpri7e of this,
that as they told us afterwards, they refolv'd to gb
all on board again to their Ship, and let them know
there, that the Men were all murther'd, and the
Long-Boat ftav'd; accordingly they immediately
launch'd their Boat again, and gat all of them on
board.
The Captain was terribly amaz'd, and even con-
founded at this, bdieving they would go onboard
the Ship again, and fet Sail, giving their Comrades
for loft, and fo he fhould ftill lofe the Ship, which
he was in hopes we fhould have recover'd ; but he
was quickly as much frighted the other way.
They had not been long put off" with the Boat,
but we perceiv'd them all coming on Shore again;
b. ut with this new Meafure in their Conduct, which
• it feems they confulted together upon, viz. To
leave three Men in the Boat, and the reft to go on
Shore, and go up into the Country to look for their
Fellows.
This was a great Dfappointment to us; for now
we were at a Lofs what to do; for our feizing
thofe feven Men on Shore would be no Advantage
to us, if we let the Boat efcape; becaufe they
would then row away to the Ship, and then the
reft of them would be fure to weigh and fet Sail,
and fo our recovering the Ship would be lolt,
However, we had no Remedy, but to wait and
fee what the Iflue of Things might prefent; the
fe.ven Men came on Shore, and the three who rc-
. X 4 maio'd
maitfdin the Boat, put her off to a good Diftance
from the Shore, and came to an Anchor to wait for
tnemj fo that it was impoffible for us to come at
them in the Boat.
Thofe that came on fhore, kept clofe together,
"Tu "g towards the Top of the little Hill, under
which my Habitation lay } and we could fee them
plainly, though they could not perceive us: We
could have been very glad they would have come
nearer to us, fo that we might have fir'd at them,
'••' that they would have gone farther off, that we
might have come abroad.
But when they were come to the Brow of the
"il, where they could fee a great way into the
Valley.sand Woods, which lay towards ihcNertb-
y parr, and where the Ifland lay loweft, they
inouted, and hollow'd till they were weary; and
not caring it feems to venture far from the Shore,
nor far from one another, they fat down together
under a Tree, to confider of it: Had they thought
tit to have gone to fleep there, as the other Party
or them had done, they had done the Jobb for us;
but they were too full of Apprehenfions of Danger,
to venture to go to fleep, tho' they could not tell
What the Danger was they had to fear neither.
The Captain made a very juft Propofal to me,
upon this Confutation of theirs, viz. That per-
haps they would all fire a Volley again, to endea-
vour to make their Fellows hear, and that we
Ihpujd all felly upon them, juft'at the Jundure
when their Pieces were all difcharg'd, and they
Would cci raii;ly yield, and we fliould have them
without Blood-lhed: I lik'd the Propofal, provided
it was done \vlule we were near enough to come
up to them, before they could load their Pieces
again.,
'- But
a long Time, very inetbUite what Courfe to take;
at length I told them, there would be nothing to
be done in my Opinion till Night, and then if they
did not return to the Boat, perhaps we might find
a way to get between them and the Shore, and fo
might ufe fome Stratagem with them in the Boat
to get them on Shove.
We waited a great while, though very impatient
for their removing j and were very uneafy, when,
after long Confultations, we faw them ftart all up,
and march down toward the Sea: It feems they had
fuch dreadful Apprehenfions upon them .of the
Danger of the Place, that they refolv'd to go op
board the Ship again, give their Companions over
for loft, and fo go on with their iritended^Voyage
with the Ship.
As foon as I perceiv'd them go toward.s the Shore,
I imagin'd it to be as it really was, That they had
given over their Search, and were for going back
again j and the Captain, as foon as I rbld him my
Thoughts, was ready to fink at the Apprehenfions
of itj but I prefently thought of a Stratagem to
fetch them back again, and which anfwer'd my
End to a Tittle.
1 order'd Friday^ and the Captain's Mate, to go
over the little Creek Pi^efiward^ towards the Place
where the Savages came on Shore, when Friday was
refcu'dj and as foon as they came to a little rifing
Ground, at about half a Mile Diftance, I bad them
hollow, as loud as they could, and' wait till they
found-tbe Seamen heard them; that as foon as ever
they heard the Seamen anfwer them, they ihould
return it again, and then keeping out of Sight, take
a round, always anfwering when the other hollow'd,
to draw them as far into the Ifland, and among the
Woods,
Tie by fuch ways as I directed tliem. '
They were juft going into the Boat, when.Fr/-
iay and the Mate hollow'd, and they prefently heard
hem, and anfwering, run along the Shore fFeft-
ward, towards the Voice they heard, when they
were prefently Itopp'd by the Creek, where the
Water being up, they could not get over, nnd
rall'd for the Boat to come up, and let them over,
is indeed I ex peeled.
When they had fet themfelves over, I obferv'd,
hat the Boat being gone up a good way into the
Dretk, and as it were in a Harbour within the
Land, they took one of the three Men out of her
o go along with them, and left only two in the
Soar, having faftned her to the Stump of a little
free o.n the Shore.
This was what I wiuYd forj and immediately
caving Friday and the Captain's Mate to their Bufi-
icfs, 1 took the reft with me, and eroding the
>eck out of their Sight, we furpriz'd the two
^len before they were aware j one of them lying on
Shore, and the other being in the Boat; the Fellow
in Shore, was between deeping and waking, and go-
ng to ftart up, the Captain who wasforemoft,ranin
ipon him,and knock'd him down,and then call'dout
0 him in the Boat to yield, or he wasadead Man.
There needed very few Arguments to perfuade
fingle Man to yield, when he faw five Men upon
im, and his Comrade knock'd downj befides, this
/as it fecms one of the three who were not fo hearty
1 the Mutiny as the reft of the Crew, and there-
jre was eafily perfuaded, not only to yield, butar-
;rwards to join very fincerely with us. v
In the mean time, Friday. and the Captain's Mate
> well manag'd their" Bufinefs with the reft, that
icy drew them by hollowing and anfwering, from

ther, till they not only heartily tir'd them, but left
tliem, where they were very fure they could not
reach back to the Boat, before it was dark j and^g-
deed they were heartily tir'd.themfelves alfo.bythe
Time they, came back to us.
We had nothing now to do, but to watch for
them in the dark, and to fall upon them, Ib as to
make fure work with them.
It was feveral Hours after Friday came back to
me, before they came back to their Boat } and we
could hear the foremoll of them long before
they came quite up, calling to thofe behind to
come along, and could alfo hear them anfwer and
complain how lame and tir'd they were, and not
able to come any fafter, which was very welcome
News to us.
At length they cajne up to the Boat} but 'tis
impoflible to exprefs their Confufion, when they
found the Boat fatt a.ground in the Creek, the
Tide ebb'd out, and their two Men gone: We
could hear them call to one another in a mot t la-
mentable Manner, telling one another they were
gotten into an inchanted Ifland; that either there
were Inhabitants in it, and they fhould all be mur-.
ther'd, or clfe there were Devils and Spirits in it,
and they fhould be all carry'd away, and devour'd.
They hollow'd again, and call'd their two Com-
rades by their Names a great many times, but
no Anfwer. After fome time, we could fee
them, by the little Light there was, run about
wringing their Hands like Men in Defpairj and
that Ibmetimes they would go and fit down in the
Boat to reft themfelvos, then come afhore again,
and walk about again, and fo the fame thing over
again.
My
My Men would fain have me give them Leave
to fall upon them at once in the Dark; but I was
willing to take them at fome Advantage, fo to
fgare them, and kill as few of them as f could} Of U5
and ei'pecially I was unwilling to hazard the killing
any of our own Men, knowing the other were ve-
ry well armed. 1 refolved to wait to fee if they
did not feparatej and therefore to make lure of
them, I drew my Ambufcade nearer, and order'd fo
Friday and the Captain to creep upon their Hands to 0[,
and Feet as clofe to the Ground as they could, anfW(
that they might not be difcover'd, and get as near . ^ ^
them as they could poffibly, before they offered to
fire. '
They had not been long in that Pofture, but that
the Boatfwain, who was the principal Ringleader
of the Mutiny, and had now fhewn himfelf the a
moft dejected and difpirited of all the reft, came °
walking towards them with two more of their
Crew j the Captain was fo eager, as having this js
principal Rogue fo much in his Power, that he
could hardly have Patience to let him come fo
near, as to be fure of him j for they only heard
his Tongue before: But when they came nearer,
the Captain and Friday ttarting up on their Feet,
let fly at them.
The Boatfwain was kill'd upon the Spot, the
next Man was fhot into the Body, and fell juft by ^.
him, tho' he did not die till an Hour or two after;
md the third run for it.
At the Noiie of the Fire, I immediately ad-
;anc'd with my whole Army, which was now o
VIen, viz. my felf Generali/mo, Friday my Lieu-
:enant^General, the Captain and his two Men, and
he three Prifoners of War, who we had crufted
vith Arms.
We hls
We came upon them indeed in the Dark, fa that
they could not fee our Number; and I made the
Man we had left in the Boat, who was now one
of us, call to them by Name, to try if I could
bring them to a Parley, and fo might perhaps re-
duce them to Terms, which fell out juft as we de-
fir'd : For indeed it was eafy to think, as their
Condition then was, they would be very willing
to capitulate; fo he calls out as loud as he could,
to one of them, Tom Smith, Tom Smith; Tom Smith
anfwer'd immediately, Who's that, Robinfon? for
it feems he knew his Voice : T'other anfwer'd, Ay,
ay; for God's Sake, Tom Smith, throw down your
Arms, and yield, or, you are all dead Men this Mo-
ment.
Who muft we yield to ? inhere are they ? (fays Smith
again;) Here they are, fays he, here's our Captain,
and fifty Men with him, have been hunting you
this two Hours; the Boatfwain is kill'd, WillFrye
is wounded, and I am aPriloner; and if you do not
yield, you are all loft.
Will they give us Quarter then, (fays Tom
Smith) and we will yield ? /'// go and ask, if you
promife to yield, fays 'Robinfon; fo he ask'd the Cap-
tain, and the Captain then calls himfelf out, You
Smith, you know my Voice, if you Jay down your
Arms immediately, and fubmit, you fhall have your
Lives all but Will. Atkins.
Upon this, Will, dtkins cry'd out, For God's fake,
Captain^ give me Quarter, 'what have 1 done ? They
have been all as bad as I, which by the way was not
true neither; for.it feems this Will. Atkins was the
firll Man that laid hold of the Captain, when they
'firft mutiny'd, and ufed him barbaroufly, in tying
his Hands, and giving him injurious Language.
However, .the Captain told him he muft lay down
his Arms ac Difcretion, and truft to the Gover-
nour's
nour's Mercy,^by which he meant me; for they
all cull'd me Governour.
In a word, they all laid down their Arms, and
jgg'd their Lives; and I Cent the Man that had
p.uly'd with them, and two more, who bound
them all; and then my great Army of fo Men,
which particularly with thole three, were all but
eight, came up and feiz'd upon them all, and upon
their Boat, only that I kept my felf and one more
out of Sight, for Reafons of State.
Our next Work was to repair the Boat, and
think of feizing the Ship; and as for the Captain,
now he had Leifure to parly with them: He expo-
fulatcd with them upon theVillanyof theirPra-
ctices with him, and at length upon the farther
Wickedncfs of their Defign, and how certainly it
tnuft bring them to Mifery and Diilrefs in the End,
and perhaps to the Gallows.
They all appear'd very penitent, and begg'dhard
for their Lives : as for that, he told them they
were none of his Prifoners, but the Commander of
the Ifland > that they thought they had fet him on
Shore in a barren uninhabitated Ifland, but it had
pleafed .God fo to direct them, that the Ifland
was inhabited, and that the Governour was an
Engliftj Man; that he might hang them all there, if
he pleafed; but as he had given them all Quarter,
he fuppoftd he would fend them to England to be
dealt with there, as Juftice requir'd, except At-
kins, who he was commanded by the Governour to
advife to prepare for Death; for that he would be
hang'd in the Morning.
Though this was all a Fi£Hon of his own, yet
it had its defired Effeft; Atkins fell upon his Knees
to beg the Captain to intercede with the Gover-
nour for his Life j and all the reft begg'd of him
for
for God's Sake, that they might not be fent to
England:
It now occurr'd to me, that the time of our De-
liverance was come, and that it would be a moft
eafy thing to bring thefe Fellows in, to be hearty
in getting Pofleflion of the Ship } fo I retir'd in the
Dark from them, that they might not fee what
Kind of a Governour they had, and call'd the Cap-
tain to me. W hen I call'd, as at a good Diftance,
one of the Men was order'd to fpeak again, and fay
to the Captain, Captain, the Commander calls for
you; and prefently the Captain reply'd, Tell bis
Excellency I am jlift a coming: This more perfect-
ly amufed them; 'and they all believed that the
Commander was juft by with his fifty Men.
Upon the Captain's coming to me, I told him
%iy Projcct forfeizing the Ship, which he lik'dof
•wonderfully well, and refolv'd to put it in Execu-
tion the next Morning.
But in order to execute it with more Art, and
fecurity of Succefs, I told him, we muft divide the
Prifoners, and that he fhould go and take Atkins
and two more of the worft of them, and fend them
pinion'd to the Cave where the others lay: This
was committed to Friday and the two Men who
came on Shore with the Captain.
They convey'd them to the Cave, as to a Pri- '
fon ; and it was indeed a difmal Place, efpecially to
Men in their Condition.
The other I order'd to my Bower^ as I call'd flp
of which 1 have given a full Description j ana
as it was fcnc'd in, and they pinion'd, the Place
. was fecure enough, confidering they were upon
their Behaviour.
To thefe in the Morning I fent the Captain, who
was to enter into a Parley with them, in a Word
to try them, and tell me, whether he thought they
might
might be trufted or no, to go on Board and furprize
the Ship. He talk'd to them of the Injury done
him, of the Condition they were brought to; and
that though the Governour had given them Quar-
ter for their Lives, as to the prefent Action, yet
that if they were Tent to England^ they would all
be hnng'd in Chains, to be fure j blu that if•they
would join in fo juft an Attempt, as to recover the
Ship, he would have the Govcrnour's Engagement
for their Pardon.
Any one may guels how readily fuch a Propofal
would be accepted by Men in their Condition;
they fell down on their Knees. to the Captain, and
promifed with the deepeft Imprecations, that they
would be faithful to him to'thelaft Drop, and
that they fhould owe their Lives to him, and
would go with him all over the World, thatch^y
would own him for a Father to them as long as
they liv'd.
Well, fays the Captain, I muft go and tell the
Governour what you fay, and fee what I can do
to bring him to confent to it: So he brought me
an Account of the Temper he found them in;
and that he verily believ'd they would be faith-
ful.
However, that we might be very fecure, I told
him he fhould go back again, and chufe out thole
five, and tell them, they might fee that he did not
want Men, that he would take out thofe five to be
his Affiftants, and that the Governour would keep
the other two, and the three that were fent Prifo-
ners to the Cattle (my Cave) as Hoftages, for the
Fidelity of thofe five} and that if they prov'd un-
faithful in the Execution, the five Holtages fhould
be hang'd in Chains alive upon the Shore.
This look'd fevere, andconvinc'd them that the
Governour
Governour was in Earneft} however they had' rid
Way left them, but to accept it j • and it was now1
the Bufinefs of the Prifoners, as much as of the
Captain, to perfuade the other five to do their
Duty.
Our Strengjh was now thus ordered for the Ex-
pedition: i. The Captain, his Mate, and Paflen-
ger. i. Then the two Prifoners of the firft Gang,
to whom having their Characters from the Captain,
I had given their Liberty, and trufted them with
Arms. 3. The other two who I had kept till now$
in my Bower, pinion'dj but upon the Captain's
Motion, had now releas'd. 4. Thefe five releas'd
at laft : So that they were twelve in all, befides five
we kept Prifoners in the Cave, for Hoftages.
I ask'd the Captain, if he was wHling to ven-
ture with thefe Hands on Board the Ship ; for
as. for me and my Man Friday, 1 did not think
it was proper for us to ftir, having feven Men
left behind j and it was Employment enough for
us to keep them afunder, and fupply them with
Victuals.
As to the five in the Cave, I refolv'd to keep
them faft, but Friday went in twice a Day to them,.
to fupply them with NecefTariesj and I made the
other two carry Provisions to a certain Diftance^
where Friday was to take it.
When. I fhew'd my felf to the two Hoftages, it
was with'the Captain, who told them, I was the
Perfon this Governour had order'd to look after
them, and that it was the Governour's Pleafure they
fhould not ftir any where, 'but by my Directi-
on i that if they did, they ihould be fetch'd into,
the Cattle, and be lay'd in Irons i fo that as we
never fuffered them to fee me as Governour, fo I
nowappear'd as another Perfon, and fpoke of the
Y Gover-
jovernour, the Gaiifon, the Cattle, and the like,
ipon all Occafions. ,
The Captain now had no Difficulty before him,
5Ut to furnifh his two Boats, flop the Breach of rj
Dnc, and Man them. He made his Paflenger j
Captain of one, with four other Men; and him- ,-
felf, and his Mate, and five more went in the o- r
ther: And they contriv'd their Bufinefs very well} J' ;
for they came up to the Ship about Midnight: As
Toon as they came within Call of the Ship, he made
Robinfon hale them, and tell them they had brought
off the Men and the Boat, but that it was a long ^
time before they had found them, and the like;
holding them in a Chat till they came to the Ship's |a
fide; when the Captain and the Mate, entring or
firft with their Arms, immediately knock'd down ^
the fecond Mate and Carpenter with the But-end
of their Muskets. Being very faithfully feconded
by their Men, they fecur'd all the reft that were
upon the Main and Quarter Decks, and began to
faften the Hatches to keep them down who were
below, when the other Boat and their Men entring
at the fore Chains, fecur'd the Fore-Caftle of the
Ship, and the Scuttle which went down into the
Cook-Room, making three Men they found there
T% 'f ' 1*
Pnfoners. to
When this was done, and all fafe upon Decline
Captain order'd the Mate with three Men to break
into the Round-Houfe, where the new Rebel Cap-
tain lay, and having taken the Alarm, was gotten
up, and with two Men and a Boy had gotten Fire
Arms in their Hands, and when the Mate with a
Crow fplit open the Door, the new Captain and
his Men fir'd boldly among them, and wounded the
Mate with a Musket Ball, which broke his Arm,
and wounded two more of the Men, but kill a
no Body. I S]
The Mate calling for Help, rufh'd however in-
to the Round-Houfe, wounded as he was, and
with his Piftol fhot the new Captain thro' the
Head, the Bullet entring at his Mouth, and came
out again behind one of his Ears; fo that he never
fpoke a Word; upon which the reft yielded, and
the Ship was taken effectually, without any more
Lives loll.
As foon as the Ship was thu& fecur'd, the Cap-
tain order'd feven Guns to be fir'd, which was the
Signal agreed upon with me, to give me Notice
of his Succefs, which you may be fure I was very
glad to hear, having fat watching upon the Shore
for it till near two of the Clock in the Morning.
Having thus heard the Signal plainly, I laid me
downj and it having been a Day of great Fatigue
to me, I flept very found, till 1 was fomething fur-
priz'd with the Noife of a Gun; and prefently
flatting up, I heard a Man call roe by the Name of
Governour, Governour, and prefently I knew the
Captain's Voice, when climbing up to the Top of
the Hill, there he flood, and pointing to the Ship,
he embrac'd me in his Arms, My dear Friend and
Deliverer^ fays he, there's your Ship,forjhe is all yours^
andfo are -we and all that belong to her. I caft my Eyes
to the Ship, and rhere fhe rode within little more
than half a Mile of the Shore; for they had weigh-
ed her Anchor as foon as they were Mafters of her;
and the Weather being fair, had brought her to an
Anchor juft againft'the Mouth of the little Creek j
and the Tide being up, the Captain had brought
the Pinnace in near the Place where I at firft land-
ed my Rafts, and fo landed juft at my Door.
I was at firft ready to fink down with the Sur-
prize. For I faw my Deliverance indeed vifibly
put into my Hands, all things eafy, and a large
Ship juft ready to carry me away whither I plea-
Y i " fed
fed to go. At firft, for fome time, I was not able
to anfwer him one Word j but as he had taken me
in his Arms, I held faft by him, or I fhould have
fallen to the Ground.
He perceived the Surprize, and immediately
pulls a Bottle out of his Pocket, and gave me a
.Dram of Cordial, which he had brought on pur-
pofe for me j after I had drank it, I fat down up-
on the Ground ; and though it brought me to my
felf, yet it was a good while before I could fpeak
a Word to him.
All this while the poor Man was in as great an
Extafy as I, only not under any Surprize, as I was;
and he faid a thoufand kind tender things to me, to
compofe me and bring me to my felf j but fuch was
the Flood of Joy in my Breaft, that it put all my
Spirits into Confufionj at laft it broke out into
Tears, and in a little while after, I recovered my
Speech.
Then I took my Turn, and embrac'd him as
my Deliverer} and we rejoic'd together. I told
him, I look'd upon him as a Manfent from Heaven
to deliver me, and that the whole Tranfa&ion
feemed to be a Chain of Wonders 5 that fuch things
as thefe were the Teilimonies we had of a feciet
Hand of Providence governing the World, and an
Evidence, that the Eyes of an infinite Power could
fearch into the remoteft Corner of the World, and
fend Help to the Miferable whenever hepleas'd.
I forgot not to lift up my Heart in Thankful-
nefs to Heaven, and what Heart could forbear to
blefs him, who had not only in a miraculous Man-
ner provided for one in fuch a Wildernefs, and
in. fuch a defolateCondition, but from whom every
Deliverance mud always be acknowledged to pro-
cee-d. . ;
When
When we had talk'd a while, the Captain told
me he had brought me fome little Refrefhment,
fnch as the Ship afforded, and fuch as the Wretches
that had been fo long his Mafters had not plunder'd
him of: Upon this he call'd aloud to the Boat, and
bid his Men bring the things afhore that were for
the Governourj and indeed it was a Prefent, as if
I had been one not that was to be carry'd away
along with them, but as if I had been to dwell
upon the Ifland ftill, and they were to go without
me.
Firft he had brought me a Cafe of Bottles full
of excellent Cordial Waters, fix large Bottles of
Madura Wine j the Bottles held two Quarts a-piece}
two Pound of excellent good Tobacco, twelve good
Pieces of the Ships Beef, and fix Pieces of Pork,
with a Bag of Peafe, and about a hundredweight
of Bisket.
He brought me alfo a Box of Sugar, a Box of
Flower, a Bag full of Lemons, and two Bottles
of Lime-juice, and abundance of other things:
But befides thefe, and what was a thoufand times
more ufeful to me, he brought me fix clean new
Shirts, fix very good Neckcloaths, two Pair of
Gloves, one Pair of Shoes, a Hat, and one Pair of
Stockings, and a very good Suit of Cloaths of his
own, which had been worn but very little: In a
Word, he cloathed me from Head to Foot.
It was a very kind and agreeable Prefent, as any
one may imagine, to one in my Circumftances: But
never was any thing in the World of that Kind fo
unpleafanf, awkard, and uneafy, as it was to me to
wear fuch Cloaths at their firlt putting on.
After thefe Ceremonies paft, and after all his
good things were brought into my little Apart-
ment, we began to confult what was to be dqne
with the Prifoners we had; for it was worth con.
Y J fidcrin^
iidering, whether we might venture to take them
uvay with us or no, efpecially two of them, who
we knew to be incorrigible and refractory to the
\i\ Degree; and the Captain faid, he knew they
were fuch Rogues, that there was no obliging
them, and if he did carry them away, it mult be
in Irons, as Malefactors to be delivered over to Ju-
llice at the firft Englijh Colony he {hould come at;
and J found that the Captain himfelf was very au-
xious about it.
Upon this, I told himr that if he defir'd it, I
durft undertake to bring the two Men he fpokc of,
to make it their own Requeft that he fhould leave
them upon the Ifland:' IJhould be •very glad of that,
fays the Captain, with all my Heart,
Well, fays I, I will fend for them up, and talk
with them for you; fa I caufcd Friday and the two
Hoftages, for they were now difcharg'd, their Com-
rades having perform'd their Promife} I fay, I cau-
!cd them to go to the Cave, and bring up the five
Men pinion'd, as they were, to the Bower, and
keep them there 'till I came.
After feme time, I came thither drefs'd in ray
new Habit, and now 1 was call'd Governouragain;
being all met, and the Captain with me, I caufed
the Men to be brought before me, and I told them,
I had had a full Account of their villainous Beha-
viour to the Captain, and how they had run away
with the Ship, and were preparing to commit far-
ther Robberies, but that Providence had en-
fnar'd them in their own Ways, and that they
were fallen into the Pit which they had digged tor
others.
I let them know, that by my Direction the Ship
had been feiz'd, that fhe lay now in the Road; and
they might fee by and by, that their new CaPtai"

had receiv'd the Reward of his Villany j for that
they might fee him hanging at the Yard-Arm.
That as to them, I wanted to know what they
had to fay, why I fhould not execute them as Pi-
rates taken in the Fact, as by my Commiffion they
could not doubt I had Authority to do.
One of them anfwer'd in the Name of the reft,
That they had nothing to fay but this, That when
they were taken the Captain promis'd them their
Lives, and they humbly implor'd my Mercy: But
I told them, I knew not what Mercy to fhew them }
for as for my felf, I had refolv'd to quit the
Ifland with all my Men, and had taken Paflage
with the Captain to go for England: And as for
the Captain, he could not carry them to England
other than as Prifoners in Irons, to be try'd for
Mutiny, and running away'with the Ship ; the
Confequence of which, they muft needs know,
would be the Gallows; fo that I could not tell
which was beft for them, urjefs they had a mind
to take their Fate in the Ifland } if they defir'd that,
I did not care, as I had Liberty to leave it, I had
fome Inclination to give them their Lives, if they
thought they could fhift on Shore.
They feem'd very thankful for it, faidthey would
much rather venture to flay there, than to be car-
ry'd to 'England to be hang'd , fo I left it on that
Iflue.
However, the Captain feem'd to make fome
Difficulty of it, as if he durft not leave them
there : Upon this I feem'd a little angry with the
Captain, and told him, That they were my Prifo-
ners, not his y and that feeing I had offer'd them
fo much Favour,'! would be as good as my Word >
and that if he did not think fit to confent to it, t
would fct them at Liberty as I found them; and
Y4 if
if he did not like it, he might take them again it
he could catch them.
Upon this they appeared very thankful, and I ac-
cordingly fet them at Liberty, and bad them retire
into the Woods to the Place whence they came,
and I would leave them Come Fire Arms, fome
Ammunition, and fome Directions how they fhould
live very well, if they thought fit.
Upon this I prepar'd to go on Board the Ship,
but told the Captain, that I would ftay that Night
to prepare my Things, and defir'd him to go on
Board in the mean time, and keep all right in the
Ship, and fend the Boat on Shore the next Day for
me ; ordering him in the mean time to caufe the
new Captain, who was kill'd, to be hang'd at the
Yard-Arm, that thefe Men might fee him.
When the Captain was gone, I fent for the Men
up to me to my Apartment, and entred feriouily
into Difcourfe with them of their Circumftances.
I told them, I thought they had made a right
Choice j that if the Captain carry'd them away,
they would certainly be hanged. 1 fhewed them
the new Captain, hanging at the Yard-Arm of the
Ship, and told them they had nothing lefsto exptft.
When they had all declar'd their Willingndsto
ftay, I then told them, I would let them into the
Story of my living there, and put them into the
Way of making it eafie to them. Accordingly I
gave them the whole Hiftory of the Place, and of
my coming to it; fhew'd them my Fortifications,
the way 1 made my Bread, planted my Corn, cu-
red my Grapes j and in a word, all that was nc-
:eflary to make them eafy: I told them the Story
ilfo of the fixteen Spaniards that were to be expe-
lled j for whom 1 left a Letter, and made them
promife to preat them in common with themfelves.

I left them my Fire Arms, viz. Five Muskets,
three Fowling Pieces, and three Swords. I had
above a Barrel and half of Powder left; for after
the firft Year or two, I ufed but little, and wafted
none. I gave thera a Defcriptiow of the Way I
manag'd the Goats, and Directions to milk and
fatten them, and to make both Butter andCheefe.
In a word, I gave them every Part of my own
Story i and I told them, I would prevail with the
Captain to leave them two Barrels of Gun-Powder
more, and fome Garden-Seeds, which I told them
I would have been very glad of; alfo I gave them
the Bag of Peafe which the Captain had brought
me to eat, and bade them be fure to fow and en-
creafe them.
Having done all this, I left them the next Day,
nnd went on Board the Ship: We prepared imme-
diately to fail, but did not weigh that Night:
The next Morning early, two of the five Men
came fwimming to the Ship's Side, and making a
moft lamentable Complaint of the other three, beg-
ged to be taken into the Ship, for God's fake, for
they fhould be murthered, and begg'd the Captain
to take them on Board, though he hang'd them
immediately.
Upon this the Captain pretended to have no.
Power without me } but after fome Difficulty,
and after their fplemn Promifes of Amendment,
they were taken on Board, and were fome time af-
ter foundly whipp'd and pickl'd j after which,
they prov'd very honeft and quiet Fellows.
Some time after this, the Boat was order'd on
Shore, the Tide being up, with the Things promi-
fed to the Men, to which the Captain, at mylnter-
ceffion, caufed their Chefts and Cloaths to be add-
ed, which they took, and were very thankful forj
I alfo encourag'd them, by telling them, that if
it
it lay in my way to fend any Veflel to take them in,
I would not forget them.
When I took leave of this Ifland, I carry'd on
Board for Reliques the great Goat's-Skin-Cap I
had made, my Umbrella, and my Parrot; alfo I
forgot not to take the Money I formerly mention'd,
which had lain by me fo long ufelcfs, that it was
grown rufty, or tarnifh'd, and could hardly pafs
for Silver, till it had been a little rubb'd, and han-
dled ; as alfo the Money I found in the Wreck of
the Spanijh Ship.
And thus I left the Ifhnd, the Nineteenth of
December, as I found by the Ship's Account, in
the Year 1686, after 1 had been upon it eight and
twenty Years, two Months, and 19 Days; being
deliver'd from this fecond Captivity, the fame Day
of the Month that I firft made my Efcape in the
Barco-LongO) from among the Moors of Sallee.
In this Veflel, after a long Voyage, I arriv'd in
England the Eleventh of June, in the Year 1687,
having been thirty and five Years abfent.
When I came to. England^ I was as perfect a
Stranger to all the World, as if I had never been
known there. My Benefactor and faithful Stew-
ard, who I had left in Trull with my Money, was
alive, but had had great Misfortunes in the World;
was become a Widow the fecond Time, and very low
in the World: I made her eafy as to what fhe ow'd
me, afluring her, I would give her no Trouble; but
on the contrary, in Gratitude to her former Care
and Faithfulnefs to me, I reliev'd her, as my little
Stock would afford, which at that Time would
indeed allow me to do but little for her j but I af-
fiir'd her,I would never forget her former Kindnefs
to mej nor did I forget her^ when I had fufficient
to help her, as {hall be obferv'd in its place.
i
I wept
I went down afterwards into Yorkjhire; but my
Father was dead, and my Mother, and all the Fa-
mily extinct, except that I found two Sifters, and
two of the Children of one of my Brothers, and as
1 had been long ago given over for dead, there had
been no Provifion made for me; fo that in a Word,
I found nothing to relieve, or. affift mej and that
little Money I had, would not do much for me, as
to fettling in the World.
I met with one Piece of Gratitude indeed, which
I did not expect; and this was, That the Mafter
of the Ship, who I had fo happily deliver'd, and
by the fame Means fav'd the Ship and Cargo, ha-
ving given a very handfome Account to the Own-
ers, of the Manner how I had fav'd the Lives of
the^Men, and the Ship, they invited me to meet
them, and fome other Merchants concern'd, and
all together made me a very handfome Compliment
upon the Subject, and a. Prefent of alfnoft two
hundred Pounds .Sterling. ,
But after making feveral Reflections upon the
Circumftances of my Life, and how little way this
would go towards fettling me in the World, I re-
folv'd to go to jLw£o#, and fee if I might not come
by fome Information of the State of my Plantation
in ihe Brafils, and of what was become of my Part-
ner, who I had reafon to fuppofe had fome Years
now given me over for dead.
With this View I took Shipping for Lisbon^
where I arriv'd in Jlpril following; my Man Fri-
day accompanying me very honeftly in all thefe
Rarnblings, and proving a moft faithful Servant up-
on all Occafions.
When I came to Lisbon^ I found out by Enqui-
ry, and to my particular Satisfaction, my old Friend
the Captain of the Ship, who firll took me up at
Sea, off of the Shore of Aftick: He was now
• , grown
grown old, and had left off the Sea, having put I a:
his Son, who was far from a young Man, into his prove
Ship} and who ftill ufed the Brafil Trade. The Whci
old Man did not know me, and indeed I hardly ter? i
knew him $ but I foon brought him to my Remem- meet
brance, and as foon brought my felf to his Remem- Righ
brance, when I told him who I was. He
After fome paffionate Expreflions of the old Ac- • Degn
quaintance, I enquir'd, you may be fure, after my knew,
Plantation and my Partner: The old Man told me upon
he had not been in the Brafils for about nine Years; the be
but that he could aflure me, that when he came the K
away my Partner was living j but the Truftees, grants
who I had join'd with him to take Cognizance of
my Part, were both dead; that however, he be-
liev'd that I would have a very good Account of quiet
the Improvement of the Plantation} for that upon made
the general Belief of my being caft away, and "Title
drown'd, my Truftees had given in the Account of
the Produce of my Part of the Plantation, to the
Procurator Fifcal, who had appropriated it, in
cafe I never came to claim it j one Third to the I
King, and two Thirds to the Monaftery of St. A*- me ir;
lufiine^ to be expended for the Benefit of the Poor, Sum ,
ind for theConverfion of the Indium to theCatho- being
tick Faith j but that if I appear'd, or any one for held
tne, to claim the Inheritance, it fhould be reftor'd; "ove,
anly that the Improvement, or annual Production,
icing diftributed to charitable Ufes, could not be
•eftor'd} but he aiTur'd me, that the Steward of
:he King's Revenue (from Lands) and the Provedi-
lore, or Steward of the Monaftery, had taken great
:are all along, that the Incumbent, that is to fay,
ny Partner, gave every Year a faithful Account or
he Produce, of which they receiv'd duly ray
vloiety.
I asfc'd
I ask'd him if he knew to what height of Im-
provement he had brought the Plantation? And,
"Whether he thought it might be worth looking af-
ter? Or, Whether on my going thither, I mould
meet with no Obftru&ion to my poflefling my juft
Right in the Moiety ?
He told me, he could not tell exactly to what
Degree the Plantation was improv'd } but this he
knew, that my Partner was grown exceeding rich
upon the enjoying but one half of it} and that to
the beft of his Remembrance, he had heard, that
the King's Third of my Parr, which was it feems
granted away to fome other Monaftery, or Religi-
ous Houfe, amounted to above two hundred Moi-
dores a Year; that as to my being reftor'd to a
quiet Pofleffion of it, there was no queftion to be
made of thar, my Partner being alive towitnefs my
Title, and my Name being alfo enrolled in the
Regifter of the Country} alfo he told me, That
the Survivors of my two Truftees were very fair
honet t People, and very wealthy} and he believ'd
I would not only have their Affiftance for putting
me in poiTeffion, but would find a very considerable
Sum of Money in. their Hands, for my account j
being the Produce of the Farm while their Fathers
held the Truft, and before it was given up as a-
bove, which, as he remember'd, was for about
twelve Years.
I fhew'd my felf a little concern'd, and uneafy at
this Account, and enquir'd of the old Captain, How
it came to pafs, that the Truftees fhould thus dif-
pofe my Effe&s, when he knew that 1 had made ray
Will, and had made him, the Portuguefe Captain,
my univerfal Heir, &c.
He told me, that was true} but that as there
\vas no Proof of my being dead, he could not act
as Executor, until {ome certain Account fhould
come
come of my Death, and that befides, he was not
willing to intermeddle with a thing fo remote}
that it was true he had regifter'd my Will,
and put in his Claim j and could he have given
any Account of my being dead or alive, he would
have acted by Procuration, and taken Pofleffion of
the Ingenio, fo they call'd the Sugar-Houfe,and had
given his Son, who was now at the Brafils, Order
co do it.
But, fays the old Man, I have one Piece of
News to tell you, which perhaps may not be fo
acceptable to you as the reft, and that is, That
believing you were loft, and all the World believ-
ing fo alfo, your Partner and Truftees did of-
fer to accompt to me in your Name, for fix or
eight of the firft Years of Profits, which I receiv'd;
but there being at that time, fays he, great Dif-
burfements for encreafing the Works, building an
Ingenioy and buying Slaves, it did not amount to
near fo much as afterwards it produced : However,
fays the old Man, I fhall give you a true Account
of what I have received in all, and how I have
difpofed of it.
After a few Days farther Conference with this
ancient Friend, he brough t me an Account of the fix
firft Years Income of my Plantation, fign'd by my
Partner and the Merchants Truftees, being al-
ways deliver'd in Goods, viz. Tobacco in Roll,
and Sugar in Chefts, befides Rum, Moloflus, &(•
which is the Confequence of a Sugar Work; and
-I found by this Account, that every Year the In-
come confiderably encreafcd; but as above, the
Disburfement being large, the Sum at firft was
fmall: However, the old Man let me fee, that he
was Debtor to me 47o"Moidores of Gold, befiaes
60 Chefts of Sugar, and if double Rolls of .To-
bacco which were loft in his Ship i he having been
Ship-
Ship-wreck'd coming Home to Lisbon about II
Years after my leaving the &lj£fi*'•'::': •,.•«?:"!*N;•
The good Man then began to complain of his
Misfortunes, and how he had been oblig'd to make
Ufe of my Money to recover his Lofles, and buy
him a Share in a new Ship: However, my old
Friend, fays he, you'fhall not want a Supply in your
Neceffity; and as foon as my Son returns, you fhall
be fully fatisfy'd.
Upon this, he pulls out an old Pouch, and
gives me 160 Portugal Moidores in Gold; and giv-
ing me the Writing of his Title to the Ship, which
his Son was gone to the Brafils in, of which
he was a Quarter Part Owner, and his Son another,
he puts them both into, my Hands for Security of
the reft.
I was too much mov'd with the Honefty and
Kindnefs of the poor Man, to be able to bear this j
and remembring whar he had done for me, how
he had taken me up at Sea, and how generoufly he
had ufed me on all Occafions, and particularly,
how fincere a Friend he was now to me, I could
hardly refrain weeping at what he faid to me:
Therefore firft I asked him, if his Circumftances
admitted him to fpare fo much Money at that time,
and if it would not ftraitcn him? He told me, he
could not fay but it might ftraiten him a little j but
however it was my Money, and I might want it
more than he.
Every thing the good Man faid was full of Af-
fection, and I could hardly refrain from Tears
while he fpoke: In fhort, \ took 100 of the Moi-
dores, and eall'd for a Pen and Ink to give him a
Receipt for them, then 1 returned him the reft, and
told him, If ever I had Polleffion of the Plantation,
I would return the other to him alfo, as indeed I af-
terwards did j and that as to the Bill of Sale of
his
his Part in his Son's Ship, I would not take it by
any Means; but that if I wanted the Money, I
found he was honeft enough to pay me; and if I
did not, but came to receive what he gave me rea-
fon to expect, I would never have a Penny more
from him.
When this was pafs'd, the old Man began to ask
me, If he fhould put me into a Method to make my
Claim to my Plantation ? I told him, I thought to
go over to it my felf: He faid, I might do fo if I
pleas'd; but that if I did not, there were ways e-
nough to fecure my Right, and immediately to ap-
propriate the Profits to my Ufe; and as there were
Ships in the River of Lisbon^ juft ready to go away
to Bra/il, he made me enter my Name in a publick
Regifter, with his Affidavit, affirming upon Oath
that I was alive, and that I was the fame Perfon
who took up the Land for the Planting the faid
Plantation at firft.
This being regularly attefred by a Notary, and
i Procuration affix'd, he directed me to fend it with
i Letter of his Writing, to a Merchant of his Ac-
quaintance at the Place, and then propos'd'my
laying with him till an Account came of the re-
urn.
Never any Thing was more honourable, than
he Proceedings upon this Procuration } for in lefs
han feven Months I receiv'd a large Packet from
he Survivors of my Truftees the Merchants, tor
vhofe Account I went to Sea, in which were the
allowing particular Letters and Papers, enclos'd.
Firft, There was the Account current of the
'roduce of my Farm, or Plantation, from the Year
?hen their Fathers had ballanc'd with my old For-
igal Captain, being for fix Years; the Ballancc ap-
sar'd to be 1174 Moidores in .my Favour.

 Secondly, There was the Account of four Years
more while they kept the Effects in their Hands,
before the Government claim'd the Adminiftrati-
on, as being the Effects of a Perfon not to be
found, which they call Civil Death; and the Bal-
lance of this, the Value of the Plantation encrea-
fing, amounted to Cruifadoes, which made
3141 Moidores.
Thirdly, There was the Prior of the Auguftine's
Account, who had receiv'd the Profits for above
fourteen Years ; but not being to account for what
was difpos'd to the Hofpital, very honeftly de-
clar'd he had 871 Moidores not diftributed, which
he acknowledged to my Account j as to the King's
Part, that refunded nothing.
There was a Letter of my Partner's, congratu-
lating me very affectionately upon my being alive,
giving me an Account how the Eftate was im-
prov'd, and what it produced a Year, with a Par-
ticular of the Number of Squares or Acres that it
contain'd; how planted, how many Slaves there
were upon it, and making two and twenty Crofles
for Blemngs, told.me he had faid.fo many Ave Ma-

By the fame Fleet, my two Merchant Truflees
(hipp'd me i zoo Chcfts of Sugar, 800 Rolls of To-
bacco, and the reft of the whole Accomptin Gold.
I might well fay, now indeed, That the latter
.End of 'Job was better than the Beginning. It is
impoflible to exprcfs the Flutterings of my very
Heart, when I look'd over thele Letters, and ef-
pecially when I found all my Wealth about me; for
as the Brajil Ships come all in Fleets, the lame
Ships which brought my Letters, brought my
Goods j and the Efte&s were fare in the River be-
fore the Letters came to my Hand. In a word, I
turned pale, and grew fick} and rjad not the old
Man run and fetch'd me a Cordial, I believe the
fudden Surprize of Joy had overfet Nature, and I
had dy'd upon the Spot.
Nay after that, I continu'd very ill, and was fo
fome Hours, 'till a Phyfician being fent for, and
fomething of the real Caufe of my Illnefc being
known, he order'd me to be let Blood ; after
which, I had Relief, and grew well : But I verily
believe, if it had not been eas'd by a Vent given
in that manner to the Spirits, I mould have
I was now Mafter, all on a fudden, of above
j*ooo/. Sterling in Money, and had an Eftate, as
I might well call it, in the'Braftls, of above a
thoufand Pounds a Year, as fure as an Eftatc or
Lands in England: And, in a word, I was in a
Condition which I fcarce knew how to understand,
or how to compofe my felf, for the Enjoyment
of it.
The firft thing I did, was to recompense my
original Benefactor, my good old Captain, Wn°
had been firft charitable to me in my DiStreis,
kind to me in my Beginning, and honeft to roe »j
the End : I fliew'd him all that was fent me, J
told
told him, that next to the Providence of Heaven,
which difpofes all Things, it was owing to him j
and that it now lay on me to reward him, which
I would do a hundred fold: So I firft return'd to
him the hundred Moidores I had receiv'd of him,
then I fent for a Notary, and caufed him to draw
up a general Releafe or Discharge for the 470
Moidores, which he had acknowledg'd he ow'd
me in the fulleil and firmeft Manner poffible; af-
ter which, I caufed a Procuration to be drawn,
impowering him to be my Receiver of the annual
Profits of my Plantation, and appointing my Part-
ner to accompt to him, and make the Returns by
the ufual Fleets to him in my Name ; and aClaufe
in the End, being a Grant of 100 Moidores a
Year to him, during his Life, out of the Effects,
and f o Moidores a Year to his Son after him, for
h;s Life: And thus I requited my old Man.
I was now to confider which way to fleer my
Courfe next, and what to do with the Eftate that
Providence had thus put into my Hands , and in-
deed I had more Care upon my Head now, than
I had in my filent State of Life in the Ifland,
where I wanted nothing .but what I had, ajid
had nothing but what I wanted : Whereas I had
now a great Charge upon me, and my Bufinefs
was how to fccure it. I had ne'er a Cave now to
hide my Money in, or a Place where it might lye
without Lock or Key, 'till it grew mouldy and
tarnifh'd before any Body would meddle with it:
On the contrary, I knew not where to put it, or
who to trutt with it. My old Patron, the Cap-
tain, indeed was honeft, and that was the only
Refuge I had.
In the next Place, my Intereft in the Brafils
feem'd to lummon me thither, but now I could
not tell how to think of going thither, 'till I had
Z 2 fettled
fettled my Affairs, and left my Effe&s in fome fafe
Hands behind me. At firft I thought of my old
Friend the Widow, who I knew was honett, and
would be juft to me ; but then fhe was in Yean,
and but Poor, and for ought I knew, might be in
Debt j fo that in a word, I had no way but to
go back to England my felf, and take my Efftfts
With me.
It was fome Months however before I refolved
upon this j and therefore, as I had rewarded the
old Captain fully, and to his Satisfaction, who had
been my former"Benefactor, fo I began to think of
my poor Widow, whofe Husband had been ray
fir ft Benefactor, and fhe, while it was in her Pow-
er, my faithful Steward and Inftructor. So the firft
thing" I did, I got a Merchant in Lisbon to write
to his Correfpondent in London^ not only to pay a
Bill, but to go find her out, and carry her in Mo-
ney an hundred Pounds from me, and to talk with
her, and comfort her in her Poverty, by telling her
fhe fhould, if I liv'd, have a farther Supply: Ac
the fame time I fent my two Sifters in the Coun-
try, each of them an hundred Pounds, they being,
though not in Want,' yet not in very good Cir-
cumttances; one having been marry'd, and kit a
Widow i and the other having a Husband not fo
kind to her as he fhould be.
But among.all my Relations, or Acquaintances,
I could not yet pitch upon one, to whom I ourlt
commit the Grofs of my Stock, that I might go
away to the Brafils, and leave things fafe behind
me ; and this greatly perplex'd me.
I had once a Mind to have gone to the Brafils,
and have fettled my felf there } for I was, as it
were, naturaliz'd to the Place; but I had feJWg"
tie Scruple in my Mind about Religion, whicft
infenfibly drew me back, of which I fhall lay
J more
fin?
O
that kept me from going there for the prelehti
and as I had made no Scruple of being openly of
the Religion of the Country, all the while I was
among them, fo neither did I yet} only that now
and then having of late thought more of it, than
formerly) when I began to think of living and dying
among them, I began to regret my having protefs'd
my felf a Papift, and thought it might not be the
belt Religion to die with.
But, as I have faid, this was not the main thing that
kept me from going to the Brafils^ but that real-
ly I did not know with whom to leave my Eftects
behind me; fo 1 refolv'd at laft to go to England
with it, where, if I arrived, I concluded I fliould
make fome Acquaintance, or find fome Relations
that would be faithful to me; and accordingly I
prepar'd to go for England with all my Wealth.
In order to prepare things for my going Home, I
fit tt, the BrafilFleet being juft going away, refolved
to give Anfwers fuitable to the jutt and faithful Ac-
count of things I had from thence; and firft to the
Prior of St. Auguftim I wrote a Letter full of Thanks
for their jult .Dealings, and the Offer of the 871
Moidores, which was indifpofed of, which I de-
lif'd might be given foo to the Monailery, and
371 to the Poor, as the Prior fhould direct, defi-
ting the good Padres Prayers for me, and the like.
I wrote next a Letter of Thanks to my two
Truftees, with all the Acknowledment that fo
much Juftice and Honefty cali'd for; as for fend-
ing them any Prefent, they were far above having
any Occafion of it.
Laftly, I wrote to my Partner, acknowledging
his Ihduftry in the improving the Plantation, and
his Integrity in encreaiing the Stock of the Works,
giving him Inftru&ions for his future Govem-
Z 3 . ment
mcnt of my Part, according to the Powers I had
left with my old Patron, to whom I defir'd him to
fend whatever became due to me, 'till he mould
hear from me more particularly; afTuring him that
it was my Intention, not only to come to him, but
to fettle my felf there for the Remainder of my
Life : To this I added a very handfom Prefent of
fome Italian Silks for his Wife, and two Daughters,
for fuch the Captain's Son inform'd me he had;
with two Pieces of fine Englijb Broad-Cloath, the
beft I could get in Lisbon, five Pieces of black Bays,
and fome Flanders Lace of a good Value.
Having thus fettled my Affairs, fold my Cargoe,
and turn'd all my Effects into good Bills of Ex-
change; my next Difficulty was, which Waytogo
to England: I had been accuftom'd enough to the
Sea, and yet I had a ftrange Averfion to going to
England by Sea at that time; and though I could
give no Reafon for it, yet the Difficulty encrcas'd
upon me fo much, that though I had once fhipp'd
my Baggage, in order to go, yet I alter'd my Mind,
and that not once, but two or three times.
It is true, I hud been very unfortunate by Sea,
and this might be fome of the Reafons: But let
no Man flight the ftrong Impulfes of his own
Thoughts in Cafes of fuch Moment: Two of the
Ships which I had fingled out to go in, I mean,
more particularly fingled out than any other, that
is to fay, fo as in one of them to put my things on
Board, and in the other to have agreed with the
Captain} J fay, two of thefe Ships mifcarry'djW'z.
one was taken by the Algerines, and the other was
catt away on the Start near Torbay, and all the Peo-
ple drown'd except three; fo that in either of thole
Veflels I had been made miferablej and in which
moll, it was hard to fay.
• . V Having
Having been thus harafs'd in my Thoughts,- my
old Pilot, to whom I communicated every thing,
prefs'd me earneflly not to go by Sea, but either
to go by Land to the Groyne, and erofs over the
Bay of Bifcay to RocheU^ from whence it was but
an eafy and fafe Journey by Land to Paris, and fo
to Calais and Dover ; or to go up to Madrid, and
fo all the Way by Land thro' France.
In a word, 1 was fo prepoflcfs'd agninftmy going
by Sea at all, except from Calais to Dover, that
I refoiv'd to travel all the Way by Land 4 which
as I was not in Hafte, and did not value the
Charge, was by much the pleafanter Wayj and to
make it more fo, my old Captain brought an En-
gliJJo Gentleman, the Son of a Merchant in Lisbon^
who was willing to travel with me : After which,
we pick'd up two move Englijh Merchants alfo, and
two young Portuguefe Gentlemen, the laft going to
Paris only; fo that we were in all fix of us, and
five Servants} the two Merchants and the two
* Portuguefe^ contenting themfelves with one Ser-
vant between two, to fave the Charge; and as for
me, 1 got an Engtijh Sailor to travel with me as
a Servant, befides my Man Friday^ who was too
much a Stranger to be capable of fupplying the
Place of a Servant on the Road.
In this Manner I let out from Lisbon; and our
Company being all very well mounted and armed,
we made a little Troop, whereof they did me the
Honour to call me Captain, as well becaufe
I was the oldell Man, as becuufe I had two Ser-
vants, and indeed was the Original of the whole
Journey.
'As I have troubled you with none of my Sea-
Journals, fo I fhall trouble you now with none of
n)y Land-Journal: But fome Adventures that hap-
Z 4 pen'd
pen'd to us in this tedious and difficult Journey, I
muft not omit.
When we came to Madrid, we being all of us
Strangers to Spain, were willing to ftay fome time
to fee the Court of Spain, and to fee what was
worth obferving } but it being the latter Part of
the Summer, we.haften'd away, and fet out from
Madrid about the Middle of Ottober: But when we
came to the Edge of Navarre, we were alarm'd at
feveral Towns on the Way, with an Account, that
fo much Snow was fallen on the French Side of the
Mountains, that feveral Travellers were obliged
to come back to Pampeluna, after having attem-
pted at an extream Hazard to pafs on.
When we came to Pampeluna it felf,we found it
fo indeed} and to me that had been always ufed
to a hot Climate, and indeed to Countries where
we could fcarce bear any Cloaths on, the Cold was
infufferable -, nor indeed was it more painful than
it was furprizing, to come but ten Days before out
of the OldCaftile, where the Weather was not only
warm, but very hot; and immediately to feel a
Wind from the Pyrenean Mountains, To very keen,
fo feverely cold, as to be intolerable, and to en-
danger benumbing and perilhing of our Fingers
and Toes.
Poor Friday was really frighted when he faw the
Mountains all cover'd with Snow, and felt cold
Weather, which he had never feen or felt before
in his Life.
To mend the Matter, when we came to Paw
feluna, it continued fnowing with fo much Vio-
lence, and fo long, that the People faid. Winter
was come before 'its time, and the Roads which
were difficult before, were now quite impaiTable:
For in a Word, the Snow lay in fome Places too
thick for us to travel -t and being not hard frozen, as
•is the Cafe in Northern Countries: There was no
going without being in Danger of being bury'd
alive every Step. We Itaid no lefs than twenty
Days at Pampeluna ; when feeing the Winter com-
ing on, and no likelihood of its being better ; for
it was the fevereft Winter all over Europe that had
been known in the Memory of Man. I propos'd
that we fhould all go away to Fontarabia, and there
raking Shipping for Eourdcaux^ which was a very
little Voyage.
But while we were confiJering this, there came
in four French Gentlemen, who having been ftopp'd
on the French Side of the Paffes, as we were on
theSpaniJb, had found out a Guide, whotraverfing
the C»untry near t'ue Head of Langwdoc, had
brought them over the Mountains by fuch Ways,
that they were not much incommoded with the
Snow} and where they met with Snow in any
Quantity, they fa id it was frozen hard enough to
bear them and their Horfes.
We fent for this Guide, who told us, he would
undertake to carry us the fame Way with no Ha-
zard from the Snow, provided we were armed fuf-
ficiently to protett us from wild Beafts; for he
faid, upon thefe great Snows, it was frequent for
fome Wolves to fhow themfelves at the Foot of
the Mountains, being made ravenous for Want
of Food, the Ground being covered with Snow:
We told him, we were well enough prepar'd for
fuch Creatures as they were, if he would enfure
us from a Kind of two-legged Wolves, which we
were told we were in molt Danger from, efpeci-
ally on the Preach Side of the Mountains. •
He farisfy'd us there was no Danger of that kind
in the Way that we^were to goj lo we readily a-
greed to follow him, as did alib twelve other Gen-
tlemen,
tlemen, with their Servants, fome French, fome Spa,-
nijb, who, as I faid, had attempted to go, and
were oblig'd to come back again.
Accordingly, we all fet out from Pampelufia,\vith
our Guide, on the fifteenth of November; and in-
deed, I was furpriz'd, when inftead of going for-
ward, he came directly back with us, on the fame
Road that we came from Madrid, above twenty
Miles j when being pafs'd two Rivers, and come
into the plain Country, we found our felves in a
warm Climate again, where the Country was plea-
fant, and no Snow to be feenj but on a fuddcn,
turning to the Left, he approach'd the Mountains
another Way ? and though it is true, the Hills and
Precipices look'd dreadful, yet he made fo many
Tours, fuch.Meanders, and led us by fuch wind-
ing Ways, that we were infenfibly pafs'd the
Height of the Mountains, without being much
incumbred with the Snow; and all on a Hidden,
he fhew'd us the pleafant fruitful Provinces of Lan-
guedcc and Gafcoign, all green and flourishing; tho'
indeed it was at a great Diilance, and we had fome
rough Way to pafs yet.
.We were a little uneafy however, when we found
it fnow'd one whole Day, and a Night, fo fall,
that we could not travel j but he bid us be eafy,
we ihould foon be.patt it all: We found indeed,
that we began to defcend every Day, and to come
more North than before } and fo depending upou
our Guide, we went on.
It was about two Hours before Night, when
our Guide being fomething before us, and not juft
in Sight, out rufhed three monttrous Wolves, and
after them a Bear, out of a hollow Way, adjoyn-
jng to a thick Wood} two of the Wolves flew up-
on the Guide, and had he been half a Mile before
us, he had been deyour'd indeed, before we could
have
J
have help'd him : One of them faftned upon his
Horfe, and the other attack'd'the Man with that
Violence, that he had not Time, or not Prefence
of Mind enough to draw his Piftol, but hollow'd
and cry'd out to us moft luftily ; my Man Friday '
being next to trie, I bid him•ride up, and fee what
was the Matter; as foon as Friday came in Sight
of the Man, he hollow'd as loud as t'other, O Ma-
fter! O Mafter! But like a bold Fellow, rode di-
rectly up to the poor Man, and with his Piftol
fliot the Wolf that attack'd him into the Head.
It was happy for the poor Man, that it was my
Man Friday; for he having been us'd to that kind
of Creature in his Country, had no Fear upon
him } but went clofe up.to him, and fhot him as
above} whereas any of us, would have fir'd at a
farther diftance, and have perhaps either mifs'd the
Wolf, or endanger'd fhooting the Man.
But it was enough to have terrify'd a bolder
Man than I, and indeed it alarm'd all our Compa-
ny, when with the Noife of Friday's Piftol, we
heard on both Sides the difmalleft Howling of
Wolves, and the Noife redoubled by the Echo of
the Mountains, that it was to us as if there had
been a prodigious Multitude of them j and per-
haps indeed there was not fuch a few, as that we
had no Caufe of Apprehenfions.
However, as Friday had kill'd this Wolf, the o-
ther that had faftned upon the Horfe, left him im-
mediately, and fled ; having happily faftned upon
his Head, where the Bofles of the Bridle had ftuck
in his Teeth } fo that he had not done him much
Hurt: The Man indeed was moft Hurt; for the
raging Creature had bit him twice, once on the
Arm, and the other time a little above his Kneej
and he was juft as it were tumbling down by the
Diforder
Difordcr of his Horfe, when Friday came up and
fhot the Wolf.
It is eafy to fuppofe, that at the Noife of Fri-
day's Piftol, we all mended our Pace, and rid up as
faft as the Way (which was very difficult) would
give us leave, to fee what was the Matter; asfoon
as we came clear of the Trees, which blinded us
before, we faw clearly what had been the Cafe,
and how Friday had difengag'd the poor Guide;
though we did not prefently difcern what kind of
Creature it was he had kill'd.
But never was a Fight manag'd fo hardly, and
in fuch a furprizing Manner, as that which follow'd
between Friday and the Bear, which gave us all
(though at firft we were furpriz'd and afraid for
him) the greateft Diverfion imaginable : As the
Bear is a heavy,. clumfey Creature, and does not
gallop as the Wolf does, who is fwift, and light;
io he has two particular Qualities, which generally
are the Rule of his Actions} Firft, As to Men, who
arc not his proper Prey; I fay, not his properPrey;
bccaufe tho' 1 can't fay what exceflive Hunger might
do, which was now their Cafe, the Ground being all
cover'd with Snow; but as to Men, he does not u-
fually'attempt them, unlcfs they firft attack him;
On the contrary, if you meet him in the Woods, if
vou don't meddle with him, he won't meddle jvith
you; but then you mull take Care to be very civil
to him, and give him the Road; for he is a veiy
nice Gentleman, he won't go a Step out of his Way
for a Princej nay, if you are really afraid, your
beft way is to look another Way, and keep going
on; for fometimes if you ftop, and Hand flill, and
look fteadily at him, he takes it for an Affront; but
if you throw or tofs any Thing at him, and it hits
him, though it were but a bit of a Stick, as big «
your Finder, he takes it for an Affront, and fcts all
bis
his other Bufinefs afide to purfue his Revengej for
he will have Satisfaction in Point of Honour} that
is his firft Quality: The next is, That if he be
once affronted, he will never leave you, Night or
Day, till he has'his Revenge} but follows at a good
round rare, till he overtakes you.
My Man Friday had deliver'd our Guide, and
when we came up to him, he was helping him off
from his Horfej for the Man was both hurt and
frighted, and indeed the laft more than the firftj
when on the fudden, we fpy'd the Bear come out of
the Wood, and a vaft monftrous one it was, thebig-
geft by far that ever I faw. We were all a little fur-
priz'd when we faw him; but when Friday faw him,
it was eafy to fee Joy and Courage in the Fellow's
Countenance; O! O! O ! fays Friday, three times,
pointing to him ;O Mafter; You give me te Leave, me
jhakee te Hand with him; me make you good laugh.
I was furpriz'd to fee the Fellow fo pleas'd ; Tou
Fool you, fays I, he will eat you up: Eatee me up !
Eatee me up! fays Friday, twice over again j Me
eatee him up: Me make you good laugh: 1 ou all ftay
here, me Jboiv you good laugh; fo down he fits, and
gets his Boots off in a Moment, and put on a Pair
of Pumps, (as we call the flat Shoes they wear)
and which he had in his Pocket, gives my other
Servant his Horfe, and with his Gun away he flew
fwift like the Wind.
The Bear was walking foftly on, and offer'd to
meddle with no Body, till Friday coming pretty
near, calls to him, as if the Bear could understand
him} Hark ye, hark yet fays Friday^ me fpeakee ivit
you: We folltfw'd at a Diftancej for now being
come down on the Gafcoign fide of the Mountains,
we were entred.a vail great Foreft, where the
Country was plain, and pretty open, though many
Trees in it fcatter'd here and there.
/ v .Friday
Ffiday, who had as we fay, the Heels of the Bear,
came up with him quickly, and takes up a great
Stone, and throws at him, and hit him jufton the
Headj but did him no more harm, that if he had
thrown it agaflift a Wall; but it anfvver'd Friday's
End j for the Rogue was fo void of Fear, that he
did it purely to make the Bear follow him, and
fhew us fbme Laugh, as he call'd it.
As foon as the Bear felt the Stone, and faw him,
he turns about, and comes after him, taking Devi-
.lifh long Strides, and fhuffling along at a ftrange
Rate, fo as would have put a Horfe to a middling
Gallop; away runs Friday', and takes his Courfe, as
if he run towards us for Help } fo we all refolv'd to
fire at once upon the Bear, and deliver my Man;
though I was angry at him heartily, for bringing
the Bear back upon us, when he was going about
his own Bufinefs another.Way; and efpecially I
was angry that he hadturn'd the Bear upon us, and
then run away } and I call'd out, Tou Dog, faid I, /;
this your making us laugh ? Come away, and take your
Hor/Cy that we may /hoot the Creature ; he hears me,
and cries out, No/hoot^ no fioot, ftand ftill^ you get
much Laugh. And as the nimble Creature run two
Foot for the Bead's one, he turn'd on a fudden, on
one fide of us, and feeing a great Oak-Tree fit for
his Purpofe, he beckon'd to us to follow, and
doubling his Pace, he gets nimbly up the Tree,
laying his Gun down upon the Ground, at about
five or fix Yards from the Bottom of the Tree.
The Bear foon came to the Tree, and we fol-
low'd at a Diftance; the firft Thing he did, he
ftopp'd at theGun, fmelt to it, but let it lye, and
up he fcrambles into the Tree, climbing like a Cat,
though fo monftroufly heavy : I was amaz'd at the
Folly, as I thought it, of my Man, and could nor
for my Life fee any Thing to laugh at yet, till «*-
ing
ing the Bear get up the Tree, we all rod nearer
to him.
W hen we came to the Tree, there was Friday
got out to the fmall End of a large Limb of the
Tree, and the Bear got about halfway to him j
as foon as the Bear got out to that part where the
Limb of the Tree was weaker, /&, fays he to us,
now you fee me teachee the Bear dance ; fo he falls a
jumping and fhaking the Bough, at which the Bear
began to totter, bue flood ftill, and began to look
behind him, to fee how he fhould get back; then
indeed we did laugh heartily : But Friday had not
done with him by a great deal j when he fees him
ftand ftill, he calls out to him again, as if he had
fuppos'd the Bear could fpeak Englifi ; IVhat^ you
no come farther ? Pray you come farther ; fo he left
jumping and {baking the Trees} and the Bear, juft
as if he had underftood what 'he faid, did come a
little farther, then he fell a jumping again, and the
Bear flopp'd again.
We thought now was a good time to knock him
on the Head, and I call'd to Friday to ftand ftill,
and we would (hoot the Bearj but he cry'd out
earnettly, O pray ! O fray ! No floot^ me float by
and ihen-, he would have faid, by and by. However,
to fhorten the Story, Friday danc'd fo much, and
the Bear flood fo ticklifh, that we had laughing
enough indeed, but ftill could not imagine what
the Fellow would doj for firft we thought he de-
pended upon fhaking the Bear offj and we found
the Bear was too cunning for that. too; for'he
would not go out far enough to be thrown down,
but clings fatt with his great broad Claws and
Feet, fo that we could not imagine what would
be the End of it, and where the Jeft would be at
laft.
But
But Friday put us out of doubt quickly; for
feeing the Bear cling faft to the Bough, and that
he would not be perl waded to come any farther}
Wel^ well, fays Friday, you no come farther, me go,
me go ; you no come to me, me go come to you ; and
upon this, he goes out to the fmalleft End of the
Bough, where it would bend with his Weight, and
gently let himfelf down by it, Hiding down the
Bough, till he came near enough to jump down
on his Feet, and away he run to his Gun, takes it
up, and {lands ftill.
Well, laid I to him, Friday, What will you do
now ? Why don't you fhoot him ? No /hoot, fays
Friday, no yet, me Jhoot now, me no kill; me ftay,
give you one more laugh; and indeed fo he did, as you
will fee prefently ; tor when the Bear fee his Ene-
my gone, he comes back from the Bough where he
Hood , but did it mighty leifurely, looking behind
him every Step, and coming backward till he got
into the Body of the Tree } then with the fame
hinder End foremort, he come down the Tree,
grafping it with his Claws, and moving one Foot
at a time, very leifurely } at this Juncture, and juft
before he could fet his hind Feet upon the Ground,
Friday ftcpt up clofe to him, clapt the Muzzel of
his Piece into his Ear, and {hot him dead as a
Stone.
Then the Rogue turn'd about, to fee if we did
not laugh, and when he faw we were pleas'd by
our Looks, he falls a laughing himfelf very loudj
fo we kill Bear in my Country, fays Friday; fo you
kill them, fays I, why you have no Guns: No,
fays he, no Gun, but /boot, great much long Arrow-
This was indeed a good Diverfion to us j but
we were ftill in a wild Place, and our Guide very
much hurt, and what to dp we.hardly knew} the
Howline of Wolves run much in my Head j and in-
deed,
deed, except the Noife I once heard on the Shore
of Africa, of which I have faid fomething already,
I never heard any thing that filled me with fo much
Horrour.
Thefe things, and the Approach of Night, cal-
led us off, or elfe, as Friday would have had us,
we fhould certainly have taken the Skin of this
monltrous Creature off, which was worth faving j
but we had three Leagues to go, and our Guide
haflen'd us, fo we left him, and went forward on
our Journey.
The Ground was ftill coverM with Snow, tho'
not fo deep and dangerous as on.the Mountains,
and the ravenous Creatures, as we heard arter-^
wards, were come down into the Foreft and plain
Country, prefs'd by Hunger to feck for Food; and
had done a great deal of Mifchief in the Villages,
where they furpriz'd the Country People, kill'd a
Preat many of their Sheep and Horfes, and Tome
eople too.
We had one dangerous Place to pafs, which
our Guide told us, if there were any more Wolves
in the Country, we fhould find them there; and
this was in a fmall Plain, lurrounded with Woods
on every Side, and a long narrow Defile or Lane,
which we we're to pafs to get through the Wood,
and then we fhould come to the Village where we
were to lodge.
It was within half an Hour of Sun-fet when we
entred the firft Woodi and a little after Sun-fet,
•when we came into the Plain, we met with no-
thing in the firlt Wood, except that in a little
Plain within the Wood, which was not above two
Furlongs over, we (aw five great Wolves crofs the
Road, full Speed one after another, as if they had
been in Chafe of fome Prey, and had it in View?,
A a they
they took no Notice of us, and were gone, and
out of our Sight in a few Moments.
,Upon this our Guide, who b,y the Way was a
wretched faint-hearted Fellow, bid us keep in a
ready Pofture -, for he believed there were more
Wolves a corning.
We kept our Arms ready,and our Eyesaboutus,
but we faw no more Wolves, 'till we came thro'
that Wood, which was near half a League, and en-
trcd the Plain; as foon as we came into the Plain,
we had Occaiion enough to look about us: The
firft Obj'cVwe met with, was a dead Horfe;
that is to fay, a poor Horfe which the Wolves
had kill'd, and at leaft a Dozen of them at Work;
ve could not fay eating of him, but picking of
his Rones rather; for they had eaten up all the
Flefh before.
We did not think fit to difturb them at their
Fealt, neither did they take much Notice of
us: Friday would have* let fly at them, but I
would not fuffer him by any Means j for I found
we were like to have more Bufinefs upon our
Hands than we were aware of. We were not
fone half over the Plain, but we began to hear the
Volves houl in the Wood on our Left, in a fright-
ful Manner, and prefently after we faw about a
hundred coming on diredly towards us, all in a
Bod'y, arid mot t of them in a Line, as regularly as
an Army drawn up by experienc'd Officers. I
ifcarce knew in what Manner to receive theml
but found to draw our felves in a clofe Line was
the only Way: fo we form'd in a Moment: But
that we might not have too much Interval, I or-
der'd, that only every other Man fhould fire5 an"
thac the others who had not fird fhould ftand rea-
dy to give them a fecond Volley immediately, it
they continued to advance upon us, and that then
. thofe
thofe who had fir'd at firft, fhould not pretend to
load their Fufees again, but ftand ready with every
one a Piftol; for we were all arm'd with a Fufee,
and a Pair of Piftols each Man } fo we were by
this Method able to fire fix Volleys, half of us at
a Time j however, at prefent we had no Ncceffi-
ty} for upon firing the firft Volley, the Enemy
made a full Stop, being terrify'd as well with the
Noife, as with the Fire; four of them being {hot
into the-Hea'd, dropp'd, feveral others were ^wound-
ed, and went bleeding off, as we could fee by the
Snow: I found they Itopp'd, but did not immedi-
ately retreat; whereupon remembring that I had
been told, that the fierceft Creatures were terri-
fy'd at the Voice of a Man, I caus'd all our Com-
pany to hollow as loud as we could; and I found
the Notion not altogether miftaken ; for upon our
Shout, they began to retire, and turn about; then
I order'd a fecond Volley to be fir'd, in their Rear,
which put them to the Gallop, and away they
went to the Woods.
This gave us leifure to charge our Pieces again,
and that we might lofenoTime, we kept going}
but we had but little more than loaded our Fufees,
and put our felves into a Readinefs, when we heard
a terrible Noife in the fame Wood, on our Left,
only that it was farther onward the fame Way we
were to go.
The Night was coming on, and the Light be-
fan to be dusky, which made it worfe on our Side j
ut the Noife encreafing, we could eafily perceive
that it was the howling and yelling of thofe hel-
iifh Creatures; and on a fudden, we perceiv'd i or
5 Troops of Wolves, one on our Left, one behind us,
and one on our Front ; fo that we feem'd to be
furrounded with 'em; however, as they did not
fall upon us, we kept our Way forward, as faft as
£ A a 2 we
we could make our Hmks go, which the Way be-
ing very rough, was only a good large Tr-.t 5 and
in this Manuer we rame in View o; the Entrance
of a Wood, through which we were to pals, at
the farther fide of the Plain ; but we were grat-
ly furpriz'd, when coming nearer the L::ne, or
Pafs, we few a confus'd Number ot YV< Ives itand-
ing juft at the Entrance.
On a fudden, at another opening of the Wood,
we heard the Noife of a Gun; and looking that
Way, out rufh'J a Hor.'e, with a Saddk, and a
Bridle on him, flying like the Wind, and (ixtcen
or fcvcntcen Wolves after hiir, full Speed; indeed,
the Horfe had the Heels 01 them ; but as we fup-
pos'd that he could not hold it at that rate, we
doubted'not but they would get up with him at
laft, and no queftion but they did.
But here we had a moft horrible Sight; for ri-
ding up to the Entrance where the Horie came out,
we found the Carcafs of another Horfe, and oi two
Men, devour'd by the ravenous Creatures, and one
of the Men was no doubt the fame who we heard
fir'd the Gun; for there lay a Gun jult by him nr'fl
off; but as to the Man, his Head, and the upper
Part of his Body, was eaten up.
This fill'd us with Horrour, and we knew not
what Courfe to tike, but the Creatures refoK'd us
foon ; for they gather'd about us prefently, in hopes
of Prey ; and I verily believe there were three hun-
dred of them : It happen'd very much to our Ad-
vantage, that at the Entrance into the Wood, but
a little Way from it, there lay fome large Timber
Trees, which had been cut down the Summer be-
fore, and I fuppofe lay there for Carriage; I drew
my little Troop in among thofe Trees, and placing
our felves in a Line, behind one long Tree, I ad-
vis'd them all to light, and keeping that Tree be-
fore us, for a Breaft-Work, to ftand in a Trian-
gle, or three Fronts, enclofmg our Horfes in the
Center.
We did fo, and it was well we did j for never
was a more furious Charge than the Creatures
made upon us in the Place; they came on us with
a growling kind of aNoife and mounted the Piece
of Timber, (which as Ifaid, was our Breatt-Work)
as if they were only rulhtng upon their Prey} and
this Fury of theirs, it fcems, was principally occa-
fion'd by their feeing our Horfes b•eliind us, which
was the Prey they aim'd at: I order'd our Men to
fire as before, every other Man; and they took
their Aim fo fure, that indeed they kill'd fcveral of
the Wolves at the firft Volley} but there was a
NecdTity to keep a continual Firing; for they
came on like Devils, thofe behind pufhing on
thofe before.
When we had fir'd our fecond Volley of ourFu-
fees, we thought they ftopp'd a little, and I hop'd
they would have gone offj but it was but a Mo-
ment; for others came forward again; fo we fir'd
two Volleys of our Pittols, and 1 believe in thefe
four Firings, we had kill'd feventeen or eighteen of
them, and lum'd twice as many; yet they came on
again.
I was loath to fpend our laft Shot too haftily; fb
I call'd my Servant, not my Man Friday^ for he was
better employ'dj for with the greateft. Dexterity
imaginable, he had charg'd my Fufee", and his
own, while we were engag'd; but as I faid, I call'd
my other Man, and giving him a Horn of Powder,
I bad him lay a Train, all along the Piece of Tim-
ber, and let it be a large Train; he did fo, and had,
but jult Time to get away, when the Wolves came
up ro it, and fome were.got up upon it; when
I lhapping an uncharged Piltol, dole to the Pow-
A a 3 der,
Icr, fet it on fire j thofe that were upon the Tim-
>cr wcrcfcorcht with it, and fix or fevcnof them
'ell, or rather jump'd in among us, with the Force
ind Fright of the Fire, we difpatch'd thefe in
in Inftant, and the reft were fo frighted with
:hc Light, which the Nighr, for it was now very
near Dark, made more terrible, that they drew
jack a Ifttle.
Upon which I order'd our laft Piftol to be fir'd
DfFin one Volley, and after that we gave a Shout;
upon this, the Wolves turn'd Tail, and we fally'd
immediately upon near twenty lame Ones, who
we found ftruggling on the Ground, and tell a cut-
ting them with our Swords, which anfwer'd our
Expectation ; for the Crying and Howling they
made, was better underftood by their Fellows, fo
that they all fled and left us.
We had, firil and laft, kilPd about three Score
of them} and had it been Day-Light, we had
kill'd many more : The Field of Battle being thus
clear'd, we made forward again; for we had ftill
near a League to go. We heard the ravenous Crea-
tures houl and yell in the Woods as we went, fe-
veral times; and fometimes we fancy'd we law
fome of them, but the Snow dazling our Eyes,
we were not certain; fo in about an Hour more,
we came to the Town, where we were to lodge,
which we found m a terrible Fright, and all in
Arms} for it feems, that the Night before, the
Wolves and fome Bears had broke into the ViUage
in the Night, and put them in a terrible Fright,
and they were oblig'd to keep Guard Night and
Day, but elpecially in the Night, to prelerve their
Cattle, and indeed their People.
The next Morning our Guide was fo ill, and his
Limbs fwell'd with the rankling of his two Wounds,

I
take a new Guide there, and go toThokufe^ where
we found a warm Climate, a fruitful pleafant Couai
try, and no SnoWj no Wolves, or any Tilling lijtfi
them; but when we told our Story at Tholoufc, they?*
told us it was nothing but what was ordinary in the
great Foreft at the Foot of the Mountains, efpeci-
ally when the Snow lay on the Ground : But they
enquir'd much what kind of a Guide we had got-
ten, that would venture to bring us that Way in
fuch a fevere Seafon; and told us, it was very much
we were not all devour'd. When we told rhem how
we plac'd our felves, and the Horfes in the Middle,
theyblam'd us exceedingly, and told us it was fifty
to one but we had been all deftroy'd; for it was the
Sight of the Horfes which made the Wolves fo fu-
rious, feeing their Prey; and that at other Times
they are really afraid of a Gun ; but the being ex.-
ceffive hungry, and raging on that Account, the
Eagernefs to come at the Horfes had made them
fenilefs of Danger; and that if we had not by the
continu'd Fire, and at laft by the Stratagem of the
Train of Powder, mafter'd them, it had been gre*t
Odds but that we had been torn to Pieces } where-
as had we been content to have fat ftill on Horfe-
back, and fir'd as Horfemen, they would not have
taken the Horfes for fo much their own, when Men
were on their Backs, as otherwife ; and withal
they told us, that at laft, if we had ftood all toge-
ther, and left our Horfes, they would have been fo
eager to have devour'd them, that we might have
come off fafe, efpecially having our Fire Arms in
our Hands, and being fo many in Number.
For my Part, 1 was never fo fenfibie of Danger
in my Life j for feeing above three hundred Devils
come roaring and open-mouth'd to devour us, and
having nothing to fhelter us, or retreat to, 1 gave

: fafe about me, the Bills of Exchange which I
i^ht with me having been very currently paid.
/fv principal Guide, and Privy Counfellor, was
good ancient Widow, who in Gratitude for the
ney I had fent her, thought no Pains too much,
xu e too great, to employ for me} 'and I trutted
fo entirely with every Thing, that I was per-
ly cafy as to the Security of my Effects; and in-
j, I was very happy from my Beginning, and
i to the End, in the unlpotted Integrity of this
d Gentlewoman.

I refolv'd to ftay at Home, and if I could find
Means for it, to difpoie of my Plantation.
To this Purpofe I wrote to my old Friend at
Lisbnn, who in Return gave me Notice, that he
could e.ifily difpofe of it there: But that if I
thought fit to give him Leave to offer it in my
Name to the two Merchants, the Survivors of my
Truliees, who liv'd in the Urafils, who murt fully
underfland the Value of it, who liv'd juftupon the
Spot, and who I knew were very rich, fo that he
belicv'd they would be fon i of buying it$ he did
rot doubt, but I fhould make 4 or j-ooo Pieces of
Eight, the more of it.
Accordingly I agreed, gave him Order to offer
it to them, and he did fo^f and in about 8 Months
more, the Ship being then icturn'd, he fent me an
Account, that they had accepted the Offer, and
hud remitted 33000 Pieces of Eight, to a Cor-
relpondent of theirs at Lisbon, to pay for it.
In Return, 1 fign'd the Instrument of Sale in the
Form which they fent from Lisbon^ and fent it to
my old Man, who fent me Bills of Exchange for
328000 Pieces ot Eight to me, for the Eftate j re-
Icrving the Payment of 100 Moidores a Year to
him, the old Man, during his Life, and fo Moi-
dores afterwards to his Son for his Life, which I
had promifed them, which the Plantation was to
make good as a Rent-Charge. And thus I have
given the firft Part of a Life of Fortune and Ad-
venture, a Life of Providence's Checquet-Work,
and of a Variety which the World will feldom be
able to (hew the like of: Beginning foolifhly, but
clofing much more happily than any Part of it ever
gave me Leave fo much as to hope for.
Any one would think, that in this State of com-
plicated good Fortune, I was pall running any
more Hazards} and fo indeed I had been, if other
Cir-
:um fiances had concurr'd, but I was inur'd to
andringLife, had no Family, not many Rela-
is, flor however Rich had I contracted much Ac-
intance} and though 1 had fold my Ettate in
Bra/Us, yet I could not keep the Country out
ny Head, and had a great Mind to be upon
Wing again, efpecially I could not refift the
>ng Inclination I had to fee my Ifhnd, and to
»w if'the poor Spaniards were in Being there,
how the Rogues I left there had ufed them.
Ay true Friend, the Widow, earneftly difwa-
me frorrj it, and fo fur prevaiFd with me, that
almoft feven Years {he prevented my running
sad i during whichfctime, I took my two
phews, the Children of one of my Brothers,
> my Care : The eldelt having fomething of
own, I bred up as a Gentleman, and gave
i a Settlement of fome Addition to his Elhte,
:r my Deceafej the other I put out to a Cap-
i of a Ship} and after five Years, finding
i a fenfible bold enterprizing young Fellow, I
him into a good Ship, and fent him to Sea:
i this young Fellow afterwards drew me in, as
as I was, to farther Adventures my felf.
n the mean time, 1 in part fettled my felf here:
firft of all I marry'd, and that not either to my
advantage or Diflatisfa&ion, and had three
ildren, two Sons and one Daughter : But my
fe dying, and my Nephew coming Home with
id Succefs from a Voyage to Spain, my Inclina-
i to go abroad, and his Importunity prevailed
engag'd me to go in his Ship, as a private Trader,
he Eafl-Indies: This was in the Year i<5p4.

into, as full of Variety and wonderful Accidents,
as my own Part, particularly alfo as to their Battles
with the Carribeans, who landed feveral times
upon the Ifland, and as to the Improvement they
made upon the Ifland ic felf, and how five of
them made an Attempt upon the main Land,
and brought away eleven Men and five Women
Prifoners, by which, at my coming, I found about
twenty young Children on the Ifland.
Here I ftay'd about zo Days, left them Sup-
plies of all neceflary things, and particularly of
Arms, Powder, Shot, Cloaths, Tools, and two
Workmen, which I brought from England with
me, viz. a Carpenter and a Smith.
Befides this, I fhard the Ifland into Parts with
'em, referv'd to my felf the Property of the whole,
but gave them fuch Parts respectively as they a-
greed on} and having fettled all things with them,
and engaged them not to leave the Place, I left
them there.
From thence I touch'd at the Braftls, from whence
I fent a Bark, which 1 bought there, with more
People to the Ifland, and in it, befides other Sup-
plies, I fent feven Women, being fuch as I found
proper for Service, or for Wives to fuch as would
take them: As to the Englijh Men, I promis'd them
to fend them fome Women from England^ with a
good Cargoe of Ncceflaries, if they would apply
themfclves to Planting, which I afterwards per-
form'd. And the Fellows prov'd very honeft
and diligent after they were mafter'd, and had
their Properties fee apart for them. I fent them
alfo
ing big with Calf, fome Sheep, and fome Hogs,
•which, when I came again, were confiderably en-
creas'd.
But all thefe things, with an Account how 300
Caribbecs came and invaded them, and ruin'd their
Plantations, and how they fought with that whole
Number twice, and were at firft defeated, and
three of them kill'd ; but at laft a Storm deiiroying
their Enemies Cannoes, they famifh'd or deltrcy'd
almoiT all the reft, and renew'd and recover'd the
Pofleffion of their Plantation, and flill liv'd upon
the Ifland.
All thefe things, with fome very furprizing In-
cidents m fome new Adventures of my own, for ten
Years more, I may perhaps give a farther Account
of hererafter.
