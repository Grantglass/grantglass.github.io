BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH
0F
DANIEL DEFOE.
Tun author of Robinson Crusoe would be entitled to a prominent
place in the history of our literature, even had he never given to
the world that truly admirable production; and yet we may
reasonably question whether the name of Defoe would not long
ago have sunk into oblivion, or at least have been known, like
those of most of his contemporaries, only to the curious student,
were it not attached to a work whose popularity has been rarely
equalled—never, perhaps, excelled. Even as it is, the reputation
due to the writer has been nearly altogether absorbed in that of
his hero, and in the all-engrossing interest of his adventures:
thousands who have read Robinson Crusoe with delight, and
derived from it a. satisfaction in no wise diminished by repeated
perusal, have never bestowed a. thought on its author, or. indeed,
regarded it in the light of a. literary performance.
fascination has been universally felt, the genius that conceived it,
the talent that perfected it, have been generally overlooked,
merely because it is so full of nature and reality as to exhibit no
invention or exertion on the part of the author, inasmuch as he
appears simply to have recorded what actually happened, and
consequently only to have committed to paper plain matter of
fact, without study or embellishment. We wonder at and are
struck with admiration by the powers of Shakspeare or Cervantes;
with regard to Defoe we experience no similar feelings: it is not
the skill of the artist that enchants us, but the perfect naturalness
of the picture, which is such that we mistake it for a mirror' so
While at.
/
that every reader persuades himself that he could write as Well,
perhaps better, were be but furnished with the materials for an
equally interesting narrative.
There are many circumstances in Defoe's own history that
would recommend it to the notice of the biographer, indepen-
dently of his claims as the author of Robinson: among which
are the variety and extraordinary number of. his literary per-
formances, amounting to no fewer than two hundred and nine
different publications; and the no less singular fact that the
X BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH 07
species of composition, but was not produced till he was far
advanced in years, be having then arrived at a period of life when
the generality of anti ors close their literary career, and when the
powers of imaginat' n either lose much of their vigour, or become
altogether torpid. Nor will our surprise at Defoe's industry, and
the almost unp cedented fertility of his pen, be at all diminished
by considering that he was not a recluse student or professed
scholar, but was engaged in trade and various other speculations.
In one respect, however, his mercantile occupations contributed
to lay the foundation of his excellence as a novel-writer, since
there can be little doubt that it is to his actual experience of the
sea, and his acquaintance with other countries, we are indebted
for that truth and spirit which animate the more interesting parts
X BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH 07
earnestness, and fund of native intelligence, have placed him
very far above those who presume to undervalue his literary
acquirements.
According to the latest and most copious of all his biographers,
Daniel Defoe was born in 1661, two years earlier than the
generally assigned date of his birth. His father was a butcher
in the parish of St. Giles, Cripplegate ; and appears to have been
a citizen in easy circumstances, although his trade was one that
confers no particular lustre on a pedigree. It is usual to affect
some degree of astonishment when we read of men whose after
fame presents a striking contrast to the humility of their origin :
yet we must recollect that it is not ancestry and splendid descent,
but education and circumstances which form the man; and in
this respect the middling classes possess a decided advantage over
those either below or above them: for if the former are precluded
from cultivating their talents and abilities, the latter generally
consider themselves exempt from the necessity of doing so, and


ll
DANIIL DEFOE. ll
accordingly content themselves with cultivating mere external
accomplishments, in preference to exercising their mental ener-
gies. Those on the contrary who are placed in a middle station,
while they are not debnrred from the means of application, feel
that stimulus to exertion which arises from the desire of acquiring
fortune or fame. The history of such men as Ximenes, Wolsey,
Alberoni, and Napoleon, may, indeed, justly excite our wonder;
—when, too, we behold unlettered genius emerging, in spite
of every obstacle, from the obscurity to which it seemed con-
demned, as in a Fergusson, a Duval, a Burns, and an Opie, we,
may be permitted to express our astonishment; but as regards
his origin, the history of Defoe is that of thousands who have
afterwards raised themselves into comparative elevation by the
display of their powers. The solicitude, therefore, so generally
displayed by biographers, on similar occasions, to trace some
DANIIL DEFOE. ll
those whose native obscurity seems to demand some apology,
betrays a rather mistaken policy. However this may be, it is
certain that it is quite as honourable for Defoe to have ascended
from a butcher as it would have been to have descended from the
Conqueror himself.
One undoubted and very great advantage, for which Defoe
was indebted to his parents, who were Nonconformists, was an
education superior to what it was then usual for persons in their
station to bestow upon their children; and they were careful
also to implant in his youthful mind that regard for religion, and
that strict moral integrity, which afterwards displayed themselves
not only in his writings, but his conduct through life. And this
rectitude of principle he most unequivocally evinced when his
misfortunes put it so severely to the proof. At about the age of
fourteen, he was placed under the tuition of the Rev. Charles
Morton, of Newington Green, who was afterwards vice—president
of Harvard College, New England; and from various incidental
remarks in his own works, it appears that young Defoe now
entered upon an extensive course of studies, and made consider-
DANIIL DEFOE. ll
and theology; although the natural liveliness of his disposition
DANIIL DEFOE. ll
a profound scholar in any one of those pursuits.
It was the intention of his parents tnat he should embrace
the clerical profession, which their religious feelings, and pro-
bably a very pardonable ambition, induced them to select for
Xll. BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH OI
was unwilling to embrace it himself; or events, at least, diverted
his talents into another channel. The political and religious
excitements of that period were contagious for one of Defoe's
temper: he assumed the character of the patriot as soon as be
cast off that of the boy, and espoused the side of the. popular
party with all the ardour of youth; nor was it long before he
had opportunities of distinguishing himself. He was a warm
advocate for the Bill of Exclusion, passed by the Commons to
prevent the succession of the Duke of York to the throne; and
regarded with abhorrence that spirit of despotism which sen-
Xll. BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH OI
of twenty-one he commenced author, which employment be con—
tinued for nearly half a century, and that, too, almost uninter-
ruptedly, notwithstanding his various speculations of a different
nature. It cannot be expected that in a sketch of this nature
we should attempt to give anything like a connected account of
Defoe’s various literary performances, they being too numerous
and multifarious for us to advert to them separately, even if we
conceived that by so doing we should greatly interest the readers
of this—the most distinguished of them all. But the truth is, i
the majority of them are of that class which it is rather the
province of the bibliographer than the critic to describe. We

which, under the singular title of “Speculum Crape-gownorum,"
was a reply to a publication of Roger L’Estrange’s, a noted party
writer of that day. In this work Defoe indulged in rather in-
temperate language, and while vindicating the dissenters, re-
Xll. BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH OI
established clergy. This was succeeded by a “Treatise against
the Turks," occasioned by the war between them and the Im-
perialists; and was penned by Defoe for the purpose of showing
his countrymen that, if it was the interest of Protestantism not

more so to oppose a Mahommedan one; which, however debate-
able it might appear to politicians, was almost too obvious at
truism to be entitled to any merit for its sagacity. It is the fate
of political publications quickly to fall into oblivion after the
events which call them forth have passed away; the reputation
deriVed from them is as transitory as the events themselves, or if
the fame of the writer occasionally descends to posterity, it is
DANIEL DEFOE. xiu
Shortly after this, Defoe proved that he was as ready to
support the doctrines he advocated by the sword as by the pen :
he accordingly joined the standard of the Duke of Monmouth,
when the latter landed in England with the view of expelling a
Catholic prince from the throne, and seating himself upon it as
the defender of protestantism. The issue of that adventure, and
the subsequent fate of the unfortunate, if not perfectly innocent,
Monmouth are well known. Happier than the leader of the
enterprise, it was Defoe's better luck to escape: he returned to
the metropolis in safety; and, abandoning politics and warfare,
was content for a while to turn his attention to the more humble
but less stormy pursuits of trade
He now became a hosier, or rathera hose-factor, that is, a kind
of agent between the manufacturer and retailer; and, according to
Mr. Chalmers, he continued to carry on this concern from 1685 to
1695. It was about two years after he had thus established him-
self, that he was admitted a liveryman of London,on the 26th of
January, 1687-8. Business, however, did not 0 entirely absorb
his attention but that he found time to engage in the various
controversies that agitated the public mind, and which were
occasioned by the arbitrary measures of James, who, feeling himself
secure after the removal of so dangerous an enemy as Monmouth,
began more openly to favour the Catholics, and to dispense with'
the tests intended to prevent their accepting commissions in the
army. This of course excited both the alarm and indignation
of the Protestants, which were by no means allayed by the
temporizing servility of their own clergy, who exerted their elo-
quence in favour of the king's prerogative. Among those who
attacked the doctrine of the dispensing power was Defoe; nor, as
may well be imagined, was he afterwards an unconcerned spectator
of the Revolution, whose progress he had minutely watched, and
whose anniversary he continued yearly ‘o celebrate as a' day
marked by the deliverance of his country from political and
religious tyranny. His attachment to the new sovereign was con»
DANIEL DEFOE. xiu
his consort; for the “butcher's son " had had the honour of an
early introduction to the roval presence.
At this period Defoe resided at Tooting in Surrey, and he had
now launched out into more extensive commercial speculations,
I
having embarked in the Spanish and Portuguese trade, so that he
might fairly claim the title of merchant. The precise time of his
going to Spain, whether before or after the Revolution, cannot be
ascertained; but he not only made a voyage thither, but stayed
some time in the country, and acquired a knowledge of the
language. Sincere as was his attachment to the purer tenets of
protestantism, it did not degenerate into blind prejudice, nor pre-
vent him from doing justice to catholics: he has accordingly, in
his Robinson Crusoe, represented the Spanish character under its
most amiable traits, and in a tone that may almost pass for
panegyric. This voyage, as we have already remarked, doubt—
lessly contributed to store his observant mind with many materials
for those descriptions of the perils and adventures common to a
seafaring life, that so strongly excite the sympathy of those who
follow his hero across the trackless deep. Nor was he without
some experience of shipwreck, if not actually in his own person,
by the loss of a vessel in which he was a shareholder, and which
was wrecked in a violent storm off the coast of Biscay. It was
about this period also that he traded with Holland; probably for
civet, as one of his enemies has sneeringly styled him a “ civet-
cat merchant.” Besides this he visited some other parts of the
continent, particularly Germany : he did not, however, relinquish
his hose~agency business in consequence of his other engagements.
But commercial enterprise did not prove for him the road to
wealth: on the contrary, his speculations involved him in such
embarrassments, that, in 1692, he was obliged to abscond from
his creditors. A commission of bankruptcy was taken out against
him, yet it was afterwards superseded, those to whom he was most
in debt agreeing to accept a composition on his own bond; and
he not only punctually discharged these claims, but, after he had
somewhat retrieved his circumstances, voluntarily repaid the
remainder. This is so much the more to his honour, since so far
from having met with many precedents of similar prohity in
others, his misfortunes had been in some degree occasioned by
the knavery of unprincipled men, who, availing themselves of the
impunity held out to them by the supineness or the impotency of

legislature to the intolerable abuses which arose from those
sanctuaries, as they were termed, for criminals and debtors, which
then existed in the metropolis; and to him, consequently, may
we be said to be indebted for the abatement of a nuisance as dis-
graceful to the national character, as it was injurious to the indus-
trious and honest portion of the community.
With the view of assisting him in his distress, some of his
friends now came forward and offered to settle him as a factor
at Cadiz: yet, advantageous as the proposal was, he declined it,

country being then engaged in an expensive war with France,
Defoe proposed a scheme to assist the government in raising
“ the ways and means ;” and some time afterwards he received
the appointment of accountant to the commissioners of the glass
duty; but it proved only a temporary one, as the duty was
repealed in August, 1699. Probably it was also about the same
period that he became secretary to the tile-works at Tilbury, in
which concern he embarked some money, and was again a suf-
ferer. His “ Essay on Projects," published in January, 1696-7,
shows him to have been, if not a very successful speculator him-
self, at least a very ingenious and fertile deviser of theoretical
plans, most of which must be allowed to have the welfare of

celebrated Franklin, who confesses that the impressions he received
from it gave a strong bias to his own pursuits.
If not invariably employed in the active defence of public
morals, Defoe’s pen was too honest to betray their interests on
any occasion : it was not always that his topics called for, or even
admitted, any direct inculcations of virtue, but whenever they
did, he displayed his earnestness in its behalf. His publication
entitled “ The Poor Man’s Plea" is a very keen piece of satire,
with a considerable touch of humour, levelled against the vices of
the upper classes of society, in which he urges them to discoun-
tenance by their own conduct:_ the immorality they deem so
reprehensible in the vulgar. The stage too did not escape his
castigation; and really its transgressions were at that period so
barefaced and audacious, so offensive even to common decency,
that, whatever infamy there may have been in either tolerating
or in attempting to defend such a system of lewdness, there could
XVI B!0GRAPBICAL SZEI‘CH 01'
be no great triumph in exposing that which did not even attempt
to conceal itself.
We have now to notice our author in a somewhat different
character—namely, as a. candidate for poetical fame. His satire,
entitled the “ Trueborn Englishman," which was written for
XVI B!0GRAPBICAL SZEI‘CH 01'
upon him as a foreigner, had indeed a very great run at the time
—-more, however, on account of the matter than of the manner
-—since both that and all Defoe’s other attempts of the kind
convince us, that, like the great Roman orator, he was an intole-
XVI B!0GRAPBICAL SZEI‘CH 01'
gratitude and enthusiastic devotion to his prince have supplied
that inspiration which the muses denied him, Defoe’s poetry
XVI B!0GRAPBICAL SZEI‘CH 01'
admiration of, so zealous was his devotion to, William III. The
various effusionsin rhyme, and the numerous political pamphlets
and tracts which he published at this interval, we must pass by,
and come directly to an event that obtained for our author a
rather unenviable species of distinction. The reign of Anne
commenced with much violence and with cabals between the
respective church parties, leading to controversies that rather
fanned than allayed the public ferment. On such an occasion,
it was not to be expected that Defoe would remain passive:
assuming the furious tone of the high-churchmen of the day
against the dissenters, he published a small pamphlet, which was
in reality a satire upon the writings which that party had issued
XVI B!0GRAPBICAL SZEI‘CH 01'
exact, that while it was supposed by them to utter the real senti-
ments of the writer, it was also interpreted by those whom it
was intended to serve as coming from a violent enemy. The
“ Shortest Way with the Dissenters"—-such was its title—created
an amazing sensation; and on its real object being exposed,

they had before been warm in their applause. The author
‘was detected, a reward offered for his apprehension, and he
himself sentenced to be imprisoned in Newgate, and to stand
in the pillory; but the attendance of his friends, and the enthu-
siasm of the populace in favour of the champion of religious
liberty, converted an ignorninious punishment into a triumph,
so that his enemies had as little reason to exult in their victory,
as to be proud of the sagacity they had displayed. If, however.
nmru. oaror. xvii
thi event rather increased than diminished Defoe’s reputation,
nmru. oaror. xvii
ment in Newgate prevented his attending any longer to his con-
cern at Tilbury, the consequence of which was that it was obliged
to be given up; and thus Defoe saw-himself deprived at once of
what had been the source of a handsome income, for before this
affair he was in such thriving circumstances as to be able to keep
his coach. According to his own statement, he lost three thousand
nmru. oaror. xvii
than it would be now. There was indeed one way of both speedily
nmru. oaror. xvii
tures made him by the ministry, who would gladly have enlisted
in their own cause that pen which had proved so powerful against
them : but Defoe was too independent of soul, and too high-prin-
cipled, to purchase his release upon terms that would inflict upon
him the disgrace the pillory had failed to effect.
Although a prison is not the most congenial place for literary
pursuits, our author availed himself of the time which the loss of
his liberty afforded him, of occupying his unwelcome leisure from
all other business in writing both in verse and prose. It was here
that he published his poem on the “ Reformation of Manners," a
nmru. oaror. xvii
the subject in another, entitled “ More Reformation ;" in which he
alludes to his own situation in the following nervous lines, de-
scribing himself as
“ A modern too],
To wit, to parties and himself a fool;
Embroil’d with states to do himself no good,
And by his friends themselves misunderstood:
nmru. oaror. xvii
By these unpitied, and by those unpaid."
Here we may truly sayfacit indignatio versus, for the caustic tone
and antithesis are not unworthy of Pope himself. The political
controversial pieces which he sent forth to the world from his
“ place of durance vile " were too numerous for us to specify
them : we therefore prefer speaking of a work 'of more permanent
interest, one in which he may be regarded as the immediate pre-
decessor of two of the most popular and admired of our classic
writers in the days of Anne—namely, Steele and Addison. Defoe's
“ Review," which commenced Feb. 19, 1704, deserves to be con-
sidered as the prototype of our Tatlers and Spectators; and may
earn for its author the appellation of the Father of English
xviii moo nanncn. sxrrcn or
Essayists: since notwithstanding that political intelligence an
discussion constituted a great portion of its contents, it touche
upon a variety of other topics bearing upon literature, manner:
and morals; while it was itself hardly in any degree indebted to
this part of its plan to preceding or contemporary publications
Uniformly assailing vice, or exposing to just ridicule the follie.
and foibles of society, Defoe varied his mode of attack, at cm
time employing grave reasoning and serious remonstrance; at
another, substituting sarcasm, humour, wit, and pleasantry, for
monitory reproof. To a modern reader, indeed, many of the topics
might seem to lack invention, and to be rather commonplace,
merely because they have been so repeatedly handled by later
writers, that both the wit and argument displayed in them have
lost their freshness. This circumstance, however, does not detract
from Defoe's intrinsic merit, or from the praise due to him as an
originator: on the contrary, he, in this respect, only shares the
fate common to all those who open a new path in literature or art,
inviting imitators whose numbers oppress, if they do not over-
whelm them: that Defoe has not since been surpassed in this

" Giving Alms no Charity," in which he displays great practical

Besides this, he proposed several plans for encouraging the
manufactures, and for promoting the trade, wealth, and maritime
resources of Scotland. After an absence of about sixteen months,

through the persevering intrigues of the duchess of Marlborough,
whom he had supplanted in the queen’s favour, an event that
suddenly overclouded Defoe's political prospects. Without com-
promising his principles, however, he espoused the interest of the
lucceeding ministry; but although Godolphin treated him with
consideration, he suffered his pension to fall into arrears, perhaps
in :onsequence of Defoe's long absence in Scotland, whither he
Ill again despatched a few months afterwards, upon some secret
is
business. In the following year, 1709, Defoe published a work
which, to use the words of an eminent living critic, “ places him
amongst the soundest historians of the day," and which, accord-
ing to the testimony of another, would have handed down his
name to posterity, even had he not immortalized himself by
Robinson Crusoe. This was his “ History of the Union," which
is as interesting for the minute descriptions it gives of the actors
and incidents in. that important event, as for the documents it
furnishes.
Still engaged in politics, Defoe’s continued and severe attacks
against the Tories and high-church party so exasperated them,
that they attempted to suppress his writings, and even threatened
him with prosecutions: their animosity, however, did not procure
for him, from those whose cause he defended, a degree of favour
and support at all commensurate with his long and able services.
He had also to contend with fresh pecuniary losses in some con-
cern in which he was engaged (1712) with Mr. Wood, a mercer
of Coleshill in Warwickshire, and with the personal abuse with

him as being a knavish bankrupt. But his political career was
now drawing to its close: having carried on his “Review”
IX BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH 01"
when he was again a prisoner in Newgate upon an indictment
preferred against him by his friends the Whigs, as the author of
three treasonable Jacobitical pamphlets; whereas the publications
in question were of a directly opposite tendency. The queen
once more bestowed a free pardon on him, and the malice of his
numerous enemies was defeated. From this time he employed
his pen only occasionally on political subjects. By the accession
of George I. to the throne, Defoe gained nothing, although his
writings had strenuously pleaded the cause of the House of
Hanover during the late reign; and although he had superior
claims upon public gratitude for the zeal with which, during
nearly thirty years, he had not only advocated religious and
political independence, but endeavoured to call attention to sub-
jects of paramount importance to the national prosperity. That
this neglect should, in spite of all his philosophy, have occasioned

and to the effect it had upon his health was attributed at:
apoplectic attack in the year 1715, from which he continued tx
suffer for six months.
After so serious a blow to his constitution, and at his advanced
period of life, it might have been expected that he would now
lay aside his pen,--at least remit in his exertions. Yet it was
subsequently to this apparently cloudy epoch of his career that
the brightest and most durable of his literary wreaths was won.
Great versatility of talent is not often accompanied by an equal
degree of vigour and raciness of intellect; when, however, such
does happen to be the case, it should seem that the former is

of subject serves to recruit the mental energies. Defoe at least
may be quoted as an extraordinary instance of rqiuvenescency
of mind in the decline of years. We do not here allude to his
“Family Instructor," although that performance is one of the
most valuable and useful systems of practical morality in our lan-
DANIEL DEFOE. and
than many works of even splendid celebrity. It is the_series'
of novels which now appear in quick succession from his pen,
that have won for him an imperishable reputation among the
worthies of English literature: nor will his claims upon our
admiration be diminished by considering the extravagant, unna-
tural system of romance-writing which had till then prevailed,
DANIEL DEFOE. and
a glimpse of real life was to be discerned. In Defoe’s narratives,
on the contrary, there is such an air of downright matter-of-fact
and unadorned truth, as to amount to actual deception; thereby
preventing us from crediting the author with any merit on the
score of imagination, contrivance, or invention. Of this the
reader will be amply convinced by the perusal of the present
work, on which it is not necessary that we should expatiate, and
we shall therefore merely advert to the circumstances connected
with its origin and publication. The History of Robinson Crusoe

said to have been established immediately, since four editions
were called for in about as many months, a circumstance at that
time almost unprecedented in the annals of literature. It rarely
happens that an author's expectations are surpassed by the success
of his work, however astonishing it may seem to others : yet per:
haps even Defoe himself did not venture to look forward to such
a welcome on the part of the public, after the repulses he had
experienced on that of the booksellers; for incredible as it now

reJected by, every one in the trade, in which respect its destiny
was not only similar to that of Paradise Lost, but of two of the
most celebrated literary productions of the present day, namely,
Waverley and Childe Harold; the former of which remained in
manuscript ten years, without any probability of ever seeing the
light, although its fame has since extended itself wherever the
English language is known—nay more, has even penetrated the
wilds of Siberia.
Astonishing as was the success of Defoe's romance, it did not
deter the envious from attempting to disparage it. The materials,
it was said, were either furnished by, or surreptitiously obtained
from, Alexander Selkirk, a mariner who had resided for four years
in the desert island of Juan Fernandez, and returned to England
in 1711. Very probably, his story, which then excited consider-
able interest and attention, did suggest to Defoe the idea of
writing his romance; but all the details and incidents are entirely
his own. Most certainly Defoe had obtained no papers or written
documents from Selkirk, as the latter had none to 'communicate.
So far, however, have others been from taxing our author with pla-
giarism, that they have, on the contrary, charged him with putting
on paper sheep of chimazras, to impose upon public credulity
Thus these two contradictory charges reciprocally destroy each
other. An attempt has also been made _to rob him entirely of the
brightest jewel in his literary crown, by denying him to have
been the author of Robinson Crusoe, which has been ascribed, by
8X11 BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH 0F
of Oxford. Those who have wished to gain credit for the latter
opinion, assert that it was composed by that nobleman during his
imprisonment in the Tower, in 1715, on a charge of high treason;
and they have argued that the whole tone of the work, especially
of that part towards the conclusion where an account is given of
the exiled nobles of Muscovy, is what would naturally be sug-
gested by the solitude of a prison. Yet as far as internal evidence
is concerned, that is, indisputably, much stronger in favour of
Defoe ; for he had not only been familiar with imprisonment, but
was also by his acquaintance with foreign countries, and his
8X11 BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH 0F
duce a work which displays so much practical knowledge of things,
as well as of man. Indeed, nothing short of the most conclusive
and undeniable testimony of facts to the contrary can at all
invalidate his claims to be considered as the real author. Ilad
Robinson Crusoe been the only production of the kind that
proceeded from his pen, there might be netter reason for doubting
whether he wrote it; but the various other novels, or rather

tional reason for attributing it to him.

deserve: the “ History of Moll Flanders," which was published
in 1721, is an admirably drawn picture of life, and contains an
excellent moral lesson, although many of the scenes it necessarily
discloses are coarse and revolting. ' The “ Life of Colonel J aque ”
contains also much able delineation of real life; and in that part
of the narrative which gives an' account of the hero’s residence
in Virginia, Defoe has humanely advocated the cause of the
negro slaves. His “ Memoirs of a Cavalier,” which work is sup.
posed to have been written about the same time, is rather history
attired in the form of an iamginary piece of biography, than a
romance. Indeed, all the details are so circumstantial and accu-
rate, that it has been mistaken for a genuine narrative of the
events of the civil warsiin England and Germany; and it was
actually recommended as the very best account of them
by the great Lord Chatham, with whom it was a favourite book.
In like manner our author’s “ History of the Plague " imposed
upon Dr. Mead, and since upon others, who have referred to it as
an authentic document, and a true recital of that great national
calamity. Here he is the rival of Thucydides and Boccaccio;
and depicts the horrors of pestilence as vividly and as masterly
as Poussin. It may, however, be imagined by some that this is

the features of the past in their most‘interesting, if not their most
engaging aspect.
Besides the preceding, and one or two other productions of a
similar cast, Defoe produced that very excellent and popular

in 1722, and afterwards went through numerous editions. This
and his “Family Instructor " are replete with lessons of the

any he had before experienced; and the mental anguish it
occasioned doubtless accelerated his death, which occurred on the
24th of April, 1731. Since that period more than a century has
elapsed; and in that interval many names of considerable emi-
nence in their day have sunk into irretrievable oblivion; Defoe,
also, has lost some portion of the celebrity he enjoyed with his
contemporaries: yet, after every deduction, enough remains to
entitle him to a place among the Worthies of English literature,
for should all his other productions be forgotten, his Robinson
Crusoe must remain imperishable.

lived afterwards at York; from whence he had married my
mother, whose relations were named Robinson, a very good
family in that country, and after whom I was so called, that is
to say, Robinson Kreutznaer; but, by the usual corruption of
words in England, we are now called, nay, we call ourselves,
and write our name, Crusoe; and so my companions always
called me.
I had two elder brothers, one of whom was lieutenant-colonel
to an English regiment of foot in Flanders, formerly commanded
by the famous Colonel Lockhart, and was killed at the battle
near Dunkirk against the Spaniards. What became of my
second brother, I never knew, any more than my father and
mother did know what was become of me.
Being the third son of the family, and not bred to any trade,
my head began to be filled very early with rambling thoughts.
My father, who was very aged, had given me a competent share

fatal in that propension of nature, tending directly to the life of
misery which was to befall me.
My father, a wise and grave man, gave me serious and excellent
counsel against what he foresaw was my design. He called me
2 ADVENTURES or
gout, and expostulated very warmly with me upon this subject:
he asked me what reasons, more than a mere wandering incli-
nation, I had for leaving his house, and my native country, where
I might be well introduced, and had a. prospect of raising my
fortune, by application and industry, with a life of ease and
pleasure. He told me it was men of desperate fortunes, on one
and, or of superior fortunes, on the other, who went abroad
upon adventures, aspiring to rise by enterprise, and make them-
selves famous in undertakings of a nature out of the common
road; that these things were all either too far above me, or too
far below me; that mine was the middle state, or what might be
called the upper station of low life, which he had found. by long
experience, was the best state in the world, the most suited to
human happiness; not exposed to the miseries and hardships,
the labour and sufferings, of the mechanic part of mankind, and
not embarrassed with the pride, luxury, ambition, and envy of
the upper part of mankind: he told me, I might judge of the
happiness of this state by one thing, viz. that this was the state
of life which all other people envied; that kings have frequently
lamented the miserable consequences of being born to great
things, and wished they had been placed in the middle of two
extremes, between the mean and the great; that the wise man
gave his testimony to this as the just standard of true felicity,
when he prayed to have “ neither poverty nor riches.’I
2 ADVENTURES or
calamities of life were shared among the upper and lower part of
mankind; but that the middle station had the fewest disasters,
and was not exposed to so many vicissitudes as the higher or
lower part of mankind: nay, they were not subjectedto so many
distempers and uneasinesses, either of body or mind, as those
were, who, by vicious living, luxury, and extravagancies, on one
hand, or, by hard labour, want of necessaries, and mean and

quietness, health, society, all agreeable diversions, and all desir-
able pleasures were the blessings attending the middle station of
life; that this way men went silently and smoothly through the
world, and comfortably out of it, not embarrassed with the
labours of the hands or of the head. not sold to the life of slaver
for daily bread, or harassed with perplexed circumstances, whic
rob the soul of peace, and the body of rest; not enraged with
the passion of envy, or secret burning lust of ambition for great
things; but, in easy circumstances, sliding gently through the
world, and sensibly tasting the sweets of living, without the
bitter ; feeling that they are happy, and learning by every day's
experience, to know it more sensibly
After this he pressed me earnestly, and in the most affectionate
manner, not to play the young man, nor to precipitate myself
into miseries which nature, and the station of life I was born in,
seemed to have provided vainst ; that I was under no necessity
of seeking my bread; that e would do well for me, and endea-
vour to enter me fairly into the station of life which he had been
just recommending to me ; and that if I was not very easy and
happy in the world, it must be my mere fate, or fault, that must
hinder it; and that he should have nothing to answer for, having
thus discharged his duty in warning me against measures which
he knew would be to my hurt: in a word, that as he would do
very kind things for me if I would stay and settle at home as he
directed; so he would not have so much hand in my misfortunes
as to give me any encouragement to go away: and, to close all,
he told me I had my elder brother for an exam le, to whom he
had used the same earnest persuasions to keep 'm from going
into the Low Country wars; but could not prevail, his young
desires prompting him to run into the army, where he was killed;
and though, he said, he would not cease to pray for me, yet he
would venture to say to me, that if I did take this foolish step,
God would not bless me ; and I would have leisure, hereafter, to

none to assist in my recovery.
I observed, in this last part of his discourse, which was truly
rophetic, though, I suppose, my father did not know it to be so
himself; I say, I observed the tears run down his face very
lentifully, especially when he spoke of my brother who was
' ed; and that, when he spoke of my having leisure to repent,
and none to assist me, he was so moved, that he broke off the
discourse, and told me his heart was so full, he could say no
more to me.
I was sincerely affected with this discourse; as, indeed, who
could be otherwise? and I resolved not to think of going abroad
any more, but to settle at home, according to m father's desire.
But alas! a few days Wore it all off: and, in s ort, to prevent
any of my father's further importunities, in a few weeks after I

I took my mother, at a time when I thought her a little plea-
santer than ordinary, and told her that my thoughts were so
entirely bent u on seeing the world, that I should never settle
to anything with resolution enough to go through with it, and
my father had better give me his consent than force me to go
without it; that I was now eighteen years old, which was too
late to go apprentice to a trade, or clerk to an attorney ;
that I was sure, if I did, I should never serve out my time, and
I should certainly run away from my master before my time was
out, and go to sea; and if she would speak to my father to let
me make but one voyage abroad, if I came home again, and did
not like it, I would go no more; and I would promise by a
double diligence, to recover the time I had lost.
This putm mother into a great passion: she told me she
knew it wouldrbe to no purpose to speak to my father upon any
such a subject; that he knew too well what was my interest to
give his consent to an thing so much for my hurt; and that she
wondered how I co d ink of any such thing, after such a
discourse as I had from y father, and such kind and tender
expressions 'as she knew my father had used to me; and that,
in short, if I would ruin myself, there was no help for me; but
I might depend I should never have their consent to it: that for
her part, she would not have so much hand in my destruction;
and I should never have it to say, that my mother was willing
when my father was not.
Though my mother refused to move it to m father, yet, as I
have heard afterwards, she reported all the 'scourse to him;
and that my father, after showing a great concern at it, said to
her with a sigh, That boy might be happy if he would stay at
home; but if he goes abroad, he will be the most miserable
wretch that ever was born: I can give no consent to it.
It was not till almost a year after this that I broke loose;
though in the mean time I continued obstinately deaf to all
proposals of settling to business, and frequently expostulating
with my father and mother about their being so positively deter-
mined against what they knew my inclinations prompted me to.
But being one day at Hull, whither I went casually, and without
any purpose of making an elopement at that time, and one of
my companions then going to London by sea in his father's ship,
and prompting me to go with them by the common allurement
of seafaring men, viz. that it should cost me nothing for my
passage, [consulted neither father nor mother any more, nor so
much as sent them word of it; but left them to hear of it as
the might, without asking God’s blessing, or my father's,
wit out any consideration of circumstances or consequences, and
in an ill hour, God knows.


SECTION 11.
FIRST ADVENTURES AT SEA, AND EXPERIENCE OF A MARITIME LIFE.
VOYAGE TO GUINEA.
ON the 1st September, 1661, Iwent on board a ship bound for
London. Never any young adventurer‘s misfortunes, I believe,
began younger, or continued longer, than mine. The ship had
no sooner got out of the Humber, than the wind began to blow,
and the waves to rise, in a most frightful manner; and as I had
never been at sea before, I was most inexpressibly sick in body,
ROBINSON CRUSO
what I had done, and how justly I was overtaken by the judg-
ment of Heaven, for wickedly leaving my father's house. All
the good counsels of my parents, my father’s tears, and my
mother’s entreaties, came now fresh into my mind; and my con-
science, which was not yet come to the pitch of hardness to
which it has been since, reproached me with the contempt of
advice, and the abandonment of my duty.
All this while the storm increased, and the sea, which I had
never been upon before, went very high, though nothing like
what I have seen many times since; no, nor what I saw a few
days after; but, such as it was, enough to affect me then, who
was but a young sailor, and had never known anythinv of the
matter. I expected every wave would have swallowed us up,
and that every time the ship fell down, as I thought, in the
trough or hollow of the sea, we should never rise more; and in
this agony of mind I made many vows and resolutions, that if it
would please God to spare my life this voyage, if ever I got my
foot once on dry land, I would go directly home to my father,
and never set it into a ship again while I lived; that I would
take his advice, and never run myself into such miseries as these
any more. Now I saw plainly the goodness of his observations
aboutthe middle station of life; how easy, how comfortable, he
had lived all his days, and never had been ex osed to tempests
at sea or troubles on shore; and I resolved t at I would, like I
true 'repenting prodigal, go home to my father.
These wise and sober thoughts continued durin the storm,
and indeed some time after; but the next day, as e wind was
abated, and the sea calmer, I began to be a little inured to it. t
However, I was very grave that day, being also a little sea-sick
still: but towards night the weather cleared up, the wind was

own perfectly clear, and rose so the next morning; and having
little or no wind, and a smooth sea, the sun shining upon it, the
sight was, as I thought, the most delightful that I eVer saw.
I had slept well in the night, and was now no more sea-sick,
but very cheerful, looking with wonder upon the sea that was so
rough and terrible the day before, and could be so calm and
pleasant in a little time after.
And now, lest my good resolutions should continue, my com-
panion, who had indeed enticed me away, came to me, and said,
Well, Bob, clapping me on the shoulder, how do you do after it?
Iwarrant you you were frightened, wa'n’t you, last night, when
it blew but a cap-full of wind '.'—A cap-full, do you call it? said
I; ’twas a. terrible storm.—A storm, you fool! replies he, do you
call that a storm? Why, it was nothing at all; give us but a
good ship, and sea-room, and we think nothing of such a squall
of wind as that: you are but a fresh-water sailor,vBob; come,
let us make a bowl of punch, and we’ll forget all that. D'ye see
what charming weather ’tis now? To make short this sad part
of my story, we went the way of all sailors; the punch was
made, and I was made drunk with it; and in that one night’s

my past conduct, and all my resolutions for the future. In a
word, as the sea was returned to its smoothness of surface and
settled calmness by the abatement of the storm, so the hurry of
my thoughts being over, my fears and apprehensions of being
swallowed up by the sea forgotten, and the current of my former
desires returned, I entirely forgot the vows and promises I had

again sometimes; but I shook them off and roused myself from
them, as it were from a distemper, and, applying myself to drink

victory over conscience as any young sinner, that resolved not to
be troubled with it, could desire. But I was to have another
trial for it still; and Providence, as in such cases generally it
/—\ does, resolved to leave me entirely without excuse: for if I would
not take this for a deliverance, the next was to be such a one as
the worst and most hardened wretch among us would confess
both the danger and the mercy of. The sixth day of our being
at sea we came into Yarmouth Roads; the wind having been
contrary and the weatner calm, we had made but little way since
the storm. Here we were obliged to come to an anchor, and
here we lay, the wind continuing contrary, viz. at south-west,
for seven or eight days, during which time a great many ships
from Newcastle came into the same roads, as the common har-
bour where the ships might wait for a wind for the river Thames.
We hadnot, however, rid here so long, but we should have tided
up the river, but that the wind blew too fresh; and, after we

being reckoned as good as a harbour, the anchorage good, and
our ground tackle very strong, our men were unconcerned, and
not in the least apprehensive of danger, but spent the time in
rest and mirth, after the manner of the sea. But the eighth day,
m the morning, the wind increased, and we had all hands at
work to strike our topmasts, and make everything snug and
close, that the ship might ride as easy as possible. By noon the
sea went very high indeed, and our ship rode forecastle in,
shi ped several seas, and we thought, once or twice, our anchor
ha come home; upon which our master ordered out the sheet
anchor; so that we rode with two anchors ahead, and the cables
veered out to the better end.
By this time it blew a terrible storm indeed; and now I began
to see terror and amazement in the faces of even the seamen
themselves. The master was vigilant in the business of preserv-
ing the ship; but, as he went in and out of his cabin by me, I
could hear him softly say to himself several times, Lord, be
merciful to us! we shall be all lost; we shall be all undone! and

himself came by me, as I said just now, and said we should be
all lost, I was dreadfully frightened. I got up out of my cabin,
and looked out; but such a dismal sight I never saw; the sea
went mountains high, and broke upon us every three or four
minutes. When I could look about, I could see nothing but
distress around us; two ships, that rid near us, we found had
cut their masts by the board, being deeply laden; and our men
cried out that a ship, which rid about a mile ahead of us, was
foundered. Two more ships being driven from their anchors,

came close by us, running away, with only their spritsails out,
before the wind. Toward evening, the mate and boatswain
begged the master of our ship to let them cut away the fore-
mast, which he was very loath to do; but the boatswain pro-
testing to him, that if he did not, the ship would founder, he
consented; and when they had cut away the foremast, the
mainmast stood so loose, and shook the ship so much, they
were obliged to cut it away also, and make a clear deck.
' Any one may judge what a condition 1 must be in at all this,
who was but a oung sailor, and who had been in such a fright
before at but a ittle. But if I can express, at this distance, the
thoughts I had about me at that time, I was in tenfold more
horror of mind upon account of my former convictions, and the
having returned from them to the resolutions I had wickedly

terror of the storm, put me into such a condition, that I can by
no words describe it; but the worst was not come yet; the storm
continued with such fury, that the seamen themselves acknow-
ledged they had never known a worse. We had a good ship, but
she was deep laden, and so wallowed in the sea, that the seamen
every now and then cried out she would founder. It was my
advantage, in one respect, that I did not know what they meant
by founder, till I inquired. However, the storm was so violent,
that I saw what is not often seen, the master, the boatswain,
and some others, more sensible than the rest, at their prayers,
and expecting every moment the ship would go to the bottom.
In the middle of the night, and under all the rest of our dis-
tresses, one of the men, that had been down on purpose to see,
cried out, we had sprung a leak; another said there was four
feet water in the hold. Then all hands were called to the pump.
At that very word my heart, as I thought, died within me, and
I fell backwards upon the side of my bed, where I sat in the
cabin. However, the men roused me, and told me that I, who
was able to do nothing before, was as well able to pump as
another: at which I stirred up and went to the pump, and
worked very heartily. While this was doing, the master seeing
some light colliers, who, not able to ride out the storm, were
obliged to slip and run away to sea, and would not come near

nothing what that meant, was so surprised, that I thought the
ship had broke, or some dreadful thing had happened. In a
word, I was so surprised, that I fell down in a swoon. As this
was a time when everybody had his own life to think of, no one
minded me, or what was become of me: but another man
stepped up to the pump, and thrusting me aside with his foot,
let me lie, thinking I had been dead; and it was a great while
before I came to myself.

guns for help; and a light ship, who had rid it out just ahead
of us, ventured a boat out to help us. It was with the utmost
hazard the boat came near us, but it was impossible for us to
get on board, or for the boat to lie near the ship's side; till at
last the men rowing very heartily, and venturing their lives to
save ours, our men cast them a rope over the stern with a buoy
to it, and then veered it out a great length, which they, after
great labour and hazard, took hold of, and we hauled them close
under our stern, and got all into their boat. It was to no pur¢
ose for them or us, after we were in the boat,‘to think of reach-
mg their own ship; so all agreed to let her drive, and only to
pull her in towards shore as much as we could: and our master
promised them, that if the boat was staved upon shore, he would
make it good to their master; so partly rowing, and partly
driving, our boat went away to the northward, sloping towards
the shore almost as far as Winterton-Ness.

acknowledge, I had hardly eyes to look up when the seamen
told me. she was sinking; for, from that moment, they rather
put me into the boat, than that I might be said to go in. My
eart was, as it were, dead within me, partly with fright, partly
with horror of mind, and the thoughts of what was yet befOre
me.
While we were in this condition, the men yet labouring at the
oar to bring the boat near the shore, we could see (when, our
boat mounting the waves, we were able to see the shore) a
great many people running along the strand, to assist us when
we should come near; but we made slow way towards the
shore; nor were we able to reach it, till, being past the light-
house at Winterton, the shore falls off to the westward, towards
Cromer, and so the land broke off a little the violence of the

- Had I now had the sense to have gone back to Hull, and
have gone home, I had been happy: and my father, an emblem
of our blessed Saviour‘s parable, had even killed the fatted
calf for me 5 for, hearing the ship I went in was cast away in
10 ‘ anvmuaas or
Yarmouth Roads, it was a great while before he had any
assurance that I was not drowned.
But my ill fate pushed me on with an obstinacy that nothing
could resist; and though I had several times loud calls from my
reason, and my more composed judgment, to go home, yet I had
no power to do it.—I know not what to call this, nor will I urge
that it is a secret, overruling decree, that hurries us on to be the
instruments of our own destruction, even though it be before us,
and that we rush upon it with our eyes open. Certainly, nothing
but some such decreed unavoidable misery attending, and which
it was impossible for me to escape, could have pushed me for-
ward against the calm reasonings and persuasions of my most
retired thoughts, and against two such visible instructions as

his tone was altered, and, looking very melancholy, and shaking
his head, he asked me how I did; telling his father who I was,
and how I had come this voyage only for a trial, in order to go
farther abroad. His father, turning to me, with a grave and
concerned tone, Young man, says he, you ought never to go to
sea any more; you ought to take this for a plain and visible
token, that you are not to be a seafaring mam—Why, sir? said
I; will you go to sea no more 'l—That is another case, said he;
it is my calling, and therefore my duty; but as you made this
voyage for a trial, you see what a taste Heaven has given you
of what you are to expect if you persist. Perhaps this has
all befallen us on your account, like Jonah in the ship of Tar-
shish.—Pray, continues he, what are you, and on what account
did you go to sea? Upon that I told him some of my story;
at the end of which he burst out with a strange kind of passion.
What had I done, said he, that such an unhappy wretch should
come into my ship? I would not set my foot in the same ship
with thee again for a thousand pounds. This indeed was, as 1
said, an excursion of his spirits, which were yet agitated by the
sense of his loss, and was farther than he could have authority
to go.—-However, he afterwards talked very gravely to me;
exhorted me to go back to my father, and not tempt Providence
to my ruin; told me, I might see a visible hand of Heaven
against me; and, young man, said he, depend upon it, if you do
not go back, wherever you go, you will meet with nothing but
disasters and disappointments, till your father’s words are ful-

We parted soon after, for I made him little answer, and I saw
him no more: which way he went, I know not: as for me,
having some mone; in my pocket, I travelled to London by
land; and the. e, as well as on the road, had many struggles with
myself what course of life I should take, and whether I should
go home or go to sea. As to going home, shame opposed the
best motions that offered to my thoughts; and it immediately
occurred to me how I should be laughed at among the neigh<
hours, and should be ashamed to see, not my father and mother
only, but even everybody else. From whence I have often since
observed, how incongruous and irrational the common temper
of mankind is, especially of youth, to that reason which ought
to guide them in such cases, viz. that they are not ashamed to
sin, and yet are ashamed to repent; not ashamed of the action,
for which they ought justly to be esteemed fools ; but are
ashamed of the returning, which only can make them be esteemed
wise men
In this state of life, however, I remained some time, uncertain
what measures to take, and what course of life to lead. An
irresistible reluctance continued to going home; and as I stayed
awhile, the remembrance of the distress I had been in were off;
and as that abated, the little motion I had in my desires to a
return wore off with it, till at last I quite laid aside the thoughts

IOBINBON'S CAPTIVITY AT SALLEE—ESCAPE WITH XURY—ARRIVAI-
AT THE BRAZIIS.
I WAS now set up for 8 Guinea trader ; and my friend, to my great) u n v' _
misfortune, dying soon after his arrival, I resolved to go the same
voyage again; and I embarked in the same vessel with one who
was his mate in the former voyage, and had now got the com-
mand of the ship. This was the unhappiest voyage that ever
man made; for though I did not carry quite a hundred pounds
of my new-gained wealth, so that I had two hundred pounds left,
and which I lodged with my friend's widow, who was very just
to me, yet I fell into terrible misfortunes in this voyage: and the
ROBINSON CRUSOE.

the hand of Heaven had overtaken me, and I was undone, with-
out redemption. But, alas! this was but a taste of the misery
I was to go through, as will appear in the se uel of this story.
As my new patron, or master, had taken me owe to his house,
so I was in hopes he would take me with him when he went to
sea again, believing that it would, some time or other, be his
fate to be taken by a Spanish or Portuguese man of war, and
that then I should be set at liberty. But this hope of mine was
soon taken away, for when he went to sea he left me on shore
to look after his little garden, and do the common drudgery of
slaves about his house; and when he came home again from his
cruise, he ordered me to lie in the cabin, to look after the ship.
Here I meditated nothing but my escape, and what method
I might take to effect it, but found no way that had the least
probability in it. Nothing presented to make the supposition
of it rational; forI had nobody to communicate it to that would
embark with me; no fellow'slave, no Englishman, Irishman, or
Scotchman there but myself; so that for two years, though I
often pleased myself with the imagination, yet I never had the
least encouraging prospect of putting it in practice.
After about two years, an odd circumstance presented itself,
which put the old thought of making some attempt for my liberty
again in my head. My patron lying at home longer than usual,

morning, a fog rose so thick, that though we were not half a
league from the shore, we lost sight of it; and rowing, we knew
not whither, or which way, we laboured all day, and all the
next night, and when the morning came, we found we had pulled
off to sea, instead of pulling in for the shore, and that we were
at least two leagues from the shore: however, we got well in
again, though with a great deal of labour, and some danger, for
the wind began to blow pretty fresh in the morning; but par-
ticularly we were all very hungry.
But our patron, warned by this disaster, resolved to take
more care of himself for the future; and having lying by him the
longboat of our English ship he had taken, he resolved he

English slave, to build a little state-room or cabin in the middle

it, to steer and haul home the main sheet, and room before for
a hand or two to stand and work the sails. She sailed with what

myself, not for a .shing business, int for a v0 age; though I

Moor, to get something for our subsistence on boar ; forI told
him we must not presume to eat of our patron’s bread: he said,
that was true; so he brought a large basket of rusk or biscuit,
of their kind, and three jars with fresh water, into the boat. I
knew where my patron's case of bottles stood, which it was
evident, by the make, were taken out of some English prize, and
l conveyed them into the boat while the Moor was on shore, as
if they had been there before for our master. I conveyed also
a great lump of bees-wax into the boat, which weighed above
half a hundred-weight, with a parcel of twine or thread, a
hatchet, a saw, and a hammer, all which were of great use to us
afterwards, especially the wax, to make candles. Another trick
I tried upon him, which he innocently came into also: his name
was Ismael, whom they call Muley, or Moley: so I called to
him; Moley, said I, our patron’s guns are on board the boat,

had it blown southerly, I had been sure to have made the coast

he might not see them, I said to the Moor, This will not do;

He, thinking no harm, agreed; and being at the head of the
boat, set the sails; and as I had the helm, I run the boat near
I 5 ADVENTURE OI
giving the boy the helm, I stepped forward to where the Moor
was, and I took him by surprise, with my arm under his waist,
and tossed him clear overboard into the sea. He rose imme-
diately, for he swam like a cork, and called to me, begged to be
taken in, and told me he would go all the world over with me.
He swam so strong after the boat, that he would have reached
me very quickly, there being but little wind; upon which I
stepped into the cabin, and fetching one of the fowling-pieces, I
resented it at him, and told him, I had done him no hurt, and
:f he would be quiet, I would do him none: But, said I, you swim
well enough to reach the shore, and the sea is calm ; make the
best of your way to shore, and I will do you no harm: but if you
come near the boat, I will shoot you through the head; forI am
resolved to have my liberty. So he turned himself about, and
swam for the shore ; and I make no doubt but he reached it with
ease, for he was an excellent swimmer.
I could have been content to have taken this Moor with me
and have drowned the boy, but there was no venturing to trust
him. When he was gone I turned to the boy, whom they called
Xury, and said to him, Xury, if you will be faithful to me I will
make you a great man; but if you will not stroke your face to
be true to me (that is, swear by Mahomet and his father’s heard),
I must throw you into the sea too. The boy smiled in my face,
and spoke so innocently, that I could not mistrust him; and
swore to be faithful to me, and go all over the world with me.
While I was in view of the Moor that was swimming, I stood
out directly to sea with the boat, rather stretching to windward,
that they might think me gone towards the Strait’s mouth (as
indeed any one that had been in their wits must have been sup-
posed to do) ; for who would have supposed we were sailing on
to the southward, to the truly Barbarian coast, where whole
nations of negroes were sure to surround us with their canoes,
and destroy us; where we could never once go on shore but we
should he devoured by savage beasts, or more merciless savages
of human kind?
But as soon as it grew dusk in the evening, I changed my
course, and steered directly south and by east, bending my course
a little towards the east, that I might keep in with the shore;
and having a fair fresh gale of wind, and a smooth quiet sea, I
made such sail, that I believe b the next day, at three o’clock
in the afternoon, when I made t e land, I could not be less than

Emperor of Morocco's dominions, or indeed of any other king

than the Wind shifting to the southward, I concluded also that if
[8 nnvsm'nars or
any of our vessels were in chase of me, they also would now
give over: so I ventured to make to the coast, and came to an
anchor in the mouth of a little river; I knew not what or where,
neither what latitude, what country, what nation, or whPt- river.
I neither saw, nor desired to see, any people ; the print-i; '. thing
I wanted was fresh water. We came into this creek in the
evening, resolving to swim on shore as soon as it was dark, and
discover the country : but as soon as it was quite dark, we heard
such dreadful noises of the barking, roaring, and howling of wild
creatures, of we knew not what kinds, that the poor boy was
ready to die with fear, and begged of me not to go on shore till
day. Well, Xury, said I, then I will not; but it may be, we may
- see men by day, who will be as bad to us as those lions Then
we may give them the shoot-gun, says Xury, laughing; make
them run away Such English Xury spoke by conversing among
us slaves. However, I was glad to see the boy so cheerful, and
I gave him a dram out of our patron's case of bottles to cheer
him up. After all, Xury's advice was good, and I took it. We
drop ed our little anchor, and lay still all night: I say still, for
we slept none; for in two or three hours we saw vast creatures
(we knew not what to call them), of many sorts, come down to
the sea-shore, and run into the water, wallowing and washing
themselves, for the pleasure of cooling themselves, and they
made such hideous _howlings and yellings, that I never indeed
heard the like.
Xury was dreadfully frightened, and indeed so was I too; but
we were both more frightened when we heard one of these mighty
creatures swimming towards our boat: we could not see him,
but we might hear him, by his blowing, to be a monstrous, huge
and furious beast. Xury said it was a lion, and it might be so,
for aught I know; but poor Xury cried to me to weigh the
anchor and row away. No, says I, Xury; we can slip our cable
with a buoy to it, and go off to sea: they cannot follow us far.
I had no sooner said so, but I perceived the creature (whatever
it was) within two oars' length, which something surprised me;
however, I immediately stepped to the cabin door, and taking up
[8 nnvsm'nars or
and swam to the shore again.
But it is impossible to describe the horrible noises, and hideous
cries and howlings that were raised, as well upon the edge of the
shore as higher within the country, upon the noise or report of
the gun; a thing, Ibelieve, those creatures had never heard
before. This convinced me there was no going on shore for us
in the night u on that coast: and how to venture on shore in the
day, was anot er question too; for to have fallen into the hands
of any of the savages, had been as bad as to have fallen into the
pews of lions and tigers; at least, we were equally apprehensive
of the danger of it.
Be that as it would, we were obliged to go on shore somewhere
or other for water, for we had not a pint left in the boat: when
and where to get it was the point. Xury said, if I would let him

water, and bring some to me. I asked him why he would go;
why I should not go, and he stay in the boat. The boy answered
aomnsos causoe. 19
Says he, If wild mans come, they eat me, you go away.—-Weil,
Xury, said I, we will both go; and if the wild mans come, we will
kill them; they shall eat neither of us. So I gave Xury a iece of
rusk bread to eat, and a dram out of our patron's case of ottles,
which I mentioned before; and we hauled in the boat as near the
shore as we thought was proper, and so waded to shore, carrying
nothing but our arms, and two 'ars for water.
I did not care to go out of s'rg t of the boat, fearing the coming
of canoes with savages down the river ; but the boy, seeing a low
place about a mile up the country, rambled to it; and, by and by,
I saw him come running towards me. I thought he was ursued
by some savage, or frightened by some wild beast, and I t erefore
ran forwards to help him; but when I came nearer to him, I saw
something hanging over his shoulders, which was a creature that
he had shot, like a hare, but different in colour, and longer legs:
however, we were very glad of it, and it was very good meat:
but the great joy that poor Xury came with, was to tell me he
had found good water, and seen no wild mans.
But we found afterwards that we need not take such pains for
water; for a little higher up the creek where we were, we found
aomnsos causoe. 19
aomnsos causoe. 19
here we had killed; and prepared to go on our way, having seen
no footsteps of any human creature in that art of the country.
As I had been one voyage to this coast efore, I knew very
well that the islands of the Canaries, and the Cape de Verd
Islands also, lay not far from the coast. But as I had no instru-
aomnsos causoe. 19
and did not exactly know, or at least remember, what latitude
they were in, I knew not where to look for them, or when to
stand off to sea towards them, otherwise I might now have easily
found some of these islands. But my hope was, that if I stood
along this coast till I came to the part where the English traded,
aomnsos causoe. 19
trade, that would relieve and take us in.
By the best of my calculation, the place where I now was, must
be that country which, lying between the Emperor of Morocco's
dominions and the Negroes, lies waste, and uninhabited, except
by wild beasts ; the Negroes having abandoned it, and gone
farther south, for fear of the Moors, and the Moors not thinking
It worth inhabiting, by reason of its barrenness; and, indeed
both forsaking it because of the prodigious numbers of tigers,
lions, leopards, and other furious creatures which harbour there.
so that the Moors use it for their hunting only, where they go
like an army, two or three thousand men at a time: and, indeed,
for near a hundred miles together upon this coast, we saw nothing
but a waste, uninhabited country by day, and heard nothing but
howlings and roaring of wild beasts by night.
Once or twice, in the day-time, I thought I saw the Pico of

thither; but having tried twice, I was forced in again by con-
trary winds ; the sea also going too high for my little vessel; so

Several times I was obliged to land for fresh water, after we
had left this place; and once, in particular, being early in the
morning, we came to an anchor under a little point of land which

go farther in. Xury, whose eyes were more about him than, it
seems, mine were, calls softly to me, and tells me, that we had
best go farther off the shore; for, says he, Look, yonder lies a
dreadful monster on the side of that hillock, fast asleep. I looked
where he pointed, and sawa dreadful monster indeed, for it was a
terrible great lion, that lay on the side of the shore, under the
shade of a piece of the hill, that hung, as it were, over him.
Xury, says I, cyou shall go on shore and kill him. Xury looked
frightened, an said, Me kill! he eat me at one month: one
mouthful he meant. However, I said no more to the boy but
bade him be still; and I took our biggest gun, which was almost
musket bore, and loaded it with a good charge of powder, and
with two slugs, and laid it down; then I loaded another gun
with two bullets : and a third, for we had three pieces, I loaded

was a little surprised that I had not hit him on the head; how-
ever, I took up the second piece immediately, and though he

the pleasure to see him drop, and make but little noise, but lie
struggling for life. Then Xury took heart, and would have me
let him go on shore. Well, go, said I; so the boy jumped into
the water, and taking a little gun in one hand, swam to shore
with the other hand, and coming close to the creature, put the
muzzle of the piece to his ear, and shot him in the head again,
which despatched him quite. '
This was game. indeed, to us, but it was no fcod; and I wal
very sorry to lose three charges of powder and shot upon a
creature that was good for nothing to us. However, Xury said
he would have some of him; so he comes on board, and asked
me to give him the hatchet: For what, Xury? said I. Me cut
nonmson causes. 21
head; but he cut off a foot, and brought it with him, and it was
a monstrous great one. I bethought myself, however, that per-
haps the skin of him might, one way or other, be of some value
to us; and I resolved to take off his skin, if I could. So Xury
and I went to work with him: but Xury was much the better
workman at it, for I knew ve ill how to do it. Indeed, it took
us both up the whole day; ut at last we got off the hide of
him. and spreading it on the top of our cabin, the sun effectually
dried it in two days' time, and it afterwards served me to lie
upon.
After this sto we made on to the southward continually, for
ten or twelve ays, living very sparingly on our provisions,
which began to abate very much, and going no oltener into the
shore than we were obliged to for fresh water. My design in
this, was to make the river Gambia, or Senegal: that is to say,
anywhere about the Cape de Verd, where I was in hopes to
meet with some European ship; and if I did not, I knew not
what course I had to take, but to seek for the islands or perish
among the Negroes. I knew that all the ships from Europe,
which sailed either to the coast of Guinea, or to Brazil, or to
the East Indies, made this Cape, or those islands: and in a
word I put the whole of my fortune upon this single point, either
that I must meet with some ship, or must perish.
When I had pursued this resolution about ten days longer, as
l have said, I began to see that the land was inhabited; and in
two or three places, as we sailed by, we saw people stand upon
the shore to look at us: we could also perceive they were quite
black and stark naked. I was once inclined to have gone on
shore to them; but Xury was my better counsellor, and said to
me, No go, no go. However, I hauled in nearer the shore, that
I might talk to them; and I found they ran along the shore by
me a good wa . I observed they had no wea ons in their hands,
except one, who had a long slender stick, w ich Xury said was
a lance, and that they would throw them a great way with good
aim; so Ikept at a distance, but talked to them by signs. as
well as I could, and particularly made signs for something to
eat. They beckoned to me to stop my boat, and they would
fetch me some meat: upon this I owered the top of my sail,
and lay by, and two of them ran up into the country; and in
less than half an hour came back, and brought with them two
nonmson causes. 21
country; but we neither knew what the one or the other was;
however, We were willing to accept it. But how to come at it
was our next dispute, for I was not for venturing on shore to
them, and they were as much afraid of us: but they took a safe
wag for us all, for they brought it to the shore, and laid it down,
an went and stood a great way off till we fetched it on board,
and then came close to us again.
We made signs of thanks to them, for we had nothing to
make them amends; but an opportunity offered that very instant
to oblige them wonderfully; for while we were 1 'ng by the
shore, came two mighty creatures, one pursuing e other (as
22 mvan'runm or

they were in sport or in rage, we could not tell, any more than
we could tell whether it was usual or strange; but I believe it

we found the people terribly frightened, especially the women.

the rest did; however, as the two creatures ran directly into
the water, they did not seem to offer to fall upon any of the
Negroes, but plunged themselves into the sea, and swam about,
as if they had come for their diversion; at last, one of them

lay ready for him, for I had loaded my gun with all possible
expedition, and bade Xury load both the others. As soon as

but between the wound which was his mortal hurt, and the
strangling of the water, he died just before he reached the shore.
It is impossible to express the astonishment of these poor

even ready to die for fear, and fell down as dead with the very
terror; but when they saw the creature dead, and sunk in the
water, and that I made signs to them to come to the shore, they
took heart and came to the shore, and began to search for the
creature. I found him by his blood staining the water; and by
the help of a rope, which I slung round him, and gave the
Negroes to haul, they dragged him on shore, and found that it

mountains from whence they came; nor could I, at that distance,
know what it was. I found quickly the Negroes were for eating

as a favour from me; which. when I made signs to them that
thoy might take him, they were very thankful for. Immediately
they fell to work with him; and though they had no knife, yet
with a sharpened piece of wood, they took off his skin as
readily, and much more readily, than we could have done with

making as if I would give it them, but made signs for the skin,
which they gave me very freely, and brought me a great deal
more of their provisons, which, though I did not understand,
et I accepted. I then made signs to them for some water, and
held out one of my jars to them, turning it bottom upwards, to
aosnvsoN causos. 23
They called immediately to some of their friends, and there came
two women, and brought a great vessel made of earth, and
burnt, as I suppose, in the sun; this they set down to me, as

all three. The women were as stark naked as the men.
I was now furnished with roots and corn, such as it was, and
water; and leaving my friendly Negroes, I made forward for
about eleven days more, without offering to go near the shore,
till I saw the land run out a great length into the sea, at about
aosnvsoN causos. 23
aosnvsoN causos. 23
doubling the point, at about two leagues from the land, I saw
plainly land on the other side, to seaward: then I concluded, as
it was most certain indeed, that this was the Cape de Verd, and
those the islands, called, from thence, Cape de Verd Islands.
However, they were at a great distance, and I could not well
tell what I had best to do; for if I should be taken with a gale
of wind, I might neither reach one nor the other.
In this dilemma, as I was very pensive, I stepped into the
cabin, and sat me down, Xury having the helm; when, on a
sudden, the boy cried out, Master, master, a ship with a sail!
and the foolish boy was frightened out of his wits, thinking it
must needs be some of his master's ships sent to pursue us,
when I knew we were gotten far enough out of their reach. I
jumped out of the cabin, and immediately saw, not only the
ship, but what she was, viz. that it was a Portuguese ship, and,
as I thought, was bound to the Coast of Guinea, for Negroes.
But, when I observed the course she steered, I was soon con-
vinced they were bound some other We , and did not design to
come any nearer to the shore; upon which, I stretched out to
sea as much as I could, resolving to speak with them, if possible.
With all the sail I could make, I found I should not be able
to come in their way, but that they would be one by before 1
could make any signal to them; but after I h crowded to the
utmost, and began to despair, the , it seems, saw me, by the
help of their perspective glasses, an that it was some European

couraged with this, and as I had my patron’s ensign on board,

gun, both which they saw; for they told me they saw the smoke,
though they did not hear the gun. Upon these signals, they
very kindly brought to, and lay by for me; and in about three
hours' time I came up with them.
They asked me what I was, in Portuguese, and in Spanish,
and in French, but I understood none of them ; but, at last, a
Scotch sailor who was on board, called to me, and I answered
him, and told him I was an Englishman, that I had made my
escape out of slavery from the Mom-s, at Sallee: they then
bade me come on board, and very kindly took me in, and all my
oods.
g It was an inexpressible joy to me, which any one will believe,
that I was thus delivered, as I esteemed it, from such a miserable,
and almost hopeless, condition as I was in; and I immediately

it may, one time or other, be my lot to be taken up in the same

what you have, you will be starved there, and then I only take
away that life I had given. N o, no, Senhor Ingles (Mr. English-~

As he was charitable in this proposal, so he was just in the
performance, to a tittle: for he ordered the seamen, that none
should offer to touch anything I had: then he took everything
into his own possession, and gave me back an exact inventory
of them, that I might have them, even so much as my three
earthen jars.
As to my boat, it was a very good one; and that he saw, and
told me he would buy it of me for the ship’s use; and asked me
what I would have for it? I told him, he had been so generous
to me in everything, that I could not offer to make any price 01
the boat, but left it entirely to him: upon which, he told me he
would give me a note of hand to pay me eighty pieces of eight
for it at Brazil; and when it came there, if any one offered to

of eight more for my boy Xury, which I was loath to take; not
that I was not willing to let the captain have him, but I was
ver loath to sell the poor boy's liberty, who had assisted me
so aithfully in procuring my own. However, when I let him
know my reason, he owned it to be just, and offered me this
medium, that he would give the boy an obligation to set him
free in ten years, if he turned Christian; upon this, and Xury
saying he was willing to go to him, I let the captain have him.
We had a very good voyage to the Brazils, and arrived in the
Bay de Todos los Santos, or All Saints’ Bay, in about twenty-
two days after. And now I was once more delivered from the
most miserable of all conditions of life; and what to do next
with myself, I was now to consider.
The generous treatment the captain gave me, I can never
20 mvsxruaas or
enough remember: he would take nothing of me for my pass
gave me twenty ducats for the leopard‘s skin, and forty for t e
lion's skin, which I had in my boat, and caused everything I had
in the ship to be punctually delivered to me; and what I was
willing to sell, he bought of me; such as the case of bottles, two
of my guns, and a piece of the lump of bees-wax,—for I had
made candles of the rest: in a word, I made about two hundred
and twenty pieces of eight of all my cargo; and with this stock,
(I went on shore in the Brazils.
I had not been long here, before I was recommended to the
house of a good honest man, like himself, who had an ingenio
as they call it (that is, a plantation and a sugar-house). I lived
with him some time, and acquainted myself, by that means, with
the manner of planting and of making sugar; and seeing how
well the planters lived, and how they got rich suddenly, I re-
solved, if I could get a license to settle there, I would turn
20 mvsxruaas or
out some way to get my money, which I had left in London,
remitted to me. To this purpose, getting a kind of letter of
naturalization, I urchased as much land that was uncured as
my money woul reach, and formed a plan for my plantation
and settlement; such a one as might be suitable to the stock
which I proposed to myself to receive from England.
I had a neighbour, a Portuguese of Lisbon, but born 01
English parents, whose name was Wells, and in much such
circumstances as I was. I call him my neighbour, because his
plantation lay next to mine, and we went on very sociably
together. My stock was but low, as well as his; and we rather
planted for food than anything else, for about two years. How-
ever, we began to increase, and our land began to come into
order; so that the third year we planted some tobacco, and made
each of us a large piece of ground ready for planting canes in the
year to come; but we both wanted help; and now I found more
r than before, I had done wrong in parting with my boy Xury.
"' But, alas! for me to do wrong, that never did right, was no
" great wonder. I had no remedy, but to go on: I had got into
an employment uite remote to my genius, and directly contrary
to the life I de ighted in, and for which I forsook my father’s
house, and broke through all his good advice: nay, I was com-
ing into the very middle station, or upper degree of low life,
which my father advised me to before; and which, if I resolved
to go on with, I might as well have staid at home, and never
have fatigued myself in the world, as I had done: and I used
often to say to in self, I could have done this as well in England,
20 mvsxruaas or
among strangers and savages, in a wilderness, and at such a
distance as never to hear from any part of the world that had
the least knowledge of ms
In this manner, I used to look upon my condition with the
utmost regret. I had nobody to converse with, but now and.
then this neighbour; no wcrk to be done, but by the labour of
my hands: and I used to say, I lived just like a man cast away
upon some desolate island, that had nobody there but himself.

worse, Heaven may oblige them to make the exchange, and be
convinced of their former felicity by their experience: I say,

in an island of mere desolation, should be my lot, who had so
often unjustly compared it with.the life which I then led, in
which, had I continued, Ihad, in all probability, been exceeding
prosperous and rich!
I was, in some degree, settled in my measures for carrying on
the plantation, before my kind friend, the captain of the ship
that took me up at sea, went back; for the ship remained there,
in providing his lading, and preparing for his voyage, near three
months; when telling him what little stock I had left behind
me in London, he gave me this friendly and sincere advice:
Senhor Inglez, says he (for so he always called me), if you will
give me letters, and a procuration here in form to me, with
orders to the person who has your money in London, to send
aosmsos causos. 21
such goods as are proper for this country, I will bring you the
produce of them, God willing, at my return: but since human
affairs are all subject to changes and disasters, I would have
you give orders for but one hundred pounds sterling, which, you
say, is half your stock, and let the hazard be run for the first, so
that if it come safe, you may order the rest the same way; and,
if it miscarry, you may have the other half to have recourse to
for your supply. This was so wholesome advice, and looked so
friendly, that I could not but be convinced it was the best course
I could take; so I accordingly prepared letters to the gentle-
wuman with whom I left my money, and a procuration to the
Portuguese captain, as he desired me.

Portuguese captain at sea, the humanity of his behaviour, and
What condition I was now in, with all other necessary directions
for my supply; and when this honest captain came to Lisbon,
he found means, by some of the English merchants there, to
send over, not the order only, but a full account of my story to
a. merchant at London, who represented it effectually to her:
whereupon she not only delivered the money, but, out of her
own pocket, sent the Portuguese captain a very handsome
present for his humanity and charity to me.
The merchant in London, vesting this hundred pounds 'II

(English goods, such as the captain had wrote for, sent them
, ,, , 5 directly to him at Lisbon, and he brought them all safe to me at
t '{3 the Brazils: among which, without my direction (for I was too
* “ " young in my business to think of them), he had taken care to
ave all sorts of tools, iron work, and utensils, necessary for
my plantation, and which were of great use to me. When this
cargo arrived, I thought my fortune made, for I was surprised
with the joy of it; and my good steward, the captain, had laid
28 anvanrunrs or
for himself“, to purchase and bring me over a servant, under
bond for six years' service, and would not accept of any con-
sideration, except a little tobacco, which I would have him
accept, being of my own produce. Neither was this all: but
my goods being all English manufactures, such as cloths, stuffs,
baize, and things particularly valuable and desirable in the
country, I found means to sell them to a very great advantage;
so that I might say, I had more than four times the value of
28 anvanrunrs or
28 anvanrunrs or
thing I did, I bought me a. Negro slave, and a European servant
also; I mean another besides that which the captain brought
me from Lisbon.
But as abused prosperity is oftentimes made the very means
of our adversity, so was it with me. I went on the next year

28 anvanrunrs or
increasing in business and in wealth, my head began to be full
of projects and undertakings beyond my reach; such as are,
indeed, often the ruin of the best heads in business. Had I
continued in the station I was now in, Ihad room for all the
happy things to have (yet befallen me, for which my father so
earnestly recommends a quiet, retired life, and which he had
so sensibly described the middle station of life to be full of: but
other things attended me, and I was still to be the wilful agent
of all my own miseries ; and, particularly, to increase my fault,
28 anvanrunrs or
sorrows I should have leisure to make, all these miscarriages
were procured by my apparent obstinate adhering to my foolish
inclination, of wandering about, and pursuing that inclination,
in contradiction to the clearest views of doing myself good in a
fair and plain pursuit of those prospects, and those measures of
life, which nature and Providence concurred to present me with,
and to make my duty.
As I had once done thus in breaking away from my parents,
so I could not be content now, but I must go and leave the
happy view I had of being a rich and thriving man in my new
plantation, only to pursue a rash and immoderate desire of rising
faster than the nature of the thing admitted; and thus I cast
myself down again into the deepest gulf of human misery that
ever man fell into, or perhaps could be consistent with life, and
a state of health in the world.
To come then, by just degrees, to the particulars of this part
of my story.—You may suppose, that having now lived almost
four years in the Brazils, and beginning to thrive and prosper
very well upon my plantation, I had not only learned the lan-
guage, but had contracted an acquaintance and friendship among
my fellow-planters, as well as among the merchants at St. Salva-
dor, which was our port: and that, in my discourses among them,
I had frequently given them an account of my two voyages to the
coast of Guinea, the manner of trading with the Negroes there,
aosnvson causos. 29
beads, toys, knives, scissars, hatchets, bits of glass, and the like
-—not only gold dust, Guinea grains, elephants’ teeth, 810., but
Negroes, for the service of the Brazils, in great numbers.
They listened always very attentively to my discourses on
these heads, but especially to that part which related to the
buying Negroes; which was a trade, at that time, not only not
far entered into, but, as far as it was, had been carried on by the
assientos, or permission of the kings of Spain and Portugal, and
engrossed from the public; so that few Negroes Were bought,
and those excessively dear. ,/
It happened, being in company with some merchants and
planters of my acquaintance, and talking of those things very
earnestly, three of them came to me the next morning, and told
me they had been musing very much upon what I had discoursed
with them of the last night, and they came to make a secret pro-

had all plantations as well as I, and were straitened for nothing
so much as servants; that as it was a trade that could not be
carried on, because they could not publicly sell the Negroes when
they came home, so they desired to make but one voyage, to
bring the Negroes on shore privately, and divide them among
their own plantations; and, in a word, the question was, whether
I would go their supercargo in the ship, to manage the trading
part upon the coast of Guinea; and they offered me that I should
ave an equal share of the Negroes, without providing any part
of the stock.
This was a fair proposal, it must be confessed, had it been made
to any one that had not a settlement and plantation of his own
to look after, which was in a fair way of coming to be very con-
siderable, and with a good stock upon it. But for me, that was
thus entered and established, and had nothing to do but go on as
D 3
I had begun, for three or four years more, and to have sent for
the other hundred pounds from England; and who, in that time
and with that little addition, could scarce have failed of being
worth three or four thousand pounds sterling, and that in-
creasing too; for me to think of such a voyage, was the most
preposterous thing that ever man, in such circumstances, could
e guilty of.
But I, that was born to be my own destroyer, could no more

when my father’s good counsel was lost upon me. In a word, I
told them I would go with all my heart, if they would undertake
to look after my plantation in my absence, and would dispose of
it to such as I should direct, if I miscarried. This they all
engaged to do, and entered into writings or covenants to do so:
and I made a formal will, disposing of my plantation and effects,
in case of my death; making the captain of the ship that had
saved my life, as before, my universal heir; but obliging him to
dispose of my effects as I had directed in my will; one-half of the
produce being to himself, and the other to be shipped to England.
In short, I took all possible caution to preserve my effects, and
to keep up my plantation : had I used half as much prudence to
have looked into my own interest, and have made a judgment of
what I ought to have done and not to have done, I had certainly
never gone away from so prosperous an undertaking, leaving all
the probable views of a thriving circumstance, and gone a voyage
to sea, attended with all its common hazards, to say nothing of
the reasons I had to expect particular misfortunes to myself.
But I was hurried on, and obeyed blindly the dictates of my
fancy, rather than my reason: and accordingly, the ship, being

The very same day I went on board we set sail, standing away
to the northward upon our own coast, with design to stretc

degrees of northern latitude, which, it seems, was the manner of
their course in those days, we had very good weather, only
excessively hot all the way upon our own coast, till we came to

observation, in seven degrees twenty-two minutes northern lati-
tude, when a violent tornado, or hurricane, took us quite out of
our knowledge: it began from the south-east, came about to the
north-west, and then settled in the north-east; from whence it
blew in such a terrible manner, that for twelve days together we
could do nothing but drive, and, scudding away before it, let it
carry us whithersoever fate and the fury of the winds directed;
and, during these twelve days, I need not say that I expected
every day to be swallowed up ; nor, indeed, did any in the ship
expect to save their lives,
In this distress, we had, besides the terror of the storm, one of
our men died of the calenture, and one man and a boy washed
overboard. About the twelfth day, the weather abating a little,
the master made an observation as well as he could, and found
that he was in about eleven degrees north latitude, but that he
was twenty-two degrees of longitude difference, west from Cape
St. Augustino; so that he found he was got upon the coast of
Guiana, or the north part of Brazil, beyond the river Amazons,
toward that of the river Oronoco, commonly called the Great
River; and began to consult with me what course he should
take, for the ship was leaky and very much disabled, and he was
for going directly back to the coast of Brazil.
I was positively against that; and looking over the charts of
the sea-coast of America with him, we concluded there was no
inhabited country for us to have recourse to, till we came within
the circle of the Carribee islands, and therefore resolved to stand
ROBINSON causos.‘ 31
indraft of the bay or gulf of Mexico, we might easily perform, as
ROBINSON causos.‘ 31
possibly make our voyage to the coast of Africa without some
assistance, both to our ship and ourselves.
With this design, we changed our course, and steered away
N.W. b W. in order to reach some of our English islands, where
I'hope for relief: but our voyage was otherwise determined;
for being in the latitude of twelve degrees eighteen minutes a
second storm came upon us, which carried us away with the
same impetuosity westward, and drove us so out of the very way
of all human commerce, that had all our lives been saved, as to
the sea, we were rather in danger of being devoured by savages
than ever returning to our own country.
In this distress, the wind still blowing very hard, one of our
men early in the morning, cried out, Land! and we had no
sooner run out of the cabin to look out, in hopes of seeing
whereabouts in the world we were, than the ship struck upon
a sand, andin a moment, her motion being so stopped, the sea
_~-‘1\
broke over her in such a manner, that we expected we should all
have perished immediately; and we were immediately driven
into our close quarters, to shelter us from the very foam and
spray of the sea.
'It is not easy for any one who has not been in the like con-
dition to describe or conceive the consternation of men in such
circumstances: we knew nothing where we were, or upon what
-land it was we were driven, whether an island or the main,
whether inhabited or not inhabited; and as the rage of the wind

much as hope to have the ship hold many minutes without
breaking in pieces, unless the wind, by a kind of miracle, should
immediately turn about. In a word we sat looking upon one
another, and expecting death every moment, and every man
acting accordingly, as preparing for another world; for there
was little or nothing more for us to do in this : that which was
our present comfort, and all the comfort we had, was, that, con
trary to our expectation, the ship did not break yet, and that
the master said the wind began to abate.
Now, though we thought that the wind did a little abate, 'et
the ship having thus struck upon the sand, and sticking too ast
for us to expect her getting off, we were in a dreadful condition
indeed, and had nothing to do, but to think of saving our lives
as well as we could. We had a boat at our stern just before the

had another boat on board, but how to get her off into the sea
was a doubtful thing; however, there was no room to debate,
for we fancied the ship would break in pieces every minute, and
some told us she was actually broken already.
In this distress, the mate of our vessel laid hold of the boat,
32 ADVENTURES OF
the ship’s side; and getting all into her, we let her go, an com-
mitted ourselves, being eleven in number, to God's mercy, and
the wild sea: for though the storm was abated considerably, yet
the sea went dreadfully high upon the shore, and might be
well called den wild zee, as the Dutch call the sea in a storm.
And now our-case was very dismal indeed; for we all saw
plainly, that the sea went so high, that the boat could not live,
and that we should be inevitably drowned. As to making sail,
we had none; nor, if we had, could we have done anything with
it; so we worked at the oar towards the land, though with heavy
hearts, like men going to execution; for we all knew that when
the boat came nearer to the shore, she would be dashed in a
thousand pieces by the breach of the sea. However, we com-
mitted our souls to God in the most earnest manner, and the
wind driving us towards the shore, we hastened our destruo-
{iota with our own hands, pulling as well as we could towards
an .
What the shore was—whether rock or sand, whether-steep or
shoal—we knew not; the only hope that could rationally give
us the least shadow of expectation, was, if we might happen
into some bay or gulf, or the mouth of some river, where by
great chance we might have run our boat in, or got under the
lee of the land, and perhaps made smooth water. But nothing
of this appeared; and as we made nearer and nearer the shore,
the land looked more frightful than the sea.
After we had rowed, or rather driven, about a league and a
half, as we reckoned it, a raging wave, mountain-like, came rolling
astern of us, and plainly bade us expect the coup de grace. In
a word, it took us with such fury, that it overset the boat at
once; and separating us, as well from the boat as from one
another, gave us not time hardly to say, “ O God ! ” for we were
all swallowed up in a moment.
Nothing can describe the confusion of thought which I felt,
when I sunk into the water; for though I swam very well, yet
[could not deliver myself from the waves so as to draw my
breath, till that wave having driven me, or rather carried me, a
vast way on towards the shore, and having spent itself, went
back, and left me upon the land almost dry, but half dead with
the water I took in. I had so much presence of mind, as well as
breath left, that seeing myself nearer the main land than I ex-
pected, I got upon my feet, and endeavoured to make on towards
the land as fast as I could, before another wave should return
and take me up again; butI soon found it was impossible to
avoid it; for I saw the sea come after me as high as a great hill,
and as furious as an enemy which I had no means or strength to
contend with: my business was to hold my breath, and raise
myself upon the water, if I could; and so, by swimming, to pre-
serve my breathing, and pilot myself towards the shore, ifpos-
sible ; my greatest concern now being, that the wave, as it would
carry me a great way towards the shore when it came on, might
not carry me back again with it when it gaveback towards the sea.
The wave that came upon me again buried me at once twenty
or thirty feet deep in its own body ; and I could feel myself car-
ried with a mighty force and swiftness towards the shore, a very
great way; but I held my breath, and assisted myself to swim
still forward with all my might. I was ready to burst with
holding my breath, when, as I felt myself rising up, so, to my
immediate relief, I found my head and hands shoot out above
the surface of the water; and though it was not two seconds of
time that I could keep myself so, yet it relieved me greatly, gave
me breath and new courage. I was covered again with water a

water had spent itself, an began to return, I struck forward
against the return of the waves, and felt ground again with my
feet. I stood still a few moments, to recover breath, and till the
water went from me, and then took to my heels, and ran with what
strength I had farther towards the shore. But neither would this
deliver me from the fury of the sea, which came pouring in after
me again; and twice more I was lifted up by the waves and
34 ADVENTURES or
The last time of these two had well nigh been fatal to me; for
the sea, having hurried me along, as before, landed me, or rather
dashed me, against a piece of a rock, and that with such force, that
it left me senseless, and indeed helpless, as to my own deliverance;
for the blow, taking my side and breast, beat the breath, as it
were, quite out of my body; and had it returned again imme-
diately, I must have been strangledin the water: but I recovered
a little before the return of the waves, and, seeing I should again
be covered with the water, I resolved to hold fast by a piece of
the rock, and so to hold my breath, if possible, till the wave
34 ADVENTURES or
being nearer land, I held my hold till the wave abated, and then
fetched another run, which brought me so near the shore, that
the next wave, though it went over me, yet did not so swallow
me up as to carry me away; and the next run I took, I got to
the main land; where, to my great comfort, I clambered up the
cliffs of the shore, and sat me down upon the grass, free from
danger, and quite out of the reach of the water.
I was now landed, and safe on shore; and began to look up
and thank God that my life was saved, in a case wherein there
were, some minutes before, scarcely any room to hope. I be-
lieve it is impossible to express, to the life, what the ecstasies
and transports of the soul are, when it is so saved, as I may say,
out of the grave: and I did not wonder now at the custom, viz,
that when a malefactor, who has the halter about his neck, is
tied up, and just going to be turned off, and has a reprieve
brought to him ; I say, I do not wonder that they bring a surgeon
with it, to let him blood that very moment they tell him of it,
that the surprise ma not drive the animal spirits from the

condition. I began to look around me, to see what kind of a place
I was in, and what was next to be done; and I soon found my
comforts abate, and that, in a word, I had a dreadful deliverance:
for I was wet, had no clothes to shift me, nor anything either to
eat or drink, to comfort me; neither did I see any prospect be-

was, that I had no weapon either to hunt and kill any creature
for my sustenance, or to defend myself against any other crea-

nothing about me but a knife, a tobacco-pipe, and a little tobacco
in a box. This was all my provision; and this threw me into
such terrible agonies of mind, that, for a while, I ran about like
a madman. Night coming upon me, I began, with a heavy heart,
to consider what would be my lot if there were any ravenous
beasts in that country, seeing at night they always come abroad
for their prey.

WHEN I waked it was broad day, the weather clear, and the
storm abated, so that the sea. did not rage and swell as before;
but that which surprised me most was, that the ship was lifted
off in the night from the sand where she lay, by the swelling of
the tide, and was driven up almost as far as the rock which I at
36 ADVENTURES or
me against it. This being within about a mile from the shore
where I was, and the ship seeming to stand upright still, I
wished myself on board, that at least I might save some neces-
sary things for my use. '
When I came down from my apartment in the tree, I louked

lay, as the wind and the sea had tossed her up, upon the land,
about two miles on my right hand. I walked as far as I could
upon the shore to have got to her; but found a neck, or inlet,
of water, between me and the boat, which was about half a mile
broad; so I came back for the present, being more intent upon
36 ADVENTURES or
present subsistence.
A little after noon, I found the sea very calm, and the tide
ebbed so far out, that I could come within a quarter of a mile of
the ship: and here I found a fresh renewing of my grief; for I
saw evidently, that if we had kept on board, we had been all safe;
that is to say, we had all got safe on shore, and I had not been
so miserable as to be left entirely destitute of all comfort and
company, as I now was. This forced tears from my eyes again;
but as their was little relief in that, I resolved, if possible, to get

to extremity, and took the water: but when I came to the ship,

as she lay aground, and high out of the water, there was nothing
within my reach to lay hold of. I swam round her twice, and
the second time I spied a small piece of rope, which I wondered

that with great diti‘iculty I got hold of it, and by the help of that
rope got into the forecastle of the ship. Here I found that the
ship was bulged, and had a great deal of water in her hold; but
that she lay so on the side of a bank of hard sand, or rather
earth, that her stern lay lifted up upon the bank, and her head
low, almost to the water. By this means all her quarter was
free, and all that was in that part was dry; for you may be sure

no time to lose. I also found some rum in the great cabin, of
which I took a large dram, and which I had indeed need enough
of, to spirit me for what was before me. Now I wanted nothing
but a boat, to furnish myself with many things which I foresaw
would be very necessary to me.
It was in vain to Sit still and wish for what was not to be had,
and this extremity roused my application: we had several spare
yards, and two or three large spars of wood, and a spare top-
mast or two in the ship ; I resolved to fall to work with these,
nonmson causes. 37
tying every one with a rope, that they might not drive away.
When this was done, I went down the ship's side, and pulling
them to me, I tied four of them fast together at both ends, as
well as I could, in the form of a raft, and laying two or three
short pieces of plank upon them, crossways, I found I could
walk upon it very well, but that it was not able to bear any '
great weight, the pieces being too light: so I went to work, and
with the carpenter's saw I cut a, spare topmast into three
lengths, and added them to my raft, with a eat deal of labour
and pains. But the hope of furnishing myse with necessaries,
encouraged me to go eyond what I should have been able to
have done upon another occasion.
My raft was now strong enough to bear any reasonable
weight. _My next care was what to load it with, and how to
preserve what I laid upon it from the surf of the sea; but I was
nonmson causes. 37
upon it that I could get, and having considered well what 1 most
wanted, I got three of the seamen’s chests, which I had broken
open and emptied, and lowered them down upon my raft; these

which were only linen, and open-kneed, I swam on board in

I wanted for present use, for I had other things which my eye

which was indeed a very useful prize to me, and much more
valuable than a ship-lading of gold would have been at that time.
I got it down to my raft, even whole as it was, without losing
time to look into it, for I knew in general what it contained.
My next care was for some ammunition and arms. There
were two very good fowling-pieces in the great cabin, and two

three barrels of powder in the ship, but knew not where our
gunner had stowed them; but with much search I found them,
two of them dry and good, the third had taken water. Those
two I got to my raft, with the arms. And now I thought my—
self pretty well freighted, and began to think how I should get
_ to shore with them, having neither sail, oar, nor rudder; and
the least capful of wind would have overset all my navigation.

having found two or three broken oars belonging to the boat,

it drive a little distant from the place where I had landed before;
by which I perceived that there was some indraft of the water,

I might make use of as a port to get to land with my cargo.
As I imagined, so it was: there appeared before me a little
opening of the land, and I found a strong current of the tide set
hito it; so I guided my raft, as well as I could, to get into the
middle of the stream. , But here I had like to have suffered a

water brought me a little more upon a level; and a little after,

with the oar I had into the channel, and then driving up higher,
I at length found myself in the mouth of a little river, with land
on both sides, and a strong current or tide running up. I looked
on both sides for a proper place to get to shore, for I was not
willing to be driven too high up the river; hoping, in time, to
see some ship at sea, and therefore resolved to place myself as
near the coast as I could.
At length I spied a little cove on the right shore of the creek,

at last got so near, as that, reaching ound with my oar, I could

one on one side, near one end, and one on the other side, near
the other end: and thus I lay till the water ebbed away, and left
my raft and all my cargo safe on shore.
My next work was to view the country, and seek a proper
place for my habitation, and where to stow my goods, to secure
them from whatever might happen. Where I was 1 yet knew
not; whether on the continent, or on an island; whether inha-
bited, or not inhabited; whether in danger of wild beasts, or not.
There was a hill, not above a mile from me, which rose up very
steep and high, and which seemed to overtop some other hills,
which lay as in a ridge from it, northward. l took out one of
the fowling—pieces, and one of the pistols, and a horn of powder;

ADVENTURES OF
and thus armed, I travelled for discovery up to the top of that
40
40
in an island, environed every way with the sea, no land to be
seen, except some rocks, which lay a great way off, and two small
islands, less than this, which lay about three leagues to the west.
I found also that the island I was in was barren, and, as I
saw good reason to believe, uninhabited, except by wild beasts,
of whom, however, I saw none; yet I saw abundance of fowls,
but knew not their kinds; neither, when Ikilled them, could
40
I shot at a great bird, which I saw sitting upon a tree, on the
40
40
40
merable number of fowls, of many sorts, making a confused
screaming, and crying, every one according to his usual note;
but not one of them of any kind that I knew. As for the crea-v
ture I killed, I took it to be a kind of a hawk, its colour and beak
resembling it, but it had no talons or claws more than common.
40
Contented with this discovery, I came back to my raft, and
fell to work to bring my cargo on shore, which took me up the
rest of that day : what to do with myself at night I knew not,
nor indeed where to rest: for I was afraid to lie down on the
ground, not knowing but some wild beast might devour me;
though, as I afterwards found, there was really no need for those
fears. However, as well as I could, I barricadoed myself round
with the chests and boards that I had brought on shore, and
made a kind of but for that night’s lodging. As for food, I yet
saw not which way to supply myself, except that I had seen two
or three creatures, like hares, run out of the wood where I shot
the fowl.
I now began to consider that I might yet get a great many
things out of the-ship, which would be useful to me, and par-
ticularly some of the rigging and sails, and such other things as
might come to land; and I resolved to make another voyage on
40
that blew must necessarily break her all in pieces, I resolved to
set all other things apart, till I got everything out of the ship
that I could get. Then I called a council, that is to say, in my
thoughts, whether I should take back the raft; but this appeared
impracticable: so I resolved to go as before, when the tide was
down; and I did so, only that I stripped before I went from my
but; having nothing on but a chequered shirt, a pair of linen
drawers, and a pair of pumps on my feet.
I got on board the ship as before, and prepared a second raft;
40
unwieldy, nor loaded it so hard, but yet I brought away several
aoamsoN caesos. 41
found two or three bags of nails and spikes, a great screw-jack,
a dozen or two of hatchets; and, above all, that most useful
thing called agrindstone. All these I secured together, with
several things belonging to the gunner; particularly, two or
three iron crows, and two barrels of musket bullets, seven mus-
kets, and another fowling-piece, with some small quantity of
powder more; a large bag full of small shot, and a great roll of
sheet lead; but this last was so heavy, I could not hoist it up
to get it over the ship’s side. Besides these things, I took all
aoamsoN caesos. 41
hammock, and some bedding; and with this I loaded my second
raft, and brought them all safe on shore, to my very great
comfort.
I was under some apprehensions lest, during my absence from
the land, my provisions might be devoured on shore: but when
I came back, I found no sign of any visitor; only there sat a
creature like a wild cat, upon one of the chests, which, when I
came towards it, ran away a little distance, and then stood still.
She sat very composed and unconcerned, and looked full in my
face, as if she had a mind to be acquainted with me. I presented
my gun to her, but, as she did not understand it, she was per-
fectly unconcerned at it, nor did she offer to stir away; upon
which I tossed her a bit of biscuit, though, by the way, I was
not very free of it, for my store was not great; however, I spared
her a bit, I say, and she went to it, smelled of it, and ate it, and
looked (as pleased) for more; but I thanked her, and could spare
aoamsoN caesos. 41
Having got my second cargo on shore—though I was fain to
open the barrels of powder, and bring them by parcels, for they
were too heav , being large casks—I went to work to make me
a little tent, With the sail, and some poles, which I cut for that
purpose; and into this tent I brought every thing that I knew
would'spoil either with rain or sun; and I piled all the empty
chests and casks up in a circle round the tent, to fortify it from
any sudden attempt either from man or beast.
When I had done this, I blocked up the door of the tent with
some boards within, and an empty chest set up on end without;
and spreading one of the beds upon the ground, laying my two
pistols just at my head, and my gun at length by me, I went to
aoamsoN caesos. 41
very weary and heavy; for the night before I had slept little, and
had laboured very hard all day, as well to fetch all those things
from the ship, as to get them on shore.
I had the biggest magazine of all kinds now that ever was laid
aoamsoN caesos. 41
while the ship sat upright in that posture, I thought I ought to
get every thing out of her that I could; so every day, at 10‘
water, I went on board, and brought away something or other:
but particularly the third Q'me I went, I brought away as much
i \ 0f the rigging as I con as also all the small ropes and rope-
? l’ 'V"\ twine I could get, with a piece of spare canvass, which was to
J ' mend the sails upon occasion, and the barrel of wet gunpowder.

I was gain to (illlt t em in pieces, andfbli-ing has maililch gt a time as

But that which comforted me still more was, that, last of all,
'2 ADVENTURES OI
I had nothing more to expect from the shi that was worth my
meddling with; I say, after all this, I foun a great hogshead of
bread, and three large runlets of rum or spirits, and a box of

cause I had given over expecting any more provisrons, except
what was spoiled by the water. I soon emptied the hogshead
of that bread, and wrapped it up, parcel by parcel, in pieces of
the sails, which I out out; and, in a word, I got all this safe on
shore also.
The next day I made another voyage, and now having plun-

I could move, I got two cablé‘swmd a hawser on s ore, with all

able to guide it so handily as I did the other, it overset, and

no great harm, for was near the shore; but as to my cargo,
it was a great part of it lost, especially the iron, which I ex-

tide was out, I got most of the pieces of cable ashore, and some

After this I went every day on board, and brought away what
I could get.

the twelfth time, to go on board, I found the wind began to rise:
however, at low water, I went on board; and though I though!
I had rummaged the cabin so effectually, as that _nothing could
be found, yet I discovered a locker with drawers In it, in one of
which I found two or three razors, and one pair of lar s,
with some ten or a oz 11 0 or s; in another
I found about thirt -six onnds in money, some European coin,

all this heap: Ihave no manner of use for thee; e'en remain
where thou art, and go to the bottom, as a. creature whose life
is not worth saving. However, upon second thoughts, I took
it away; and wrapping all this in a piece of canvass, I began to
think of making another raft; but while I was preparing this, I
found the sky overcast, and the wind began to rise, and in a quar-
ter of an hour it blew a fresh gale from the shore. It presently

with the weight of the things I had about me, and partly the
roughnrss of the water; for the wind rose very hastily, and be-
fore it was quite high water it blew a storm.
But I was got home to my little tent, where I lay, with all
my wealth about me very secure. It blew very hard all that
night, and in the morning, when I looked out, behold no more
ship was to be seen ! I was a little surprised, but recovered my-
nosmsou cnvson. 43
nor abated no diligence, to get everything out of her, that could
be useful to me, and that, indeed, there was little left in her that
I was able to bring away, ifI had had more time.
I now gave over any more thoughts of the ship, or of any-
thing out of her, except what might drive on shore, from her
Wreck; as, indeed, divers pieces of her afterwards did; but those
things were of small use to me.
My thoughts were now wholly employed about securing myself
against either savages, if any should appear, or wild beasts, if
any were in the island; and I had many thoughts of the method
bow to do this, and what kind of dwelling to make, whether I
should make me a cave in the earth, or a tent upon the earth;
and, in short, I resolved upon both; the manner and description
of which, it may not be improper to give an account of.
Isoon found the place I was in was not for my settlement,
particularly because it was upon a low, moorish ground, near
the sea, and I believed it would not be wholesome; and more
particularly because there was no fresh water near it: so I

not willing to banish all my expectation yet.
In search for a place proper for this, I found a little plain on
the side of a rising hill, whose front towards this little plain was
steep as a house-side, so that nothing could come down upon
me from the top. On the side of this rock, there was a hollow
place, worn a little way in, like the entrance or door of a cave;
but there was not really any cave, or way into the rock, at all.

solved to pitch my tent. This plain was not above a hundred
yards broad, and about twice as 'long, and lay like a green be-
fore my door; and, at the end of it, descended irregularly every
way down into the~low ground by the seaside. It was on the
N.N.W. side of the hill; so that it was sheltered from the heat
every day, till it came to a W. and by S. sun, or thereabouts,
which, in those countries, is near the setting.
Before I set up my tent, I drew a half-circle before the hollow
place, which took in about ten yards in its semi-diameter from
the rock, and twenty yards in its diameter, from its beginning
and ending.
In this half-circle I pitched two rows of strong stakes, driving
44 ADVENTURES o!

and sharpened on the top The two rows did not stand above
six inches from one another.
Then I took the pieces of cable which I cut in the ship, and
laid them in rows, one upon another, within the circle, between
these two rows of stakes, up to the top, placing other stakes in
the inside, leaning against them, about two feet and a half high,
like a spur to a post; and this fence was so strong, that neither
man nor beast could get into it or over it. This cost me a great
deal of time and labour, especially to cut the piles in the woods,
bring them to the place, and drive them into the earth.
The entrance into this place I made to be not by a door, but
by a short ladder to go over the top; which ladder, when I was
in, I lifted over after me; and so I was completely fenced in and

secure in the night, which otherwise I could not have done;
though, as it appeared afterwards, there was no need of all this
caution against the enemies that I apprehended danger from.

riches, all my provisions, ammunition, and stores, of which you
have the account above; and I made a large tent, which, to
preserve me from the rains, that in one part of the year are very
violent there, I made double, viz. one smaller tent within, and
one larger tent above it, and covered the uppermost with a large
tarpaulin, which I had saved among the sails.
And now I lay no more for a while in the bed which I had
brought on shore, but in a hammock, which was indeed a very
good one, and belonged to the mate of the ship.
Into this tent I brought all my provisions, and everything that
would spoil by the wet; and having thus enclosed all my goods,
I made up the entrance, which till now I had left open, and so
passed and re assed, as I said, by a short ladder. .
When I ha done this, I began to work my way into the rock,
and bringing all the earth and stones that I dug down out
through my tent, I laid them up within my fence in the nature
of a terrace, so that it raised the ground within about a foot and
a half; and thus I ade me a cave, just behind my tent, which

at one blast, all my powder might be destroyed; on which, not
my defence only, but the providing me food, as I thought, en-

Such impression did this make upon me, that after the storm

and applied myself to make bags and boxes, to separate the

In the interval of time while this was doing, I went out at

would run away as in a terrible fright: but if they were feeding
in the valleys, and I was upon the rocks, they took no notice of
me; from whence I concluded, that by the position of their

one with me, upon my shoulders, the kid followed me quite to
my enclosure; upon which I laid down the dam, and took the
kid in my arms, and carried it over my pale, in hopes to have

of my thoughts about living, which, it may well be supposed,
were not a few.
I had a dismal prospect of my condition; for as I was not
cast away upon that island without being driven, as is said, by a
violent storm quite out of the course of our intended voyage;
and a great way, viz. some hundreds of leagues, out of the
ordinary course of the trade of mankind, I had great reason to
consider it as a determination of Heaven, that in this desolate
place, and in this desolate manner, I should end my life. The
tears would run plentifully down my face when I made these
nonmsou causoz. 47
Providence should thus completely ruin its creatures, and render
them so absolutely miserable; so abandoned without help, so
entirely depressed, that it could hardly be rational to be thank- I
ful for such a life.
But something always returned swift upon me to check these '
thoughts, and to reprove me; and particularly, one day walking
with my gun in my hand, by the sea-side, I was very pensive
upon the subject of my present condition, when reason, as it
were, expostulated with me the other way, thus: Well, you are
in a desolate condition it is true; but, pray remember, where J”
are the rest of you? Did not you come eleven of you into the
boat? Where are the ten’! Why were not they saved, and you
lost? Why were you singled out? Is it better to be here or
them? And then I pointed to the sea. [All evils are to be con-
sidered with the good that is in them, and with what worse
attends them
Then it occurred to me again, how well I was furnished for
my subsistence, and what would have been my case if it had not
happened (which was a hundred thousand to one) that the ship

necessaries of life, or necessaries to supply and procure them!
Particularly, said I aloud (though to myself), what should I
have done without a gun, without ammuniton, without any tools
to make anything, or to work with, without clothes, bedding,
a tent, or any manner of covering? and that now I had all these
18 ADVENTURE! OI
in such a manner as to live without my gun, when my ammu-
nition was spent: so that I had a tolerable view of subsisting,
without any want, as long as I lived; for I considered, from the
beginning, how I would provide for the accidents that might
happen, and for the time that was to come, not only after my
ammunition should be spent, but even after my health or
strength should decay.
I confess, I had not entertained any notion of my ammunition
being destroyed at one blast, I mean my powder being blown
up by lightning; and this made the thoughts of it so surprising
to me, when it lightened and thundered, as I observed just now.
And now being to enter into a melancholy relation of a. scene
of silent life, such, perhaps, as was never heard of in the world
before, I shall take it from its beginning, and continue it in its
order. It was, by my MWer, when, in
the manner as above said, s set foo upon this orrid island;
when the sun being to us in its autumnal equinox was almost

AFTER. I had been there about ten or twelve days, it came into
my thoughts that I should lose my reckoning of time for want

my knife upon a large post, in capital letters; and making it

But it happened, that among the many things which I brought
out of the ship,,in the several voyages which, as above men-
tioned, I made to it, I got several things of less value, but not
at all less useful to me, which I found, some time after, in rum-
maging the chests : as, in particular, pens, ink, and paper;
severa parcels in the captain ’s, mate’s, gunner's, and carpenter's
keeping; three or four compasses, some mathematical instru-
ments, dials, perspectives, charts, and books of navigation; all

of which I huddled together, whether I might want them or no:
also I found three very good Bibles, which came to me in my
cargo from England, and which I had packed up among my
things; some Portuguese books also, and, among them, two or
three popish prayer-books, and several other books, all which I
carefully secured. And I must not forget, that we had in the
ship a dog, and twg cats, of whose eminenthistory I may have
occasion to say somet ing, in its place : for I carried both the
cats with me; and as for the dog, he jumped out of the ship

utmost;' and I shall show that while my ink lasted, I kept
things very eXact, but after that was gone, I could not; for I
could not make any ink, by any means that I could devise.
And this put me in mind that I wanted many things, notwith-
standing all that I had amassed together; and of these, this of
ink was one; as also a spade, pickaxe, and shovel, to dig or
remove the earth; needles, pins, and thread; as for linen, I soon '

pale, or surrounded my habitation. The piles or stakes, which
were as heavy as I could well lift, were a long time in cutting
and preparing in the woods, and more by far, in bringing home;
so that I spent sometimes two days in cutting and bringing
home one of those posts, and a third day in driving it into the
ground; for which purpose, I got a heavy piece of wood at
50 snvzuruass or
which, however, though I found it answer, made driving these
posts or piles very laborious and tedious work. But what need
I have been concerned at the tediousness of anything I had to
do, seeing I had time enough to do it in? nor had I any other
employment, if that had been over, at least that I could foresee,
except the ranging the island to seek for food; which I did, more
or less, every day
I now began to consider seriously my condition, and the sin
cumstance I was reduced to; and I drew up the state of my
affairs in writing, not so much to leave them to any that were
to come after me (for I was like to have but few heirs), as to

my mind: and as my reason began now to master my despon-
dency, I began to comfort myself as well as I could, and to set
the good against the evil, that I might have something to dis-
tinguish my case from worse; and I stated very impartially, likn
51
debtor and creditor, the comforts I enjoyed against the miseries
I suffered, thus :
I am cast1iiinn a horrible, desolate
Island, void of all hope of recovery.
I am singled out and separated, as it
were, from all the world, to be miserable.
I am divided from mankind, a soli-
taire; one banished from human society.
I have no clothes to cover me.
I am without any defence, or means to
resist any violence of man or beast.
I have no soul to speak to, or relieve
me.
But I am all-5m“, ll

But I am singled out too from all the
ship’s crew, to be spared from death; and
He that miraculously saved me from
death, can deliver me from this condition-
But I am not starved, and perishing in
a barren place, affording no sustenance.
But I am in a hot climate. where, if I
had clothes, I could hardly wear them.
But I am cast on an island where I see
no wild beast to hurt me, as I saw on the
west of Africa: and what i! I had been
shipwrecked there!
But God wonderfully sent the ship in
near enough to the shore, that I have got
out so many necessary things, as will
either supply my wants, or enable me to
supply myself, even as long as I live.
Upon the whole, here was an undoubted testimony, that there
was scarce any condition in the world so miserable, but there
was something negative, or something positive, to be thankful
for in it: and let this stand as a direction, from the experience
of the most miserable of all conditions in this world, that we may

set, in the description of good and evil on the credit side of the
account.
Having now brought my mind a little to relish my condition,
and given over looking out to sea, to see if I could spy a ship ; I
say, given over these things, I began to apply myself to accom-
modate my way of living, and to make things as easy to me as
I could.
I have already described my habitatlon, which was a tent
under the side of a rock, surrounded with a strong pale of posts
and cables ; but I might now rather call it a wall, for I raised a
kind of well against it of turfs, about two feet thick on the out-
side: and after some time (I think it was a year and a half) I
raised rafters from it, leaning to the rock, and thatched or
covered it with boughs of trees, and such things as I could get,
to keep out the rain; which I found, at some times of the year,
very violent.
I have already observed how I brought all my goods into this
pale, and into the cave which I had made behind me. But I

which, as they lay in no order, so they took up all my place; I
had no room to turn myself: so I set myself to enlarge my cave,
and work farther into the earth; for it was a loose sand rock,
which yielded easily to the labour I bestowed on it: an when
I found I was pretty safe as to the beasts of prey, I worked side-
ways, to the right hand, into the rock, and then turning to the
rig t again, worked quite out, and made me a door to come out in'
52 anvsmars or
This gave me not only egress and regress, as it were, a back
way to my tent and to my storehouse, but gave me room to
stow my goods.
And now I began to apply myself to make such necessary
things as I found I most wanted, particularly a chair and a
table; for without these I was not able to enjoy the few comforts
I had in the world; I could not write, or eat, or do several thin s
with so much pleasure, without a table: so I went to wor .
And here I must needs observe, that as Wis the substance
and original of the mathematics, so by stating and squaring
everything by reason, and by making the most rational judg-
ment of things, every man may be, in time, master of every
mechanic art. I had never handled a tool in my life; and yet,
in time, by labour, application, and contrivance I found at last,
that I wanted nothing but I could have made, especially if I had
had tools. However, I made abundance of things, even without
tools; and some with no more tools than an adze and a hatchet,
which perhaps were never made that way before, and that with
52 anvsmars or
other way but to cut down a tree, set it on an edge before me,

to be as thin as a plank, and then dub it smooth with my adze.
It is true, by this method, I could make but one board of a whole
tree; but this I had no remedy for but patience, any more than
I had for aprodigious deal of time and labour which it took me
up to make a plank or board: but my time or labour was little
worth, and so it was as well employed one way as another.
However, I made me a table and a chair, as I observed above,

that I brought on my raft from the ship. But when I wrought
out some boards, as above, Imade large shelves, of the breadth
of a foot and a. half, one over another, all along one side of m

to separate every thing at large in their places, that I might
easily come at them. I knocked pieces into the wall of the rock,
to hang my guns, and all things that would hang up: so that
had my cave been seen, it looked like a general magazine of all
necessary things; andI had every thing so ready at my hand,
that it was a great pleasure to me to see all my goods in such

recovering myselfa little, I ran about the shore, wringing my
hands, and beating my head and face, exclaiming at my misery,
and crying out I was undone, undone! till, tired and faint, I was
forced to lie down on the ground to repose; but durst not sleep,
for fear of being devoured."
Some days after this, and after I had been on board the ship
and got all that I could out of her, I could not forbear getting
up to the top of a little mountain, and looking out to sea, in
hopes of seeing a ship: then fancy that, at a vast distance, I
spied a sail, please myself with the hopes of it, and, after look-
ing steadily, till I was almost blind, lose it quite, and sit down
and weep like a child, and thus increase my misery by my folly

having settled my household stuff and habitation, made me a
table and a chair, and all as handsome about me as I could, I
began to keep my journal: of which I shall here give you the

as long as it lasted; for, having no more ink, I was forced to

carried us to some other part 9f the world. I spent great part
of this day in perplexing myself on these things; but, at length,
seeing the ship almost dry, I went upon the sand as near as I

going out with my gun, time of sleep, and time of diversion;
viz. every morning I walked out with my gun for two 0‘ three
hours, if it did not rain; then employed myself to work till about
eleven o'clock; then ate what I had to live on; and from twelve
to two I lay down to sleep, the weather being excessive hot; and
then, in the evening, to work again'. The working part of this
day and the next was wholly employed in making my table, for
I was yet but a very sorry workman: though time and neces-
sity made me a complete natural mechanic soon after, as I
believe they would any one else. '
Nov. 5. This day went abroad with my gun and dog, and

nothing: of every creature that I killed I took off the skins, and
preserved them. Coming back by the seashore, I saw many
sorts of seafowl which I did not understand: but was surprised,
and almost frightened, with two or three seals; which while I
was gazing at them (not well knowing what they were) got into
the sea, and escaped me for that time. .
NOV. 6. After my morning walk, I went to work with my

it long before I learned to mend it.
Nov. 7. Now it began to be settled fair weather. The 7th,
8th, 9th, 10th, and part of the 12th (for the 11th was Sunday,
according to my reckoning), I took wholly up to make me a
chair, and with much ado brought it to a tolerable shape, but
never to please me; and, even in the making, I pulled it in pieces
several times.
NOTE. I soon neglected my keeping Sundays; for, omitting
my mark for them on my post, I forgot which was which.
Nov. 13. This day it rained; which refreshed me exceeding] ,
and cooled the earth: but it was accompanied with terrib e
thunder and lightning, which frightened me dreadfully, for fear
of my powder. As soon as it was over, I resolved to separate
my stock of powder into as many little parcels as possible, that
it might not be in danger.
Nov. 14, 15, 16. These three days I spent in making little
square chests or boxes, which might hold about a pound, or
two pounds at most, of powder: and so, putting the powder in,
I stowed it in places as secure and as remote from one another
as possible. On one of these three days I killed a large bird that
was good to eat; but I knew not what to call it.
Nov. 17. This day I began to dig behind my tent, into the
rock, to make room for my farther convenience.
NOTE. Three things I wanted exceedingly for this work, Viz.
a pickaxe, a shovel, and a wheelbarrow, or basket; so I desisted
from my work, and began to consider how to supply these wants,
and make me some tools. As for a pickaxe, I made use of the
iron crows, which were proper enough, though heavy: but the
next thing was a shovel or spade; this was so absolutely neces-
sary, that, indeed, I could do nothing effectually without it; but
what kind of one to make I knew not.
Nov. 18. The next day, in searching the woods, I found a
tree of that wood, or like it, which- in the Brazils, they call the
"son from its exceeding hardness: of this, with great labour,
an almost spoiling my axe, I cut a piece; and brought it home,
ROBINSON causoe. 6‘!
excessive hardness of the wood, and my having no other way,
made me a long while upon this machine: for I worked it effec-
tually, by little and little, into the form of a shovel or spade;
the handle exactly shaped like ours in England, only that the
broad part having no iron shod upon it at bottom, it would not
last me so long: however, it served well enough for the uses
which I had occasion to put it to; but never was a shovel, I
believe, made after that fashion, or so long in making.
ROBINSON causoe. 6‘!
A basket I could not make by any means, having no such things
as twigs that would bend to make wicker ware; at least, none
yet found out: and as to the wheelbarrow, I fancied I could
make all but the wheel, but that I had no notion of; neither did
I know how to go about it: besides, I had no possible way to
make iron gudgeons for the spindle or axis of the wheel to run
in; so I gave it over: and, for carrying away the earth which
I dug out of the cave, I made me a thing like a bed, which the
labourers carry mortar in for the bricklayers. This was not so

barrow, took me up no less than four days; I mean, always
excepting my morning walk with my gun, which I seldom
omitted, and very seldom failed also bringing home something

Nov. 23. My other work having now stood still, because of
ROBINSON causoe. 6‘!
working every day, as my strength and time allowed, I spent
eighteen da s entirely in widening and deepening my cave, that
it might ho d my goods commodiously.
NOTE. During all this time, I worked to 'make this room or
cave, spacious enough to accommodate me as a warehouse, or
magazine, a kitchen, a dining-room, and a cellar. As for a lodg—
ing, I kept to the tent: except that sometimes, in the wet season
of the year, it rained so hard that I could not keep myself dry;
which caused me afterwards to cover all my place within my
pale with long poles, and in the form of rafters, leaning against _-

DECEMBER 10. I began now to think my cave or vault

a great quantity of earth fell down from the top and one side;
so much, that, in short, it frightened me, and not without reason
too; for if I had been under it, I should never have wanted a
ave-digger. Upon this disaster, I had a great deal of work to

more I had the roof secured; and the posts, standing in rows,
served me for partitions to part off my house.
DEC. 17. From this day to the 30th, I placed shelves, and
knocked up nails \on the posts, to hang everything up that could
be hung up : and now I began to be in some order within doors.
DEC. 20. I carried everything into the cave, and began to
furnish my house, and set up some pieces of boards, like a
dresser, to order my victuals upon; but boards began to be very
scarce with me : also I made me another table.
DEC. 24. Much rain all night and all day : no stirring out.
DEC. 25. Rain all day.
DEC. 26. No rain; and the earth much cooler than before,
and pleasanter. .
DEC. 27. Killed a young goat; and lamed another, so that
I catched it, and led it home in a string: when I had it home,
I bound and splintered up its leg, which was broke.
N. B. I took such care of it that it lived; and the leg grew
well, and as strong as ever: but, by nursing it so long, it grew
tame, and fed upon the little green at my door, and would not

my powder and shot was all spent.
DEC. 28, 29, 30, 31. Great heats, and no breeze; so that there
was no stirring abroad, except in the evening, for food; this
time I spent in putting all my things in order within doors.
JANUARY 1. Very hot still; but I went abroad early and late
with my gun, and lay still in the middle of the day. This even-
ing, going farther into the valleys which lay towards the centre
of the island, I found there was plenty of goats, though exceed-
ing shy, and hard to come at; however, I resolved to try if I
could not bring my dog to hunt them down. Accordingly, the
next day, I went out with my dog, and set him upon the goats:
but I was mistaken, for they all faced about upon the dog: and
he knew his danger too well, for he would not come near them.
JAN. 3. I began my fence or wall; which, being still jealous
of my being attacked by somebody, I resolved to make very
thick and strong.

with a turf wall raised up close to it, I persuaded myself that if
any people were to come on shore there they would not perceive
anything like a habitation: and it was very well I did so, as
may be observed hereafter, upon a very remarkable occasion.
During this time, I made my rounds in the woods for game
every day, when the rain permitted me, and made frequent dis-
coveries, in these walks, of something or other to my advantage;
particularly, I found a kind of wild pigeons, who build, not as
wood-pigeons, in a tree, but rather as house-pigeons, in the.
holes of the rocks : and, taking some young ones, I endeavoured
to breed them up tame, and did so; but when they grew older,

of them, it was: for instance, I could never make a cask to be
hooped. I had a small runlet or two, as I observed before; but
I could never arrive at the capacity of making one by them,
though I spent many weeks about it: I could neither put in the
heads, nor join the staves so true to one another as to make
them hold water; so I gave that also over, In the next place,
I was at a great loss for candle; so that as soon as it was dark,
which was generally by seven o’clock, I was obliged to go to
bed. I remember the lump of bees-wax with which I made
candles in my African adventure; but I had none of that now:
the only remedy I had was, that when I had killed a goat, I
saved the tallow; and with a little dish made of clay, which
I baked in the sun, to which I added a wick of some oakum,
I made me a lamp; and this gave me light, though not a clear
steady light like a candle. In the middle of all my labours it
happened, that in rummaging my things, I found a little bag;

1 saw nothing in the bag but husks and dust: and being willing
to have the bag for some other use (I think it was to put pow-
der in, when I divided it for fear of the lightning, or some such
use), I shook the husks of corn out of it, on one side of my
$0 ADVENTURE 0!
It was a little before the great rain just now mentioned, that
I threw this stuff away; taking no notice of anything, and not
so much as remembering that I had thrown anything there;
when, about a month after, I saw some few stalks of something
green, shooting out of the ground, which I fancied might be
some plant I had not seen; but I was surprised, and perfectly
astonished, when, after a little longer time, I saw about ten or
twelve ears come out, which were perfect green barley, of the
same kind as our European, nay, as our English barley.
It is impossible to express the astonishment and confusion of
m thoughts on this occasion. I had hitherto acted upon no
re igious foundation at all: indeed, I had very few notions of
religion in my head, nor had entertained any sense of any things
that had befallen me, otherwise than as chance, or, as we lightly
say, what pleases God; without so much as inquiring into the
end of Providence in these things, or his order in governing
events in the world. But after I saw barley grow there, in a
climate which I knew was not proper for corn, and especially
as I knew not how it came there, it startled me strangely; and
I began to suggest, that God had miraculously caused this grain
to grow without any help of seed sown, and that it was so
directed purely for my sustenance, on that wild miserable place.
This touched my heart a little, and brought tears out of my
eyes; and I began to bless myself that such a prodigy of nature
should happen upon my account: and this was the more strange
to me, because I saw near it still, all along by the side of the
rock, some other straggling stalks, which proved to be stalks of
rice, and which I knew, because I had seen it grow in Africa,
when I was ashore there.
I not only thought these the pure productions of Providence
for my support, but, not doubting that there was more in the
place, I went over all that part of the island where I had been
before, searching in every corner, and under every rock, for

thoughts, that I had shook out a bag of chicken's-meat in that
place, and then the wonder began to cease; and I must confess,
my religious thankfulness to God's providence began to abate
too, upon the discovering that all this was nothing but what
was common; though I ought to have been as thankful for so
strange and unforeseen a providence, as if it had been miracu-
lous: for it was really the work of Providence, as to me, that

If it had been dropped from heaven; as also, 'that I should throw
it out in that particular place, where, it being in the shade of a
nigh rock, it sprang up immediately; whereas, if I had thrown
it anywhere else, at that time, it would have been burned up
and estroyed.
I carefully saved the ears of this corn, you may be sure, in
their season, which was about the end of June; and, laying up
every corn, I resolved to sow them all again; hoping, in time, , '

before the dry season, so that it never came up at all, at least
not as it would have done ; of which in its place.
Besides this barley, there were, as above, twenty or thirty
stalks of rice, which I preserved with the same care; and Whose
use was of the same kind, or to the same purpose, viz., to make
me bread, or rather food; for I found ways to cook it up without
baking, though I did that also after some time.—But to return
to my Journal.
I worked excessively hard these three or four months, to get
my wall done; and the 14th of April I closed it up ; contriving
to get into it, not by a door, but over the wall, by a ladder, that
there might be no sign on the outside of my habitation. _

all my labour overthrown at once, and myself killed; the case
was thus :—As I was busy in the inside of it, behind my tent,
just at the entrance into my cave, I was terribly frightened with
a most dreadful surprising thing indeed; for, all on a sudden, I
found the earth come crumbling down from the roof of my cave,
and from the edge of the hill over my head, and two of the posts
I had set up in the cave cracked in a frightful manner. I was
heartily scared; but thought nothing of what really was the
cause, only thinking that the top of my cave was falling in, as
some of it had done before: and for fear I should be buried in ,, ’p
it, I ran forward to my ladder, and not thinking myself safe there (r l, >, .

earthquake: for the ground I stood on shook three times at
about eight min-:tes' distance, with three such shocks as would
have overturned the strongest building that could be supposed
r 2
to have stood on the earth; and a great piece of the top of a
rock, which‘stood about half a mile from me, next the sea, fell
down with such a terrible noise as I never heard in all my life.
I perceived also that the very sea was put into a violent motion
by it; and I believe the shocks were stronger under the water
than on the island.
I was so much amazed with the thing itself (having never felt
the like, nor discoursed with any one_that had) that I was like
i: anvssrunrs or
stomach sick, like one that was tossed at sea: but the noise of
the falling of the rock awaked me, as it were; and rousing me
i: anvssrunrs or
I thought of nothing but the hill falling upon my tent and my
household goods, and burying all at once; this sunk my very
soul within me a. second time.
After the third shock was over, and I felt no more for some
time, I began to take courage; yet I had not heart enough to go
over my wall again, for fear of being buried alive; but sat still
upon the ground greatly cast down, and disconsolate, not know-
ing what to do. All this while I had not the least serious reli-
gious thought; nothing but the common Lord, have mercy upon
me! and when it was over that went away too.
While I sat thus, I found the air overcast, and grow cloudy, as
if it would rain; and soon after the wind rose by little and little,
so that in less than half an hour it blew a most dreadful hurri-
cane: the sea was, all on a sudden, covered with foam and froth;
the shore was covered with abreach of the water; the trees were
torn up by the roots; and a terrible storm it was. This held
about three hours, and then began to abate; and in two hours
more it was quite calm, and began to rain very hard. All this

when, on a sudden, it came into my thoughts that these winds
and rain being the consequence of the earthquake, the earthquake
itself was spent and over, and I might venture into my care
again. With this thought my spirits began to revive; and the
rain also helping to persuade me, I went in, and sat down in my
tent; but the rain was so violent, that my tent was ready to be
beaten down with it; and I was forced to get into my cave,
though very much afraid and uneasy, for fear it should fall on
my head. This violent rain forced me to a new work, viz., to cut
i: anvssrunrs or
go out, which would else have drowned my cave. After I had
been in my cave for some time, and found no more shocks of the
earthquake follow, I began to be more composed. And now, to
support my spirits, which indeed wanted it very much, I went to
my little store, and took a small cup of rum; which, however,
I did then, and always, very sparingly, knowing I could have n.»
more when that was gone. It continued raining all that night,
and great part of the next day, so that I could not stir abroad:
but my mind being more composed, I began to think of what I
had best do; concluding, that if the island was subject to these
earthquakes, there would be no living for me in a cave, but I
must consider of building me some little but in an open place,
which I might surround with a wall, as I had done here, and so
make myself secure from wild beasts or men: forif I staid where
I was, I should certainly, one time or other, be buried alive.
With these thoughts, I resolved to remove my tent from the
place where it now stood, being just under the hanging precipice
of the hill, and which, if it should be shaken again, would cer-
tainly fall upon my tent. I spent the two next days, being the
19th and 20th of April, in contriving where and how to remove

so, that I never slept in quiet; and yet the apprehension of lying
abroad, without any fence, was almost equal to it: but still, when
I looked about, and saw how eVery thing was put in order, how
pleasantly I was concealed, and how safe from danger, it made
me very loath to remove. In the mean time, it occurred to me
that it would require a vast deal of time for me to do this; and
that I must be contented to run the risk where I was, till I had
formed a convenient camp, and secured it so as to remove to it.
With this conclusion I composed myself for a time; and resolved
that I would go to work with all speed to build me a wall with
piles and cables, &c., in a circle as before, and set up my tent in

APRIL 2 e next morning I began to consider of means to
put this measure into execution; but Iwas at a great loss about
the tools. I had three large axes, and abundance of hatchets
ROBINSON CRUSOI. 68
with much chopping and cutting knotty hard wood, they were
all full of notches, and dull: and though I had a grindstone, I
could not turn it and grind my tools too. This caused me as
much thought as a statesman would have bestowed upon a grand
oint of politics, are judge upon the life and death of a man. At
ength I contrived awheel with a string, to turn it with my foot,
that I might have both my hands at liberty.
NOTE. I had never seen any such thing in England, or at least
not to take notice how it was done, though since I have observed
it is very common there: besides that, my grindstone was very
large and heavy. This machine cost me a full week‘s work to bring
it to perfection.

ILLNESS AND AFFLICTION.
MAY l.,,/In the morning, looking towards the seaside, the tide
bwglow, I saw something lie 'on the shore bigger than ordinary,
End it looked like a cask: when I came to it, I found a small
barrel. and two or three pieces of the wreck of the ship, which
were driven on shore by the late hurricane; and looking towards
the wreck itself, I thought it seemed to lie higher out of the water
than it used to do. I examined the barrel that was driven on
shore, and soon found it was a barrel of gunpowder; but it had
taken water, and the powder was caked as hard as a stone: how-
ever, I rolled it farther on the shore for the present, and went on
upon the sands, as near as I could to the wreck of the ship, to
look for more.
When I came down to the ship, I found it strangely removed.
The forecastle, which lay before buried in the sand, was heaved
up at least six feet: and the stern (which was broke to pieces,
and parted from the rest, by the force of the sea, soon after I had
left rummaging of her) was tossed, as it were, up, and cast on
one side: and the sand was thrown so high on that side next her
stern, that I could now walk quite up to her when the tide was
out; whereas there was a great piece of water before, so that I
could not come within a quarter of a mile of the wreck without
64 ADVENTURE? or
it must be done by the earthquake; and as by this violence the
ship was more broken open than formerly, so many things came
daily on shore, which the sea had loosened, and which the Winds
and water rolled by degrees to the land,
This wholly diverted my thoughts from the design of removing
my habitation; and I busied myself mightily, that day especially,
in searching whether I could make any way into the ship : but
I found nothing was [0 be eXpected of that kind, for all the inside
of the ship was choked up with sand. However, as 1 had learned
not to despair of anything, resolved to pull every thing to pieces
I that I could of the ship, concluding that every thing I could get
from her would be of some use or other to me.

MAY 7. Went to the wreck again, but not with an intent to
work; but found the weight of the wreck had broke itself down,
the beams being cut; that several pieces of the ship seemed to
lie loose; and the inside of the hold lay so open that I could
see into it; but almost full of water and sand.
MAY 8. Went to the wreck, and carried an iron crow to
wrench up the deck, which lay now quite clear of the water and
sand. I wrenched up two planks, and brought them on shore
also with the tide. I left the iron crow in the wreck for next

Ill/IAY 9. Went to the wreck, and with the crow made way
into the body of the wreck, and felt several casks, and loosened
them with the crow, but could not break them up. I felt also a

remove.

driving it With the other; but as it lay about a foot and a half

a great distance, two miles off me, but resolved to see what they
were, and found it was a piece of the head, but too heavy for
me to bring away.

nothing came to land that day but pieces of timber, and a hogs-
head, which had some Brazil pork in it; but the salt water and
the sand had spoiled it. I continued this work every day to the
15th of June, except the time necessary to get food; which 1
always appointed, during this part of my employment, to be
when the tide was up, that I might be ready when it was ebbed
out: and by this time I had gotten timber, and plank, and iron
work, enough to have built a good boat, if I had known how:
and I also got. at several times, and in several pieces, near one

and neither ate nor drank. I was ready to perish for thirst:
but so weak, I had not strength to stand up, or to get myself
any water to drink. Prayed to God again, but was light-headed:

refreshed, but weak, and exceeding thirsty: however, as I had
no water in in whole habitation, I was forced to lie till morning,
and went to s eep again. In this second sleep I had this terrible
dream: I thought that I was sitting on the ground, on the outside
of my wall, whereI sat when the storm blew after the earth uake, _
and that I saw a man descend from a great black cloud, in a

with his feet, I thought the earth trembled, just as it had done
before in the earthquake; and all the air looked, to my ap re-

sooner landed upon the earth, but he moved forward towards
me, with a long spear or weapon in his hand, to kill me; and
when he came to a rising ground, at some distance, he spoke to
me, or I heard a voice so terrible that it is impossible to express
the terror of it; all that I can say I understood, was this:
Seeing all these things have not brought thee to repentance,
now thou shalt die; at which words, I thought he lifted up the
spear that was in his hand, to kill me.
No one that shall ever read this account, will expect that I
should be able to describe the horrors of my soul at this terrible
vision; I mean, that even while it was a dream, I even dreamed
of those horrors; nor is it any more possible to describe the
impression that remained upon my mind when I awaked, and
found it was but a dream.
I had, alas! no divine knowledge: what I had received by the
good instruction of my father was then worn out, by an uninter-
rupted series, for eight years, of seafaring wickedness, and a
constant conversation with none but such as were, like myself.

whelmed me; and I was all that the most hardened, unthinking,
wicked creature among our common sailors, can be supposed to
be; not having the least sense. either of the fear of God, in
danger, or of thankfulness to him, in deliverances.
In the relating what is already art of my story, this will be
the more easily believed, when I s all add, that through all the
variety of miseries that had to this da befallen me, I never had
so much as one thought of its being t e hand of God, or that it
was a just punishment for my sin; either my rebellious behaviour
against my father, or my present sins, which were great; or even
as a punishment for the general course of my wicked life. W hen
I was on the desperate expedition on the desert shores of Africa,
I never had so much as one thought of what would become of
me; or one wish to God to direct me whither I should go, or to
keep me from the danger which apparently surrounded me, as
well from voracious creatures as cruel savages: but I was quite
thoughtless of a God or a Providence; acted like a mere brute,
from the principles of natu e, and by the dictates of common
sense only; and indeed bar that. When I was delivered and
taken up at sea by the Portuguese captain, well used, and dealt
with justly and honourably, as well as charitably, I had not the
least thankfulness in my thoughts. When, again, I was ship-
wrecked, ruined, and in danger of drowning, on this island, I
was as far from remorse, or looking on it as a judgment: I only
said to myself often, that I was an unfortunate dog, and born to
be always miserable.

sort of joy which seamen generally have, after they are got
safe ashore from a shipwreck; which they drown all in the next
bowl of punch, and forget almost as soon as it is over: and all
the rest of my life was like it. Even when I was, afterwards, on
due consideration, made sensible of my condition,—how I was
cast on this dreadful place, out of the reach of human kind, out
of all hope of relief, or prospect of redemption,--as soon as I
saw but a prospect of living, and that I should not starve and

view of the miseries of death came to place itself before me;
when my spirits began to sink under the burden of a strong
distemper, and nature was exhausted with the violence of the
fever; conscience, that had slept so long, began to awake; and
I reproached myself with my past life, in which I had so evi-

well of the fever as of the dreadful reproaches of my conscience,
extorted from me some words like praying to God: though I
cannot say it was a prayer attended either with desires or with
hopes; it was rather the voice of mere fright and distress. My
thoughts were confused; the convictions great upon my mind;
and the horror of dying in such a miserable condition, raised
vapours in my head with the mere apprehension: and, in these
hurries of my soul, I knew not what my tongue might express;
but it was rather exclamation, such as, Lord, what a miserable
creature am I! If I should be sick, I shall certainly die for want
of help; and what will become of me? Then the tears burst out
of my eyes, and I could say no more for a good while. In this
interval, the good advice of my father came to my mind, and

had mercifully put me in a station of life wherein I might have
been happy and easy; but I would neither see it myself, not
learn from my parents to know the blessing of it. I left them
to mourn over my folly; and now I am left to mourn under the
consequences of it: I refused their help and assistance, who

water, I put about a quarter of a pint of rum into it, and mixed

but was very weak, and withal very sad and heavy-hearted in
the sense of my miserable condition, dreading the return of my
distemper the next day. At night, I made my supper of three
of the turtle's eggs, which I roasted in the ashes, and ate, as we

asked God's blessing to, as I could remember, in my whole life.
After I had eaten, I tried to walk; but found myself so weak,
that I could hardly carry the gun (for I never went out without
that); so I went but a little way, and sat down upon the ground,
looking out upon the sea, which was just before me, and very
calm and smooth. As I sat here, some such thoughts as these
occurred to me: What is this earth and sea, of which Ihave
seen so much? Whence is it produced? And what am I, and
all the other creatures, wild and tame, human and brutal?
Whence are wet Surely, we are all made by some secret power,
who formed the earth and sea, the air and sky. And who is
that? Then it followed most naturally, It is God that has made
all. Well, but then, it came on, if God has made all these things,
. he guides and governs them all, and all things that concern
them; for the power that could make all things, must certainly
have power to guide and direct them: if so, nothing can happen
in the great circuit of his works, either without his knowledge
or appointment.
And if nothing happens without his knowledge, he knows
that I am here, and am in this dreadful condition: and if nothing
happens without his appointment, he has appointed all this to
befal me. Nothing occurred to my thought, to contradict any
of these conclusions; and therefore it rested upon me with the
greatest force, that it must needs be that God had appointed all
this to befal me; that I was brought to thi miserable circum-
stance by his direction, he having the sole power, not of me only,
but of everything that happens in the world. Immediately it
followed, Why has God done this to me? What have I done to be
thus used? My conscience presently checked me in that inquiry,
as if I had blasphemed: and methought it spoke to me like a
voice! Wretch, dost thou ask what thou hast done? Look back
upon a dreadful mispent life, and ask thyself what thou hast not
done? Ask, why is it that thou wert not long ago destroyed?
Why wert thou not drowned in Yarmouth Roads; killed in the

to myself; and, rising up pensive and sad, walked back to my
retreat, and went over my wall, as if I had been going to bed:

to sleep; so I sat down in the chair, and lighted my lamp, for it
began to be dark. Now, as the apprehension of the return of

I went, directed by Heaven, no doubt: for in this chest I found
a cure both for soul and body. I opened the chest, and found
what I looked for, viz., the tobacco; and as the few books I had
saved lay there too, I took out one of the Bibles which I men-
tioned before, and which, to this time, I had not found leisure or so

were these : “ Call on me in the day of trouble, and I will deliver
thee, and thou shalt glorify Inc." These words were very apt to
my case; and made some impression upon my thoughts at the
time of readlng them, though not so much as they did afterwards;
for, as for being delivered, the word had no sound, as I may say, to
me; the thing was so remote, so impossible in my apprehension
of things, that, as the children of Israel said when they were pro-

so I began to say, Can even God himself deliver me from this
place? And as it was not for many years that any hopes
appeared, this prevailed very oftcnupon my thoughts: but, how-
ever, the words made a great impression upon me, and I mused
upon them very often. It now grew late: and the tobacco had, as
Isaid, dozed my head so much, that I inclined to slec : so I left
my lamp burning in the cave, lest I should want anyt ing in the
night, and went to bed. But before I lay down, I did what I
never had done in all my life: I kneeled down, and prayed to God

prayer was over, I drank the rum in which I had steeped the
tobacco ; which was so strong and rank of the tobacco, that
indeed I could scarce get it down; immediately upon this I went

lost a day in my account, and never knew which way. Be that,

The 30th was my well day, of course; and Iwent abroad with

two, something like a brand goose, and brought them home; but
was not very forward to eat them; so I ate some more of the
turtle's eggs, which were very good. This evening I renewed the
medicine, which I had supposed did me good the day before, viz.
the tobacco steeped in rum; only 1 did not take so much as

gathering strength, my thoughts ran exceedingly upon this
Scripture, “I will deliver thee ;” and the impossibility of my de-
liverance lay much upon my mind, in bar of my ever expecting it:
but as I was discouraging myself with such thoughts, it occurred
to my mind that I pored so much upon my deliverance from

tions as these, viz. Have I not been delivered, and wonderfully,

of it? Have I done my part? God ha delivered me, but I have

thankful for that as a deliverance: and how can I expect a greater
deliverance? This touched my heart very much; and imme-
diately I knelt down, and gave God thanks aloud for my recovery
from my sickness.
JULY 4. In the morning I took the Bible; and beginning at
the New Testament, I began seriously to read it; and imposed
upon myself to read a while every morning and every night; not
binding myself to the number of chapters, but as long as my
thoughts should engage me. It was not long after I set seriously
to this work, that I found my heart more deeply and sincerely
affected with the wickedness of my past life. The impression of
my dream revived; and the words, All theso things have not
brought thee to repentance, ran seriously in my thoughts. I
was earnestly begging of God to give me repentance. when it
happened providentially, the very same day, that, reading the
scripture, I came to these words, “He is exalted a Prince and.
Saviour; to give repentance and to give remission.” I threw
down the book; and with my heart as well as my hands lifted up
to heaven, in a kind of ecstasy of joy, I cried out aloud, Jesus,

say, in the true sense of the words, that I prayed; for now I
prayed with a sense of m -condition, and with a true scripture
view of hope, founded on t e encouragement of the word of God:
and from this time, I may say, I began to have hope that God
would hear me.
Now I began to construe the words mentioned above, “ Call on
me, and I will deliver thee,” in a different sense from what I had
ever done before; for then I had no notion of anything being
called deliverance, but my being delivered from the captivity I was
in: for though I was indeed at large in the place, yet the island
was certainly a prison to me, and that in the worst sense in the
world. But now I learned to take it in another sense: now I
looked back upon my past life with such horror, and my sins
appeared so dreadful, that my soul sought nothing of God but
deliverance from the load of guilt that bore down all my comfort.
As for my solitary life, it was nothing; I did not so much as pray
to be delivered from it, or think of it; it was! all of no consider-
ation, in com arison with this. And I add this part here, to hint
to whoever s all read it, that whenever they come to a true sense

My condition began now to be, though not les miserable as to
my way of living, yet much easier to my mind: and my thoughts
being directed, by constantly reading the scripture and praying to
God, to things of a higher nature, I had a great deal of comfort
within, which, till now, I knew nothing of ; also, as my health and
strength returned, I bestirred me to furnish myself with every-

was no more than a little brook of running water, very fresh and
good : but this being the dry season, there was hardly any water
in some parts of it; at least, not any stream. On the banks of
this brook I found many pleasant savannahs or meadows, plain,
smooth, and covered with grass; and on the rising parts of them,
next to the higher grounds (where the water, as it might be

were divers other plants, which I had no knowledge of, or under-

distress.
The next day, the 16th, I went up the same way again ; and
after going something farther than I had gone the day before, I
found the brook and the savannahs begin to cease, and the
country become more woody than before. In this part I found
different fruits; and particularly I found melons upon the ground
in great abundance. and grapes upon the trees: the vines, indeed,
had spread over the trees, and the clusters of grapes were now
just in their prime, very ripe and rich. This was a surprising
discovery, and I was exceedingly glad of them, but I was warned
by my experience to eat sparingly of them; remembering that

them as dried grapes or raisins are kept; which I thought would
be (as indeed they were) as wholesome and as agreeable to eat,

and got up into a tree, whereI slept well; and the next morning
roceeded on my discovery, travelling near four miles, as I might
Judge by the length of the valley: keeping still due north, with
a ridge of hills on the south and north sides of me. At the end
of this march I came to an opening, where the country seemed
to descend to the west; and a little spring of fresh water, which
issued out at the side of the hill by me, ran the other way, that
is, due east; and the country appeared so fresh, so green, so

cocoa-trees, and orange, lemon, and citron trees, but all wild,
and very few ‘bearing any fruit; at least not then. However,
the green limes that I gathered were not only pleasant to eat,
but very wholesome; and I mixed their juice afterwards with
water, which made it very wholesome, and very cool and re~

carry home; and I resolved to lay up a store, as well of grapes
as limes and lemons, to furnish myself for the wet season, which
I knew was approaching. In order to this, I gathered a great
heap of grapes in one place, a lesser heap in another place; and
a great parcel of limes and lemons in another place; and taking
a few of each with me, I travelled homeward; and resolved to
come again, and bring a bag or sack, or what I could make, to
carry the rest home. Accordingly, having spent three da 's in
this journey, I came home (so I must now call my tent an my
cave): but before I got thither, the grapes were spoiled; the rich-
ness of the fruits, and the weight of the juice, having broken and
bruised them, they were good for little or nothing: as to the
limes, they were good, but I could bring on] a few.

two small bags to bring home my harvest; but I was surprised,

eaten and devoured. By this I concluded there were some wild
creatures thereabouts which had done this, but what they were
I knew not. However, as I found there was no laying them up
in heaps, and no carrying them away in a sack; but that one
way they would be destroyed, and the other way they would be
crushed with their own weight; I took another course: I then
gathered a large quantity of the gra es, and hung them upon
the out-branches of the trees, that t ey might cure and dry in
the sun; and as for the limes and lemons, I carried as many
back as I could well stand under.
When I came home from this journey, I contemplated with
great pleasure the fruitfulness of that valley, and the pleasant-
ness of the situation; the security from storms on that side; the
water and the wood; and concluded that I had pitched upon a
'18 ADVENTI ass or
country. Upon the whole, I began to consider of removing my
habitation, and to look out for a place equally safe as where I
was now situate; if possible, in that pleasant fruitful part of the
island.
This thought ran long in my head; and I was exceeding fond
of it for some time, the pleasantness of; the iplace tempting me:
but when I came to a nearer view of it, 'I considered that I was
now by the seaside, where it was at least possible that some-
thing might happen to my advantage, and, by the same ill-fate
that brought me hither, might bring some other unhappywretches
to the same place; and though it was scarce probable that any
such thing should ever happen, yet to enclose myself among the
hills and woods in the centre of the island, was to anticipate my
'18 ADVENTI ass or
piossible; and that therefore I ought not by any means to remove.
owever, I was so enamoured of this place, that I spent much
of my time there for the whole remaining part of the month of
July; and though, upon second thoughts, I resolved, as above
stated, not to remove, yet I built me a little kind of a bower,
and surrounded it at a distance with a strong fence, being a

two or three nights together; always going over it with a ladder,
as before: so that I fancied now I had my country and my sea-

bower, and began to enjoy myself. The 3d of August, I found
the grapes I had hung up were perfectly dried, and indeed were
excellent good raisins of the sun; so I began to take them down
from the trees; and it was very happy that I did so, as the rains
which followed would have spoiled them, and I should have lost
the best part of my winter food; for I had above two hundred
large bunches of them. No sooner had I taken them all down,
an carried most of them home to my cave, but it began to rain:
and from hence, which was the 14th of August, it rained, more
or less, every day till the middle of October; and sometimes so
violently, that I could not stir out of my cave for several days.
In this season, I was much surprised with the increase of my
family. Ihad been concerned for the loss of one of my cats,
who ran away from me, or, as I thought, had been dead; and L
heard no more of her, till, to my astonishment, she came home
with three kittens. This was the more strange to me, because,
about the end of August, though I had killed a wild cat, as I
called it, with my gun, yet I thought it was quite a different kind
from our European cats: yet the young cats were the same kind
of house-breed as the old one; and both of my cats being females,
I thought it very strange. But from these three, I afterwards
came to be so pestered with cats that I was forced to kill them
like vermin, or wild beasts, and to drive them from my house
as much as possible.
From the 14th of August to the 26th, incessant rain; so that
I could not stir, and was now very careful not to be much wet.

During this con nement in my cover from the rain, I worked

perfectly easy at lying so open: for as I had managed myself
efore, I was in a perfect enclosure; whereas now, I thought I
lay exposed; and yet I could not perceive that there was any
living thing to fear, the biggest creature that I had as yet seen
upon the island being a goat.

had, after some time, omitted to distinguish the weeks, by making
a longer notch than ordinary for the sabbath-day, and so did not
really know what any of the days were: but now having cast up
the days, as above, I found I had been there a year; so 1 divided
it into weeks, and set apart every seventh day for a sabbath:
though I found, at the end of my account, I had lost a day or two
in my reckoning. A little after this, my ink beginning to fail me,
I contented myself to use it more sparingly; and to write down
only the most remarkable events of my life, without continuing
a daily memorandum of other things.
The rainy season and the dry season began now to appear
regular to me, and I learned to divide them so as to provide for
them accordingly; but I bought all my experience before I had
it; and what I am going to relate, was one of the most dis-
couraging experiments that I had made at all.
I have mentioned that I had saved a few ears of barley, and
rice, which I had so surprisingly found sprung up, as I thought,
of themselves. I believe there were about thirty stalks of rice,
and about twenty of barley; and now I thought it a proper time
to sow it after the rains; the sun being in its southern position,
oing from me. Accordingly Idug apiece of ground, as well as
could, with my wooden spade; and dividing it into two parts,
I sowed my grain; but as I was sowing, it casually occurred to

not know when was the proper time for it; so I sowed about two-
thirds of the seed, leaving about a handful of each: and it was
a great comfort to me afterwards that I did so, for not one grain
of what I sowed this time came to anything; for the dry month
following, and the earth having thus had no rain after the seed
was sown, it had no moisture to assist its growth, and never
came up at all till the wet season had come again, and then

seed did not grow, which I easily imagined was from the
drought, I sought for a moister piece of ground to make
another trial in; _and I dug up a piece of ground near my new
bower, and sowed the rest of my seed in February, a little
before the vernal equinox. This having the rainy months of
March and April to water it, sprung up very pleasantly, and
yielded a very good crop; but having only part of the seed left,
and not daring to sow all that I had, I got but a small quantit

kind. Butby this experiment I was made masts at my busmess,
and knew exactly when was the proper time to sow; and that I
might expect two seed-times, and two harvests, every year.
While this corn was growing, I made a little discovery, which
was of use to me afterwards. As soon as the rains were over,
and the weather began to settle, which was about the month of
November, I made a. visit up the country to my bower; where,
though I had not been for some months, yet I found all things
just as I had left them. The circle or double hedge that I had

ROBINSON MAKES A TOUR TO EXPLORE HIS ISLAND—EMPLOYED
IN BASKET-MAKING.
I FOUND now that the seasons of the year might generally be
divided, not into summer and winter as in Europe, but into the
rainy seasons and the dry seasons, which were generally thus:
From the middle of February to the middle of April, rainy; the
sun being then on or near the equinox. From the middle of April
till the middle of August, dry; the sun being then north of the
Line. From the middle of August till the middle of October,
rainy; the sun being then come back to the Line. From the
middle of October till themiddlo of February, dry; the sun being
then to the south of the Line.
The rainy seasons held sometimes longer and sometimes
shorter, as the winds happened to blow; but this was the general
observation I made. Alter I had found, by experience, the ill
consequences of being abroad in the rain, I took care to furnish
myself with provisions beforehand, that I might not be obliged to
go out; and I sat within donrs as much as possible during the
wet months. This time I found much employment, and very
suitable also to the time; for I found great occasion for many
things which I had no way to furnish myself with but by hard
labour and constant application: particularly, I tried many ways
to make myself a basket: but all the twigs I could get for the
purpose proved so brittle that they would do nothing It proved
of excellent advantage to me now. that when l was a boy,
I used to take great delight in standing at a basket-maker's in the
town where my father lived, to see them make their wicker-ware;
82 Anvnu-rrmms m
observer ofthe manner how they worked those things, and some-
Junes lending a hand, I had by these means full knowledge of the

methods of it, so that I wanted nothing but the materials; when
it came into my mind, that the twigs of that tree from w hence I cut
my stakes that grew might possibly be as tough as the sallows,
vnllows, and osiers, in England; and I resolved to try. Accord-
ingly, the next day,l went to my country-house, as I called it; and
cutting some of the smaller twigs, I found them to my purpose as
much as Icould desire: whereupon I came the next time pre-
pared with a hatchet to cut down a quantity, which I soon found,
for there was great plenty of them. These I set up to dry within

in making, as well as 1 could, several baskets; both to carry
earth, or to carry or lay up anything as I had occasion for.

tookv care never to be without them; and as my wicker-ware
decayed, I made more; especially strong deep baskets, to place

ROBINSON CRUSOI. 88
about it, I bestirred myself to see, if possible, how to supply
two other wants. I had no vessel to hold anything that was
liquid, except two runlets, which were almost full of rum; and
some glass bottles, some of the common size, and others (which
were case bottles) square, for the holding of waters, spirits, &c.
I had not so much as a pot to boil an thing; except a great
kettle, which I saved out of the ship, an which was too big for
such use as I desired it, viz. to make broth, and stew a bit of meat
by itself. The second thing I would fain have had, was a tobacco-~
pipe; but it was impossible for me to make one; however, I
found a contrivance for that too at last. I employed myself in
planting my second row of stakes or piles, and also in this wicker-
working all the summer or dry season; when another business took
me up more time than it could be imagined I could spare.
I mentioned before, that I had a great mind to see the whole
island; and that I had travelled up the brook, and so on to
where I had built my bower, and where I had an opening quite to
the sea, on the other side of the island. I now resolved to travel
quite across to the seashore, on that side: so taking my gun, a
hatchet, and my dog, and a larger quantity of powder and shot
than usual; with two biscuit-cakes, and a great bunch of raisins
in my pouch, for my store; I began my journey. When I had
passed the vale where my bower stood, as above, I came within
view of the sea, to the west; and it being a very clear day, I
fairly descried land, whether an island or continent I could not
tell; but it lay very high, extending from W. to W. S.W. at a
ROBINSON CRUSOI. 88
ROBINSON CRUSOI. 88
I could not tell what part of the world this might be; otherwise
than that I knew it must be part of America; and, as I concluded,
by all my observations, must be near the Spanish dominions;
and perhaps was all inhabited by savages, where, it I should
have landed, I had been in a worse condition than I was now. I
therefore acquiesced in the dispositions of Providence, which I
began now to own and to believe ordered everything for the best;

with fruitless wishes of beinor there. Besides, after some pause
upon this affair, I considered that if this land was the Spanish
coast, I should certainly, one time or other, see some vessel pass
or repass one way or other; but if not, then it was the savage
coast between the Spanish country and the Brazils, whose inhabi-
tants are indeed the worst of savages ; for they are cannibals, or
men-eaters, and fail not to murder and devour all human beings
that fall into their hands.
With these considerations, walking very leisurely forward, I
found this side of the island, where I now was, much pleasanter

of parrots; and fain would have caught one, if possible, to have
kept it to be tame, and taught it to speak to me. I did, after
taking some pains, catch a young parrot; for I knocked it down
with a stick, and, having recovered it, I brought it home; but it
was some years before I could make him speak; however, at
last I taught him to call me by my name very familiarly. But the
84 ADVENTURES or
in its place.
I was exceedingly amused with this journey. I found in the low
grounds hares, as I thought them to be, and foxes: but they
differed greatly from all the other kinds I had met with; nor
could I satisf myself to eat them, though I killed several. But
I had no nee to be ventnrous: for I had no want of food, and of
that which was very good too; especially these three sorts, viz.
goats, pigeons, and turtle, or tortoise. With these, added to my
grapes, Leadenhall-market could not have furnished a table
better than I, in proportion to the company; and though my case
was deplorable enough, yet I had great cause for thankfulness;
as I was not driven to any extremities for food, but had rather
plenty, even to dainties.
I never travelled on this journey above two miles outright in a
day, or thereabout; but I took so many turns and returns to see
what discoveries I could make, that I came weary enough to the
place where I resolved to sit down for the night; and then I either
reposed myself in a tree, or surrounded myself with a row of
stakes, set upright in the ground, either from one tree to
another, or so as no wild creature could come at me without
waking me.

As soon as I came to the sea-shore, I was surprised to see that
I had taken up my lot on the worst side of the island: for here
indeed the shore was covered with innumerable turtles; whereas,

my powder and shot; and therefore had more mind to kill a she-

that time of the day. And it happened to my farther misfortune,
that the weather proved hazy for three or four days while I was
in this valley; and not being able to see the sun, I wandered

HE RETURNS TO HIS CAVE—HIS AGRICULTURAL LABOURS AND
SUCCESS.
IN this journey, my dog surprised a young kid, and seized upon
it: and running to take hold of it, I caught it, and saved it alive
from the do". I had a great mind to bring it home if I could; for
I had often been musing whether it might not be possible to get a
kid or two, and s0 raise a breed of tame goats, which might supply
me when my powder and shot should be all spent. I made a collar
for this little creature, and with a string which I had made
of some rope-yarn, which I always carried about me, I led him
86 ADVENTURES 0t
there I enclosed him and left him ; forI was very impatient to be
at home, from whence I had been absent above a month.
I cannot express what a satisfaction it was to me to come into
my old hutch, and lie down in my hammock bed. This little
wandering journey, without a settled place of abode, had been so
unpleasant to me, that my own house, as 1 called it to myself, was
a perfect settlement to me, compared to that; and it rendered
everything about me so comfortable, that I resolved I would
never go a great way from it again, while it should be my lot to
stay on the island.
I reposed myself here a week, to rest and regale myself after
my long journey: during which, most of the time was taken up in
the weighty man of making a cage for my Poll, who began now
to be more domestic, ano to be mighty well acquainted with me.
Then I began to think of the poor kid which I had penned within
my little circle, resolved to fetch it home, or give it some food:
accordingly I went, and found it where I left it (for indeed it could
not get out,) but was almost starved for want of food. I went and

and threw it over, and having fed it, I tied it as I did before, to
lead it away; but it was so tame with being hungry, that I had no
need to have tied it, for it followed me like a dog: and as I
continually fed it, the creature became so loving, so gentle, and so
fond, that it was from that time one of my domestics also, and
would never leave me afterwards.
The rainy season of the autumnal equinox was now come, and
I kept the 30th of September in the same solemn manner as
before, being the anniversary of my landing on the island; having
now been there two ears, and no more prospect of being deli-

state, and the want of human society, by his presence, and the
communications of his grace to my soul; supporting, comforting,
and encouraging me to depend upon his providence here, and to
hope for his eternal presence hereafter.
It was now that I began sensibly to feel how much more he py
the life I now led was, with all its miserable circumstances, t an
the wicked, cursed, abominable life I led all the past part of my
days: and now I changed both my sorrows and my joys: my
very desires altered, my affections changed their gusts, and my

coming, or indeed for the two years past. Before, as I walked
about, either on my hunting, or for viewing the country, the
anguish of mv soul at my condition would break out upon me on
a sudden, and my very heart would die within me, to think of the
woods, the mountains, the deserts I was in; and how I was a
prisoner, locked up with the eternal bars and bolts of the ocean,
in an uninhabited wilderness, without redemption. In the midst
of the greatest composures of my mind, this would break out
upon me like a storm, and make me wring my hands and weep
like a child: sometimes it Would take me in the middle of my
work, and I would immediately sit down and sigh, and look upon
the ground for an hour or two together: this was still worse to
me ; but if] could burst into tears, or give vent to my feelings

But now I began to exercise myself with new thoughts; I daily
read the word of God, and applied all the comforts of it to my
present state. One morning, being very sad, I opened the Bible
upon these words, “ I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee :"
immediately it occurred that these words ’were to me; why else
should they be directed in such a manner, just at the moment
when I was mourning over my condition, as one forsaken of God
and man? Well then, said I, if God does not forsake me, of what
ill consequence can it be, or,what matters it, though the world
should forsake me; seeing, on the other hand, if I had all the
world, and should lose the favour and blessing of God, there
would be no comparison in the loss?
From this moment I began to conclude in my mind that it was
possible for me to'be more happy in this forsaken, solitary con-
dition, than it was probable I should ever have been in any other
particular state of the world; and with this thought I was going
to give thanks to God for bringing me to this place. I know not
what it was, but something shocked my mind at that thought,
and I durst not speak the words. How canst thou be such a
hypocrite, said I, even audibly, to pretend to be thankful for a
condition, which, however thou mayest endeavour to be con-
tented with, then wouldest rather pray heartily to be delivered
from? Here I stopped; but though Icould not say I thanked
God for being 7 here, yet I sincerely gave thanks to God for
RB anvns'runns or
former condition of my life, and to mourn for my wickedness, and
repent. I never opened the Bible, or shut it, but my very soul
within me blessed God for directing my friend in England, without
any order of mine, to pack it up among my goods; and for
assisting me afterwards to save it out of the wreck of the ship.
'l‘hus, and in this disposition of mind, I began my third year;
and though I have not given the reader the trouble of so par.
RB anvns'runns or
general it may be observed, that Iwas very seldom idle; but
having regularly divided my time, according to the several daily
RB anvns'runns or
God, and the reading the Scriptures, which I constantly set apart
some time for, thrice every day: secondly, Going abroad with
my gun for food, which generally took me up three hours every
morning, when it did not rain: thirdly, Ordering, curing, pre-
servmg, and cooking what i had killed or catched for my supply;
these took up great part of the day; also it is to be considered,
that in the middle of the day, when the sun was in the zenith,
the violence :f the heat was too great to stir out; so that about
four hours in the evening was all the time I could be supposed
to work in; with this exception, that sometimes I changed my
hours of bun ting and working, and went to work in the morning,
and abroad with my gun in the afternoon.
To this short time allowed for labour, I desire may be added
the exceeding laboriousness of my work; the many hours which,
for want of tools, want of help, and want of skill, everything I did
took up out of my time : for example, I was full two and forty
days making me a board for a long shelf, which I wanted in my
cave; whereas, two sawyers, with their tools and a sawpit,
would have cut six of them out of the same tree in half a day.
My case was this; it was a large tree that was to be cut down,
because my board was to be a broad one. This tree Iwas three

reducing it to a log, or piece of timber. With inexpressible
hacking and hewing, I reduced both the sides of it into chips,
till it was light enough to move; then I turned it, and made one
ROBINSON cnvsoa. 59
turning that side downward, cut the other side, till I brought the
plank to be about three inches thick, and smooth on both sides.
Any one may judge the labour of my hands in such a piece of
work; but labour and patience carried me through that, and
many other things: I only observe this in particular, to show
the reason why so much of my time went away with so little
work, viz. that what might be a little to be done with help and
tools, was a vast labour, and required a prodigious time to do
alone, and by hand. Notwithstanding this, with atience and
labour 1 went through many things; and, indee , everything
that my circumstances made necessary for me to do, as will
appear by what follows.
Iwas now in the months of November and December, expect-
ing my crop of barley and rice. The ground I had manured or
dug up for them was not great; for. as I observed, my seed of
each was not above the quantity of half a peck, having lost one
whole crop by sowing m the dry season: but now my crop
promised very well; when, on a sudden, I found Iwas in danger
of losing it all again by enemies of several sorts, which it was
ROBINSON cnvsoa. 59
creatures which I called hares, who, tasting the sweetness of the
blade, lay in it night and day, as soon as it'came up, and ate it
so close, that it could get no time to shoot up into stalk.
I saw no remed for this, but by making an enclosure about
it with a hedge, w ich I did with a great deal of toil; and the
more, because it required speed. However, as my arable land
was but small, suited to my crop, I got it tolerably well fenced
in about three weeks' time; and shooting some of the creatures
in the daytime, I set my dog to guard it in the night, tying him
up to a stake at the gate, where he would stand and bark all
night long; so in a little time the enemies forsook the place, and
the corn grew very strong and well, and began to ripen space.
But as the beasts ruined me before, while my corn was in tau
blade, so the birds were as likely to ruin me now, when it was
in the ear; for going along by the place to see how it throve, I
saw my little crop surrounded with fowls, I know not of how
many sorts, who stood, as it were, watching till I should be gone.

fowls, which I had not seen at all, from among the corn itself.
This touched me sensibly, for I foresaw that in a few days they
would devour all my hopes; that I should be starved, and never
be able to raise a crop at all; and what to do I could not tell:
however, I resolved not to lose my corn, if possible, though I

It, to see what damage was already done, and found they had
spoiled a good deal of it; but that as it was yet too green for
them, the loss was not so great, but that the remainder was
likely to be a good crop, if it could be saved.
I staid by it to load my gun, and then coming away, I could
easily see the thieves sitting upon all the trees about me, as if
they only waited till I was gone away; and the event proved it
to be so; for as I walked oil, as if gone, I was no sooner out of
their sight, than they dropped down, one by one, into the corn
again. I was so provoked, that I could not have patience to
stay till more came on, knowing that every grain they ate now
was, as it might be said, a peck loaf to me in the consequence -

This was what I wished for; so I took them up, and served them
as we serve notorious thieves in England, viz. hanged them in
chains, for a terror to others. It is impossible to imagine that
this should have such an effect as it had; for the fowls not only
never came to the corn, but, in short, they forsook all that part
of the island, and I could never see a bird near the place as long
as my scarecrows hung there. This I was very glad of, you may
be sure; and about the latter end of December, which was our
second harvest of the year, I reaped my corn.
I was sadly put to it for a scythe or sickle to cut it down: and
all I could do was to make one as well as I could, out of one of
the broad swords, or cutlasses, which I saved among the arms

for I cut nothing off but the ears, and carried it away in a great

and at the end of all my harvesting, I found that out of my ball
eck of seed I had near two bushels of rice. and above two
ushels and a half of barley; that is to say, by my guess, for '
had no measure.
However, this was great encouragement to me; and I foresaw
that, in time, it would please God to supply me with bread; and
yet here I was perplexed again; for I neither knew_how to grind,
or make meal of my corn, or indeed how to clean it and part it;
nor if made into meal, how to make bread of it; and if how to
make it, yet I knew not how to bake it: these things being added
to my desire of having a good quantity for store, and to secure
a. constant supply, I resolved not to taste any of this crop, but to
preserve it all for seed against the next season ; and, in the mean
time, to emplo all my study and hours of working to accomplish
this great war of providing myself with corn and bread.
It might be truly said, that now I worked for my bread. It is
a little wonderful, and what I believe few people have thought
much upon, viz. the strange multitude of little things necessary

ing this one article of bread. I, that was reduced to a mere
state of nature, found this to my daily discouragement, and was
made more sensible of it every hour, even afterI had got the

pectedly, and indeed to a surprise.
First, I had no plough to turn up the earth; no spade or
shovel to dig it: well, this I conquered, by making a wooden
spade, as I observed before; but this did my work in but a
wooden manner; and though it cost me a great many days to
make it, yet, for want of iron, it not only wore out the sooner,
but made my work the harder, and performed it much worse.
However, this I bore with, and was content to work it out with
patience, and bear with the badness of the performance. When
the corn was sown, I had no harrow, but was forced to go over it
myself, and drag a great heavy bough of a tree over it, to scratch
it, as it may be called, rather than rake or harrow it. When it
was growing and grown, I have observed already how many
things I wanted to fence it, secure it, mow or reap it, cure and
carry it home, thresh, part it from the chaff, and save it: then I
wanted a mill to grind it, sieves to dress it: yeast and salt to
make it into bread, and an oven to bake it; and yet all these
things I did without, as shall be observed; and the corn was an
inestimable comfort and advantage to me: all this, as I said,
made everything laborious and te ious to me, but that there was
no help for; neither was my time so much loss to me, because,
as I had divided it, a certain part of it was every day appeinted
to these works; and as I resolved to use none of the corn for
bread till I had a greater uantity by me, I had the next six
months to apply myself w olly, by labour and invention, to
furnish myself with utensils proper for the performing all thy

BUT now I was to prepare more land; for I had seed enough
to sow above an acre of ground. Before I did this, I had a week’s
work at least to make me a spade; which, when it was done,
was but a sorry one indeed, and very heavy, and required double
labour to work with it: however, I went through that, and

a good hedge; the stakes of which were all cut off that wood
which I had set before, and knew it would grow; so that, in one
year's time, I knew I should have a quick or living hedge, that
would want but little repair. This work took me up full three
months; because a great part of the time was in the wet seasonI
when I could not go abroad. Within doors, that is, when it
rained, and I could not go out, I found employment on the
following occasions; always observing, that while I was at work,
I diverted myself with talking to my parrot, and teaching him to
speak; and I quickly taught him to know his 01 a name, and at

I ever heard spoken in the island by any mouth but my own.
This, therefore, was not my work, but an assistant to my work;
for now, as I said, I had a reat employment upon my hands, as
follows: I had long studied, by some means or other, to make
myself some earthen vessels. which indeed I wanted much, bir

It would make the reader pity me, or rather laugh at me, to tell
how many awkward ways I took to raise this pastil; what odd,
misshapen, ugly things I made; how many of them fell in, and

being set out too hastily; and how many fell in pieces with only
removing, as well before as after they were dried ; and, in a word,
ROBINSON CRUSOB. 93
temper it, to bring it home, and work it, I could not make above
two large earthen ugly things (I cannot call them jars) in about
two months' labour.
However, as the sun baked these two very dry and hard, I
lifted them very gently up, and set them down again in two great :
wicker baskets, which I had made on purpose for them, that they
might not break; and as between the pot and the basket there
was a little room to spare, I smiled it full of the rice and barley
straw; and these two pots being to stand always dry, I thought
would hold my dry corn, and perhaps the meal, when the corn
was bruised.
Though I miscarried so much in my design for large pots, yet I
made several smaller things with better success; such as little

But all this would not answer my end, which was to get an

morning I had three very good, I will not say handsome, pipkins,
and two other earthen pots, as hard burnt as could be desired;
and one of them perfectly glazed with the running of the sand.
After this experiment, I need not say that I wanted no sort of
earthenware for my use: but I must needs say, as to the shapes
of them, they were very indifferent, as any one may suppose, as
I had no way of making them but as the children make dirt pies,
or as a woman would make pies that never learned to raise paste.
No joy at a thing of so mean a nature was ever equal to mine,
when I found I had made an earthen pot that would hear the.

meat, which it did admirably well; and with a piece of a kid I
made some very good broth; though I wanted oatmeal, and
several other ingredients requisite to make it so good as I would
have had it been.
My next concern was to get a stone mortar to stamp or beat
some corn in; for as to the mill, there was no thought of arriving
to that perfection of art with one pair of hands. To supply this
want I was at a great loss; for, of all trades in the world, I was

I did not see it possible I could have any bread. This was a

stuff, to search the meal through. Here I was at a full stop for
many months; nor did I really know what to do: linen I had
none left, but what was mere rags ; I had goats’ hair, but neithe:
knew how to weave it nor spin it; and had I known how, here
were no tools to work it with: all the remedy I found for this
was, at last recollecting I had, among the seamen's clothes which
Were saved out of the ship, some neckcloths of calico or muslin,
with some pieces of these I made three small sieves, proper
enough for the work; and thus I made shift for some years:
how I did afterwards, I shall show in its place.
The baking part was the next thing to be considered, and how

yeast: as to that part, there was no supplying the want, so I did
not concern myself much about it; but for an oven I was indeed
puzzled. At length I found out an expedient for that also, which
was this; I made some earthen vessels, very broad, but not
deep, that is to say, about two feet diameter, and not above nine
nosmsos causon. 95
and laid them by; and when I wanted to bake, I made a great
nosmsos causon. 95
of my own making and burning also; but I should not call them
nosmsos causon. 95
coals, I drew them forward upon the hearth, so as to cover it all
over, and there let them lie till the hearth was very hot; then
sweeping away all the embers, I set down my loaf, or loaves,
and covering them with the earthen pot, drew the embers all
round the outside of the pot,‘ to keep in and add to the heat; and
thus, as well as in the best oven in the world, I baked my barley
loaves, and became, in a little time, a good pastrycook into the
bargain; for I made myself several cakes and puddings of the
rice; but made no pies, as I had nothing to put into them except
nosmsos causon. 95
It need not be wondered at, if all these things took me up
most part of the third year of my abode here; for, it is to be
observed, in the intervals of these things, I had my new harvest
and husbandry to manage: I reaped my corn in its season, and
carried it home as well as I could, and laid it up in the ear, in
nosmsos causon. 95
to thresh it on, or instrument to thresh it with.
And now, indeed, my stock of corn increasing, I really wanted
to build my barns bigger: I wanted a place to lay it up in; for
the increase of the corn now yielded me so much, that I had of
the barley about twenty bushels, and of rice as much, or more,
insomuch that now I resolved to begin to use it freely; for my
bread had been quite gone a great while: I resolved also to see
nosmsos causon. 95
sow but once a year.
Upon the whole, I found that the forty bushels of barley and
rice were much more than I could consume in a year; so I
resolved to sow just the same quantity eve year that I sowed
the last, in hopes that such a quantity wo d fully provide me
with bread, &c.

ALL the while these things were doing, you ma be sure my
thoughts ran many times upon the prospect of Ian which I had
seen from the other side of the island; and I was not without
some secret wishes that I was on shore there; fancying, that

some way or other to convey myself farther, and perhaps at last
96 ADVENTURES or
But all this while I made no allowance for the dangers of such
I condition, and that I might fall into the hands of savages, and
perhaps such as I might have reason to think far worse than the
lions and tigers of Africa; that if I once came in their power, I
should run a hazard of more than a thousand to one of being
killed, and perhaps of being eaten; forI had heard that the
people of the Carribean coast were cannibals, or man-eaters;
and I knew, by the latitude, that I could not be far off from that
shore. Then supposing they were not cannibals, yet that they
might kill me, as they had many Europeans who had fallen into
their hands, even when they have been ten or twenty together;
much more I, who was but one, and could make little or no
defence; all these things, I say, which I ought to have con-
sidered well of, and did cast up in my thoughts afterwards, took
96 ADVENTURES or
upon the thought of getting over to the shore.
Now I wished for my boy Xury, and the long-boat with the
shoulder-of-mutton sail, With which I sailed above a thousand
miles on the coast of Africa: but this was in vain: then I thought
I would go and look at our ship's boat, which, as I have said,
was blown up upon the shore a great way, in the storm, when we

almost bottom upward, agairst a high ridge of beachy rough
sand; but no water about her, as before. If I had had hands to

boat would have done very well, and I might have gone back
into the Brazils with her easily enough ; but I might have fore-
seen that I could no more turn her and set her upright upon her
bottom, than I could remove the island: however, I went to the
woods, and cut levers and rollers, and brought them to the boat,
resolving to try what I could do ; suggesting to myself, that if]
could but turn her down, and repair the damage she had received,
she would be a very good boat, and I. might venture to sea in her.
I spared no pains, indeed, in this piece of fruitless toil, and
ROBINSON CRUSOE. 97
impossible to heave her up with my little strength, I fell to dig-
ging away the sand, to undermine her, and so as to makeher
fall down, setting pieces of wood to thrust and guide her right
in the fall. But when I had done this, I was unable to stir her
up again, or to get under her, much less to move her forward
towards the water; so I was forced to give it over: and yet,
though I gave over the hopes of the boat, my desire to venture
over the main increased, rather than diminished, as the means
for it seemed impossible. -
At length, I began to think whether it was not possible to
make myself a canoe, or periagua, such as the natives of those
climates make, even without tools, or, as Imight say, without
hands, of the trunk of a great tree. This I not only thought
possible, but eas , and pleased myself extremely with the idea
of making it, an with my having much more convenience for it
than any of the Negroes or Indians; but not at all considering
the particular inconveniences which I lay under more than the
Indians did, viz. the want of hands to move it into the water
ROBINSON CRUSOE. 97
than all the consequences of want of tools could be to them: for
what could it avail me, if, after I had chosen my tree, and with
much trouble cut it down, and might be able with my tools to
hew and dub the outside into the proper shape of a boat, and
burn or cut out the inside to make it hollow, so as to make a
boat of it—if, after all this, I must leave it just where I found
it, and was not able to launch it into the water?

mind of my circumstances while _I was making this boat, I
should have immediately thought how I was to get it into the
sea: but my thoughts were so intent upon my voyage in it, that
I never once considered how I should get it off the land; and it
was really, in its own nature, more easy for me to guide it over

and I question much whether Solomon ever had such a one for

eleven inches diameter at the end of twenty-two feet, where it
lessened and then parted into branches. It was not without in-

it cost me a month to shape it and dub it to a proportion, and
to something like the bottom of a boat, that it might swim up—
right as it ought to do. It cost me near three months more to
clear the inside, and work it out so as to make an exact boat of

and by the dint of hard labour, till I had brought it to be a very
handsome periagua, and big enough to have carried six-and-
twenty men, and consequently big enough to have carried me
and all my cargo.
When I had gone through this work, I was extremely delighted
with it. The boat was really much bigger than ever I saw a
canoe or a periagua that was made of one tree, in my life. Many
a weary stroke it had cost, you may be sure; and there remained
nothing but to get it into the water; which, had I accomplished,
I make no question but I should have begun the maddest voyage,
and the most unlikely to be performed, that ever was undertaken.
But all my devices to get it into the water failed me; though
they cost me inexpressible labour too. It lay about one hundred

discouragement, I resolved to dig into the surface of the earth,

deliverance in view?) when this was worked through, and this

more stir the canoe than I could the other boat. Then I measured
the distance of ground, and resolved to cut a dock, or canal, to
bring the water up to the canoe, seeing I could not bring the
canoe down to the water. Well, I began this work; and when
I began to enter upon it, and calculate how deep it was to be
dug, how broad, how the stuff was to be thrown out, I found by
the number of hands I had, having none but my own, that it
must have been ten or twelve years before I could have gone
through with it; for the shore lay so high, that at the upper
end it must have been at least twenty feet deep; this attempt,
though with great reluctancy, I was at length obliged to give
over also.
This grieved me heartily; and now I saw, though too late, the
folly of beginning a work before we count the cost, and before
we judge rightly of our own strength to go through with it.

with as much comfort as before; for, by a constant study and
serious application to the word of God, and by the assistance of
his grace, I gained a different knowledge from what I had before;
I entertained different notions of things; I looked now upon the
world as a. thing remote, which I had nothing to do with, no ex-
pectation from, and, indeed, no desires about: in a word, I had
nothing to do with it, nor was ever likely to have; I thought it
looked, as we may perhaps look upon it hereafter, viz. as a place I
had lived in, but was come out of it; and well might I say, as father

nor the pride of life. I had nothing to covet, for I had all that
I was now capable of enjoying: I was lord of the whole manor;
or, if I pleased, I might call myself king or emperor over the
whole country which I had possession of; there were no rivals; I
had no competitor, none to dispute sovereignty or command
with me: I might have raised ship-loadings of corn, but I had
no use for it; so I let as little grow as I thought enough for my
occasion. I had tortoise or turtle enough, but now and then
one was as much as I could put to an use; I had timber enough

spoiled; the trees that I cut down were lying to rot on the
ground; I could make no more use of them than for fuel, and
that I had no other occasion for but to dress my food.
In a word, the nature and experience of things dictated to

are of no farther good to us than for our use; and that whatever
we may heap up to give others, we enjoy only as much as we

parcel of money, as well gold as silver, about thirty-six pounds
sterling. Alas! there the nasty, sorry, useless stuff lay: I had
no manner of business for it; and I often thought within myself,
that I would have given a handful of it for a gross of tobacco-
pipes, or for a hand-mill to grind my corn; nay, I would have
given it all for sixpenny worth of turnip and carrot seed from
England, or for a handful of peas and beans, and a bottle of ink.

the cave in the wet seasons; and if I had had the drawer full of

I had now brought my state of life to be much more com-

as well as to in body. I frequently sat down to meat with
thankfulness, an admired the hand of God's providence, which
had thus spread my tablein the wilderness: I learned to look
more upon the bright side of my condition, and less upon the
dark side, and to consider what I enjoyed, rather than what I
wanted: and this gave me sometimes such secret comforts, that
I cannot express them; and which I take notice of here, to put
those discontented people in mind of it, who cannot enjoy com-
fortably what God has given them, because they see and covet
something that he has not given them. All our discontents
about what we want appeared to me to spring from the want of
thankfulness for what we have.

mind with hopes ; and this was, comparing my present condition
with what I had deserved, and had therefore reason to expect
from the hand of Providence. I had lived a dreadful life, per-
fectly destitute of the knowledge and fear of God. I had been
well instructed by my father and mother; neither had they been
wanting to me, in their endeavours to infuse an early religious
awe of God into my mind, a sense of my duty, and what the
nature and end of my being required of me. But, alas ! falling
early into the seafaring life, which, of all lives, is the most desti-
tute of the fear of God, though his terrors are always before
them; I say, falling early into the seafaring life, and into sea-
faring company, all that little sense of religion which I had enter-
tained was laughed out of me by my messmates; by a hardened
despising of dangers, and the views of death, which grew habitual
to me; by my long absence from all manner of opportunities to
converse with anything but what was like myself, or to hear
anything that was good, or tending towards it.
\/ So void was I of everything that was good, or of the least
sense of what I was, or was to be, that in the greatest deliver-
ancesl enjoyed (such as my escape from Salee, my being taken
up by the Portuguese master of a ship, my being planted so well
.n the Brazils, my receiving the cargo from England, and the
like) I never had once the words, Thank God, so much as on my
mind, or in my mouth; nor in the greatest distress had I so
much as a thought to pray to him, or so much as to say, Lord,
have mercy upon me! no, nor to mention the name of God,
unless it was to swear by, and blaspheme it.

resignation to the will of God in the present disposition of my
circumstances, but even to a sincere thankfulness for my con-
dition ; and that I, who was et a living man, ought not to com-
plain, seeing I had not the us punishment of my sins; that I
enjoyed so many mercies which I had no reason to have expected
in that place, that I ought never more to repine at my condition,
but to rejoice, and to give daily thanks for that daily bread, which
nothing but a crowd of wonders could have brought; that I
ought to consider I had been fed by a miracle, even as great as
that of feeding Elijah by ravens ; nay, by a long series of miracles:
and that I could hardly have named a place in the uninhabitable
part of the world whereI could have been cast more to my
advantage; a place where, as I had no society, which was my

wolves or tigers, to threaten my'life; no venomous or poisonous
creatures, which I might feed on to my hurt; no savages, to
murder and devour me. In a word, as my life was a life of
sorrow one way, so it was a life of mercy another; and I wanted
nothing to make it a life of comfort, but to make myself sensible
of God's goodness to me, and care over me in this condition;
and after I did make a just improvement of these things, I went
away, and was no more sad.
I had now been here so long, that many things which I brought
on shore for my help were either quite gone, or very much
wasted, and near spent.
My ink, as I observed, had been gone for some time, all but a
very little, which I eked out with water, a little and a little, till
it was so pale, it scarce left any appearance of black upon the
paper. As long as it lasted, I made use of it to minute down the
days of the month on which any remarkable thing happened to
102 ADVENTURES or
was a strange concurrence of days in the various providences
which befell me, and which, if I had been superstitiously inclined
to observe days as fatal or fortunate, I might have had reason to
have looked upon with a great deal of curiosity.
First, I had observed, that the same day that I broke away
from my father and my friends, and ran away to Hull, in order
to go to sea, the same day afterwards I was taken by the Sallee
man-of-war, and made a slave ; the same day of the year that I
escaped out of the wreck of the ship in Yarmouth Roads, that
same day, years afterwards, I made my escape from Sallee in the
boat : and the same day of the year I was born on, viz. the 30th
of September. that same day I had my life so miraculously saved
twenty-six years after, when I was cast on shore in this island:
so that my wicked life and my solitary life began both on one day.
The next thing to my ink being wasted, was that of my bread,
I mean the biscuit which I brought out of the ship: this I had
husbanded to the last degree, allowing myself but one cake of
bread a day for above a year; and yet I was quite without bread
for near a year before I got any corn of my own; and great
reason I had to be thankful that I had any at all, the getting it
being, as has been already observed, next to miraculous.
My clothes, too, began to decay mightily: as to linen, I had
none for a great while, except some chequered shirts which I
found in the chests of the other seamen, and which I carefully
preserved, because many times [could bear no clothes on but a
shirt, and it was a very great help to me that I had, amon all
the men's clothes of the ship, almost three dozen of shirts. T ere
were also, indeed, several thick watchcoats of the seamen’s which
were left, but they were too hot to wear: and though it is true
that the weather was so violently hot that there was no need of
clothes, yet I could not go quite naked, no, though I had been
inclined to it, which I was not, nor could I abide the thought of
it, though I was all alone. The reason whyI could not go quite
naked was, I could not bear the heat of the sun so well when
quite naked as with some clothes on; nay, the very heat fre-
quently blistered my skin: whereas, with a shirt on, the air
itself made some motion, and whistling under the shirt, was two-
fold cooler than without it. No more could I ever bring myself
to go out in the heat of the sun without a cap or hat; the heat
of the sun beating with such violence as it does in that place,
would give me the headach presently, by darting so directly upon
in head, without a. cap or hat on, so t at I could not bear it;
w ereas, if I put on my hat, it would presently go away.
Upon these views, I began to consider about putting the few
rags I had, which I called clothes, into some order. I had worn
out all the waistcoats I had, and my business was now to try if
I could not make jackets out of the great watchcoats that I had
by me, and with such other materials as I had ; so] set to work
a tailoring, or rather, indeed, abotching, for I made most piteous
work of it. However, I made shift to make two or three new
waistcoats, which I hoped would serve me a great while : as for
breeches, or drawers, 1 made but a very sorry shift indeed, till
afterwards.
I have mentioned that I saved the skins of all the creatures
that I killed, I mean four-footed ones; and I had hung them up,
stretched out with sticks, in the sun, by which means some of

ram; and this I performed so well, that after this I made me I

suit of clothes wholly of the skins, that is to say, a waistcoat
and breaches, open at the knees, and both loose; for they were
rather wanting to keep me cool than warm. I must not omit to
acknowledge that they were wretchedly made; for if I was a bat"
carpenter, I was a worse tailor. However, they were such as I
made very good shift with; and when I was abroad, if it hap
pened to rain, the hair of my waistcoat and cap being uppermost.
I was kept very dry.
After this, I spent a great deal of time and pains to make me
an umbrella: I was indeed in great want of one, and had a great
mind to make one : I had seen them made in the Brazils, where
they were very useful in the great heats which are there; and I
felt the heats every jot as great here, and greater too, being
nearer the equinox : besides, as l was obliged to be much
abroad, it was a most useful thing to me, as well for the rains as
the heats. I took a world of pains at it, and was a great while
before I could make anything likely to hold; nay, after I thought
I had hit the way, I spoiled two or three before I made one to

with greater advantage than I could bef re in the coolest; and
when I had no need of it, could close it an carry it under my arm.
Thus I lived mighty comfortably, my mind being entirely com-
posed by resigning to the will of God, and throwing myself
wholly upon the disposal of his providence. This made my life
better than sociable; for when I began to regret the want of
conversation, I would ask mlyself, whether thus conversing
mutually with my own thoug ts, and, as I hope I may say,
with even God himself, by ejaculations, was not better than the
utmost enjoyment of human society in the worldt

over the land, so the discoveries I made in that little journey
made me very eager to see other parts of the coast; and now I
had a boat, I thought of nothing but sailing round the island.
For this purpose, that I might do everything with di--- etion

a sail to it out of some of the pieces of the ship’s sails which lay

my mast and sail, and tried the boat, I found she would sail very
well: then I made little lockers, or boxes, at each end of my
boat, to put provisions, necessaries, ammunition, 8:0. into, to be
kept dry, either from rain or the spray of the sea; and a little
.ong hollow place I cut in the inside of the boat, where I could
106 , anmmnas or
106 , anmmnas or
stand over my head, and keep the heat of the sun off me, like an
awning; and thus every now and then took a little voyage upon
the sea, but never went far out, nor far from the little creek.
At last, being eager to view the circumference of my little king-
dom, I resolved upon my cruise; and accordingly, I victualled
my ship for the voyage, putting in two dozen of loaves (cakes I
should rather call them) of barley bread, an earthen pot full of
arched rice (a food I ate a great deal of,) a little bottle of rum,
half a goat, and powder and shot for killing more, and two large
watchcoats, of those which, as I mentioned before. I had saved
out of the seamen’s chests; these I took, one to lie upon, and
the other to cover me in the night.
It was the sixth of November, in the sixth year of my reign,
or my captivity, which you please, that I set out on this voyage,
and I found it much longer than I expected; for though the
island itself was not very large, yet when I came to the east side
of it, I found a great ledge of rocks lie out about two leagues
into the sea, some above water, some under it; and beyond that
a shoal of sand, lying dry half a league more, so that I was
obliged to go a great way out to sea to double the point.

oblige me to go out to sea, and, above all, doubting how I
should get back again; so I came to an anchor; for I had made
me a kind of anchor with a piece of a broken grappling which I
got out of the sin .
Having secured, my boat, I took my gun and went on shore,
climbing up on a hill, which seemed to overlook that point,
where I saw the full extent of it, and resolved to venture.
‘In my viewing the sea from that hill where I stood, I per-
ceived a strong, and indeed a most furious current, which ran
to the east, and even came close to the point; and I took the
more notice of it, because I saw there might be some danger
that, when I came into it, I might be carried out to sea by the
strength of it, and not be able to make the island again: and,

been so; for there was the same current on the other side the
island, only that it set off at a farther distance, and Lsaw there
was a strong eddy under the shore : so I had nothing to do but
aoamsom causes. 107
e dv.
I lay here, however, two days, because the wind blowing
pretty fresh at E. S. E., and that being just contrary to the said
current, made a great breach of the sea upon the point; so that
it was not safe for me to keep too close to the shore, for the
breach, nor to go too far off, because of the stream.
The third day, in the morning, the wind having abated over-
night, the sea was calm, and I ventured; but I am a warning—
piece again to all rash and ignorant pilots : for no sooner was I
come to the point, when I was not even my boat’s length from
the shore, but I found myself in a great depth of water, and a
current like the sluice of a mill; it carried my boat along with it
with such violence, that all I could do could not keep her so
much as on the edge of it; but I found it hurried me farther and
farther out from the eddy, which was on my left hand. There
was no wind stirring to help me, and all I could do with my
aoamsom causes. 107
for lost; for as the current was on both sides of the island, I
knew in a few leagues’ distance they must join again, and then
I was irrecoverably gone; nor did I see any possibility of
avoiding it; so that I had no prospect before me but of perish-
ing, not by the sea, for that was calm enough, but of starving for
hunger. I had indeed found a tortoise on the shore, as big
almost as I could lift, and had tossed it into the boat; and I had
a great jar of fresh water, that is to say, one of my earthen pots;
but what was all this to being driven into the vast ocean, where,
to be sure, there was no shore, no main land or island, for a
thousand leagues at least?
And now I saw how easy it was for the providence of God to
make even the most miserable condition of mankind worse. Now
I looked back upon my desolate, solitary island as the most
pleasant place in the world; and all the happiness my heart
could wish for was to be but there again. I stretched out my
hands to it, with eager wishes : 0 happy desert! said I, I shall
never see thee more. 0 miserable creature ! whither am I
going! Then I reproached myself with my unthankful temper,
and how I had repined at my solitary condition; and now what
would I give to be on shore there again! Thus we never see the
true state of our condition till it is illustrated to us by its con~
I
traries, nor know how to value what we enjoy, but by the want
of it. It is scarce possible to imagine the consternation I was
now in, being driven from my beloved island (for so it appeared
to me now to be) into the wide ocean, almost two leagues, and
in the utmost despair of ever recovering it again. However, I
worked hard, till indeed my strength was almost exhausted, and
he t my boat as much to the northward, that is, towards the
si e of the current which the eddy lay on, as possibly I could;
when about noon, as the sun passed the meridian, I thought I
felt a little breeze of wind in my face, springing up from S.S.E,
This cheered my heart a, little, and especially when, in about
half an hour more, it blew a. pretty gentle gale. By this time I
was got at a frightful distance from the island, and had the least
cloudy or hazy weather intervened, I had been undone another
way too ; for I had no compass on board, and should never have
known how to have steered towards the island, if I had but
once lost sight of it; but the weather continuing clear, I applied
myself to get up my mast again, and spread my sail, standing
away to the north as much as possible, to get out of the current.
Just as I had set my mast and sail, and the boat began to
stretch away, I saw even by the clearness of the water some
alteration of the current was near; for where the current was
so strong, the water was foul; but perceiving the water clear,
I found the current abate; and presently I found to the east, at
about half a. mile, a breach of the sea upon some rocks: these
rocks I found caused the current to part again, and as the main
stress of it ran away more southerly, leaving the rocks to the
north-east, so the other returned by the repulse of the rocks,
and made a strong eddy, which ran back again to the north-west,
with a very sharp stream.
They who know what it is to have a reprieve brought to them
upon the ladder, or to be rescued from thieves just going to
murder them, or who have been in such-like extremities, may
guess what my present surprise of joy was, and how gladly I put
my boat into the stream of this eddy; and the wind also fresh-
l08 aovanruaas or
before the wind, and with a strong tide or eddy under foot.
This eddy carried me about a league in my way back again,
directly towards the island, but about two leagues more to the
l08 aovanruaas or
that when I came near the island, I found myself open to the
northern shore of it, that is to say, the other end of the island,
opposite to that which I went out from.
When I had made something more than a league of way by
the help of this current or eddy, 'I found it was spent, and served
me no farther. However, I found that being between two great
currents, viz. that on the south side, which had hurried me away,
end that on the north, which lay about a league on the other
side; I say, between these two, in the make of the island, I
found the water at least still, and running no way; and having
still a breeze of wind fair for me, I kept on steering directly for
the island, though not making such fresh way as I did before.
About four o’clock in the evening, being then within a league
of the island, I found the point of the rocks which occasioned
this disaster stretching out, as is described before, to the south
ward, and casting off the current more southerly, had, of course,
made another eddy to the north; and this I found very strong,
but not directly setting the way my course lay, which was due
west, but almost full north. However, having a fresh gale I
stretched across this eddy, slanting north-west; and, in about an
hour, came within about a mile of the shore, where, it being
smooth water, I soon got to land.
When I was on shore, I fell on my knees, and gave God
thanks for my deliverance, resolving to lay aside all thoughts of
my deliverance by my boat; and refreshing myself with such
things as I had, I brought my boat close to the shore, in a little
cove that I had spied under some trees, and laid me down to
sleep, being quite spent with the labour and fatigue of the voyage.
I was now at a great loss which way to get home with my
boat: I had run so much hazard, and knew too much of the case,
to think of attempting it by the way I went out; and what might
be at the other side (I mean the west side) I knew not, nor had
I any mind to run any more ventures; so I only resolved in the
morning to make my way westward along the shore, and see if
there was no creek where I might lay up my frigate in safety, so
as to have her again, if I wanted her. In about three miles, or
thereabout, coasting the shore, I came to a very good inlet or
bay, about a mile over, which narrowed till it came to a very
little rivulet or brook, where I found a very convenient harbour
for my boat, and where she lay as if she had been in a little dock
made on purpose for her. Here I put in, and having stowed
my boat very safe, I went on shore, to look about me, and see
where I was.
I soon found I had but a little passed by the place where I had
been before, when I travelled on foot to that shore; s0 taking
nothing out of my boat but my gun and umbrella, for it was
exceeding hot, I began my march. The way was comfortable
enough after such a voyage as I had been upon, and I reached
my old bower in the evening, where I found everything standing
as I had left it; for I always kept it in good order, being, as I
said before, my country house.
I got over the fence, and laid me down in the shade to res;
my limbs, for I was very weary, and fell asleep: but judge you,
if you can, that read my story, what a surprise I must be in,
111811 I was awaked out of my sleep by a voice, calling me by
my name several times, Robin, Robin, Robin Crusoe; poor Robin

ing the latter part, that I did not wake thoroughly; but dozing
between sleeping and waking, thought I dreamed that somebody
spoke to me; but as the voice continued to repeat Robin Crusoe,
Robin Crusoe, at last I began to wake more perfectly, and was
110 ADVENTURES or
sternation; but no sooner were my eyes open, but I saw my
Poll sitting on the top of the hedge; and immediately knew it
was he that spoke to me: for just in such bemoaning language
I had used to talk to him, and teach him; and he had learned it
110 ADVENTURES or
close to my face, and cry, Poor Robin Crusoe; Where are you?
Where have you been? How came you here? and such things
as I had taught him.
However, even though I knew it was the parrot, and that
indeed it could be nobody else, it was a good while before I could
compose myself. First, I was amazed how the creature got
thither; and then how he should just keep about the place, and
110 ADVENTURES or
honest Poll, I got over it; and holding out my hand, and call-
ing him by his name, Poll, the sociable creature came to me,
and sat upon my thumb, as he uSed to do, and continued talking
to me, Poor Robin Crusoe! and how did I come here? and where
had I been? just as if he had been overjoyed to see me again:
and so I carried him home along with me.
I now had enough of rambling to sea for some time, and had
110 ADVENTURES or
danger I had been in. I would have been very glad to have had
my boat again on my side of the island; but I knew not how
it was practicable to get it about. As to the east side of the
island, which I had gone round, I knew well enough there was
no venturing that way; my very heart would shrink, and my
very blood run chill, but to think of it; and as to the other side
of the island, I did not know how it might be there; but sup-
posing the current ran with the same force against the shore at
the east as it passed by it on the other, I might run the same
risk of being driven down the stream, and carried by the island,
as I had been before of being carried away from it; so, with
these thoughts, I contented myself to be without any boat,
though it had been the product of so many months’ labour to
make it, and of so many more to get it into the sea.
In this government of my temper lremained near a year,
lived a very sedate, retired life, as you may well suppose; and
my thoughts being very much composed, as to my condition,
and fully comforted in resigning myself to the dispositions of
Providence, I thought I lived really very happily in all things,
exeept that of societ . .
I improved myseldin this time in all the mechanic exercises
which my necessities put me upon applying myself to; and]
believe I could, upon occasion, have made every good carpenter,
especially considering how few tools I had.
Besides this, I arrived at an unexpected perfection in my
earthenware, and contrived well enough to make them with a

been always used to smoke: and there were pipes in the ship,

in the island; and afterwards, when I searched the ship again,
I could not come at any pipes at all.
In my wickerware also I improved much, and made abundance
of necessary baskets, as well as my invention showed me; though
not very handsome, yet they were such as were very handy and
convenient for my laying things up in, or fetching things home.
For example, if I killed a goat abroad, I could hang it up in a

and bring them home in a basket, and leave the rest behind me.
Also large deep baskets were the receivers of my corn, which I
always rubbed out as soon as it was dry, and cured, and kept it
in great baskets.
I began now to perceive my powder abated considerably; this
was a want which it was impossible for me to supply, and I
began seriously to consider what I must do when I should have
no more powder, that is to say, how I should do to kill any
goats. I had, as is observed, in the third year of my being here,
kept a young kid, and bred her up tame, and I was in hopes of
getting a he-goat: but I could not by any means bring it to pass,

SECTION XVI.
HE REARS A FLOCK OF GOATS.—HIS DAIRY.-—HIS DOMESTIC HABITS
AND STYLE OF LIVING—INCREASING PROSPERITY.
BEING now in the eleventh year of my residence, and as l have
said, my ammunition growing low, I set myself to study some art
to trap and snare the goats, to see whether I could not catch
some of them alive; and particularly, I wanted a she-goat great
with young. For this purpose, I made snares to hamper them;
and I do believe they were more than once taken in them: but
my tackle was not good, for I had no wire, and I always found
them broken, and my bait devoured. At length I resolved to '
try a pitfall: so I dug several large pits in the earth, in places
where I had observed the goats used to feed, and over those pits
I placed hurdles, of my own making too, with a great weight
upon them; and several times I put ears of barley and dry rice,
without setting the trap; and I could easily perceive that the
goats had gone in and eaten up the corn, for I could see the
marks of their feet. At length I set three traps in one night,
and going the next morning, I found them all standing, and yet
the bait eaten and gone. This was very discouraging: however.
I altered my traps; and, not to trouble you with particulars,
going one morning to see my traps, I found in one of them a
large old he-goat, and in one of the others three kids, a male
and two females.
As to the old one, I knew not what to do with him; he was
112 ADVENTURES or
go about to bring him away alive, which was what I wanted. I
could have killed him, but that was not my business, nor would
it answer my end; so I even let him out, and he ran away, as if
he had been frightened out of his wits. But I had forgot then,
what I had learned afterwards, that hunger will tame a lion. If
Ihad let him sta there three or four days without food, and
then have carrie him some water to drink, and then a little
corn, he would have been as tame as one of the kids; for they
are mighty sagacious, tractable creatures, where they are well
used. However, for the present I let him go, knowing no better
at that time: then I went to the three kids, and taking them one

brought them all home.
It was a good while before they would feed; but throwing
them some sweet corn, it tempted them, and they began to be
tame. And now I found that if I expected to supply myself with

me, that I must keep the tame from the wild, or else they would
always run wild when they grew up; and the only way for this
was, to have some enclosed piece of ground, well fenced, either
with hedge or pale, to keep them in so effectually, that those
within might not break out, or those without break in.
This was a great undertaking for one pair of hands; yet as I

to be herbage for them to eat, water for them to drink, and cover
to keep them from the sun.
Those who understand such inclosures will think I had very
little contrivance, when I pitched upon a place very proper for
all these (being a plain open piece of meadow land, or savannah,
as our people call it in the western colonies) which had two or
three little drills of fresh water in it, and at one end was very
woody; I say, they will smile at my forecast, when I shall tell
them, I began my enclosing this piece of ground in such a man-
ner, that my hedge or pale must have been at least two miles
about. Nor was the madness of it so great as to the compass,
for if it was ten miles about, I was like to have time enough to
do it in; but I did not consider that my goats would he as wild
in so much compass as if they had had the whole island, and I
should have so much room to chase them in, that I should never
catch them.

should have in any reasonable time, so, as my stock increased,
I could add more ground to my enclosure.
This was acting with some prudence, and I went to work with

and, till I had done it, I tethered the three kids in the best part
of it, and used them to feed as near me as possible, to make them
familiar; and very often I would go and carry them some cars

on when I pleased, but milk too; a thing which, indeed, in the
beginning, I did not so much as think of, and which, when it
came into my thoughts, was really an agreeable surprise; for now
I set up my dairy, and had sometimes a gallon or two of milk in
a day. And as Nature, who gives supplies of food to every
creature, dictates even naturally how to make use of it, so I, that
had never milked a cow, much less a goat, or seen butter or
cheese made, only when I was a boy, after a great many essays
and miscarriages, made me both butter and cheese at last, and
also salt (though I found it partly made to my hand by the heat
of the sun upon some of the rocks of the sea), and never wanted
it afterwards. How mercifully can our Creator treat his creatures,
even in those conditions in which they seemed to be overwhelmed
in destruction! How can he sweeten the bitterest providences,
and give us cause to praise him for dungeons and prisons! What
a table was here spread for me in a wilderness, where I saw

It would have made a stoic smile to have seen me and my
little family sit down to dinner. There was my majesty, the
prince and lord of the whole island; I had the lives of all my
subjects at my absolute command; 1 could hang, draw, give
liberty, and take it away; and no rebels among all my subjects.
Then to see how like a king I dined too, all alone, attended by
my servants: Poll, as if he had been my favourite, was the only
person permitted to talk to me. My dog, who was now grown
very old and crazy, and had found no species to multiply his kind
upon, sat always at my right hand; and two cats, one on one
side of the table, and one on the other, expecting now and then
a bit from my hand, as a mark of special favour.
But these were not the two cats which I brought on shore at
mnmson causes. 115
my habitation by my own hand; but one of them having multi-
plied by I know not what kind of creature, these were two which
I had preserved tame; whereas the rest ran wild in the woods,
and became indeed troublesome to me at last; for they would
often come into my house, and plunder me too, till at last I was
obliged to shoot them, and did kill a great many; at length they
left me.-—-With this attendance, and in this plentiful manner, I
lived: neither could I be said to want anything but society; and
of that, some time after this, I was like to have too much.
I was something impatient, as I have observed, to have the use
of my boat, though very loath to run any more hazards; and
therefore sometimes I sat contriving ways to get her about the
island, and at other times I sat myself down contented enough
without her. But I had a strange uneasiness in my mind to go
down to the point of the island, where, as I have said, in my last
ramble, I went up the hill to see how the shore lay, and how the
current set, that I might see what I had to do: this inclination
increased upon me every day, and at length I resolved to travel
thither by land, following the edge of the shore. I did so; but
had any one in England been to meet such a man as I was, it
must either have frightened him, or raised a great deal of
lau hter; and as I frequently stood still to look at myself, I
co d not but smile at the notion of my travelling through York-
shire, with such an equipage, and in such a dress. Be pleased

I had a short jacket of goat's skin, the skirts coming down to
about the middle of the thighs, and a air of open-kneed breeches
of the same; the breeches were ma e of the skin of an old he-
oat, whose hair hung down such a length on either side, that,

and shoes I had none, but had made me a pair of somethings, I

and lace on either side like spatterdashes, but of a most bar-

I had on a broad belt of goat's skin dried, which I drew
together with two thongs of the same, instead of buckles; and
in a kind of a frog on either side of this, instead of a sword and
dagger, hung alittle saw and a hatchet; one on one side, and one
on the other. I had another belt, not so broad, and fastened in
the same manner, which hung over my shoulder; and at the
end of it, under my left arm, hung two pouches, both made of
goats skin too: in one of which hung my powder, in the other
116 swam-mu or
my shot. At my back I carried my basket, and on my shoulder
my gun; and over my head a great clumsy ugly goat’s skin
umbrella, but which, after all, was the most necessary thing I
had about me, next to my gun. As for my face, the colour of it
was really not so mulatto-like as one might expect from a man
not at all careful of it, and living within nine or ten degrees of
the equinox. My heard I had once suffered to grow till it was
about a quarter of a yard long; but as I had both scissars and

to hang my hat upon them, but they were of a length and shape
monstrous enough, and such as, in England, would have passed

an anchor, to get upon the rocks; and having no boat now to
take care of, I went over the land, a nearer way, to the same
height that I was upon before; when looking forward to the
point of the rocks which lay out, and which I was obliged to
double with my boat, as is said above, I was surprised to see the
sea all smooth and quiet; no n'ppling, no motion, no current,
any more than in any other places. I was at a strange loss to
understand this, and resolved to spend some time in the observing
it, to see if nothing from the sets of the tide had occasioned it;
but I was presently convinced how it was, viz. that the tide of
ebb, setting from the west, and joining with the current of waters
from some great river on the shore: must be the occasion of this
current; and that according as the wind blew more forcibly from
the west, or from the north, this current came nearer, or went
farther from the shore: for waiting thereabouts till evening, I
went up to the rock again, and then the tide of ebb being made, I
plainly saw the current again as before, only that it ran farther
011‘, being near half a league from the shore; whereas, in my case,
it set close upon the shore, and hurried me and my canoe along
with it, which, at another time, it would not have done.
This observation convinced me, that I had nothing to do but
116 swam-mu or
very easily bring my boat about the island again: but when I
began to think of putting it in practice, I had such a terror upon
my spirits at the remembrance of the danger I had been in, that
I could not think of it again with any patience; but, on the con-
trary, I took up another resolution, which was more safe, though
more laborious; and this was, that I would build, or rather make
me another periagua or canoe; and so have one for one side of
the island, and one for the other.
You are to understand, that now I had, as I may call it, two

by this time, I had enlarged into several apartments or caves,

As for my wall, made; as before, with long stakes or piles,
those piles grew all like trees, and were by this time grown so
big, and spread so very much, that there was not the least ap-
pearance, to any one’s view, of any habitation behind them.
Near this dwelling of mine, but a little farther within the land,
and upon lower ground, lay my two pieces of corn land, which
I kept duly cultivated and sowed, and which duly yielded me
their harvest in its season; and whenever I had occasion for

Besides this, I had my country seat; and I had now a tolerable

tall, always out so, t at they might spread and grow thick and
wild, and make the more agreeable shade, which they did
effectually to my mind. In the middle of this I had my tent
always standing, being a piece of a sail spread over poles, set up
for that pu ose, and which never wanted any repair or re-
newing; an under this I had made me a s uab or couch, with
the skins of the creatures I had killed, and wit other soft things;
and a. blanket laid on them, such as belonged to our sea bedding,
which I had saved, and a great watch-coat to cover me; and here,
whenever I had occasion to be absent from my chief seat, I took
up my country habitation.
Adjoining to this I had my enclosures for my cattle, that is to
lay, my goats; and as I had taken an inconceivable deal of pains
to fence and enclose this ground, I was so anxious to see it kept
entire, lest the goats should break through, that I never left off,

full of small stakes, and so near to one another, that it was
rather a pale than a hedge, and there was scarce room to put a
hand through between them; which afterwards, when those
stakes grew, as they all did in the next rainy season, made the
enclosure strong like a wall,—indeed, stronger than any wall.
This will testify for me that I was not idle, and that I spared
no pains to bring to pass whatever appeared necessary for my
comfortable support; for I considered the keeping up a breed
of tame creatures thus at my hand would be a living magazine

place, if it were to be forty years; and that keeping them in my
reach depended entirely upon my perfecting my enclosures to
such a degree, that I might be sure of keeping them together;
118 saves-wars or
these little stakes began to grow, I had planted them so very
thick, that I was forced to pull some of them up again.
In this place also I had my grapes growing, which I principally
depended on for my winter store of raisins, and which I never
failed to preserve very carefully, as the best and most agreeable
dainty of my whole diet: and, indeed, they were not only agree-
able, but medicinal, wholesome, nourishing, and refreshing to
the last degree.
As this was also about half-way between my other habitation
and the place where I had laid up my boat, I generally stayed
and lay here in my way thither: for I used frequently to visit my
boat; and I kept all things about or belonging to her, in very
good order: sometimes I went out in her to divert myself, but
no more hazardous voyages would I go, nor scarce ever above
a stone’s cast or two from the shore, I was so apprehensive of
being hurried out of my knowledge again by the currents or
winds, or any other accident. But now I come to a new scene
of my life.

UNEXPECTED ALARM AND CAUSE FOR APPREHENSION.—HE PORTI-
FIFS HIS ABODE.
IT happened one day, about noon, gomg towards my boat, I was
exceedingly surprised with the print of a man’s naked foot on the
shore, which was very plain to be seen in the sand. I stood like
one thunderstruck, or as if I had seen an apparition: I listened,
I looked round me, but I could hear nothing, nor see anything;
I went up to a rising ground, to look farther; I went up the
shore and down the shore, but it was all one; I could see no
other impression but that one. I went to it again to see if there
were any more, and to observe if it might not be my fancy; but
there was no room for that, for there was exactly the print of a
foot, toes, heel, and every part of a foot: how it came thither I
knew not, nor could I in the least imagine; but, after innumer-

I slept none that night: the farther I was from the occasion
of my fright, the greater my apprehensions were; which is
something contrary to the nature of such thing)s, and especially
to the usual ractice of all creatures in' fear; ut I was so em-
barrassed wit my own frightful ideas of the thing, that I formed
nothing but dismal imaginations to myself, even though I was
I20 anvsmvnas or
Devil, and reason joined in with me upon this supposition; for
how should any other thing in human shape come into the place?
Where was the vessel that brought them? What marks were
there of any other footsteps? And how was it possible a man
should come there? But then to think that Satan should take
human shape upon him in such a place, where there could be no
manner of occasion for it, but to leave the print of his foot behind
him, and that even for no purpose too, for he could not be sure
I should see it,—this was an amusement the other way. I con-
sidered that the Devil might have found out abundance of other

with the thing itself, and with all, the notions we usually enter-
tain of the subtlety of the Devil.
Abundance of such things as these assisted to argue me out of
all apprehensions of its being the Devil; and I presently con-
cluded, then, that it must be some more dangerous creature,
viz. that it must be some of the savages of the main land over
against me, who had wandered out to sea in their canoes, and,
either driven by the currents or by contrary winds, had made
the island, and had been on shore, but were gone away again to
sea; being as 10th, perhaps, to have stayed in this desolate
island as I would have been to have had them.

thereabouts at that time, or that they did not see my boat, by
which they would have concluded that some inhabitants had
been in the place, and perhaps have searched farther for me:
then terrible thoughts racked my imagination about their having
found my boat, and that there were people here; and that if
so,I should certainly have them come again in greater num-
bers, and devour me: that if it should happen so that they

experience as I had had of his goodness, as if he that had fed
me by miracle hitherto could not preserve, by his power, the
provision which he had made for me by his goodness. I re-
proached myself with my laziness, that would not sow any more
corn one year than would just serve me till the next season, as
if no accident would intervene to prevent in enjoying the crop
that was upon the ground; and this I thought so just a reprool',
that I resolved for the future to have two or three years’ corn
beforehand, so that, whatever might come, I might not perish
for want of bread.

tion was that I seemed banished from human society, that Iwas
alone, circumscribed by the boundless ocean, cut off from man-

one whom Heaven thought not worthy to be numbered among

have seen one of my own species would have seemed to me a

Heaven itself, next to the supreme blessing of salvation, could
bestow; I say, that I should now tremble at the very appre-

unquestioned duty to resign in self absolutely and entirely to
his will; and, on the other han -, it was my duty also to hope

directions of his daily providence.
These thoughts took me up many hours, days, nay, I may
say, weeks and months; and one particular effect of my cogita-
tions on this occasion I cannot omit. One morning early, lying
122 anvnm'unas or
appearances of savages, I found it discomposed me very much;
upon which these words of the Scripture came into my thoughts'
" Call upon me in the day of trouble, and I will deliver thee. and
thou shalt glorify me." Upon this, rising cheerfully out of my
bed, my heart was not only comforted, but Iwas guided and
encouraged to pray earnestly to God for deliverance: when I
had done praying, I took up my Bible, and opening it to read,

this gave me. In answer, I thankfully laid down the book, and
was no more sad, at least on that occasion.
122 anvnm'unas or
tions, it came into my thoughts one day, that all this might be a
mere chimera of my own, and that this foot might be the print
of my own foot, when I came on shore from my boat: this
cheered me up a little too, and I began to persuade myself it was
all a delusion; that it was nothing else but my own foot: and
why might I not come that way from the boat, as well as I was
going that way to the boat? Again, I considered also, that I
could by no means tell, for certain, where I had trod, and where
I had not; and that if, at last, this was only the print of my own
foot, I had played the part of those fools, who try to make
stories of spectres and apparitions, and then are frightened at
them more than anybody.
Now I began to take courage, and to peep abroad again, for I
had not stirred out of my castle for three days and nights, so
that I began to starve for provisions ; for I had little or nothing
within doors but some barley cakes and water: then I knew that
my goats wanted to be milked too, which usually was my
evening diversion; and the poor creatures were in great pain
and inconvenience for want of it : and, indeed, it almost spoiled
some of them, and almost dried up their milk. Encouraging
myself, therefore, with the belief that this was nothing but the
print of one of my own feet, and that I might be truly said to
start at my own shadow, I began to go abroad again, and went

time two or tl.ree days, and having seen nothing, I began to be
a little bolder, and to think there was really nothing in it but my

foot, and measure it by my own, and see if there was any simili-

evil which we are anxious about: and, which was worse than all
this, 1 had not that relief in this trouble from the resignation I
used to practise, that I hoped to have. I looked, I thought, like
Saul, who complained not only that the Philistines were upon
him, but that God had forsaken him; for I did not now take due
ways to compose my mind, by crying to God in my distress, and
resting upon his providence, as I had done before, for my defence
and deliverance; which, if I had done, I had at least been more
cheerfully supported under this new surprise, and perhaps
carried through it with more resolution.
This confusion of my thoughts kept me awake all night; but
in the morning I fell asleep; and having, by the amusement of
my mind, been as it were tired, and my spirits exhausted, I slept
very soundly and waked much better composed than I had ever
‘
been before. And nowI began to think sedately; and, upon
the utmost debate with ‘myself, I concluded that this island,
which was so exceeding pleasant, fruitful, and no farther from
the main land than as I had seen, was not so entirely abandoned
as I might imagine ; that although there were no stated inhabi-
tants who lived on the spot, yet that there might sometimes
come boats off from the shore, who, either with design, or per-
haps never but when they were driven by cross winds, might
come to this place; that I had lived here Wears now, and
[24 anvnnrunns or
and that if at any time they should be driven here, it was
probable they went away again as soon as ever they could,
[24 anvnnrunns or
that the most I could suggest any danger from, was from any
casual accidental landing of straggling people from the main,
who, as it was likely, if they were driven hither, were here
against their wills, so they made no stay here, but went off again
with all possible speed; seldom staying one night on shore, lest
they should not have the help of the tides and day-light back
again; and that, therefore, I had nothing to do but to consider
of some safe retreat, in case I should see any savages land upon
the spot.
Now I began sorely to repent that I had dug my cave so large
as to bring a door through again, which door, as I said, came out
[24 anvnnrunns or
eonsnlering this, therefore, I resolved to draw me a second forti-
[24 anvnnrunns or
my wall, just where I had planted a double row of trees about
twelve years before, of which I made mention : these trees
having been planted so thick before, they wanted but few piles
to be driven between them, that they might be thicker and
[24 anvnnrunns or
a double wall; and my outer wall was thickened with pieces of
timber, old cables, and everything I could think of, to make it
strong, having in it seven little holes about as big as I might
7 put my arm out at. In the inside of this, I thickened my wall to
about ten feet thick, with continually bringing earth out of my
cave, and laying it at the foot of the wall, and walking upon it;
and through the seven holes I contrived to plant the muskets, of
which I took notice that I had got seven on shore out of the ship:
[24 anvnnrunns or
[24 anvnnrunns or
guns in two minutes’ time: this wall I 'was many a weary
[24 anvnnrunns or
one.
When this was done, I stuck all the ground without my wall,
for a great length every way, as full with stakes, or sticks, of the
[24 anvnnrunns or
stand; insomuch, that I believe I might set in near twenty
thousand of them, leaving a pretty large space between then]
and my wall, that I might have room to see an enemy, and they
might have no shelter from the young trees, if they attempted to
approach my outer wall. , \ '

six years‘ time I had a wood before my dwelling, growing so
monstrous thick and strong, that it was indeed perfectly im-
passable; and no men, of What kind soever, would ever imagine
that there was anything beyond it, much less a habitation. As
for the way which I proposed to myself to go in and out (for I
left no avenue,) it was by setting two ladders, one to a part of
the rock which was low, and then broke in, and left room to
place another ladder upon that: so when the two ladders were
taken down, no man livi could come down to me without doing
himself mischief; and if t ey had come down, they were still on
the outside of my outer wall.
Thus I took all the measures human prudence could suggest
for my own preservation; and it‘ will be seen, at length, that
they were not altogether without just reason, though I foresaw
nothing at that time more than my mere fear suggested to me.

vouring to come back that way From the eastern part of the
island. Here I found a clear piece of land, near three acres, so
surrounded with woods, that it was almost an enclosure by
nature; at least, it did not want near so much labour to make 1!

in it: so, without any further delay, I removed ten young she—
goats and two he-goats to this piece; and when they were there,
I continued to perfect the fence, till I had made it as secure as
the other, which, however, I did at more leisure, and it took me
up more time by a. great deal. All this labour I was at the ex-
pense of purely from my apprehensions on the account of the
print of a man’s foot which I had seen; for, as yet, I never saw
any human creature come near the island; and I had now lived
two years under this uneasiness, which, indeed, made my life
muc less comfortable than it was before, as may be well ima-
gined by any who knows what it is to live in the constant
snare of the fear of man. And this I must observe, with grief
100, that the discomposure of my mind had too great impressions
also upon the religious part of my thoughts: for the dread and
terror of falling into the hands of savages and cannibals lay so
upon my spirits, that I seldom found myself in a due temper for
application to my Maker, at least not with the sedate calmness
and resignation of soul which I was wont to do : I rather prayed

and devoured before morning; and I must testify from my ex-

praiying to God being properly an act of the mind, not of the

But to go on : after I had thus secured one part of my little
living stock, I went about the whole island, searching for another
private place to make such another deposit; when, wandering
more to the west point of the island than I had ever done yet,
and looking out to sea, I thought I saw a boat upon the sea, at
a great distance. I had found a perspective glass or two in one
of the seamen’s chests, which I saved out of our ship, but I had
it not about me; and this was so remote, that I could not tell
what to make of it, though I looked at it till my eyes were not
able to hold to look any longer: whether it was a boat or not,
I do not know, but as I descended from the hill I could see no
more of it; so I gave it over; only I resolved to go no more out
without a perspective glass in my ocket. When I was come
down the hill to the end of the islan , where, indeed, I had never
been before, I was presently convinced that the seeing the print
of a man's foot was not such a strange thing in the island as I
imagined: and, but that it was a special providence that l was
cast upon the side of the island where the savages never came, I
should easily have known that nothing was more frequent than
for the canoes from the main, when they happened to be a little
too far out at sea, to shoot over to that side of the island for
harbour: likewise, as they often met and fought in their canoes,
the victors, having taken any prisoners, would bring them over
to this shore, where, according to their dreadful customs, being
all cannibals, they would kill and eat them; of which hereafter.
When I was come down the hill to the shore, as I said above,
being the south-west point of the island, I was perfectly con-
founded and amazed; nor is it possible for me to express the
horror of my mind, at seeing the shore spread with skulls, hands,
feet, and other bones of human bodies; and, articularly, I

dug in the earth, like a cockpit, where I supposed the savage
wretches had sat down to their inhuman feastings upon the
bodies of their fellow-creatures.
I was so astonished with the sight of these things, that I enter-
tained no notions of any danger to myself from it for a long
while: all my apprehensions were buried in the thoughts of
such a pitch of inhuman, hellish brutality, and the horror of the
degeneracy of human nature, which, though I had heard of in.
often, yet I never had so near a view of before: in short, I turned
away my face from the horrid spectacle; my stomach grew sick,
and I was just at the point of fainting, when nature discharged
the disorder from my stomach: and having vomited with uncom-
mon violence, I was a little relieved, but could not bear to stay
in the place a moment; so I got me up the hill again with
all the speed I could, and walked on towards my own habitation.
When I came a little out of that part of the island, I stood
still awhile, as amazed, and then recovering myself, I looked up
I25 ADVENTURE! or
I25 ADVENTURE! or
of the world where I was distinguished from such dreadful
creatures as these; and that, though I had esteemed my present
condition very miserable, had yet given me so many comforts in
it, that I had still more to give thanks for than to complain of :
and this, above all, that I had, even in this miserable condition,
been comforted with the knowledge of Himself, and the hope of
I25 ADVENTURE! or
valent to all the misery which I had suffered or could suffer.
In this frame of thankfulness, I went home to my castle, and
began to be much easier now, as to the safety of my circum-
stances, than ever I was before: for I observed that these
Wretches never came to this island in search of what they could
get; perhaps not seeking, not wanting, or not expecting, any-
thing here, and having often, no doubt, been up in the covered
I25 ADVENTURE! or
knew I had been here now almost eighteen years, and never saw
the least footsteps of human creature there before; and I might
be eighteen years more as entirely concealed as I was now, if I
did not discover myself to them, which I had no manner of occa-
sion to do; it being my only business to keep myself entirely
concealed where I was, unless I found a better sort of creatures
than cannibals to make myself known to. Yet I entertained
such an abhorrence of the savage wretches that I have been
speaking of, and of the wretched inhuman custom of their
devouring and eating one another up, that I continued pensive
and sad, and kept close within my own circle, for almost two
years after this; when I say my own circle, I mean by it my
three plantations, viz. my castle, my country seat, which I called
my bower, and my enclosure in the woods : nor did I look after
this for any other use than as an enclosure for my goats; for
the aversion which nature gave me to these hellish wretches was
such, that I was as fearful of seeing them as of seeing the Devil
himself. I did not so much as go to look after my boat all this
time, but began rather to think of making me another; for l
could not think of ever making any more attempts to bring the
other boat round the island to me, lest I should meet with some
of these creatures at sea: in which if I had happened to have
fallen into their hands,I knew what would have been my lot.
Time, however, and the satisfaction I had that I was in no
' danger of being discovered by these people, began to wear off
my uneasiness about them; and I began to live just in the same
composed manner as before, only with this difference, that I used
more caution, and kept my eyes more about me, than I did before,
lest I should happen to be seen by any of them; and particularly,
nanmson causes. 129
the island should happen to hear it. It was therefore a very
00d providence to me that I had furnished myself with a tame
greed of goats, and that I had no need to hunt any more about
the woods, or shoot at them; and if I did catch any of them after
this, it was by traps and snares, as I had done before: so that
nanmson causes. 129
though I never went out without it; and, which was more, as I
had saved three pistols out of the ship, I always carried them out
with me, or at least two of them, sticking them in my goat’s-skin
belt. I also furbished up one of the great cutlasses that I had
out of the ship, and made me a belt to hang it on also; so that
I was now a most formidable fellow to look at when I went
abroad, if you add to the former description of myself, the par-
ticular of two pistols, and a great broadsword hanging at my
side in a belt, but without a scabbard.
Things going on thus, as I have said, for some time, I seemed,
excepting these cautions, to be reduced to my former calm sedate
way of living. All these things tended to show me, more and
more, how far my condition was from being miserable, compared
to some others; nay, to many other particulars of life, which it
might have pleased God to have made my lot. It put me upon
nanmson causes. 129
any condition of life,_if people would rather compare their con-
dition with those that were worse, in order to be thankful, than
be always comparing them with those which are better, to assist
their murmurings and complainings.
As in my present condition there were not really many things
which I wanted, so, indeed, I thought that the frights I had been
in about these savage wretches, and the concern I had been in
for my own preservation, had taken off the edge of my invention
for my own conveniences; and Ihad dropped a good design,
which I had once bent my thoughts too much upon, and that
was, to try if I could not make some of my barley into malt, and
then try to brew myself some beer. This was really a whimsical
thought, and I reproved myself often for the simplicity of it; for
I presently saw there would be the want of several things neces-
sary to the making my beer, that it would be impossible for me
I80 ADVENTURES O!
that, as I had observed already, I could never compass; no,
though I spent not only many days, but weeks, nay, months,
in attempting it, but to no purpose. In the next place, I had no
hops to make it keep, no yeast to make it work, no copper or
kettle to make it boil; and yet, with all these things wanting, I
verily believe, had not the frights and tenors I was in about the
savages intervened, I had undertaken it, and perhaps brought it
to pass too; for I seldom gave anything over without accom-
plishing it, when once I had it in my head to begin it. But my
invention now ran quite another way; for, night and day, I could
think of nothing buthow I might destroy some of these monsters
in their cruel, bloody entertainment, and, if possible, save the
victim they should bring hither to destroy. It would take up a
larger volume than this whole work is intended to be, to set down
all the contrivances I hatched, or rather brooded upon, in my
thoughts, for the destroying these creatures, or at least fri hten-
ing them so as to prevent their coming hither any more; ut all
I80 ADVENTURES O!
less I was to be there to do it myself; and what could one man
do among them, when perhaps there might be twenty or thirty
of them together, with their darts, or their bows and arrows,
with which they could shoot as true to a mark as I could with my

place, I should be unwilling to waste so much powder upon them,
my store being now within the quantity of one barrel, so neither
could I be sure of its going off at any certain time, when it might
surprise them: and, at best, that it would do little more than
I80 ADVENTURES O!

and then proposed that I would place myself in ambush in some
convenient place, with my three guns all double-loaded, and, in
I80 ADVENTURES O!
should be sure to kill or wound perhaps two or three at every
shot: and then falling in upon them with my three pistols, and
my sword, I made no doubt but that if there were twenty]

weeks; and I was so full of it, that I often dreamed of it, and

bloody putting twenty or thirty of them to the swbrd, as I may
call it, the horror I had at the place, and at the signals of the
' barbarous wretches devouring one another, abetted my malice.
Well, at length, I found a place in the side of the hill, where l

come on shore, convey myself, unseen, into some thickets of trees.
in one of which there was a hollow large enough to conceal me
entirely; and there I might sit and observe all their bloody doings,
and take my full aim at their heads, when they were so close
together, as that it would be next to impossible that I should miss
my shot, or that I could fail wounding three or four of them at
memos cursor. 131
and, accordingly, I prepared two muskets and my ordinary fowl-
ingpiece. The two muskets I loaded with a brace of slugs each,
memos cursor. 131
and the fowlingpiece I loaded with near a handful of swan-shot,
of the largest size: I also loaded my pistols with about four
bullets each; and in this posture, well provided with ammunition
for a second and third charge, I prepared myself for my expedition.
After I had thus laid the scheme of my design, and, in my
imagination, put it in practice, I continually made my tour every
morning up to the top of the hill, which was from my castle, as
I called it, about three miles, or more, to see if I could observe
any boats upon the sea, coming near the island, or standing over
towards it: but I began to tire of this hard duty, after I had,
for two or three months, constantly kept my watch, but came
always back without any discovery: there having not, in all that
time, been the least appearance, not only on or near the shore,
but on the whole ocean, so far as my eyes or glasses could reach
every way.
As long as I kept my dally tour to the hill to look out, so Ion
also I kept up the vigour of my design, and my spirits seeme
to be all the while in a suitable form for so outrageous an execu-

conceived at the unnatural custom of the people of that country;
who, it seems, had been suffered by Providence, in his wise dis-
position of the world, to have no other guide than that of their
own abominable and vitiated passions; and, consequently, were
left, and perhaps had been so for some ages, to act such horrid
things, and receive such dreadful customs, as nothing but nature,
entirely abandoned by Heaven, and actuated by some hellish
degeneracy, could have run them into. But now, when, as I
have said, I began to be weary of the fruitless excursion, which
Ihad made so long and so far every morning in vain, so In
opinion of the action itself began to alter; and I began, wi
cooler and calmer thoughts, to consider what I was going to en-
gage in: what authority or call I had to pretend to be judge and
executioner upon these men as criminals, whom Heaven had
132 anvnmnns or
and to be, as it were, the executioners of his judgments one
upon another. How far these people were offenders against me,
and what right I had to engage in the quarrel of that blood which
they shed promiscuously one upon another, I debated this ver
often with myself, thus: How do I know what God himsef
judges in this particular case? It is certain these people do not
commit this as a crime; it is not against their own consciences
reproving, or their light reproaching them; they do not know it
132 anvnmnns or
as we do in almost all the sins we commit. They think it no more
a crime to kill a captive taken in war, than we do to kill an ox;
132 anvnmnns or
When I considered this a little, it followed necessarily that l
was certainly in the wrong in it; that these people were not
murderers in the sense that I had before condemned them in my
thoughts, any more than those Christians were murderers who
132 anvnmnns or
qnently, upon many occasions, put whole troops of men to the
sword, without giving quarter, though they threw down their
arms and submitted. In the next place, it occurred to me, that
although the usage they gave one another was thus brutish and
inhuman, yet it was really nothing to me; these people had done
me no injury: that if they attempted me, or I saw it necessary,
for my immediate preservation, to fall upon them, somethin
might be said for it; but that I was yet out of their power, an
they really had no knowledge of me, and consequently no design
upon me; and therefore it could not be just for me to fall upon
them: that this would justify the conduct of the Spaniards in all
their barbarities practised in America, where they destroyed
millions of these people : who, however they were idolaters and
barbarians, and had several bloody and barbarous rites in their
132 anvnmnns or
yet, as to the Spaniards, very innocent people; and that the
rooting them out of the country is spoken of with the utmost
abhorrence and detestation by even the Spaniards themselves at
this time, and by all other Christian nations in Europe, as a mere
132 anvnmnns or
either to God or man, and for which the very name of a Spaniard
is reckoned to be frightful and terrible to all people of humanity,
or of Christian compassion,-—as if the kingdom of Spain were
particularly eminent for the produce of a race of men who were
without princi les of tenderness, or the common bowels of pity
_ to the misera 1e, which is reckoned to be a mark of generous
temper in the mind-
These considerations really put me to a pause, and to a kind

and to conclude I had taken wrong measures in my resolution
to attack the savages; and that it was not my business to med-
IOBINSON causes. 133
my business, if possible, to prevent; but that if I were discovered
and attacked by them, I knew my duty. On the other hand, I
argued with myself, that this really was the way not to deliver
myself, but entirely to ruin and destroy myself; for unless I was
sure to kill every one that not only should be on shore at
that time, but that should ever come on shore afterwards, if but
one of them escaped to tell their country-people what had hap-
pened, they would come over again by thousands to revenge the
death of their fellows, and I should only bring upon myself a
certain destruction, which, at present,‘ I had no manner of
occasion for. Upon the whole, I concluded, that neither in
principle nor in policy I ought, one way or other, to concern
myselfin this affair: that my business was, by all possible means,
to conceal myself from them, and not to leave the least signal
to them to guess by that there were ahy living creatures upon
the island, I mean of human shape. Religion joined in with this
prudential resolution, and I was convinced now, many ways,
that I was perfectly out of my duty when I was laying all my
bloody schemes for the destruction of innocent creatures, I mean
innocent as to me. As to the crimes they were guilty of towards
one another, Ihad nothing to do with them; they were national.
and I ought to leave them to the justice of God, who is the
governor of nations, and knows how, by national punishments,
to make a just retribution for national offences, and to bring
public judgments upon those who offend in a public manner, by
such ways as best please him. This appeared so clear to me
now, that nothing was a greater satisfaction to me than that I
had not been suffered to do a thing which I now saw so much
reason to believe would have been no less a sin than that of
wilful murder, if I had committed it; and I gave most humble
thanks on my knees to God, that had thus delivered me from
blood-guiltiness; beseeching him to grant me the protection or
his providence, that I might not fall into the hands of the bar-
barians, or that I might not lay my hands upon them, unless I
had a more ‘clear call from Heaven to do it, in defence of my
own life.

ROBINSON DISCOVERS A CAVE, WHI'CI-I SERVE HIM AS A RETREAT
AGAINST THE SAVAGES.
IN this disposition I continued for near a year after this; and
so far was I from desiring an occasion for falling upon these
wretches, that in all that time I never once went up the hill to
see whether there were any of them in sight, or to know whether
any of them had been on shore there or not, that I might not be
tempted to renew any of my contrivances against them, or be
provoked, by any advantage which might present itself, to fall
upon them: only this I did, I went and removed my boat, which
I had on the other side of the island, and carried it down to the
east end of the whole island, where I ran it into a little cove,
which I found under some high rocks, and where I knew, by
reason of the currents, the savages durst not, at least would not,
come with their boats, upon any account whatever. W'ith my
boat I carried away every thing that I had left there belonging
to her, though not necessary for the bare going thither, viz. a
mast and sail which I had made for her, and a thing like an
anchor, but which, indeed, could not be called either anchor or
grapnel; however, it was the best I could make of its kind: all
these I removed, that there might not be the least shadow of
any discovery, or any appearance of any boat, or of any human
habitation, upon the island. Besides this, I kept myself, as I
said, more retired than ever, and seldom went from my cell, other
than upon my constant employment, viz. to milk my she-goats,

certain it is, that these savage people, who sometimes haunted

here, and consequently never wandered off from the coast: and
I doubt not but they might have been several times on shore
after my apprehensions of them had made me cautious, as well
as before. Indeed, I looked back with some horror upon the
thoughts of what my condition would have been if I had popped
upon them and been discovered before that, when, naked and
unarmed, except with one gun, and that loaded often only with
small shot, I walked everywhere, peeping and peering about the
island to see what I could get; what a surprise should I have
been in, if, when I discovered the print of a man’s foot, Ihad,

ursuing me, and by the swiftness of their running, no possibi-
'ty of my escaping them? The thoughts of this sometimes sunk
my very soul within me, and distressed my mind so much, that
I could not soon recover it, to think what I should have done,
and how I should not only have been unable to resist them, but
even should not have had resence of mind enough to do what
I might have done, much ess what now, after so much con-
sideration and preparation, I might be able to do. Indeed, after
serious thinking on these things, I would be very melancholy,
and sometimes it would last a great while; but I resolved it all,
at last, into thankfulness to that Providence which had. delivered
me from so many unseen dangers, and had kept from me those
mischiefs which I could have no way been the agent in deliver-
ing myself from, because I had not the least notion of any such
thing depending, or the least supposition of its being possible.
This renewed a contemplation which often had come to my

dispositions of Heaven, in the dangers we run through in this
life; how wonderfully we are delivered when we know nothing
of it; how, when we are in (a quandary, as we call it) a doubt
or hesitation, whether to go this way, or that way, a secret hint
shall direct us this way, when we intended to go that way: nay,
when sense, our own inclination, and perhaps business, has
called to go the other way, yet a strange impression upon the
mind, from we know not what springs, and by we know not what
power, shall overrule us to go this way; and it shall afterwards
appear, that had we gone that way which we should have gone,
and even to our imagination ought to have gone, we should have

afterwards made it a certain rule with me, that whenever I found
those secret hints or pressings of mind, to doing or not doing
an thing that presented, or going this wa or that way, I never
failed to obey the secret dictate; though I ew no other reason
for it than that such a pressure, or such a hint, hung upon my
mind. I could give many examples of the success of this con-
duct in the course of my life, but more especially in the latter
part of my inhabiting this unhappy island; besides many occasions
which it is very likely I might have taken notice of, if I had seen
with the same eyes then that I see with now But it is never too
late to be wise; and I cannot but advise all considering men,
whose lives are attended with such extraordinary incidents as
mine, or even though not so extraordinary, not to slight such
Secret intimations of Providence, let them coine from what in-
visible intelligence they will. That I shall not discuss, and per-
haps cannot account for; but certainly they are a proof of the
converse of spirits, and a secret communication between those
embodied and those unemhodied, and such a proof as can never
be withstood; of which I shall have occasion to give some very
remarkable instances in the remainder of my solitary residence
in this dismal place. -
I believe the reader of this will not think it strange if I con-
fess that these anxieties, these constant dangers I lived in, and
the concern that was now upon me, put an end to all invention,
and to all the contrivances that I had laid for my future accom-
modations and conveniences. I had the care of my safety more
now upon my hands than that of my food. I cared not to drive
a nail, or chop a stick of wood now, for fear the noise I might

same reason: and, above all, I was intolerably uneasy at making
i36 Abvanruaas or
the day, should betray me. For this reason I removed that part
i36 Abvanruaas or
pipes, &c. into my new apartment in the woods; where, after
I had been some time, I found, to my unspeakable consolation,
a mere natural cave in the earth, which went in a vast way, and
where, I dare say, no savage, had he been at the mouth of it,
would be so hardy as to venture in: nor, indeed, would any
man else, but one who, like me, wanted nothing so much as a
safe retreat.
The mouth of this hollow was at the bottom of a great rock,
where by mere accident (I would say, if I did not see abundant
reason to ascribe all such things now to Providence) I was
cutting down some thick branches of trees to make charcoal;
and, before I go on, I must observe the reason of my making
this charcoal, which was thus: I was afraid of making a smoke
about my habitation, as I said before; and yet I could not live
there without baking my bread, cooking my meat, &c. ; so I con-
trived to burn some wood here, as I had seen done in England,
under turf, till it became chark, or dry coal: and then putting
i36 Abvanruaas or
i36 Abvanruaas or
smoke. But this is by the by. While I was cutting down some
wood here, I perceived that behind a very thick branch of low
brushwood, or underwood, there was a kind of hollow place: 1

to stand upright in it, and perhaps another with me: but I must
confess to you that I made more haste out than I did in, when,
looking farther into the place, and which was perfectly dark, I
saw two broad shining eyes of some creature, whether devil or
man I knew not, which twinkled like two stars, the dim light
from the cave’s mouth shining directly in, and making the re-

steps in, but I was almost as much frightened as I was before;
for I heard a very loud sigh, like that of a man in some pain,
and it was followed by a broken noise, as of words half expressed,
and then a deep sigh again. I stepped back, and was indeed
struck with such a surprise, that it put me into a cold sweat;
and if I had had a hat on my head, I will not answer for it, that
my hair might not have lifted it off. But still plucking up my
spirits as well as I could, and encouraging myself a little with
considering that the power and presence of God was every where,
and was able to protect me, upon this I stepped forward again,

head, I saw lying on the ground a most monstrous, frightful, old
he-goat, just making his will, as we say, and gasping for life, and
dying, indeed, of mere old age. I stirred him a little to see if I
could get him out, and he essayed to get up, but was not able
to raise himself; and I thought with myself he might even lie
there; for if he had frightened me, so he would certainly fright
any of the savages, if any of them should be so hardy as to come
in there while he had any life in him.
I was now recovered from my surprise, and began to look round
me, when I found the cave was but very small, that is to say, it
might be about twelve feet over, but in no manner of shape,
neither round nor square, no hands having ever been employed
in making it but those of mere Nature. I observed also that
there was a place at the farther side of it that went in further,
but was so low that it required me to creep upon my hands and
knees to go into it, and whither it went I knew not: so having
no candle, I gave it over for that time; but resolved to come
again the next day, provided with candles and a tinder-box, which
I had made of the lock of one of the muskets, with some wild-
aormson censor. 18'!
Accordingly, the next day I came provided with six large
candles of my own making (for I made very good candles now
of goat's tallow, but was hard set for candle-wick, using some-
I38 mvam'vam or
times rags or rope-yarn, and sometimes the dried rind of a weed
like nettles); and going into this low place, I was obliged to
creep upon all fours, as I have said, almost ten yards; which, by
the way, I thought was a venture bold enough, considering that
I knew not how far it might go, nor what was beyond it.
When I had got through the strait, I found the roof rose higher
up, I believe near twenty feet; but never was such a glorious
sight seen in the island, I dare say, as it was, to look round the
I38 mvam'vam or
thousand lights to me from my two candles. What it was in the
rock, whether diamonds, or any other precious stones, or gold,
which I rather supposed it to be, Iknew not. The place I was in
was a most delightful cavity or grotto of its kind, as could be ex-
I38 mvam'vam or
asort of asmall loose gravel uponit, so that there was no nauseous
or venomous creature to be seen, neither was there any damp or
I38 mvam'vam or
which, however, as it was a place of security, and such a retreat
as I wanted, I thought that was a convenience; so that I was
really rejoiced at the discovery, and resolved, without any delay,
to bring some of those things which I was most anxious about
to this place; particularly, I resolved to bring hither my maga-
zine of powder, and all my spare arms, viz. two fowling-pieees,
for I had three in all, and three muskets, for of them I had eight
I38 mvam'vam or
mounted like pieces of cannon, on my outmost fence, and were
ready also to take out upon any expedition. Upon this occasion
of removing my ammunition, I happened to open the barrel of
powder which I took up out of the sea, and which had been wet;
and I found that the water had penetrated about three or four
inches into the powder on every side, which caking and growing
hard, had preserved the inside like a kernel in the shell; so that
I had near sixty pounds of very good powder in the centre of the
cask : this was a very agreeable discovery to me at that time;
so I carried all away thither, never keeping above two or three
pounds of powder with me in my castle, for fear of a surprise of
any kind: I also carried thither all the lead I had left for bullets.
I fancied myself now like one of the ancient giants, which were
said to live in caves and holes in the rocks, where none could
come at them; for I persuaded myself, while I was here, that if
I38 mvam'vam or
out; or, if they did, they would not venture to attack me here.
The old goat, whom I found expiring, died in the mouth of the
cave the next day after I made this discovery: and I found it
much easier to dig a great hole there, and throw him in and cover
him with earth, than to drag him out; so I interred him there,
to prevent offence to my nose.
I was now in the tWd year of my residence in this
island; and was so naturalized to the place, and the manner of
living, that could I have but enjoyed the certainty that no
savages would come to the place to disturb me, I could have
been content to have capitulated for spending the rest of my
time there, even to the last moment, till I had laid me down and
died, like the old goat in the cave. I had also arrived to some
little diversions and amusements, which made the time pass a
aoamsou cavson. 139
I had taught my Poll, as I noted before, to speak; and he did it
so familiarly, and talked so articulatel and plain, that it was
very pleasant to me: for I believe no ird ever spoke plainer;
and he lived with me no less than six-and-twenty years: how
long he might have lived afterwards I know not, though I
know they have a notion in the Brazils that they live a hundred
years. M dog was a very pleasant and loving companion to
me for no less than sixteen years of my time, and then died of
mere old age. As for my cats, they multi lied, as I have observed,
to that degree, that I was obliged to s oot several of them at
aoamsou cavson. 139
length, when the two old ones I brought with me were gone,
and after some time continually driving them from me, and letting
them have no provision with me, they all ran wild into the woods,
except two or three favourites, which I kept tame, and whose
young, when they had any, I always drowned; and these were
part of my family. Besides these, I always kept two or three
ousehold kids about me, whom I taught to feed out of in hand;
and I had two more parrots, which talked pretty well, an would

take the pains with any of them that I had done with him. I
had also several tame seafowls, whose names I knew not, that
I caught upon the shore, and cut their wings; and the little
stakes which I had planted before my castle wall being now
grown up to a good thick grove, these fowls all lived among
these low trees, and bred there, which was very agreeable to me:
so that, as I said above, I began to be very well contented with
the life I led, if I could have been secured from the dread of the
savages. But it was otherwise directed; and it may not be amiss
for all people who shall set with my story, to make this just
observation from it, viz. How frequently, in the course of our
lives, the evil which in itself we seek most to shun, and which,
when we are fallen into, is the most dreadful to us, is oftentimes
the very means or door of our deliverance, by which alone we

ANOTHER VISIT OF THE SAVAGES.—IIOBINSON SEES THEM DANCING
--PERCEIVES THE WRECK OF A VFSSEL.
IT was now the month of December, as I said above, in my
twenty-third year; and this being the southern solstice (for
winter I cannot call it), was the particular time of my harvest,

going out pretty early in the morning, even before it was thorough

the shore, at a distance from me of about two miles, towards the
end of the island where I had observed some savages had been,

it was on my side of the island.
I was indeed terribly surprised at the sight, and stopped short
within my grove, not daring to go out, lest I might be surprised;
and yet I had no more peace within, from the apprehensions I
had that if these savages, in rambling over the island, should

in the place, and would then never give over till they had found
me out. In this extremity, I went back directly to my castle,
pulled up the ladder after me, and made all things Without look
as wild and natural as I could.
Then I prepared myself within, putting myself in a posture 01
defence: I loaded all my cannon, as I called them, that is to say,
140 ADVENTURES or
and all my pistols, and resolved to defend myself to the last
gasp; not forgetting seriously to commend myself to the divine
rotection, and earnestly to pray to God to deliver me out of the
do of the barbarians. I continued in this posture abont two

for I had no spies to send out. After sitting awhile longer, and
musing what I should do in this, I was not able to bear sitting

about my harvest work with the more composure.
As I expected, so it proved; for as soon as the tide made to
the westward, I saw them all take boat, and row (or paddle, as
we call it) away. I should have observed, that for an hour or
more before they went off, the went a dancing; and I could
easily discern their postures an gestures by my glass. I could
not perceive, by my nicest observation, but that they were stark
naked, and had not the least covering upon them; but whether
they were men or women, I could not distinguish.
As soon as I saw them shipped and gone, I took two guns
upon my shoulders, and two pistols in my girdle, and my great
sword by my side, without a scabbard, and with all the speed I
was able to make, went away to the hill where I had discovered

so loaden with arms as I was), I perceived there ad been three

This was a dreadful sight to me, especially as, going down to the
shore, I could see the marks of horror, which the dismal work
the had been about had left behind it, viz. the blood, the bones,

indignation at the sight, that I now began to premeditate the
destruction of the next that I saw there, let them be Whom
or how many soever. It seemed evident to me that the visits
which they made thus to this island were not very frequent, for

shore there again; that is to say, I neither saw them, nor any
footsteps or signals of them, in all that time; for, as to the rainy
seasons, then they are sure not to come abroad, at least not so
far: yet all this while I lived uncomfortably, by reason of the
constant apprehensions of their coming upon me by surprise:
from whence I observe, that the expectation of evil is more bitter
than the suffering, especially if there is no room to shake of!
that expectation, or those apprehensions.
During all this time I was in the murdering humour, and took
up most of my hours, which should have been better employed,
in contriving how to circumvent and fall upon them, the very next
time I should see them; especially if they should be divided, as
they were the last time, into two parties: nor did I consider at
all, that if I killed one party, suppose ten or a dozen, I was still
the next day, or week, or month, to kill another, and so another,
142 ADVENTURES or
than they were in being man-eaters, and perhaps much more so.
I spent my days now in great perplexity and anxiety of mind,
expecting that I should, one day or other, fall into the hands of
these merciless creatures; and if I did at any time venture
abroad, it was not without looking round me with the greatest
care and caution imaginable. And now I found, to my great

especially near that side of the island, where they usually came,
142 ADVENTURES or
now, I was sure to have them come again, with perhaps two or
three hundred canoes with them, in a few days, and then I knew
what to expect. However, I wore out a year and three months
more before I ever saw any more of the savages, and then I
found them again, as I shall soon observe. It is true, they
might have been there once or twice, but either they made no
stay, or at reast I did not see them ; “bptin the month of May,

months’interval, was very great ; I slept unquiet, dreamed always
frightful dreams, and often started out of my sleep in the night:
in the day, great troubles overwhelmed my mind; and in the
night, I dreamed often of killing the savages, and of the reasons
why I might justify the doing of it. But to waive all this for a
while—It was in the middle of May, on the sixteenth day, I
think, as well as my poor wooden calendar would reckon, for I
marked all upon the post still; I say, it was on the sixteenth of
May that it blew a very great storm of wind all day, with a great
deal of lightning and thunder, and a very foul night it was after
it. I knew not what was the particular occasion of it, but as l
was reading in the Bible, and taken up with very serious thoughts
about my present condition, I was surprised with the noise of a
ROBINSON citimoi. 143

notions this put into my thoughts were quite of another kind.
I started up in the greatest haste imaginable, and, in a trice,
clapped my ladder to the middle place of the rock, and pulled it

gun, which accordingly, in about half a minute, I heard; and, by
'the sound, knew that it was from that part of the sea where I
was driven down the current in my boat. I immediately con-
sidered that this must be some ship in distress, and that they had

for signals of distress, and to obtain help. I had the presence of
mind, at that minute, to think that though I could not help them,
it might be they might help me: so, I brought together all the
dry wood I could get at hand, and making a good handsome pile,

freely; and though the wind blew very hard, yet it burnt fairly
out: so thatI was certain, if there was any such thing as a ship,
they must needs see it; and no doubt they did; for as soon as

till daybreak; and when it was broad day, and the air cleared up,
I saw something at a great distance at sea, full cast of the island,
whether a sail or a hull I could not distinguish, no, not with my
glass; the distance was so great, and the weather still something
hazy also; at least it was so out at sea.
I looked frequently at it all that day, and soon perceived that
it did not move; so I presently concluded that it was a ship at
ROBINSON citimoi. 143
my gun in my hand, an ran towards the south side of the
island, to the rocks where I had formerly been carried away with
the current; and getting up there, the weather by this time being
perfectly clear, I could plainly see, to my great sorrow, the
wreck of a ship, cast away in the night upon those concealed
rocks which I found when I was out in my boat; and which
rocks, as they checked the violence of the stream, and made a
kind of counter-stream, or eddy, were the occasion of my
recovering from the most desperate, hopeless condition that
ever I had been in, in all my life. Thus, what is one man's
safety is another man's destruction; for it seems these men,

night, the wind blowing hard at E. N. E. Had they seen the

as I thought, have endeavoured to have saved themselves on

many thoughts: First, I imagined that upon seeing my light,
they might have put themselves into their boat, and endeavoured
to make the shore; but that the sea going very high, they might
have been cast away: other times I imagined that they might
have lost their boat before, as might be the case many ways; as
particularly, by the breaking of the sea upon their ship, which
many times obliges men to stave, or take in pieces, their boat,
and sometimes to throw it overboard with their own hands:
other times I imagined they had some other ship or ships in
company, who, upon the signals of distress they had made, had
taken them up and carried them off: other times I fancied they
were all gone off to sea in their boat, and being hurried away by
the current that I had been formerly in, were carried out into
the great ocean, where there was nothing but misery and perish-
ing; and that perhaps, they might by this time be starving, and
in a condition to think of eating one another.
As all these were but conjectures at best, so, in the condition
I was in, I could do no more than look on upon the misery of the
poor men, and pity them; which had still this good effect on my
side, that it gave me more and more cause to give thanks to God.
who had so happily and comfortably provided for me in my
desolate condition; and that of two ship’s companies who were
now cast away upon this part of the world, not one life should
be spared but mine. I learned here again to observe, that it is
very rare that the providence of God casts us into any condition
of life so low, or any misery so great, but we may see something
or other to be thankful for, and may see others in worse circum-
stances than our own. Such certainly was the case of these
men, of whom I could not so much as see room to suppose any
of them were saved; nothing could make it rational so much as
to wish or expect that they did not all perish there, except the
possibility only of their being taken up by another ship in com-
pany; and this was but mere possibility indeed. for 1 saw not the
least sign or appearance of any such thing. I cannot explain, by
any possible energy of words, what a strange longing or han-
kering of desires I felt in my soul upon this sight, breaking out
sometimes thus—O that there had been but one or two, nay, or
but one soul saved out of this ship, to have escaped to me, that
I might but have had one companion, one fellow-creature to have
spoken to me, and to have conversed with! In all the time of my
solitary life, I never felt so earnest, so strong a desire alter the
society of my fellow-creatures, or so deep a regret at the want ofit

when they are set a going by some object inview, or, though not
in view, yet rendered present to the mind by the power of imagi-
nation, that motion carries out the soul, by its impetuosity, to
such violent, eager embracings of the object, that the absence of
it is insupportable. Such were these earnest wishings that but
one man had been saved. I believe I repeated the words, “ O
that it had been but one!" a thousand times; and my desires
were so moved by it, that when I spoke the words my hands

my hands so, that if I had had any soft thing in my hand it would
have crushed it involuntarily; and the teeth in my head would
strike together, and set against one another so strong, that for
some time I could not part them again. Let the naturalists
explain these things, and the reason and manner of them: all I
can say to them is, to describe the fact, which was even surprising
to me, when I found it, though I knew not from whence it pro-
ceeded: it was doubtless the effect of ardent wishes, and of strong
ideas formed in my mind, realising the comfort which the con~
versation of one of my fellow-Christians would have been to me.
But it was not to be; either their fate or mine, or both, forbade
it: for till the last year of my being on this island, I never knew
whether any were saved out of that ship or no; and had only the

I46 Lover-roars or
wreck. He had no clothes on but a seaman’s waistcoat, a pair
of open-kneed linen drawers, and a blue linen shirt; but nothing
to direct me so much as to guess what nation he was of : he had
nothing in his pockets but two pieces-of-eight and a tobacco
I46 Lover-roars or
It was now calm, and I had a great mind to venture out in my
I46 Lover-roars or
board that might be useful to me: but that did not altogether
press me so much, as the possibility that there might be yet some
iving creature on board, whose life I might not only save, but
might, by saving that life, comfort my own to the last degree.
And this thought clung so to my heart, that I could not be quiet
night or da , but I must venture out in my boat on board this
wreck; an committing the rest to God's providence, I thought
the impression was so strong upon my mind that it could not be
resisted, that it must come from some invisible direction. and that
I should be wanting to myself if 1 did not go.
Under the power of this impression, I hastened back to my
castle, prepared everything for my voyage, took a quantity of
bread, a great pot of fresh water, a compass to steer by, a bottle
of rum (for I had still a great deal of that left), and a basket of
raisins; and thus loading myself with everything necessary, 1
I46 Lover-roars or
loaded all my cargo in her, and then went home again for more.
My second cargo was a great bag of rice, the umbrella to set up
over my head for a shade, another large pot of fresh water, and
about two dozen of my small loaves, or barley-cakes, more than
7 before, with a bottle of goat’s milk and a cheese: all which, with
great labour and sweat, I carried to my boat; and praying to
God to direct my voyage, I put out; and rowing, or paddling,
the canoe along the shore, came at last to tlze utmost point of
the island on the north-east side. And now] was to launch out
into the ocean, and either to venture or not to venture. I looked
on the rapid currents which ran constantly on both sides of the
island at a distance, and which were very terrible _to me, from the
remembrance of the hazard I had been in before, and my heart
began to fail me: for I foresaw that if I was driven into either of
those currents, I should be carried a great way out to sea, and
perhaps out of my reach, or sight of the island again ; and that,
then, as my boat was but small, if any little gale of wind should
rise, I should be inevitably lost.
These thoughts so oppressed my mind, that I began to give
over my enterprise; and having hauled my boat into a little
creek on the shore, I stepped out, and sat me down upon a rising
bit of ground, very pensive and anxious, between fear and desire,
about my voyage: when, as I was musing, I could perceive that
I46 Lover-roars or
going was impracticable for so many hours. Upon this, prm
scntly, it occurred to me that I should go up to the highest piece

which carried me at a great rate, and yet did not so hurry me
as the current on the south side had done before, so as to take
from me all government of the boat; but having a strong steer-
age with my paddle, I went at a great rate directly for the wreck,
and in less than two hours 1 came up to it. It was a dismal
sight to look at: the ship, which, by its building, was Spanish,
stuck fast, jammed in between two rocks; all the stern and
uarter of her were beaten to pieces with the sea; and as her.
forecastle, which stuck in the rocks, had run on with great
violence, her mainmast and foremast were brought by the board,
that is to say, broken short off; but her bowsprit was sound,

and cried; and as soon as I called him jumped into the sea to
come to me. I took him into the boat, but found him almost
dead with hunger and thirst. I gave him a cake of my bread,
and he devoured it like a ravenous wolf that had been starving
a fortnight in the snow. - I then gave the poor creature some
fresh water, with which, if I would have let him, he would have

I met with was twormen drowned in the cook room, or forecastls
of the ship, with their arms fast about one another. I concluded.
as is indeed probable, that when the ship struck, it being in a
storm, the sea broke so high, and so continually over her, that
the men were not able to bear it, and were strangled with the
constant rushing in of the water, as much as if they had been
under water. Besides the do , there was nothing left in the ship
that had life; nor any 00 , that I could see, but what were
spoiled by the water 'I‘ ere were some casks of liquor, whethg
wine or brandy I knew not, which lay lower in the hold, and
which, the water being ebbed out, I could see; but they were
too big to meddle with. I saw several chests, which I believed
belonged to some of the seamen; and I got two of them into
the boat, without examinin what was in them. Had the stern
I48 Anvsm'uass or
suaded I might have made a good voyage : for, by what I found
in these two chests, I had room to suppose the ship had a great
deal of wealth on board; and, if I may guess from the course
she steered, she must have been bound from Buenos Ayres, or
the Rio de la Plata, in the south part of America, beyond the
Brazils, to the Havanna, in the Gulf of Mexico, and so perhaps
to Spain. She had, no doubt, a great treasure in her, but of no
use, at that time, to anybody; and what became of her crew, I
then knew not.
I found, besides these chests, a little cask full of liquor, of
about twenty gallons, which I got into my boat with much
I48 Anvsm'uass or
powder-horn, with about four pounds of powder in it: as for the
muskets, I had no occasion for them, so I left them, but took
I48 Anvsm'uass or
extremely; as also two little brass kettles, a copper pot to make
chocolate, and a gridiron: and with this cargo, and the dog, I
came away, the tide beginning to make home again; and the
same evening, about an hour within night, I reached the island
again, weary and fatigued to the last degree. I reposed that
night in the boat; and in the morning I resolved to harbour
what I had got in my new cave, and not carry it home to my
castle. After refreshing myself, I got all my cargo on shore, and
began to examine the particulars. The cask of liquor I found
to be a kind of rum, but not such as we had at the Brazils, and,
in a word, not at all good; but when I came to open the chests,
I found several things of great use to me: for example, I found
I48 Anvsm'uass or
I48 Anvsm'uass or
three pints each, and were tipped with silver. I found two pots
of very good succades or sweetmeats, so fastened also on the
top, that. the salt water had not hurt them; and two more of the
same, which the water had spoiled. I found some very good
shirts, which were very welcome to me; and about a dozen and
a half of white linen handkerchiefs and coloured neckcloths; the
former were also very welcome, being exceeding refreshing to
wipe my face in a hot day. Besides this, when I came to the
till in the chest, I found there three great bags of pieces-of eight,
which held about eleven hundred pieces in all; and in one
'pf them, wrapped up in a paper, six doubloons of gold and some
small bars or wedges of gold; I suppose they might all weigh
sear a pound. _In the other chests were some clothes, bu
of little value; but, by the circumstances, it must have belonged

the whole, I got very little by this voyage that was of any use
to me: for, as to the money, I had no manner of occasion for it;
it was to me as the dirt under my feet; and I would have given
it all for three or four pair of English shoes and stockings, which
were things I greatl wanted, but had none on my feet for many
years. I had indeed got two pair of shoes now, which I took
off the feet of the two drowned men whom I saw in the wreck,
and I found two pair more in one of the chests, which were very
welcome to me; but they were not like our English shoes, either
for ease or service, being rather what we call pumps than shoes.

but no gold : I suppose this belonged to a poorer man than the

escape to England, it might lie here safe enough till I may come

Having now brought all my things on shore, and secured them,
I went back to my boat, and rowed or paddled her along the shore,
to her old harbour, where I laid her up, and made the best of my
way to my old habitation, where I found every thing safe and
quiet. I began now to repose myself, live after my old fashion,
and take care of my family affairs; and, for a while, I lived
easy enough, only that I was more vigilant than I used to
be, looked out oftener, and did not go abroad so much ; and

his spirits, he is kept serene and calm, by having the events
of things bid from his eyes, and knowing nothing of the dangers
which surround him.
After these thoughts had for some time entertained me, I came
nosmson causes. 16!
many years in this very island, and how I had walked about in
the greatest security, and with all possible tranquillity, even
when perhaps nothing but the brow of a hill, a great tree, or
the casual approach of night, had been between me and the
worst kind of destruction, viz. that of falling into the hands of
cannibals and savages, who would have seized on me with the
same view as I would on a goat or a turtle, and have thought
it no more a crime to kill and devour me, than I did a pigeon
or curlew. I would unjustly slander myself, if I should say I
was not sincerely thankful to my great Preserver, to whose
singular protection I acknowledged, with great humility, all
these unknown deliverances were due, and without which I must
inevitably have fallen into their merciless hands
When these thoughts were over, my head was for some time
taken up in considering the nature of these wretched creatures,
I mean the savages, and how it came to pass in the world, that
the wise Governor of all things should give up any of his crea-
tures to such inhumanity, nay, to something so much below
even brutality itself, as to devour its own kind; but as this
ended in some (at that time) fruitless speculations, it occurred
to me to inquire what part of the world these wretches lived
in? how far off the coast was from whence they came? what
they ventured over so far from home for? what kind of boats
they had? and why I might not order myself and my businesi
so, that I might be as able to go over thither as they were to
come to me. -
I never so much as troubled myself to consider what I should
do With myself when I went thither, what would become of me,
if I fell into the hands of the savages; or how I should escape
from them, if they attacked me: no, nor so much as how it was
possible for me to reach the coast, and not be attacked by some
or other of them, without any possibility of delivering myself;
and if I should not fall into their hands, what I should do for
provision, or whither I should bend my course: none of these
thoughts, I say, so much as came in my way; but my mind was
wholly bent u on the notion of my passing over in my boat to
the main lan I looked upon my present condition as the
most miserable that could possibly be; that I was not able to
throw myself into any thing, but death, that could be called
worse; and if I reached the shore of the main, I might perhaps
meet with relief, or I might coast along, as I did on the African
shore, till I came to some inhabited country, and where I might '
152 Lovemars or
some Christian ship that might take me in; and if the worst
came to the worst, I could but die, which would put an end to
all these miseries at once. Pray note, all this was the fruit of a
disturbed mind, an impatient temper, made desperate, as it
were, by the long continuance of my troubles, and the disap-
pointments I had met in the wreck I had been on board of, and
where I had been so near obtaining what I so earnestly longed
for, viz. somebody to speak to, and to learn some knowledge
from- them of the place where I was, and of the probable means
of my deliverance. I was agitated wholly by these thoughts;
all my calm of mind, in my resignation to Providence, and
waiting the issue of the dispositions of Heaven, seemed to be
suspended; and I had, as it were, no power to turn my thoughts
to any thing but to the project of a voyage to the main, which
came upon me with such force, and such an impetuosity of
desire, that it was not to be resisted.
When this had agitated my thoughts for two hours or more,
with such violence that it set my very blood into a ferment,
and my pulse beat as if I had been in a fever, merely with the
extraordinary fervour of my mind about it, nature, as if I had
been fatigued and exhausted with the very thought of it, threw
me into a sound sleep. One would have thought I should
have dreamed of it, but I did not, nor of anything relating to
it: but I dreamed that as I was going out in the morning, as
usual, from my castle, I saw upon the shore two canoes and
eleven savages coming to land, and that they brought with them
another savage, whom they were going to kill, in order to eat
him; when, on a sudden, the savage that they were going to
kill jumped away. and ran for his life; and I thought, in my
sleep, that he came running into my little thick grove before my
nosmsou cnvsos. 153
not perceiving that the others sought him that way, showed
myself to him, and smiling upon him, encouraged him: that he
kneeled down to me, seeming to pray me to assist him; upon
which I showed him my ladder, made him go up, and carried
him into my cave, and he became my servant: and that as soon
as I had got this man, I said to myself, Now I may certainly
venture to the main land; for this fellow will serve me as a
pilot, and will tell me what to do, and whither to go for pro-
visions, and whither not to go for fear of being devoured; what
places to venture into, and what to shun. I waked with this
thought; and was under such inexpressible impressions of joy
at the prospect of my escape in my dream, that the disappoint-
nosmsou cnvsos. 153
was no more than a ream, were equally extravagant the other
way, and threw me into a very great dejection of s irits.
Upon this, however, I made this conclusion: t at my only
way to go about to attempt an escape was, if possible, to get a
savage into my possession; and, if possible, it should be one of
their prisoners whom they had condemned to be eaten, and
should bring hither to kill. But these thoughts still were
nosmsou cnvsos. 153
without attacking a whole caravan of them, and killing them
all: and this was not only a very desperate attempt, and might
miscarry: but, on the other hand, I had greatly scrupled the
lawfulness of it to m self, and my heart trembled at the thought
of shedding so muc blood, though it was for my deliverance.
I need not repeat the arguments which occurred to me against
this, they being the same mentioned before: but though I had
other reasons to offer now, viz. that those men were enemies to
my life, and would devour me if they could; that it was self-
preservation, in the highest degree, to deliver myself from this
death of a life, and was acting in my own defence as much as if
they were actually assaulting me, and the like; I say, though
these things argued for it, yet the thoughts of shedding human
blood for my deliverance were very terrible to me, and such as
I could by no means reconcile myself to for a great while.
However, at last, after many secret disputes with myself, and
after great perplexities about it (for all these arguments, one
way and another, struggled in my head a long time), the eager
prevailing desire of deliverance at length mastered all the rest;
and I resolved, if possible, to get one of those savages into my
hands, cost what it would. My next thing was to contrive how
nosmsou cnvsos. 153
I could pitch upon no probable means for it, so I resolved to I
put myself upon the watch, to see them when they came :11
154 uvxnroaas or
shore, and leave the rest to the event, taking such measures as
the opportunity should present, let what would be.
With these resolutions in my thoughts, I set myself upon the
scout as often as possible, and indeed so often, that I was heartily
tired of it; for it was above a year and a half that I waited;
and for great part of that time went out to the west end, and
to the south-west corner, of the island, almost every day, to
look for canoes, but none appeared. This was very discouraging,
and began to trouble me much, though I cannot say that it did
in this case (as it had done some time before) wear off the edge
of my desire to the thing; but the longer it seemed to be de-
154 uvxnroaas or
so careful to shun the sight of these savages, and avoid being
seen by them, as l was now eager to be upon them. Besides,
I fancied myself able to manage one, nay, two or three savages,
if I had them, SO as to make them entirely slaves to me, to do
whatever I should direct them, and to prevent their being able
at any time to do me any hurt. It was a great while that l
154 uvxnroaas or
'my fancies and schemes came to nothing, for no savages came
near me for a great while.




SLU'l'lON XXII.
BOBINSON RESCUES ONE OF THEIR CAPTIVES FROM THE SAVAGES,
WHOM HE NAMES FRIDAY, AND MAKES HIS SERVANT.
ABOUT a. year and a half after I entertained these notions (and
by long musing had, as it were, resolved them all into nothing,
for want of an occasion to put them into execution), I was sur-
nonmsos (mu-son. 155
all on shore together on my side the island, and the people who
belonged to them all landed, and out of my sight. The number
of them broke all, my measures ; for seeing so many, and know-
ing that they always came four or six, or sometimes more, in a
boat, I could not tell what to think of it, or how to take my
measures, to attack twenty or thirty men single-handed; so lay
still in my castle, perplexed and discomforted: however, I put
myself into all the same postures for an attack that I hadfor-
merly provided, and was just ready for action, if anything had
presented. Having waited a good while, listening to hear if
they made any noise, at length, being very impatient, I set my
guns at the foot of my ladder, and clambered up to the top of
the hill, by my two stages, as usual; standing so, however, that
my head did not appear above the hill, so that they could not
perceive me by any means. Here I observed, by the help of
my perspective glass, that they were no less than thirty-in
nonmsos (mu-son. 155
dressed. How they had cooked it I knew not, or what it was ;
but they were all dancing, in I know not how many lat-batons
nonmsos (mu-son. 155

While I was thus looking on them, I perceived, by my pen-
sp active, two miserable wretches dragged from the boats, where,
it seems, they were laid by. and were now brought out for the
slaughter. I perceived one of them immediately fall, being
knocked down, I suppose, with a club or wooden sword, for
that was their way, and two or three others were at work im-
mediately, cutting him open for their cookery, while the other
victim was left standing by himself, till they should be ready for
him. In that very moment, this poor wretch seeing himself a
little at liberty, and unbound, nature inspired him with hopes of
life, and he started away from them, and ran with incredible
swiftness along the sands, directly towards me, I mean towards
that part of the coast where my habitation was. I was dread-
fully frightened, I must acknowledge, when I perceived him run
my way, and especially when, as I thought, I saw him pursued
by the whole body: and now I expected that part of my dream
was coming to pass, and that he would certainly take shelter in
my grove; but I could not depend, by any means, upon my
dream for the rest of it, viz. that the other savages would not

was not above three men that followed him; and still more was
I encouraged when I found that he outstripped them exceedingly
in running, and gained ground of them, so that if he could but
hold it for half an hour, I saw easily he would fairly get away
from them all.
There was between them and my castle the creek, which I

my cargoes out of the ship ; and this I saw plainly he must ne-
cessarily swim over, or the poor wretch would be taken there:
but when the savage escaping came thither, he made nothing of
it, though the tide was then up; but plunging in, swam through
in about thirty strokes, or thereabouts, landed, and ran on with
£56 ‘ anvarmmns or
came to the creek, I found that two of them could swim, but the
third could not, and that, standing on the other side, he looked
at the others, but went no farther, and soon after went softly
back again; which, as it happened, was very well for him in the
end. I observed, that the two who swam were yet more than
twice as long swimming over the creek as the fellow was that
£56 ‘ anvarmmns or
and indeed irresistibly, that now was the time to get me a ser-
vant, and perhaps a companion or assistant, and that I was
called plainly by Providence to save this poor creature's life.
I immediately ran down the ladders with all possible expedition,
fetched my two guns, for they were both at the foot of the lad-
ders, as I observed above, and getting u again, with the name
haste, to the top of the hill, I crossed, toward the sea, and
having a very short cut, and all downhill, placed myself in the
way between the pursuers and the pursued, hallooing aloud to

him to come back; and, in the meantime, I slowly advanced to-

though, at that distance, it would not have been easily heard,
and being out of sight of the smoke too, they would not have
easily known what to make of it. Having knocked this fellow
down, the other who pursued him stopped, as if he had been
frightened, and I advanced apace towards him: but as I came
nearer, I perceived presently he had a bow and arrow, and was

stood, and came a little way; then stopped again, and then a
little farther, and stopped again; and I could then perceive that
he stood trembling, as if he had been taken prisoner, and had
Elsi: been to be killed, as his two enemies were. I beckoned to
' again to come to me, and gave him all the signs of encourage-
ment that I could think of; and he came nearer and nearer,
kneeling down every ten or twelve steps, in token of acknow-
ledgment for saving his life. I smiled at him, and looked plea-
santly, and beckoned to him to come still nearer: at length he
came close to me; and then he kneeled down again, kissed the
ground, and laid his head upon the ground, and taking me by
the foot, set my foot upon his head: this, it seems, was in token
of swearing to be my slave for ever. I took him up, and made
much of him, and encouraged him all I could. But there was
more work to do yet; for I perceived the savage whom I
knocked down was not killed but stunned with the blow, and
began to come to himself: so I pointed to him, and showed him
the savage, that he was not dead: upon this he spoke some
words to me, and though I could not understand them, yet

himself so far as to sit up upon the ground, andI perceived that
my savage began to be afraid; but when I saw that,l presented
my other piece at the man, as if I would shoot him: upon this
I 2
my savage, for so I call him now, made a motion to me to lend
him my sword which hung naked ina belt by my side, which
I did. He no sooner had it, but he runs to his enemy, and, at
one blow, cut off his head so cleverly, no executioner in Ger-
many could have done it sooner or better; which I thought
very strange for one who, I had reason to believe, never saw a
sword in his life before, except their own wooden swords: how-
ever, it seems, as I learned afterwards, they make their wooden
swords so sharp, so heavy, and the wood is so hard, that they
will cut off heads even with them, a and arms, and that at one
blow too. When he had done this, e comes laughing to me, in
sign of triumph, and brought me the sword again, and with
abundance of gestures, which I did not understand, laid it down,
with the head of the savage that he had killed, just before me.
But that which astonished him most was to know how I killed
the other Indian so far off: so pointing to him, he made signs
to me to let him go to him ; so I bade him go, as well as I could.
When he came to him, he stood like one amazed, looking at
158 mvnsrnars or
the wound the bullet had made, which, it seems, was just in his
breast where it had made a hole, and no great quantity of blood
had followed, but he had bled inwardly, for he was quite dead.
He took up his bow and arrows, and came back ; so I turned to
go away, and beckoned him to follow me, making signs to him
that more might come after them. Upon this, he made signs to
me that he should bury them with sand, that they might not be
seen by the rest, if they followed; and so I made signs to him
again to do so. He fell to work; and, in an instant, he had
scraped a hole in the sand with his hands, big enough to bury
158 mvnsrnars or
did so by the other also : I believe he had buried them both in
a quarter of an hour. Then calling him away, I carried him,
not to my castle, but quite away, to my cave, on the farther
part of the island: so I did not let my dream come to pass in
that part, viz. that he came into my grove for shelter. Here
I gave him bread and a bunch of raisins to eat, and a draught of
water, which I found he was indeed in great distress for, by his
running; and having refreshed him, I made signs for him to go
and lie down to sleep, showing him a place where Ihad laid
some rice straw, and a blanket upon it, which I used to sleep
upon myself sometimes,‘so the poor creature lay down, and
went to sleep.
He was a comely, handsome fellow, perfectly well made, with
straight, strong limbs, not too large, tall, and well-shaped, and,
as I reckon, about twenty-six years of age. He had a very

aspeciaily when he smiled. His hair was long and black, not
curled like wool; his forehead very high and large; and a great
vivacity and sparkling sharpness in his eyes. The colour of his
skin was not quite black, but very tawny; and yet not an ugly,
yellow, nauseous tawny, as the Brazilians and Virginians, and
other natives of America are, but of abright kind of a dun olive-
colour, that had in it something very agreeable, though not very
easy to describe. His face was round and plump ; his nose

After he had slumbered, rather than slept, about half an hour
he awoke again, and came out of the cave to me, for I had been
milking my goats, which I had in the enclosure just by: when he
espied me, he came running to me, laying himself down again
upon the ground, with all the possible signs of an humble, thank-
ful disposition, making a great many antic gestures to show it.

and sets my other foot upon his head, as he had done before; and
after this made all the signs to me of subjection, servitude, and
submission imaginable, to let me know how he would serve me
as long as he lived. I understood him in many things, and let
him know I was very well pleased with him. In a little. time I

I let him know his name should be FRIDAY, which was the day
I saved his life: I called him so for the memory of the time. I
likewise taught him to say Master: and then let him know that
was to be my name: I likewise taught him to say Yes and N0,
and to know the meaning of them. I gave him some milk in an
earthen pot, and let him see me drink it before him, and sop my
bread in it; and gave him a cake of bread to do the like, which
he quickly complied with, and made signs that it was very good
for him. I kept there with him all that night; but as soon as
it was day, I beckoned to him to come with me, and let him know
I would give him some clothes: at which he seemed very glad,
for he was stark naked. As we went by the place where he had
buried the two men, he pointed exactly to the place, and showed
nonmsos causor. 159
to me that we should dig them up again, and eat them. At this I
appeared very angry, expressed my abhorrenne of it, made as if
I would vomit at the thoughts of it, and beckoned with my hand
to him to come away, which he did immediately, with great sub-
mission. I then led him up to the top of the hill, to see if his
enemies were gone; and pulling out my glass, I looked, and saw
plainly the place where they had been, but no appearance of them
or their canoes: so that it was plain that they were gone, and
had left their two comrades behind them, without any search
after them.
But I was not content with this discovery; but having now
£00 AlWsxronrs or
more courage, and consequently more cr'riosity, I took my man
Friday with me, giving him the sword in his hand, with the bow
and arrows at his back, which I found he could use very dexter-
ously, making him carry one gun for me, and I two for myself;
and away we marched to the place where these creatures had
been, for I had a mind now to get some fuller intelligence of them.
When I came to the place, my very blood ran chill in my veins,
and my heart sunk within me, at the horror of the spectacle:
indeed, it was a dreadful sight, at least it was so to me, though
Friday made nothing of it. The place was covered with human
£00 AlWsxronrs or
left here and there, half-eaten, mangled, and scorched; and, in
short, all the tokens of the triumphant feast they had been
making there, after a victory over their enemies. I saw three
£00 AlWsxronrs or
and abundance of other parts of the bodies; and Friday, by his
signs, made me understand that they brought over four prisoners
to feast upon; that three of them were eaten up, and that he,
ointing to himself, was the fourth; that there had been a great
attle between them and their next king, whose subjects, it seems,
he had been one of, and that they had taken a great number of
prisoners; all which were carried to several places by those who

£00 AlWsxronrs or
whatever remained, and lay them together in a heap, and make
£00 AlWsxronrs or
£00 AlWsxronrs or
still a cannibal in his nature; but I discovered so much abhor-
rence, at the very thoughts of it, and at the least appearance of
it, that he durst not discover it: for I had, by some means, let
him know that I would kill him if he offered it.
When he had done this, we came back to our castle; and there
£00 AlWsxronrs or
pair of linen drawers, which I had out of the poor gunner's chest
I mentioned which I found in the wreck; and which, with a
£00 AlWsxronrs or
jerkin of goat’s skin, as well as my skill would allow (for I was
now grown a tolerable good tailor); and I gave him a cap, which
I made of hare’s skin, very convenient and fashionable enough;
and thus he was clothed for the present. tolerably well, and was
mighty well pleased to see himself almost as well clothed as
his master. It is true, he went awkwardly in those clothes at

they hurt him, and using himself to them, he took to them at

The next day after I came home to my hutch with him, I began
to consider where I should lodge him; and that I might do well
for him, and yet be perfectly easy myself, I made a little tent for

door or entrance there into my cave, I made a formal framed
decrease, and a door to it of boards, and set it up in the passage,
a little within the entrance; and causing the door to open in the
inside, I barred it up in the night, taking in my ladders too; so
that Friday could no way come at me in the inside of my inner-
most wall, without making so much noise in getting over that it

roof over it of long poles, covering all my tent, and leaning up to
the side of the hill; whichwas again laid across with smaller sticks,
instead of laths, and then thatched over a great thickness with the
rice-straw, which was strong, like reeds; and at the hole or place
which was left to go in or out b the ladder, I had placed a kind
of trap door, which, if it had been attempted on the outside.
would not have opened at all, but would have fallen down, and
made a great noise: as to weapons, I took them all into my
side every night. But I needed none of all this precaution; for
never man had a more faithful, loving, sincere servant than Friday
was to me; without passions, sullenness, or designs, perfectly
obliged and engaged—his very affections were tied to me, like
those of a child to a father; and I dare say, he would have sacri-
nonmson causoa. 161
the many testimonies he gave me of this put it out of doubt, and
soon convinced me that I needed to use no precautions, as to my
safety on his account.
This frequently gave me occasion to observe, and that with
wonder, that however it had pleased God, in his providence, and
in the government of the works of his hands, to take from so
great a part of the world of his creatures the best uses to which
their faculties and the powers of their souls are adapted, yet that
he has bestowed upon them the same powers, the same reason,
the same affections, the same sentiments of kindness and obli-
gation, the same passions and resentments of wrongs, the same

doing good, and receiving good, that he has given to us; and that
when he pleases to offer them occasions of exerting these, they
are as ready, nay, more read , to apply them to the right uses
for which they were bestowe , than we are. This made me very
nonmson causoa. 161
sented, how mean a use we make of all these, even though we
have these powers enlightened by the great lamp of instruction,
the Spirit of God, and by the knowledge of his word added to our
understanding; and why it has pleased God to hide the like saving
knowledge from so many millions of souls, who, if I might judge
by this poor savage, would make a much better use of it than we
did. From hence, I sometimes was led too far, to invade the
sovereignty of Providence, and as it were arraign the justice of
so arbitrary a disposition of things, that should hide that light
from some, and reveal it to others, and yet expect a like duty
from both; but I shut it up, and checked my thoughts with this
16? ADVENTURES 0!
these should be condemned: but that as God was necessarily, and,
16? ADVENTURES 0!
be, but if these creatures were all sentenced to absence from him-
self, it was on account of sinning against that light, which, as the
Scripture says, was a law to themselves, and by such rules as
their consciences would acknowledge to be just, though the
foundation was not discovered to us; and, secondly, That still,
as we all are the clay in the hand of the potter, no vessel could
say to him, Why hast thou formed me thus?
But to return to my new companion :—I was greatly delighted
with him, and made it my business to teach him everything that
was proper to make him useful, handy, and helpful; but especially
to make him speak, and understand me when I spoke: and he
was the aptest scholar that ever was; and particularly was so
merry, so constantly diligent, and so pleased when he could but
understand me, or make me understand him, that it was very
pleasant to me to talk to him. Now my life began to be so easy,

from more savages, I cared not if I was never to remove from the
place where I lived.

morning to the woods. I went, indeed, intending to kill a. kid out

going, I saw a shegoat lying down in the shade, and two young
kids sitting by her. I catched hold of Friday ;—Hold, said I;
stand still; and made signs to him not to stir: immediately I
presented my piece, shot, and killed one of the kids. The poor
creature, who had, at a distance, indeed, seen me kill the savage,
his enemy, but did not know, nor could imagine, how it was
done, was sensibly surprised, trembled and shook, and looked
so amazcd, that I thought he would have sunk down. He did
not see the kid I shot at, or perceive I had killed it, but ripped
up his waistcoat, to feel whether he was not wounded, and, as I
found presently, thougntI was resolved to kill him: for he came
and kneeled down to me, and embracing my knees, said a great
many things I did not understand; but I could easily see the
meaning was, to pray me not to kill him.
I soon found a way to convince him that I would do him no
harm; and taking him up by the hand, laughed at him, and
pointing to the kid which I had killed, beckoned to him to run
and fetch it, which he did; and while he was wandering, and
looking to see how the creature was killed, I loaded my gun again.
By and by, I saw a great fowl, like a hawk, sitting upon a tree,
within shot ; so, to let Friday understand a little what I would
do, I called him to me again, pointed at the fowl, which was
indeed a par rot, though I thought it had been a hawk; I say
pointing to the parrot, and to my gun, and to the ground under
the parrot, to let him see I would make it fall, I made him
understand that I would shoot and kill that bird: accordingly, I

He stood like one frightened again, notwithstanding all I had
said to him; and I found he was the more amazed, because he
did not see me put any thing into the gun, but thought that
there must be some wonderful fund of death and destruction in
that thing, ableto kill man, beast, or bird, or any thing near or
far off; and the astonishment this created in him was such, as
could not wear off for a long time ; and I believe, if I would have
let him, he would have worshipped me and my gun. As for the
gun itself, he would not so much as touch it for several days
after; but he would speak to it, and talk to it, as if it had an-
swered him, when he was by himself; which, as I afterwards
learned of him, was to desire it not to kill him. Well, after his
astonishment was a little over at this, I pointed to him to run
and fetch the bird I had shot, which he did, but stayed some

' good distance from the place where she fell: however, he found
her, took her up, and brought her to me; and as I had perceived
his ignorance about the gun before,I took this advantage to
charge the gun again, and not to let him see me do it, that I
might be ready for any other mark that might present; but no-
thing more offered at that time: so I brought home the kid, and
the same evening I took the skin off, and cut it out as well as I

begun to eat some, I gave some to my man, who seemed very
glad of it, and liked it very well: but that which was strangest
to him, was to see me eat salt with it. He made a sign to me
that the salt was not good to eat; and putting a little into his
mouth, he seemed to nauseate it, and would spit and sputter at
it, washing his mouth with fresh water after it: on the other
hand, I took some meat into my month without salt, and I pre-
tended to spit and sputter for want of salt, as fast as he had done
at the salt; but it would not do; he would never care for salt
with his meat or in his broth; at least, not for a great while, and
then but very little.
Having thus fed him with boiled meat and broth, Iwas resolved
to feast him the next da with roasting a piece of the kid : this

to hear.
The next day I set him to work to beating some corn out, and
sifting it in the manner I used to do, as I observed before; and
he soon understood how to do it as well as I, especially after he
had seen what the meaning of it Was, and that it was to make
bread of it : for after that I let him see me make my bread, and
bake it too; and in a little time Friday was able to do all the
work for me, as well as I could do it myself.
I began now to consider, that having two mouths to feed instead
of one, I must provide more ground for my harvest, and plant a
larger quantity of corn than I used to do: so I marked out a
larger piece of land, and began the fence in the same manner as
before, in which Friday worked not only very willingly and very
hard, but did it very cheerfully: and I told him what it was for;
that it was for corn to make more bread, because he was now
with me, and that I might have enough for him and myself too.
He appeared very sensible of that part, and let me know that
he thought I had much more labour upon me on his account
than I had for myself; and that he would work the harder for me,
if I would tell him what to do.
This was the pleasantest year of all the life I led in this place.
Friday began to talk pretty well, and understand the names
of almost every thing I had occasion to call for, and of every
place 1 had to send him to, and talked a great deal to me; so
that, in short, I began now to have some use for my tongue again,
which, indeed, I had very little occasion for before, that is to say,
about speech. Besides the pleasure of talking to him, I had a
singular satisfaction in the fellow himself: his simple, nnfeigned
honesty appeared to me more and more every day, and I began
really to love the creature; and, on his Side,- I believe he loved
me more than it was possible for him ever to love any thing
before.
I had a mind once to try if he had any hankering inclination
to his own country again; and having taught him English so
well that he could answer me almost any question, I asked him
whether the nation that he belonged to never conquered in bat-

taken prisoner then, Friday?
FRIDAY. My nation beat much, for all that.
MASTER. How beat? If your nation beat them, how came you

FRIDAY- They more many than my nation in the place when
me was; they take one, twc, three, and me ; my nation overheat
them in the yonder place, where me no was; there my nation
take one, two, great thousand.
MASTER. But why did not your side recover you from the
hands of your enemies, then!
FRIDAY. They run one, two, three, and me, and make go in
the canoe; my nation have no canoe that time.
MASTER. Well, Friday, and what does your nation do With
the men they take? Do they carry them away and eat them, as
these did?
FRIDAY. Yes, my nation eat mans too; eat all up.
MASTER. Where do they carry them?
FRIDAY. Go to other place, where they think.
MASTER. Do they come hither?
FRIDAY. Yes, yes, they come hither; come other else place.
MASTER. Have you been here with them?
FRIDAY. Yes, I have been here; (points to the N. w. side of the
island, which, it seems, was their side.)
By this I understood that my man Friday had formerly been
among the savages who used to come on shore on the farther
part of the island, on the same man-eating occasions he was
now brought for : and some time after, when I took the courage
to carry him to that side, being the same I formerly mentioned,
he presently knew the place, and told me he was there once
when they eat up twenty men, two women, and one child: he
could not tell twenty in English, but he numbered them, by
laying so many stones in a row, and pointing to me to tell them
over.
I have told this passage, because it introduces what follows ;
that after I had this discourse with him, I asked him how far it
was from our island to the shore, and whether the canoes were
not often lost. He told me there was no danger, no canoes ever
lost; but that, after a little way out to sea, there was a current
and wind, always one way in the morning, the other in the after-
noon. This I understood to be no more than the sets of the tide,
as going out or coming in; but I afterwards understood it was
166 anvamnns on
Oroonoko, in 'the mouth or gulf of which river, as I foun after-
wards, our island lay; and that this land which I perceived to
the W. and N. W. was the great island Trinidad, on the north point
of the mouth of the river. I asked Friday a thousand questions
about the country, the inhabitants, the sea, the coast, and what
nations were near: he told me all he knew, with the greatest
openness imaginable. I asked him the names of the several
nations of his sort of people, but could get no other name than
Caribs: from whence I easily understood, that these were the
Caribbees, which our maps place on the part of America which
reaches from the mouth of the river Oroonoko to Guiana, and
A
onwards to St. Martha. He told me that u a great way beyond
the moon, that was, beyond the setting of t e moon. which must
be west from their country, there dwelt white bearded men, like
me, and pointed to my great whiskers, which I mentioned before;
and that they had killed much mans, that was his word : by all
which I understood, he meant the Spaniards, whose cruelties in
America had been spread over the whole country, and were re-
membered by all the nations, from father to son.
I inquired if he could tell me how I might go from this island
and get among those white men: he told me, Yes, yes, you may
go in two canoe. I could not understand what he meant, or ‘
make him describe to me what he meant by two canoe ; till, at

began to relish with me very we ‘.; and from this time I enter-

portunity to make my escape from this place, and that this poor
savage might be a means to help me.
During the long time that Friday had now been with me, and
that he began to speak to me, and understand me, I was not
wanting to lay a foundation of religious knowledge in his mind:
particularly I asked him, one time, who made him? The poor
creature did not understand me at all, but thought I had asked
him who was his father; but I took it up by another handle,
and asked him who made the sea, the ground we walked on, and
the hills and woods? He told me, it was one old Benamuckee,
that lived beyond all; he could describe nothing of this great
person, but that he was very old, much older, he said, than the
sea or the land, than the moon or the stars. I asked him then,
if this old person had made all things, why did not all things
worship him? He looked very grave, and with a perfect look
of innocence said, All things say 0 to him. I asked him if the
people who die in his country went away any where? He said,
'es; they all went to Benamuckee: then I asked him whether
these they ate up went thither too? He said, Yes.
From these things I began to instruct him in the knowledge
of the true God: I told him that the great Maker of all things
lived up there, pointing up towards heaven; that be governed
the world by the same power and providence by which he made
it; that he was omnipotent, and could do every thing for us,
've everything to us, take every thing from us ; and thus, by
egress, I opened his eyes. He listened with great attention,
and received with pleasure the notion of Jesus Christ being sent
to redeem us, and of the manner of making our prayers to God,
and his being able to hear us, even in heaven. He told me one
day, that if our God could hear us up beyond the sun, he must
needs be a greater God than their Benamuckee ,who lived but a
little way 03, and yet could not hear till they went up to the
great mountains where he dwelt to speak to him I asked him
if ever he went thither to speak to him'! He said, No; they
never went that were young men: none went thither but the
old men, whom he called their Oowokakee; that is, as I made
him explain it to me, their religious, or clergy; and that they
went to say 0 (so he called saying prayers), and then came
back, and told them what Benamuckee said. By this I ob-
served, that there is priestcraft even among the most blinded,
ignorant pagans in the world; and the policy of makinga secret
of religion, in order to preserve the veneration of the people to
the clergy, is not only to be found in the Roman, but perhaps
among all religions in the world, even among the most brutish
and barbarous savages.
I endeavoured to clear up this fraud to my man Friday; and
told him, that the pretence of their old men going up to the
mountains to say 0 to their god Benamuckee was a cheat; and
their bringing word from thence what he said was much more
so; that if they met with any answer, or spake with any one
there, it must be with an evil spirit; and then I entered into a.
long discourse with him about the devil, the original of him, his
rebellion against God, his enmity to man, the reason of it, his
setting himself up in the dark parts of the world to be wor-
shipped instead of God, and as God, and the many stratagems
he made use of to delude mankind to their ruin; how he had a.
secret access to our passions and to our affections, and to adapt
his snares to our inclinations, so as to cause us even to be our
own tempters, and run upon our destruction by our own choice.
I found it was not so easy to imprint right notions in his mind
about the devil, as it was about the being of a God : nature as-
sisted all my arguments to evidence to him even the necessity of
a great First Cause, and overruling, governing Power, a secret,
directing Providence, and of the equity and justice of paying
homage to him that made us, and the like; but there appeared
nothing of this kind in the notion of an evil spirit; of his ori-
ginal, his being, his nature, and, above all, of his inclination to
do evil, and to draw us in to do so too: and the poor creature
puzzled me once in such a manner, by a question merely natural
and innocent, that I scarce knew what to say to him. I had
been talking a great deal to him of the power of God, his om-
I68 ADVENTURES or
workers of iniquity; how, as he had made us all, he could
destroy us and all the world in a moment; and he listened with
great seriousness to me all the while. After this, I had been
telling him how the devil was God’s enemy in the hearts of men,
and used all his malice and skill to defeat the good designs of
Providence, and to ruin the kingdom of Christ in the world, and
the like: Well, says Friday, but you say God is so strong, so
great; Is he not much strong, much might as the devil T—Yes,
yes. says I. Friday, God is stronger than the devil: God is
above the devil, and therefore we pray to God to tread him
down under our feet, and enable us to resist his temptations,

stronger, much might as the devil, why God no kill the devil, so
make him no more do wicked? I was strangely surprised at
this question; and, after all, though I was now an old man, yet

aonmson cnosos. me
so I pretended not to hear him, and asked him what he said; but
he was too earnest for an answer, to forget his question, so that
he repeated it in the very same broken words as above. By
this time I had recovered myself a little, and I said, God will at
last unish him severely; he is reserved for the judgment, and
is to e cast into the bottomless pit, to dwell with everlasting

peating my words, Reserve at last : me no understand; but why

repent and be pardoned. He mused some time on this. Well,
well, says he, mighty affectionately, that well: so you, I, devil,
all wicked, all preserve, repent, God pardon all. Here I was
run down again by him to the last degree; and it was a testi-
mony to me, how the mere notions of nature, though the will
guide reasonable creatures to the knowledge of a God, an of a
worship or homage due to the supreme being of God, as the
consequence of our nature, yet nothing but divine revelation can
form the knowledge of Jesus Christ, and of redemption pur-
chased for us, of a Mediator of the new covenant, and of an In-
tercessor at the footstool of God's throne : I say, nothing but a
revelation from Heaven can form these in the soul; and that,
therefore, the gospel of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ,
I mean the Word of God, and the Spirit of God, promised for
aonmson cnosos. me
sary instructors of the souls of men in the saving knowledge of
God, and the means of salvation.
I therefore diverted the present discourse between me and my
man, rising up hastily, as upon some sudden occasion of going
out: then sending him for something a good way off, I seriously
prayed to God that he would enable me to instruct savingly this
poor savage; assisting, by his Spirit, the heart of the poor igno-
rant creature to receive the light of the knowledge of God in
Christ, reconciling him to himself, and would guide me to speak
'0 to him from the word of God, as his conscience might be con-
vinced, his eyes opened, and his soul saved. When he came
again to me, I entered into a long discourse with him upon the
subject of the redemption of man by the Saviour of the world,
and of the doctrine of the gospel preached from heaven, viz. of
repentance towards God, and faith in our blessed Lord Jesus.
I then explained to him, as well as I could, wl: y our blessed
Redeemer took not on him the nature of angels, but the seed of
Abraham; and how, for that reason, the fallen angels had no
share in the redemption; that he came only to the lost sheep of
the house of Israel, and the like.
I had, God knows, more sincerity than knowledge in all the
methods I took for this poor creature’s instruction, and must
acknowledge, what I believe all that act upon the same principle
1'0 ADVENTURES or
and instructed myself in many things that either I did not know,
or had not fully considered before, but which occurred naturally
to my mind upon searching into them, for the information of
this poor savage; and I had more affection in my inquiry after
things upon this occasion than ever I felt before : so that,
whether this poor wild wretch was the better for me or no, I had
great reason to be thankful that ever he came to me; my grief
sat lighter upon me ; my habitation grew comfortable to me be-

up to Heaven myself, and to seek to the hand that had brought
me here, but was now to be made an instrument, under Pro-
vidence, to save the life, and, for aught I knew, the soul, of a
poor savage, and bring him to the true knowledge of religion,
and of the Christian doctrine, that he might know Christ Jesus,
1'0 ADVENTURES or
things, a secret joy ran through every part of my soul, and
I frequently rejoiced that ever I was brought to this place, which
1'0 ADVENTURES or
could possibly have befallen me.
I continued in this thankful frame all the remainder of my time;
and the conversation which employed the hours between Friday
and me was such, as made the three years which we lived there
together perfectly and completely happy, if any such thing as
complete happiness can be formed in a sublunary state. This
savage was now a good Christian, a, much better than I ; though
I have reason to hope, and bless God for it, that we were equally
penitent, and comforted, restored penitents. We had here the
1'0 ADVENTURES or
than if we had been in England. I always applied myself, in
reading the Scriptures, to let him know, as well as I could, the
meaning of what I read; and he again. by his serious inquiries
and questionings, made me, as I said before, a much better
scholar in the Scripture-knowledge than I should ever have been
_ by my own mere private reading. Another thing I cannot refrain
from observing here also, from experience in this retired part of
1'0 ADVENTURES or
the knowledge of God, and of the doctrine of salvation by Christ
Jesus, is so plainly laid down in the word of God, so easy to be
received and understood, that, as the bare reading the Scripture
made me capable of understanding enough of my duty to carry
me directly on to the great work of sincere re entance for my
sins, and laying hold of a. Saviour for life an salvation, to a
stated reformation in practice, and obedience to all God‘s com-
mands, and this without any teacher or instructor, I mean human;

ing this savage creature, and bringing him to be such a Christian,
as I have known few equal to him in my life.
As to all the disputes, wrangling, strife, and contention, which
have happened in the world about religion, whether niceties in
doctrines, or schemes of church government, they were all per-
fectly useless to us, and for aught I can yet see, they have been
so to the rest of the world. We had the sure guide to heaven,
viz. the word of God; and we had, blessed be God, comfortable
views of the Spirit of God teaching and instructing us by his
word, leading us into all truth, and making us both willing and
obedient to the instruction of his word. And I cannot see the
least use that the greatest knowledge of the disputed points of
religion, which have made such confusions in the world, would
have been to us, if we could have obtained it.-—But I must go on
with the historical part of things, and take every part in its order.




SECTION XXIV.
ROBINSON AND FRIDAY BUILD A CANOE TO CARRY m
FRIDAY'S COUNTRY.—-THEIR SCHEME PREVENTED BY THE AB—
RIVAL OF A PARTY OF SAVAGES.
AFTER Friday and I became more intimately acquainted, andthat
he could understand almost all I said to him, and speak pretty
172 anvesruass or
my own history, or at least so much of it as related to my coming
to this place; how I had lived here, and how long: I let him into
the mystery, for such it was to him, of gunpowder and bullet, and
taught him how to shoot. I gave him a knife, which he was .
wonderfully delighted with; and I made him a belt with a frog
hanging to it, such as in England we wear hangers in; and in the
frog, instead of ahanger, I gave him ahatchet, which was not only
as good a weapon, in some cases, but much more useful upon
other occasions.
I described to him the country of Europe, particularly England,
which I came from; how we lived, how we worshipped God, how
we behaved to one another, and how we traded in ships to all
parts of the world. 1 gave him an account of the wreck which
I had been on board of, and showed him. as near as I could, the
place where she lay; but she was all beaten in pieces before. and
gone. I showed him the ruins of our boat, which we lost when
we escaped, and which I could not stir with my whole strength
then; but was now fallen almost all to pieces. Upon seeing this
boat, Friday stood musing a great while, and said nothing. I
asked him what it was he studied upon? At last, says he, Me
see such boat like come to place at my nation. I did not under-
stand him a good while; but, at last, when I had examined farther
into it, I understood by him, that a boat, such as that had been,
came on shore upon the country where he lived; that is, as ho
3
explained it, was driven thither by stress of weather. I presently
imagined that some European ship must have been cast away
upon their coast, and the boat might get loose, and drive ashore,
but was so dull, that I never once thought of men making their
escape from a wreck thither, much less whence they might come:
so I only inquired after a description of the boat.
Friday'described the boat to me well enough; but brought me
better to understand him when he added, with some warmth, We
save the white mans from drown. Then I presently asked him,
if there were any white mans, as he called them, in the boat?
Yes, he said; the boat full of white mans. I asked him how many’!

came of them? He told me, They live, they dwell at my nation.
This put new thoughts into my head; for I presently imagined
that these might be the men belonging to the ship that was cast
away in the sight of my island, as I now called it; and who, after
the ship was struck on the rock, and they saw her inevitably lost,
had saved themselves in their boat, and were landed upon that
wild shore among the savages. Upon this, I inquired of him
more critically what was become of them; he assured me they
lived still there; that they had been there about four years; that
the savages let them alone, and gave them victuals to live on.
I asked him how it came to pass they did not kill them, and eat
them? He said, N 0, they make brother with them; that is, as I
understood him, a truce; and then he added, They no eat mans

attle.
It was after this some considerable time, that, being upon the
top of the hill, at the east side of the island, from whence, as I
have said, I had, in a clear day, discovered the main or continent
of America, Friday, the weather being very serene, looks very
earnestly towards the main land, and, in a. kind of surprise, falls
a jumping and dancing, and calls out to me, for I was at some
distance from him. I asked him what was the matter? 0 joy
says he; 0 glad! there see my country, there my nation! I ob-
served an extraordinary sense of pleasure a peared in his face,
and his eyes sparkled, and his countenance discovered a strange
eagerness, as if he had a mind to be in his own country again.
This observation of mine put a great many thoughts into me,
ROBINSON CRUSOE. 1| p
as I was before; and I made no doubt but that if Friday could
get back to his own nation again, he would not only forget all
is religion, but all his obligation to me, and would be forward
enough to give his countrymen an account of me, and come back
perhaps with a hundred or two of them, and make a feast upon
me, at which he might be as merry as he used to be with those
of his enemies, when they were taken in war. But I wronged
N 3
I74 anvss'ronss OI
the poor honest creature very much, for which I was very sorry
afterwards. However, as my jealousy increased, and held me
some weeks, I was a little more circumspect, and not so familiar
and kind to him as before: in which I was certainly in the wrong
too; the honest, grateful creature having no thought about it,
but what consisted with the best principles, both as a religious
Christian, and as a grateful friend, as appeared afterwards to my
full satisfaction.
While my jealousy of 'him lasted, you may he sure I was every
day pumping him, to see if he would discover any of the new
thoughts which I suspected were in him: but I found everything
I74 anvss'ronss OI
to nourish my suspicion; and, in spite of all my uneasiness, he
made me at last entirely his own again; nor did he, in the least,
perceive that I was uneasy, and therefore I could not suspect
im of deceit.
One day, walking up the same hill, but the weather being hazy
at-sea, so that we could not see the continent, I called to him,
and said, Friday, do not you wish yourself in your own country,
your own nation f—Yes, he said, I be much 0 glad to be at my
own nation—What would you do there? said I : would you turn
I74 anvss'ronss OI
before? He looked full of concern, and shaking his head, said,
No, no; Friday tell them to live good, tell them to pray God,
I74 anvss'ronss OI
Why then, said I to him, they will kill you. He looked grave
at that, and then said, No, no; they no kill me, they willing love
learn. He meant by this, they would be willing to learn. He
added, they learned much of the bearded mans that came in the
boat. Then I asked him if he would go back to them. He
smiled at that, and told me that he could not swim so far. I told
him, I would make a canoe for him. He told me he would go,
if I would go with him. I go? says I; why, they will eat me,
ifI come there.-—-N0, no, says he; me make they no eat you; me
make they much love you. He meant, he would tell them how
I had killed his enemies, and saved his life, and so he would make
them love me. Then he told me, as well as he could, how kind
they were to seventeen white men, or bearded men, as he called
them, who came on shore there in distress.
From this time, I confess I had a mind to venture over, and
see if I could possibly join with those bearded men, who, I made
no doubt, were Spaniards and Portuguese: not doubting but if I
I74 anvss'ronss OI
upon the continent, and a good company together, better than 1
could from an island forty miles off the shore, and alone, without
help. So, after some days, Itook Friday to work again, by wn.
of discourse; and told him I would give him a boat to go back
to his own nation; and accordingly I carried him to my frigate,
which lay on the other side of the island, and having .cleared it
of water (for I always kept it sunk in water) I brought it out,
showed it him, and we both went into it. lfound he was a most
dexterous fellow at managing it, and would make it go almost
as swift again as I could. So when he was in, I said to him,
Well, now, Friday, shall we go to your nation? He looked very
dull at my saying so; which, it seems, was because he thought
the boat too small to go so far; I then told him I had a bigger;

I had made, but which I could not get into the water. He said
that was big enough: but then, as I had taken no care of it, and
it had lain two or three-and-twenty years there, the sun had split
and dried it, that it was in a manner rotten. Friday told me
such a boat would do very well, and would carry much enough

of going over with him to the continent, that I told him we would
go and make one as big as that, and he should go home in it.
He answered not one word, but looked very grave and sad. I
asked him what was the matter with him? He asked me again,
Why you angry mad with Friday? What me done? I asked
him what he meant? I told him I was not angry with him at
all. No angry? says he, repeating the words several times ;
“'hy send Friday home away to my nation ?--Why, says I, Fri-
day, did not you say you wished you were there ?-Yes, yes, says
he, wish be both there ; no wish Friday there, no master there. In
a word, he would not think of going there without me. I go
there, Friday! says I; what shall [do there? He returned very
quick upon me at this : You do great deal much good, says he;
you teach wild mans be good, sober, tame mans; you tell them

I, thou knowest not what thou sayest ; I am but an ignorant man
myself—Yes, yes, says be, you teachee me good, you teaches
them good—No, no, Friday, says I, you shall go without me
leave me here to live by myself, as I did before. He looked con-
fused again at that word ; and running to one of the hatchets which
he used to wear, he takes it up hastily, and gives it to me. What
must I do with this? says I to him. You take kill Friday, says
he. What must I kill you for? said I again. He returns very
quick, What you send Friday away for? Take kill Friday, no
send Friday away. This he 'spoke so earnestly, that I saw tears
stand in his eyes : in a word, I so plainly discovered the utmost

from me, if he was willing to stay with me.
Upon the whole, as I found, by all his discourse, a. settled

found all the foundation of his desire tc go to his own country

was laid in his ardent affection to the people, and his hopes of my
doing them good; a thing, which, as I had no notion of myself,
so I had not the least thought, or intention, or desire, of under-
taking it. But still I found a strong inclination to my attempting
an escape, as above, founded on the supposition gathered from
the discourse, viz that there were seventeen bearded men there:
and, therefore, without any more delay, I went to work with
176 ADVENTURES or
periagua, or canoe, to undertake the voyage. There were trees
176 ADVENTURES or
or canoes, but even of good large vessels; but the main thing I
looked at was, to get one so near the water that we might launch
176 ADVENTURES or
At last, Friday pitched upon a tree; for I found he knew much
176 ADVENTURES or
to this day, what wood to call the tree we cut down, except that
it was very like the tree we call fustic, or between that and the
Nicaragua wood, for it was much of the same colour and smell.
Friday was for burning the hollow or cavity of this tree out, to
make it for a boat, but I showed him how to cut it with tools;
which, after I had showed him how to use, he did very handily:
176 ADVENTURES or
very handsome; especially when, with our axes, which I showed
him how to handle, we cut and hewed the outside into the true
shape of a boat. After this, however, it cost us near a fortnight’s
time to get her along, as it were inch by inch, upon great rollers,
into the water; but when she was in, she would have carried
twenty men withgreat ease.
When she was in the water, and though she was so big, it
amazed me to see with what dexterity, and how swift my man
Friday would manage her, turn her, and paddle her along. So I
asked him if he would, and if we might, venture over in her.
Yes, he said; we venture over in her very well, though great
blow wind. However, I had a further design, that he knew
176 ADVENTURES or
her with an anchor and cable. As to a mast, that was easy enough
to get: so I pitched upon a straight young cedar tree, which I
found near the place, and which there were great plenty of in
the island; and I set Friday to work to cut it down, and gave
him directions how to shape and order it. But as to the sail,
that was my particular care. I knew I bad old sails, or rather
pieces of old sails, enough; but as I had had them now six-and-
twenty years by me, and had not been very careful to preserve
them, not imagining that I should ever have this kind of use for
them, ] did not doubt but they were all rotten, and, indeed, most
of them were so. However, I found two pieces, which appeared
pretty good, and with these I went to work; and with a great
eal of pains, and awkward stitching, you may be sure, for want
of needles, I, at length, made a three-cornered ugly thing, like
what we call in England a shoulder‘of-mutton sail, to go with a
boom at bottom, and a little short sprit at the top, such as usually
our ship’s long-boats sail with, and such as I best knew how to
manage, as it was such a one I had to the boat in which I made

I {was near two months performing this last work, viz. rigging

shipwright, yet, as I knew the usefulness, and even necessity
of such a thing, I applied myself with so much pains to do it,
that at last 1 brought it to pass; though, considering the many,
dull contrivances I had for it that failed, I think it cost me almost
as much labour as making the boat.
After all this was done, I had my man Friday to teach as to
what belonged to the navigation of my boat; for, though he
knew very well how to paddle a canoe, he knew nothing what
belonged to a sail and a rudder; and was the most amazed when
he saw me work the boat to and again in the sea by the rudder,

course we sailed changed; I say, when he saw this, he stood
like one astonished and amazed. However, with a little use, I
made all these things familiar to him, and he became an expert
sailor, except that, as to the compass I could make him under-
stand very little of that. On the other hand, as there was very
little cloudy weather, and seldom or never any fogs in those
parts, there was the less occasion for acompass, seeing the stars
were always to be seen by night, and the shore by day, except in
the rainy seasons, and then nobody cared to stir abroad, either
by land or sea.
I was now entered on the seven-and-twentieth year of my
captivity in this place; though t e ree ast years that I had
this creature with me ought rather to be left out of the account,
my habitation being quite of another kind than in all the rest
of the time. I kept the anniversary of my landing here with
.. nosmsox causoa 11'
.. nosmsox causoa 11'
now, having such additional testimonies of the care of Providence
over me, and the great he es 1 had of being effectually and
speedily delivered; for I h an invincible impression upon my
t oughts that my deliverance was at hand and that I should
not be another year in this place. I went on, however, with
my husbandry; digging, planting, and fencing, as usual. I
fathered and cured my grapes, and did every necessary thing as
ore.
The rainy season was, in the mean time, upon me, when I kept
more within doors than at other times. We had stowed our
own vessel as secure as we could, bringing her up into the creek,
where, as I said in the beginning, I landed my rafts from the
ship; and hauling her up to the shore, at high-water mark, I
made my man Friday dig a little dock, just big enough to hold
m ~ anvnmars or
and then, when the tide was out, we made a strong dam across
the end of it, to keep the water out; and so she la dry,as to the
tide, from the sea: and to keep the rain off, we lai a great many
boughs of trees, so thick, that she was as well thatched as a
house; and thus we waited for the months of November and
December, in which I designed to make my adventure.
When the settled season began to come in, as the thought
of my design returned with the fairweather, I was pre aring daily

quantity of provisions, being the stores for our voyage; and
intended, in a week or a fortnight’s time, to open the dock, and
launch out our boat. I was busy one morning upon something
of this kind, when I called to Friday, and bid him go to the sea-

we generally got onceaweek, for the sake of the eggs as well as

the ground, or the steps he set his feet on ; and before I had time
to speak to him, he cries out to me, 0 master! 0 master! 0
sorrow! 0 bad !—What's the matter, Friday? says 1. O yonder,
there, says he, one, two, three canoe : one, two, three! By this
way of speaking, I concluded there were six; but, on inquiry, I
found it was but three. Well, Friday, says I, do not be frightened!
So 1 heartened him up as well as I could: however, I saw the
poor fellow was most terribly scared : for nothing ran in his head
but that they were come to look for him, and would cut him in
pieces, and eat him; and the poor fellow trembled so, that I
scarce knew what to do with him. I comforted him as well as I
could, and told him I was in as much danger as he, and that they
Would eat me as well as him. But, says 1, Friday, we must

he; but there come many great number.—No matter for that,
said I, again; our guns wil fright them that we do not kill. So
I asked him whether, if I resolved to defend him, he would
defend me, and stand by me; and do just as 1 bid him. He said,
Me die, when you bid die, master. So I went and fetched a good
dram of rum and gave him ; for I had been so good a husband
of my rum, that I had a great deal left. When he drank it, I
made him take the two fowling-pieces, which we always carried,
and loaded them with large swan—shot, as big as small pistol-
bullcts; then I took four muskets, and loaded them with two
noslsson causos. 179
with a brace of bullets each ; I hung my great sword, as usual,
naked by my side; and gave Friday his hatchet. When I had
thus prepared myself, I took my perspective glass, and went up
to the side of the hill, to see what I could discover; and I found
quickly, by my glass, that there were one-and-twcnty savages,
three prisoners, and three canoes; and that their whole business
seemed to be the triumphant banquet upon these three human
bodies; a barbarous feast indeed! but nothing more than,
as I had observed, was usual with them. I observed also, that
they were landed, not where they had done when Friday made
his escape, but nearer to my creek: where the shore was low,
and where a thick wood came almost close down to the sea.
This, with the abhorrence of the inhuman errand these wretches

again to Friday, and told him I was resolved to go down to them
and kill them all; and asked him if he would stand by me. He
had now got over his fright, and his spirits being a little raised
with the dram I had given him, he was very cheerful, and told
me, as before, he would die when I bid die.

charged, as before, between us; I gave Friday one pistol to stick
in his girdle, and three guns upon his shoulder; and I took one
pistol, and the other three guns myself; and in this posture we
marched out. Itook a small bottle of rum in in pocket, and
gave Friday a large bag with more powder and bu ets; and, as
to orders, I charged him to keep close behind me, and not to stir,
or shoot, or do anything, till I bid him; and, in the mean time.
not to speak a word. In this posture, I fetched a compass to my
right hand of near a mile, as well to get over the creek as to get
into the wood, so that I might come within shot of them before
I should be discovered, which I had seen, by my glass, it was
easy to do.
While I was making this march, my former thoughts returning,
I began to abate my resolution: I do not mean that I entertained
any fear of their number; for, as they were naked, unarmed
wretches, it is certain I was superior to them; nay, though I had
been alone. But it occurred to my thoughts, what call, what
occasion, much less what necessity I was in, to go and dip my
hands in blood, to attack people who had neither done nor in-
tended me any wrong? Who, as to me, were innocent, and whose
barbarous customs were their own disaster; being, in them, a
token indeed of God's having left them, with the other nations
of that part of the world, to such stupidity, and to such inhuman
courses; but did not call me to take upon me to be a judge of
their actions, much less an executioner of his justice; that, when-
noslsson causos. 179
and, by national vengeance, punish them, as a people, for national
crimes; but that, in the mean time, it was none of my busniess;
that, it was true, Friday might justify it, because he was a de-
clared enemy, and in a state of war with those very particular
people, and it was lawful for him to attack them; but I could
not say the same with respect to myself. These things were so
warmly pressed upon my thoughts all the way as I went, that I
resolved I would only go and place myself near them, that I might
observe their barbarous feast, and that I would act then as God
should direct: but that, unless something offered that was more
a call to me than yet I knew of, I would not meddle with them.
With this resolution I entered the wood; and, with all possible
wariness and silence, Friday following close at my heels, I
marched till I came to the skirt of the wood, on the side which
was next to them, only that one corner of the wood lay between
me and them. Here I called softly to Friday, and showing him
a great tree, which was just at the corner of the wood, I bade
him go to the tree, and bring me word if he could see there plainly
what they were doing. He did so; and came immediately back
to me, and told me they might be plainly viewed there; that they
180 mvmrrmms or
and that another lay bound upon the sand, 8, little from them,
180 mvmrrmms or
soul within me. He told me it was not one of their nation, but
one of the bearded men he had told me of, that came to their
180 mvmrrmms or
the white bearded man; and, going to the tree, I saw plainly, b
my glass, a white man, who lay upon the beach of the sea, wit
180 mvmrrmms or
that he was an European, and had clothes on.
There was another tree, and a little thicket beyond it, about
180 mvmrrmms or
going a little way about, I saw I might come at undiscovered,
and that then I should be within half a shot of them; so I with-
held my passion, though I was indeed enraged to the highest
degree; and going back about twenty paces, I got behind some
bushes, which held all the way till I came to the other tree; and
then came to a little rising ground, which gave me a full view
of them, at the distance of about eighty yards.

IOBINSON RELEASES A SPANIARD.—FRIDAY DISCOVERS HIS FATHER.

ARRIVAL OF AN ENGLISH VESSEL.
I HAD now not a moment to lose, for nineteen of the dreadful
wretches sat upon the ground, all close-huddled together, and
had just sent the other two to butcher the poor Christian, and

stooping down to untie the bands at his feet. I turned to Friday
-Now, Friday, said I, do as I bid thee. Friday said he would.
Then, Friday, says I, do exactly as you see me do; fail in nothing.
So I set down one of the muskets and the fowling-piece upon the
ound, and Friday did the like by his; and with the other musket
Irtook my aim at the savages, bidding him to do the like: then

Friday took his aim so much better than I, that on the side
that he shot, he killed two of them, and wounded three more; and
on my side, I killed one, and wounded two. They were, you
may be sure, in a dreadful consternation; and all of them who
were not hurt jumped upon their feet, but did not immediately
know which way to run, or which way to ‘.ook, for they knew
not from whence their destruction came. Friday kept his eyes
close upon me that, as I had bid him, he might observe what I

saw mt ‘nok and present; he did the same again. Are you ready,

and so did Friday; and as our pieces were now loaden with what
I called swan-shot, or small pistol-bullets, we found only two
drop, but so many were wounded, that they ran about yelling
and screaming like mad creatures, all bloody, and most of them
miserably wounded, whereof three more fell quickly after, though
not quite dead.
Now, Friday, says I, laying down the discharged pieces, and
taking up the musket which was yet loaden, follow me; which
he did, with a great deal of courage; upon which I rushed out
of the wood, and showed myself, and Friday close at my foot.
As scenes I perceived they saw me, I shouted as loud as I could,
and bade Friday do so too; and running as fast as I could, which,
by the way, was not very fast, being loaded with arms as I was,
I made directly towards the poor victim, who was, as I said,
lying upon the beach, or shore, between the place where they
sat and the sea. The two butchers, who were just going to work

and three more of the rest made the same way. Iturned to

stood me immediately, and running about forty yards, to be
nearer them, he shot at them, and I thought he had killed them
all, for I saw them all fall of a heap into the boat, though I saw
two of them up again quickly: however, he killed two of them,
and wounded the third, so that he lay down in the bottom of the
boat as if he had been dead.

tongue, what he was. He answered in Latin, Christianus; but
was so weak and faint that'he could scarce stand or speak. I
tom: my bottle out of in pocket, and gave it him, making signs
that he should drink, w ich he did; and I gave him a piece of
bread, which he ate. Then I asked him what countryman he
was: and he said, Espagniole; and being a little recovered, let
me know, by all the signs he could possibly make, how much he
was in my debt for his deliverance. Signor, said I, with as
much Spanish as I could make up, we will talk afterwards, but

and no sooner had he the arms in his hands, but, as if they had

as the whole was a surprise to them, so the poor creatures were

made at him with one of their great wooden swords, the same-

prevented it. The Spaniard, who was as bold and brave as could
e imagined, though weak, had fought this Indian a good while,
and had cut him two great wounds on his head; but the savage
being a stout, lusty fellow, closing in with him, had thrown him
down, being faint, and was wringing my sword out of ‘his hand;
when the Spaniard, though undermost, wisely quitting the sword,
drew the pistol from his girdle, shot the savage through the
body, and killed him upon the spot, before I, who was running
to help him, could come near him.

of the fowling-pieces, with which he pursued two of the sav es,

both got from him into the wood, where Friday pursued them,
and killed one of them, but the other was too nimble for him;
and though he was wounded, yet had plunged himself into the
sea, and swam, with all his might, off to those two who were
left in the canoe, which three in the canoe, with one wounded,
that we knew not whether he died or no, were all that escaped
our hands of one-and»twenty. The account of the whole is as

if not dead.—Twenty-one in all.
Those that were in the canoe worked hard to get out of gun-
shot, and though Friday made two or three shots at them, I did

me take one of their canoes, and pursue them; and indeed, [was
very anxious about their escape, lest, carrying the news home
to their people, they should come back erhaps with two or three

consented to pursue them by sea, and running to one of their
canoes, I jumped in, and bade Friday follow me; but when I was
184 ADVENTURES or
there, bound hand and foot, as the Spaniard was, for the slaughter,
and almost dead with fear, not knowing what was the matter;
for he had not been able to look up over the side of the boat, he
was tied so hard neck and heels, and had been tied so long, that
he had really but little life in him.
184 ADVENTURES or
bound him with, and would have helped him up; but he could
not stand or speak, but groaned most piteously, believing, it
seems, still, that he was only unbound in order to be killed.
When Friday came to him, I bade him speak to him, and tell
him of his deliverance; and, pulling out my bottle, made him
give the poor wretch a dram; which, with the news of his being
delivered, revived him, and he sat up in the boat. But when
Friday came to hear him speak, and look in his face, it would
have moved any one into tears to have seen how Friday kissed
him, embraced him, hugged him, cried, laughed, hallooed, jumped
about, danced, sung; then cried again, wrung his hands, beat
his own face and head; and then sung and jumped about again,
like a distracted creature. It was a good while before I could
make him speak to me, or tell me what was the matter ; but when
he came a little to himself, he told me that it was his father.
It is not easy for me to express how it moved me to see what
184 ADVENTURES or
sight of his father, and or his being delivered from death; nor,
indeed, can I describe half the extravagancies of his affection after
this; for he went into the boat, and out of the boat, a great many
times: when he went in to him, he would sit down by him, open
his breast, and hold his father's head close to his bosom for many
minutes together, to nourish it; then he took his arms and ankles,
which were numbed and stiff with the binding, and chafed and
rubbed them with his hands; and I, perceiving what the case
was, gave him some rum out of my bottle to rub them with, which
did them a great deal of good.
This affair put an end to our pursuit of the canoe with the
other savages, who were got now almost out of sight; audit was
happy for us that we did not, for it blew so hard within two hours
after, and before they could be got a quarter of their way, and
continued blowing so hard all night, and that from the north-
west, which was against them, that I could not suppose their
boat could live, or that they ever reached their own coast.
But, to return to Friday; he was so busy about his father,
nonmson causes. [85
but after I thought he could leave him a little, I called him to
me, and he came jumping and laughing, and pleased to the
highest extreme; then I asked him if he had given his father
any bread. He shook his head, and said, None; ugly dog eat
all up self. I then gave him a cake of bread, out of a little
ouch I carried on purpose: I also gave him a dram for himself;
ut he would not taste it, but carried it to his father. I had in
my pocket two or three bunches of raisins, so I gave him a
handful of them for his father. He had no sooner given his
father these raisins, but I saw him come out of the boat, and
run away, as if he had been bewitched, he ran at such a rate;
for he was the swiftest fellow on his feet that ever I saw: I say,
he ran at such a rate, that he was out of sight, as it were, in an
instant; and though I called, and hallooed out too, after him, it
was all one, away he went; and in a quarter of an hour I saw
him come back again, though not so fast as he went; and as he
came nearer, Ifound his pace slacker, because he had something
in his hand. When he came up to me, Ifound he had been
guite home for an earthen jug, or pot, to bring his father some
resh water, and that he had two more cakes or loaves of bread;
the bread he gave me, but the water he carried to his father;
however, as I was very thirsty too, I took a little sup cf it.
The water revived his father more than all the rum or spirits
I had given him, for he was just fainting with thirst.
When his father had drunk, I called to him to know if there
was any water left : he said, Yes; and I bade him give it to the
poor Spaniard, who was in as much want of it as his father:
and I sent one of the cakes that Friday brought to the Spaniard
too, who was indeed very weak, and was reposing himself upon
a green place under the shade of a tree; and whose limbs were
also very stiff, and very much swelled with the rude bandage he
had been tied with. When I saw that, upon Friday's coming to
him with the water, he sat up and drank, and took the bread,
and began to eat, Iwent to him and gave him a handful of
raisins : he looked up in my face with all the tokens of gratitude
and thankfulness that could appear in any countenance ; but
was so weak, notwithstanding he had so exerted himself in the
nonmson causes. [85
two or three times, but was really not able, his ankles were so
swelled and so painful to him; so I bade him sit still, and caused
Friday to rub his ankles, and bathe them with rum, as he had
done his father’s.
I observed the poor affectionate creature, every two minutes,
or perhaps less, all the while he was here, turn his head about
to see if his father was in the same place and posture as he left
him sitting: and at last he found he was not to be seen; at
nonmson causes. [85
that swiftness to him, that one could scarce perceive his feet to
touch the ground as he went: but when he came, he only found
he had lain himself down to ease his limbs, so Friday came
back to me presently; and then I spoke to the Spaniard to let
Friday help him up, if he could, and lead him to the boat, and
then he should carry him to our dwelling, where I would take
care of him : but Friday, a lusty strong fellow, took the
Spaniard quite up upon his_ back, and carried him away to the
boat, and set him down softly upon the side or gunnel of the
canoe, with his feet in the inside of it; and then, lifting him
quite in, he set himself close to his father; and presently step-
180 anvnsrnnns or
shore faster than I could walk, though the wind blew pretty
hard too: so he brought them both safe into our creek, and
leaving them in the boat, ran away to fetch the other canoe.
As he passed me, I spoke to him, and asked him whither he
went. He told me, Go fetch more boat: so away he went like
the wind, for sure never man or horse ran like him; and he had
the other canoe in the creek almost as soon as I got to it by
land; so he wafted me over, and then went to help our new
guests out of the boat, which he did ; but they were neither of
them able to walk, so that poor Friday knew not what to do.
To remedy this, I went to work in my thought, and calling to
Friday to bid them sit down on the bank while he came to me,
I soon made a kind of a hand-barrow to lay them on, and Fri-
day and I carried them both up together upon it, between us.
180 anvnsrnnns or
tion, we were at a worse loss than before, for it was impossible
to get them over, and I was resolved not to break it down: so
I set to work again; and Friday and I, in about two hours'
time, made a very handsome tent, covered with old sails, and
above that with boughs of trees, being in the space without our
outward fence, and between that and the grove of young wood
which 1 had planted; and here we made them two beds of such
things as I had, viz. of good rice straw, with blankets laid upon
it, to lie on, and another to cover them, on each bed.
My island was now peopled, and I thought myself rich in
180 anvnsrnnns or
how like a king I looked. First of all, the whole country was
my own mere property, so that I had an undoubted right of do-
minion. Secondly, my people were perfectly subjected; I was

and were ready to lay down their lives, if there had been

subjects, and they were of three different religions: my man
Friday was a Protestant, his father was a Pagan and a cannibal,
and the Spaniard was a Papist: however, I allowed liberty of
ctnscience throughout my dominions.—But this is by the way.
As soon as I had secured my two weak rescued prisoners,
and given them shelter, and a place to rest them upon, I began

my dinner also with them, and, as well as I could, cheered them,
and encouraged them. Friday was my interpreter, especially to
his father, and, indeed, to the Spaniard too; for the Spaniard
spoke the language of the savages pretty well.

and, the next day, I ordered him to go and bury the dead bodies
of the savages, which lay open to the sun, and would presently
be offensive. I also ordered him to bury the horrid remains
of their barbarous feast, which I knew were pretty much,
and which I could not think of doing myself; nay, I could not
bear to see them, if I went that way; all which he punctually

do, if they came safe on shore, he said he knew not; but it was
his opinion, that they were so dreadfully frightened with the

believed they would tell the people they were all killed by thunder
and lightning, not by the hand of man; and that the two which
appeared, viz. Friday and I, were two heavenly spirits, or furies,
come down to destroy them, and not men with weapons. This,
he said, he knew: because he heard them all cry out so, in their
language one to another; for it was impossible for them to con-

In a little time, however, no more canoes appearing, the fear
of their coming wore off; and I began to take my former thoughts
of a voyage to the main into consideration; being likewise assured,
by Friday’s father, that I might depend upon good usage from
their nation, on his account, ifI would go. But my thoughts were
a little suspended when I hada serious discourse with the Spaniard,
and when I understood that there were sixteen more of his
countrymen and Portuguese, who, having been cast away, and
made their escape to that side, lived there at peace, indeed, with the
savages, but were very sore put to it for necessaries, and indeed
for life. I asked him all the particulars of their voyage, and
found they were a Spanish ship, bound from the Rio de la Plata,
to the Havanna, being directed to leave their loading there, which

arrived, almost starved, on the cannibal coast, where they ex-

had some arms with them, but they were perfectly useless, for
that they had neither powder nor ball, the washing of the sea
having spoiled all their powder, but a little, which they used at

I asked him what he thought would become of them there, and
if they had formed no design of making any escape. He said
they had many consultations about it; but that having neither
vessel, nor tools to build one, nor provisions of any kind, their
councils always ended in tears and despair. I asked him how
oe thought they would receive a proposal from me, which might
tend towards, an escape; and whether, if they were all here, it
might not be done. I told him, with freedom, I feared mostly
their treachery and ill usage of me, if I put my life in their hands,
for that gratitude was no inherent virtue in the nature of man,
nor did men alway square their dealings by the obligations they
had received, so much as they did by the advantages they ex-
pected. I told him it would be very hard that I should be the
Instrument of their deliverance, and that they should afterwards
make me their prisoner in New Spain, where an Englishman was

loever brought him thither; and that I had rather be delivered
up to the savages, and be devoured alive, than fall into the
merciless claws of the priests, and be carried into the Inqui-
sition. I added, that otherwise I was persuaded, if they were
all here, we might, with so many hands, build a bark large
enough to carry us all away, either to the Brazils, southward,
or to the islands, or Spanish coast, northward; but that if,
in requital, they should, when I had put weapons into their
hands, carry me by force among their own people, I might
be ill used for my kindness to them, and make my case worse
than it was before.
He answered with a great deal of candour and ingenuousness,
that their condition was so miserable, and they were so sensible
of it, that he believed they would abhor the thought of using any
man unkindly that should contribute to their deliverance; and
that, if I pleased, he would go to them with the old man, and
discourse with them about it, and return again, and bring me
their answer; that he would make conditions with them upon
their solemn oath, that they should be absolutely under my
leading, as their commander and captain; and that they should
swear, upon the holy sacraments and gospel, to be true to me,
and go to such Christian country as that I should agree to, and
no other, and to be directed wholly and absolutely by my orders,
till they were landed safely in such country as I intended; and
that he would bring a contract from them, under their hands, for

self, that he would never stir from me as long as he lived, till I
ave him orders; and that he would take my side to the last
rop of his blood, if there should happen the least breach of faith
among his countrymen. He told me they were all of them very
civil, honest men, and they were under the greatest distress
imaginable, having neither weapons, nor clothes, nor any food,
but at the mercy and discretion of the savages; out of all hopes
of ever returning to their own country; and that he was sure,
if I would undertake their relief, they would live and die by me.
Upon these assurances, I resolved to venture to relieve them,
if possible, and to send the old savage and this Spaniard over to
them to treat. But when we had got all things in readiness to
go, the Spaniard himself started an objection, which had so much
prudence in it, on one hand, and so much sincerity, on the other

his advice, put off the deliverance of his comrades for at least
half a year. The case was thus: He had been with us now about
a month, during which time I had let him see in what manner I
had rovided, with the assistance of Providence, for my sup ort;
Ind e saw evidently what stockgoi'corn and rice I had laid, up;

countrymen, who were, as he said, sixteen, still alive, should

vessel, if we should build one, for a v0 age to any of the
Christian colonies of America; so he tol me he thought it
would be more advisable to let him and the other two dig and
cultivate some more land, as much as I could spare seed to sow,
and that we should wait another harvest, that we might have a
upply of corn for his countrymen, when they should come; for
want might be a temptation to them to disagree, or not to think

His caution was so seasonable, and his advice so good, that I
could not but be very well pleased with his proposal, as well as

and in about a month’s time, by the end of which it was seed“

rice; which was, in short, all the seed we had to spare: nor,

to put us ut of fear of the savages, if they had come, unless
their num had been very great, we went freely all over the
island, whenever we found occasion: and as here we had our
escape or deliverance upon our thoughts, it was impossible, at
least for me, to have the means of it out of mine. For this pur-

and then I caused the Spaniard, to whom I imparted my thought

planks, and I caused them to do the like, till they had made
about a dozen large planks of good oak, near two feet broad,

we got about twenty young kids to breed up with the rest; for
whenever we shot the dam, we saved the kids, and added them

barrels; and these, with our bread, was a great part of our food,
and was very good living, too, I assure you, for it is exceedingly
nourishing.
It was now harvest, and our crop in good order: it was not
the most plentiful increase I had seen in the island, but, how-
ever, it was enough to answer our end; for from twenty-two
bushels of barley we brought in and threshed out above two
hundred and twenty bushels, and the like in proportion of the
rice; which was store enough for our food to the next harvest,
though all the sixteen Spaniards had been on shore with me; or
if we had been ready for avoyage, it would very plentifully have
victualled our ship to have carried us to any part of the world,
that is to say, any part of America. When we had thus housed
and secured our magazine of corn, we fell to work to make more
wickerware, viz. great baskets, in which we kept it; and the
Spaniard was very handy and dexterous at this part, and often
blamed me that I did not make some things for defence of this
kind of work; but I saw no need of it.
And now, having a full supply of food for all the guests I ex-
pected, I gave the Spaniard leave to go over to the main, to see
what he could do.with those he had left behind him there.
I gave him a strict charge not to bring any man with him who

for them in order to their deliverance; but that "they would
stand by him, and defend him against all such attempts, and
wherever they went, would be entirely under and subjected to
his command; and that this should be put in writing, and
signed with their hands. How they were to have done this,
when I knew they had neither pen nor ink, was a question
which we never asked. Under these instructions, the Spaniard
and the old savage, the father of Friday, went away in one of
the canoes which they might be said to come in, or rather were
brought in, when they came as prisoners to be devoured by the

me, in view of my deliverance, for now twenty-seven years and
192 sovam'o ass or
some days. I gave them provisions of bread, and of dried
grapes, sufficient for themselves for many days, and sufficient for
all the Spaniards for about eight days’ time; and wishing them
a good voyage, I saw them go; agreeing with them about a sig-
nal they should hang out at their return, by which I should
know them again, when they came back, at a distance, before
they came on shore. They went away with a fair gale, on the
day that the moon was at full, by my account in the month of
October; but as for an exact reckoning of days, after I had once
lost it, I could never recover it again; nor had I kept even the
number of years so punctually as to be sure I was right; though,
as it proved, when I afterwards examined my account, I found
I had kept a true reckoning of years.
It was no less than eight days I had waited for them, when a
strange and unforeseen accident intervened, of which the like has
not perhaps been heard of in history. I was fast asleep in my
hutch one morning, when my man Friday came running in to
me, and called aloud, 'Master, master, they are come, they are
come! I jumped up, and, regardless of danger, I went out as
soon as I could get my clothes on, through my little grove,
which, by the way, was by this time grown to be a very thick
wood; I say, regardless of danger, I went without my arms,
which it was not my custom to do; but I was surprised, when
turning my eyes to the sea, I presently saw a boat about a
league and a half distance, standing in for the shore, with a
shoulder-of-mutton sail, as they call it, and the wind blowing
pretty fair to bring them in: also I observed presently, that they
did not come from that side which the shore lay on, but from
the southernmost end of the island. Upon this, I called Friday
in, and bade him lie close, for these were not the people we looked
for, and that we might not know yet whether they were friends
or enemies. In the next place, I went in to fetch my perspective
glass, to see what I could make of them; and having taken the
ladder out, I climbed up to the top of the bill, as I used to do
when I was apprehensive of anything, and to take my view the
plainer without being discovered. I had scarce set my foot upon
the bill, when my eye plainly discovered a ship lying at an anchor,
at abo t two leagues and a half distance from me, S.S.E., but
not 8. vs a league and a half from the shore. By my obser-
vation, it appeared plainly to be an English ship, and the boat
appeared to be an English long-boat.
I cannot express the confusion I was in; though the joy of
seeing a ship, and one that I had reason to believe was manned
by my own countrymen, and, consequently, friends, was such as
I cannot describe; but yet I had some secret doubts hang about
me—I cannot tell from whence they came, bidding me keep upon
192 sovam'o ass or
nusmess an English ship could have in that part of the world,
since it was not the way to or from any part of the world where

to drive them in there, as in ‘distress; and that if they were
really English, it was most robable that they were here upon
no good design; and that I had better continue as I was, than
fall into the hands of thieves and murderers.
Let no man despise the secret hints and notices of danger,
which sometimes are given him when he may think there is no
possibility of its being real. That such hints and notices are
given us, I believe few that have made any observations of things
can deny; that they are certain discoveries of an invisible world,
and a converse of spirits, we cannot doubt; and if the tendency
of them seems to be to warn us of danger, why should we not
suppose they are from some friendly agent (whether supreme, or
inferior and subordinate, is not the question), and that they are
given for our good?
ROBINSON cantor. 198
this reasoning; for had I not been made cautious by this secret
admonition, come it from whence it will, I had been undone in-
evitably, and in a far worse condition than before, as you will see
presently. I had not kept myself long in this posture, but I
saw the boat draw near the shore, as if they looked for a creek
to thrust in at, for the convenience of landing; however, as they
did not come quite far enough, they did not see the little inlet
where I formerly landed my rafts, but run their boat on shore
upon the beach, at about half a mile from me, which was
very happy for me; for otherwise they would have landed just
at my door, as I may say, and would soon have beaten me out
of my castle, and perhaps have plundered me of all I had. When

did not prove so; there were in all eleven men, whereof three

took those three out of the boat, as prisoners; one of the three

two, I could perceive, lifted up their hands sometimes, and ap-

I was perfectly confounded at the sight, and knewnot what the
meaning of it should be. Friday called out to me in English, as
Well as he could, 0 master! you see English mans eat prisoner
as well as savage mans—Why, Friday, says I, do you think they
are going to eat them thenf—Yes, says riday, they Will eat
them—No, no, says I, Friday; I am afraid they Will murder
them, indeed, but on may be sure they Wlll not eat them.
All this while I Iliad no thought of what the matter really was,
but stood trembling with the horror of the sight, expecting eve
moment when the three prisoners should be killed; nay, once
saw one of the villains lift up his arm with a great cutlass, II
the seamen call it, or sword, to strike one of the poor men; and
I expected to see him fall every moment; at which all the blood
in my body seemed to run chill in my veins. I wished heartily
now for my Spaniard, and the savage that was gone with him,
or that I had any way to have come undiscovered within shot
of them, that I might have rescl'ied the three men, for 1 saw no

another way. Afterl had observed the outrageous usage of the
three men by the insolent seamen, I observed the fellows run
scattering about the island, as if they wanted to see the country.
I observed that the three other men had liberty to go also where
they pleased; but they sat down all three upon the ground,
very pensive, and looked like men in despair. This put me in
I“ ADVENTURE 0'
about me: how I gave myself over for lost; how wildly I looked
around me; what dreadful apprehensions I had; and how I
lodged in the tree all night, for fear of being devoured by Wild
beasts. As I knew nothing that night of the supply I was to
receive by the providential driving of the ship nearer the land
by the storms and tide, by which I have since been so long
nourished and supported; so these three poor desolate men
knew nothing how. certain of deliverance and supply they were,
how near it was to them, and how effectually and really they
were in a condition of safety, at the same time that they thought
themselves lost, and their case desperate. So little do we see
before us in the world, and so much reason have we to depend
cheerfully upon the great Maker of the world, that he does not
leave his creatures so absolutely destitute, but that, in the worst
circumstances, they have always something to be thankful for,
and sometimes are nearer their deliverance than they imagine,
nay, are even brought to their deliverance by the means by
which rhey seem to be brought to their destruction

IT was just at the top of high water when these people came on
shore; and partly while they rambled about to see what kind
Jf a place they were in, they had carelessly stayed till the tide
was spent, and the water was ebbed considerably away, leaving
their boat aground. They had left two men in the boat, who, as
I found afterwards, having drunk a little too much brandy, fell
asleep; however, one of them waking a little sooner than the

hallooed out for the rest, who were straggling about; upon which
they all soon came to the boat: but it was past all their strength
to launch her, the boat being very heavy, and the shore on that
side being a soft oozy sand, almost like a quicksand. In this
condition, like true seamen, who are perhaps the least of all man-
kind given to forethought, they gave it over, and away they
strolled about the country again; and I heard one'of them say
aloud to another, calling them off from the boat, Why, let her

It was my design, as I said above, not to have made any
attempt till it was dark: but about two o'clock, being the heat
of the day, I found that, in short, they were all gone straggling
into the woods, and as I thought, laid down to sleep. The three
poor distressed men, too anxious for their condition to get any
sleep, were, however, sat down under the shelter of a great tree,
at about a quarter of a mile from me, and, as I thought, out of
sight of any of the rest. Upon this I resolved to discover my-

Gentlemen, said I, do not be surprised at me; perhaps you may
have a friend near, when you did not expect it.—-He must be
sent directly from Heaven then, said one of them very gravely
to me, and pulling off his hat at the same time to me; for our
condition is past the help of mam—All help is from Heaven, sir,

for 01.1 seem to be in some great distress. I saw you when you

brutes that came wit you, I saw one of them lift up his sword
to kill you.
The poor man, with tears running down his face, and trem-
bling, looking like one astonished, returned, Am I talking to
God or man? Is it a real man or an angel ?--Be in no fear about
that, sir, said I; if God had sent an angel to relieve you, he
would have come better clothed, and armed after another manner
than you see me: pray lay aside your fears; I am a man, an
Englishman, and disposed to assist you: you see I have one
servant only; we have arms and ammunition; tell us freely, can
We serve, you? What is your case ?—Our case, said he, sir, is
£00 long to well you, while our murderers are so near us; but, in
short, sir, I was commander of that ship, my men have mutinied
against me; they have been hardly prevailed on not to murdelI
me; and at last have set me on shore in this desolate place, with
these two men with me, one my mate, the other a passenger.
where we expected to perish, believing the place to be unin-

brutes, your enemies? said I : Do you know where they are gone'l
—There they lie, sir, said be, pointing to a thicket of trees; my
heart trembles for fear they have seen us, and heard you speak;
if they have, they will certainly murder us all.—-Have they any

of which they left in the boat. Well then, said I, leave the rest
to me; I see they are all asleep, it is an easy thing to kill them
all: but shall we rather take them prisoners? He told me there
were two desperate villains among them, that it was scarce safe
to show any mercy to; but if they were secured, he believed all
the rest would return to their duty. I asked him which the
were? He told me he could not at that distance distinguis
them, but he would obey my orders in anything I would direct.
Well, says I, let us retreat out of their view or hearing, lest the
awake, and we will resolve further. So they willingly went bac
with me, till the woods covered us from them.
Look you, sir, said I, if I venture upon your deliverance, are
you willing to make two conditions with me? He anticipated
my proposals, by telling me, that both he and the ship, if re-
covered, should be wholl directed and commanded by me in
every thing; and, if the ship was not recovered, he would live
and die with me in what part of the world soever I would send
him; and the two other men said the same. Well, says I, my
nonmsow cnusoe. 197
with me, you will not pretend to any authority here; and if I
put arms in your hands, you will, upon all occasions, give them
up to me, and do no prejudice to me or mine upon this island;
and, in the mean time, be governed by my orders: secondly,
That if the ship is, or may be recovered, you will carry me and

He gave me all the assurances that the invention or faith of
man could devise, that he would comply with these most reason-
able demands; and, besides, would owe his life to me, and
acknowledge it upon all occasions, as long as he lived. Well
then, said I, here are three muskets for you, with powder and
ball: tell me next what you think is proper to be done. He
showed me all the testimonies of his gratitude that he was able,
but offered to be wholly guided by me. I told him I thought it
was hard venturing any thing; but the best method I could think

them, and so put it wholly upon God's providence to direct the
shot. He said very modestly, that he was loatl: to kill them, i!
he could help it: but that those two were incorrigible villains
and had been the authors of all the mutiny in the ship, and if
they escaped, we should be undone still; for they would go on
board and bring the whole ship's company, and destroy us all.
Well then, says I, necessity legitimates my advice, for it is the
only way to save our lives. However, seeing him still cautious
of shedding blood, I told him they should go themselves and
manage as they found convenient.
In the middle of this discourse we heard some of them awake,
and soon after we saw two of them on their feet. I asked him
if either of them were the heads of the mutiny? He said no. Well
then, said I, you may let them escape; and Providence seems to
have awakened them on purpose to save themselves. Now, says
I, if the rest escape you, it is your fault. Animated with this,

two men, the captain wisely reserving his own piece. They had
so well aimed their shot at the men they knew, that one of them
was killed on the spot, and the other very much wounded; but
not being dead, he started up on his feet, and called eagerly for
help to the others; but the captain stepping to him, told him it
was too late to cry for help, he should call upon God to forgive
his villany; and with that word knocked him down with the stock
of his musket, so that he never spoke more; there were three
more in the company, and one of them was also slightly wounded
By this time I was come; and when they saw their danger, and
that it was in vain to resist, they begged for mercy. The captain
told them he would spare their lives, if they would give him any
assurance of their abhorrence of the treachery they had been
guilty of, and would swear to be faithful to him in recovering the
ship, and afterwards in carrying her back to Jamaica, from whence
they came. They gave him all the protestations of their sincerity
that could be desired, and he was willing to believe them, and
spare their lives, which I was not against, only that l obliged
him to keep them bound hand and foot while they were on the
island.
While this was doing, I sent Friday with the captain’s mate
to the boat, with orders to secure her, and bring away the oars \
and sails, which they did: and by and by three straggling men,
that were (happily for them) parted from the rest, came back

seemed to have been preserved there on purpose to save his life,
the tears ran down his face, and he could not speak a word more.
After this communication was at an end, I carried him and his
two men into my apartment, leading them in just where I came
out, viz. at the top of the house, where I refreshed them with
such provisions as I had, and showed them all the contrivances
I had made, during my long, long inhabiting that place.
All I showed them, all I said to them, was perfectly amazing;

perfectly I had concealed my retreat with a grove of trees, which,
aving been now planted near twenty years, and the trees grow-
ing much faster than in England, was become a little wood, and
so thick, that it was impassable in any part of it, but at that one
side where I had reserved my little winding passage into it. I
told him this was my castle and my residence, but that I had a
seat in the country, as most princes have, whither I could retreat
upon occasion, and I would show him that too another time; but
at present our business was to consider how to recover the ship.
He agreed with me as to that; but told me he was perfectly at a
less what measures to take, for that there were still six-and-
twenty bands on board, who having entered into a cursed con-
spiracy, b which they had all forfeited their lives to the law,
would he hardened in it now by desperation, and would carry it
on, knowing that, if they were subdued, they would be brought
to the gallows, as soon as they came to England, or to any of
the English colonies; and that, therefore, there would be no at-
tacking them with so small a number as we were.
I mused for some time upon what he had said, and found it
was a very rational conclusion, and that, therefore, something
was to be resolved on speedily, as well to draw the men on board
into some snare for their surprise, as to prevent their landing
upon us, and destroying us. Upon this, it presently occurred to
me, that in a little while the ship’s crew, wondering what was
become of their comrades, and of the heat, would certainly come
on shore in their other boat, to look for them; and that then,
erhaps, they might come armed, and be too strong for us: this

We knocked a great hole in her bottom, that if they had come
strong enough to master us, yet they could not carry off the boat.
Indeed, it was not much in my thoughts that we could be able
to recover the ship; but my view was, that if they went away

As the ship lay almost two leagues from the shore, we had a
full view of them as they came, and a plain sight even of their
faces; because the tide having set them a little to the east of
the other boat, they rowed up under shore, to come to the same
place where the other had landed, and where the boat lay; by
this means, I say, we had a full view of them, and the captain
knew the persons and characters of all the men in the boat, of
whom, he said, there were three very honest fellows, who, he
was sure, were led into this conspiracy by the rest, being over-

were as outrageous as any of the ship’s crew, and were no doubt
made desperate in their new enterprise; and terribly apprehen-

at him, and told him that men in our circumstances were past

could be was better than that which we were supposed to be in,
we ought to expect that the consequence, whether death or life,
Would be sure to he a deliverance. I asked him what he thought
of the urcumstances of my life, and whether a deliverance were
not worth venturing for? And where, sir, said I, is your belief
of my being preserved here on purpose to save your life, which
elevated you a little while ago; for my part, said I, there seems
to me but one thing amiss in all the prospect of it. What is that!

four honest fellows among them, which should be spared, had
they been all of the wicked part of the crew, I should have thought
God’s providence had singled them outto deliver them into your

this with a raised voice and cheerful countenance, I found it
greatly encouraged him; so we set vigorously to our business.

and were very thankful that they had such good usage as to
have provisions and light left them; for Friday gave them can-
dles (such as we made ourselves) for their comfort; and they did
not know but that he stood sentinel over them at the entrance.
The other prisoners had better usage: two of them were kept
pinioned, indeed, because the captain was not free to trust them;
ut the other two were taken into In service, upon the captain’s
recommendation, and upon their solemnly engaging to live and
die with us; so with them and the three honest men we were
seven men well armed; and I made no doubt we should be able
to deal well enough with the ten that were coming, considering
that the captain had said that there were three or four honest
men among them also. As soon as they got to the lace where
their other boat lay, they ran their boat into the bean , and came
on shore, hauling the boat up after them, which I was glad to
see; for I was afraid they would rather have left the boat at an
anchor, some distance from the shore, with some hands in her
to guard her, and so we should not be able to seize the boat.

this, they set up two or three great shouts, hallooing with all

in the cave we were sure could not hear; and those in our keep-
ing, though they heard it well enough, yet durst give no answer
to them. They were so astonished at the surprise of this, that,
as they told us afterwards, they resolved to go all on board again
to their ship, and let them know that the men were all murdel‘L I,
and the long-boat‘staved; accordingly, they immediately launched
their b’tgt again, and got all of them on board.
The captain was terribly amazed and even confounded at this,
202 anvasrvans or /
giving their comrades over for lost, and so he should still lose
the ship, which he was in hopes we should have recovered; but
he was uickly as much frightened the other way.
They‘liad not been long put off with the boat, but we per-
ceived them all coming on shore again; but with this new
measure in their onduct, which it seems they consulted toge-
ther upon, viz. to av three men in the boat, and the rest to go
on shore, and go u nto the country to look for their fellows.
This was a great disappointment to us, for now we were at a loss
what to do; as our seizing those seven men on shore would be
no advantage to us, if we let the boat escape; because they would
then row away to the ship, and then the rest of them would be
sure to weigh and set sail, and so our recovering the ship would
be lost. However, we had no remedy but to wait and see what
the issue of things might present. The seven men came on shore,
202 anvasrvans or /
distance from the shore, and came to an anchor to wait for them:
so that it was impossible for us to come at them in the boat.
Those that came on shore kept close together, marching towards
the top of the little hill under which my habitation lay; and we
could see them plainly, though they could not perceive us. We
could have been very glad they would have come nearer to us,
202 anvasrvans or /

they were come to the brow of the hill, where they could see a
great way into the valleys and woods, which lay towards the
north-east part, and where the island lay lowest, they shouted
and hallooed till they were weary; and not caring, it seems, to
venture far from the shore, nor far from one another, they sat
down together under a tree, to consider of it. Had they thought
202 anvasrvans or /
done, they had done the job for us; but they were too full of

I‘he captain made a very just proposal to me upon this con-
202 anvasrvans or /

all sally upon them, just at the juncture when their pieces were
all discharged, and they would certainly yield, and we should
have them without bloodshed. I liked this proposal, provided
it was done while we were near enough to come up to them
before they could load their pieces again. But this even did not
happen; and we lay still a long time, very irresolute what
course to take. At length I told them there would be nothing
done, in my opinion, till night; and then, if they did not return

and the shore, and so might use some stratagem with them in the
boat to get them on shore. We waited a great while, though
very impatient for their removing; and were very uneas , when,
after long consultations, we saw them all start up, an march
down towards the sea: it seems they had such dreadful appre-
hensions upon them of the danger of the place, that they resolved
to go on board the ship again, give their companions over for
lost, and so go on with their intended voyage with the ship.
As soon as I perceived them to go towards the shore, I ima-
gined it to be, as it really was, that they had given over their
search, and were for going back again; and the captain, as soon
as I told him my thoughts, was ready to sink at the apprehen-
sions of it: but I presently thought of a stratagem to fetch them
back again, and which answered my end to a tittle. I ordered
Friday and the captain’s mate to go over the little creek west-
ward, towards the (place where the savages came on shore when
Friday was rescue , and as soon as they came to a little rising
and, at about half a mile distance, I bade them halloo out, as
Fdiid as they could, and wait till they found the seamen heard
them; that as soon as ever they heard the seamen answer them,
they should return it again; and then keeping out of sight, take
a round, always answering when the others hallooed, to draw
them as far into the island, and among the woods, as possible,
and then wheel about again to me, by such ways as I directed
them.
They were just going into the boat when Friday and the mate
hallooed: and they presently heard them, and answering, run
along the shore westward, towards the voice they heard, when
they were presently stopped by the creek, where the water being
up, they could not get over, and called for the boat to come up
and set them over; as, indeed, I expected. When they had set
themselves over, I observed that the boat being gone a good
way-into the creek, and, as it were, in a harbour within the land,
they took one of the three men out of her, to go along with
them, and left only two in the boat, having fastened her to
the stump of a little tree on the shore. This was what I wished
for; and immediately leaving Friday and the captain's mate to
their business, I took the rest with me, and crossing the creek
2 -
out of their sight, we surprised the two men before they were
aware; one of them lying on the shore, and the other being in
the boat. The fellow on shore was between sleeping and waking,
and going to start up ; the captain, who was foremost, ran in upon
him, and knocked him down; and then called out to him in the
boat to yield, or he was a dead man. There needed very few
204, ADVENTURES or
men upon him, and his comrade knocked down; besides, this was,
it seems, one of the three who were not so hearty in the mutiny
88 the rest of the crew, and therefore was easily persuaded not
only to yield, but afterwards to join very sincerely with us. In
the mean time, Friday and the captain’s mate so well managed
their business with the rest, that they drew them, by hallooing
and answering, from one hill to another, and from one wood to
another, till they not only heartily tired them, but left them
where they were very sure they could not reach back to the boat
before it was dark; and, indeed, they were heartily tired them-
selves also, by the time they came back to us.
We had nothing now to do but to watch for them in the dark,
and to fall upon them, so as to make sure work with them. It
was several hours after Friday came back to me before they came
back to their boat; and we could hear the foremost of them, long
before they came quite up, calling to those behind to come along;
and could also hear them answer, and complain how lame and
tired they were, and not able to come any faster, which was very
welcome news to us. At length they came up to the boat: but
it is impossible to express their confusion when they found the
boat fast aground in the creek, the tide ebbed out, and their two
men gone. We could hear them call to one another in a most
lamentable manner, telling one another they were got into an
enchanted island: that either there were inhabitants in it, and
they should all be murdered, or else there were devils and spirits
in it, and they should be all carried away and devoured. They.
hallooed again, and called their two comrades by their names a
great many times; but no answer. After some time, we could
see them, by the little light there was, run about, wringing their
hands like men in despair; and that sometimes they would go
and sit down in the boat, to rest themselves; then come ashore
again, and walk about again, and so the same thing over again.
My men would fain have had me give them leave to fall upon
them at once in the dark ; but I was willing to take them at some
advantage, so to spare them, and kill as few of them as I could;
and especially I was unwilling to hazard the killing any of our
men, knowing the others were very well armed. I resolved to
wait, to see if they did not separate; and, therefore, to make sure
of them, I drew my ambuscade nearer, and ordered Friday and
the captain to creep upon their hands and feet, as close to the
ground as they could, that they might not be discovered, and

They had not been long in that posture, when the boatswain,
who was the principal ringleader of the mutiny, and had now
shown himself the most dejected and dispirited of all the rest,
came walking towards them, with two more of the crew: the
captain was so eager at having this principal rogue so much in
his power, that he could hardly have patience to let him come so
near as to be sure of him, for they only heard his tongue before:

with my whole army, which was now eight men, viz. myself,
generallssimo; Friday, my lieutenant-general; the captain and
his two men, and the three prisoners of war, whom we had trusted
with arms. We came upon them, indeed, in the dark, so that
they could not see our number; and I made the man they had
left in the boat, who was now one of us, to call them by name,
to try if I could bring them to a parley, and so might perhaps
reduce them to terms; which fell out just as we desired: for,
indeed, it was easy to think, as their condition then was, they
would be willing to capitulate. So he calls out, as loud as he
could, to one of them, Tom Smith! Tom Smith! Tom Smith
answered immediately, Is that Robinson? For it seems, he knew
the voice. The other anwered, Ay, ay; for God’s sake, Tom

Smith again. Here they are, says he; here’s our captain and

and if you do not yield, you are all lost.—Will they give us

and the captain himself then calls out, You, Smith, you know
my voice; if you lay down your arms immediately, ard submit,
you shall have your lives, all but Will Atkins. _

LEAVES THE ISLAND.

and giving him injurious language. However, the captain told
him he must lay down his arms at discretion, and trust to the
governor's mercy: by which he meant me, for they all called me
governor. In a word, they all laid down their arms, and begged
their lives; and I sent the man that had parleyed with them,
and two more, who bound them all; and then my great army of
206 anvaurmms' or
eight, came up and seized upon them, and upon their boat; only
that I kept myself and one more out of sight for reasons of state.
Our next work was to repair the boat, and think of seizing
the ship: and as for the captain, now he had leisure to parley
with them, he expostulated with them upon the villany of their
practices with him, and at length upon the further wickedness
of their design, and how certainly it must bring them to mise
and distress in the end, and perhaps to the gallows. They a
appeared very penitent, and begged hard for their lives. As for
that, he told them they were none of his prisoners, but the com-
mander’s of the island; that they thought they had set him on
shore on a barren, uninhabited island; but it had pleased God
so to direct them, that it was inhabited, and that the governor
was an Englishman; that_he might hang them all there, if he
pleased; but as he had given them all quarter, be supposed he
would send them to England, to be dealt with there as justice
required, except Atkins, whom he was commanded by the gover-
nor to advise to prepare for death, for that he would be hanged
in the morning.

desired effect: Atkins fell upon his knees, to beg the captain to
intercede with the governor for his life; and all the rest begged
of him, for God’s sake, that they might not be sent to England.
It now occurred to me, that the time of our deliverance was
come, and that it would he a most easy thing to bring these
fellows in to be hearty in getting possession of the ship; so I re-
tired in the dark from them, that they might not see what kind
of a governor they had, and called the captain to me: when I
called, as at a good distance, one of the men was ordered to speak
again, and say to the captain, Captain, the commander calls for
you; and presently the captain replied, Tell his excellenc I am
)ust a-coming. This more erfectly amused them, and t ey all
aosmsou Hanson. 207
Upon the captain’s coming to me, I told him my project for
seizing the ship, which he liked wonderfully well, and resolved
to put it in execution the next morning. But, in order to execute
it with more heart, and to be secure of success, I told him we
must divide the prisoners, and that he should go and take Atkins
and two more of the worst of them, and send them pinioned to
the care where the others lay. This was committed to Friday
and the two men who came on shore with the captain. They
conviyed them to the cave as to a prison: and it was, indeed, a
dism place, especially to men in their condition. The others
I ordered to my bower, as I called it, of which I have given a
full description: and as it was fenced in, and they pinioned, the
place was secure enough, considering they were upon their
ehaviour.
To these in the morning I sent the captain, who was to enter
into a parley with them; in a word, to try them, and tell me
whether he thought they might be trusted or no to go on board
and sur rise the ship. He talked to them of the injury done
him, of t e condition they were brought to, and that though the
governor had given them quarter for their lives as to the present
action, yet that if they were sent to England, they would all be
' hanged in chains, to be sure; but that if they would join in so
just an attempt as to recover the ship, he would have the
governor's engagement for their pardon.
Any one may guess how readily such a proposal would be ac-
cepted by men in their condition; they fell down on their knees
to the captain, and promised, with the deepest imprecations, that
they would be faithful to him to the last drop, and that they
should owe their lives to him, and would go with him all over
the world; that they would own him as a father as long as they
lived. Well, says the captain. I must go and tell the governor
what you say, and see what I can do to bring him to consent to
it. So he brought me an account of the temper he found them
in, and that he verily believed the would be faithful. However,
that we might be very secure, I to d him he should go back again

assistants, and that the governor would keep the other two, and
the three that were sent prisoners to the castle (my cave) as

208 anvmraes or
in chains alive on the shore. This looked severe, and convinced
them that the governor was in earnest: however, they had no
way left them but to accept it; and it was now the business of
the prisoners, as much as of the captain, to persuade the other

the captain, his mate, and passenger; second, the two prisoners

I asked the captain if he was willing to venture with these
hands on board the ship: but as for me and my man Friday, I
did not think it was proper for us to stir, having seven men left
behind; and it was employment enough for us to keep them

day to them, to supply them with necessaries; and I made the
other two carry provisions to a certain distance, where Friday
was to take it.
When I showed myself to the two hostages, it was with the
captain, who told them I was the person the governor had ordered
to look after them; and that it was the governor's pleasure the
should not stir any where but by my direction; that if they di ,
they would be fetched into the castle, and be laid in irons: so
that as we never suffered them to see me as a governor, I now
appeared as another person, and spoke of the governor, the gar-
rison, the castle, and the like, upon all occasions.

keep them down that were below ; when the other boat and their
men entering at the fore-chains, secured the forecastle of the ship,
and the scuttle which went down into the cook-room, making
three men they found there prisoners. When this was done, and
all safe upon deck, the captain ordered the mate, with three men,
to break into the round-house, where the new rebel captain lay,
who having taken the alarm, had got up, and with two men and

the new captain through the head, the bullet entering at his
mouth, and came out again behind one of his cars, so that he
never spoke a word more: upon which the rest yielded, and the
ship was taken effectually, without any more lives lost.

As soon as the ship was thus secured, the captain ordered/ViL '0"

to give me notice of his success, which you may be sure I was
very glad to hear, having sat watching upon the shore for it till
near two o’clock in the morning. Having thus heard the signal
plainly, I laid me down ; and it having been a day of great fatigue
to me, I slept very sound, till I was something surprised with
the noise of a gun; and presently starting up, I heard a man call
me by the name of Governor, Governor, and presently I knew
the captain’s voice; when climbing up to the top of the hill, there
he stood, and pointing to the ship, he embraced me in his arms.
My dear friend and deliverer, says he, there’s your ship, for she
is all yours, and so are we, and all that belong to her. I cast
my eyes to the ship, and there she rode within little more than
half a mile of the shore; for they had weighed her anchor as
soon as they were masters of her, and the weather being fair,
had brought her to an anchor just against the mouth of the little
creek; and the tide being up, the captain had brought the pinnace

not able to answer him one word; but as he had taken me in
his arms, I held fast by him, or I should have fallen to the ground.
He perceived the surprise, and immediately pulls a bottle out of
his pocket, and gave me a dram of cordial, which he had brought 1

ground; and though it brought me to myself, yet it was a good
while before I could speak a word to him. All this time the
poor man was in as great an ecstasy as I, only not under any
surprise, as I was; and he said a thousand kind and tender things
to me, to compose and bring me to myself: but such was the

at last it broke out into tears; and in a little while after I re-
covered my speech. I then took my turn, and embraced him as
my deliverer, and we rejoiced together. I told him I looked
upon him as a man sent from Heaven to deliver me, and that the
whole transaction seemed to be a chain of wonders; that such
things as these were the testimonies we had of a secret hand of
providence governing the world, and an evidence that the eye of an

to lift up my heart in thankfulness to Heaven; and what heart
could forbear to bless him, who had not only in a. miraculous
manner provided for me in such a wilderness, and in such a
desolate condition, but from whom every deliverance must always
be acknowledged to proceed?
When we had talked a while, the captain told me he had
brought me some little refreshment, such as the ship afforded,
and such as the wretches that had been so long his masters had
not plundered him of. Upon this he called aloud to the boat,
and bade his men bring the things ashore that were for the
governor; and, indeed, it was apresent as if I had been one that
was not to be carried away with them, but as if I had been to
dwell upon the island still. First, he had brought me a case of
bottles full of excellent cordial waters, six large bottles of Madeira
wine (the bottles held two quarts each), two pounds of excellent
good tobacco, twelve good pieces of the ship's beef, and six pieces
of pork, with a bag of peas, and about a hundred weight of bis-
210 novnnrunrs or
full of lemons, and two bottles of lime juice, and abundance of
other things. But, besides these, and what was a thousand times
more useful to me, he brought me six new clean shirts, six very
good neckcloths, two pair of gloves, one pair of shoes, a hat, and
one pair of stockings,- with a very good suit of clothes of his own,
which had been worn but very little; in a word, he clothed me
from head to foot. It was a very kind and agreeable present, as
any one may imagine, to one in my circumstances; but never was
any thing in the world of that kind so unpleasant. awkwardI md

were brought into my little apartment, we began to consult what
was to be done with the prisoners we had; for it was worth con-
sidering whether we might venture to take them away with us
or no, especially two of them, whom we knew to be incorrigible
and refractory to the last degree; and the captain said he knew
they were such rogues, that there was no obliging them; and if
he did carry them away, it must be in irons, as malefactors, to

about it. Upon this I told him, that if he desired it, I would un-
dertake to bring the two men he spoke of to make it their own
request that he should leave them upon the island. I should be
very glad of that, says the captain, with all my heart.—Well,
says I, I will send for them up, and talk with them for you. So
I caused Friday and the two hostages, for they were now dis-
charged, their comrades having performed their promise; I say,

as they were, to the bower, and keep them there till I came. After
some time, I came thither dressed in my new habit; and now I
was called governor again. Being all met, and the captain with
me, I caused the men to be brought before me, and I told them I
had got a full account of their villanous behaviour to the captain,
and how they had run away with the ship, and were preparing
to commit farther robberies, but that Providence had ensnared
them in their own ways, and that they were fallen into the pit
which they had dug for others. I let them know that by my
direction the ship had been seized; that she lay now in the road;
and they might see, by and by, that their new captain had re-
ceived the reward of his villany, and that they would see him
hanging at the yard-arm: that as to them, I wanted to know what
they had to say why I should not execute them as pirates, taken
in the fact, as by my commission they could not doubt but I had
authority so to do.
One of them answered in the name of the rest, that they had
nothing to say but this, that when they were taken, the captain
promised them their lives, and they humbly implored my mercy.
But I told them I knew not what mercy to show them; for as
for myself, I had resolved to quit the island with all my men,
and had taken passage with the captain to go for England; and
as for the captain, he could not carry them to England other
than as prisoners, in irons, to be tried for mutiny, and running
away with the ship; the consequence of which, they must needs
know, would be the gallows; so that I could not tell what was
best for them, unless they had a mind to take their fate in the
island: if they desired that, as I had liberty to leave the island,
I had some inclination to give them their lives, if they thought
they could shift on shore. They seemed very thankful for it, and
said they would much rather venture to stay there than be car.

things, and desired him to go on board, in the mean time, and keep
all right in the ship, and send the boat on shore next day for me;
ordering him, at all events, to cause the new captain, who was
killed, to be hanged at the yard-arm, that these men might see him.
When the captain was gone, I sent for the men up to me to
my apartment, and entered seriously into discourse with them on~
their circumstances. I told them I thought they had made a
right choice; that if the captain had carried them away, they
would certainly be hanged. I showed them the new captain
hanging at the yard-arm of the ship, and told them they had
nothing less to expect.
When they had all declared their willingness to stay, I then
told them I would let them into the story of my living there, and
put them into the way of making it easy to them : accordingly,
gave them the whole history of the place, and of my coming to

themselves. Here it may be noted, that the captain had ink on
board, who was greatly surprised that I never hit upon a way

two barrels of gunpowder more, and some garden seeds, which
I told them I would have been very glad of: also I gave them

captain, at my intercession, caused their chests and clothes to be
added, which they took, and were very thankful for. I also en-
couraged them, by telling them that if it lay in my power to send
any vessel to take them in, I would not forget them.
When I took leave of this island, I carried on board, for reliques,
the great goat-skin cap I had made, my umbrella, and one of my
parrots; also I forgot not to take the money I formerly men-

ROBINSON GOES TO LISBON, WHERE HE FINDS THE PORTUGUI‘EE
CAPTAIN, WHO RENDERS HIM AN ACCOUNT OF HIS PROPERTY IN
THE BRAZILS.-—SETS OUT ON HIS RETURN TO ENGLAND BY LAND.
WHEN I came to England, I was as perfect a stranger to all the
world as if I had never been known there. My benefactor and
faithful steward, whom I had left my money in trust with, was
alive, but had had great misfortunes in the world; was become
a widow the second time, and very low in the world. I made her
very easy as to what she owed me, assuring her I would give her
no trouble; but on the contrary, in gratitude for former care and
faithfulness to me, I relieved her as my little stock would afford;
which, at that time, would indeed allow me to do but little for
her; but I assured her I would never forget her former kindness

shall be observedin its proper place. I went down afterwards into
Yorkshire: but my father and mother were dead, and all the
family extinct, except that I found two sisters, and two of the
children of one of my brothers; and as I had been long ago given
over for dead, there had been no provision made for me: so that,
in a word, I found nothing to relieve or assist me; and that the
little money I had would not do much for me as to settling in
the world.
I met with one piece of gratitude, indeed, which I did not ex-
pect; and this was, that the master of the ship whom I had so
appily delivered, and by the same means saved the ship and
cargo, having given a very handsome account to the owners of
the manner 11.0w 1 had saved the lives of the men, and the ship,

my life, and how little way this would go towards settling me in
the world, I resolved to go to Lisbon, and see if I might not come
by some information of the state of my plantation in the Brazils,
and of what was become of my partner, who, I had reason to
suppose, had some years past given me over for dead. With this
view [took shipping for Lisbon, where I arrived in April follow-
ing; my man Friday accompanying me very honestly in all these
ramblings, and proving a most faithful servant upon all occasions.
vVhen I came to Lisbon, I found out, by inquiry, and to my par-

took me up at sea off the shore of Africa. He was now grown
old, and had left off going to sea, having put his son, who was
far from a young man, into his ship, and who still used the Brazil
trade. The old man did not know me: and, indeed, I hardly
knew him: but I soon brought him to my remembrance, and as
soon brought myself to his remembrance, when I told him who
I was.
After some passionate expressions of the old acquaintance
between us, I inquired, you may be sure, after my plantation and
my partner. The old man told me he had not been in the Brazils
for about nine years; but that he could assure me that when he
came awaymy partner was living; but the trustees, whom I had
joined wit him to take cognizance of my part, were both dead:
that, however, he believed 1 would have a very good account of
the improvement of the plantation; for that upon the general
belief of my being cast away and drowned, my trustees had given

for the conversion of the Indians to the Catholic faith; but that
if I appeared, or any one for me, to claim the inheritance, it would
be restored; only that the improvement, or annual production,v '
being distributed to charitable uses, could not be restored: b
be assured me that the steward of the king’s revenue from lands,
and the proviedore, or steward of the monastery, had taken great
care all along that the incumbent, that is to say, my partner, gave
every year a faithful account of the produce, of which they had
duly received my moiety. I asked him if he knew to what height
of improvement he had brought the plantation, and whether he
thought it might be worth looking alter; or whether, on my going
thither, I should meet with any obstruction to my possessing my
just right in the moiety. He told me he could not tell exactly
to wha' degree the plantation was improved, but this he knew,
that my partner was grown exceeding rich upon the enJoying his


part of it; and that, to the best of his remembrance, he had heard
that the king’s third of my part, which was, it seems, granted
away to some other monastery or religious house, amounted to
above two hundred moidores a—year: that as to my being
restored to a quiet possession of it, there was no question to be
made of that, my partner being alive to witness my title, and my
name being also enrolled in the register of the country: also he
told me, that the survivors of my two trustees were very fair
honest people, and very wealthy: and he believed I would not
only have their assistance for putting me in possession, but would

the trust, and before it was given up, as above; which, as he
remembered, was for about twelve years.
I showed myself alittle concerned and uneasy at this account,
and inquired of the 01d captain how it came to pass that the
trustees should thus dispose of my effects, when he knew that I
had made m will, and had made him, the Portuguese captain,
my universe heir, &c.
He told me that was true ; but that as there was no proof of
my being dead, he could not act as executor, until some certain
account should come of my death; and, besides, he was not
willing to intermeddle with a thing so remote : that it was true
he had registered my will, and put in his claim; and could he
have given any account of my being dead or alive, he would
have acted by procuration, and taken possession of the ingenio
(so they called the sugar-house), and have given his son, who was
now at the Brazils, orders to do it. But, says the old man, I
have one piece of news to tell you, which, perhaps, may not be so
acceptable to you as the rest; and that is, believing you were
lost, and all‘the world behaving so also, your partner and trustees
did offer to account with me, in your name, for six or eight of

have disposed of it. I

let _me see that he was debtor to me four hundred and seventy
216 ADVENTURES or
rolls of tobacco, which were lost in his ship; he having been
shipwrecked coming home to Lisbon, about eleven years after
my leaving the place. The good man then began to complain of
his misfortunes, and how he had been obliged to make use of my
money to recover his losses, and buy him a share in a new ship.

writings of his title to the ship, which his son was gone to the
Brazils in, of which he was a quarter part owner, and his son
another, he puts them both into my hands, for security of the
rest. _ .
I was too much moved with the honesty and kindness of the
poor man to be able to bear this; and remembering what he had
done for me, how he had taken me up at sea, and how generously
he had used me on all occaslons, and particularly how sincere a
friend he was now to me, I could hardly refrain weeping at what
he had said to me; thereforel asked him if his circumstances
admitted him to spare so much money at that time, and if it
would not straiten him? He told me he could not say but it
might straiten him a little; but, however, it was my money, and
I might want it more than he.

hardly refrain from tears while he spoke; in short, I took one

ever I had possession of the plantation, I would return the other
to him also (as, indeed, I afterwards did) ; and that as to the bill
of sale of his part in his son’s ship, I would not take it by any
means : but that if I wanted the money, I found he was honest
enough to pay me; and if I did not, but came to receive what he
gave me reason to expect, I would never have a penny more
rom him.
When this was past, the old man asked me if he should put
me into a method to make my claim to my plantation? I told
him I thought to go over to it myself. He said I might do so, if
I pleased; but that if I did not, there were ways enough to

the place ; and then proposed my staying with him till an account
mine of the return.
Never was anything more honourable than the lt'oceedingl
upon this procuration; for in less than seven months I received
a large packet from the survivorsof my trustees, the merchants,
for whose account I went to sea, in which were the following
particular letters and papers enclosed.
First, There was the account-current of the produce of my
farm or plantation, from the year when their fathers had balanced
with my old Portugal captain, being for six years: tne balance
appeared to be one thousand one hundred and seventy-four
moidores in my favour.
Secondly, There was the account of four years more, while they
kept the effects in their hands, before the government claimed
the administration, as being the effects of a person not to be
found, which they called civil death ; and the balance of this, the
value of the plantation increasing, amounted to nineteen thou-
sand four hundred and forty-six crusadoes, being about three
thousand two hundred and forty moidores.
Thirdly, There was the prior of Augustine's account, who had
2i8 ADVENTURES or

declared he had eight hundred and seventy-two moidores not
distributed, which he acknowledged to my account: as to the
king's part, that refunded nothing.
There was aletter of my partner’s, congratulating me very
affectionately upon my being alive, giving me an account how the
estate was improved, and what it produced a year; with a par-
ticular of the number of squares or acres that it contained, how
planted, how many slaves there were upon it, and making two
and twenty crosses for blessings, told me he had said so many Ave
Maria: to thank the blessed Virgin that I was alive; inviting me
very passionately to come over and take possession of my own;
and, in the mean time, to give him orders to whom he should
deliver my effects, if I did not come myself; concluding with a
hearty tender of his friendship, and that of his family; and sent

I requited my old man.
I was now to consider which way to steer my course next, ans
what to do with the estate that Providence had thus put into my
hands; and, indeed, I had more care upon my head now than I
Ihad in my silent state of life in the island, where I wanted
nothing but what I had, and had nothing but what I wanted;
whereas I had now a great charge upon me, and my business was
how to secure it. I had never a cave now to hide my money in, or
a place where it might lie without lock or key, till it grew mouldy
and tarnished, before any body would meddle with it; on the
contrary, I knew not where to put it, or whom to trust with it.
My old patron, the captain, indeed, was honest, and that was the
only refuge I had. In the next place, my interest in the Brazils
seemed to summon me thither; ut now I could not tell how to

I knew, might be in debt: so that, in a word, I had no way but
to go back to England myself, and take my effects with me.
It was some months, however, before I resolved upon this;
and, therefore, as I had rewarded the old captain fully, and to
his satisfaction, who had been my former benefactor, so I began

for me, and to talk with her, and comfort her in her poverty, by
telling her she should, if I lived, have a further supply: at the
same tlme I sent my two sisters in the country a hundred pounds
each, they being, though not in want, yet not in very good cir-
cumstances; one having been married and left a widow; and the
other having a husband not so kind to her as he should be. But
among all my relations or acquaintances, I could not yet pitch upon
one to whom I durst commit the gross of my stock, that I might
go away to the Brazils, and leave things safe behind me; and
this greatly perplexed me.
I had once a mind to have gone to the Brazils, and have set-
tled myself there; for I was, as it were, naturalized to the place;
but I had some little scruple in my mind about religion, which
insensibly drew me back. However, it was not religion that kept
me from goingthere for the present; and as I had made no scruple
of being openly of the religion of the country all the while I was
among them, so neither did I yet; only that, now and then,
having of late thought more of it than formerly, when I began to
think of living and dying among them, [began to regret my
having professed myself a papist, and thought it might not be
the best religion to die with. '
But, as I have said, this was not the main thing that kept me
from going to the Brazils, but that really I did not know with
whom to leave my effects behind me: so I resolved, at last, to
go to England with it, where, if I arrived, I concluded I should

for; as for sending them any present, they were far above having
any occasion for it. Lastly, I wrote to my partner, acknowledg-
ing his industry in the improving the plantation, and his integrity
inincreasing the stock of the works; giving him instructions for
his future government of my part, according to the powers I had
left with my old patron, to whom I desired him to send whatever _
became due to me, till he should hear from me more particularly;
assuring him that it was my intention not only to come to him,
but to settle myself there for the remainder of my life. To this
I added a very handsome present of some Italian silks for his

shipped my baggage, in order to go, yet I altered my mind, and
that not once, but two or three times.
It is true, I had been very unfortunate by sea, and this might
be some of the reasons ; but let no man slight the strong impulses
of his own thoughts in cases of such moment: two of the ships
which I had singled out to go in, I mean more particularly singled
out than any other, having put my things on board one of them,
and in the other to have agreed with the captain; I say, two of
these ships miscarried, viz. one was taken by the Algerines, and
the other was cast away on the Start, near Torbay, and all the
people drowned, except three; so that in either of those vessels
I had been made miserable.
Having been thus harassed in my thoughts, my old pilot, to
whom I communicated every thing, pressed me earnestly not to
go by sea, but either to go by land to the Groyne (Corunna), and
cross over the Bay of Biscay to Rochelle, from whence it was
but an easy and safe journey by land to Paris, and so to Calais
and Dover; or to go up to Madrid, and so all the way by land
through France. In a word, I was so prepossessed against my
going by sea at all, except from Calais to Dover, that I resolved
to travel all the way by land; which, as I was not in haste, and
did not value the charge, was by much the pleasanter way : and
to make it more so, my old captain brought an English gentle-
man, the son of a merchant in Lisbon, who was willing to travel
with me; after which we picked up two more English merchants
also, and two young Portuguese gentlemen, the last going to

the two merchants and the two Portuguese contenting themselves
with one servant between two, to save the charge; and as for me,
I got an English sailor to travel with me as a servant, besides
my man Friday, who was too much a stranger to be capable of
supplying the place of a servant on the road.
In this mannerI set out from Lisbon; and our company being
very well mounted and armed, we made a little troop, whereof
they did me the honour to call me captain, as well because I was
the oldest man, as because I had two servants, and. indeed, was
the original of the whole journey.
As I have troubled you with none of my sea journals, sol
shall trouble you now with none of my land journal; but some
222 ADVENTURES or
journey I must not omit.
When we came to Madrid, we being all of us strangers to Spain,
were willing to stay some time to see the court of Spain, and to
see what was worth observing; but it being the latter part of the
summer, we hastened away, and set out from Madrid about the
middle of October; but when we came to the edge of Navarre,
we were alarmed, at several towns on the way, with an account
that so much snow was fallen on 'the French side of the moun-
tains, that several travellers were obliged to come back to Pam-
peluna, after having attempted, at an extreme hazard, to pass on.
When we came to Pampeluua itself, we found it so, indeed; and
to me, that had been always used to a hot climate, and to countries
where I could scarce bear any clothes on, the cold was insuffer-
able: nor, indeed, was it more painful than surprising, to come
but ten days before out of Old Castile, where the weather was
not only warm, but very hot, and immediately to feel a wind
from the Pyrenean mountains, so very keen, so severely cold, as
to be intolerable, and to endanger the benumbing and perishing
222 ADVENTURES or
Poor Friday was really frightened when he saw the mountains
all covered with snow, and felt cold weather, which he had never
seen or felt before in his life. To mend the matter, when we"
came to Pampeluna, it continued snowing with so much violence,
and so long, that the people said winter was come before its
222 ADVENTURES or
impassable; for, in a word, the snow lay in some places too
thick for us to travel, and being not hard frozen, as is the case
in the northern countries, there was no going without being in
danger of being buried alive every step. We stayed no less than
twenty days at Pampeluna; when seeing the wmter coming on,
and no likelihood of its being better, for it was the severest wmter
all overEurope that had been known in the memory ofman,l pro-
posed that we should all go away to Fontarabia, and there take
shipping for Bourdeaux. which was a very little voyage. But
while I was considering this, there came in four French gentle-
men, who having been stopped on the French side of the passes,
as we were on the Spanish, had found out a guide, who, traversing
the country near the head of Languedoc, had brought them over
the mountains by such ways, that they were not much incom~
moded with the snow; for where they met with snow in any
uantity, they said it was frozen hard enough to hear them and
t eir horses. We sent for this guide, who told us he would un-
dertake to carry us the same way with no hazard from the snow,

wild beasts; for, he said, upon these great snows it was frequent
for some wolves to show themselves at the foot of the mountains,
being made ravenous for want of food, the ground being covered
with snow. We told him we were well enough prepared for such
creatures as they were, if he would insure us from a kind of two-
legged wolves, which, we were told, we were in most danger
from, especially on the French side of the mountains. He satis-

were to go : so we readily agreed to follow him, as did also twelve
other gentlemen, with their servants, some French, some Spanish,
who, as I said, had attempted to go, and were obliged to come
back again. '
Accordingly, we set out from Pampeluna, with our guide, on
the 15th of November; and, indeed, I was surprised, when, instead
of going forward, he came directly back with us on the same road
that we came from Madrid, about twenty miles; when having
passed two rivers, and come into the plain country, we found
ourselves in a warm climate again, where the country was
pleasant, and no snow to be seen; but on a sudden turning to
's left, he approached the mountains another way: and though
it is true the hills and precipices looked dreadful, yet he made so
many tours, such meanders, and led us by such winding ways,
that we insensibly passed the height of the mountains without
being much incumbered with the snow; and, all on a sudden, he
showed us the pleasant fruitful provinces of Languedoc and

distance, and we had some rough way to pass still.
We were a little uneasy, however, when we found it snowed
one whole day and a night so fast, that we could not travel; but
he bidus be easy; we should soon be past it all: we found, indeed,
that we began to descend every day, and to come more north than
before; and s0,( spending upon our guide, we went on.

SECTION XXIX
FRIDAY'S ENCOUNTER WITH A BEAR..—-ROBINSON AND HIS FELLOW
TRAVELLERS ATTACKED BY A FLOCK OF WOLVES.—HIS ARRANGE-
MENT OF HIS AFFAIRS, AND MARRIAGE AFTER. I-IIS RETURN TO
ENGLAND.
IT was about two hours before night, when our guide being some-
thing before us, and not just in sight, out rushed three monstrous
wolves, and after them a bear, out of a hollow way, adjoining to
a thick wood; two of the wolves made at the guide, and had he
been far before us, he would have been devoured before we could
have helped him; one of them fastened upon his horse, and the
other attacked the man with that violence, that he had not time,
or presence of mind enough, to draw his pistol, but hallooed and
cried out to us most lustily. My man Friday being next me, I
bade him ride 11 , and see what was the matter. As soon as
Friday came in sight of the man, he hallooed out as loud as the
other, 0 master! 0 master! but, like a bold fellow, rode directly
up to the poor man, and with his pistol shot the wolf, that at-
tacked him, in the head.
It was happy for the poor man that it was my man Friday;
for he having been used to such creatures in his country, he had
no fear respecting them, but went close up to him and shot him,

indeed, it alarmed all our company, when, with the noise of
Friday’s pistol, we heard on both sides the most dismal howling
of wolves ; and the noise, redoubled by the echo of the mountains,
appeared to us as if there had been a prodigious number of them;
and, perhaps, there was not such a few as that we had no cause
of apprehensions: however, as Friday had killed this wolf, the
other that had fastened upon the horse left him immediately, and

upon his head, where the bosies of the bridle had stuck in his
teeth. But the man was most hurt; for the raging creature had
hit him twice, once in the arm, and the other time a little above
his knee; and though he had made some defence, he was just as
It were tumbling down by the disorder of his horse, when Friday
came up and shot the wolf.
It is easy to suppose that at the noise of Friday’s pistol we all
mended our pace, and rode up as fast as the way, which was very

soon as we came clear of the trees, which blinded us before, we
saw clearly what had been the case, and how Friday had disen-

is a heavy, clumsy creature, and does not gallop as the wolf does,

not his proper prey (he does not usually attempt them, except

with you: but then you must take care to be very civil to him,
and give him the road, for he is a very nice gentleman; he will
not go a step out of his way for a prince; nay, if you are really
afraid, your best way is to 100k another way, and keep going
on; for sometimes if you stop, and stand still, and look stead-

My man Friday had delivered our guide, and when we came
up to him, he was helping him off from his horse, for the man
Ins both hurt and frightened, when, on a sudden, we espied the
bear come out of the wood, and a vast, monstrous one it Was,
the biggest by far that everI saw. We were all a little surprised
when we saw him; but when Friday saw him, it was easy to see
ioy and courage in the fellow’s countenance; O, O, 0! says Friday,
three times, pointing to him; 0 master! you give me te leave,
me shakee te hand with him; me makee you good laugh.
I was surprised to see the fellow so well pleased: You fool,
says I, he will eat you up.—Eatee me up! eatee me up! says
Friday, twice over again; me eatee him up; me makee you good
laugh: you all stay here, me show you good laugh. So down he
sits, and gets off his boots in a moment, and puts on a pair of

The bear was walking softly on, and offered to meddle with
nobody, till Friday coming pretty near, calls to him, as if the
bear could understand him, Hark ye, hark ye, says Friday, me
speakee with you. We followed at a distance; for now being
come down on the Gascony side of the mountains, we were eni—
tered a vast great forest, where the country was plain and pretty
open, though it had many trees in it scattered here and there.
Friday, who had, as we say, the heels of the bear, came up with
him quickly, and takes up a great stone and throws it at him,
and hit him just on the head, but did him no more harm than if
he had thrown it against a wall; but it answered Friday’s end,
for the rogue was so void of fear that he did it purely to make
the bear follow him, and show us some laugh as he called it. As
soon as the bear felt the blow, and saw him, he turns about, and

a strange rate, such as would have put a horse to a middling

deliver my man; though I was angry at him heartily for bring-

business another way; and especially I was angry that he had
turned the bear upon us, and then run away; and I called out,
You dog, is this your making us laugh? Come away, and take
your horse, that we may shoot the creature. He heard me, and
cried out, No shoot, no shoot; stand still, and you get much
laugh; and as the nimble creature ran two feet for the bear's one,
he turned on a sudden, on one side of us, and seeing a great oak
226 , ADVENTURES or
ling his pace, he gets nimbly up the tree, laying his gun down
226 , ADVENTURES or
the tree. The bear soon came to the tree, and we followed at a
226 , ADVENTURES or
it, but let it lie, and up he scrambles into the tree, climbing like
a cat, though so monstrous heavy. I was amazed at the folly,
is I thought it, of my man, and could not f0: my life see anv
thing to laugh at yet, till seeing the bear get up the tree, we all
rode near to him.
When we came to the tree, there was Friday got out to the
small end of a large branch, and the bear got about half way to
him. As soon as the bear got out to that part where the lime
of the tree was weaker,—Ha! says he to us, now you see me
teachee the bear dance: so he falls a jumping and shaking the
bough, at which the bear began to totter, but stood still, and
began to look behind him, to see how he should get back; then,
indeed, we did laugh heartily. But Friday had not done with
him by a great deal; when seeing him stand still, he calls out to
him again, as if he had supposed the bear could speak English,
What, you come no farther? pray you come farther: so he left
jumping and shaking the tree; and the bear, just as ifhe under-
stood what he said, did come a little farther; then he fell a
jumping again, and the bear stopped again. We thought now
was a good time to knock him on the head, and called to Friday
to stand still, and we would shoot the bear: but he cried out
earnestly, O pray! O pray! no shoot, me shoot by and then; he
would have said by and by. However, to shorten the story,
Friday danced so much, and the bear stood so ticklish, that we
had laughing enough, but still could not imagine what the fellow
aonmsor: CRUSOE. 227
off; and we found the hear was too cunning for that too; for he
would not go out far enough to be thrown down, but clings fast
with his great broad claws and feet, so that we could not imagine
what would be the end of it, and what the jest would be at last.
But Friday puts us out of doubt quickly for seeing the bear
cling fast to the bough, and that he would not be persuaded to
come any farther, Well, well, says Friday, you no come farther,
me go; you no come to me, me come to you : and upon this, he
goes out to the smaller end of the bough, where it would bend
with his weight, and gently lets himself down by it, sliding down
the bough, till he came near enough to jump down on his feet,
and away he runs to his gun, takes it up, and stands still. Well,
said I to him, Friday, what will you do now? Why don’t you
shoot him’l—No shoot, says Friday, no yet; me no shoot now,
me no kill; me stay, give you one more laugh; and, indeed, so
he did, as you will see presently: for when the bear saw his
enemy gone, he comes back from the bough where he stood, but
did it mighty cautiously, looking behind him every step, and
coming backward till he got into the body of the tree; then, with
the same hinder-end foremost, he came down the tree, grasping it
with his claws, and moving one foot at a time, very leisurely.
At this juncture, and just before he could set his hind-foot on
the ground, Friday stepped up close to him, clapped the muzzle
of his piece into his ear, and shot him dead. Then the rogue
228 nova-moans or
turned about, to see if we did not laugh; and when he saw we
were pleased, by our looks, he falls a laughing himself very loud.
So we kill bear in my country, says Friday. So you kill them?
. says I: why you have no guns—No, says he, no gun, but shoot
great much long arrow. This was a'good diversion to us; but
we were still in a wild place, and our guide very much hurt, and
what to do we hardly knew: the bowling of wolves run much in
my head; and, indeed, except the noise I once heard on the shore
of Africa, of which I have said something already, I never heard
228 nova-moans or
These things, and the approach of night, called us off, or else,
as Friday would have had us, we should certainly have taken
the skin of this monstrous creature off, which was worth saving;
but we had near three leagues to go, and our guide hastened us,
so we left him, and went forward on our journey.
The ground was still covered with snow, though not so deep
and dangerous as on the mountains; and the ravenous creatures,
as we heard afterwards, were come down into the forest and plain
countr , pressed by hunger, to seek for food, and had done a
great eal of mischief in the villages, where they surprised the
country people, killed a great many of their sheep and horses,
and some peo le too. We had one dangerous place to pass, of
which our gui e told us, if there were more wolves in the country
228 nova-moans or
228 nova-moans or
lane, which we were to pass to get through the wood, and then
we should come to the village where we were to lodge. It was
228 nova-moans or
and a little after sunset when we came into the plain. We met
228 nova-moans or
228 nova-moans or
great wolves cross the road, full speed one after another, as if
they had been in chase of some prey, and had it in view; they
took no notice of us, and were gone out of sight in a few moments.
Upon this our guide, who, by the way, was but a faint-hearted
fellow, bid us keep in a ready posture, for he believed there were
more wolves a-coming. We kept our arms ready, and our e es
about us; but we saw no more wolves till we came through t at
wood, which was near half a league, and entered the plain. As
soon as we came into the plain, we had occasion enough to look
228 nova-moans or
to say, a poor horse which the wolves had killed, and at least a
dozen of them at work, we could not say eating of him, but pick-

but I would not suffer him by any means; for I found we were
hke to have more business upon our hands than we were liwan
of. We were not gone half over the plain, when we began to hear
the wolves bowl in the wood on our left in a frightful manner,
and presently after we saw about a hundred coming on directly
towards us, all in a body, and most of them in-a line, as regularly
aonmson causes. 229
in what manner to receive them, but found to draw ourselves in
a close line was the only way: so we formed in a moment: but
that we might not have too much interval, I ordered that only

notion not altogether mistaken; for upon our shout, they began

went to the woods. This gave us leisure to charge our pieces
again; and that we might lose no time, we kept going; but we
had but little more than loaded our fusees, and put ourselves in
readiness, when we heard a terrible noise in the same wood, on
our left, only that it was farther onward, the same way we were
to go.
The night was coming on, and the light began to be dusky,
which made it worse on our side; but the noise increasing. we
could easily perceive that it was the howling and yelling of those
hellish creatures; and on a sudden we perceived two or three
troops of wolves, one on our left, one behind us, and one in our
front, so that we seemed to be surroimded with them: however,
as they did not fall upon us, we kept our way forward, as fast as
we could make our horses go, which, the way being very rough,
was only a good hard trot. In this manner we came in view of
the entrance of the wood, through which we were to pass, at the
farther side of the plain; but we were greatly surprised, when,
coming nearer the lane or pass, we saw a confused number of
wolves standing just at the entrance. On a sudden, at another
opening of a wood, we heard the noise of a gun, and looking
that way out rushed a horse, with a saddle and a bridle on him
aonmson causes. 229
run speed; indeed, the horse had the heels of them, but as we
supposed that he could not hold it at that rate, we doubted not
but they would get up with him at last; no question but they did.
But here we had a most horrible sight; for riding up to the
entrance where the horse came out, we found the carcasses of
another horse and of two men, devoured by the ravenous crea-
tures; and one of the men was no doubt the same whom we heard
230 ADVENTURES or
the man, his head and the upper part of his body were eaten up.
230 ADVENTURES or
but the creatures resolved us soon, for they gathered about us
presently, in hopes of prey; and I verily believe there were three
hundred of them. It happened very much to our advantage, that
at the entrance into the wood, but a little way from it, there lay
some large timber trees, which had been cut down the summer
before, and I suppose lay there for carriage. I drew my little
troop in among those trees, and placing ourselves in a line behind
one long tree, I advised them all to alight, and keeping that tree
before us for a breastwork, to stand in a triangle or three fronts
enclosing our horses in the centre. We did so, and it was well
we did; for never was a more furious charge than the creatures
made upon us in this place. They came on with a growling
kind of noise, and mounted the piece of timber, which, as I said,
was our breastwork. as if they were only rushing upon their
rey; and this fury of theirs, it seems, was principally occasioned

they stopped a little, and I hoped they would have gone off; but
230 ADVENTURES or
230 ADVENTURES or
had killed seventeen or eighteen of them, and lamed twice as
many. yet they came on again. I was loth to spend our shot
too hastily; so I called my servant, not my man Friday, for he
was better employed, for, with the greatest dexterity imaginable,
he had charged my fusee and his own while we were engaged:
but as I said, I called my other man, and giving him a horn of
owder, l bade him lay a train all along the piece of timber, and
at it be a large train. He did so; and had but just time to get
away, when the wolves came up to it, and some got upon it, when
230 ADVENTURES or

or seven of them fell or rather jumped in among us, with the

off in one volley, and after that we gave a Shout: upon this the
wolves turned tail, and we sallied immediately upon near twenty
lame ones, that we found struggling on the ground, and fell a
cutting them with our swords, which answered our expectation;
for the crying and howling they made was better understood by
their fellows; so that they all tied and left us.-
ROBINSON causos. 231
ROBINSON causos. 231
being thus cleared, we made forward again, for we had still near
a league to go. We heard the ravenous creatures bowl and yell
in the woods as we went, several times, and sometimes we fancied
we saw some of them, but the snow dazzling our eyes, we were
not certain: in about an hour more we came to the town where
we were to lodge, which we found in a terrible fright, and all in
arms ; for, it seems, the night before. the wolves and some bears
had broke into the village, and put them in such terror, that they
were obliged to keep guard night and day, but especially in the
night, to preserve their cattle, and, indeed, their people.
The next morning our guide was so ill, and his limbs swelled
so much with the rankling of his two wounds, that he could go
no farther; so we were obliged to take a. new guide here, and go
to Thoulouse, where we found a warm climate, a fruitful pleasant
country, and no snow, no wolves, nor anything like them ; but
when we told our story at Thoulouse, they told us it was nothing
but what what was ordinary in the great forest at the foot of the
mountains, especially when the snow lay on the ground; but
they inquired much what kind of a guide we had got, who would
venture to bring us that way in such a severe season ; and told
us it was surprising we were not all devoured. When we told
them how we placed ourselves, and the horses in the middle, they

been all destroyed; for it was the sight of the horses which made
the wolves so furious, seeing their prey: and that, at other
times, they are really afraid ofa gun; but being excessive hun-
gry, and raging on that account, the eagerness to come at the
horses had made them senseless of danger; and that if we had

we had been torn to pieces: whereas, had we been content to

not have taken the horses so much for their own, when men were
on their backs, as otherwise; and withal they told us, that, at
last, if we had stood altogether, and left our horses, they would
have been so eager to have devoured them, that we might havt

Wing so many in number. For my nart. I was never so sensible
of danger in my life; for seeing above three hundred devils come
roaring and open-mouthed to devour us, and having nothing to
lhelter us, or retreat to, I gave my self over for lost; and, as it
was, I believe I shall never care to cross those mountains again:
I think I would much rather go a thousand leagues by sea,
though I was sure to meet with a storm once a week.
I have nothing uncommon to take notice of in my passage
through France, nothing but what other travellers have given an
account of, with much more advantage than I can. I travelled
from Thoulouse to Paris, and without any considerable stay came
to Calais, and landed safe at Dover, the 14th of January, after
having a severe cold season to travel in.
I was now come to the centre of my travels, and had in a little
time all my new discovered estate safe about me; the bills of
exchange which I brought with me having been very currently
aid.
p My principal guide and privy counsellor was my good ancient
widow; who, in gratitude for the money I had sent her, thought
no pains too much, nor care too great, to employ for me; and
I trusted her so entirely with everything, that I was perfectly
easy as to the security of my effects: and, indeed, I was very
happy from the beginning, and now to the end, in the unspotted
integrity of this good gentlewoman.
I now resolved to dispose of my plantation in the Brazils, if I

of my trustees, who lived in the Brazils, they accepted the offer,
and 10mitted thirty-three thousand pieces of eight to a corre-

instrument of sale, and sent it to my old friend, he remitted me
bills of exchange for thirty-two thousand eight hundred pieces of
eight for the estate, reserving the payment of ahundred moidores
232 ' ADVENTURES or
his son for life, which I had promised them. '
Though I had sold my estate in the Brazils, yet I could not
keep the country out of my head; nor could I resist the strong
inclination I had to see my island. My true friend, the widow,
earnestly dissuaded me from it, and so far prevailed with me, that,
for almost seven years, she prevented my running abroad; during
which time I took my two nephews, the children of one of my
brothers, into my care: the eldest having something of his own,
I bred up as a gentleman, and gave him a settlement of some
addition to his estate, after my decease. The other I put out to

tunity prevailed, and engaged me to go in his ship as a private
trader to the East Indies: this was in the year 1694.
But these things, with some very surprising incidents in some

might be allowed me to have had experience of every state of

part be fully evacuated, or at least condensed, and I might, at
sixty-one years of age, have been a little inclined to stay at home,
and have done venturing life and fortune any more.

taken away in me; for I had no fortune to make; I had nothing

great family, I could not spend the income of what I had, unless
I would set up for an expensive way of living, such as a great
family, servants, equipage, gaiety, and the like, which were
things I had no notion of, or inclination to; so that I had nothing
indeed to do but to sit still, and fully enjoy what I had got, and
see it increase daily upon my hands. Yet all these things had no
effect upon me, or at least not enough to resist the strong incli-
nation I had to go abroad again, which hung about me like a
chronical distemper. In particular, the desire of seeing my new
plantation in the island, and the colony I left there, ran in my
head continually. I dreamed of it all night, and my imagination
ran upon it all day; it was uppermost in all my thoughts; and
my fancy worked so steadily and strongly upon it, that I talked
of it in my sleep; in short, nothing could remove it out of my
mind: it even broke so violently into all my discourses, that it
made my conversation tiresome, for I could talk of nothing else:
all my discourse ran into it, even to impertinence; and I saw it
in myself.

HE IS SElZEI) WITH A DESIRE TO REVISIT HIS ISLAND—LOSE
HIS \Vlr‘E—IS TEMPTED TO GO TO SEA AGAIN——TAKES OUT A
CARGO FOR HIS COLONY.
I HAVE often heard persons of good judgment say, that all the
stir people make in the world about ghosts and apparitions is
owing to the strength of imagination, and the powerful operation
of fancy in their minds ; that there is no such thing as a spirit
appearing, or a ghost walking, and the like : that people's porim7
affectionately upon the past conversation of their deceased
friends, so realises it to them, that they are capable of fancying,
upon some extraordinary circumstances, that they see them,
talk to them, and are answered by them, when, in truth, there is
nothing but shadow and vapour in the thing, and they really
know nothing of the matter.
For my part, I know not to this hour whether there are any
such things as real apparitions, spectres, or walking of people
after they are dead: or whether there is anything in the stories
they tell us of that kind, more than the product of vapours, sick
minds, and wandering fancies : but this I know, that my imagi-
nation worked up to such a height, and brought me into such
excess of vapours, or what else I may call it, that I actually
supposed myself often upon the spot, at my old castle. behind
the trees; saw my old Spaniard, Friday's father, and the repro-
bate sailors I left upon the island; nay, I fancied I talked with
them, and looked at them steadily, though I was broad awake,
as at persons Just before me: and this I did till I often frightened
myself with the images my fancy represented to me. One time,
in my sleep, I had the villany of the three pirate sailors so lively
ROBINSON CItUSOE- "1 5
was surprising: they told me how they barbarously attempted
ROBINSON CItUSOE- "1 5
visions they had laid up, on purpose to distress and starve them;
things that I had never heard of, and that indeed were never all
of them true in fact ; but it was so warm in my imagination, and
so realised to me, that, to the hour I saw them, I could not be
persuaded but that it was, or would be, true: also how I resented
it, when the Spaniard complained to me; and how I brought
them to justice, tried them before me, and ordered them all three
to be hanged. What there was really in this shall be seen in its
place: for however I came to form such things in my dream,
and what secret converse of spirits injected it, yet there was, I say,
much of it true. I own, that this dream had nothing in it literally
ROBINSON CItUSOE- "1 5
villanous behaviour of these three hardened rogues was such.
and had been so much worse than all I can describe, that the
dream had too much similitude of the fact; and as I would after-
wards have punished them severely, so, if I had hanged them
all, I had been much in the right, and even should have been jus-

story. In this kind of temper I lived some years; I had no en-
joyment of my life, no pleasant hours, no agreeable diversion,
but what had something or other of this in it; so that my wife,
who saw my mind wholly bent upon it, told me very seriously
one night, that she believed there was some secret powerful
impulse of Providence upon me, which had determined me to go
thither again; and that she found nothing hindered my going,
but my being engaged to a wife and children. She told me, that
it was true she could not think of parting with me; but as she
ROBINSON CItUSOE- "1 5
would do, so, as it seemed to her that the thing was determined
above, she would not be the only obstruction; for, if I thought

her words, and that I looked very earnestly at her, so that it a
little disordered her, and she stopped. I asked her, why she did
not go on, and say out what she was going to say? But I per
ceived that her heart was too full, and some tears stood in he:
e es. Speak out, my dear, said I ; are you willing I should go?
0, says she, very affectionately, 1 am far from willing; but if
you are resolved to go, says she, and rather than I would be the
only hinderance, I will go with you: for though I think it a most
preposterous thing for one of your years, and in your condition,
yet, if it must be, said she, again weeping, I would not leave
you; for if it be of Heaven, you must do it; there is no resisting
it: and if Heaven make it your duty to go, he will also make it
B

mine to go with you, or otherwise dispose of me, that I may not
obstruct it.
This affectionate behaviour of my wife’s brought me a little out
of the vapours, and I began to consider what I was doing: I
corrected my wandering fancy, and began to argue witl myself
sedately, what business I had, after threescore years, and after
such a life of tedious sufferings and disasters, and closed in so
happy and easy a manner; I say, what business had I to rush
23" ADVENTURES 01'
youth and poverty to run into?
With those thoughts I considered my new engagement; that I
had a wife, one child born, and my wife then great with child of
another; that I had all the world could give me, and had no need
to seek hazard for gain; that I was declining in years, and ought
to think rather of leaving what I had gained, than of seeking to
increase it ; that as to what my wife had said of its being an im-
pulse from Heaven, and that it should be my duty to go, I had
no notion of that: so, after many of these cogitations, I struggled
with the power of my imagination, reasoned myself out of it, as
I believe people may always do in like cases if they will : and,
in a word, I conquered it; composed myself with such arguments
as occurred to my thoughts, and which my present condition
furnished me plentifully with; and particularly, as the most
23" ADVENTURES 01'
and to engage in some business that might effectually tie me up
from any more excursions of this kind; for I found that thing
23" ADVENTURES 01'
nor anything of moment immediately before me. To this purpose
I bought a little farm in the county of Bedford, and resolved to
remove myself thither. I had a little convenient house upon it;
and the land about it, I found, was capable of great improvement;
and it was many ways suited to my inclination, which delighted
in cultivating, managing, planting, and improving of land; and
particularly, bein an inland country, I was removed from con-
versing among sav ors, and things relating to the remote parts of
the world.
In a word, I went down to my farm, settled my family, bought
me ploughs, harrows, a cart, waggon, horses, cows, and sheep,
and setting seriously to work, became, in one half year, a mere
country gentleman: my thoughts were entirely taken up in
managing my servants, cultivating the ground, enclosing, p ant-
ing, &c.; and I lived, as I thought, the most agreeable life that
nature was capable of directing, or that a man always bred to
misfortunes was capable of retreating to.
1 I farmed upon my own land; I had no rent to pay, was limited
by no articles ; I could pull up or cut down as I pleased; what
I planted was for myself, and what I improved was for my famil ;
and having thus left off the thoughts of wandering, 1 had not e
east discomfort in any part of life as to this world. Now I
thought indeed that I enjoyed the middle state of life which my
father so earnestly recommended to me, and lived a k'md of
heavenly life, something like what is described by the poet, upon
the subJect of a country life-

Free from vices, free from care,
Age has no pain, and youth no snare."
But, in the middle of all this felicity, one blow from unseen
Providence unhinged me at once; and not only made a breach
upon me inevitable and incurable, but drove me, by its conse-
quences, into a deep relapse of the wandering disposition, which,
as I may say, being born in my very blood, soon recovered its
hold of me, and, like the returns of a violent distemper, came on
with an irresistible force upon me, so that nothing could make
any more impression upon me. This blow was the loss of my
wife. It is not my business here to write an ele y upon my
wife, give a character of her particular virtues, and make my
ROBINSON causes. 237
in a few words, the stay of all my affairs, the centre of all my
enterprises, the engine that, by her prudence, reduced me to that
happy compass l was in, from the most extravagant and ruinous
ROBINSON causes. 237
my rambling genius than a mother’s tears, a father's instructions,
a friend’s counsel, or all my own reasoning owers, could do. I
was happy in listening to her tears, and in eing moved by her
entreaties; and to the last degree desolate and dislocated in
the World by the loss of her.‘
When she was gone, the world looked awkwardly round me.
I was as much a stranger in it, in my thoughts, as I was in the
ROBINSON causes. 237
except as to the assistance of servants, as I was in my island. I
knew neither what to think nor what to do. I saw the world
busy around me: one part labouring for bread, another part
squandering in vile excesses or empty pleasures. equally mis-
ROBINSON causes. 237
the men of pleasure every ay surfeited of their vice, and heaped
up work for sorrow and repentance ; and the men of labour spent
their strength in daily struggling for bread to maintain the vital
strength they laboured with : so living in a daily circulation or
sorrow. living but to work, and working but to live, as if daily
bread were the only end of wearisome life, and a wearisome life
the only occasion of daily bread. .
This put me in mind of the life I lived in my kingdom, the
island; where I suffered no more corn to grow, because I did
not want it, and bred no more goats. because I had no more use
for them; where the money lay in the drawer till it grew mouldy,
and had scarce the favour to be looked upon in twenty years.
It 2
All these things, had I improved them as l ougnt to Ben
done, and as reason and religion had dictated to me, would have
taught me to search farther than human enjoyments for a full
felicity; and that there was something which certainly was the
reason and end of life, superior to all these things, and which
was either to he possessed, or at least hoped for, on this side the
ave.
gflint my sage counsellor was gone; I was like a ship without
a pilot, that could only run afore the wind: my thoughts ran all
238 mvsnrunns or
the whimsies of foreign adventures; and all t e pleasant, inno-
cent amusements of my farm, my garden, my cattle, and my
family, which before entirely possessed me, were nothing to me,
had no relish, and were like music to one that has no ear, or
food to one that has no taste: in a word, I resolved to leave 08‘
housekeeping, let my farm, and return to London; and in a few
months after I did so.
When I came to London, 1 was still as uneasy as I was before;
I had no relish for the place, no employment in it, nothing to do
but to saunter about like an idle person, of whom it maybe said
he is perfectly useless in God's creation, and it is not one far—
thing’s matter to the rest of his kind whether he be dead or
alive. This also was the thing which, of all circumstances of
life, was the most my aversion, who had been all my days used
to an active life; and I would often say to myself: A state of
idleness is the very dregs of life; and indeed I thought I was
much more suitably employed when I was twenty~six days
making me a deal board.
It was now the beginning of the year 1693, when my nephew,
whom, as I have observed before, I had brought up to the sea,
and had made him commander of a ship, was come home from a
238 mvsnrunns or
to me, and told me that some merchants of his acquaintance had
been proposing to him to go a voyage for them to the East Indies
and to China, as private traders—And now, uncle, says be, if
you will go to sea with me, I will engage to land you upon your
old habitation in the island; for we are to touch at the Brazils.
Nothing can be a greater demonstration of a future state, and
of the existence of an invisible world, than the concurrence of
second causes with the ideas of things which we form in our
minds, perfectly reserved, and not communicated to any in the
world.
My nephew knew nothing how far my distemper of wandering
was returned upon me, and I knew nothing of what he had in
his thought to say, when that very morning, before he came to
me, I had, in a great deal of confusion of thought, and revolving
every part of my circumstances in my mind, come to this reso-
‘utiou, viz., th at I would go tc Lisbon, and consult with my old
lea-captain; and so, if it was rational and practicable, [would gt
and see the island again, and see what was become of my people
there. I had pleased myself with the thoughts of peopling the
place, and carrying inhabitants from hence, getting a. .patent for
the possession, and I knew not what; when, in the middle of all
this, in comes my nephew, as I have said, with his project of
carrying me thither in his way to the East Indies.
I paused awhile at his words, and, looking steadily at him,
What devil, said I, sent you on this unlucky errand? My nephew
aon' sson causos. 239
I was not much displeased with the proposal, he recovered him-
self. I hope it may not be an unlucky proposal, sir, says he; I
dare say you would be pleased to see your new colony there,
where you once reigned with more felicity than most of your
brother-monarchs in the world. >
In a word, the scheme hit so exactly with my temper, that is
to say, the prepossession I was under, and of which I have said
so much, that I told him, in a few words, if he agreed with the
merchants I would go with him: but I told him I would not pro-
mise to go any farther than my own island. Why, sir, says be,
you don’t want to be left there again, I hope? Why, said I,
can you not take me up again on your return? He told me it
would not be possible to do so; that the merchants would never
allow him to come that way with a. laden ship of such value, it
being a month's sail out of his way, and might be three or four.
Besides, sir, if I should miscarry, said he, and not return at all, then
you would be just reduced to the condition you were in before.
This was very rational; but we both found out a remedy for it;
which was to carry a framed sloop on board the ship, which being
taken in pieces, and shipped on board the ship, might by the help
of some carpenters. whom we agreed to carry with us, be set up
aon' sson causos. 239
I was not long resolving; for indeed the importunities of my
nephew joined so effectually with my inclination, that nothing
could oppose me: on the other hand, my wife being dead, I had
nobody concerning themselves so much for me as to persuade me
to one way or the other, except my ancient good friend the widow,
who earnestly struggled with me to consider my years, my eas
circumstances, and the needless hazards of a long voyage; an ,
above all, my young children. But it was all to no purpose;—
I had an irresistible desire to the voyage; and I told her I thought
there was something so uncommon in the impressions I had upon
my mind for the voyage, that it would be a kind of resisting Pro-
vidence if I should attempt to sta at home: after which she
ceased her ex postulations, andjoine with me, not only in making
aon' sson causos. 239
r my absence, and providing for the education of my children.
In order to this, I made my will and settled the estate I had
in such a manner for my children, and placed in such hands, that

for her care: all which she richly deserved, for no mother could
have taken more care in their education, or understood it better;
and as she lived till I came home, I also lived to thank her for it.
My nephew was ready to sail about the beginning of January
l694~5; and l, with my man Friday, went on board in the Downs
the 8th ; having, besides that sloop which I mentioned above, avery
considerable cargo of all kinds of necessary things for my colony;
=40 ADVENTURE 0!
First, I carried with me some servants, whom I proposed to
place there as inhabitants, or at least to set on work there, upon
my account, while I stayed, and either to leave them there, or
carry them forward, as they would appear willing: particularly,
I carried two carpenters, a smith, and a very handy, ingenious
fellow, who was a cooper by trade, and was also a general
mechanic; for he was dexterous at making wheels, and hand-mills
to grind corn, was a good turner, and a good pot-maker; he also
made any thing that was proper to make of earth, or of wood;
in a word, we called him our Jack of all trades. With these I
carried a tailor, who had offered himself to go a passenger to the
East Indies with my nephew, but afterwards consented to stay
on our new plantation; and proved a most necessary, handy fellow
as could be desired, in many other businesses besides that of his
trade: for, as I observed formerly, necessity arms us for all em-
ployments.
My cargo, as near as I can recollect, for I had not kept account
=40 ADVENTURE 0!
some English thin stuffs, for clothing the Spaniards that I ex-
=40 ADVENTURE 0!
might comfortably supply them for seven years: if I remember
right, the materials I carried for clothing them, with gloves, hats,
shoes, stockings, and all such things as they could want for wear-
ing, amounted to above two hundred pounds, including some
=40 ADVENTURE 0!
with pots, kettles, pewter, brass, &c. and near a hundred pounds
more in iron work, nails, tools of every kind, staples, hooks,
hinges, and every necessary thing I could think of.
I carried also a hundred spare arms. muskets, and fusees;
besides some pistols, a considerable quantity of shot of all sizes,
three or four tons of lead, and two pieces of brass cannon; and
because I knew not what time and what extremities I was pro-
viding for, I carried a hundred barrels of powder, besides swords,
cutlasses, and the iron part of some pikes and halberds: so that,
in short, we had a large magazine of all sorts of stores: and I
made my nephew carry two small quarter-deck guns more than he
wanted for his ship, to leave behind it“ there was occasion; that,

obliged to put in at Galway in Ireland, where we lay wind-
bound two-and-twenty days; but we had this satisfaction with
the disaster, that provisions were here exceeding cheap, and in
the utmost plenty; so that while we lay here, we never touched
the ship’s stores, but rather added to them. Here, also, I took
in several live hogs, and two cows, with their calves; which I
resolved, if I had a good assage, to put on shore in my island;
but we found occasion to gispose otherwise of them.




SECTION XXXI.
ROBINSON'S SHIP BELIEVES THE CREW OF A FRENCH VBSEL THAT
HAD CAUGHT FIRE.
WE set out on the 5th of February from Ireland, and had a very
fair gale of wind for some days. As I remember, it might be about
the 20th of February, in the evening late, when the mate, having
242 anv rzmunas o;
242 anv rzmunas o;
a boy came in, and told us the boatswain heard another. This
made us all run out upon the quarter-deck, where, for a while,
we heard nothing; but in a few minutes we saw a very great light,

immediately we had recourse to our reckonings, in which we all

at W.N.W. Upon this we concluded it must be some ship on

we concluded that it could not be far off, we stood directly

because, the farther we sailed, the greater the light appeared;
though, the weather being hazy, we could not perceive anything
but the light for a while. In about half an hour’s sailing, the
wind being fair for us, though not much of it, and the weather
clearing up a little, we could plainly discern that it was a great

I was most sensibly touched with this disaster, though not at
all mluainted with the persons engaged 1n it; I presently recol-
lected my former circumstances, and in what condition I was in,
when taken up by the Portuguese captain; and how much more
deplorable the circumstances of the poor creatures belonging to
that ship must be, if they had no other ship in company with

We lay by some time upon this, only driving as the burning
ship drove, waiting for daylight; when, on a sudden, to our great

the air; and immediately, that is to say, in a few minutes, all

lights to be hung out in all the parts of the ship where we could,

night long; letting them know, by this, that there was a ship
not far off.
About eight o'clock in the morning we discovered the ship’s
boats by the help of our perspective glasses; found there were
two of them, both thronged with people, and deep in the water.
We perceived they rovved, the wind being against them; that
they saw our ship, and did their utmost to make us see them.
We immediately spread our ancient, to let them know we saw
them, and hung a waft out, as a signal for them to come on
board; and then made more sail, standing directly to them. In
little more than half an hour we came up with them ; and, in a
word, took them all in, being no less than sixty-four men,
women, and children; for there were a great many passengers.
Upon the whole, we found it was a French merchant-ship of
three hundred tons, home-bound from Quebec, in the river of
Canada. The master gave us a long account of the distress of

and afterwards getting in between the timbers, and within the
ceiling of the ship, it proceeded into the hold, and mastered all
the skill and all the application they were able to exert.
They had no more to do then, but to get into their boats.
which, to their great comfort, were pretty large; being their

that some ship might happen to be at sea, and might take them
in. They had sails, oars, and a compass; and were preparing
to make the best of their way back to Newfoundland, the wind
blowing pretty fair, for it blew an easy gale at S. E. by E. They
had as much provision and water as, with sparing it so as to be
next door to starving, might support them about twelve days;
in which, if they had no bad weather, and no contrary winds,
the captain said he hoped he might get to the Banks of New-
244 anvnN‘ro ass or
till they might go on shore. But there were so many chances
against them in all these cases, such as storms, to overset and
founder them; rains and cold, to beuumb and perish their limbs;
contrary winds, to keep them out and starve them; that it must
have been next to miraculous if they had escaped.
In the midst of their consternation, every one being hopeless
and ready to despair, the captain, with tears in his eyes, told
me they were on a sudden surprised with the joy of hearing a
244 anvnN‘ro ass or
244 anvnN‘ro ass or
their hearts, and gave them the notice, which, as above, I desired
it should, viz. that there was a ship at hand for their help. It was
upon the hearing of these guns that they took down their masts
and sails: the sound coming from the windward, they resolved
to lie by till morning. Some time after this, hearing no more
244 anvnN‘ro ass or
another; but these, the wind being contrary, we never heard.
Some time after that again, they were still more agreeably
surprised with seeing our lights, and hearing the guns which, as
244 anvnN‘ro ass or
set them to work with their cars, to keep their boats ahead, at
least, that we might the sooner come up with them; and, at last,
to their inexpressible Joy, they found we saw them.
It is impossible for me to express the several gestures, the
strange ecstasies, the variety of postures, which these poor
delivered people ran into, to express the joy of their souls at so
unexpected a deliverance. Grief and fear are easily described;
sighs, tears, groans, and a very few motions of the head and
hands, make up the sum of its variety; but an excess of joy, a
surprise of joy, has a thousand extravagances in it: there were
some in tears; some raging and tearing themselves, as if the)
had been in the greatest agonies of sorrow; some stark raving
and downright lunatic; some ran about the ship stamping with
their feet, others wringing their hands; some were dancing,
some singing, some laughing, more crying; many quite dumb,
not able to s eak a word; others sick and vomiting: several
awooning, an ready to faint; and a few were crossing them-
selves, and giving God thanks.
I would not wrong them neither; there might be many that
were thankful afterwards, but the passion was too strong for
aonmson causoa. 245
thrown into ecstasies, and a kind of frenzy; and it was but a
very few that were composed and serious in their joy.
Perhaps, also, the case may have some addition to it from the
particular circumstance of that nation they belonged to; I mean
the French, whose temper is allowed to be more volatile, more
aonmson causoa. 245
in other nations.“ I am not philosopher enough to determine the
cause; but nothing I had ever seen before came up to it. The
ecstasies poor Fri ay, my trusty savage, was in, when he found
his father in the boat, came the nearest to it; and the surprise
of the master and his two companions, whom I delivered from
the villains that set them on shore in the island, came a little
way towards it; but nothing was to compare to this, either that
I saw in Friday, or any where else in my life.
It is further observable, that these extravagances did not
show themselves, in that different manner I have mentioned, in
different persons only; but all the variety would appear, in a
short succession of moments, in one and the same person. A
man that we saw this minute dumb, and as it were stupid and
confounded, would the next minute be dancing and hallooing
like an antic; and the next moment he tearing his hair, or pulling
his clothes to pieces, and stamping them under his feet, like a
madman; in a few moments after that, we would have him all
in tears, then sick, swooning, and, had not immediate help been
had, he would in a few moments have been dead; and thus it
was, not with one or two, or ten or twenty, but with the greatest
part of them: and if I remember right, our surgeon was obliged
to let blood of about thirty of them. _
There were two priests among them, one an old man, and the
other a young man; and that which was strangest was, the
oldest man was the worst. As soon as he set his foot on board
our ship, and saw himself safe, he dropped down stone-dead, to
all appearance; not the least sign of life could be perceived in
him: our surgeon immediately applied proper remedies to re-
cover him, and was the onl man in the ship that believed he
was not dead. At length e opened a vein in his am, having

little time uite well. After the blood was stopped, he walked
about; tol us he was perfectly well; took a dram of cordial
which the surgeon gave him, and was what we called come to
himself. About a quarter of an hour after this, they came run-
ning into the cabin to the surgeon, who was bleeding 3. French
woman that had fainted, and told him the priest was gone stark
mad. It seems he had begun to revolve the change of his cir-
cumstances in his mind, and again this put him into an ecstasy
of joy; his spirits whirled about faster than the vessels could
convey them, the blood grew hot and feverish, and the man was

would not bleed him again in that condition, but gave him
something to doze and put him to sleep, which, after some time,
operated upon him, and he awoke next morning perfectly com-
posed and well. >
The younger priest behaved with great command of his
passions, and was really an example of a serious, well governed
246 Anvan'ruans 01
246 Anvan'ruans 01
liverance, in which I unhappily and unseasonably disturbed
him, really thinking he had been in a swoon; but he spoke
calmly, thanked me, told me he was giving God thanks for his
deliverance; begged me to leave him a few moments, and that,
next to his Maker, he would give me thanks also.
I was heartily sorry that [disturbed him, and not only left
him, but kept others from interrupting him also. He continued
in that posture about three minutes, or little more, after I left
him; then came to me, as he had said he would, and, with a
great deal of seriousness and affection, but with tears in his
eyes, thanked me, that had, under God, given him, and so many
miserable creatures, their lives. I told him I had no room to
move him to thank God for it, rather than me, for I had seen
that he had done that already; but, I added, that it was nothing
but what reason and humanity dictated to all men; and that we
had as much reason as he to give thanks to God, who had
blessed us so far, as to make us the instruments of his mercy
to so many of his creatures.
After this, the young priest applied himself to his country-
folks; laboured to compose them; persuaded, entreated, argued,
reasoned with them, and did his utmost to keep them within the
exercise of their reason; and with some he had success, though
others were for a time out of all government of themselves.
I cannot help committing this to writing, as perhaps it may
be useful to those into whose hands it may fall, for the guiding
themselves in all the extravagances of their passions; for if an
excess of joy can carry men out to such a length beyond the
reach of their reason, what will not the extravagances of angel,
rage. and a provoked mind, carry us to? And, indeed, here I
saw reason for keeping an exceeding watch over our passions
of every kind, as well those of joy and satisfaction, as those of
sorrow and anger.
We were something disordered, by these extravagances among,

retired, lodgings provided for them as well as our ship Would
allow, and they had slept heartily—as most of them did, being
fatigued and frightened—they were quite another sort of people
the next day.
Nothing of good manners, or civil acknowledgments for the
kindness shown them, was wanting; the French, it is known
are naturally apt enough to exceed that way. The captain and
one of the priests came to me the next day, and desired to speak
with me and my nephew : the commander began to consult with
aonmson causon. 247
we had saved their lives, so all they had was little enough for a
return to us for that kindness received. The captain said they
had saved some money, and some things of value, in their boats,

they might get a passage to France. My nephew was for

with them afterwards; but I overruled him in that part, for I
knew what it was to be set on shore in a strange country : and
if the Portuguese captain that took me up at sea had served me
so, and took all I had for my deliverance, I must have starved,
or have been as much a slave at the Brazils as I had been at
Barbary, the mere being sold to a Mahometan excepted; and
perhaps a Portuguese is not a much better master than a Turk,
if not, in some cases, much worse.
I therefore told the French captain that we had taken them up
in their distress, it was true, but that it was our duty to do so,
as we were fellow-creatures; and we would desire to be so deli-
vered, if we were in the like, or any other extremity; that we had
done nothing for them but what we believed they would have
done for us, if we had been in their case, and the in ours; but
that we took them up to save them, not to plun er them; and
it would be a most barbarous thing to take that little from them

as ship was bound to the East Indies; and t ough we were
driven out of our course t.) the westward a very great way, and
perhaps were directed by Heaven on purpose for their deliver-
ance, yet it was impossible for us wilfully to change our voyage
on their particular account; nor could my nephew, the captain,
answer it to the freighters, with whom he was under charter
party to pursue his voyage by the way of Brazil: and all I knew
we could do for them, was to put ourselves in the way of meeting
with other ships homeward bound from the West Indies, and get
them a passage, if possible, to England or France.
24S anvssruans or
could not but be very thankful for it; but they were in a very
great consternation,'especially the passengers, at the notion of
being carried away to the East Indies : they then entreated me,
that seeing I was driven so far to the westward before I met with
them, I would at least keep on the same course to the Banks of
Newfoundland, where it was probable I might meet with some
ship or sloop that they might hire to carry them back to Canada,
from whence they came.
I thought this was but a reasonable request on their part, and
therefore I inclined to agree to it; for, indeed, I considered, that
to carry this whole company to the East Indies, would not only
he an intolerable severity upon the poor people, but would be
ruining our whole voyage, by devouring all our provisions; sol
thought it no breach of charter-party, but what an unforeseen
accident made absolutely necessary to us, and in which no one
could say we were to blame; for the laws of God and nature
would have forbid that we should refuse to take up two boats'
full of people in such a distressed condition; and the nature of
the thing, as well respecting ourselves as the poor people, obliged
us to set them on shore somewhere or other for their deliver-
ance: so I consented that we would carry them to Newfound-
land, if wind and weather would permit; and if not, that I would
carry them to Martinico, in the West Indies.




SECTION XXXII.
BELIEVES THE CREW OF A BRISTOL SHIP, WHO ARE STABVING—
ARRIVES AT HIS ISLAND.
THE wind continued fresh easterly, but the weather pretty good,
and as the winds had continued in the points between NE. and
S.E. a long time, we missed several 0 portunities of sending
them to France; for we met several s lps bound to Europe,
whereof two were French, from St. Christopher’s; but they had
been so long beating up against the wind, that they durst take
in no passengers, for fear of wanting provisions for the voyage,
as well for themselves as for those they should take in; so we
were obliged to go on. It was about a week after this that we
made the Banks of Newfoundland; where, to shorten my story,
we put all our French people on board a bark, which they hired
at sea there, to put them on shore, and afterwards to carry them
to France, if they could get provisions to victual themselves with.
When I say all the French went on shore, I should remember,
that the young priest I spoke of, hearing we were bound to the
East Indies, desired to go the voyage with us, and to be set on
shore on the coast of Coromandel; which I readily agreed to,
for I wonderfully liked the man, and had very good reason, as
will appear afterwards: also four of the seamen entered them
selves on our ship, and proved very useful fellows.
From hence we directed our course to the West Indies, steering
away S. and S. by E. for about twenty days together, sometimes
little or no wind at all ; when we met with another subject for
our humanity to work upon, almost as deplorable as that before.

what to make of her, till, after coming a little nearer, we found
she had lost her main topmast, foremast, and bowsprit; and
250 anvsm‘uans o!
was pretty good, wind at N.N.W., a fresh gale, and we soon came
to speak with her.
We found her a ship of Bristol, bound home from Barbadoes,
but had been blown out of the road at Barbadoes a few days
before she was ready to sail, by a terrible hurricane, while the
captain and chief mate were both gone on shore; so that, besides
the terror of the storm, they were in an indifferent case for good
artists to bring the ship home. They had been already nine
weeks at sea, and had met with another terrible storm, after the
hurricane was over, which had blown them quite out of their
knowledge to the westward, and in which they lost their masts, as
above. They told us they expected to have seen the Bahama
islands, but were then driven away again to the south-east, by a
strong gale of wind at N.N.W., the same that blew now: and
having no sails to work the ship with but a maincourse, and a
kind of s uare sail upon a jury foremast, which they had set up,
they could not lie near the wind, but were endeavouring to stand
away for the Canaries.
But that which was worst of all was, that they were almost
starved for want of provisions, besides the fatigues they had
250 anvsm‘uans o!
one ounce left in the ship, and had none for eleven days. The
only relief the had was, their water was not all spent, and they
250 anvsm‘uans o!
250 anvsm‘uans o!
devoured; and they had seven casks of rum.
There were a youth and his mother, and a maid—servant, on
board, who were going passengers, and thinking the ship was
ready to sail, unhappily came on board the evening before the
hurricane began; and having no provisions of their own left,
they were in a more deplorable condition than the rest: for the
seamen, being reduced to such an extreme necessity themselves,
had no compassion, we may be sure, for the poor passengers;
and they were, indeed, in a condition, that their misery is very
hard to describe.
I had erhaps not known this part, if my curiosity had not
led me (t e weather being fair, and the wind abated) to go on
board the ship. The second mate, who, upon this occasion,
commanded the shi , had been on board our ship, and he told
me, indeed, they ha three passengers in the great cabin, that
were in a deplorable condition: Nay, says he, I behave they are
dead, for I have heard nothing of them for above two days; and
I was afraid to inquire after them, said be, for I had nothing to
relieve them with.
We immediately applied ourselves to give them what relief we
could spare; and, indeed, I had so far overruled things with my
nephew, that I would have victualled them, though we had gone
away to Virginia, or any other part of the coast of America, to
have supplied ourselves; but there was no necessity for that.
But now they were in a new danger; for they were afraid of
eating too much, even of that little we gave them. The mate or
commander brought six men with him in his boat; but these poor
wretches looked like skeletons, and were so weak, that they could
hardly sit to their oars. The mate himself was very ill, and half
starved: for he declared he had reserved nothing from the men,
and went share and share alike with them in every bit they ate.
I cautioned him to eat sparingly, but set meat beft'n-e him im-
mediately; and he had not eaten three mouthfuls before he began
to be sick, and out of order; so he stopped awhile, and our surgeon
mixed him up something with some broth, which he said would
be to him both food and physic; and after he had taken it, he
grew better. In the mean time, I forgot not the men; I ordered
victuals to be given them; and the poor crea-tures rather devoured
than ate it: they were so exceeding hungry, that they were in a
kind ravenous, and had no command of themselves; and two of
them ate with so much greediness, that they were in danger of
their lives the next morning.
The sight of these people‘s distress was very moving to me, and
aonmson :ausol. 251
coming on shore in my island, where I had never the least mouth-
ful of food, or any prospect of procuring any ; besides the hourly
apprehensions I had of being made the food of other creatures.
But all the while the mate was thus relating to me the miserable
condition of the ship's company, I could not put out of my thought
the story he had told me of the three poor creatures in the great
cabin, viz., the mother, her son, and the maid-servant, whom he
had heard nothing of for two or three days, and whom, he seemed
to confess, they had wholly neglected, their own extremities being
so great: by which I understood that they had really given them
no food at all, and that therefore they must be perished, and be
aonmson :ausol. 251
As I therefore kept the mate, whom we then called captain, on
board with his men, to refresh them, so I also forgot not the
starving crew that were left on board; but ordered my ovm boat
to go on board the ship, and, with my mate and twelve men, to
aonmson :ausol. 251
Our surgeon charged the men to cause the meat to be boiled
while they stayed, and to keep guard in the cook-room to pre-
vent the men taking it to eat raw, or taking it out of the pot
S
before it was well boiled, and then to give every man but a very
little at a time: and by this caution he preserved the men, who
would otherwise have killed themselves with that very food that
was given them on purpose to save their lives.
At the same time, I ordered the mate to go into the great
cabin, and see what condition the poor passengers were in; and
if they were alive, to comfort them, and give them what refresh-
ment was proper: and the surgeon gave him a large pitcher,
with some of the prepared broth which he had given the mate
that was on board, and which he did not question would restore
them gradually.
252 anvarrvars or
great mind to see the stene of misery which I knew the ship itself
would present me with, in a more lively manner than I could have
it by report, I took the captain of the ship, as we now called him,
with me, and went myself, a little after, in their boat.
I found the poor men on board almost in a tumult, to get the
victuals out of the boiler before it was ready; but my mate
observed his orders, and kept a good guard at the cook-room
door; and the man he placed there, after using all possible per-
252 anvarrvars or
caused some biscuit-cakes to be dipped in the pot, and softened
with the liquor of the meat, which they called brewis, and gave
them every one some, to stay their stomachs, and told them it
was for their own safety that he was. obliged to give them but
little at a time. But it was all in vain; and had I not come on
252 anvarrvars or
good words, and Some threats also of giving them no more, I
believe they would have broken into the cook-room by force,
and torn the meat out of the furnace; for words are indeed of
252 anvarrvars or
252 anvarrvars or
252 anvarrvars or
did well enough.
But the misery of the poor passengers in the cabin was of
another nature, and far beyond the rest; for as the ship's com-
pany had so little for themselves, it was but too true that they
252 anvarrvars or
them; so that for six or seven days it might be said they had really
no food at all, and for several days before very little. The poor
mother, who, as the men reported, was a woman of sense and
good breeding, had spared all she could so affectionately for her
son, that at last she entirely sunk under it; and when the mate

up against the sides, between two chairs, which were lashed fast,
and her head sunk between her shoulders, like a corpse, though
not quite dead. My mate said all he could to revive and en-
couragc her, and with a spoon put some broth into her mouth.
IOBINSON CRUSOI, .153
yet she understood what he said, and made signs to him, inti-
mating that it was too late for her, but pointed to her child, as
it she would have said they should take care of him, However,
the mate, who was exceedingly moved with the sight, endeavoured
to get some of the broth into her mouth, and, as he said, got two
or three spoonfuls down; though I question whether he could
be sure of it or not: but it was too late, and she died the same
night.
IOBINSON CRUSOI, .153
tionate mother’s life, was not so far gone: yet he lay in a cabin-
bed, as one stretched out, with hardly any life left in him. He
had a piece of an old glove in his mouth, having eaten up the
rest of it: however, being young, and having more strength than
his mother, the mate got something down his throat, and he
began sensibly to revive; though b giving him, some time after,
but two or three spoonfuls extraor inary, he was very sick, and
orought it up again.
But the next care was the poor maid: she lay all along upon
the deck, hard by her mistress, and just like one that had fallen
down with an apoplexy, and struggled for life. Her limbs were
distorted; one of her hands was clasped round the frame of a
chair, and she gn'ped it so hard, that we could not easily make
her let it go: her other arm lay over her head, and her feet lay
both together, set fast against the frame of the cabin-table: in
short, she lay just like one in the agonies of death, and yet she
was alive too.
The poor creature was not only starved with hunger, and
IOBINSON CRUSOI, .153
afterwards, was broken-hearted for her mistress, whom she saw
dying for two or three days before, and whom she loved most
tenderly.
We knew not what to do with this poor girl; for when our
surgeon, who was a man of very great knowledge and experience,
had with great application recovered her as to life, be had her
upon his hands as to her senses; for she was little less than dis-
tracted for a considerable time after, as shall appear presently.
Whoever shall read these memorandums must be desired to
consider, that visits at sea are not like a journey into the country,
where sometimes people stay a week or a fortnight at a place:
our business was to relieve this distressed ship’s crew, but not
lie by for them; and though they were willing to steer the same
course with us for some days, yet we could carry no sail, to keep
pace with a ship that had no masts: however, as their captain
egged of us to help him to set up a main topmast, and a kind
of a topmast to his jury foremast, we d1], as it were, lie by him

and taking three casks of sugar, some rum, and some pieces of
eight from them for satisfaction, we left them; taking on board
with us, at their own earnest request, the youth and the maid.
and all their goods.
The young lad was about seventeen years of age; a pretty,
well bred, modest, and sensible youth, greatly dejected with the
loss of his mother, and, as it seems, had lost his father but a few
months before, at Barbadoes : he begged of the surgeon to speak
to me to take him out of the ship: for he said the cruel fellows
had murdered his mother: and, indeed, so they had, that is to
say, passively; for they might have spared a small sustenance
to the poor helpless widow, that might have preserved her life,
though it had been but just enough to keep her alive: but hunger
knows no friend, no relation, no justice, no right; and therefore
is remorseless, and capable of no compassion.
The surgeon told him how far we were going, and that it would
carry him away from all his friends, and put him perhaps in as
bad circumstances almost as those we found him in, that is to
say, starving in the world. He said it mattered not whither he
went, if he was but delivered from the terrible crew that he was
among; that the captain (by which he meant me, for he could
know nothing of my nephew) had saved his life, and he was sure
would not hurt him; and as for the maid, he was sure, if she
came to herself, she would be very thankful for it, let us carry
them where we would. The surgeon re resented the case so
affectionately to me, that I yielded, an we took them both
on board, with all their goods, except eleven hogsheads of sugar,
which could not be removed or come at; and as the youth had
a bill of lading for them, Imade his commander sign a writing,
obliging himself to go, as soon as he came to Bristol, to one
Mr. Rogers, a merchant there, to whom the .youth said he was
related, and to deliver a letter which I wrote to him, and all the
goods he had belonging to the deceased widow; which I suppose
was not done, for I could never learn that the ship came to
Bristol, but was, as is most probable, lost at sea; being in so
disabled a condition, and so far from any land, that I am of

>234 mvnm'umzs or
nobody with the little incidents of wind, weather, currents, 8w.
on the rest of our voyage; but to shorten my story, for the sake
of what is to follow, shall observe, that I came to my old habi-
tation, the island, on the 10th of April, 1695. It was with no small

from it, cfore, on the south and east side of the island, as coming
from the Brazils, so now, coming in between the mam and the
island, and having no chart for the coast, nor any landmark, I
did not know it when I saw it, or know whether I saw it or not.
We beat about a great while, and went on shore on several
islands in the mouth of the great river Oronooo, but none for my
purpose; only this I learned by my coasting the shore, that I
was under one great mistake before, viz. that the continent which
I thought I saw from the island I lived in, was really no conti-
nent, but a long island, or rather a ridge of islands, reaching
from one to the other side of the extended mouth of that great
river; and that the savages who came to my island were not
properly those which we call Caribbees, but islanders, and other
barbarians of the same kind, who inhabited something nearer to
our side than the rest.
In short, Ivisited several of these islands to no purpose; some
I found were inhabited, and some were not: on one of them I
found some Spaniards, and thought they had lived there; but
speaking with them, found they had a sloop lay in a small creek
hard by, and came thither to make salt and to catch some pearl
muscles, if they could; but that they belonged to the Isle de
Trinidad, which lay farther north, in the latitude of ten and
eleven degrees. .
Thus coasting from one island to another, sometimes with the
ship, sometimes with the F renchmen’s shallop, which we had
found a convenient boat, and therefore kept her with their very
good will, at length I came fair on the south side of my island,
and presently knew the very countenance of the place: so I
brought the ship safe to an anchor, broadside with the little
creek where my old habitation was.

ROBINSON AND FRIDAY 60 ASHORE—THE LA'ITER. MEETS WITH

AS soon as I saw the place, I called for Friday, and asked him
if he knew where he was; he looked about a little, and presently
clapping his hands, cried, 0 yes, 0 there, 0 yes, 0 there, pointin
to our old habitation, and fell dancing and capering like a. mag

Friday? says I; are you troubled because you may see your

no, never more see him again. Why so, said 1, Friday? how do
you know that? 0 no, 0 no, says Friday; he long ago die, long
ago; lie much old man. Well, well, says I, Friday, you don't
know; but shall we see any one else, then? The fellow, it seems,
had better eyes than I, and he points to the hill just above my
old house; and though we lay half a league off, he cries out,
We see, we see, yes, yes, we see much man there, and there, and
there. I looked, but I saw nobody, no, not with a perspective
glass, which was, I suppose, because I could not hit the place;
for the fellow was right, as I found upon inquiry the next day;
256 mvnnrusss or

As soon as Friday told me he saw people, I caused the English

then stood and looked at him, as any one would look at a strange
picture, for a quarter of an hour together ; then lay down on the
ground, and stroked his legs, and kissed them, and then got up
again, and stared at him; one would have thought the fellow
bewitched. But it would have made a dog laugh the next day
to see how his passion ran out another way; in the morning he
walked along the shore, to and again, with his father several
hours, always leading him by the hand, as if he had been a lady;
and every now and then he would come to the boat to fetch
something or other for him, either a lump of sugar, a dram, a
biscuit-cake, or something or other that was good. In the after-
noon his frolics ran another way; for then he would set the old
man down upon the ground and dance about him, and make a
thousand antic postures and gestures; and all the while he did
this, he would be talking to him, and telling him one story or
other of his travels, and of what had happened to him abroad, to

At which he spoke not a word, but giving his musket to the man
that was with him, threw his arms abroad, sayin something in
Spanish that I did not perfectly hear, came forwar and embraced
me ; telling me he was inexcusable not to know that face again,
that he had once seen as if an angel from heaven sent to save
his life: he said abundance of very handsome things, as a well-
bred Spaniard always knows how; and then beckoning to the
person that attended him, bade him go and call out his com-
rades. He then asked me if I would walk to my old habitation,
where he would give me ossessiou of my own house again, and
where I should see they had made but mean improvements: so

windings and blind ways as they themselves only, who made

was not there.
As to the three barbarians (so he called them) that were left
behind, and of whom, he said, he had a long story to tell me, the
Spaniards all thought themselves much better among the sa-
vages, only that their number was so small: and, says he, had
they been strong enough, we had been all long ago in purgatory;
and with that he crossed himself on the breast. But, sir, says
he, I hope you will not be displeased when I shall tell you how,

. While I was thus saying this, the man came whom he had
sent back, and with him eleven men more. In the dress they
were in, it was impossible to guess what nation they were of ;
but he made all clear, both to them and to me. First he turned
to me, and pointing to them, said, These,‘ sir, are some of the
gentlemen who owe their lives to you; and then turning to
them, and pointing to me, he let them know who I was; upon
which the all came up, one by one, not as if they had been
sailors an ordinary fellc ws, and the like, but really as if they
had been ambassadors of noblemen, and I a monarch or great
conqueror: their behaviour was to the last degree obliging and
courteous, and yet mixed with a manly, majestic gravity, which
very well became them; and, in short, they had so much more
manners than I, that I scarce knew how to receive their civili
ties, much less how to return them in kind.
The historyr of their coming to, and conduct in, the island, after
my going away, is so very remarkable, and has so many inci-,
dents, which the former part of my relation will help to under-
stand, and which will, in most of the particulars, refer to the
account I have already given, that I cannot but commit them,

would give me a particular account of his voyage back to his
countrymen with the boat, when I mnt him to fetch them over.
He told me there was little variety in that part, for nothing
remarkable happened to them on the way, having had very calm
weather and a smooth sea. As for his countrymen, it could not
be doubted, he said, but that they were overjoyed to see him (it
seems he was the principal man among them, the captain‘of the
vessel they had been shipwrecked in having been dead some
time) ; they were, he said, the more surprised to see him, because
they knew that he was fallen into the hands of the savages, who,

he said, was somewhat like that of J oseph’s brethren, when he
told them who he was, and told them the story of his exaltation
in Pharaoh’s court; but when he showed them the arms, the
powder, the ball, and provisions, that he brought them for their
Journey or voyage, they were restored to themselves, took a just
share of the joy of their deliverance, and immediately prepared
to come away with him.

they wanted no time to get themselves ready; for they had no
baggage, neither clothes nor provisions, nor any thing in the
world but what they had on them, and a few roots to eat, of
which they used to make their bread.
They were in all three weeks absent; and in that time, un-
luckily for them, I had the occasion offered for my escape, as
I mentioned in my other part, and to get off from the island,
leaving three of the most impudent, hardened, ungoverned, dis-
agreeable villains behind me, that any man could desire to meet
with; to the poor Spaniards’ great grief and disappointment,
you may be sure.
_The only just thing the rogues did was, that when the Spa-
mar-dscame ashore, they gave my letter to them, and gave them

managing every part of my life there; the way how I baked my
bread, bred up tame goats, and plarted my corn; how I cured
my grapes, made my pots, and, in a word, every thing I did; all
this being written down, they gave to the Spaniards (two of them
understood English well enough) : nor did they refuse to accom-
modate the Spaniards with any thing else, for they agreed very
well for some time. They gave them an equal admission into
the house, or cave, and they began to live very sociably; and the
head Spaniard, who had seen pretty much of my methods, and
Friday’s father together, managed all their affairs: but as for the
Englishmen, they did nothing but ramble about the island, shoot
parrots, and catch tortoises; and when they came home at night,
the Spaniards provided their suppers for them.

whom I may call the accusers, yet when I came to examine the
fellows, they could not deny a word of it.
But before I come to the particulars of this part, I must supply
a defect in my former relation; and this was, I forgot to set
down, among the rest, that just as we were weighing the anchor
to set sail, there happened a little quarrel on board of our ship,
which I was once afraid would have turned to a second mutiny
nor was it appeased till the captain, rousing up his courage, and
taking us all to his assistance, parted them by force, and making
two of the most refractory fellows prisoners, he laid them in
irons ; and as they had been active in the former disorders, and
let fall some ugly, dangerous words, the second time he threat~
ened to carry them in irons to England, and have them hanged
there for mutiny, and running away with the ship. This, it
seems, though the captain did not intend to do it, frightened
some other men in the ship; and some of them had put it into
the heads of the rest that the captain only gave them good
words for the present, till they should come to some English
ort, and that then they should be all put into gaol, and tried
or their _lives. The mate got intelligence of this, and acquainted
us with it; upon which it was desired that I, who still passed
for a great man among them, should go down with the mate,
and satisfy the men, and tell them that they might be assured,
if they behaved well the rest of the voyage, all they had done
for the time past should be pardoned. So 1 went, and after
passing my honour’s word to them, they appeared easy, and the
more so when I caused the two men that were in irons to be
released and forgiven.
But this mutiny had brought us to an anchor for that night;
the wind also falling calm next morning, we found that our two
men who had been laid in irons had stole each of them a musket,
and some other weapons (what powder or shot they had we
knew not), and had taken the ship’s pinnace, which was not yet
haled up, and run away with her to their companions in roguery
on shore. As soon as we found this, I ordered the long-boat on
shore, with twelve men and the mate, and away they went to

to lay up their magazines and stores in; and the Spaniards

THEY were going on in this little thriving posture, when the
three unnatural rogues, their own countrymen too, in mere
humour, and to insult them, came and bullied them, and told
them the island was theirs; that the governor, meaning me, had
given them the possession of it, and nobody else had any right
to it; and that they should build no houses upon their ground,
unless they would pay rent for them.

grant a long lease; and desired they would get a scrivener to
draw the writings. One of the three, cursing and raging, told

The fellow was in such a rage at the honest man's thrusting

hand, and had not the man avoided the blow very nimbly, and

seeing the danger they were both in, ran in after him, and im-

honest men, bolder than his comrade, and made desperate by his
danger, told them, if they offered to move hand or foot they were
dead men, and boldly commanded them to lay down their arms.
They did not, indeed, lay down their arms, but seeing him so
resolute, it brought them to a parley, and they consented to take
their wounded man with them and be gone; and, indeed, it seems
264 ADVENTURES or
they were much in the wrong, since they had the advantage, that
they did not disarm them effectually, as they might have done,
and have gone immediately to the Spaniards, and given them an
account how the rogues had treated them; for the three villains
studied nothing but revenge, and every day gave them some in-
timation that they did so.
But not to crowd this part with an account of the lesser part
of the rogueries, such as treading down their corn; shooting
three young kids and a she goat, which the poor men had got
to breed up tame for their store; and, in a word, plaguing them
night and day in this manner; it forced the two men to such a
264 ADVENTURES or
time they had a fair opportunity. In order to this, they resolved
to go to the castle, as they called it (that was, my old dwelling),
where the three rogues and the Spaniards all lived together at
that time, intending to have a fair battle, and the Spaniards
should stand b , to see fair play: so they got up in the morning
before day, an came to the place, and called the Englishmen by
their names, telling a Spaniard that answered that they wanted
to speak with them.
It hap ened that the day before, two of the Spaniards, having
been in t e woods, had seen one of the two Englishmen, whom,
for distinction, I called the honest men, and he had made a sad
complaint to the Spaniards of the barbarous usage they had met
with from their three countrymen, and how they had ruined
their plantation, and destroyed their corn that they had laboured
so hard to bring forward, and killed the milch goat and their
lb! ee kids, which was all they had provided for their sustenance;
and that if he and his friends, meaning the Spaniards, did not
assist them again, they should be starved. When' the Spaniards
came home at night, and they were all at supper, one of them
took the freedom to reprove the three Englishmen, though in very
gentle and mannerly terms, and asked them how they could be
so cruel, they being harmless, inoffensive fellows; that they were
putting themselves in a way to subsist by their labour, and that
it had cost them a great deal of pains to bring things to such
perfection as they were then in.
One of the Englishmen returned very briskly, What had they
to do there? that they came on shore without leave; and that
they should not plant or build upon the island; it was none of
their ground. Why, says the Spaniard, very calmly, Senhor
Inglese, they must not starve. The Englishman replied, like a
rough-hewn tarpauling, They might starve and be d d; they
should not plant nor build in that place. But what must they
do then, senhor? said the Spaniard. Another of the brutes re-
turned, Do? d—n them, they should be servants, and work
for them. But how can you expect that of them? says the
Spaniard; they-are not bought with your money: you have no
right to make them servants. The Englishman answered, The
island was theirs; the governor had given it to them, and no
man had anything to do there but themselves; and with that
swore by his Maker that they would go and burn all their new
huts; they should build none upon their land. Why, senhor,
says the Spaniard, by the same rule, we must be your servants
too.—Ay, says the bold dog, and so you shall too, before we
have done with you; (mixing two or three G—d d—n me’s in
the proper intervals of his speech.) The Spaniard only smiled
at that, and made him no answer. However, this little discourse
had heated them; and, starting up, one says to the other, I think
it was he they called Will Atkins, Come, Jack, let’s go, and have
t'other brush with ’em; we’ll demolish their castle, I'll warrant
you; they shall plant no colony in our dominions.
Upon this they went all trooping away, with every man a gun,
a pistol, and a sword, and muttered some insolent things among
themselves, of what they would do to the Spaniards too, when
ROBINSON causes. 260
perfectly understand them as to know all the particulars, only
that, in general, they threatened them hard for taking the two
Englishman’s part.
Whither they went, or how they bestowed their time that
evening, the Spaniards said they did not know; but it seems they
wandered about the country part of the night, and then lying
down in the place which I used to call my bower, they were
weary, and overslept themselves. The case was this; they had
resolved to stay till midnight, and so take the two poor men when

they were asleep, and, as they acknowledged afterwards, ir tended
268 ADVENTURE! 02
them there, or murder them as they came out; as malice seldom
sleeps very soimd, it was very strange they should not have
oeen kept awake.
However, as the two men had also a design upon them, as 1
nave said, though a much fairer one than that of burning and
murdering, it happened, and very luckily for them all, that they
were up, and gone abroad, before the bloody-minded rogues came
to their huts.
When they came there, and found the men gone, Atkins, who,
it seems, was the forwardest man, called but to his comrade, Ha,
268 ADVENTURE! 02
They mused awhile, to think what should be the occasion of
their being gone abroad so soon, and suggested presently that the
Spaniards had given them notice of it ; and with that they shook
hands, and swore to one another that they would be revenged
of the Spaniards. As soon as they had made this bloody bargain,
they fell to work with the poor men’s habitation: they did not
268 ADVENTURE! 02
houses, and pulled them so limb from limb, that they left not the
least stick standing, or scarce any sign on the ground where they
stood; they tore all their little collected household-stuff in pieces,
, and threw every thing about in suchamanner, that the poor
men afterwards found some of their things a mile off their habi-
tation. When they had done this, they pulled up all the young
trees which the poor men had planted; pulled up an enclosure
they had made to secure their cattle and their corn; and, in a
word, sacked and plundered every thing as completely as a horde
of Tartars would have done.

they were but two to three; so that, had t ey met, there cer-
tainly would have been bloodshed among them; for they were
all very stout, resolute fellows, to give them their due.
, But Providence took more care to keep them asunder than
they themselves could do to meet: for, as if they had dogged
one another, when the three were gone thither, the two were

different conduct presently. When the three came back like

and told them what they had done, by way of scoff and bravado;
and one of them, stepping up to one of the Spaniards, as if they
had been a couple of boys at play, takes hold of his hat as it was
268 ADVENTURE! 02
says to him, And y-"u, Senhor Jack Spaniard, shall have the suns

though a quiet civil man, was as brave a man as could be, and
withal a strong, well-made man, looked at him for a good while,
and then, having no weapon in his hand, stepped gravely up to

really was, and that put him into some heat, for before he acted
all in a perfect calm; but now resolving to go through with his
work, he stooped, and took the fellow's musket whom he had
knocked down, and was just going to shoot the man who had
aosmsos csuson. 267
came out, and calling to him not to shoot, they stepped in,
secured the other two, and took their arms from them.
When they were thus disarmed, and found they had made all
the Spaniards their enemies, as well as their own countrymen,
they began to cool, and, giving the Spaniards better words,
would have their arms again ; but the Spaniards, considering the
feud that was between them and the other two Englishmen, and
that it would be the best method they could take to keep them
from killing one another, told them they would do them no harm,
and if they would live peaceably, they would be very willing to
assist and associate with them as they did before; but that they
could not think of giving them their arms again, while they
appeared so resolved to do mischief with them to their own
countrymen, and had even threatened them all to make them
their servants.
The rogues were now no more capable to hear reason than to
act with reason; but being refused their arms, they went raving
away, and raging like madmen, threatening what they would do,
aosmsos csuson. 267
threatening, told them they should take care how they offered
any injury to their plantation or cattle, for if they did, they
would shoot them as they would ravenous beasts, wherever they
found them ; and if they fell into their hands alive, they should
certainly be hanged. However, this was far from cooling them,
but away they went, raging and swearing like furies of hell. As
soon as they were gone, the two men came back, in passion and
rage enough also, though of another kind; for having been at
aosmsos csuson. 267
above, it will easily be supposed they had provocation enough.

The Spaniards, indeed, despised them, and especially, ha‘rmg
thus disarmed them, made light of their threatenings; but the
two Englishmen resolved to have their remedy against them,

them, they could not consent that they (the two) should pursue

Spaniard, who was their governor, we will endeavour to make
them do you justice, if you will leave it to us; for there is no
doubt but they will come to us again, when their passion is over,
being not able to subsist without our assistance: we promise
you to make no peace with them, without having a full satisfac-
tion for you ; and upon this condition we hope you will promise
to use no violence with them, other than in your own defence.
The two Englishmen yielded to this very awkwardly, and with
great reluctance; but the Spaniards protested that they did it
only to keep them from bloodshed, and to make all easy at last.
For, said they, we are not so many of us; here is room enough
for us all, and it is a great pity we should not be all good friends.
At length they did consent, and waited for the issue of the thing,
living for some days with the Spaniards; for their own habita-
tion was destroyed.
3,68 ADVENTURES or

3,68 ADVENTURES or
my Spaniard, who, as I have said, was the governor, and two
more with him walking by the side of the creek, they came up
in a very submissive, humble manner, and begged to be received
again into the family. The Spaniards used them civilly, but told
them they had acted so unnaturally by their countrymen, and so
very grossly by them (the Spaniards), that they could not come
to any conclusion without consulting the two Englishmen and
the rest; but, however, they would go to them, and discourse
about it, and they should know in half an hour. It may be
guessed that they were very hard put to it: for, it seems, as
they were to wait this half-hour for an answer, they begged they
would send them out some bread in the mean time, which they
3,68 ADVENTURES or
a boiled parrot, which they ate very heartily, for they were
hungry enough.
After half an hour's consultation, they were called in, and _a
long debate ensued ; their two countrymen charging them with
the ruin of all their labour, and a design to murder them; all
which they owned before, and therefore could not deny 30!.
Upon the whole, the Spaniards acted the moderator between
them; and as they had obliged the two Englishmen not to hurt
the three while they were naked and unarmed, so they now
obhged the three to go and rebuild their fellcws’ two huts, one
to be of the same, and the other of larger dimensions than they
were before; to fence their ground again where they nad pulled
up their fences, plant trees in the room of those pulled up, dig
up the land again for planting corn where they had spoiled it,
and, in a word, to restore every thing in the same state as they
found it, as near as the cauld; for entirely it could not be, the
season for the corn, an the growth of the trees and hedges, not
being possible to be recovered.
Well, they submitted to all this; and as they had plenty of
provisions given them all the while, they grew very orderly, and
the whole society began to live pleasantly and agreeably together
again; only, that these three fellows could never be persuaded
to work, I mean for themselves, except now and then a little,
just as they pleased: however, the Spaniards told them plainly,
that if they would but live sociably and friendly together, and
study the good of the whole plantation, they would be content
to work for them, and let them walk about and be as idle as
they pleased: and thus having lived pretty well together for a
month or two, the Spaniards gave them arms again, and gave
them liberty to go abroad with them as before.
It was not above a week after they had these arms, and went
abroad, but the ungrateful creatures began to be as insolent and
troublesome as before: but, however, an accident happened
presently upon this, which endangered the safety of them all;
and they were obliged to lay by all private resentments, and look
to the preservation of their lives.
It happened one night, that the Spanish governor, as Icall
him, that is to say, the Spaniard whose life I had saved, who
was now the captain, or leader, or governor of the rest, found
himself very uneasy in the night, and could by no means get any
sleep: he was perfectly well in body, as he told me the story,
only found his thoughts tumultuous; his mind ran upon men
ROBINSON causes. ’89
7 could not by any means get any sleep : in short, he lay a great
while ; but growing more and more uneasy, he resolved to rise.
Asthey lay, being so many of them, upon goats’ skins laid thick
upon such couches and pads as they made for themselves, and
not in hammocks and ship beds, as I did, who was but one, so
they had little to do, when they were willing to rise, but to get
'up upon their feet, and perhaps put on a coat, such as it was,
and their pumps, and they were ready for going any way that
their thoughts guided them. Being thus got up, he looked out:
but, being dark, he could see little or nothing; and besides, the
~t-rees which I had planted, as in my former account is described,
and which were now grown tall, intercepted his sight, so that he
could only look up, and see that it was a clear starlight night.
and hearing no noise, he returned and laid him down again : but
?t was all one; he could not sleep, nor could he compose himself

to anything like rest ; but his thoughts were to the last degree
uneasy, and he knew not for what.
Having made some noise with rising and walking about, going
out and coming in, another of them waked, and calling, asked
who it was that was up. The governor told him how it had been
with him. Say you so? says the other Spaniard; such things
are not to be slighted, I assure you; there is certainly some
mischief working near us: and presently he asked him, Where
are the Englishmen ?—They are all in their huts, says be, safe
enough. It seems the Spaniards had kept possession of the
main apartment, and had made a place for the three Englishmen,
who, since their last mutiny, were always quartered by them-
selves, and could not come at the rest. Well, says the Spaniard,

In a word, they went out, to go up to the top of the hill
where I used to go; but they being strong, and a good company,
not alone, as I was, used none of my cautions, to go up by the
ladder, and pulling it up after them, to go up a second stage to
' the top, but were going round through the grove, unconcerned
and unwary, when they were surprised with seeing a light as of

In all the discoveries I had made of the savages landing on
the island, it was my constant care to prevent them making the
least discovery of there being any inhabitant upon the place; and
when by any occasion they came to know it, they felt it so effect-
ually, that they that got away were scarce able to give any
account of it; for we disappeared as soon as possible; nor did
ever any that had seen me escape to tell any one else, except it
was the three savages in our last encounter, who jumped into
the boat; of whom I mentioned, I was afraid they should go
home and bring more help. Whether it was the consequence of

gether, or whether they came ignorantlv, and by accident, on
their usual bloody errand, the Spaniards could not, it seems,
understand; but whatever it was, it had been their business
either to have concealed themselves, or not to have seen them
at all, much less to have let the savages have seen that there
were any inhabitants in the place; or to have fallen upon them
In effectuallv, as that not a man of them should have escaped,
which could only have been by getting in between them and
their boats: but this presence of mind was wanting to them,
which was the ruin of their tranquillity for a great while.
We need not doubt but that the governor and the man with
him, surprised with this sight, ran back immediately, and raised
their fellows, giving them an account of the imminent danger
they were all in, and they again as readily took the alarm; but
it was impossible to persuade them to stay close within, where
they were, but they must all run out to see how things stood.
While it was dark, indeed, they were well enough, and they
had opportunity enough, for some hours, to view them by the

if there had been a hundred of them, to have attacked them;
but that could not be obtained; for they were some of them two

of two different nations.
After having mused a great while on the course they should
take, and beating their brains in considering their present cir—
cumstances, they resolved, at last, while it was still dark, to
send the old savage, Friday’s father, out as a spy, to learn, it
possible, something concerning them; as what they came for,
what they intended to do, and the like. The old man readily
undertook it; and stripping himself quite naked, as most of the
savages were, away he went. After he had been gone an hour
or two, he brings word that he had been among them undis-
covered; that he found they were two parties, and of two several
nations, who had war with one another, and had a great battle
in their own countr : and that both sides having had several

Friday’s father used all the arguments he could to persuade
our people to lie close, and not be seen: he told them their safety
consisted in it, and that they had nothing to do but lie still, and
the savages would kill one another to their hands, and then the
rest would go away; and it was so to a tittle. But it was impos-
sible to prevail, especially upon the Englishmen; their curiosity
was so importunate upon their prudentials, that they must run
out and see the battle: however, they used some caution too,
viz. they did not go openly, just by their own dwelling, but
went farther into the woods, and placed themselves to advantage,

place; and that, by consequence, the pursuers would do the like

stand armed within the wall, and whoever came into the grove,
they resolved to sally out over the wall and kill them: so that,
if possible, not one should return to give an account of it: they
ordered also that it should be done with their swords, or by
knocking them down with the stocks of their muskets, but not
by shooting them, for fear of raising an alarm by the noise.

terror, that they were not themselves for some weeks after.
This, as I said, tamed even the three English brutes I have
been speaking or", and, for a great while after, they were tract-
able, and went about the common business of the whole society
well enough; planted, sowed, reaped, and began to be all
naturalised to the country. But some time after this, they fell
into such simple measures again, as brought them into a great
deal of trouble.
They had taken three prisoners, as I observed; and these
three being lusty, stout young fellows, they made them servants,
and taught them to work for them; and, as slaves, they did well
enough; but they did not take their measures with them as
I did by my man Friday, viz. to begin With them upon the

seeing the savages particularly haunted that side of the island,
and that there were more remote and retired parts of it equally
adapted to their way of living, and manifestly to their advan-
tage, they should not rather move their habitation, and plant in
some more proper place for their safety, and especially for the
security of their cattle and corn.
Upon this, after long debate, it was concluded that they would
not remove their habitation; because that, some time or other,
they thought they might hear from their governor again, mean-
ing me; and if I should send any one to seek them, I should be
274 anvnsrnsss or
place demolished, they would conclude the savages had killed
us all, and we were gone; and so our supply would go too. But
as to their corn and cattle, they agreed to remove them into the
valley where my cave was, where the land was as proper for
both, and where, indeed, there was land enough: however, upon
second thoughts, they altered one part of their resolution too,
and resolved only to remove part of their cattle thither, and
plant part of their corn there; and so if one part was destroyed,
the other might be saved. And one part of prudence they used,
which it was very well they did, viz. that they never trusted
those three savages, which they had prisoners, with knowing
anything of the plantation they had made in that valley, or of
any cattle they had there, much less of the cave there, which
they kept, in case of necessity, as a safe retreat; and thither
they carried also the two barrels of powder which I had sent
them at my coming away. But, however they resolved not to
change their habitation, yet they agreed, that as I had carefully

concealed, of which they were now fully convinced, they set'to

distance before the entrance into my apartments, they went on

place to land, or any sign that there had been any landing there-
about: these stakes also being of a wood very forward to grow,
as I have noted formerly, they took care to have them enerally
much larger and taller than those which I had plantef; and as
they grew apace, so they planted them so very thick and close
together, that when they had been three or four years grown,
there was no piercing with the eye any considerable way into
the plantation: and, as for that part which I had planted, the
trees were grown as thick as a man’s thigh, and among them
they placed so many other short ones, and so thick, that, in a
'word, it stood like a palisade a quarter of a mile thick, and it
was next to impossible to penetrate it, but with a little army to
cut it all down; for a little dog could hardly get between the
trees, they stood so close.
But this was not all; for they did the same by all the ground
to the right hand and to the left, and round even to the top of
the hill, leaving no way, not so much as for themselves to come
out, but by the ladder placed up to the side of the hill, and then

and when the lad er was taken down, nothing but what had
wings, or witchcraft to assist it, could come at them. This was
excellently well contrived; nor was it less than what they after-
wards found occasion for; which served to convince me, that as
human rudence has the authority of Providence to justify it; so
it has oubtless the direction of Providence to set it to work;
and if we listened carefully to the voice of it, I am persuaded
we might prevent many of the disasters which our lives are now,
by our own negligence, subjected to: but this by the way. .
I return to the story—They lived two years after this in per-
fect retirement, and had no more visits from the savages. They
had indeed an alarm given them one morning, which put them
into a great consternation; for some of the Spaniards being out
early one morning on the west side, or rather end, of the island
(which was that end where I never went, for fear of being dis-
covered), they were surprised with seeing above twenty canoes
of Indians just coming on shore. They made the best of their
way home, in hurry enough ; and giving the alarm to their com-
rades, they kept close all that day and the next, going out only
at night to make their observation: but they had the good luck
to be mistaken; for wherever the savages went, they did not
land that time on the island, but pursued some other design.
And now they had another broil with the three Englishmen;
one of whom, a most turbulent fellow, being in a ra e at one of
the three slaves, which I mentioned they had taken, ecause the
fellow had not done something right which be bid him do, and
seemed a little untractable in his showing him, drew a hatchet
out o! a hog-belt, in which he wore it by his side, and fell “POI
the poor savage, not to correct him, but to kill him. One of the
Spaniards, who was by, seeing him give the fellow a barbarous
cut with the hatchet, which he aimed at his head, but struck
into his shoulders, so that he thought he had cut the poor crea—
278 ADVENTURIB 0?
poor man, placed himself between him and the savage, to pre-
vent the mischief. The fellow being enraged the more at this
struck at the Spaniard with his hatchet, and swore he would
serve him as he intended to serve the savage; which the Spaniard
perceiving, avoided the blow, and with a shovel which he had in
278 ADVENTURIB 0?
land) knocked e brute down. Another of the Englishmen
running at the same time to help his comrade, knocked the
Spaniard down; and then two Spaniards more came in to help
their man, and a. third Englishman fell in upon them. They had
278 ADVENTURIB 0?
and other tools, except this third Englishman; he had one of
my rusty cutlasses, with which he made at the two last
Spaniards, and wounded them both. This fray set the whole
family in an uproar, and more help coming in, they took the
three Englishmen prisoners. The next question was, what
should be done with them? They had been so often mutinous,
and were so very furious, so desperate, and so idle witha], they
knew not what course to take with them, for they were mis-
chievous to the highest degree, and valued not what hurt the
did to any man; so that, in short, it was not safe to live wit
them.
The Spaniard who was governor told them, in so many words,
that if they had been of his own country, he would have hanged
them; for all laws and all governors were to preserve society,
and those who were dangerous to the society ought to be ex-
pelled out of it; but as they were Englishmen, and that it was
to the generous kindness of an Englishman that they all owed
their reservation and deliverance, he would use them with all
possible lenity, and would leave them to the judgment of the
other two Englishmen, who were their countrymen.
One of the two honest Englishmen stood up, and said they
desired it might not be left to them; For, says he, I am sure we
ought to sentence them to the gallows: and with that he gives
an account how Will Atkins, one of the ,three, had proposed to
278 ADVENTURIB 0?
Spaniards when they were in their sleep.
When the Spanish governor heard this, he calls to Will Atkins,
How, Senhor Atkins, would you murder us all? What have you
to say to that? The hardened villain was so far from denying
it, that he said it was true: and, G—d d—n him, they would do
It still, before they had done with them. Well, but Senhor
Atkins, says the Spaniard, what have we done to you, that you
will kill us? And what would you get by killing us? And what
must we do to prevent your killing us? Must we kill you, or
you kill us? Why will you put us to the necessit of this.
Senhor Atkins? says the Spaniard very calmly an smiling.
Senhor Atkins was in such a rage at the Spaniard’s making a
'est of it, that, had he not been held by three men, and withal -
ad no Weapon near him, it was thou ht he would have attempted
to have killed the Spaniard in the mi dle of all the company. This
hairbrain carriage obliged them to consider serieusl what was
to be done: the two Englishmen, and the Spaniar who saved
the poor savage, were of the opinion that they should hang one
of the three, for an example to the rest; and that particularly it
should be he that had twice attempted to commit murder with
his hatchet; and, indeed, there was some reason to believe he
had done it, for the poor savage was in such a miserable con-
dition with the wound he had received, that it was thought he
could not live. But the governor Spaniard still said no; it was
an Englishman that had saved all their lives, and he would never
consent to put an Englishman to death, though he had murdered
half of them; nay, he said, if he had been killed himself by an
Englishman, and had time left to speak, it should be that they
should pardon him.
This was so positively insisted on by the governor Spaniard,
that there was no gainsaying it; and as merciful counsels are
most apt to prevail, where they are so earnestly pressed, so they
all came into it: but then it was to be considered what should
be done to keep them from doing the mischief they designed;
for all agreed, governor and all, that means were to be used for
preserving the society from danger. After a long debate, it was

have either gun, powder, shot, sword, or any weapon; and
should be turned out of the societ , and left to live where they
would, and how they would, by t emselves; but that none of
the rest, either Spaniards or English, should converse with them,
speak with them, or have anything to do with them : that they
should be forbid to come within a certain distance of the place
where the rest dwelt; and if they offered to commit any dis-
order, so as to spoil, burn, kill, or destroy any of the corn,
plantings, buildings, fences, or cattle belonging to the society,
they should die without mercy, and they would shoot them wher-
BONNSON CRUSOE. 271
The governor, a man )f great humanity, musing upon the
sentence, considered a little u on it; and turning to the two

long ere they can raise corn and cattle of their own, and they
must not starve ; we must therefore allow them provisions: 80
be caused to be added, that they should have a proportion oi
corn given them to last them eight months, and for seed to sets,
by which time they might be supposed to raise some of their
own; that they should have six milch-goats, four he-goats, and
six kids given them, as well for present subsistence as for a
store; and that they should have tools given them for their
278 ADVENTURES or
like; but they should have none of these tools or provisions,
unless they would swear solemnly that they would not hurt or
injure any of the Spaniards with them, or of their fellow
Englishmen.
Thus they dismissed them the society, and turned them out to
shift for themselves. They went away sullen and refractory, as
neither content to go away nor to stay; but as there was no
remedy, they went, pretending to go and choose a place where
they would settle themselves; and some provisions were given
them, but no weapons.

victuals, and gave the governor an account where they had
pitched their tents, and marked themselves out a habitation and
plantation ; and it was a very convenient place, indeed, on the
remotest part of the island, N.E., much about the place where I
278 ADVENTURES or
to sea, the Lord alone knows whither, in my foolish attempt to
sail round the island.
Here they built themselves two handsome huts, and contrived
278 ADVENTURES or
side of a hill, having some trees growing already on three sides
of it, so that by planting others, it would be very easily covered
from the sight, unless narrowly searched for. They desired
some dried goats’-skins, for beds and covering, which were given
them; and upon giving their words that they would not disturb
the rest, or injure any of their plantations, they gave them
hatchets, and what other tools they could spare; some peas,
barley, and rice, for sowing; and, in a word, anything they
wanted, exce t arms and ammunition. .
They live in this separate condition about six months, and
278 ADVENTURES or
the parcel of land they had planted being but little; for, indeed,
having all their plantation to form, they had a great deal of
work upon their hands; and when they came to make boards
and pots, and such things, they were quite~out of their element,
and could make nothing of it: and when the rainy season came
on, for want of a cave in the earth, they could not keep their
grain dry, and it was in great danger of spoiling; and this
humbled them much: so they came and begged the Spaniards
to help them, which they very readily did; and in four days
worked a great hole in the side of the hill for them, big enough
to secure their corn and other things from the rain: but it was
but a poor place, at best, compared to mine, and especially as
mine was then, for the Spaniards had greatly enlarged it, and
made several new apartments in it.
About three-quarters of a year after this separation, a new
frolic took these rogues, which, together with the former villan;
they had committed, brought mischief enough upon them, and
had very near been the ruin of the whole colony. The three
new associates began, it seems, to be weary of the laborious life
they led, and that without hope of bettering their circumstances ;
and a whim took them, that they would make a voyage to the
continent, from whence the savages came, and would try if they
could seize upon some prisoners among the natives there, and
bring them home, so to make them do the laborious part of their
work for them.
The project was not so preposterous, if they had gone no
farther: but they did nothing, and proposed nothing, but had
either mischief in the design, or mischief in the event: and, it
I may give my opinion, they seemed to be under a blast from
Heaven ; for if we will not allow a visible curse to pursue visible
crimes, how shall we reconcile the events of things with the
divine justice? It was certainly an apparent vengeance on their
crime of mutiny and piracy that brought them to the state they
were in; and they showed not the least remorse for the crime,
but added new villanies to it, such as the piece of monstrous
cruelty of wounding a poor slave, because he did not, or perhaps
could not, understand to do what he was directed, and to wound
him in 'such a manner as made him a cripple all his life, and in a
place where no surgeon or medicine could be had for his cure:
and what was still worse, the murderous intent, or, to do justice
to the crime, the intentional murder, for such to be sure it was,
as was afterwards the formed design they all laid, to murder the
Spaniards in cold blood, and in their sleep.




SECTION XXXV.
THE MUTINOUS ENGLISHMEN ARE DISMISSED FROM THE ISLAND—
RETURN WITH SEVERAL CAPTIVE SAVAGES—TAKE THE FEMALES
AS WIVES—ARRIVAL 0F SAVAGES.
BUT I leave observing, and return to the story.—The three
fellows came down to the Spaniards one morning, and in very
humble terms desired to be admitted to speak with them; the
Spaniards very readily heard what they had to say, which was
this :—That they were tired of living in the manner they did;
and that they were not handy enough to make the necessaries
they wanted, and that having no help, theyfound they should be
starved; but if the Spaniards would give them leave to take one
of the canoes which they came over in, and give them arms and
ammunition proportioned to their defence, they would go over to
the main and seek their fortunes, and so deliver them from the
trouble of supplying them with any other provisions.
The Spaniards were glad enough to get rid of them, but very
honestly represented to them the certain destruction they were
280 anvanruaas or
that very spot, that they could, without any spirit of prophecy,
tell them they would be starved, or murdered, and bade them
consider of it.
The men replied audaciously, they should be starved if they
stayed here, for theyscould not work, and would not work, and
they could but be starved abroad; and if they were murdered,
there was an end of them; they had no wives or children to cry
after them: and, in short, insisted imporlunately upon their
demand; declaring they would go, whether they would give
them any arms or no.
The Spaniards told them, with great kindness that if the)
were resolved to go, they should not go like naked men, and be
in no condition to defend themselves: and that though they

and a great basket of dried grapes, a pot of fresh water, and a

over the sea, where it was at least forty miles broad.
The boat, indeed, was a large one, and would very well have

nonwsou causon. 28!
with them, they did well enough. They had made a mast of a
long pole, and a sail of four large g0ats'-skins dried, which they
had sewed or laced together; and away they went merrily
enough: the Spaniards called after them, Buen viage ; and no man
ever thought of seeing them any more.
The Spaniards were often saying to one another, and to the
two honest Englishmen who remained behind, how quietly and
comfortably they lived, now these three turbulent fellows were
gone: as for their coming again, that was the remotest thing
from their thoughts that could be imagined; when, behold, after
two-and—twenty days' absence, one of the Englishmen, being
abroad upon his planting work, sees three strange men coming
towards him at a distance, with guns upon their shoulders.
Away runs the Englishman, as if he was bewitched, comes
frightened and amazed to the governor Spaniard, and tells him
they were all undone, for there were strangers landed upon the
island, but could not tell who. The Spaniard, pausing a while,
says to him, How do you mean, you cannot tell who? They are
the savages, to be sure.—-No, no, says the Englishman; the
are men in clothes, with arms—Nay, then, says the Spaniar ,
why are you concerned? If they are not savages, they must be
friends; for there is no Christian nation upon earth but will do
us good rather than harm.
While they were debating thus, came the three Englishmen,
and standing without the wood, which was new planted, hallooed
to them : they presently knew their voices, and so all the wonder
of that kind ceased. But now the admiration was turned upon
another question, viz., What could be the matter, and what made
them come back again?
It was not long before they brought the men in, and inquiring
where they had been, and what they had been 'doing, they gave
them a full account of their voyage in a few words, viz. That .
the reached the land in two days, or something less; but

a great opening, by which they perceived that the land they saw
from our island was not the main, but an island; upon entering
that opening of the sea, they saw another island on the right
hand, north, and several more west; and being resolved to land
somewhere, they put over to one of the islands which lay west,
and went boldly on shore : that they found the people very
courteous and friendly to them; and that they gave them several
282 anvm'rvaas or
women as well as the men were very forward to supply them
with anything they could get for them to eat, and brought it to
them a great way upon their heads.
They continued here four days ; and inquired, as well as they
could of them, by signs, what nations were this way, and that
282 anvm'rvaas or
lived almost every way, who, as they made known by signs to
them, used to eat men; but as for themselves, they said, they
never ate men or women, except only such as they took in the
wars; and then, they owned, they made a great feast, and ate
their prisoners. ~
The Englishmen inquired when they had had a feast of that
kind; and they told them about two moons ago, pointing to the
282 anvm'rvaas or
hundred prisoners now, which he had taken in his war, and they
were feeding them to make them fat for the next feast. The
Englishmen seemed mighty desirous o! seeing those prisoners;
but the others mistaking them, thought they were desirous to
have some of them to carry away for their own eating: so they
beckoned to them, pointing to the setting of the sun, and then
to the rising; which was to signify that the next morning at
sun-rising they would bring some for them; and, accordingly,
282 anvm'rvaas or
men, and gave them to the Englishmen, to carry with them on
their voyage, just as we would bring so many cows and oxen
down to a seaport town to victual a ship.
As brutish and barbarc us as these fel ows were at home, their
stomachs turned at this Sight, and they did not know what to do.
To refuse the prisoners would have been the highest affront to
the savage gentry that could be offered them, and what to do
with them they knew not. However, after some debate, they
resolved to accept of them; and, in return, they gave the
savages that brought them one of their hatchets, an o d key, a
knife, and six or seven of their bullets ; which, though they did
not understand their use, they seemed particularly leased
with; and then tying the poor creatures’ hands behin them,
the dragged the prisoners into the boat for our men.
\ e Englishmen were obliged to come away as soon as they
had them, or else they that gave them this noble present would
certainly have expected that they should have gone to work
with them, have killed two or three of them the next morning,
and perhaps have invited the donors to dinner. But having
taken their leave, with all the respect and thanks that could
well pass between people, where, on either side, they under-
stood not one word they could say, they put off with their boat,

arrived, they set eight of their prisoners at liberty, there being
too many of them for their occasion.
In their voyage, they endeavoured to have some communi-
cation with their prisoners; but it was impossible to make them
understand anything; nothing they could say to them, or give
them, or do for them, but was looked upon as going to murder

the knife at their throats ; for they immediately concluded they

them quite over, and begun to use them kindly, and treat them
well, still they expected every day to make a dinner or supper
for their new masters.
When the three wanderers had given this unaccountable
history or journal of their voyage, the Spaniard asked them
where their new family was; and being told that they had
brought them on shore, and put them into one of their huts,
and were come up to beg some victuals for them, they (the
Spaniards) and the other two Englishmen, that is to say, the
whole colony, resolved to go all down to the place and see
them; and did so, and Friday’s father with them.
When they came into the but, there they sat all bound; for
when they had brought them on shore, they bound their hands,
that they might not take the boat and make their escape;
there, I say, they sat, all of them stark naked. First, there
were three men, lusty, comely fellows, well-shaped, straight

women, whereof two might be from thirty to forty; two more

maiden, about sixteen or seventeen. The women were well-
favoured, agreeable persons, both in shape and features, only
tawny; and two of them, had they been perfect white, would
have passed for very handsome women, even in London itself,
having pleasant agreeable countenancss, and of a very modest
behaviour: especially when they came afterwards to be clothed
U
and dressed, as they called it, though that dress was very
indifferent, it must be confessed; of which hereafter.
The sight, you may be sure, was something uncouth to our
Spaniards, who were, to give them a just character, men of the
best behaviour, of the most calm, sedate tempers, and perfect
good humour, that ever I met with; and, in particular, of the
most modest, as will presently appear: I say, the sight was

if he understood any of their speech. As soon as the old man
came in, he looked seriously at them, but knew none of them;
neither could any of them understand a word he said, or a sign
he could make, except one of the women. However, this was
enough to answer the end, which was to satisfy them that the
men into whose hands they were fallen were Christians; that
they abhorred eating men or women; and that they might be
sure they would not be killed. As soon as they were assured
of this, they discovered such a joy, and by such awkward ges-
tures, several ways, as is hard to describe; for, it seems, they
were of several nations.
The woman who was their interpreter was bid, in the next
place, to ask them if they were willing to be servants, and to work
for the men who had brought them away, to save their lives; at
which they all fell a dancing; and presently one fell to taking
up this, and another that, any thing that lay next, to carry on
their shoulders, to intimate that they were willing to work.
The governor, who found that the having women among
them would presently be attended with some inconvenience,
and might occasion some strife, and perhaps blood, asked the
three men what they intended to do with these women, and how
they intended to use them, whether as servants or as women?
One of the Englishmen answered very boldly and readil , that
they would use them as both; to which the governor sai , I am
not going to restrain you from it; you are your own masters as
to that; but this I think is but just, for avoiding disorders and
quarrels among you, and I desire it of you for that reason only,
viz. that you will all engage, that if any of on take any of these
women, as a woman or wife, that he shal take but one: and
that having taken one, none else shall touch her; for though we
cannot marry any one of you, yet it is but reasonable that while
you stay here, the woman any of you takes should be main-
tained by the man that takes her, and should be his wife; I
mean, says he, while he continues here, and that none else shall
here anything to do with her. All this appeared so just, that
ROBINSON causes, 2415
Then the Englishmen asked the Spaniards if they designed to
take any of them? But every one of them answered no : some
of them said they had wives in Spain, and the others did not
like women that were not Christians: and all together declared
that they would not touch one of them: which was an instance
of such virtue as I have not met with in all my travels. On the

one a wife, that is to say, a temporary wife: and so they set up
a new form of living; for the Spaniards and F riday’s father lived
in my old habitation, which they had enlarged exceedingly within.
The three servants which were taken in the late battle of the
savages lived with them; and these carried on the main part of
the colony, supplied all the rest with food, and assisted them in
anything as they could, or as they found necessity required.

than the others: but they took a good way enough to prevent

laughed at it: but the fellow considered better than any of them,
that it was application and business they were to expect assist-
ance in, as much as in anything else; and she proved the best
Wife of all the parcel.
When the poor women saw themselves set in a row thus, and
fetched out one by one, the terrors of their condition returned
ROBINSON causes, 2415
to be devoured. Accordingly, when the English sailor came in
and fetched out one of them, the rest set up a most lamentable
cry, and hung about her, and took their leave of her with such
ROBINSON causes, 2415
in the world; nor was it possible for the Englishmen to satisfy
them that they were not to be immediately murdered, till they
fetched the old man, Friday's father, who immediately let them

had chosen them for their wives.
When they had done, and the fright the women were in was
a. little over, the men went to work, and the Spaniards came and
helped them; and in a few hours they had built them every one
U 2
a new hut or tent for their lodging apart; for those they had
already were crowded with their tools, household stuff, and pr0~
visions. The three wicked ones had pitched farthest off, and the
two honest ones nearer, but both on the north shore of the
island, so that they continued separated as before; and thus my
island was peopled in three places; and, as I might say, three
towns were begun to be built.
And here it is very well worth observing, that, as it often
happens in the world (what the wise ends of God's providence
are, in such a disposition of things, Icannot say), the two honest
fellows had the two worst wives; and the three reprobates, that
‘286 anvsx'rimrs or
seemed born to do themselves good, nor any one else, had three
‘286 anvsx'rimrs or
two were bad wives, as to their temper or humour, for all the
‘286 anvsx'rimrs or
rather like slaves than wives; but my meaning is, they were
not alike capable, ingenious, or industrious, or alike cleanly
and neat.
Another observation I must make, to the honour of a diligent
application, on one hand, and to the disgrace of a slothful,
negligent, idle temper, on the other, that when I came to the
place, and viewed the several improvements, plantings, and
management of the several little colonies, the two men had so
far outgone the three, that there was no comparison. They had,
indeed, both of them as much ound laid out for corn as they
wanted, and the reason was, ecause, according to my rule,
nature dictated that it was to no pu ose to sow more com than
they wanted; but the difference of t e cultivation, of the plant-
ing, of the fences, and, indeed, of every thing else, was easy to
‘286 anvsx'rimrs or
The two men had innumerable young trees planted about their
huts, so that when you came to the place, nothing was to be
seen but wood: and though they had twice had their plantation
demolished, once by their own countrymen, and once by the
enemy, as shall be shown in its place, yet they had restored all
‘286 anvsx'rimrs or
they had grapes planted in order, and managed like a vineyard,
though they had themselves never seen anything of that kind;
and by their good ordering their vines, their grapes were as good
again as any of the others. They had also foun themselves out
a retreat in the thickest part of the woods, where, though there
was not a natural cave, as I had found, yet they made one with
incessant labour of their hands, and where, when the mischief
which followed happened, they secured their w1ves and children,
so as they could never be found; they having, by sticking innu-
merable stakes and poles of the wood which, as I aid, grew so
readily, made the grove unpassable, except in some places when:
they climbed up to get over the outside part, and then went on
by ways of their own leaving.
As to the three reprobates, as Ijustly call them, though they

were before, and were not so quarrelsome, having not the same

mind never lett them, and that was their idleness. It is true,
they planted corn, and made fences; but Solomon’s words were

the slothful, and it was all overgrown with thorns ;" for when
the Spaniards came to view their crop, they could not see it in
some places for weeds, the hedge had several gaps in it, where
the wild goats had got in and eaten up the corn; perhaps here
and there a dead bush was crammed in, to stop them out for the
present, but it was only shutting the stable-door after the steed
was stolen: whereas, when they looked on the colony of the
other two, there was the very face of industry and success upon
all they did; there was not a weed to be seen in all their corn,
or a gap in any of their hedges; and they, on the other hand,
roamson causoa. ' 287
hand maketh rich ;” for every thing grew and thrived, and they
had plenty within and without; they had more tame cattle than
the others, more utensils and necessaries within doors, and yet
more pleasure and diversion too.
It is true, the wives of the three were very handy and cleanly
within doors, and having learned the English ways of dressing
and cooking from one of the other Englishmen, who, as I said,
was a cook’s mate on board the ship, they dressed their hus-
bands’ victuals very nicely and well ; whereas the others could
not be brought to understand it : but then the husband, who, as
I say, had been cook’s mate, did it himself. But as for the bus-
bands of the three wives, they loitered about, fetched turtles‘
roamson causoa. ' 287
and they fared accordingly. The diligent lived well and com-
fortably; and the slothful lived hard and beggarly; and so, I
believe, generally speaking, it is all over the world.
But I now come to a scene different from all that had hap-
pened before, either to them or to me; and the original of the
roamson causoa. ' 287
six canoes of Indians or savages, call them which you please,
and there is no room to doubt they came upon the old errand of
feeding upon their slaves; but that part was now so familiar to
the Spaniards, and to our men too, that they did not concern
themselves about it, as I did: but having been made sensible,
by their experience, that their only business was to lie concealed,
and that if they were not seen by any of the savages, they would
go off again quietly, when their business was done, having, as
yet, not the least notion of there being any inhabitants in the
island ; i say, having been made sensible of this, they had nothing
to do but 've notice to all the three plantations to keep withii:
doors, an not show themselves, only placing a scout in a pro-
per place, to give notice when the boats went to sea again.
This was, without doubt, very right; but a disaster spoiled
all these measures, and made it known among the savages that
there were inhabitants there; which was, in the end, the desola-
tion of almost the whole colony. After the canoes with the
288 ADVENTURES OF
some of them had the curiosity to go to the place where they
had been, to see what they had been doing). Here, to their great
288 ADVENTURES OF
asleep upon the ground, It was supposed they had either been
so gorged with their inhuman feast, that, like beasts, they were
fallen asleep, and would not stir when the others went, or they
had wandered into the woods, and did not come back in time to
be taken in.
The Spaniards were greatly surprised at this sight, and per-
fectly at a loss what to do. The Spanish governor, as it hap-
pened, was with them, and his advice was asked, but he professed
he knew not what to do. As for slaves, they had enough alread} :
and as to killing them, they were none of them inclined to that:
the Spanish governor told me, they could not think of shedding
innocent blood: for as to them, the poor creatures had done
them no wrong, invaded none of their property, and the thought
the had no just quarrel against them, to take away t eir lives.
An here I must, in justice to these Spaniards, observe, that let
the accounts of Spanish cruelty in Mexico and Peru be what
they will, I never met with seventeen men of any nation what-
soever, in any foreign country, who were so universally modest,
temperate, virtuous, so very good-humoured, and so courteous,
as these Spaniards ; and as to cruelty, they had nothing of it in
their very nature: no inhumanity, no barbarity, no outrageous
passions ; and yet all of them men of great courage and spirit.
Their temper and calmness had appeared in their bearing the
insufferable usage of the three Englishmen; and their jutice
and humanity appeared now in the case of the sava es, as above.
After some consultation, they resolved upon this: that they
would lie still a while longer, till, if possible, these three m I!
might be gone, But then the governor Spaniard recollectr d,
that the three savages had no boat; and if they were left to rova
about the island, they would certainly discover that there were
inhabitants in it; and so they should be undone that way. Upon
this they went back a ain, and there lay the fellows fast asleep
still, and so they reso ved to waken them, and take them pri-
soners; and they did so. The poor fellows were strange]
frightened when they were seized upon and bound; and afraid:
like the women, that they should be murdered and eaten : for it
seems those people think all the world does as they do, eating
aonmsos sensors. 289
they carried them.
It was ver happy for them that they did not carry them home

corn, &c.; and afterwards they carried them to the habitation
of the two Englishmen.
Here they were set to work, though it was not much they had
for them to do; and whether it was by negli ence in guarding
them, or that they thought the fellows coul not mend them-
selves, ! know not, but one of them run away, and taking to the
woods, they could never hear of him any more.
They had good reason to believe he got home again soon after,
in some other boots or canoes of savages who came on shore
three or four weeks afterwards ; and who, carrying on their revels

exceedingly; for they concluded, and that not without good
cause indeed, that if this fellow came home safe among his com-
rades, he would certainly give them an account that there were
people in the island, and also how few and weak they were: for
this savage, as I observed before, had never been told, and it was
very happy he had not, how many there were, or where they

much less had they shown him any of their other retired places;
such as the cave in the valley, or the new retreat which the
two Englishmen had made, and the like.

ligence of them was, that, about two months after this, six canoes
of savages, with about seven, eight, or ten men in a canoe, came
rowing along the north side of the island, where they never used
to come before, and landed, about an hour after sunrise, at a
convenient place, about a. mile from the habitation of the two
Englishmen, where this escaped man had been kept. As the
Spaniard governor said, had they been all there, the damage
would not have been so much, for not a man of them would have
aonmsos sensors. 289

discover them about a league off, so that it was above an hour
before they landed; and as they landed a mile from their huts,
it was some time before they could come at them. Now, having

they did was to bind the two s aves which were left, and cause
two of the three men whom they brought with the women (who,
it seems, proved very faithful to them) to lead them, with their
two wives, and whatever they could carry away with them, to
their retired places in the woods, which I have spoken of above,
and there to bind the two fellows hand and foot. till they hard
further.
In the next place, seeing the savages were all come on shore,
and that they had bent their course directly that way, they
opened the fences where the milch goats were kept, and drove
them all out; leaving their goats to straggle in the woods,
whither they pleased, that the savages might think they were all
bred wild; but the rogue who came with them was too cunning
for that, and gave them an account of it all, for they went
directly to the place. 7
When the two poor frightened men had secured their wives
and goods, they sent the other slave they had of the three who
came with the women, and who was at their place by accident,
away to the Spaniards with all speed, to give them the alarm,
and desire speedy help; and, in the mean time, they took their
arms and what ammunition they had, and retreated towards the
place in the wood where their wives were sent; keeping at a
distance, yet so that they might see, if possible, which way the
savages took.
They had not gone far, but that from a rising ground they
could see the little army of their enemies come on directly to
their habitation, and, in a monent more, could see all their huts

290 ADVENTURES or
at least for some time. They kept their station for a while, till
they found the savages, like wild beasts, spread themselves all
over the place, rummaging ever way and every place they could
think of, in search of prey; an in particular for the people, of
whom, now, it plainly appeared they had intelligence.
The two Englishmen seeing this, thinking themselves not
secure where they stood, because it was likely some of the wild
people might come that way, and they might come too many
together, thought it proper to make another retreat about half a
mile farther; believing, as it afterwards happened, that the
farther they strolled the fewer would be together.


SECTION XXXVI.
IIVERAL SAVAGFS KILLED; THE REMAINDER LEAVE THE ISLAND.—
A FLEET OF THEM AFTERWARDS ARRIVE—A GENERAL BATTLE.—
THE SAVAGES ARE OVERCOME, AND TRANQUILLITY RESTORED.
THEIR next halt was at the entrance into a very thick-grown part
of the woods, and where an old trunk of a tree stood, which was
hollow and vastly large; and in this tree they both took their
standing, resolving to see there what might offer. The had not

they ran every way, like sportsmen heating for their game.

to deal with, then they would get up to the top of the tree, from

into his piece; and having a fair loophole, as it were, from a
broken hole in the tree, he took a sure aim, without being seen,
waiting till they were within about thirty yards of the tree, so
that he could not miss.
While they were thus waiting. and the savages came on, they
plainly saw that one of the three was the runaway savage that
had escaped from them; and they both knew him distinctly, and
resolved that, if possible, he should not escape, though they

However, all being silent again, and they not knowing what
the matter was, came on unconcerned, till they came to the place
where their companions lay, in a condition miserable enough;
and here the poor ignorant creatures, not sensible that they were
within reach of the same mischief, stood all of a huddle over the

him how he came to be hurt; and who, it is very rational to

that was hurt not at all came and kneeled down to them, with
his two hands held up, and made piteous moans to them, by
gestures and signs, for his life, but could not say one word to
them that they could understand. Hewever, they made signs
to him to sit down at the foot of a tree hard by; and one of the
Englishmen, with a piece of rope twined, which he had by great
chance in his pocket, tied his two hands behind him, and there
they left him: and with what speed they could made after the
other two, which were gone before, fearin they, or any more

came once in sight of the two men, but it was at a great dis-
tance; however, they had the satisfaction to see them cross over
a valley towards the sea, quite the contra way from that which
led to their retreat, which they were afrai of; and being satis-
tied with that, they went back to the tree where they left their
risoner, who, as they supposed, was delivered by his comrades,
or he was gone, and the two pieces of rope-yarn, with which
they had bound him, lay just at the foot of the tree. ‘
They were now in as great concern as betore, not knowing
what course to take, or how near the enemy might be, or in
what numbers: so they resolved to go away to the place where
their wives were, to see if all was wel‘ there, and to make them
'294 ammonia or
any, who Were in fright enough, to be sure; for though the
savages were their own countryfolk, yet they Were most terribly
afraid of them, and perhaps t e more for the knowledge they
had of them. _
When they came there, they found the savages had been in
the Wood, and very near that place, but had not found it: for it
was indeed inaccessible, by the trees standing so thick, as before,
unless the ersons seeking it had been directed by those that
knew it, w ich these did not: they found, therefore, every thing
very safe, only the women in a terrible fright. While they were
here, they had the comfort to have seven of the Spaniards come
to their assistance: the other ten, with their servants, and old
Frida , I-mean Friday’s father, were gone in a body to defend
their bower, and the corn and cattle that was kept there, in case
the savages should have roved over to that side of the country;
but they did not spread so far. With the seven S aniards came
one of the three savages who, as I said, were t eir prisoners
formerl ; and with them also came the savage whom the English-
men ha left bound hand and foot at the tree: for it seems, they
came that way, saw the slaughter of the seven men, and un-
bound the eighth, and brought him along with them; where,
however, the were obliged to bind him again, as they had the
two others w 0 were left when the third ran away.
The prisoners now began to be a burthen to them; and they
were so afraid of their escaping, that they were once resolving
to kill them all, believing they were under an absolute necessity
to do so, for their own preservation. However, the Spaniard
governor would not consent to it; but ordered, for the present,
that they should be sent out of the way, to my old cave in the
valley, and be kept there, with two Spaniards to guard them,
and give them food for their subsistence, which was done; and
they were bound there hand and foot for that night.
When the Spaniards came, the two Englishmen were so en-
couraged, that they could not satisfy themselves to stay any

though with all possible caution, to go forward, towards their
ruined plantation; but a little before they came thither, coming
in 515M 01' the sea-shore, they saw plainly the savages all cm-
barked again in their canoes, in order to be gone. They seemed

them a parting blow; but, upon the whole, they were very well
ROBINSON cnvsoa. .295
The poor Englishmen being new twice mined, and all their
improvements destroyed, the rest all agreed to come and help
them to rebuild, and to assist them with needful supplies. Their
three countrymen, who were not yet noted for having the least
inclination to do any good, yet as soon as they heard of it (for
they living remote eastward, knew nothing of the matter till all
was over), came and offered their help and assistance, and did,
very friendly, work for several days, to restore their habitation,
and make necessaries for them. And thus, in a little time, they
were “set upon their legs again.
About two days after this, they had the further satisfaction of
seeing three of the savages’ canoes come driving on shore, and,
at some distance from them, two drowned men: by which they
had reason to believe that they had met with a storm at sea,
which had overset some of them ; for it had blown very hard the
night after they went off.
However, as some might miscarry, so, on the other hand,
enough of them escaped to inform the rest, as well of what they
had done as of what had happened to them, and to whet them
on to another enterprise of the same nature; which they, it

better; when, on a sudden, they were invaded with a most for-

savages, armed with bows and arrows, great clubs, wooden
swords, and such-like engines of war; and they brought such
numbers with them, that, in short, it put all our people into the
utmost consternation.
As they came on shore in the evening, and at the easternmost
side of the island, our men had that night to consult and con-

go directly thither, as soon as it was day, to play the old game
over again, though they did not now land within two leagues of

Spaniards; and, in short, left as little appearance of inhabitants
any where as was possible: and the next morning early they
posted themselves, with all their force, at the plantation of the
two men, to wait for their coming. As they guessed, so it hap-
pened: these new invaders leaving their canoes at the east end
of the island, came ranging along the shore, directly towards the

wickedness, was a. most daring, bold fel ow, commanded under
him. The savages came forward like lions; and our men, which
was the worst of their fate, had no advantage in their situation;
only that Will Atkins, who now proved a most useful fellow

Had Will Atkins and his men retired immediately, as soon as

savages had been effectually routed; for the terror that was
amdng them came principally from this, viz. that they were
killed by the gods with thunder and lightning, and could see
nobody that hurt them; but Will Atkins, staying to load again,
discovered the cheat; some of the savages who were atadistance
spying them, came upon them behind; and though Atkins and

arrows, as they did afterwards one Spaniard, and one of the
Indian slaves who came with the women. This slave was a

Englishman that were killed behind them; and the savages,
when they came up to them, killed them over again in a wretched
manner, breaking their arms, legs, and heads, with their clubs

But as it was a clear moonlight night, and they found the
savages in great disorder about their dead and wounded men,
and a great noise and hurry among them where they lay, they
afterwards resolved to fall upon them in the night; especially
if they could come to give them but one volley before they were
discovered, which they had a fair opportunity to do; for one of

The Spaniards charged again with the utmost expedition, and
then divided themselves in three bodies, and resolved to fall in
among them all together. They had in each body eight persons,
that is to say, twenty-two and the two women, who, by the way,

the women kept back, but they said they were resolved to die
with their husbands. Having thus formed their little army,
they marched out from among the trees, and came up to the
teeth of the enemy, shouting and hallooing as loud as they
could; the savages stood altogether, but were in the utmost
confusion, hearing the noise of our men shouting from three
quarters together: they would have fought if they had seen us;
for as soon as we came near enough to be seen, some arrows
were shot, and poor old Friday was wounded, though not
dangerously; but our men gave them no time, but, running up

through the woods and over the hills, with all the speed fear and

where they landed, and where their canoes lay. But their dis-
asters were not at an end yet; for it blew a terrible storm of wind
that evening from the Sea, so'that it was impossible for them to
go off; nay, the storm continuing all night, wnen the tide came.

case; for their own savages, who were their servants, dispatched
these poor creatures with their hatchets.
At length, they came in view of the place where the more

and they had all gone away to sea; but they did not then con-
sider that this might probably have been the occasion of their
coming again in such multitudes as not to be resisted, or, at
least, to come so many, and so often, as would quite desolate
the island. and starve them. Will Atkins, therefore, who, not-
withstanding his wound, kept always with them, proved the best
counsellor in this case: his advice was, to take the advantage
that offered, and clap in between them and their boats and so

deprive them of the capacity of ever returning any more to
plague the island.
They consulted long about this; and some were against it,

and, in short, be reduced to a life of continual distress.
Will Atkins told them they had better have to do with a
hundred men than with a hundred nations: that as they must
destroy their boats, so they must destroy the men, or be all of
them destroyed themselves. In a word, he showed them the
necessity of it so plainly, that they all came into it: so they went
to work immediately with the boats, and getting some dry wood
together from a dead tree, they tried to set some of them on
300 ADVENTURES OF

for swimming in the sea as boats. When the Indians saw what
they were about, some of them came running out of the woods,
and coming as near as they could to our men, kneeled down
and cried, “ 0a, 0a, Waramokoa,” and some other words of their
language, which none of the others understood any thing of ;
but as they made pitiful gestures and strange noises, it was easy
to understand they beg ed to have their boats spared, and that
they would be gone, and never come there again. But our men

people from ever going home again: depending upon this, that
if even so much as one of them got back into their country to
tell the stor , the colony was undone: so that, letting them
know that t ey should not have any mercy, they fell to work
with their canoes, and destroyed them every one that the storm
had not destroyed before; at the sight of which the savages
raised a hideous cry in the woods, which our people heard plain
enough, after which they ran about the island like distracted
300 ADVENTURES OF
what to do with them. Nor did the Spaniards, with all their
prudence, consider, that while they made those people thus
desperate, they ought to have kept a good guard at the same
time upon their plantations; for though, it is true, they had

main retreat, I mean my old castle at the hill, nor the cave in
the valley, yet they found out my plantation at the bower, and
pulled it all to pieces, and all the fences and planting about it;
trod all the corn under foot, tore up the vines and grapes, being
just then almost ripe, and did our men an inestimable damage,
though to themselves not one farthing's worth of service.
300 ADVENTURES OF
yet they were in no condition to pursue them, or hunt them up
and down; for as they were too nimble of foot for our men,
when they found them single, so our men durst not go abroad
single, for fear of being surrounded with their numbers. The
best was, they had no weapons; for though they had how, they
had no arrows left, nor any materials to make any; nor had
they any edge-tool or weapon among them.
' The extremity and distress they were reduced- to was great
and indeed deplorable; but, at the same time, our men were
also brought to very bad circumstances by them: for though
their retreats were preserved, yet their provision was destroyed,
and their harvest spoiled; and what to do, or which way to turn
themselves, they knew not. The only refuge they had now was,
the stock of cattle they had in the valley by the cave, and some
little corn which grew there, and the plantation of the three
Englishmen, Will Atkins and his comrades, who were now re-
duced to two; one of them being killed by an arrow, which
struck him on the side of his head, just under the temples, so
that he never spoke more: and it was very remarkable, that
this was the same barbarous fellow that cut the poor savage
slave with his hatchet, and who afterwards intended to have
murdered the Spaniards.

plant, and live upon their daily labour.

an Indian, if he did not hit him, yet he would fall down for fear;
and so dreadfully frightened they were, that they kept out of
sight farther and farther; till, at last, our men following them,
and almost every day killing or wounding some of them, they
kept up in the woods or hollow places so much, that it reduced
them to the utmost misery for want of food; and many were
afterwards found dead in the woods, without any hurt, abso-
Lutel starved to death.
W en our men found this, it made their hearts relent, and pity
moved them, especially the Spaniard governor, who was the ma
gentleman-like, generous-minded man that I ever met with in
my life; and he proposed, if possible, to take one of them alive,
and bring him to understand what they meant, so far as to be
able to act as interpreter, and go among them, and see if they
might be brought to some conditions that might be depended
upon, to save their lives and do us no harm.
It was some while before any of them could be taken; but
being weak and half-starved, one of them was at last surprised
802 ADVENTURES or

given him, and no violence offered him, he at last grew tractable,
and came to himself. They brought old Friday to him, who
talked often with him, and told him how kind the others would
be to them all; that they would not only save their lives, but
would give them part of the island to live in, provided they would
give satisfaction that they would keep in their own bounds and
not come beyond it to injure or prejudice others; and that they
should have corn given them to plant and make it grow for their
bread, and some bread given them for their present subsistence;
and old Friday bade the fellow go and talk with the rest of his
countrymen, and see what they said to it; assuring them, that
if they did not agree immediately, they should be all destroyed.
The poor wretches, thoroughly humbled, and reduced in
number to about thirty-seven, closed with the proposal at the
802 ADVENTURES or
twelve Spaniards and two Englishmen, well armed, with three
Indians slaves and old Friday, marched to the place where they
were. The three Indians slaves carried them a large quantity of
bread, some rice boiled up to cakes and dried in the sun, and
three live goats; and they were ordered to go to the side of a
hill, where they sat down, ate their provisions very thankfully,
and were the most faithful fellows to their words that could be
thought of; for, except when they came to beg victuals and
directions, they never came out of their bounds: and there they
lived when I came to the island, and I went to see them.
They had taught them both to plant corn, make bread, breed
tame goats, and milk them: they wanted nothing but wives,

lying plain towards the sea before them, on the south-east corner
of the island. They had land enough, and it was very good and
fruitful; about a mile and a half broad, and three or four miles
in length.
Our men taught them to make wooden s ades, such as I made
for myself, and gave among them twelve atchets and three or
four knives; and there they lived, the most subjected innocent
creatures that ever were heard of.
ROBINSON ('RUSOE. 303
spect to the savages till I came to revisit them, which was about
two years after; not but that, now and then, some canoes of
savages came on shore for their triumphal, unnatural feasts; but
as they were of several nations, and perhaps had never heard of
those that came before, or the reason of it, they did not make
any search or inquiry after their countrymen; and if they had,
it would have been very hard to have found them out.
Thus, I think, I have given a full account of all that happened
to 'them till my return, at least, that was worth notice. The
Indians or savages were wonderfully civilized by them, and they
frequently went among them; but forbade, on pain of death, any
ane of the Indians coming to them, because they would not have
their settlement betrayed again. One thing was very remark-
able, viz. that they taught the savages to make wicker-work, or
baskets, but they soon outdid their masters; for they made
abundance ofmost ingenious things in wicker-work, particularly
all sorts of baskets, sieves, birdcages, cupboards, &c.; as also
chairs to sit on, stools, beds, couches, and abundance of other
things, being very ingenious at such work, when they were once
put in the way of it.
My coming was a particular relief to these people, because we
furnished them with knives, scissors, spades, shovels, pick-axes,
and all things of that kind which they could want. With the
help of those tools they were so very handy, that they came at
last to build up their huts, or houses, very handsomely, raddling
or working it up like basket-work all the way round: which was
a very extraordinary piece of ingenuity, and looked very odd,
but was an exceeding good fence, as well against heat as against
all sorts of vermin; and our men were so taken with it, that they
got the wild savages to come and do the like for them; so that
when I came to see the two Englishmen’s colonies, they looked,
at a distance, as if they all lived like bees in a hive. As for Will
Atkins, who was now become a very industrious, useful, and
sober fellow, he had made himself such a tent of basket-work as,
I believe, was never seen: it was one hundred and twenty paces
round on the outside, as I measured by my steps; the walls were
as close worked as a basket, in panels or squares of thirty-two
in number, and verystrong, standing about seven feet high;
in the middle was another not above twenty-two paces round,
but built stronger, being octagon in its form, and in the eight
corners stood eight very strong posts; round the top of which
he laid strong pieces, pinned together with wooden pins, from
which he raised a pyramid for a roof of eight rafters, very hand-
some, I assure you, and joined together very well, though he
had no nails, and only a few iron spikes, which he made himself
too, out of the old iron that I had left there; and, indeed, this fellow
showed abundance of ingenuity in several things which he had
no knowledge of: he made him a forge, with a pair of wooden
304 ADVENTURES 0?
and he formed out of the iron crows a middling good anvil to
hammer upon: in this manner he made many things, but espe-
cially hooks, staples and spikes, bolts and hinges—But, to
return to the house. After he had pitched the roof of his inner-
most tent, he worked it up between the rafters with basket-work,
304 ADVENTURES 0?
straw, and over that a large leaf of a tree, which covered the top,
that his house was as dry as if it had been entiled or slated.
Indeed, he owned that the savages had made the basket-work
for him. The outer circuit was covered as a lean-to, all round
this inner apartment, and long rafters lay from the thirty-two
angles to the top posts of the inner house, being about twenty
feet distant; so that there was a space like a walk within
the outer wicker wall and without the inner, near twenty feet
wide.
The inner place be partitioned off with the same wicker-work,
but much fairer, and divided into six apartments, so that he had
304 ADVENTURES 0?
304 ADVENTURES 0?
door into the main tent, and another door into the space or
walk that was round it: so that walk was also divided into six
equal parts: which served not only for a retreat, but to store up
any necessan'es which the family had occasion for. These six
spaces not taking up the whole circumference, what other apart-
ments the outer circle had were thus ordered :—As soon as you
were in at the door of the outer circle, you had a short passage
straight before you to the door of the inner house: but on either
side was a wicker partition, and a door in it, by which you went
304 ADVENTURES 0?
thirty feet long, and through that into another, not quite so long :
so that in the outer circle were ten handsome rooms, six of which
were only to be come at through the apartments of the inner
tent, and served as closets or retiring rooms to the respective
chambers of the inner circle ; and four large warehouses, or barns,
or what you please to call them, which went through one another,
two on either hand of the passage, that led through the outer
door to the inner tent.
Such a piece of basket-work, I believe, was never seen in the
world, nor a house or tent so neatly contrived, much less so built.
In this great bee-hive lived the three families, that is to say, Will
Atkins and his companion; the third was killed, but his wife re-
mained, with three children, for she was, it seems, big with child
when he died: and the other two were not at all backward to
give the widow her full share of every thing, I mean as to their
corn, milk, grapes, &c., and when they killed a kid, or found a
turtle on the shore; so that tl ey all lived well enough; th )ugh
it was true, they were not so industrious as the other two, as
has been observed already.
One thing, however, cannot be omitted, viz. that, as for religion,
I do not know that there was anything of that kind among them:
they often, indeed, put one another in mind that there was a God,
by the very common method of seamen, viz. swearing by his
name: nor were their poor ignorant savage wives much better
for having been married to Christians, as we must call them : for
as they knew very little of God themselves, so they were utterly
incapable of entering into any discourse with their wives about
a God, or to talk anything to them concerning religion.
The utmost of all the improvement which I can say the Wives
had made from them was, that they had taught them to speak
English pretty well; and most of their children, which were near

over; but they had all been pretty fruitful, for they had all children,
more or less; I think the cook’s mate’s wife was big of her sixth
child: and the mothers were all a good sort of well-governed,
quiet, laborious women, modest and decent, helpful to one
another, mighty observant and subject to their masters (I cannot
call them husbands), and wanted nothing but to be well instructed
in the Christian religion, and to be legally married; both which
were happily brought about afterwards by my means. or. at
least, in consequence of my coming among them.

llAVlNG thus given an account of the colony in general, and
pretty much of my runagate English, I must say something of the
Spaniards, who were the main body of the family, and in whose
story there are some incidents also remarkable enough.
I had a great many discourses with them about their circum-
stances when they were among the savages. They told me readily
that they had no instances to give of their application or in enuity
in that country; that they were a poor, miserable, deject hand-
ful of people; that if means had been put into their hands, yet
they had so abandoned themselves to despair, and so sunk under
the weight of their misfortunes, that they thought of nothing but
starving. One of them, a grave and sensible man, told me he
was convinced they were in the wrong; that it was not the part
of wise men to give themselves up to their misery, but always to

had made in my solitude; my unwearied application, as he called
it; and how I had made a condition which in its circumstances

they were cast upon the shore without necessaries, without
supply of food, or present sustenance till they could provide it;
that, it was true, I had this disadvantage and discomfort, that
I was alone; but then the supplies I had providentially thrown
into my hands, by the unexpected driving of the ship on shore,
was such a help as would have encouraged any creature in the
world to have applied himself as I had done. Seuhor, says the
Spaniard, had we poor Spaniards been in your case, we should
never have got half those things out of the ship, as you did:
nay, says he, we should never have found means to have got a
raft to carry them, or to have got the raft on shore without
boat or sail; and how much less should we have done if any
of us had been alone! Well, I desired him to abate his com-
pliment, and go on with the history of their coming on shore,
where they landed. He told me they unhappily landed at a
place where there were people without provisions; whereas,
ad they had the common sense to have put off to sea again,
and gone to another island a little farther, they had found pro-
visions, though without people; there being an island that way,
as they had been told, where there were provisions, though no
people; that is to say, that the Spaniards of Trinidad had fre-

and herbs, which they understood not and which had no sub

of their country.
They gave me an account how many ways they strove to
civilize the savages they were with, and to teach them rational
customs in the ordinary way of living, but in vain; and how
they retorted it upon them, as unjust, that they, who came there
for assistance and support, should attempt to set up for in-
structors of those that gave them food; intimating, it seems,
that none should set up for the instructors of others but those
who could live without them.
They gave me dismal accounts of the extremities they were
driven to; how sometimes they were many days without any
food at all, the island they were upon being inhabited by a sort
of savages that lived more indolent, and for that reason were
less supplied with the necessaries of life, than they had reason
to believe others were in the same part of the world; and yet
they found that these savages were less ravenous and voracious
than those who had better supplies of food. Also they added,
they could not but see with what demonstrations of wisdom and
goodness the governing providence of God directs the events of
things in the world; which, they said, appeared in their circum-
stances; for if, pressed by the hardships they were under, and
the barrenness of the country where they were, they had searched
after a better to live in, they had then been out of the way of
the relief that happened to them by my means.
They then gave me an account how the savages whom they
lived among expected them to go out with them into their wars;

been serviceable not only to their friends, but have made them-

condition than the savages themselves; for they had neither
bows nor arrows, nor could they use those the savages gave
them: so they could do nothing but stand still, and be wounded
with arrows, till they came up to the teeth of their enemy;
and then, indeed, the three halberds they had were of use to
them; and they would often drive a whole little army before
them with those halberds, and sharpened sticks put into the
muzzles of their muskets: but that, for all this, they were
sometimes surrounded with multitudes, and in great danger
from their arrows, till at last they found the way to make
themselves large targets of wood, which they covered with
skins of wild beasts, whose names they knew not, and these
covered them from the arrows of the savages: yet, notwith-

with joy at the return of their friend and companion in misery,
who, they thought, had been devoured by wild beasts of the
worst kind, viz. by wild men; and yet how more and more they
were surprised with the account he gave them of his errand, and
that there was a Christian in any place near, much more one that
was able, and had humanity enough, to contribute to their
deliverance.
They described how they were astonished at the sight of the
relief I sent them, and at the appearance of loaves of bread, things
they had not seen since their coming to that miserable place; how
often they crossed it and blessed it as bread sent from Heaven;
and what a reviving cordial it was to their spirits to taste it, as
also the other things I had sent for their supply; and, after all,
they would have told me something of the joy they were in at the
sight of a boat and pilots, to carry them away to the person and
place from whence all these new comforts came, but it was im-
possible to express it by words, for their excessive joy naturally
driving them to unbecoming extravagances, they had no way to
describe them, but by telling me they bordered upon lunacy,
having no way to give vent to their passions suitable to the sense
that was upon them; that in some it worked one way, and in
some another; and that some of them, through a surprise of joy,
would burst into tears, others be stark mad, and others imme-
diately faint. This discourse extremely affected me, and called
to my mind Friday's ecstasy when he met his father, and the
poor people’s ecstasy when I took them up at sea after their
nosmscn causes. 309
himself delivered in the place where he expected to perish; and
my own joy, when, after twenty-eight years’ captivity, I found
a good ship ready to carry me to my own country. All these
things made me more sensible of the relation of these poor men,
and more affected with it.
Having thus given a view of the state of things as I found
them, I must relate the heads of what 1 did for these people,
and the condition in which I left them. It was their opinion,
and mine too, that they would be troubled no more with the
savages, or, if they were, they would be able to cut them off, if
they were twice as many as before; so they had no concern
about that. Then I entered into a serious discourse with the
Spaniard, whom I call governor, about their stay in the island;
for as l was not come to carry any of them off, so it would not
be just to carry off some and leave others, who, perhaps, would
be unwilling to stay if their strength was diminished. On the
other hand, I told them I came to establish them there, not to
remove them: and then I let them know that I had brought
with me relief of sundry kinds for them; that I had been at a
great charge to supply them with all things necessary, as well
for their convenience as their defence; and that I had such and
such particular persons with me, as well to increase and recruit
their number, as by the particular necessary employments which

in which at present they were in want.
They were all together when I talked thus to them; and before
I delivered to them the stores I had brought, I asked them, one
810 anvanruaas or
that had been among them, and would shake hands with one
another, and engage in a strict friendship and union of interest,
that so there might be no more misunderstandings and jealousies.

his part, he would live and die with them; and was so far
from designing anything against the Spaniards, that he owned
they had done nothing to im but what his own mad humour
made necessary, and what he would have done, and perhaps
worse, in their case; and that he would ask them pardon, if I
desired it, for the foolish and brutish things he had done to
them, and was very willing and desirous of living in terms of
entire friendship and union with them, and would do anything
that lay in his power to convince them of it: and as for going
to England, he cared not if he did not go thither these twenty
ears.

for the necessity they were under to do so; but that Will

merit to be valued and trusted; and they most heartily embraced
the occasion of giving me this assurance, that they would never
have any interest separate from one another.
Upon these frank and open declarations of friendship, we
appointed the next day to dine all together; and, indeed, we
made a splendid feast. I caused the ship's cook and his mate
to come on shore and dress our dinner, and the old cook’s
mate we had on shore assisted. We brought on shore six pieces
of good beef, and four pieces of pork, out of the ship’s provision,

English beer: things that neither the Spaniards nor the English

sent, covered up close, on board the ship to the seamen,
that they might feast on fresh meat from on shore, as we did
with their salt meat from on board.
After this feast, at which we were very innocently merry, 1
brought out my cargo of goods: wherein that there might be no

quantity of the goods that were for wearing: that is to say,

I cannot express what pleasure, what satisfaction, sat upon
the countenances of all these poor men, when they saw the care
I had taken of them, and how well I had furnished them. They
told me I was a father to them; and that having such a corre-
spondent as I was in so remote a part of the world, it would
make them forget that they were left in a desolate place; and
they all voluntarily engaged to me not to leave the place with-
out my consent.
Then I presented tc them the people I had brought with
me, particularly the tailor, the smith, and the two carpenters,
all of them most necessary peo le; but, above all, my general

them, went to work immediately, and, with my leave, made

Still more, he taught the women not only how to sew and stitch,
and use the needle, but made them assist to make the shirts for
their husbands, and for all the rest.
As to the carpenters, I scarce need mention how useful they
were; for they took to pieces all my clums , unhandy things,
and made them clever convenient tables, stoo s, bedsteads, cup-
boards, lockers, shelves, and everything they wanted of that
312 ADVENTURES or
I carried the carpenter to see Will Atkins’s basket-house, as
I called it: and they both owned they never saw an instance of
such natural ingenuity before, nor anything so regular and so
handily built, at least of its kind: and one of them, when he
saw it, after musing a good while, turning about to me, I am
sure, says he, that man has no need of us; you need do nothing
but give him tools.
Then I broughtthem out all my store of tools, and gave every
man a digging-spade, a shovel, and a. rake, for we had no
harrows or ploughs; and to every separate place a pick-axe, a.
crow, a broad axe, and a saw; always appointing, that as often
as any were broken or worn out, they should be supplied, With-
out grudging, out of the general stores that I left behind. Nails,
staples, hinges, hammers, chisels,- knives, scissors, and all sorts
of iron-work, they had without tale, as they required: for no
man would take more than he wanted, and he must be a fool
that would waste or spoil them on any account whatever; and,
for the use of the smith, I left two tons of unwrought iron for a.

I carried on shore with me the young man whose mother
was starved to death, and the maid also: she was a sober, well

voyage; I say, considering all this, both of them came to me,
and desired I would give them leave to remain on the island, and
he entered among my family, as they called it. I agreed to this
readily; and they had a little plot of ground allotted to them,
where they had three tents or houses set up, surrounded with a
basket-work, pallisadoed like Atkins’s, adjoining to his planta-
tion. Their tents were contrived so that they had each of them
a room apart to lodge in, and a middle tent, like a great store-
house, to lay their goods in, and to eat and drink in. And now
the other two Englishmen removed their habitation to the same
place; and so the island was divided into three colonies, and no

at my old habitation under the hill, which was, in a word, the
capital city; and where they had so enlarged and extended their
works, as well under as on the outside of the hill, that they lived,
though perfectly concealed, yet full at large. Never was there
such a little city in a wood, and so hid, in any part of the world ;
for I verily believe a thousand men might have ranged the island
a month, and, if they had not known there was such a thing, and
looked on purpose for it, they would not have found it; for the
trees stood so thick and so close, and grew so fast-woven one

cover the place, except the only two narrow entrances where
they went in and out could be found, which was not very easy:
one of them was close down at the water's edge, on the side of
the creek, and it was afterwards above two hundred yards to the
place; and the other was up a ladder at twice, as I have already
formerly described it; and they had also a large wood thick-
planted on the top of the hill, containing above an acre, which
grew ap'ace, and concealed the place from all discovery there,
with only one narrow place between two trees, not easily to be
discovered, to enter on that side.
The other colony was that of Will Atkins, where there were
four families of Englishmen, I mean those I had left there, with
their wives and children; three savages that were slaves; the
widow and the children of the Englishman that was killed; the
oung man and the maid; and, by the way, we made a wife of
her before we went away. There was also the two carpenters
and the tailor, whom I brought with me for them; also the smith,
who was a very necessary man to them, especially as a gun-
smith, to take care of their arms; and my other man, whom I
called Jack-of-all-trades, who was in himself as good almost as
twenty men; for he was not only a very ingenious fellow, but
a very merry fellow; and before I went away we married him
to the honest maid that came with the youth in the ship I men-
tioned before.
And now I speak of marrying, it brings me naturally to saw
something of the F rencn ecclesiastic that I had brought whh me
out of the ship’s crew whom I took up at sea. It is true, this
man was a Roman, and perhaps it may give offence to some
hereafter, if I leave anything extraordinary upon record of a man

of me to give him a due character; and I must say, he was a.
grave, sober, pious, and most religious person; exact in his life,
extensive in his charity, and exemplary in almost every thing
he did. What then can any one say against being very sensible
of the value of such a man, notwithstanding his profession?
though it may be my opinion, perhaps, as well as the opinion or
others who shall read this, that he was mistaken.

about religion in the most obliging manner imaginable. Sir,
says he, you have not only under God (and at that he crossed
his breast) saved my life, but you have admitted me to go this
voyage in your ship, and by your obliging civility have taken
me into your family, giving me an opportunity of free conver-
sation. Now, sir, you see by my habit what my profession is,
and I guess by your nation what yours is; I may think it is my
duty, and don tless it is so, to use my utmost endeavours, on all
occasions, to bring all the souls I can to the knowledge of the
truth, and to embrace the catholic doctrine; but as I am here
under your permission, and in your family, I am bound, in jus-
tice to your kindness, as well as in decency and good manners,
to be under your government; and therefore I shall not, without
your leave, enter into any debate on the oints of religion in
which we may not agree, farther than you s all give me leave.

acknowledge it; that it was true, we were such people as they

if we did not converse without anv dislike on either side, it should
be his fault, not ours.
He replied, that he thought all our conversation might be
easily separated from disputes; that it was not his business to
cap principles with every man he conversed with; and that be
rather desired me to converse with him as a gentleman than as
a religionist; and that, if I would give him leave at any time to
discourse upon religious subjects, he would readily comply with
it, and that he did not doubt but I would allow him also to de-
fend his own opinions as well as he could; but that, without my
leave, he would not break in upon me with any such thing. lie
told me farther, that he would not cease to do all that became

her; and though, perhaps, we would not jom with him, and he
could not pray with us, he hoped he might pray for us, which
he would do upon all occasions. In this manner we conversed;
and, as he was of the most obliging, gentleman-like behaviour
so he was, if I may be allowed to say so, a man of good sense,
and, as Ibelieve, of great learning. _
He gave me a most diverting account of his life, and of the
many extraordinary events of it; of many adventures which had
befallen him in the few years that he had been abroad in the
world; and particularly this was verywemarkable, viz. that in
the voyage he was now engaged in, he had the misfortune to be

SECTION X XXVI".
ROBlNSON‘S DISCOURSE WITH THE ECCLESIASTIC AS TO INTRO-
DUCING MARRIAGE AMONG THE PEOPLE.——MARRIAGES PER-
FORMED.-——ATKINS CONVERTS HIS WIFE.
“E came to me one morning, for he lodged among us all the
while we were upon the island, and it happened to be just when
I was going to visit the Englishmen’s colony, at the farthest part
of the island; I say, he came to me, and told me *with a very
grave countenance, that he had for two or three days desired
an opportunity of some discourse with me, which he hoped
would not be displeasing to me, because he thought it might in
some measure correspond with my general design, which was,
the prosperity of my new colony, and perhaps might put it, at
least more than he thought it was, in the way of God’s blessing.
I looked a little surprised at the last part of his discourse,
and turning a little short, How, sir, said I, can it be said that
we are not in the way of God‘s blessing, after such visible assist-
ances and wonderful deliverances as we have seen here, and of
which I have given you a large account ’.'—If you had pleased,
sir, said he, with a world of modesty, and yet with great readi-
ness, to have heard me, you would have found no room to be
displeased, much less to think so hard of me, that I should suggest
that you have not had wonderful assistances and deliverances;
and I hope, on your behalf, that you are in the way of God's
blessing, as your design is exceeding good, and will prosper:
but, sir. though it were more so than is even possible to you,
yet there may be some among you that are not equally right in

their actions; and you know, that in the story of the children
of Israel, one Achan in the camp removed God’s blessing from
them, and turned his hand so against them, that six and thirty
of them, though not concerned in the crime, were the objects
of divine vengeance, and bore the weight of that punishment.
I was sensibly touched with his discourse, and told him his
inference was so just, and the whole design seemed so sincere,
and was really so religious in-its own nature, that I was very
sorry I had interrupted him, and begged him to go on: and
in the mean time, because it seemed that what we had both to
say might take up some time, I told him Iwas- going to the
Englishmen’s plantations, and asked him to go with'ine, and we
might discourse of it 'by the way. He told me' he would the
more willingly wait on me thither, because there partly the
thing was acted which he desired to speak to me about; so we
walked on, and I pressed him to be free and plain with me in
what he had to say.
Why then, sir, says he, be pleased to give me leave to lay
down a few propositions, as the foundation of what I have to
say, that we may not differ in the general principles, though we
may be of some differing opinions in the practice of particulars.
First, sir, though we differ in some of the doctrinal articles of
religion, and it is very unhappy it is so, especially in the case
before us, as I shall show afterwards, yet there are some general
principles in-which we both agree, viz. that there is a God; and
that this God having given us some stated general rules for our
service and obedience, we ought not willingly and knowingly to
I offend him, either by neglecting to do what he has commanded,
or by doing what he has expressly forbidden ; and let our differ-
ent religions be what they will, this general principle is readily
owned by us all, that the blessing of God does not ordinarily
follow presumptuous sinning against his command; and every
good Christian will be affectionately concerned to prevent any
that are under his care living in a total neglect of God and his
commands. It is not your men being Protestants, whatever
my opinion may be of such, that discharges me from being
concerned for their souls, and from endeavouring, if it lies before
me, that they should live in as little distance from enmity with
their Maker as possible, especially if you give me leave to med-
die so far in your circuit. ‘
1 could not yet imagine what he aimed at, and told him I
granted all he had said, and thanked him that he would so far
concern himself for us; and begged he would explain the parti-
culars of what he had observed, that, like Joshua, to take his own
parable, I might put away the accursed thing from us. .
Why then, sir, says he, I will take the liberty you give me;
and there are three things, which. if I am right, must stand in
the way of God‘s blessing upon your endeavours here, and
Y 2
which I should rejoice, for your sake, and their own, to see
removed: and, sir, I promise myself that you will fully agree
with me in them all, as soon as I name them ; especially because
I shall convince you that every one of them may, with great
ease, and very much to your satisfaction, be remedied. First,
sir, says he, you have here four Englishmen, who have fetched
women from among the savages, and have taken them as their
wives, and have had many children by them all, and yet are not
married to them after any stated, legal manner, as the laws of
God and man require ; and therefore are yet, in the sense of both,
no less than fornicators, if not living in adultery. To this, sir,
I know you will object that there was no clergyman or priest
of any kind, or of any profession, to perform the ceremony; nor
any pen and ink, or paper, to write down a contract of marriage,
and have it signed between them: and I know also, sir, what
the Spaniard governor has told you, I mean, of the agreement
that he obliged them to make when they took those women,
viz. that they should choose them out by consent, and keep
separately to them, which, by the way, is nothing of a. marriage,
no agreement with the women, as wives, but only an agreement
among themselves, to keep them from quarrelling. But, sir, the
essence of the sacrament of matrimony (so he called it, being a
Roman) consists not only in the mutual consent of the parties
to take one another as man and wife, but in the formal and legal
obligation that there is in the contract, to compel the man and
woman, at all times, to own and acknowledge each other;
obliging the man to abstain from all other women, to engage in
no other contract while these subsist, and, on all occasions, as
ability allows, to provide honestly for them and their children;
and to oblige the women to the same, or like conditions, mutatis
mutandis, on their side. Now, sir, says he, these men may when
"they please or when occasion presents, abandon these women,
disown their children, leave them to perish, and take other
women, and marry them while these are living: and here he
added, with some warmth, How, sir, is God honoured in this
unlawful liberty? and how shall a blessing succeed your endea-
vours in this place, however good in themselves, and however
sincere in your design, while these men, who at present are your
subjects, under your absolute government and dominion, are
allowed by you to live in open adultery?
I confess I was struck with the thing itself, but much more
with the convincing arguments he supported it with; for it was
certainly true, that though they had no clergyman upon the
spot, yet a formal contract on both sides, made before witnesses,

bound by, though it had been but breaking a stick between
them, engaging the men to own these women for their wives
upon all occasions, and never to abandon them or their children,

and the women to the same with their husbands, had oeen an
effectual lawful marriage in the sight of God; and it was a great

was not here; and they had lived so many years with them now,
that if it was adultery, it was past remedy; they could do no-
thing in it now.
Sir, says be, asking your pardon for such freedom, you are
right in this, that, it being done in your absence, you could not
be charged with that part of the crime; but, I beseech you,

to do your utmost now to put an end to it. How can you think
but that, let the time past lie on whom it will, all the guilt, for the
future, will lie entirely upon you? because it is certainly in your
power now to put an end to it, and in nobody’s power but yours.
I was so dull still, that I did not take him right; but I
imagined that, by putting an end to it, he meant that I should
part them, and not suffer them to live together any longer; and
I said to him I could not do that, by any means, for that it
would put the whole island into confusion. He seemed surprised
that I should so far mistake him. No, sir, says he, I do not

may not be easy to reconcile them to, though it will be effectual,
even by your own laws, so your way may be as well before
God, and as valid among men; I mean, by a written contract
signed by both man and Woman, and by all the witnesses pre—
sent, which all the laws of Europe would decree to be valid.
I was amazed to see so much true piety, and so much sincerity
of zeal, besides the unusual impartialityin his discourse as to his
own party or church, and such true warmth for preserving the
\people that he had no knowledge of or relation to; I say, for
preserving them from transgressing the laws of God, the like
of which I had indeed not met with any where: but, recollecting
what he had said of marrying them by a written contract, which
I knew he would stand to, I returned it back upon him, and
told him, I granted all that he had said to be just, and on his
part very kind; that I would discourse with the men upon the
point now, when I came to them; and I knew no reason why
they should scruple to let him marry them all, which I knew
well enough would be granted to be as authentic and valid in
England as if they were married by one of our own clergymen.
What was afterwards done in this matter I shall speak of by itself.
I then pressed him to tell me what was the second complaint
which he had to make, acknowledging that I was very much his
ROBINSON causo}: 819
me he would use the same freedom and plainness in the second,
and hoped I would take it as well; and this was, that notwith
standing these English subjects of mine, as he called them, had
lived with those ,women for almost seven years, had taught
them to speak English, and even to read it, and that they were,
as he perceived, women of tolerable understanding, and capable
of instruction, yet they had not, to this hour, taught them any-
thing of the Christian religion, no, not so much as to know that
there was a God, or a worship, or in what manner God was to
be served; or that their own idolatry, and worshipping they
knew not whom, was false and absurd. This, he said, was an
unaccountable neglect, and what God would certainly call them
to account for, and perhaps, at last, take the work out of" their
hands—he spoke th's very affectionately, and warmly. I am
persuaded, says he, had those men lived in the savage country
whence their wives came, the savages would have taken more
pains to have brought them to be idolaters, and to worship the
devil, than any of these men, so far as I can see, have taken with
them to teach them the knowledge of the true God. Now, sir,
said he, though I do not acknowledge your religion, or you mine,
yet we would be glad to see the devil’s servants, and the subjects
of his kingdom, taught to know the general principles of the
Christian religion : that they might, at least, hear of God, and a
Redeemer, and of the resurrection, and of a future state,—things
which we all believe; they would have, at least, been so much
nearer comiuginto the bosom of the true church than they are
now, in the public profession of idolatry and devil-worship.
I could hold no longer; I took him in my arms, and embraced
him With an excess of passion. How far, said I to him, have
I been from understanding the most essential part of a Christian !
viz. to love the interest of the Christian church, and the good
of other men's souls: I scarce have known what belongs to the
being a Christian.—O, sir, do not say so, replied be; this thing
is not your fault—No, saidI; but why did I never lay it to
heart as well as you ?—It is not too late yet, said he; be not too
forward to condemn yourself.—-But what can be done now? said
I; you see I am going away—Will you give me leave to talk
with these poor men about it ?—Yes, with all my heart, said I ;
and will oblige them to give heed to what you say too.—As to
that, said he, we must leave them to the mercy of Christ; but it
is your business to assist them, encourage them, and instruct
them; and if you give me leave, and God his blessing, I do not
doubt but the poor ignorant souls shall be brought home to the
great circle of Christianity, if not into the particular faith we all
embrace, and that even while you stay here. Upon this I said,
I shall not onlv give you leave, but give you a thousand thanks
for it. What Followed on this account I shall mention also again
in its place.
‘I now Dressed him for the third article in which we were to
binne- Why, really, says he, it is of the same nature; and I
will proceed, asking your leave, with the same plainness as
before; it is about your poor savages, who are, as I may sa ,
your conquered subjects. It is a maxim, sir, that is, or oug t
to be, received among all Christians,>of what church or pre-
tended church soever, viz., The Christian knowledge ought to
be propagated by all possible means, and on all possible occa~
sions. It is on this principle that our church sends missionaries
into Persia, India, China; and that our clergy, even of the supe-
rior sort, willingly engage in the most hazardous voyages, and
the most dangerous residence among murderers and barbarians,
to teach them the knowledge of the true God, and to bring them
over to embrace the Christian faith. Now, sir, you have such
an opportunity here to have six or seven and thirty poor
savages brought over from idolatry to the knowledge of God,
their Maker and Redeemer, that I wonder how you can pass
such an occasion of doing good, which is really worth the ex-
pense of a man’s whole life.
I was now struck dumb, indeed, and had not one word to say.
I had here a spirit of true Christian zeal for God and religion
before me, let his particular principles be of what kind soever:
as for me, I had not so much as entertained a thought of this in
my heart before, and I believe I should not have thought of it;
for I looked upon these savages as slaves, and people whom,
had we any work for them to do, we would have used as such,
or would have been glad to have transported them to any other
part of the world: for our business was to get rid of them; and

He looked earnestly at me, seeing me in some disorder—l

been so wonderfully delivered. He owned the case was very
hard upon me, as to my voyage , but laid it home upon my cou-
science, whether the blessing of saving thirty-seven souls was
not worth venturing all I had in the world for. I was not so
sensible of that as he was. I returned upon him thus: Wh ,
sir, it is a valuable thing, indeed, to be an instrument in G '3
hand to convert thirty-seven heathens to the knowledge of
Christ; but as you are an ecclesiastic, and are given over to the
work, so that it seems so naturally to fall into the way of your
profession, how is it then that you do not rather offer yourself
to undertake it, than press me to do it?
Upon this he faced about just before me, as he walked along,
and putting me to a full stop, made me avery low how. I most
heartily thank God and you, sir, said be, for giving me so evi-
dent a call to so messed a work; and if you think yourself dis-
charged from it, and desire me to undertake it, [will most
readily do it, and think it a ha py reward for all the hazards and

work. I aused a considerable while before I could tell what
322 ADVENTURES or
sincerity and zeal, and carried out in his zeal beyond the ordi-
nary rate of men, not of his profession only, but even of any
profession whatsoever. But after I had considered it awhile,
I asked him seriously if he was in earnest, and that he would
venture, on the single consideration of an attempt on those poor
people, to be locked up in an unplanted island for perhaps his
life, and at last might not know whether he should be able to do
them good or not?
He turned short upon me, and asked me what I called a
venture? Pray, sir, said be, what do you think I consented to
go in your ship to the East Indies for ?—-Nay, said I, that I
know not, unless it was to reach to the Indians.—D0ubtless
it was, said he; and do you t ink, if I can convert these thirty-
scven men to the faith of Jesus Christ, it is not worth my time,
though I should never be fetched off the island again? Nay,
322 ADVENTURES or
my life is, or the life of twenty more of the same profession?
Yes, sir, says he, I would give Christ and the blessed Virgin
thanks 'all my days, if I could be made the least happy instru-
ment of saving the souls of those poor men, though I were
never to set my foot off this island, or see my native country
any more. But since you will honour me with putting me
into this work, for which Iwill pray for you all the days 0!
my life, I have one humble petition to you besides.—What is
that? said I. Why, says he, it is, that you will leave your
man Friday with me, to be my interpreter to them, and to
assist me; for without some help I cannot speak to them, or
they to me.
Iwas sensibly touched at his requesting Friday, becauseI
could not think of parting with him, and that for many reasons:
he had been the companion of my travels; he was not only
faithful to me, but sincerely affectionate to the last degree;
and I had resolved to do something considerable for him if he
outlived me, as it was probable he would. Then I knew that
as I had bred Friday up to be a Protestant, it would quite
confound him to bring him to embrace another profession; and
he would never, while his eyes were open, believe that his old
master was a heretic, and would be damned; and this might,
in the end, ruin the poor fellow’s principles, and so turn him
nonmsox causoa. 323
relieved me in this strait, and it was this: Itold him I could
not say that I was willing to part with Friday on any account
whatever, though a work that to him was of more value' than
his life, ought to be to me of much more value than the keeping
or parting with a servan‘. But, on the other hand, I was per-
suaded that Friday would by no means agree to part with me:
and I could not force him to it without his consent, without
manifest injustice; because I had promised I would never put
him away, and he had promised and engaged to me that he
would never leave me unless I put him away.
He seemed very much concerned at it, for he had no rational
access to these poor people, seeing he did not understand one
word of their language, nor they one word of his. To remove
this difficulty, I told him Friday’s father had learned Spanish,
which I found he also understood, and he should serve him as an

nonmsox causoa. 323
we came to the Englishmen, I sent for them altogether, and
after some account given them of what I had done for them, viz.
what necessary things I had provided for them, and how they
were distributed, which they were very sensible of, and very
thankful for, I began to talk to them of the scandalous life they
led, and gave them a full account of the notice the clergyman
had taken of it; and arguing how unchristian and irreligious a

bachelors? They soon explained their conditions to me, and
‘ showed that two of them were widowers, and the other three
were single men, or bachelors. I asked them with what con-
science they could take those women, and lie with them as they
had done, call them their wives, and have so many children by
them, and not be lawfully married to them T
They all gave me the answer I expected, viz. that there was
nobody to marry them; that they agreed before the governor
to keep them as their wives, and to maintain them and own
them as their wives; and they thought, as things stood with
them, they were as legally married as if they had been married
by a person, and with all the formalities in the world.
I told them that no doubt they were married in the sight of
God, and were bound in conscience to keep them as their wives;
but that the laws of men being otherwise, they might desert the
poor women and children hereafter; and that their wives being
poor desolate women, friendless and moneyless, would have no
way to help themselves. I therefore told them that, unless [was
assured of their honest intent, I could do nothing for them, but
would take care that what I did should be for the women and
children without them; and that, unless they would give me some
assurances that they would marry the women, I could not think
it was convenient they should continue together as man and wife;
for it was both scandalous to men and offensive to God, who
they could not think would bless them if they went on thus.
All this went on as I expected; and they told me, especially
Will Atkins, who now seemed to speak for the rest, that they
loved their wives as well as if they had been born in their own
native country, and would not leave them upon any account
whatever: and they did verily believe their wives were as vir-
tuous and as modest, and did, to the utmost of their skill, as
much for them and for their children, as any women could pos-
sibly do; and they would not part with them on any account :
and Will Atkins, for his own particular, added, that if any man

and make him captain of the best man—of-war in the navy, he
would not go with him, if he might not carry his wife and chil-
dren with him; and if there was a clergyman in the ship, he
would be married to her now with all his heart.
This was just as I would have it: the priest was not With
me at that moment, but was not far off; so, to try him farther,
I told him I had a clergyman with me, and, if he was sincere,
I would have him married next morning, and bade him con-
sider of it, and talk with the rest. He said, as for himself, he
need not consider of it at all, for he was ver ready to do it, and
was glad I had a minister with me, and he elieved they would
be all willing also. I then told him that my friend, the mi-
nister, was a Frenchman, and could not speak English, but I
would act the clerk between them. He never so much as
asked me whether he was a Papist or Protestant, which was '
Indeed what I was afraid of; so we parted : I went back to
my clergyman, and W111 Atkins went in to talk with his
companion. I desired the French gentleman not to say any
thing to them till the business was thorough ripe: and I told
him what answer the men had given me.
Before I went from their uarter, they all came to me, and
told me they had been consi ering what I had said; that they
were glad to hear I had a clergyman in my company, and they
were very willing to give me the satisfaction I esired, and to
be formally married as soon as I pleased; for they were far
from desiring to part with their wives, and that they meant
nothing but what was very honest when they chose them. So
I appointed them to meet me the next morning, and, in the
mean time, they should let their wives know the meaning of
the marriage law; and that it was not only to prevent any
scandal, but also to oblige them that they should not forsake
them, whatever might happen.

reason to be: so they failed not to attend altogether at my
apartment next morning, where I brought out my clergyman,
and though he had not on a minister’s gown, after the manner of
England, or the habit of a priest, after the manner of France, yet
having a black vest, something like a cassock, with a sash round
it, he did not look very unlike a minister; and as for his language,
I was his interpreter. But the seriousness of his behaviour to
them, and the scruples he made of marrying the women because
they were not baptized and professed Christians, gave them an
exceeding reverence for his person : and there was no need, after
that, to inquire whether he was a clergyman or not. Indeed, I
was afraid his scruples would have been carried so far, as that
he would not have married them at all; nay, notwithstanding all
1 was able to say to him, he resisted me, though modestly, yet
very steadily: and at last refused absolutely to marry them,

me that is a professed7 Christian to a savage, an idolater an
a heathen, one that is not baptized; and yet that he did not
see that there was time left to endeavour to persuade the
women to be baptized, or to profess the name of Christ, whom
they had, he doubted, heard nothing of, and without which
they could not be baptized. He told them he doubted they
were but indifferent Christians themselves; that they had but
little knowledge of God or of his ways, and therefore he could
not expect that they had said much to their wives on that head
yet; but that, unless they would promise him to use their
endeavours with their wives to persuade them to become Chris-
tians, and would, as well as they could, instruct them in the
knowledge and belief of God that made them, and to worship
Jesus Christ that redeemed them, he could not marry them;
for he would have no hand in joining Christians with savages ;
nor was it consistent with the principles of the Christian religion,
and was indeed expressly forbidden in God's law.
They heard all this very attentively, and I delivered it very
faithfully to them from his mouth, as near his own words as I
could; only sometimes adding something of my own, to con-
vince them how just it was, and how I was of his mind: and I
always very faithfully distinguished between what I said from
myself, and what were the clergyman's words. They told me
it was very true what the gentleman said, that they were very
indifferent Christians themselves, and that they had never talked
to their wives about religion. Lord, sir, says Will Atkins, how
should we teach them religion? why, we know nothing our-
selves; and besides, sir, said he, should we talk to them of God
and Jesus Christ, and heaven and hell, it would make them laugh
at us, and ask us what we believe ourselves. And if we should
tell them that we believe all the things we speak of to them,
such as of good people going to heaven, and wicked people to
the devil, they would ask us where we intend to go ourselves,
that believe all this, and are such wicked fellows as we indeed
are. Why, sir, 'tis enough to give them a surfeit of religion at
326 ADVENTURES OF
they pretend to teach other people—Will Atkins, said I to him,
though I am afraid that what you say has too much truth in it,
yet can you not tell your wife she is in the wrong; that there is
a God, and a religion better than her own; that her gods are
idols; that they can neither hear nor speak; that there is a
great Being that made all things, and that can destroy all that
he has made; that he rewards the good and punishes the bad;
and that we are to be judged by him at last for all we do here?
You are not so ignorant, but even nature itself will teach you

true, and believe it yourself—That is true, sir, said Atkins ; but
with what face can I say anything to my wife of all this, when
lhe will tell me immediately it cannot be true Z—Not true! said
I ; what do you mean by that 'l— Why, sir, said he, she will teli

trary to what I must tell her is good, and to what I ought to
haVe done.—Wh_v, truly, Atkins, said I, I am afraid thou speak-
est too much truth; and with that I informed the clergyman of
what Atkins had said, for he was impatient to know. 0, said

and long-suffering forbears to punish those that offend; waiting
to be gracious, and willing not the death of a sinner, but rather
that he should return and live: that oftentimes he suffers wicked
men to go a long time, and even reserves damnation to the
general day of retribution: that it is a clear evidence of God
and of a future state, that righteous men receive not their reward,
or wicked men their punishment, till they come into another
world; and this will lead him to teach his wife the doctrine of the
resurrection and of the last judgment. Let him but repentfor him-
self, he will be an excellent preacher of repentance to his wife.

while, and who, we could easily perceive, was more than ordi-

me to make an end—I know all this, master, says he, and a
great deal more; but I have not the im udence to talk thus to
my wife, when God and my conscience ow, and my wife will
be an undeniable evidence against me, that I have lived as if I
had never heard of a God or future state, or anything about it;
and to talk of my repenting, alas l (and with that he fetched a
deep sigh, and I could see that the tears stood in his eyes) ’tis
past all that with me.-—Past it, Atkins? said I ; what dost thou
mean by that ?--I know well enough what I mean, says he; I
mean ’tis too late, and that is too true.
I told the clergyman, word for word, what he said: the poor
zealous priest,—I must call him so, for, be his opinion what it
will, he had certainly a most singular affection for the good of
other men’s souls, and it would be hard to think he had not the
like for his own,—I say, this affectionate man could not refrain
from tears; but, recovering himself, said to me, Ask him but one
question; Is be easy that it is too late; or is be troubled, and
wishes it were not so? I put the question fairly to Atkins; and
he answered, with a great deal of passion, How could any man be
easy in a condition that must certainly end in eternal destruc-
tion? that he was far from being easy; but that, on the contrary,
he believed it would, one time or other, ruin him. What do you
mean by that? said I. Why, he said, he believed he should one
time or other cut his throat, to put an end to the terror of it.
The clergyman shook his head with great concern in his face,
when I told him all this; but turning quick to me upon it, says,
If that be his case, we may assure him it is not too late; Christ
will give him repentance. But, pray, says he, explain this to
him; that as no man is saved but by Christ, and the merit
of his passion procuring divine mercy for him, how can it be
too late for any man to receive mercy? Does he think he is
able to sin beyond the power or reach of divine mercy? Pray
tell him, there may be a time when provoked mercy will no
longer strive, and when God may refuse to hear, but that it is
never too late for men to ask mercy; and we, that are Christ’s
servants, are commanded to preach mercy at all times, in the
name of Jesus Christ, to all those'that sincerely repent; so that
it is never too late to repent.
I told Atkins all this, and he heard me with great earnestness ;
828 ADVENTURES or
said to me, he would go and have some talk with his wife; so
he went out awhile, and we talked to the rest. I perceived they
were all stupidly ignorant as to matters of religion, as much as
I was when I went rambling away from my father; and yet
there were none of them backward to hear what had been said;
and all of them seriously promised that they would talk with
their wives about it, and do their endeavours to persuade them
to turn Christians.
The clergyman smiled upon me when I reported what answer
they gave, but said nothing a good while; but at last, shaking
his head, We that are Christ’s servants,-says he, can go no
farther than to exhort and instruct; and when men comply,
submit to the reproof, and promise what we ask, ’tis all we can
do; we are bound to accept their good words; but, believe me,
sir, said he, whatever you may have known of the life of that
man you call Will Atkins, I believe he is the only sincere con-
vert among them: I take that man to be a true penitent: I will
not despair of the rest; but that man is apparently struck with
the sense of his past life, and I doubt not, when he comes to
talk of religion to his wife, he will talk himself effectually into
it; for attempting to teach others is sometimes the best way of
teaching ourselves. I know a man, who, having nothing but a
summary notion of religion himself, and being wicked and

reformation in himself by labouring to convert a Jew. If that
poor Atkins begins but once to talk seriously of Jesus Christ
to his wife, my life for it, he talks himself into a thorough con- ‘
rert, makes himself a penitent; and who knows what may follow!
Upon this discourse, however, and their promising, as above,
to endeavour to persuade their wives to embrace Christianity,
he married the other two couple; but Will Atkins and his wife
were not yet come in. After this, my clergyman waiting awhile,
was curious to know where Atkins was gone; and turning to me,
said, I entreat you, sir, let us walk out of your labyrinth here,

other talking seriously to his wife, and teaching her already
something of religion. I began to be of the same mind; so we
went out together, and I carried him a way which none knew
but myself, and where the trees were so very thick that it was
not easy to see through the thicket of leaves, and far harder to
see in than to see out: when coming to the edge of the wood, I
saw Atkins and his tawny wife sittingunder the shade of a bush,
very eager in discourse: I stopped short till my clergyman came
up to me, and then having showed him where they were, we
stood and looked very steadily at them a good while. We ob-
served him very earnest with her, pointing up to the sun, and to
every quarter of the heavens, and then down to the earth, then
out to the sea, then to himself, then to her, to the woods, to the
trees. Now, says the clergyman, you see my words are made
gond, the man preaches to her; mark him now, he is telling her
that our God has made him and her, and the heavens, the earth,
the sea, the woods, the trees, &c.—I believe he is, said I. [m-
mediately we perceived Will Atkins start upon his feet, fall down
on his knees, and lift up both his hands. We supposed he said
something, but we could not hear him ; it was too far for that.
He did not continue kneeling half a minute, but comes and sits
down again by his wife, and talks to her again; we perceived
then the woman very attentive, but whether she said anything
to him, we could not tell. While the poor fellow was upon his
knees, I could see the tears run plentifully down my clergyman’s
cheeks, and I could hardly forbear myself; but it was a great

thing that passed between them. Well, however, we could come
no nearer, for fear of disturbing them; so we resolved to see an
end to this piece of still conversation, and it spoke loud enough
to us without the help of voice. He sat down again, as I have
said, close by her, and talked again earnestly to her, and two or
three times we could see him embrace her most passionately;
another time we saw him take out his handkerchief and wipe her
eyes, and then kiss her again, with a kind of transport very un-
usual; and after several of these things, we saw him on a sudden
jump up again, and lend her his hand to help her up, when im-
mediately leading her by the hand a step or two, they both
kneeled down together, and continued so about two minutes

we might see an end of the scene, which to me, I must confess,
was the most affecting that ever I saw in my life. Well, he strove
with himself for a while, but was in such raptures to think that
the poor heathen woman was become a Christian, that he was
not able to contain himself; he wept several times, then throw-
ing up his hands and crossing his breast, said over several things
ejaculatory, and by way of giving God thanks for so miraculous
a testimony of the success of our endeavours; some he spoke
softly, and I could not well hear others; some in Latin, some in
French; then two or three times the tears would interrupt him,
that he could not speak at all; but I begged that he would con-
tain himself, and let us more narrowly and fully observe what
was before us, which he did for a time, the scene not being near
ended yet; for after the poor man and his wife were risen again
from their knees, we observed he stood talking still eagerly to

with what he said, by her frequently lifting up her hands, laying
her hand to her breast, and such other postures as express
the greatest seriousness and attention : this continued about
half a quarter of an hour, and then they walked away; so we
could see no more of them in that situation. I took this interval

culars we had both been witnesses to, that, though 1 was hard
enough of belief in such cases, yet that I began to think it was
all very sincere here, both in the man and his wife, however ig-
norant they might both be. and I hoped such a beginning would
yet have a more happy end: And who knows, said I, but these
two may in time, by instruction and example, work upon some
of the others ’.'—Some of them? said be, turning quick upon me;
ay, upon all of them: depend upon it, if those two savages, for
he has been but little better, as you relate it, should embrace
Jesus Christ, they will never leave it till they work upon all the
rest; for true religion is naturally communicative, and he that is
once made a Christian will never leave a pagan behind him, if he
can help it. I owned it was a most christian principle to think
so, and a testimony of true zeal. as well as a generous heart, in
him. But, my friend, said I, will you give me leave to start one

that affectionate concern which you show for the turning the

count, out of the pale of the catholic church, without which you
believe there is no salvation? so that you esteem these but here-
tics, and for other reasons as effectually lost as the pagan:

To this he answered, with abundance of candour, thus: Sir,
I am a catholic of the Roman church, and a priest of the order
of St. Benedict, and I embrace all the principles of the Roman
faith; but yet, if you will believe me, and that I do not speak in
compliment to you, or in respect to my circumstances and your
civilities; I say, nevertheless, I do not look upon you who call
yourselves reformed, without some charity : I dare not say
(though I know it is our opinion in general) that you cannot be
saved; I will by no means limit the mercy of Christ so far as to
think that he cannot receive you into the bosom of his church,
in a manner to us unperceivahle; and I hope you have the same
charity for us: I pray daily for your being all restored to Christ's
church, by whatsoever method he, who is all-wise, is pleased to
direct. In the mean time, sure you will allow it consists with
me, as a Roman, to distinguish far between a protestant and a
pagan; between one that calls on Jesus Christ, though in a way
which I do not think is according to the true faith, and a savage
or a barbarian, that knows no God, no Christ, no Redeemer;

hope you are nearer being restored to it than those that know

ATKINS RELATES HIS CONVERSATION WITH HIS WIFE—THE LAT-
TER. BAPTIZED BY THE PRIEST.—-ACCOUNT OF THE STARVIN'G
STATE OF THOSE ON BOARD THE RESCUED VESSEL—ROBIN-
SON’S DEPARTURE FROM THE ISLAND.
I WAS astonished at the sincerity and temper of this pious papist,
as much as I was oppressed by the power of his reasoning; and
it presently occurred to my thoughts, that if such a temper was
universal, we might be all catholic Christians, whatever church
or particular profession we joined in; that a spirit of charity
would soon' work us all up into right principles; and as he
thought that the like charity would make us all catholics, so I
told him I believed had all the members of his church the like
moderation, they would soon all be protestants.—And there we
left that part; for we never disputed at all.
However, I talked to him another way, and taking him by the
hand, My friend, says I, I wish all the clergy of the Romish
church were blest with such moderation, and had an equal share
of your charity. 1 am entirely of your opinion : but I must tell
you, that if you should preach such doctrine in Spain or Italy,
they would put you into the Inquisition.—It may be so, said he;
I know not.what they would do in Spain or Italy; butI will not
say they would be the better' Christians for that severity; for I
am sure there is no heresy in abounding with charity.
As Will Atkins and his wife were gone, our business there
was over, so we went back our own way; and when we came
back, we found them waiting to be called in: observing this, I
asked my clergyman if we should discover to him that we had
seen him under the bush or not; and it was his 0 inion we
332 mmrmrs or
b would say to :s; so we called him in alone, nobody being
in the place but ourselves, and I began with him thus:
Will Atkins, said I, prithee what education had you? What
was your father?
W. A. A better man than ever I shall he: Sir, my father was
a clergyman.
R. C. What education did he give you?
W. A. He would have taught me well, sir; but I despised all
education, instruction, or correction, like a beast as I was.
R. C. It is true, Solomon says, He that despises reproof is
brutish.
W. A. Ay,-sir, I was brutish indeed, for I murdered my
father: for God’s sake, sir, talk no more about that; sir, I
murdered my poor father.
PR. Ha! a murderer!
Here the priest started (for I interpreted every word as he
spoke) and looked pale: it seems he believed that Will had
really killed his father. -
R. C. No, no, sir, I do not understand him so: Will Atkins,
explain yourself; you did not kill your father, did you, with
your own hands?
W. A. No, sir, I did not cut his throat; but I cut the thread
of all his comforts, and shortened his days: I broke his heart by
the most ungrateful, unnatural return, for the most tender and
affectionate treatment that father ever gave, or child could
receive. ' -
R. C. Well, Idid not ask you about your father, to extort
this confession: I pray God give you repentance for it, and for-
give that and all your other sins; but I asked you because I see
that though you have not much learning, yet you are not so
ignorant as some are in things that are good; that you have
known more of religion, a great deal, than you have practised.
W. A. Though you, sir, did not extort the confession that I
make about my father, conscience does; and whenever we come
to look back upon our lives, the sins against our indulgent
aomnson causes. 858
make lie dee est, and the weight they leave'will lie heaviest
upon the min , of all the sins we can commit.
R. C. You talk too feelingly and sensibly for me, Atkins;
I cannot bear it.
W. A. You bear it, master! I dare say you know nothing of it.
R. C. Yes, Atkins; every shore, every hill, nay, I may say
every tree in this island, is witness to the anguis of my soul
for my ingratitude and bad usage of a good, tender father; a
father much like yours, by your description: and I murdered
my father as well as you, Will Atkins; but I think, for all that,
my repentance is short of yours too, by a great deal.
[would have said more. if Icouid have restrained my pas-

arms; but I thought this poor man’s repentance was so much
sincerer than mine, that I was going to leave of? the discourse
and retire; for I was surprised with what he had said, and
thought that instead of my going about to teach and instruct
him this man was made a teacher and instructor to me in a most
surprising and unexpected manner.
I laid all this before the young clergyman, who was greatly
affected with it, and said to me, Did I not say, sir, that when
this man was converted he would preach to us all? I tell you,
sir, if this one man be made a true penitent, here will be no
need of me ; he will make Christians of all in the island—But
having a little composed myself, I renewed my discourse with
Will Atkins. But, Will, said I, how comes the sense of this
matter to touch you just now?
W. A. Sir, you have set me about a work that has struck a
dart through my very soul; I have been talking about God and
religion to my wife, in order, as you directed me, to make a
Christian of her, and she has preached such a sermon to me as
I shall never forget while I live.
R. C. No, no, it is not your wife has preached to you; but
when you were moving religious arguments to her, conscience

W. A. Ay, sir, with such force as is not to be resisted.
R. C. Pray, Will, let us know what passed between you and
your wife; for I know something of it already.
W. A. Sir, it is impossible to give you a full account of it;
I am too full to hold it, and yet have no tongue to express it;
but let her have said what she will, and though I cannot give
you an account of it, this I can tell you, that I have resolved to
amend and reform my life.
R. C. But tell us some of it: how did you begin, Will? F or

marriage, an what the reasons were that men and women were
obliged to enter into such compacts, as it was neither in the
power of one nor other to break; that otherwise, order and jus-
tice could not be maintained, and men would run from their
wives, and abandon their children, mix confusedly with one
another, and neither families he kept entire, nor inheritances be
settled by legal descent.
R. C. You talk like a civilian, Will. Could you make her
understand what you meant by inheritance and families? They
know no such things among the. savages, but marry any how,
without regard to relation, consan uinity, or family; brother
and sister, nay, as I have been tol , even the father and the
daughter, and the son and the mother.
W A. I believe, sir, you are misinformed, and my wife
assures me of the contrary, and that they abhor it; perhaps,
for any farther relations, they may not be so exact as we are;
but she tells me they never touch one another in the near rela~
tinnship you speak of.
R. C. Well, what did she say to what you told her?
W. A She said she liked it very well, and it was much better
than in her country.
R. C. But did you tell her what marriage was '1
W. A. Ay, ay; there began our dialogue. I asked her if she
would be married to me our way. She asked me what way that
was. I told her marriage was appointed by God ; and here we
had a strange talk together, indeed, as ever man-and wife had,
I believe. .
N. B. This dialogue between Will Atkins and his wife I took
down in writing, just after he had told it me, which was as
follows:
WIFE. Appointed by your God! Why, have you a God in your
country '.'
W. A. Yes, my dear, God is in every country.
WIFE. No your God in my country; my country have the
great old Benamuckee God.

is in heaven, and made the heaven and the earth, the sea, and
all that in them is.
WIFE. No makee de earth; no you God makee all earth; no
makee my country.
Will Atkins laughed a little at her expression of God not
making her country. '
WIFE. No laugh; why laugh me? This nothing to laugh.
He was justly reproved by his wife, for she was more serious
aonmsos causes. 355
W. A. That’s true indeed; I will not laugh any more, my dear.
WIFE. Why you say you God makee all?
W. A. Yes, child, our God made the whole world, and you and
me, and all things ; for he is the only true God, and there is no
God but him; he lives for ever in heaven.
WIFE. Why you no tell me long ago?
W. A. That's true indeed; but I have been a wicked wretch,
and have not only forgotten to acquaint thee with any thing
before, but have lived without God in the world myself.
WIFE. What have you a great God in your country, you no
know him? No say 0 to him? No do good thing for him?
That no possible.
W. A. It is true; though, for all that, we live as if there we!
no God in heaven, or that he had no power on earth.
WIFE. But why God let you do so? Why he no makee you
good live?
W. A. It is all our own fault.
WWI. But you say me he is great, much great, have much
great power, can makee kill when he will, why he no makee kiL
when you no serve him, no say 0 to him, no be good mans?
W. A. That is true, he might strike me dead; and I ought to
expect it, for I have been a wicked wretch, that is true; but God
is merciful, and does not deal with us as we deserve.
WIFE. But then do you not tell God thankee for that too?
W. A. No, indeed, I have not thanked God for his mercy, any
more than I have feared God for his power.
WIFE. Then you God no God; me no think believe he be such
one, great much power, strong: no makee kill you, though you
make him so much angry.
W. A. What, will my wicked life hinder you from believing in
God? What a dreadful creature am I! and what a sad truth
is it, that the horrid lives of Christians hinder the conversion
of heathensT
WIFE. How me think you have great much God up there
(she points up to heaven) and yet no do well, no do good thing?
Can he tell? Sure he no tell what you do?
W. A. Yes, yes, he knows and sees all things; he bears an
speak, sees what we do, knows what we think, though we do not
speak.
WIFE. What! he no hear you curse, swear, sneak de great
damn ?
W. A. Yes, yes, he hears it all.
WIFE. Where be then the much great power strong?
W. A. He is merciful, that is all we can say for it; and this
proves him to be the true God; he is God, and not man, and
therefore we are not consumed.
Here Will Atkins told us he was struck with horror, to think
how he could tell his wife so clearly that God sees, and hears,
and knows the secret thoughts of the heart, and all that we
go, and yet that he had dared to do all the vile things he had
one.
WlFE. Merciful! What you call that?
W. A. He is our father and maker, and he pities and
spares us.
WIFE. So then he never makee kill, never angry when you do
wicked; then he no good himself, or no great able.

WIFE. But no makee kill you yet; then he tell you, may be,
that he no makee you kill: so you makee de bargain with him,
you do bad thing, he no be angry at you when he be angry at
other mans.
W. A. No, indeed; my sins are all presumption! upon hil

he has done other men.
WIFE. Well, and yet no kill, no makee you dead; what you
say to him for that? You no tell him thankee for all that too 2
W. A. I am an unthankt‘ul, ungrateful dog, that is true.
WIFE. Why he no makee you much good better? you say he
makee you.
W. A. He made me, as he made all the world: it is I have
deformed myself and abused his goodness, and made 'myself an
abominable wretch.
WIFE. Iwish you makee God know me; I no makee him
angry, I no do bad wicked thing.
Here Will Atkins said his heart sunk within him, to hear a
poor untaught creature desire to be taught to know God, and be
such a wicked wretch that hecould not say one word to her about
God, but what the reproach of his own carriage would make
most irrational to her to believe; nay, that already she had told
him that she could not believe in God, because he, that was so
wicked, was not destroyed.~
W. A. My dear, you mean, you wish I could teach you to know
God, not God to know you; for he knows you already, and every
thought in your heart.
WIFE. Why then he know what I say to you now; he know
me wish to know him ; how shall me know who makee me?
W. A. Poor creature, he must teach thee, I cannot teach thee;
I will pray to him to teach thee to know him, and forgive me,
that am unworthy to teach thee. _
The poor fellow was in such an agony at her desiring him to
make her know God, and her wishing to know him, that he said
he fell down on his knees before her, and prayed to God to en-
lighten her mind with the saving knowledge of Jesus Christ, and
to pardon his sins, and accept of his being the unworthy instru-
ment of instructing her in the principles of religion: after which
he sat down by her again, and their dialogue went on.-'I‘his
Evasdghe time when we saw him kneel down, and hold up his

WIFE. What you put down the knee for? 'What you hold up
the hand for? What you say? Who you speak to? What is
all that?
W. A. My dear, I how my knees in token of m submission
to him that made me; I said O to him, as you c it; and as
your old men do to their idol Benamuckee; that is, I prayed
to him.
WIFE. What you say 0 to him for?
W. A. I prayed to him to 0 en your eyes, and. your under-
standing, that you may know im, and be accepted by him;
WIFE. Can he do that too?
W. A. Yes, he can; he can do all things.
WIFE. But now he hear what you say?
W. A. Yes ; he has bid us pray to him, and promised to
near us.
WIFE. Bid you pray? When he bid you '! How he bid you?
What, you hear him speak? -
W. A. No, we do not hear him speak; but he has revealed
himself many ways to us.
Here he was at a great loss to make her understand that God
has revealed himselfto us by his word, and what his word was
but at last he told it her thus:
W. A. God has spoken to some good men in former days,
even from heaven, by plain words; and God has inspired good
men by his Spirit; and they have written all his laws down in
a book.
WIFE. Me no understand that; where is book?
W. A. Alas! my poor creature, I have not this book; but
I hope I shall one time or other get it for you, and help you to
read it.
Here he embraced her with great affection; but with inex-
pressible grief that he had not a Bible.
WIFE. But how you makee me know that God teachee them
to write that book?
W. A. By the same rule that we know him to be God.
WIFE. What rule? What way you know him ?
W. 1} Because he teaches and commands nothing but what is
good, righteous, and holy, and tends to make us perfectly good,
as well as perfectly happy; and because he forbids, and commands
us to avoid, all that is wicked, that is evil in itself, or evil in its
consequence.
WIFE. That me would understand, that me fain see; if he
teachee all good thing, he makee all good thing, he give all thing,
he hear me when I say 0 to him, as you do just now; he makes
me good, if I wish to be good; he spare me, no makee kill me,
when I no be good: all this you say he do, yet he be great God:
me take, think, believe him to be great God; me say 0 to him
with you, my dear.
Here the poor man could forbear no longer, but raised her up,
made her kneel by him, and he prayed to God aloud to instruct
her in the knowledge of himself, by his Spirit; and that by some
good providence, if possible, she might some time or other come
to have a Bible, that she might read the word of God, and be
taught by it to know him.—-’I‘his was the time that we saw him
lift her up by the hand, and saw him kneel down by her, as
above. . '
They had several other discourses, it seems, after this, too
long to be set down here ; and particularly she made him
promise, that since he confessed his own life had been a wicked
abomi' “nurse of provocations against God, that he would
reform it, and not make God angry any more; lest he should
make him dead, as she called it, and then she would be left
alone, and never be taught to know this God better; and lest
he should be miserable, as he had told her wicked men would
be, after death.
This was a strange account, and very affecting to us both,
but particularly to the young clergyman; he was indeed won-
nonmsos caosoz. 889
nable that he could not talk to her, that he could not speak
English, to make her understand him; and as she spoke but
very broken English, he could not understand her; however, he
turned himself to me, and told me that he believed that there
must be more to do with this woman than to marry her. I did
nonmsos caosoz. 889
viz. that she ought to be baptized. I agreed with him in that
art readily, and was for going about it presently. No, no;
liold, sir, said he; though I would have her be baptized by all
means, yet I must observe that Will Atkins, her husband, has
indeed brought her, in a wonderful manner, to be willing to
embrace a religious life, and has given her just ideas of the being
of a God; of his power, justice, and mercy: yet I desire to know
of him if he has said anything to her of Jesus Christ, and of the
salvation of sinners; of the nature of faith in him, and redemp-
tion by him; of the Holy Spirit, the resurrection, the last judg~
ment, and a future state.
I called Will Atkins again, and asked him; but the poor fel-
low fell immediately into tears, and told us he had said something
to her of all those things, but that he was himself so wicked a
creature, and his own conscience so reproached him with his
horrid ungodly life, that he trembled at the apprehensions that
her knowledge of him should lessen the attention she should give
_ to those things, and make her rather contemn religion than
receive it; but he was assured, he said, that her mind was so
disposed to receive due impressions of all those things, and that
if I would but discourse With her, she would make it appear to
my satisfaction that my labour would not be lost upon her.
Accordingly, I called her in, and placing myself as interpreter
between my religious priest and the woman, I entreated him to
begin with her ;_ but sure such a sermon was never preached by
a popish priest in these latter ages of the world: and as I told
him, I thought he had all the zeal, all the knowledge, all the
sincerity of a Christian, without the error of a Roman catholic;
and that I took him to be such a clergyman as the Roman
bishops were, before the church of Rome assumed spiritual
sovereignty over the consciences of men. In a word, he brought
the poor woman to embrace the knowledge of Christ, and of
redemption by him, not with wonder and astonishment only, as
nonmsos caosoz. 889
an affection, and a surprising degree of understanding, scarce to
be imagined, much less to be expressed; and. at her own request,
she was baptized.
When he was preparing to baptize her, I entreated him till"

might not perceive he was of the Roman church, if possible
because of other ill consequences which might attend a difference
among us in that very religion which we were instructing the
other in. He told me that as he had no consecrated chapel, nor
840 A DVENTURES or
ner that I should not know by it that he was a Roman catholic
himself, if I had not known it before; and so he did; for saying
only some words over to himself in Latin, which Icould not un-
derstand, he poured a whole dishful of water upon the woman's
head, pronouncing in French very loud, “ Mary,” (which was
the name her husband desired me to give her, for I was her god-
father,) “ I baptize thee in the name of the Father, and of the
Son, and of the Holy Ghost," so that none could know any-
thing by it what religion he was of. He gave the benediction
afterwards in Latin, but either Will Atkins did not know but it
was French, or else did not take notice of it at that time.
As soon as this was over, we married them; and after the
marriage was over, he turned to Will Atkins, and in a very
affectionate manner exhorted him, not only to persevere in that
good disposition he was in, but to support the convictions that
were upon him by a resolution to reform his life; told him it
was in vain to say he repented if he did not forsake his crimes:
represented to him how God had honoured him with being the
instrument of bringing his wife to the knowledge of the Christian
religion, and that he should be careful he did not dishonour the
race of God; and that if he did, he would see the heathen a
etter Christian than himself; the savage converted, and the
instrument cast away. He said a great many good things to
them both; and then recommending them to God's goodness,
gave them the benediction again, I repeating every thing to them
in English; and thus ended the ceremony. I think it was the
most pleasant and agreeable day to me that ever I passed in
my whole life. 4
But my clergyman had not done yet; his thoughts hung con-
tinually upon the conversion of the thirty-seven savages, and
fain he would have stayed upon the island to have undertaken
840 A DVENTURES or
ticable in itself; and, secondly, that perhaps I would put it into
a way of being done in his absence to his satisfaction; of which
by and by.
Having thus brought the affairs of the island to a narrow
compass, I was preparing to go on board the ship, when the
young man I had taken out of the famished ship’s company
came to me. and told me he understood I had a clergyman with
me, and that I had caused the Englishmen to be married to the
savages; that he had a match, too, which he desired might be
nosmso»: meson. 841
Would not be disagreeable to me.
I knew this must be the young woman who was his mother’s
servant, for there was no other Christian woman on the island,
so I began to persuade him not to do anything of that kind rashly,
or because he found himself in this solitary circumstance. I re-
presented to him that he had some considerable substance in the
world, and good friends, as I understood by himself, and the
maid also ; that the maid was not only poor, and a servant, but
was unequal to him, she being six or seven-and-twenty years
old, and he not being seventeen or eighteen; that he might very
probably, with my assistance, make a remove from this wilder-
ness, and come into his own country again; and that then it
would be a thousand to one but he would repent his choice,
and the dislike of that circumstance might be disadvantageous
to both. I was going to say more, but he interrupted me,
smiling, and told me, with a great deal of modesty, that I mis-
took in my guesses, that he had nothing of that kind in his
thoughts; and he was very glad to hear that I had an intent of
putting them in a way to see their own country again; and
nothing should have put him upon staying there, but that-the
voyage I was going was so exceeding long and hazardous, and
would carry him quite out of the reach of all his friends; that
he had nothing to desire of me, but that I would settle him in
some little property in the island where he was, give him a ser-
vant or two, and some few necessaries, and he would settle
himself here like a planter, waiting the good time when, if ever
I returned to England, I would redeem them; and hoped I would
not be unmindful of him when I came to England: that he would
give me some letters to his friends in London, to let them know
how good I had been to him, and in what art of the world, and
what circumstances I had left him in; antfhe promised me that
whenever I redeemed him, the plantation, and all the improve-
ments he had made upon it, let the value be What it would,
should be wholly mine.
His discoursewas veryprettily delivered, considering his youth,
and was the more agreeable to me, because he told me ositively
the match was not for himself. I gave him all possi le assu-
rances that if I lived to come safe to England, I would deliver
his letters, and do his business effectually; and that he might
depend I should never forget the circumstances I had left him
in: but still I was impatient to know who was the person to be
married: upon which he told me it was my Jack-of-all-tradel
and his maid Susan. I was mzst agreeably surprised when he
named the match; for indeed l thought it very suitable. The
character of that man I have given already; and as for the maid,
she was a very honest, modest, sober, and religious young wo~
man; had a very good share of sense, was agreeable enough in
her person, spoke very handsomely, and to the purpose, always
with decency and good manners, and neither too backward to
speak, when requisite, nor impertinently forward, when it was
not her business : very handy and housewifely, and an excellent
342 ADVENTURES or
and she knew very well how to behave in every respect.
The match being proposed in this manner, we married them
the same day; and as I was father at the altar, as I may say,
and gave her away, so I gave her a portion; forI appointed her
and her husband a handsome large space of ground for their
plantation; and, indeed, this match, and the proposal the young
gentleman made to give him a small property in the island, put
me upon parcelling it out amongst them, that they might not
quarrel afterwards about their situation.
This sharing out the land to them I left to Will Atkins, who
was now grown a sober, grave, managing fellow, perfectly re-
formed, exceedingly pious and religious, and, as far as I may be
allowed to speak positivelyin such a case, I verily believe he was
a true penitent. He divided things so justly, and so much to
every one’s satisfaction, that they only desired one general
writing under my hand for the whole, which I caused to be draw:
up, and signed and sealed to them, setting out the bounds and
situation of every man’s plantation, and testifying that I gave
them thereby severally a right to the whole possession and in-
heritance of the respective plantations or farms, with their im-
provements, to them and their heirs, reserving all the rest of
the island as my own property, and a certain rent for every par-
ticular plantation after eleven years, if I, or any one from me,
or in my name, came to demand it, producing an attested copy
of the same writing.
As to the government and laws among them, I told them I was
not capable of giving them better rules than they were able to
give themselves; only I made them promise me to live in love
and good neighbourhood with one another; and so I prepared
to leave them.
One thing I must not omit, and that is, that being new settled
in a kind of commonwealth among themselves, and having much
business in hand, it was but odd to have seven-and-thirty Indians
live in a nook of the island, independent, and, indeed, unem-
ployed; for, excepting the providing themselves food, which
342 ADVENTURES or
ner of business or property to manage. I proposed, therefore,
to the governor Spaniard, that he should go to them, with
Friday's father, and propose to them to remove, and either
plant for themselves, or take them into their several families
as Wants, to be maintained for their labour, but without being
absolute slaves ; for I would not admit them to make them slave!
by force, by any means; because they had their liberty given them
by capitulation, as it were articles of surrender, which they ought
not to break.
They most willingly embraced the proposal, and came all
very cheerful along with him: so we allotted them land, and
plantations, which three or four accepted of, but all the rest
chose to be employed as servants in the several families we had
settled; and thus my colony was in a manner settled, as fol-
lows :—The Spaniards possessed my original habitation, which
was the capital city, and extended their plantations all along
the side of the brook, which made the creek that l have so often
described, as far as my bower; and as they increased their cul-
ture, it went always eastward. The English lived in the north-
east part, where Will Atkins and his comrades began, and came
on southward and south-west, towards the back part of the
Spaniards ; and eve plantation had a great addition of land to
take in, if they foun occasion, so that they need not jostle one
another for want of room. All the east end of the island was
left uninhabited, that if any of the savages should come on shore
there only for their usual customary barbarities, they might come
and go ; if they disturbed nobody, nobody would disturb them;
and no doubt but they were often ashore, and went awa again,
for I never heard that the planters were ever attacked or dis-
turbed any more.
It now came into my thoughts that I had hinted to my friend
the clerg man that the work of convertin the savages might
perhaps be set on foot'in his absence to is satisfaction, and
told him that now I thought it was put in a fair way; for the
savages being thus divided among the Christians, if they would
but every one of them do their part with those which came under
their hands, I hoped it might have a very good effect.
He agreed presently in that, if they did their part. But how,
says he, shall we obtain that of them? I'told him we would
call them all together, and leave it in charge with them, or go
to them, one by one, which he thoughtbest ; so we divided it.
he to speak to the Spaniards, who were all papists, and I to
the En lish, who were all protestants; and we recommended it
earnesSy to them, and made them promise that they would
never make any distinction of plapist or protestant in their
exhorting the savages to turn C ristians, but teach them the
general knowledge of the true God, and of their Saviour Jesus
Christ; and they likewise promised us that they would never
have any differences or disputes one with another about re-
on.
When I came to Will Atkins's house (I may call it so, for
such a house, or such a piece of basket-work, I believe. was
not standing in the world again), there I found the young
woman I have mentioned above, and Will Atkins's wife, were
become intimates; and this prudent, religious young woman,
had perfected the work Will Atkins had begun: and though it
was not above four days after what I have related, yet the
new-baptized savage woman was made such a Christian as I
have seldom heard of in all my observation or conversation in
the world.
It came next into my mind, in the morning before I went to
them, that amongst all the needful things I had to leave With
them, I had not left them a Bible, in which I showed myself less
considering for them than my good friend the widow was for me,
when she sent me the cargo of a hundred pounds from Lisbon,
where she packed up three Bibles and a prayer-book. How-
ever, the good woman's charity had a greater extent than ever
she imagined, for they were reserved for the comfort and instruc-
tion of those that made much better use of them than I had done.
I took one of the Bibles in in pocket, and when I came to
Will Atkins’s tent, or house, an found the young woman and
Atkins's baptized wife had been discoursing of religion together,
for Will Atkins told it me with a great deal of joy, I asked
if they were together now, and he said yes; so I went into
the house, and he with me, and we found them together very
earnest in discourse. O sir, says Will Atkins, when God has
sinners to reconcile to himself, and aliens to bring home, he
never wants a messenger; my wife has got a new instructor;
I knew I was as unworthy as I was incapable of that work; that
young woman has been sent hither from heaven ; she is enough
to convert a whole island of savages. The young woman
blushed, and rose up to go away, but Idesired her to sit still,
I told her she had a good work upon her hands, and I hoped God
would bless her in it.
We talked a little, and I did not perceive they had any book
among them, though I did not ask: but I put my hand into my
pocket, and pulled out my Bible; Here, says I to Atkins, I have
rought you an assistant that perhaps you had not before. The
man was so confounded that he was not able to speak for some
time; but recovering himself, he takes it with both his hands,
and turning to his wife, Here, my dear, says he, did I not tell
on our God, though he lives above, could hear what we said?
ere’s the book I prayed for when you and I kneeled down
under the bush; now God has heard us, and sent it. When
he had said so, the man fell into such transports of passionate
joy, that between the joy of having it, and giving God thanks
for_ it, the tears ran down his face like a child that was
crying. .
_The woman was surprised, and was like to have run into a

for anything of its kind than he was for the Bible; nor, I believe,
never any man was glad of a Bible from a better principle; and

tory, or, to appearance, insensible of instruction; for, if ever
God, in his providence, touches the conscience of such, the force
of their education returns upon them, and the early instruction
of parents is not lost, though it may have been many years laid

Thus it was with this poor man: however ignorant he was of
religion and Christian knowledge, he found he had some to do
with now more ignorant than himself, and that the least part of
the instruction of his good father that now came to his mind
was of use to him.
Among the rest it occurred to him, he said, how his father
used to insist so much on the inexpressible value of the Bible,
the privilege and blessing of it to nations, families, and persons:
but he never entertained the least notion of the worth of it till
now, when being to talk to heathens, savages, and barbarians,
he wanted the help of the written oracle for his assistance.
The young woman was glad of it also for the present occasion,
though she had one, and so had the youth, on board our ship,
among their goods, which were not yet brought on shore. And
now having said so many things of this young woman, I canno‘
\
omit telling one story more of her and myself, which has some
thing in it very informing and remarkable.
I have related to what extremity the poor young woman was
reduced, how her mistress was starved to death, and died on
board that unhappy ship we met at sea, and how the whole ship’s
company was reduced to the last extremity. The gentlewoman

brought to the last extremity of hunger.—One day, being dis-
coursing with her on the extremities they suffered, I asked her
if she could describe, by what she had felt, what it was to starve
and how it appeared? She told me she believed she could, and
she told her tale very distinctly, thus :
First, sir, said she, we had for some days fared exceeding
hard, and suffered very great hunger: but at last we were
wholly without food of any kind, except sugar, and a little wine

and slept about three hours, and awaked a little refreshed,
having taken a glass of wine when I lay down: after being

The second night, being obliged to go to bed again without
any food, more than a draught of fresh water, and being asleep,
I dreamed I was at Barbadoes, and that the market was
mightily stocked with provisions; that I bought some for my
mistress, and went and dined very heartily. I thought my
stomach was as full after this as it would have been after a
good dinner; but when I awaked, I was exceedingly sunk in

agreeable fumes from the stomach into the head; and I lay,
as they told me, stupid and senseless, as one drunk, for some
time. The third day, in the morning, after a night of strange,
confused, and inconsistent dreams, and rather dozing than
sleeping, I awaked ravenous and furious with hunger; and I
question, had not my understanding returned and conquered
it, whether, if I had been a mother, and had had a little child
with me, its life would have been safe or not. This lasted
about three hours; during which time I was twice raging mad

abated, and so did the ravenous part of the hunger. Then I grew
sick, and retched to vomit, but could not, for I had nothing in
my stomach to bring up. After I had bled some time, I swooned,
and they all believed I was dead; but I came to myself soon
after, and then had a most dreadful pain in my stomach, not to
be described, not like the colic, but a gnawing, eager pain for
food; and towards the night it went off, with a kind of earnest
wishing or longing for food, something like, as I suppose, the
longing of a woman with child. I took another draught of water,
with sugar in it; but my stomach loathed the sugar, and brought
it all up again: then I took a draught of water without sugar,
and that stayed with me; and I laid me down upon the bed,
praying most heartily that it would please God to take me away;
and composing my mind in hopes of it, I slumbered awhile, and
then waking, thought myself dying, being light with vapours
from an empty stomach; I recommended my soul then to God,
and earnestly wished that somebody would throw me into the
sea.
All this while my mistress lay by me, just, as I thought, ex-
iring, but bore it with much more patience than I; gave the
ast bit of bread she had left to her child, my young master, who
would not have taken it, but she obliged him to eat it; and I
believe it saved his life. ' '

creature appointed for food; and once or twice I was going to
bite my own arm: at last I saw the basin in which was the
blood I had bled at my nose the day before: I ran to it, and
swallowed it with such haste, and such a greedy appetite, as if
I wondered nobody had taken it before, and afraid it should be
taken from me now. After it was down, though the thoughts of

I took another draught of water, and was composed and refreshed
for some hours after. This was the fourth day; and thus I held
it till towards night; when, within the compass of three hours,
I had all the several circumstances over again, one after another.

but in the hope that I should die before morning.
All this night I had no sleep; but the hunger was now turned
into a disease; and I had a terrible colic and griping, by wind,
instead of food, having found its way into the bowels; and in
this condition I lay till morning, when I was surprised with the
cries and lamentations of my young master, who called out to
me that his mother was dead: I lifted myself up a little, for
I had not strength to rise, but found she was not dead, though
she was able to give very little signs of life.
I had then such convulsions in my stomach, for want of some
sustenance, that I cannot describe; with such frequent throes
and pangs of appetite, that nothing but the tortures of death
can imitate; and in this condition I was when I heard the sea-
men above cry out, A sail! a sail! and halloo and jump about
as if they were distracted.

less; and my young master was so sick, that I thought he had
been expiring; so we could not open the cabin door, or get any
account what it was that occasioned such confusion; nor had we
any conversation with the ship's company for two days, they
having told us that they had not a mouthful of anything to eat
in the ship; and this they told us afterwards, they thought we
had been dead. It was this dreadful condition we were in when
you were sent to save our lives: and how you found us, sir, you
now as well as I, and better too.
This was her own relation, and is such a distinct account of
starving to death, as, I confess, I never met with, and was ex-
ceeding entertaining to me. I am the rather apt to believe it
, to be a true account, because the youth gave me an account 0!
a good part of it; though, I must own, not so distinct and
so feeling as the maid: and the rather, because it seems his
mother fed him at the price of her own life; but the poor maid,
though her constitution being stronger than that of her mis-
tress, who wal in years, and a weakly woman too, she might
struggle harder with it: I say, the poor maid might be sup-
posed to feel the extremity something sooner than her mistress,
who might be allowed to keep the last bit something longer
than she parted with any to relieve the maid. No uestion,
as the case is here related, if our ship, or some other, ad not
so providentially met them, a few days more wouldhave ended
all their lives, unless they had prevented it by eating one
another; and that even, as their case stood, would have served

I saw plainly. had I set up the sloop, and left it among them,

war against any that should invade them, but not to set them
up for an offensive war, or to go abroad to attack others; which,
in the end, would only bring ruin and destruction upon them:
I reserved the sloop, therefore, and the guns, for their service
another way, as I shall observe in its place.

ENCOUNTER WITI-I SAVAGES AT SEA .—-FR.IDAY’S DEATH.—ROBINSON
FINDS HIS FORMER PARTNER IN THE BRAZILS.——SAILS FOR THE
EAST INDIES.
' 350 anvss'runss or
sail, and arrived at the bay of All Saints, in the Brazils, in about
twenty-two days, meeting nothing remarkable in our passage but
this: that about three days after we had sailed, being becalmed,
and the current setting strong to the E.N. E., running, as it were,
into a bay or gulf on the land side, we were driven something out
of our course, and once or twice our men cried out, Land to the
eastward; but whether it was the continent or islands we could
not tell by any means. But the third day, towards evening, the
sea smooth, and the weather calm, we saw the sea, as it were
covered towards the land with something very black; not being
able to discover what it was, till after some time, our chief mate.
going up the main-shrouds a little way, and looking at them with
a perspective, cried out it was an army. I could not imagine
what he meant by an army, and thwarted him a little hastily.

too; for I believe there are a thousand canoes, and you may see
them paddle along, for the are coming towards us space.
I was a. little surprised, then, indeed, and so was my nephew the
captain ; forhe had heard such terrible stories of them in the island,
and having never been in those seas before, that he could not tell
what to think of it, but said, two or three times, we should all be
devoured. I must confess, considering we were becalmed, and the
current set strong towards the shore, I liked it the worse; how'-
ever, I bade them not be afraid, but bring the ship to an anchor
as soon as we came so near to know that we must engage them.
The weather continued calm, and they came on space
towards us; so I gave order to come to an anchor, and set
all our sails: as for the savages, I told them they had nothing

stern, and man them both well, and wait the issue in that
posture: this I did, that the men in the boats might be ready

In this posture we lay by for them, and in a little while they
came up with us; but never was such ahorrid sight seen by
Christians: though my mate was much mistaken in his calcula~
tion of their number, yet when they came up we reckoned about
a hundred and twenty-six; some of them had sixteen or seven-
teen men in them, some more, and the least six or seven.
When they came nearer to us, they seemed to be struck with
wonder and astonishment, as at a sight which doubtless they

up, however, very near to us, and seemed to go about to row
round us; but we called to our men in the boats not to let them
come too near them. This very order brought us to an engage-

with their hands to keep them back, which they understood

into the boat, and the carpenter presently set up a kind of fence,
like waste boards, to cover them from the arrows of the savages,
if they should shoot again.
About half an hour afterwards they all came up in a body
astern of us, and so near, as that we could easily discern what
they were, though we could not tell their design; and I easily
found they were some of my old friends, the same sort of
savages that Ihad been used to engage with; and 'in a short
time more they rowed a little farther out to sea, till they came
directly broadside with us, and then rowed down straight upon
us, till they came so near that they could hear us speak: upon
this I ordered all my men to keep close, lest they should shoot
any more arrows, and made all our guns ready; but being so
near as to be within hearing, I made Friday go out upon the
deck, and call out aloud to them in his language, to know
what they meant; which accordingly he did. Whether they
understood him or not, that I knew not; but as soon as he had
called to them, six of them, who were in the foremost or ni hest

showed us their naked backsides, just as if, in English, saving
your presence, they had bid as kiss —: whether this was a

mere contempt, or as a signal to the rest; but immediately
Friday cried out they were going to shoot, and, unhappily for
852 anvsmuass or
arrows, and, to my inexpressible grief, killed poor Friday, no
other man being in their sight. The poor fellow was shot with
no less than three arrows, and about three more fell very near
him; such unlucky marksmen they were!
I was so enraged at the loss of my old trusty servant ano

oroadside as they had never heard in their lives before, to be

.one shot only.
The ill manners of turning up their bare backsides to us gave
us no great offence; neither did I know for certain whether
that which would ass for the greatest contempt among us
might be understood so by them or not; therefore, in return,

were capable of, and especially as they had killed my poor Friday,
whom I so entirely loved and valued, and who, indeed, so well
852 anvsmuass or
man, but would have been very glad if I could have overset every
canoe there, and drowned every one of them.
I can neither tell how many we killed, nor how many we
wounded, at this broadside, but sure such a fright and hurry
never was seen among such a multitude; there were thirteen or
fourteen of their canoes split and overset in all, and the men all
set a swimming: the rest, frightened out of their wits, scoured
away as fast as they could, taking but little care to save those
whose boats were split or spoiled with our shot; so I suppose
that many of them were lost; and our men took up one poor
fellow swimming for his life, above an hour after they were all
one.

great many; but, in short, we never knew any thing how it went

we could not see above three or four straggling canoes, nor did
we ever see the rest any more; for a breeze of wind springing
up the same evening, we weighed, and set sail for the Brazils.
We had a prisoner, indeed, but the creature was so sullen
that he would neither eat nor speak, and we all fancied he
would starve himself to death: but I touk a way to cure him;
for I made them take him and turn him into the longboat, and

leave him where they found him, if he would not speak : nor
would that do, but they really did throw him into the sea, and
came away from him , and then he followed them, for he swam
like a cork, and called to them, in his tongue, though they knew
not one word of what he said: however, at last they took him in
again, and then he began to be more tractable; nor did I ever
design they should drown him.
We were now under sail again; but I was the most discon-
solate creature alive for want of my man Friday, and would have
been very glad to have gone back to the island to have taken
one of the rest from thence for my occasion; but it could not
be; so we went on. We had one prisoner, as I have said, and
it was a long time before we could make him understand any
thing; but, in time, our men taught him some English, and he
began to be a little tractable. Afterwards, we inquired what
country he came from, but could make nothing of what he said;
for his speech was so odd, all gutturals, and he s oke in the
throat in such a hollow, odd manner, that we coul never form
a word after him ; and we were all of opinion that they might
speak that language as well if the were gagged as otherwise:
nor could we perceive that they had any occasion either for
teeth, tongue, lips, or palate, but formed their words just as a
hunting horn forms a tune, with an open throat. He told us,

that all those natives, as also those of Africa, when they learn
English, always add two e’s at the end of the words where we use
one ; and they place the accent upon them, as makee, takee, and
the like; and we could not break them of it ; nay, I could hardly
make Friday leave it off, though at last he did. ‘

I granted this presently, and joined my Englishman with

on board our ship, till the sloop put out to go to sea; and then,
having put all their goods on board some time before, we put
them on board the sloop after she war got out of the bay.
Our seaman was mightily pleased With this new partner; and
their stocks, indeed, were much alike rich in tools, in prepara-

All this cargo arrived safe, and, as you may easily suppose,
was very welcome to my old inhabitants, who were now, with
this addition, between sixty and seventy people, besides little
children, of which there were a great many. I found letters at
London from them all, by way of Lisbon, when I came back to
England, of which I shall also take some notice immediately.

about it; and whoever reads the rest of my memorandums

to read of the follies of an old man, not warned by his own

any prince, or to call my people subjects to any one nation more

but left it, as I found it, belonging to nobody, and the people under
no discipline or government but my own; who, though I had

and came there no more, the last letters I had from any of them
were by my partner's means, who afterwards sent another sloop
to the place, and who sent me word, though I had not the letter

heard of the second part of the travels and adventures of Robin-
son Crusoe: so I must here leave exclaiming at myself, and go
on with my voyage. From the Brazils we made directly over
the Atlantic Sea to the Cape of Good Hope, and had a tolerable
good voya e, our course generally south-east, now and then a
storm, an some contrary winds, but my disasters at sea were
at an end; my future rubs and cross events were to befal me
on shore, that it might appear the land was as well prepared to
be our scourge as the sea.
Our ship was on a trading voyage, and had a supercargo on
board, who was to direct all or motions after she arrived at the
Cape, only being limited to a certain number of days for stay,
by charter-party, at the several ports she was to go to. This
was none of my business, neither did I meddle with it; my
nephew, the captain, and the supercargo, adjusting all those

ship’s use.
We were obliged to stay here some time after we had fur-
nished ourselves with provisions; and I, who was always too
curious to look into every nook of the world wherever I came,
uosmson (.1! "son. 3.50
was for going on shore as often as I could. It was on the east
side of the island that we went on shore one evening; and the
people, who, by the way, are very numerous, came thronging
about us, and stood gazing at us at a distance; but as we had
traded freely with them, and had been kindly used, we thought
ourselves in no danger; but when we saw the people, we out
three boughs out of a tree, and~stuck them up at a distance
from us; which, it seems, is a mark in that country, not only of
a truce and friendship, but when it is accepted, the other side
sets up three poles or boughs, which is a signal that they accept
the truce too ; but then this is a known condition of the truce,
that you are not to pass beyond their three poles, towards them,
nor they to come past your three poles, or boughs, towards
you; so that you are perfectly secure within the three poles,
and all the space between your poles and theirs is allowed like

is offered them, and the truce thereby broken, away they
run to the oles, and lay hold of their weapons, and the truce
is at an end?
It happened one evening when we went on shore, that a greater
number of their people came down than usual, but all very friendl
and civil; and they brought several kinds of provisions, for which
uosmson (.1! "son. 3.50
brought us milk and roots, and several things very acceptable
to us, and all was quiet; and we made us a little tent or but of
some boughs of trees, and lay on shore all night.
I know not what was the occasion, but Iwas not so well satis-
uosmson (.1! "son. 3.50
about a stone's cast from the land, with two men in her to take
care of her, I made one of them come on shore; and getting
some boughs of trees to cover us also in the boat, I spread the
sail on the bottom of the boat, and lay under the cover of the
branches of the trees all night in the boat.
About two o’clock in the morning we heard one of our men
make a terrible noise on the shore, calling out, for God's sake,
to bring the boat in, and come and help them, for they were all

muskets, which was the number of the guns they had, and that
three times over; for, it seems, the natives here were not so
easily frightened with guns as the savages were in America,
where I had to do with them. All this while I knew not what
was the matter, but rousing immediately from sleep with the
noise, I caused the boat to be thrust in, and resolved, with three
fusees we had on board, to land and assist our men.
We got the boat soon to the shore, but our men were in too
much haste; for being come to the shore, they plunged into the
water, to get to the boat with all the expedition they could, being
pursued by between three and four hundred men. Our men

the rest had pistols and swords, indeed, but they were of small
use to them.
36C ADVENTURES 0!
three of them being very ill wounded; and that which was still
worse was, that while we stood in the boat to take our men in,
we were in as much danger as they were in on shore; for they
poured their arrows in upon us so thick, that we were glad to
arricade the side of the boat up with the benches, and two or
three loose boards, which, to our great satisfaction, we had by
mere accident in the boat. And yet, had it been daylight, they
are, it seems, such exact marksmen. that if they could have seen
but the least part of an of us, they would have been sure of us.
We had, by the light 0 the moon, a little sight of them, as they
stood pelting us from the shore with darts and arrows; and
36C ADVENTURES 0!
could ear, by t e cries of some of them, had wounded several;
however, they stood thus in battle array on the shore till break
of day, which we suppose was that they might see the better to
take their aim at us.
In this condition we lay, and could not tell how to weigh our
anchor or set up our sail, because we must needs stand up in the
boat, and they were sure to hit us as we were to hit a bird in a
tree with small shot. We made signals of distress to the ship,
which, though she rode a league off, yet my nephew the captain,

us; and wei hing anchor with all speed, he stood as near the
shore as he furst with the ship, and then sent another boat, with
ten hands in her, to assist us: but we called to them not to
come too near, telling them what condition we were in; how-
ever they stood in near to us, and one of the men taking the end
of a tow-line in his hand, and keeping one boat between him
and the enemy, so that they could not erfectly see him, swam
on board us, and made fast the line to t e boat; upon which we
slipped out a little cable, and leaving our anchor behind, they
towed us out of the reach of the arrows; we all the while lying
close behind the barricade we had made.
As soon as we were got from between the ship and the shore,
that we could lay her side to the shore, she run along just by
them, and poured in a broadside amon'Jr them loaded with pieces
of iron and lead, small bullets, and sudh stuff, besides the great
shot, v'vhich made a terrible havoc among them.
. When we were got on board and out of danger, we had time
” examine into the occasion of this fray; and, indeed, our
supereergo, who had been often in those parts, put me upon it;
for he said he was sure the inhabitants would not have touched
us after we had made a truce, if we had not done something to
provoke them to it. At length it came out that an old woman
who had come to sell us some milk, had brought it within our
poles, and a young woman with her, who also brought some
roots or herbs; and while the old woman (whether she was
mother to the young woman or no they could not tell) was sell-
ing us the milk, one of our men offered some rudeness to the
Wench that was with her, at which the old woman made a great
noise; however, the seaman would not quit his prize, but carried
her out of the old woman’s sight among the trees, it being almost
dark: the old woman went away without her, and, as we may
suppose, made an outcry among the people she came from, who,
upon notice, raised this great army upon us in three or four
hours; and it was great odds but we had all been destroyed.
One of our men was killed with a lance thrown at him just
at the beginning of the attack, as he sallied out of the tent they
had made: the rest came off free, all but the fellow who was
the occasion of all the mischief, who paid dear enough for his
black mistress, for we could not hear what became of him a
great while. We lay upon the shore two days after, though the
wind presented, and made signals for him, and made our boat
sail up shore and down shore several leagues, but in vain, so we
were obliged to give him over; and if he alone had suffered for
it, the loss had been less.
I could not satisfy myself, however, without venturing on
shore once more, to try if I could learn any thing of him or
them: it was the third night after the action that I had a great
mind to learn, if I could by any means, what mischief we had
done, and how the game stood on the Indians’ side. I was
careful to do it in the dark, lest we should be attacked again;
but I ought, indeed, to have been sure that the men I went with
had been under my command, before I engaged in a thing so
hazardous and mischievous, as I was brought into by it with-
out design.
We took twenty as stout fellows with us as any in the ship,
besides the supercargo and myself, and we landed two hours
before midnight, at the same place where the Indians stood
drawn up in the evening before: I landed here, because my

we had done them; and I thought if we could surprise one or.
two of them, perhaps we might get our man again, by way of
exchange.
We landed without any noise, and divided our men into two
bodies, whereof the boatswain commanded one, and I the other.
We neither saw nor heard any body stir when we landed; and
we marched up, one body at a distance from the other, to the
862 ADVENTURES O!
862 ADVENTURES O!
over a dead body. This made them halt awhile; for knowing
by the circumstances that they were at the place where the
Indians had stood, they waited for my coming up there. We con—
cluded to halt till the moon began to rise, which we knew would
be in less than an hour, when we could easily discern the havoc
we had made among them. We told thirty-two bodies upon the
ground, whereof two were not quite dead; some had an arm, and
862 ADVENTURES O!
we suppose, the had carried away.
When we ha made, as I thought, a full discovery of all we
could come to the knowledge of, I was resolved for going on
board; but the boatswain and his party sent me word that they
were resolved to make a visit to the Indian town, where these
dogs, as they called them, dwelt, and asked me to go alon with
862 ADVENTURES O!

Had they sent to ask my leave to go, I knew well enough
what answer to have given them; for I should have commanded
862 ADVENTURES O!
to run, who had a ship, and ship-loading in our charge, and a
voyage to make which depended very much upon the lives of
'the men; but as they sent me word they were resolved to go,
and only asked me and my company to go along with them, I
positively refused it, and rose up, for I was sitting on the ground.
in order to go to the boat. One or two of the men began to
importune me to go; and when I refused, began to grumble,
and say that they were not under my command, and they would
go. Come, Jack, says one of the men, will you go with me?
I’ll go for one. Jack said he would—and then another,—and,
in a word they all left me but one, whom I persuaded to stay,
and a boy left in the boat. So the supercargo and I, with the
third man, went back to the boat, where we told them we would
stay for them, and take care to take in as many of them as
should be left; for I told them it was a. mad thing they were
going about, and supposed most of them would run the fate of
Tom Jeffry.
They told me, like seamen, they would warrant it they would

went. I entreated them to consider the ship and the voyage,
that their lives were not their own, and that they were entrusted
with the v0 age, in some measure; that if the miscarried, the
ship might e lost for want of their help, an that they could
not answer for ‘it to God or man. But I might as well have
talked to the mainmast of the ship; they were mad upon their
journey, only they gave me good words, and begged I would
not be angry; that they did not doubt but they would be back
again in about an hour at farthest; for the Indian town, they

two miles before they got to it.
Well, they all went away; and though the attempt was des-
perate, and such as none but madmen would have gone about,
yet, to give them their due, they went about it as warily as
oldly: they were gallantly armed, for they had every man a
fusee or musket, a bayonet, and a pistol; some of them had
broad cutlasses, some of them had hangers, and the boatswain
and two more had poleaxes ; besides all which they had among
them thirteen hand-grenadoes: holder fellows, and better pro-
vided, never went about any wicked work in the world.
When they went out, their chief design we plunder, and they

for there were not above twelve or thirteen houses ; and where
the town was, or how big, they knew not. They consulted.
therefore, what to do, and were some time before they could
resolve; for if they fell upon these, they must cut all their
throats, and it was ten to one but some of them might escape,
it being in the night, though the moon was up; and if one
escaped, he would run and raise all the town, so they should
have a whole army upon them: again, on the other hand, it
they went away and left those untouched, for the people were
all asleep, they could not tell which way to look for the town :
however, the last was the best advice ; so they resolved to leave
them, and look for the town as well as they could. They went
on a little way, and found a cow tied to a tree; this, they pre-
sently concluded, would be a good guide to them ; for, they said,
the cow certainly belonged to the town before them, or to the
town behind them; and if they untied her, they hould see which
way she went: if she went back, they had nothing to say to her;
but, if she went forward, they would follow her: so they cut the,

town, and see wliat dimensions it was of, and if they might
venture upon it or no.
They did so, and desperately resolved that they would venture
upon them: but while they were animating one another to the
work, three of them, who were a little before the rest, called out
364 ADVEN TURFS 0P
they all ran up to the place, where they found the poor fellow
hanging up naked by one arm, and his throat cut. There was
an Indian house just by the tree, where they found sixteen or
seventeen of the principal Indians, who had been concerned in
the fray with us before, and two or three of them wounded with
our shot; and our men found they were awake, and talking one
to another in that house, but knew not their number.
The sight of their poor mangled comrade so enraged them, as
before, that they swore to one another they would be revenged,
and that not an Indian that came into their hands should have
any quarter; and to work they went immediately, and yet not
so madly as might be expected from the rage and fur they were

began to rush out to save their lives, but met with their fate in

but called for a hand-grenade, and threw it among them, which

most of the Indians who were in the open part of the house were

to the door, which the boatswain and two more kept, with their
bayonets on the muzzles of their pieces, and dispatched all that
came in their way: but there was another apartment in the
house, where the prince or king, or whatever he was, and several
others were; and these were kept in till the house, which was

me and the supercargo, what would become of us; and, at last,
though he could ill spare any more men, yet not knowing what
exigence we might be in, he takes another boat, and with thir-

He was surprised to see me and the supercargo in the boat,
with no more than two men; and though he was glad that we
were well, yet he was in the same impatience with us to know
lonmsou cavson. 366
in short, it was next to an impossibility for any man in the
world to restrain their curiosity to know what had happened,
or their concern for the safety of the men : in a word, the cap-
tain told me he would go and help his men, let what would
come. I argued with him, as I did before with the men, the
safety of the ship, the danger of the voyage, the interest of the
owners and merchants, &c., and told him I and the two men
would go, and only see if we could at a distance learn what was
like to be the event, and come back and tell him. It was all
one to talk to my nephew, as it was to talk to the rest before;
he would go, he said; and he only wished he had left but ten
men in the ship ; for he could not think of having his men lost
for want of help; he had rather lose the ship, the voyage, and
his life and a1] ; and away he went.
I was no more able to stay behind now than I was to persuade
them not to go: so, in short, the captain ordered two men to
row back the pinnace, and fetch twelve men more, leaving the
long-boat at an anchor; and that when they came back, six men
should keep the two boats, and six more come after us: so that
he left only sixteen men in the ship; for the whole ship's com-

horror. I must confess I was never at the sacking a city, or at
the taking a town by storm. I had heard of Oliver Cromwell
taking Drogheda, in Ireland, and killing man, woman, and child;
and I had read of Count Tilly sacking the city of Magdeburg,
and cutting the throats of twenty-two thousand of all sexes;
but I never had an idea of the thing itself before, nor is it pos-
sible to describe it, or the horror that was upon our minds at
hearing it. However, we went on, and at length came to the

were in the utmost confusion. We advanced a little way farther;
and, behold, to our astonishment, three naked women, and cry-

and after them sixteen or seventeen men, natives, in the same
terror and consternation, with three of our English butchers in

our sight. When the rest saw us, believing us to be their
enemies, and that we would murder them as well as those that
pursued them, they set up a most dreadful shriek, especially the
women, and two of them fell down, as if already dead, with the
fright.
My very soul shrunk within me, and my blood ran chill in my
veins, when I saw this; and I believe, had the three En lish
sailors that pursued them come on, I had made our men kill t em

know that we would not hurt them; and immediately they came
up to us, and kneeling down with their hands lifted up, made
piteous lamentation to us to save them, which we let them know
we would; whereupon they crept all together in a huddle close
behind us, as for protection. I left my men drawn up together,
and charging them to hurt nobody, but, if possible, to get at
some or our people, and see what devil it was possessed them,
and what they intended to do, and to command them off; assur-

cost what it would: accordingly, as I came back to my men, I
told them my resolution, and commanded them to follow me;
when at the very moment came four of our men, with the boat-
swain at their head, roving over heaps of bodies they had killed,
all covered with blood and dust, as if they wanted more people
to massacre, when our men hallooed to them as loud as they
could halloo; and with much ado one of them made them hear,
so that they knew who we were, and came up to us.
As soon as the boatswain saw us, he set up a halloo like a
shout of triumph, for having, as he thought, more help come;
and without waiting to hear me, Captain, says he, noble captain!
I am glad 'you are come; we are not half done yet: villanous
hell-hound dogs! I'll kill as many of them as poor Tom has
hairs upon his head: we have sworn to spare none of them;
we’ll root out the very nation of them from the earth: and thus
he ran on, out of breath too with action, and would not give us
leave to speak a word.
At last, raising my voice, that I might silence him a little,
Barbarous dog! said I, what are you doing? I won’t have one
creature touched more, upon pain of death: I charge you upon
your life, to stop your hands, and stand still here, or you are a
dead man this minute.—Why, sir, says he, do you know what
you do, or what they have done? If you want a reason for what
we have done, come hither; and with that he showed me the
poor fellow hanging, with his throat cut.
I confess I was urged then myself, and at another time would
have been forward enough; but I thought they had carried their

wrath, for it was cruel." But I had now a new task upon my
hands; for when thelmen I carried with me saw the sight, as I
had done, I had as much to do to restrain them is I should have
had with the others; nay, my nephew himself fell in with them,
and told me, in their hearing, that he was only concerned for fear
of the men being overpowered; and as to the people, he thought
not one of them ought to live; for they had all glutted themselves
with the murder of the poor man, and that they ought to be
used like murderers: upon these words, away ran eight of my
men, with the boatswain and his crew, to complete their bloody
work; and I, seeing it quite out of my power to restrain them,
came away pensive and sad; for I could not bear the sight, much
less the horrible noise and cries of the poor wretches that fell
into their hands.
I got nobody to come back with me but the supercargo and
two men, and with these walked back to the boat. It was a very
great piece of folly in me, I confess, to venture back as it were
alone; for as it began now to be almost day, and the alarm had
run over the country, there stood about forty men, armed with
lances and bows, at the little place where the twelve or thirteen
houses stood mentioned before; but by accident I missed the
place, and came directly to the seaside; and by the time I got
to the seaside it was broad day; immediately I took the pinnace
and went on board, and sent her back to assist the men in what
might happen.
I observed, about the time that I came to the boat’s side, that
368 ADVENTURES 01'
half an hour after I got on board I heard a volley of our men's
368 ADVENTURES 01'
wards, was our men falling upon the men who, as I said, stood
at the few houses on the way, of whom they killed sixteen or
368 ADVENTURES 01'
the women or children.
By the time the men got to the shore again with the pinnace,
our men began to appear; they came dropping in, not in two
bodies as they went, but straggling here and there in such a
manner, that a small force of resolute men might have cut them
all off. But the dread of them was upon the whole country; and
the men were surprised, and so frightened, that I believe a hun-
368 ADVENTURES 01'
nor in all this terrible action was there a man that made any
considerable defence; they were so surprised between the terror
368 ADVENTURES 01'
368 ADVENTURES 01'
one way they were met by one party; if back again, by another;
so that they were every where knocked down: nor did any of
our men receive the least hurt, except one that sprained his foot,
and another that had one of his hands burned.
I was very angry with my nephew, the captain, and, indeed,
with all the men, in m mind, but with him in particular, as well
for his acting so out 0 his duty, as commander of the ship, and
having the charge of the voyage upon him, as in his prompting,
rather than cooling, the rage of his blind men, in so bloody and
cruel an enterprise. My nephew answered me very respectfully,
but told me that when he saw the body of the poor seaman whom
they had murdered in so cruel and barbarous a manner, he was
not master of himself, neither could he govern his passion: he
owned he should not have done so, as he was commander of the
ship; but as he was a man, and nature moved him, he could not
bear it. As for the rest of the men, they were not subject to
me at all, and they knew it well enough; so they took no notice
of my dislike.
The next day we set sail, so we never heard any more of it.
Our men differed in the account of the number they had killed;
but according to the best of their accounts, put all together, they

women, and children, and left not a house standing in the town.
As for the poor fellow Tom Jeffry, as he was quite dead (for his
throat was so cut that his head was half 05), it would do him no
service to bring him away; so they only took him down from
the tree, where he was hanging by one hand.
However just our men thought this action, I was against them
' in it, and I always after that time told them God would blast the
voyage; for I looked upon all the blood the shed that night to
be murder in them; for though it is true t at they had killed
ROBINION CRUSOE. 359
and had violated or debauched a young woman of theirs, who
came down to them innocently, and on the faith of the public
capitulation.
The boatswain defended this quarrel when we were afterwards
on board. He said it was true that we seemed to break the
truce, but really had not; and that the war was begun the night
before by the natives themselves, who had shot at us, and killed
one of on: men without any just provocation; so that as we

capacity to do ourselves justice upon them in an extraordinary
manner; that though the poor man had taken a little liberty
with the wench, he ought not to have been murdered, and that
in such a villanous manner; and that they did nothing but what
gas just, and what the laws of God allowed to be done to mur-
erers.
One would think this should have been enough to have warned
us against going on shore amongst heathens and barbarians:
but it is im ossible to make mankind wise but at their own
expense; on their experience seems to be always of most use
to them when it is dearest bought.
We were now bound to the gulf of Persia, and from thence to
the coast of Coromandel. only to touch at Surat ; but the chief
of the supercargo's design lay at the bay of Bengal; where if he
. missed his business outward-bound, he was to go up to China,
and return to the coast as he came home.
370 anvnnrunrs or
370 anvnnrunrs or
gulf, were surrounded by the Arabians, and either all killed or
carried away into slavery : the rest of the boat’s crew were not
able to rescue them, and had but just time to get off their boat.
I began to upbraid them with the just retribution of Heaven in
this case; but the boatswain very warm] told me, he thought I
went farther in my censures than I coul show any warrant for
in Scripture; and referred to Luke xiii. 4, where our Saviour
intimates that those men on whom the tower of Siloam fell were
not sinners above all the Galileans; but that which put me to
370 anvnnrunrs or
now lost were of those who went on shore to the massacre of
Madagascar, so I always called it, though our men could not
bear to hear the word massacre with any patience.
But my frequent preaching to them on the subject had worse
consequences than I expected; and the boatswain who had been
the head of the attempt, came up boldly to me one time, and
370 anvnnrunrs or
370 anvnnrunrs or
the men very ill on that account, and himself in particular;
that as I was but a passenger, and had no command in the
ship, or concern in the voyage, they were not obliged to bear
it; that they did not know but I might have some ill design
in my head, and perhaps to them to an account for it
when they came to Envland; and that, therefore, unless I
would resolve to have done with it, and also not to concern
myself any farther with him, or any of his affairs, he would
leave the ship; for he did not think it was safe to sail with me
among them.
I heard him patiently enough till he had done, and then told
him, that I confessed I had all along opposed the massacre of
Madagascar, and that I had, on all occasions, spoken my mind
freely about it, though not more upon him than any of the
rest; that as to having no command in the ship, that was true;
nor did I exercise any authority, only took the liberty of
speaking my mind in things which publicly concerned us all;
and what concern I had in the voyage was none of his business ;
that I was a considerable owner in the ship; in that claim, I
conceived I had a right to speak even farther than I had done,
and would not be accountable to him or any one else; and began
to be a little warm with him. He made but little reply to me
at that time, and I thought the affair had been over. We were
at this time in the road at Bengal; and being willing to see the
place, I went on shore with the supercargo, in the ship’s boat,
to divert myself; and towards evening was preparing to $0 0!!
board, when one of the men came to me, and told me he would
not have me trouble myself to come down to the boat, for they
had orders not to carry me on board any more. Any one may
guess what a surprise I was in at so insolent a message; and
I asked the man who bade him deliver that message to me?
He told me, the cockswain. I said no more to the fellow, but
bade him let them know he had delivered his message, and that
I had given him no answer to it.
I immediately went and found out the supercargo, and told
him the story; adding, which I presently foresaw, that there
would be a mutiny in the ship; and entreated him to go imme-
diately on board the ship in an Indian boat, and acquaint the
captain of it. But I might have spared this intelligence, for
before I had spoken to him on shore the matter was effected on
board. The boatswain, the gunner, the carpenter, and all the
nosmson causoa 37]
and desired to speak with the captain; and there the boatlwain,
making along harangue, and repeating all he had said to me,
told the captain, in a few words, that as I was now gone eace-
abl on shore, they were loath to use any violence wit me,
which, if I had not gone on shore, they would otherwise have
nosmson causoa 37]
tell him, that as they shipped themselves to serve in the ship
under his command, the would perform it well and faithfully;
but if I would not quit the ship, or the captain oblige me to quit
it, they would all leave the ship, and sail no farther with lum;
and at that word all, he turned his face towards the mainmast,
which was, it seems, the signal agreed on between them, at
which all the seamen, being got together there, cried out, One
and all! one and all!
My nephew, the captain, was a man of spirit, and of great
presence of mind; and though he was surprised, you may be
sure, at the thing, yet he told them calmly that he would consi-
der of the matter; but that he could do nothing in it till he had
spoken to me about it. He used some arguments with them
to show them the unreasonableness and injustice of the thing:
but it was all in vain; the swore and shook hands round before
hisface, that they would a 1 go on shore, unless he would engage
to them not to suffer me to come any more on board the ship.
This was a hard article upon him, who knew his obligation
to me, and did not know how I might take it: so he be an to
talk smartly to them ; told them that I was a very consi erahle
owner of the ship, and that, in justice, he could not put me out
of my own house; that this was next door to serving me as the
famous pirate Kidd had done, who made a mutiny in the ship,
let the captain on shore on an uninhabited island, and ran awa
with the ship; that let them go into what ship they would, if
ever they came to England again it would cost them very dear;
that the ship was mine, and that he could not put me out of it
and that he would rather lose the ship and the voyage too than
disoblige me so much ; so they might do as they pleased: how-
ever, he would go on shore and talk with me, and invited the
boatswain to go with him, and perhaps they might accommodate
the matter with me. But they all rejected the proposal, and
said they would have nothing to do with me any more; and if I
came on board, they would all go on shore. Well, said the cap-
tain, if you are all of this mind, let me go on shore and talk with
him. So awa he came to me with this account, a little after the
message had een brought to me from the cockswain.
I was very glad to see my nephew, I must confess; for I was
37 2 ADVENTURES or
lence, set sail, and run away with the ship; and then I had been
stripped naked in a remote country, haviu nothing to help my-
self: in short, I had been in aworse case t an when I was alone
in the island. But they had not come to that length, it seems,
to my satisfaction; and when my nephew told me what they
had said to him, and how they had sworn and shook hands that
the would, one and all, leave the ship if I was suffered to oome
on oard, I told him he should not be concerned at it at all, for
I would stay on shore: I only desired he would take care and
send me all my necessary thinugs on shore, and leave me a suf-
37 2 ADVENTURES or
as I could.
This was a heavy piece of news to my nephew, but there was
no way to help it but to comply; so, in short, he went on board
37 2 ADVENTURES or
to their importunity, and had sent for his goods from on board
the ship : so that the matter was over in a few hours, the men
returned to their duty, and I began to consider what course I
should steer.

had another way before me, which was to wait for some
English ships, which were coming to Bengal from Achin, on the
island of Sumatra, and get passage on board them for England.
But as I came hither without an concern with the English East

out their license, unless with great favour of the captains of
the ships, or the Company’s factors, and to both I was an utter

Indeed, this was next door to it, both Ways; however, my nephew
left me two servants, or rather one companion and one servant;
874 anvamnss or
me, and the other was his own servant. I took me also a
good lodging in the house of an Englishwoman, where several
merchants lodged, some French, two Italians, or rather Jews,
and one Englishman; here I was handsomely enough enter-
tained: and that I might not be said to run rashly upon anything,
I stayed here above nine months considering what course to
take, and how to manage myself. I had some English goods
with me of value, and a considerable sum of money; my nephew
furnishing me with a thousand pieces of eight, and a letter of
credit for more, if I had occasion, that I might not be straitened,
whatever might happen.
I quickly disposed of my goods to advantage, and, as I origi-
nall intended, I bought here some very good diamonds, which,
of a l other things, were the most proper for me, in my present
circumstances; because I could always carry my whole estate
about me.
After along stay here, and many proposals made for my re-
turn to England, but none falling out to my mind, the English
merchant who lodged with me, and whom I had contracted an
intimate acquaintance with, came to me one morning. Country-
man, says he, I have a project to communicate to you, which, as
it suits with my thoughts, may, for aught I know, suit with yours
also, when you shall have thoroughly considered it. Here we
are posted, on by accident, and I by my own choice, in a part
of the world, very remote from our own country; but it is in a
country where, by us who understand trade and business, a great
deal of money is to be got. If you will put one thousand pounds
874 anvamnss or
we can get to our minds; you shall be captain, I'll be merchant,
and we’ll go a trading voyage to China : for what should we stand
still for? The whole world is in motion, rolling round and
round; all the creatures of God, heavenly bodies and earthly,
are busy and diligent: why should we be idle? There are no
drones in the world but men; why should we be of that number?
I liked this proposal very well, and the more because it seemed
to be eXpressed with so much good will, and in so friendly a
manner. I will not say but that I might, by my loose unhinged
874 anvamnss or
indeed any thing else; whereas, otherwiSe, trade was none of
my element. However, I might perhaps say with some truth,
that if trade was not my element, rambling was, and no pro-
pgsal for seeing any part of the world which I had never seen
fore could possibly come amiss to me.
It was, however, some time before we could get a ship to our
minds, and when we had got a vessel, it was not easy to get
English sailors; that is to say, so many as were necessary to
govern the voyage and manage the sailors which we should pick
up there. After some time we got a mate, a boatswain, and a
gunner, English; a Dutch carpenter, and three foremastmen.
With these we found we could do well enough, having Indian
seamen, such as they were, to make up.
There are so many travellers who have wrote the history of
their voyages and travels this way, that it would be very little
diversion to any body to give a long account of the places we
went to, and the people who inhabit there: these things I leave
to others, and refer the reader to those journals and travels of

get such very great estates as the do, and sometimes come home
worth sixty or seventy thousan pounds at a time; but it is no
wonder, or at least we shall see so much farther into it, when we
consider the innumerable ports and places where they have a
free commerce, that it will be none; and much less will it be so
when we consider that at those places and ports where the
English ships come, there is such great and constant demands for
the growth of all other countries, that there is a certain vent for
the returns, as well as a market abroad for the goods carried out.
In short, we made a very good voyage, and I got so much

method of getting more, that had I been twenty years younger,
I should have been tempted to have stayed here, and sought no
farther for making any fortune : but what was all this to a man
upwards of threescore, that was rich enough, and came abroad
more in obedience to a restless desire of seeing the world than a
covetous desire of gaining by it? And, indeed, I think it is with
great justice I now call it restless desire, for it was so. When
I was at home, I was restless to go abroad; and when I was
abroad, I was restless to be at home. I say, what was this gain
to me'! I was rich enough already, nor had I any uneasy desires

voyage to me was of no great force for the prompting me forward
to farther undertakings; hence I thought that by this voyage I
had made no progress at all, because I was come back, as I might
call it, to the place from whence I came, as to a home: whereas
my e e, which, like that which Solomon speaks of, was new
latis ed with seeing, was still desirous of wandering and seeing
more. I was come into a part of the world which I was never
in before, and that apart, in particular, which I had heard much
of, and was resolv to see as much of it as I could; and then I
thought I might say I had seen all the world that was worth
seem .
Bug my fellow traveller and I had different notions: I do not
name this to insist on my own, for I acknowledge his were the
most just, and the most suited to the end of a merchant’s life;
who, when he is abroad upon adventures, it is his wisdom to
stick to that, as the best thing for him, which he is like to get

never cares to see a thing twice over. But this was not all: I
had a kind of impatience upon me to be nearer home, and yet
the most unsettled resolution imaginable which way to go. In
the interval of these consultations, my friend, who was always
upon the search for business, proposed another voyage to me
among the Spice Islands, and to bring home a loading of cloves
from the Manillas, or thereabouts; places, indeed, where the
Dutch trade, but islands belonging partly to the Spaniards;

My friend, when we made up this account, smiled at me:
Well now, said he, with a sort of agreeable insult upon my
indolent temper, is not this better than walking about here, like
a man of nothing to do, and spending our time in staring at the
nonsense and ignorance of the Pagans T—Why, truly, says 1, my
friend, I think it is, and I begin to be a convert to the principles
of merchandising; but I must tell you, said I, by the way, you
do not know what I am doing; for if I once conquer my back-
wardness, and embark heartily, as old as I am, Ishall harass
you up and down the world till I tire you; for I shall pursue it
so eagerly, I shall never let you lie still.
But, to be short with my speculations, a little while after this
there came in a Dutch ship from Batavia; she was a coaster-
not an European trader, of about two hundred tons burthen; the
men, as they pretended, having been so sickly, that the captain
had not hands enough to go to sea with, he lay by at Bengal;
and having, it seems, got moneyl enough, or being willing, for
other reasons, to go for Europe, e gave public notice he would
sell his ship. This came to my ears before my new partner heard
of it, and I had a great mind to buy it; so I went to him, and
told him of it. He considered awhile, for he was no rash man
neither; but musing some time, he replied, She is a little too
big; but, however, we will have her. Accordingly, we bought
the ship, and agreeing with the master, we paid for her, and took
possession. When we had done so, we resolved to entertain the
men, if we could, to join them with those we had, for the pur-
suing our business; but on a sudden, they having received, not
their wages, but their share of the money, as we afterwards
learned, not one of them was to be found; we in uired much
about them, and at length were told that they were a one toge-
ther b land to Agra, the great cit of the Mogul’s resi ence, and
from t ence to travel to Surat, an go by sea to the gulf of Persia.
Nothing had so much troubled me a good while as that I should
miss the opportunity of going with them; for such a ramble, I
thought, and in such company as would both have guarded and
diverted me, would have suited mightily with my great design;
andI should have both seen the world and gone homewards too:

know what sort of fellows they were; for, in short, their history
was, that this man they called captain was the gunner only, not
the commander; that they had been a trading voyage, in which
they had been attacked on shore by some of the Malays, who had
killed the captain and three of his men ; and that after the captain
was killed, these men, eleven in number, had resolved to run
away with the ship, which they did, and brought her to Bengal,
nonmsou canon. 87 7
Well, let them get the ship how they would, we came honestly
by her, as we thought, though we did not, I confess, examine
into things so exactly as we ought; for we never inquired any-
thing of the seamen, who would certainly have faltered in their
account, contradicted one another, and perhaps contradictal
themselves; or one how or other we should have had reason to
have suspected them: but the man showed us a bill of sale for
the ship, to one Emanuel Clostershoven, or some such name, for
I suppose it was all a forgery, and called himself by that name,
and we could not contradict him; and withal, having no‘suse
pinion of the thing, we went through with our bargain.

some Dutch; and now we resolved for a second voyage to the

I did, directed the captain to put into the river of Cambodia; for
I had made the English mate, one Mr. Thompson, captain, not
being willing to take the charge of the ship upon myself. This
river lies on the north side of the great bay or gulf which goes
up to Siam. While we were here, and going often on shore for
refreshment, there comes to me one day an Englishman, and he
was, it seems, a gunner's-mate on board an English East India
shi which rode in the same river, at or near the city of Cam—

At it, for I could not conceive what he meant; and I turned short
upon him, and said, Sir, I wish you would explain yourself;

have met with a better reception than this, for doing you a
piece of service of such importance.-—I can never be ungrateful,
said I, for any service, or to any man that offers me any kind-
ness; but it is past my comprehension what they should have
such a design upon me for: however, since you say there is no
time to be lost, and that there is some villanous design on hand
against me, I will go on board this minute, and put to sea
immediately, if my men can stop the leak, or if we can swim
without stopping it: but, sir, said I, shall I go away ignorant
of the cause of all this? Can you give me no further light into
it '.'—I can tell you but part of the story, sir, says he ; but I have

pirates. This is the sum of the story, and you will all be seized
as pirates, I can assure you, and executed with very little cere-
mony; for you know merchant ships show but little law to
pirates, if they get them into their power.—Now you speak
plain English, said I, and I thank you; and though I know
nothing that we have done like what you talk of, for I am sure
we came honestly and fairly by the ship; yet seeing such a work
is doing, as you say, and that you seem to mean honestly, I will
be upon my guard—Nay, sir, says he, do not talk about being
upon your guard; the best defence is, to be out of the danger;
if you have any regard for your life, and the lives of all your
men, put to sea, without fail, at high water; and as you have a

I consented to this readily, and went immediately on board,
and the two men with me. As soon as I came to the ship’s
side, my artner, who was on board, came out on the quarter-
deek, an called to me, with a great deal of joy, 0 ho! 0 ho ! we

got up ; and though the tide was not quite down, yet a little land
breeze blowing, we stood out to sea. Then I called him into the
cabin, and told him the story ; and we called in the men, and they
told us the rest of it: but as it took up a great deal of time,

' is something in it. In the next place I ordered all our men to
be called up, and told them there was a design to seize the ship,
and to take us for pirates, and asked them if they would stand
by us, and by one another: the men answered cheerfully, one
and all, that they would live and die with us. Then I asked the

them ; for resist them I was resolved we would, and that to the
last drop. He said readily that the way was to keep them

neither of these would do any longer, we should retire to our

Being thus elivered from a danger, which, though I knew not
the reason of it, (yet seemed to be much greater than I appre—

let any one know whither we were going: so we stood out to
sea. eastward, quite out of the course of all European shi s,
whether the were bound to China or any where else within t e
commerce 0 the European nations.
When we were at sea, we began to consult with the two sea-
men, and inquire what the meaning of all this should be; and
the Dutchman let us into the secret at once, telling us that the
fellow that sold us the ship, as we said, was no more than a thief
that had run away with her. Then he told us how the captain,
whose name too he told us, though I do not remember it now,
was treacherously murdered by the natives on the coast of Ms-
lacca, with three of his men; and that he, this Dutchman, and
four more, got into the woods, where they wandered about a
great while, till at length he, in particular, in a miraculous
manner, made his escape, and swam Oh" to a Dutch shi , which.
sailing near the shore in its way from China, had sent t eir boat
on shore for fresh water; that he durst not come to that part of
the shore where the boat was, but made shift in the night to
take the water farther off, and swimming a great while, at last
the ship’s boat took him up.
He then told us that he went to Batavia, where two of the
seamen belonging to the ship arrived, having deserted the rest
in their travels, and gave an account that the fellow who had
run away with the ship sold her at Bengal to a set of pirates,
which were gone a cruising in her; and that they had already
taken an English ship and two Dutch ships very richl laden.
This latter part was found to concern us directly, though we
knew it to be false; et as m partner said very justly, if we had
fallen into their han s, and t ey had had such a prepossession
against us beforehand, it had been in vain for us to have defended
ourselves, or to hope for any good quarter at their hands; and
especially considering that our accusers had been our judges, and
that we could have expected nothing from them but what rage
would have dictated, and an ungoverned passion have executed;
and therefore it was his opinion we should go dll'8( tly back to
Bengal, from whence we came, without putting in at any port
whatever; because there we could give a good account of our-
selves, could prove where we were when the ship put in, oi
whom we bought her, and the like; and which was more than
all the rest. if we were put upon the necessity of bringing it
before the proper judges, we should be sure to have some justice,
nonmsou causes. 383
[was some time of my partner’s opinion; but after a little
more serious thinking, I told him I thought it was a very great
hazard for us to attempt returning to Bengal, for that we were
on the wrong side of the Straits of Malacca, and that if the
alarm was given, we should be sure to be waylaid on every side,
as well by the Dutch of Batavia as the English elsewhere; that -
if we should be taken, as it were, running away, we should even
condemn ourselves, and there would want no more evidence to
destroy us. I also asked the English sailor’s opinion, who said
he was of my mind, and that we should certainly be taken.
This danger a little startled my artner, and all the ship's com-
pany, and we immediately reso ved to go away to the coast of
Tonquin, and so on to the coast of China; and pursuing the

seemed to be more steadily against us, blowing almost trade,
as we call it, from the E. and E.N.E., so that we were a long
while upon our voyage, and we were but ill provided with vic-
tuals for so long a run; and, which was still worse, there was
some danger that those English and Dutch ships, whose boats
pursued us, whereof some were bound that way, might be got in
efore us, and if not, some other ship bound to China might
have information of us from them, and pursue us with the same
vigour.
I must confess, I was now very uneasy, and thought myself,
including the late escape from the longboats, to have been in
the most dangerous condition that ever I was through my past
life; for whatever ill circumstances I had been in, I was never
pursued for a thief before; nor had 1 ever done anything that
merited the name of dishonest or fraudulent, much less thievish;
I had chielly been my own enemy, or, as I may rightly say, I
had been nobody’s enemy but my own; but now I was embar-
rassed in the worst condition imaginable; for though I was
perfectly innocent, I was in no condition to make that innocence
appear; and if I had been taken, it had been under a supposed
guilt of the worst kind. This made me very anxious to make
an escape, though which way to do it I knew not, or what port
or place we could go to. My partner seein me thus dejected,

me, and describing to me the several ports of that coast, told
me he Would put in on the coast of Cochin China, or the bay
of Tonquin, intending to go afterwards to Macac, a to an once
in possession of the Portuguese, and where still a great many
European families resided; and articularly the missionary
priests usually went thither, in 0 er to their going forward to
China.
Hither then we resolved to go; and accordingly, though after
a tedious and irregular course, and very much straitened for
provisions, we came within sight of the coast very early in the
$84 ADVENTURE or
were in, and the danger if we had not escaped. we resolved to
put into a small river, which, however, had depth enough of
water for us, and to see if we could, either overland or by the
ship’s pinnace, come to know what ships were in any port
thereabouts. This happy step was, indeed, our deliverance;
for though we did not immediately see any European ships in
the bay of Tonquin, yet the next morning there came into the
bay two Dutch ships; and a third, without any colours spread
out, but which we believed to be a Dutchman, passed by at
about two leagues’ distance, steering for the coast of China; and
in the afternoon went by two English ships steering the same
course; and thus we thought we saw ourselves beset with
enemies both one way and the other. The place we were in was
wild and barbarous; the people thieves, even by occupation or
profession; and though, it is true, we had not much to seek of
them, and, except getting a few provisions, cared not how little

we kept ourselves from being insulted by them, several ways.
\Ve were in a small river of this country, within a few leagues
of its utmost limits northward; and by our boat we coasted
north-east, to the point of land which opens the great bay of
Tonquin; and it was in this beating up along the shore that we
discovered we were surrounded with enemies. The people we
were among were the most barbarous of all the inhabitants of
the coast, having no correspondence with any other nation, and

may be particularly seen that they are the most barbarous of
any of the inhabitants. Among other customs, they have this
one, viz. that if any vessel has the misfortune to be shipwrecked
upon their coast, they presently make the men all prisoners or
slaves; and it was not long before we found a piece of their
kindness this way, on the occasion following.
I have observed above, that our ship sprung a leak at sea,

out where the leaks were. Accordingly, having lightened the
ship, and brought all our guns and other moveables to one side,
‘we tried to bring her down, that we might come at her bottom ;
but, on second thoughtsqwe did not care to lay her on dry
aoamson causes. 885
The inhabitants, who had never been acquainted with such a
sight, came wandering down the shore to look at us; and seeing
the ship lie down on one side in such a manner,_and heeling in
towards the shore, and not seeing our men, who new at work
on her bottom with stages, and with their boats, on the off-side,
they presently concluded that the ship was cast awn y, and lay so
fast on the ground. On this supposition, they all came about
us in two or three hours’ time, with ten or twelve large boats,
having some of them eight, some ten men in a boat, intending,
no doubt, to have come on board and plundered the ship; and
if they had found us there, to have carried us away for slaves to
their king, or whatever they call him, for we knew nothing of
their governor.
When they came up to the ship and began to row round her,
they discovered us all hard at work on the outside of the ship's
bottom and side, washing, and graving, and stopping, as every
seafaring man knows how. They stood for a while gazing at us,
and we, who were a little surprised, could not imagine what
their design was; but being willing to be sure, we took this
opportunity to get some of us into the ship, and others to hand
down arms and ammunition to those that were at work to defend
themselves with, if there should be occasion; and it was no
more than need: for in less than a quarter of an hour's consul-
tation, they agreed, it seems, that the ship was really a wreck;
and that we were all at work endeavouring to save her, or to
save our lives by the help of our boats; and when we handed
our arms into the boats, they concluded, by that motion, that we
were endeavouring to save some of our goods; upon this they
took it for granted we all belonged to them, and away they came
directly upon our men, as if it had been in a line of battle.
Our men, seeing so many of them, began to be frightened, for

what they should do. I immediately called to the men that
worked upon the stages, to slip them down, and get up the side
into the ship; and bade those in the boat to row round, and
come on board; and those few of us who were on board worked
with all the strength and hands we had, to bring the ship to
rights; but, however, neither the men upon the stages norr those
in the boats could do as they were ordered, before the Cochin
Chinese were upon them; and two of their boats boarded our
longboat, and began to lay hold on the men as their prisoners.

died in his hands; and, in the mean time, a Dutchman,who stood

such stuff as the shipwrights use for that work; and the man
that attended the carpenter had a great iron ladle in his hand,
with which he supplied the men that were at work with the hot
stuff: two of the enemy's men entered the boat just where this
fellow stood. being in the fore-sheets; he immediately saluted
them with a ladleful of the stuff, boiling hot, which so burned and
scalded them, being half naked, that they roared out like bulls,

saw it, and cried out, Well done, Jack! give them some more of

dipping it in the pitch-pot, he and his man threw it among them
so plentifully, that, in short, of all the men in the three boats
there was not one that escaped being scalded and burned with
it, in a most frightful, pitiful manner, and made such a howling
and crying, that I never heard a worse noise: for it is worth
observing, that though pain naturally makes all people cry
out, yet every nation has a particular way of exclamation, and
makes noises as different from one another as their speech. I
cannot give the noise these creatures made a better name than
howling, nor a name more proper to the tone of it; for I never
heard anything more like the noise of the wolves, which, as I
have said, I heard howl in the forest on the frontiers of Lan-
guedoc.
I was never better pleased with a victory in in life; not only
as it was a perfect surprise to me, and that our ngcr was im-
minent before, but, as we got this victory without any blood-
shed, except of that man the fellow killed with his naked hands,
and which I was very much concerned at, for I was sick of kill-
ing such poor savage wretches, even though it was in my ona
defence, knowing they came on errands which they thought just

to be killing our fellow-creatures to preserve ourselves; and.

the value of life would be of my opinion, if they entered seriously
into the consideration of it. .
But to return to my story :—All the while this was doing, my
partner and I, who managed the rest of the men on board, had
with great dexterity brought the ship almost to rights, and
having got the guns into their places again, the gunner called

doubt but we should be surrounded the next day with rogues
enough, perhaps more than our pitch-kettle would dispose of
for us. We therefore got all our things on board the same
evening, and the next morning were ready to sail: in the mean
time, lying at anchor at some distance from the shore, we were

have gone into the bay of Tonquin, for we wanted to inform
ourselves of what was to be known concerning the Dutch ships
that had been there; but we durst not stand in there, because
we had seen several ships go in, as we supposed, but a little
before: so we kept on N. E. towards the island of Formosa, as
much afraid of being seen b a Dutch or English merchant ship,
as a Dutch or English merc ant ship in the Mediterranean is of
an Algerine man-of-war.
When we were thus got to sea, we kept on N. E. as if we
would go to the Manillas or the Philippine islands, and this we
did that we might not fall into the we of any of the European
ships; and then we steered north, til we came to the latitude
of 22 deg 30 min., by which means we made the island Formosa
directly, where we came to an anchor, in order to get water and 3
fresh provisions, which the people there, who were very cour- -'
teens and civil in their manners, supplied us with willii gly, and 2-

From thence we sailed still north, keeping the coast of China
at an equal distance, till we knew we were beyond all the ports
of China where our European ships usually come; being resolved,
if possible, not to fall into any of their hands, especially in this
country; where, as our circumstances were, we could not fail of
being entirely ruined.
Being now come to the latitude of thirty degrees, we resolved

ing in for the shore, a boat came off two leagues to us, with an
old Portuguese pilot on board, who knowing us to be an Euro-
pean ship, came to offer his service, which, indeed, we were glad
of, and took him on board; upon which, without asking us
whither we would go, he dismissed the boat he came in, and
sent it back.
I thought it was now so much in our choice to make the old
man carry us whither we would, that I began to talk to him
about carrying us to the gulf of Nanquin, which is the most
northern part of the coast of China. The old man said he knew
the gulf of Nanquin very well, but smiling, asked us what we
would do there? I told him we would sell our cargo and pur-
chase China wares, calicoes, raw silks, tea, wrought silks, &c.,
and so would return by the same course we came. He told us
our best port had been to have put in at Macao, where we could
not have failed of a market for our opium to our satisfaction,
and might for our money have purchased all sorts of China
goods as cheap as we could at Nanquin.
Not being able to put the old man out of his talk, of which
he was very opinionated or conceited, I told him we were gen-
tlemen as well as merchants, and that we had a mind to go and
see the great city of Peking, and the famous court of the monarch
of China. Why then, says the old man, you should go to Ning'po,
where, by the river which runs into the sea there, you may go

Well, said I, Senhor Portuguese, but that ls not our business
now; the great question is, if you can carry us up to the city or
Nan uin, from whence we can travel to Peking afterwards? He
said e could do so very well, and that there was a great Dutch
ship gone up that way just before. This gave me a little shock,
for a Dutch ship was now our terror, and we had much rather

The old man found me a little confused, and under some con-

need be under no apprehensions of the Dutch; I su pose t ey

with peaceable merchants, sure.

said I, it is true, I am a little unsettled in my resolution at this
time, whither to go in particular; and I am something more so
for what you said about pirates. I hope there are no pirates in
these seas; we are but in an ill condition to meet with them,
for you see we have but a small force, and are but very weakly
manned—O, sir, says he, don’t be concerned, I do not know

except one, which was seen, as I hear, in the bay of Siam, about

she was not built for a privateer, but was run away with by a
reprobate crew that was on board, after the captain and some
of his men had been murdered by the Malayans, at or near the
island of Sumatra.—-What! said I, seeming to know nothing of
the matter, did they murder the captain ’!-—No, said he, I don’t
understand that they murdered him; but as they afterwards ran
away with the ship, it is generally believed that they betrayed
him into the hands of the Malayans, who did murder him; and
serhaps the procured them to do it.—Why then, said 1, they
eserve deat as much as if they had done it themselves—Na ,
lays the old man, they do deserve it; and they will certai y
have it, if they light upon any English or Dutch ship; for the
have all agreed together, that if they meet that rogue they’
give him no quarter.—But, said I to him, you say the pirate is
gone out of these seas; how can they meet with him then?—
Why, that’s true, says he, the do say so; but he was, as I tell
you, in the bay of Siam, in t e river Cambodia; and was dis-
covered there by some Dutchmen who belonged to the ship, and
who were left on shore when they ran away with her; and some
English and Dutch traders being in the river, they were within
a little of taking him: nay, said he, if the foremost boats had
been well seconded by the rest, they had certainly taken him;

pilot, there is no need to make a formal business of it with such
rogues as those; let them tie them back to back, and set them
a diving, 'tis no more than they deserve.
I knew I had in old man fast on board, and that he could do
no harm, so that turned short upon him: Well now, senhor,
said I, this is the very reason why I would have you carry us
up to Nanquin, and not put back to Macao, or to any other part
of the country where the English or Dutch ships come; for be
it known to you, senhor, those captains of the English and
Dutch ships are a parcel of rash, proud, insolent fellows, that
neither know what belongs to justice, nor how to behave them-
selves as the laws of God and nature direct; but being proud of

the murderers to punish robbers ; would take upon them to
insult men falsely accused, and determine them guilty without
due inquiry: and perhaps I ma live to bring some of them to
account for it, when they may he taught how justice is to be
executed; and that no man ought to be treated as a criminal till
some evidence may be had of the crime, and that he is the man.
With this I told him that this was the ver ship they attacked,
and gave him a full account of the skirmis we had with their
boats, and how foolishly and cowardly they behaved. I told
him all the story of our buying the ship, and how the Dutchman
served us. I told him the reasons I had to believe the story
of killing the master by the Malayans was true, as also the

to suggest that the men had turned pirates, and they ought to
have been sure it was so before they had ventured to attack us
by surprise, and oblige us to resist them; adding, that they would
have the blood of those men, whom we killed there in just do-
fence, to answer for.
The old man was amazed at this relation, and told us we were
very much in the right to go away to the north; and that if he
might advise us, it should be to sell the ship in China, which we
might very well do, and buy or build another in the country;
and, said he, though you will not get so good a ship, yet you may
get one able enough to carry you and all your goods back again
to Bengal, or any where else. I told him I would take his

meet with customers enough for the ship at Nunquin, and that
a Chinese junk would serve me very well to go back again ; and
that he would procure me people both to bu one and sell the
other. Well but, senhor, said I, as you say t ey know the ship
so well, I may, perhaps, if I follow your measures, be instru-
mental to bring some honest innocent men into a terrible broil,
and perhaps to be murdered in cold blood; for wherever they

way to prevent that also ; for as I know all those commanders you

that they had been so much in the wrong; that though the

suaded they will so far believe me, as at least to act more cau-
tiously for the time to come.
While these things were passing between us, by way of dis-
course, we went forward directly for Nanquin, and in about
thirteen days’ sail came to an anchor at the south-west point
of the great gulf ot' Nanquin; where, by the way, I came b
accident to understand that two Dutch ships were gone the length
before me, and that I should certainly fall into their hands.
I consulted my partner again in this exigenc , and he was as
much at a loss as I was, and would ver g1 y have been safe
on shore almost any where: however, I was not in such per-
plexity neither, but I asked the old pilot if there was no creek
or harbour which I might put into and pursue my business with
the Chinese privatel , and be in no danger of the enemy. He
told me, if I woul sail to the southward about forty-two
leagues, there was a little port called Quinchang, where the
fathers of the mission usually landed from Macao, on their pro-
gress to teach the Christian religion to the Chinese, and when
no European ships ever put in; and if I thought to put in there,
I might consider what further course to take when Iwas on
shore. He confessed, he said, it was not a. place for merchants,
except that at some certain times they had a kind of a fair there,
when the merchants from Japan came over thither to buy the
Chinese merchandises.
We all agreed to go back to this place; the name of the port, as
he called it, I may perhaps spell wrong, for I do not particularly
remember it, having lost this, together with the names of many
other places set down in a little pocket-book, which was spoiled
‘by the water by an accident; but this I remember, that the
Chinese or Japanese merchants we corresponded with called it
by a different name from that which our Portuguese pilot gave
it, and pronounced it as above, Quinchang
As we were unanimous in our resolution to go to this place,
we weighed the next day, having only gone twice on shore
where we were to get fresh water; on both which occasions the
people of the country were very civil to us, and brought us abund-
ance of things to sell to us, I mean of provisions, plants, roots,
tea. rice, and some fowls, but nothing without money.
We came to the other port (the wind being contrary) not till
a” ADVENTURES 01?1
joyful, and I may say thankful, when I set my foot on shore,
resolving, and my partner too, that if it was possible to dispose
a” ADVENTURES 01?1
satisfaction, we would never set one foot on board that unhappy
vessel more; and, indeed, I must acknowledge, that of all the cir-
cumstances of life that ever I had any experience of, nothing
makes mankind so completely miserable as that of being in con-
stant fear. Well does the Scripture say, “ The fear of man brings
a snare;" it is a life of death, and the mind is so entirely op-
pressed by it, that it is capable of no relief.
Nor did it fail of its usual operations upon the fancy, by
heightening every danger, representing the English and Dutch
captains to be men incapable of hearing reason, or of distins
guishing between honest men and rogues; or between a story
calculated for our own turn, made out of nothing, on purpose
to deceive, and a true genuine account of our whole voyage, pro-
gress, and design; for we might many ways have convinced any
reasonable creature that we were not pirates ; the goods we had
on board, the course we steered, our frankly showing ourselves,
and entering into such and such ports; and even our very man-
nor, the force we had, the number of men, the few arms, little
ammunition, short provisions; all these would have served to
convince any men that we were no pirates. The opium and
other goods we had on board would make it appear the ship
had been at Bengal. The Dutchmen, who, it was said, had the
Mines of all the men that werein the ship, might easily see that
we were a mixture of English, Portuguese. and Indians, and but
two Dutchmen on board. These, and many other particular
zircnmstances, might have made it evident to the understanding
of any commander, whose ha'nds we might fall into, that we
were no pirates. But fear, that blind, useless passion, worked
another way, and threw us into the vapours; it bewildered our
understandings, and set the imagination at work to form a thou-

supposed, as indeed every bod};y else had related to us, that the
seamen on board the English and Dutch ships, but especially
the Dutch, were so enraged at the name of a pirate, and espe-

often said, I know not but I should have been apt to have taken
those circumstances for evidence, if the tables were turned, and
my case was theirs ; and have made no scruple of cutting all the
crew to pieces, without believing, or perhaps considering, what
they might have to offer in their defence.
But let that be how it will, these were our apprehensions;
and both my partner and I scarce slept a night without dream-

out of my sleep.
Another apprehension I had was, the cruel usage we might
meet with from them if we fell into their hands: then the story
of Amboyna came into my head, and how the Dutch might per-
haps torture us, as they did our countrymen there, and make
some of our men, by extremity of torture, confess those crimes
they never were guilty of, or own themselves and all of us to be
pirates, and so they would put us to death with a formal appear-
ance of justice; and that they might be tempted to do this for

thousand pounds, put all together,
These things tormented me and my partner too, night and day;
nor did we consider that the captains of ships have no authority
to act thus; and if we had surrendered prisoners to them, they
could not answer the destroying us, or torturing us, but would
be accountable for it when they came to their own country; this,
I say, gave me no satisfaction ; for if they were to act thus with
us, what advantage would it be to us that they should be called

upon the vast variety of my particular circumstances; how hard
I thought it was, that I, who had spent forty years in a life of
89‘ ADVENTURES 0'
port or haven which all men drive at, viz. to have rest and plenty,
should be a. volunteer in new sorrows by my own unhappy
choice; and that I, who had escaped so many dangers in my
youth, should now come to be hanged in my old age, and in so
remote a place, for a crime which I was not in the least inclined
to, much less guilty of.
After these thoughts, something of religion would come in;
and I would be considering that this seemed to me to be a dis-
position of immediate Providence, and I ought to look upon it
and submit to it as such; that although I was innocent as to
men, I was far from being innocent as to my Maker; and Iought
to look in and examine what other crimes in in life were most
89‘ ADVENTURES 0'
punishment as a retribution; and that I ought to submit to
this, just as I would to a shipwreck, if it had pleased God to
have brought such a disaster upon me.
In its turn, natural courage would sometimes take its place,
and then I would be talking in self up to vigorous resolutions;
that I would not be taken to e barbarously used by a parcel
of merciless wretches in cold blood; that it were much better
to have fallen into the hands of the save. es, though I was sure
they would feast upon me when they h taken me, than those
who would perhaps glut their rage upon me by inhuman tor-
tures and barbarities; that in the case of the savages I always
89‘ ADVENTURES 0'
do so now, seeing it was much more dreadful, to me at least, to
think of falling into these men’s hands, than ever it was to
think of being eaten by men? for the savages, give them their
due, would not eat a man till he was killed and dead, but that
these men had many arts beyond the cruelty of death. When-
ever these thoughts prevailed, I was sure to ut myself into a

Would boil, and my eyes sparkle, as if Iwas engage , andl
always resolved to take no onarter at their hands; but, even
It last, if I could resist no longer, I would blow up the ship
and all that was in her, and leave them but little booty to
boast of.
The greater weight the anxieties and perplexities of these
things were to our thoughts while we were at sea, the greater
was our satisfaction when we saw ourselves on shore; and my
artner told me he dreamed that he had a very heavy load upon
his back, which he was to carry up a hill, and found that he was
not able to stand longer under it; but that the Portuguese pilot
came and took it off his back, and the hill disappeared, the
ground before him appearing all smooth and plain: and truly it
was so; they were all like men who had a load taken off their
backs. For my part, I had a weight taken off from my heart
that it was not able any longer to bear; and, as I said above, we'
resolved to go no more to sea in that ship. When we came on
shore, the old pilot, who was now our friend, got us a lodgin
and a warehouse for our goods, which, by the way, was muc
the same: it was a. little house, or hut, with a larger house ad~
joining to it, all built with canes, and palisadoed round with large
canes, to keep out pilfering thieves, of which, it seems, there were
not a few in that country: however, the magistrates allowed us
a little guard, and we had a soldier with a kind of halberd, or
half-pike, who stood sentinel at our door; to whom we allowed
a pint of rice, and a little piece of money, about the value of three-
pence, per day, so that our goods were kept very safe.
The fair, or mart, usually kept in this place, had been over
some time; however, we found that there were three or four
junks in the river, and two J apaners, I mean ships from Japan,
with goods which they had bought in China, and were not gone
away, having some Japanese merchants on shore.

us acquainted with three missionary Romish priests who were
in town, and who had been there some time converting the people
to Christianity; but we thought they made but poor work of it,
and made them but sorry Christians when they had done: how-
ever, that was none of our business. One of these was a French-
man, whom they called Father Simon ; another was a Portuguese,
and the third, a Genoese; but Father Simon was courteous, easy
in his manner, and very agreeable company; the other two were
more reserved, seemed rigid and austere, and ap lied seriously to
the work they came about, viz. to talk with, an insinuate them-
selves among, the inhabitants, wherever they had opportunity.
We often ate and drank with those men; and though, I must
confess, the conversion, as they call it, of the Chinese to Christi-
anity is so far from the true conversion required to bring heathen
people to the faith of Christ, that it seems to amount to little
more than letting them know the name of Christ, and say some
prayers to the Virgin Mary and her Son, in a tongue which they

not only the fatigue of the voyave, and the hazards of living in

tortures, for the sake of this work.
But to return to my story. This French priest, Father Simon,
was appointed, it seems, by order of the chief of the mission, to
go up to Peking, the royal seat of the Chinese emperor, and
waited only for another priest, who was ordered to come to him
from Macao, to go along with him; and we scarce ever met
together but he was inviting me to go that journey; telling me
how he would show me all the glorious things of that mighty
empire, and, among the rest, the greatest city in the worl : a
city, said he, that your London and our Paris put together,
cannot be equal to. This was the city of Peking, which, I con-

396 ADVENTURE or
one day, and being very merry together, I showed some little
inclination to go with him; and he pressed me and my partner
very hard, and with a great many persuasions, to consent. Why,
Father Simon, says my partner, should you desire our company
so much? you know we are heretics, and you do not love us,
nor cannot keep us company with any pleasure—O, says he,
you may perhaps be good cat olics in time; my business here is
to convert heathens, and who knows but 1 may convert you too!
--Very well, Father, said I, so you will preach to us all the way?
—I will not be troublesome to you, says he; our religion does
not divest us of good manners: besides, we are here like country-
men; and so we are, compared to the place we are in; and if you
are Huguenots, and I a Catholic, we may all be Christians at
last; at least, we are all gentlemen, and we may converse so,
without being uneasy to one another. I liked this part of his
discourse very well, and it began to put me in mind of my priest
that I had left in the Brazils; but this Father Simon did not come
up to his character by a great deal: for though Father Simon had
no appearance of a criminal levity in him neither, yet he had
not that fund of Christian zeal, strict piety, and sincere affection
to religion, that my other good ecclesiastic had.

to venture to sail for the river of Kilam, and the city of Nan-
quin: but Providence seemed now more visibly, as I thought,
than ever, to concern itself in our affairs; and I was encouraged,
from this very time, to think I should one way or other get out
of this entangled circumstance, and be brought home to my own
country again, though I had not the least view of the manner.

missionary priests for his interpreter, and told me he had a pro—
posal to make to me, which was this :—he had bought a great
quantity of goods of us, when he had no thoughts of proposals
made to him of buying the ship ; and that, therefore, he had not
money enough to pay for the ship 5 but if I would let the same
men who were in the ship navigate her, he would hire the ship
' to go to Japan; and would send them from thence to the Philip-
pine islands with another loading, which he would pay the
freight of before they went from Japan, and that at their return
he would buy the ship. I began to listen to his proposal, and
so eager did my head still run upon rambling, that I could not
but begin to entertain a notion of going myself with him, and so
to sail from the Philippine islands away to the South Seas :
accordingly I asked the Japanese merchant if he would not hire
us to the Philippine islands, and discharge us there. He said,
N 0, he could not do that, for then he could not have the return
of his cargo; but he would discharge us in Japan, at the ship’s
return. Well, still I was for taking him at that proposal, and
going myself; but my partner, wiser than myself, persuaded me
from it, representing the dangers, as well of the seas as of the
Japanese, who are a false, cruel, and treacherous people; like-
wise those of the Spaniards at the Philippines, more false, cruel,
and treacherous than they.

was there and alive, he would render me a faithful account of kin
success, which should be as much mine as I pleased. I was
really 10th to part with him; but considering the prospect of
advantage, which was really considerable, and that he was a
young fellow as likely to do well in it as any I knew, I inclined
to let him go; but I told him I would consult my partner, and
give him an answer the next day. My partner and I discoursed
about it, and my partner made a most generous offer: You know
it has been an unlucky ship, said he, and we both resolve not to
go to sea in it again: if our steward (so he called my man) will
venture the voyage, I w' 1 leave my share of the vessel to him,
and let him make the best of it; and if we live to meet in England,
and he meets with success abroad, he shall account for one half
398 ADVENTURE! or
If my partner, who was no way concerned with my young
398 ADVENTURE! or
the same: and all the ship’s compan being willing to go with
him, we made over half the ship to him in property, and took
a writing from him, obliging him to account for the other; and
away he went to Japan. The Japan merchant proved a very
punctual, honest man to him; protected him at Japan, and got
him a licence to come on shore, which the Europeans in general
have not lately obtained; paid him his freight ver punctually;
sent him to the Philippines, loaded with J a an an China wares,
and a supercargo of their own, who, tra cking with the Spa-
niards, brought back European goods again, and a great quantity
of cloves and other spices; and there he was not only paid his
398 ADVENTURE! or
to sell the ship then, the merchant furnished him goods on his
own account; and with some money, and some spices of his own
which he brought with him, he went back to the Manillas to the
Spaniards, where he sold his cargo very well. Here, having got
a good acquaintance at Manilla, he got his ship made a free
ship ; and the governor of Manilla hired him to go to Acapulco
in America, on the coast of Mexico, and gave him a licence to
land there, and to travel to Mexico, and to pass in any Spanish
lhi to Europe with all his men. He made the voyage to Aca-
pulldo very happily, and there he sold his ship; and having there
also obtained allowance to travel by land to Porto Bello, he
found means, somehow or other, to get to Jamaica, with all his
treasure; and about eight years after came to England exceeding
rich, of which I shall take notice in its place: in the mean time,
398 ADVENTURE! or
Being now to part with the ship and ship’s company, it came
before us, of course, to consider what recompense we should
give to the two men that gave us such timely notice of the
iesign agamst us in the river Cambodia. The truth was, they had
done us a very considerable service, and deserved well at our
hands; though, by the way, they were a couple of rogues too:
for as they believed the story of our being pirates, and that we
had really run awa with the ship, they came down to us not
only to betray the esign that was formed against us, but to go
to sea with us as irates; and one of them confessed afterwards
that nothing else ut the hopes of going a-roguing brought him
to do it: however, the service they did us was not the less; and

dered the money to be paid them which they said was due to
them on board their respective ships; over and above that, I
gave each of them a small sum of money in old, which con-
tented them very well; then I made the Englis man nuer in
the ship, the gunner being now made second mate an purser;
the Dutchman I made boatswain; so they were both very well
pleased, and proved very serviceable, being both able seamen,
and very stout fellows.
We were now on shore in China: if I thought myself banished
and remote from my own country at Bengal, where I had many
ways to get home for my money, what could I think of myself
now, when I was got about a thousand leagues farther 06 from
home, and perfectly destitute of all manner of prospect of return?
All we had for it was this, that in about four months’ time there
was to be another fair at the place where we were, and then we
might be able to purchase all sorts of the manufactures of the

vessels from 'I‘onquin, that would be to be sold, and would carry
us and our goods whither we pleased. This I liked very well,
and resolved to wait; besides, as our particular persons were
not obnoxious, so if any English or Dutch ships came thither,
perhaps we might have an opportunity to load our goods, and
get passage to some other place in India, nearer home. Upon
these hopes we resolved to continue here; but, to divert our-
selves, we took two or three journeys into the country. First,
we went ten days' journey, to the city of Nanquin, a city well

it is regularly built, the streets all exactly straight, and cross

vantage. But when I come to compare the miserable people of
these countries with ours, their fabrics, their manner of hving,
their government, their religion, their wealth, and their glory,
as some call it, I must confess that I scarcely think it worth my
while to mention them here. It is very observable, that we
wonder at the grandeur, the riches, the pomp, the ceremonies,
the government, the manufactures, the commerce, and conduct
of these people; not that it is to be wondered at, or, indeed, in
the least to be regarded, but because having a true notion of
the barbarity of those countries, the rudeness and the ignorana

the strength of their armies, may be a little surprising to us;
because, as l have said, considering them as a barbarous nation
of pagans, little better than savages, we did not expect such
things among them. And this, indeed, is the advantage with
which all their greatness and power is represented to us; other-
wise, it is in itself nothing at all; for what I have said of their
ships may be said of their armies and troops: all the forces of
their empire, though they were to bring two millions of men into

all out of their country, and conquer them in one campaign : and
had the Czar (who is now a growing prince) fallen this way,
instead of attacking the warlike Swedes, and equally improved
himsen m the art of war, as they say he has done; and if none
of the powers of Europe had envied or interrupted him, he might
by this time have been emperor of China, instead of being beaten
by the king of Sweden at Narva, when the latter was not one to
six in number. As their strength and their grandeur, so their
navigation, commerce, and husbandry are very imperfect, com-
pared to the same things in Europe: also in their knowledge,
their learning, and in their skill in the sciences, they are either
very awkward or defective, though they have globes and spheres;
and a smattering of the mathematics, and think they know more
than all the world besides: but they know little of the motions
of the heavenly bodies; and so grossly and absurdly ignorant
are their common people, that when the sun is eclipsed, they
think a great dragon has assaulted it, and is going to run away
with it; and they fall a clattering with all the drums and kettles
in the country, to fright the monster away, just as we do to hive
a swarm of bees.
As this is the only excursion of the kind which I have made
in all the accounts I have given of my travels, I shall make no
more such: it is none of my business, nor any part of my design ;
but to give an accountof my own adventures through a lifeof inimi-
table wanderings, and a long variety of changes, which, perhaps,
few that come after me will have heard the like of: I shall there-
fore say very little of all the mighty places, desert countries, and
numerous people I have yet to pass through, more than relates
to my own story, and which my concern among them will make
necessary.




SECTION XLIlI.
'OUltNEY TO PEKING.—ROBINSON JOINS A CARAVAN PROCEEDING
TO MOSCOW.—RENCONTRF5 WITH THE TARTARSv
I was now, as near as I can compute, in the heart of China. about
thirty degrees north of the line, for we were returned from Nan-
quin: I had, indeed, a mind to see the city of Peking, which I had
heard so much of, and Father Simon importuned me daily to do
it. At length his time of going away being set, and the other
missionary who was to go with him being arrived from Macao,
it was necessary that we should resolve either to go or not; so
I referred it wholly to my partner, and left it wholly to his choice,
402 ADVEHTUREB or
402 ADVEHTUREB or
the way, for we got leave to travel in the retinue of one of their
Mandarins, a kind of viceroy or principal magistrates in the
province where they reside. and who take great state upon them,
travelling with great attendance, and with great homave from the
people, who are sometimes greatly impoverished byt em, being
obliged to furnish provisions for them and all their attendants
in their journeys. That which I particularly observed, as to our
travelling with his baggage, was this, that though we received
sufficient provisions both for ourselves and our horses from the
country, as belonging to the Mandarin, yet we were obliged to
pay for every thing we had,' after the market price of the
country, and the Mandarin's steward collected it duly from us;
so that our travelling in the rctinue of the Mandarin. though it
was a very great kindness to us, was not such a mighty favour in
him, but was a great advantage to him, considering there were
about thirty other people travelled in the same manner besides
us, under the protection of his retinuc; for the country furnished
all the provisions for nothing to him, and yet he took our money
for them.

nitely great, and exceeded by nothing but their poverty, in some
parts, which adds to that which I call their misery; and I
must needs think the naked savages of America live much more
happily than the poorest sort of these, because as they have
nothing, so they desire nothing: whereas these are proud and
insolent, and in the main are in many parts mere beggars and
drudges; their ostentation is inexpressible; and, if they can,
they love to keep multitudes of servants or slaves, which is to
the last degree ridiculous, as well as the contempt of all the
world but themselves.
I must confess, I travelled more pleasantly afterwards in the
deserts and vast wildernesses of Grand Tartary than here; and
yet the roads here are well paved and well kept, and very con-
venient for travellers: but nothing was more awkward to me
than to see such a haughty, imperious, insolent people, in the
midst of the grossest simplicity and ignorance; and my friend
Father Simon and I used to be very merry upon these occasions,
to ee the beggarly pride of these people. For example, coming
by the house of a. country gentleman, as Father Simon called

the honour to ride with the master of the house about two miles ;
the state he rode in was a perfect Don Quixotism, being a mix-

sleeves, tassels, and cuts and slashes almost on every side: it

was but a poor, starved, hobbling creature, and he had two
slaves followed him on foot to drive the poor creature along: be
tied a whip in his hand, and be belaboured the beast as fast about
the head as his slaves did about the tail; and thus he rode by us,
with about ten or twelve servants, going from the city to his
country seat, about half a league before us. We travelled on
nosmson causes. 403
as we stopped at a village about an hour to refresh us, when we
came by the country seat of this great man. we saw him in I
little place before his door, eatin his repast. It was a kind of a
garden, but he was very easy to £6 seen; and we were given to
understand that the more we looked at him the better he would
be pleased. He sat under a tree, something like the palmetto,
404 ADVENTURES 01'
side; but under the tree was also placed a large umbrella, which
made that part look well enough. He sat lolling back in a great
elbow-chair, being a heavy corpulent man, and had his meat
brought him by two women slaves; he had two more, one of
which fed the squire with a spoon, and the other held the dish

thought it below him to employ his own hands in any of those

404 ADVENTURES 01'
I took this time to think what pains men‘s pride puts them to,
and how troublesome a haughty temper, thus ill managed, must
be to a man of common sense; and leaving the poor wretch to
please himself with our looking at him, as if we admired his
pomp, though we really pitied and contemned him, we pursued
our journey: only Father Simon had the curiosity to stay to
inform himself what danties the country justice had to feed on
in all his state, which he had the honour to taste of, and
which was, I think, a mess of boiled rice, with a great piece of
404 ADVENTURES 01'
plant which they have there, something like our ginger, but
smelling like musk, and tasting like mustard; all this was put
together, and a small piece of lean mutton boiled in it, and this was
404 ADVENTURES 01'
tance, who, we supposed, were to eat of the same after their master.
As for our Mandarin with whom we travelled, he was respected
as a king, surrounded always with his gentlemen, and attended
in all his appearances with such pomp, that I saw little of him
but at a distance ; but this I observed, that there was not a horse
in his retinue but that our carrier's pack-horses in England
seemed to me to look much better; though it was hard to judge
rightly, for they were so covered with e uipage, mantles, trap-
pings, &c. that we could scarce see anyt ing but their feet and
their heads as they went along.
I was now light-hearted, and all my trouble and perplexity
that I have given an account of being over, I had no anxious
thought about me, which made this journey the pleasanter to
me; nor had I any ill accident attended me, only in passing or
for-ding a small river my horse fell, and made me free of the
country, as they call it, that is to say, threw me in: the place
was not deep, but it wetted me all over. I mention it, because
it spoiled my pocket-book, wherein I had set down the names
of several people and places which I had occasion to remember
and which, not taking due care of, the leaves rotted, and the
words were never after to be read, to my great loss as to the
names of some places I touched at in this journey.
At length we arrived at Peking: I had nobody with me but
the youth whom my nephew the captain had given me to attend
me as a servant, and who proved very trusty and diligent; and
my partner had nobody with him, but one servant, who was a
kinsman. As for the Portuguese pilot, he being desirous to see
the court, we bore his charges for his company, and to use him
as an interpreter, for he understood the language of the country,
and spoke good French, and a little English; and, indeed, this
old man was a most useful implement to us every where; for we
had not been above a week at Peking, when he came laughing
Ah, Senhor Inglese, says he, I have something to tell you will
make your heart glad !—My heart glad l says I; what can that
be? I don't know anything in this country can either give me
joy or grief, to any great degree—Yes, yes, said the old man, in
broken English, make you glad, me sorry.—Why, said I, will it
make you sorry ’l—Because, said he, you have brought me here
aosnvson causoa. 405
and which way shall I get to my port afterwards without a ship,
without a horse, without pecune : so he called money, being his
broken Latin, of which he had abundance to make us merry with.
In short, he told us there was a great caravan of Muscovite and
Polish merchants in the city, preparing to set out on their
aosnvson causoa. 405
was sure we would take the opportunity to go with them, and
leave him behind, to go back alone.
I confess I was greatly surprised with this good news, and
had scarce power to speak to him for some time; but at last I
turned to him, How do you know this? said I. Are you sure it
is truel—Yes, says he; I met this morning in the street an old
acquaintance of mine, an Armenian, who is among them: he came
last from Astracan, and was designing to go to Tonquin, where
I-formerly knew him, but has altered his mind, and is now re-
solved to go with the caravan to Moscow, and so down the river
Wolga to Astracan. Well, senhor, says I, do not he uneasy
about being left to go back alone; if this be a method for my
_ return to England, it shall be your fault if you go back to Macao
at all. We then went to consult together what was to be done;
and I asked my partner what he thought of the pilot’s news, and
whether it would suit with his affairs? He told me he would do
aosnvson causoa. 405
gal, and left his effects in such good hands, that as we had made
a good voyage here, if he could vest it in China silks, wrought
and raw, such as might be worth the carriage, he would be con-
tent to go to England, and then make his voyage back to Bengal
by the Company’s ships

Having resolved upon this, we agreed that if our Portuguese
pilot would go with us we would bear his charges to Moscow,
or to England, if he pleased; nor, indeed, were we to be
esteemed over generous in that neither, if we had not rewarded
him farther, the service he had done us being really worth more
than that: for he had not only been a pilot to us at sea, but he
had been like a broker for us on shore; and his procuring for
_us the Japan merchant was some hundreds of pounds in our
pockets. So we consulted together about it, and being willing
to gratify him, which was but doing him justice, and very will-
ing also to have him with us besides, for he was a most neces-
sary man on all occasions, we agreed to give him a quantit of
coined gold, which, as I compute it, came to about one hun red
406 anvan'roam or
charges, both for himself and horse, except only a horse to carry
his goods. Having settled this between ourselves, we called him
to let him know what we had resolved. I told him he had com-
plained of our being to let him go back alone, and I was now to
tell him we were resolved he should not go back at all; that as
we had resolved to go to Europe with the caravan, we resolved
also he should go with us; and that we called him to know his
mind. He shook his head, and said, it was a long journey, and
he had no pecune to carry him thither, or to subsist himself when
he came there. We told him we believed it was so, and therefore
we had resolved to do something for him that should let him see
how sensible we were of the service he had done us, and also
how agreeable he was to us: and then I told him what we had
resolved to give him here, which he might lay out as we would
do our own; and that as for his charges, ifhe would go with us
we would set him safe on shore (life and casualties excepted)
either in Muscovy or England, which he would, at our own
charge, except only the carriage of his goods. He received the
proposal like a man transported, and told us he would go with
us over the whole world; and so we all prepared for our journey.
However, as it was with us, so it was with the other merchants:
406 anvan'roam or
weeks, it was four months and some days before all things were
got together.
It was the beginning of February, our style, when we set out
from Peking. My partner and the old pilot had gone express
406 anvan'roam or
goods which we had left there: and I, with a Chinese merchant
whom I had some knowledge of at Nanquin, and who came to
Peking on his own affairs, went to Nanquin, where I bought
406 anvan'roam or
406 anvan'roam or
and had all these brought to Peking against my partner's return:
besides this, we bought a very large quantity of raw silkA and
some other goods, our cargo amounting, in these gooos onl ,

sonmsou CRUSOE. 401
loads of nutmegs and cloves, loaded in all eighteen camels for
our share, besides those we rode upon; which, with two or
three spare horses, and two horses loaded with provisions, made
us, in short, twenty-six camels and horses in our retinue.
The company was very great, and, as near as I can remember,
made between three and four hundred horse, and upwards of
one hundred and twenty men, very well armed, and provided
for all events: for as the Eastern caravans are subject to be
attacked by the Arabs, so are these by the Tar-tars; but they are
not altogether so dangerous as the Arabs, nor so barbarous,
when they prevail.
The company consisted of people of several nations; but there
were above sixty of them merchants or inhabitants of Moscow,
though of them some were Livonians; and to our particular
sonmsou CRUSOE. 401
men of great experience in business, and of very good substance.
When we had travelled one day's journey, the guides, who
sonmsou CRUSOE. 401
that is to say, all the passengers except the servants, to a great
council, as they called it. At this council every one deposited
a certain quantity of money to a common stock, for the 1180887
sary expense of buying forage on the way, where it was not
otherwise to be had, and for satisfying the guides, getting horses,
and the like: and here they constituted the journey, as they call
sonmsou CRUSOE. 401
give the word of command, in case of an attack, and give every
one their turn of command; nor was this forming us into order
any more than what we found needful upon the way, as shall
be observed.
The road all on this side of the country is very populou, and
is full of potters and earth makers, that is to say, people that
temper the earth for the China-ware; and as I was coming along,
our Portugal pilot, who had always something or other to say
to make us merry, came sneering to me, and told me he would
show me the greatest rarity in all the country, and that I should
have this to say of China, after all the ill-humoured things I had
said of it, that I had seen one thing which was not to be seen in
all the world beside. I was very importunate to know what it
was: at last he told me it was a gentleman’s house built with
China-ware. Well, says I, are not the materials of their build-
ings the product of their own country, and so it is all China-ware,
is it not ?—No, no, says he, I mean it is a house all made of
China-ware, such as you call it in England, or, as it is called in
our country, porcelain.—Well, says I, such a thing may be; how
big is it? Can we carry it in a box upon a camel? If we can,
We will buy it.—Upon a camel! says the old pilot, holding up
both his hands ; why there is a family of thirty people lives in it.
I was then curious, indeed, to see it; and when I came to it
it was nothing but this: it was a timber house, or a house built,
as we call it in England, with lath and plaster; but all this
plastering was really China-ware, that is to say, it was plastered
with the earth that makes China-ware. The outside, which the
sun shone hot upon, was glazed, and looked very well, perfectly
a 408 ADVENTURES C I
Fngland is painted, and hard as if it had been burned. As to
the inside, all the walls, instead of wainscot, were lined with
hardened and painted tiles, like the little square tiles we call
a 408 ADVENTURES C I
a 408 ADVENTURES C I
a 408 ADVENTURES C I
a 408 ADVENTURES C I
a 408 ADVENTURES C I
the rooms were of the same composition, and as hard as the
a 408 ADVENTURES C I
hard as stone, and smooth, but not burned and painted, except
some smaller rooms, like closets, which were all as it were paved
with the same tile: the ceiling, and all the lasterin work in
the whole house, were of the same earth; an , after al , the roof
was covered with tiles of the same, but of a deep shining black.
This was a China warehouse, indeed, truly and literally to be
called so, and had I not been upon the journey, I could have
stayed some days to see and examine the particulars of it. They
a 408 ADVENTURES C I
a 408 ADVENTURES C I
set up in rows on the walks, entirely formed of the porcelain
earth, and burned whole.
As this is one of the singularities of China, so they may be
allowed to excel in it; but I am very sure they excel in their
accounts of it ; for they told me such incredible things of their per
formance in crockery-ware, for' such it is, that I care not to relate,
as knowing it could not be true. They told me, in particular,
of one workman that made a ship with all its tackle, and masts
a 408 ADVENTURES C I
the had told me he launched it, and made a voyage to Japan in
it, {might have said something to it, indeed; but as it was, I
knew the whole of the story, which was, in short, asking pardon
for the word, that the fellow lied: so I smiled, and said nothing
to it.
This odd sight kept me two hours behind the caravan, for
a 408 ADVENTURES C I
three shillings; and told me, if it had been three days‘ journey
a 408 ADVENTURES C I
me four times as much, and made me ask pardon the next
council day: I promised to be more orderly; and, indeed, I found
afterwards the orders made for keeping all together were abso-
lutely necessary for our common safety.
In two days more we passed the great China wall, made for a
ROBINSON CRUSOE. 409
going over hills and mountains in a needless track, where the
rocks are impassable, and the precipices such as no enemy could
possibly enter, or indeed climb up, or where, if they did, no wall
could hinder them. They tell us its length is near a thousand
ROBINSON CRUSOE. 409
measured line, which the wall bounds, without measuring the.
windings and turnings it takes: it is about four fathoms high,
and as many thick in some places.
I stood still an hour, or thereabout, without trespassing our
orders (for so long the caravan was in passing the gate), to look
at it on every side, near and far off, I mean that was within my
View; and the guide of our caravan, who had been extolling it
for the wonder of the world, was mighty eager to hear my
opinion of it. I told him it was a most excellent thing to keep
out the Tartars-; which he happened not to understand as I
meant it, and so took it for a compliment; but the old pilot
laughed: O, Senhor lnglese, says he, you speak in colours.—In
colours! said I; what do you mean by that ’t—Why you speak
what looks white this way, and black that way: gay one way,
and dull another. You tell him it is a good wall to keep out
Tartars; you tell me by that it is good for nothing but to keep
out Tartars. I understand you, Senhor Inglese; I understand
you; but Senhor Chinese understood you his own way.—Well,
says I, senhor, do you think it would stand out an army of our
country people, with a good train of artillery, or our engineers,
with two companies of miners? Would not they batter it down
in ten days, that an army might enter in battalia; or blow it up in
the air, foundation and all, that there should be no sign of it left?
-—Ay, ay, says he, I know that. The Chinese wanted mightily
to know what I said, and I gave him leave to tell him a few days
after, for we were then almost out of their country, and he was to
leave us in a little time after this; but when he knew what I said,

was after we entered the wilder part of the country. Our leader
for the day gave leave for about sixteen of us to go a hunting,
as they call it, and what was this but hunting of sheep: how-
ever, it may be called hunting too, for the creatures are the
wildest and swiftest of foot that ever I saw of their kind; only
they will not run a great way, and you are sure of sport when
you begin the chase, for they appear generally thirt or forty in

In pursuit of this odd sort of game, it was our hap to meet
with about forty Tartars ; whether they were hunting mutton as
we were, or whether they looked for another kind of prey, we
know not; but as soon as they saw us, one of them blew a kind
of horn very loud, but with a barbarous sound that I had never
heard before, and, by the way, never care to hear again: we all
supposed this was to call their friends about them, and so it

as it happened.
One of the Scots merchants of Moscow happened to be
amongst us, and as soon as he heard the horn he told us that
we had nothing to do but to charge them immediately, without
loss of time; and drawing us up in a line, he asked if we were
resolved. We told him we were ready to follow him; so he rode
directly towards them. They stood gazing at us like a mere

I asked our guides whose dominion this was in; and they
told me this was a kind of border, that might be called no man’s
land, being a part of Great Karakathay, or Grand Tartary: but,
however, it was all reckoned as belonging to China, but that

to me, we saw, two or three times, little parties of the Tartars,

had nothing to say to us, we had nothing to say to them; we
let them go, Once, however, a party of them came so near as
to stand and gaze at us 2- whether it was to consider if they
should attack us or not, we knew not: but when we were passed

two miles out of the village, where it seems they kept the camels
and horses feeding under a guard.
I walked it on foot, with my old pilot and a Chinese, being
very desirous of a little variety. When we came to the place,
it was a low marshy ground, walled round with a stone wall,
piled up dry, without mortar or earth among it, like a park,
with a little guard of Chinese soldiers at the door. Having
bought a camel, and agreed for the price, I came away, and the
Chineseman that went with me led the camel,-when on a sudden

short upon my drawing my sword, for they are errant cowards ;
but a second coming upon my left, gave me a blow on the head,
which I never felt till afterwards, and wondered, when I came
to myself, what was the matter, and where I was, for he laid me
‘iat on the ground; but my never-failing old pilot, the Portu-
guese (so Providence, unlooked for, directs deliverances from
dangers which to us are unforeseen), had a pistol in his pocket,
which I knew nothing of, nor the Tartar-s neither: if they had,
I suppose they would not have attacked us; but cowards are
always boldest when there is no danger. The old man seeing
me down, with a bold heart stepped up to the fellow that had
struck me, and laying hold of his arm with one hand, and pulling
him ‘down by main force a little towards him with the other,
shot him in the head, and laid him dead upon the spot. He
then immediately stepped up to him who had stopped us, as I
said, and before he could come forward again, made a blow at
him with a scimitar which he always were, but missing the man,
out his horse in the side of his head, out one of the ears of!“ by
the root, and a great slice down by therside of his face. The
poor beast, enraged with the wound, was no more to be governed
by his rider, though the fellow sat well enough too, but away

some distance, rising upon his hind legs, threw down the Tartar,
and fell upon him.
In this interval, the poor Chinese came in who had lost the
camel, but he had no weapon : however, seeing the Tartar
down, and his horse fallen upon him, away he runs to him,
and seizing-upon an ugly ill-favoured weapon he had by his
side, something like a pole-axe, but not a pole-axe neither, he
vrenched it from him, and made shift to knock his 'Iarlarian
brains out with i:. But my old man had the third Tartar to

the old man stood still too, an fell to work with his tackle, to
harge his pistol again; but as soon as the Tartar saw the pistol,
away he scoured, and left my pilot, my champion I called him
afterwards, a complete victory.
By this time I was a little recovered; for I thought‘when I

said above, I wondered where I was, how I came upon the
ground, and what was the matter. But a few moments after,
as sense returned, I felt pain, though] did not know where;
so I clapped my hand to my head, and took it away bloody:
then I felt my head ache; and then, in a moment, memory re-
turned, and every thing was present to me again. I jumped
upon my feet instantly, and got hold of m sword, but no
enemies in view: I found a Tartar lie dea , and his horse
standing very uietly by him; and, looking further, I saw my
champion and deliverer, who had been to see what the Chinese
had done, coming back with his hanger in his hand: the old
man, seeing me on my feet, came running to me, and embraced
me with a great deal of joy, being afraid before that I had been
killed; and seeing me bloody, would see how I was hurt: but it
was not much, only what we call a broken head; neither did I

well again in two or three days.
We made no great gain, however, by this victory, for we lost
a camel and gained a horse; but that which was remarkable,
when we came back to the village, the man demanded to be paid
for the camel; I disputed it, and it was brought to a hearing
before the Chinese judge of the place. To give him his due, he
acted with a great deal of prudence and impartiality; and, having
heard both sides, he gravely asked the Chinese man that went
with me to buy the camel, whose servant he was? I am no
servant, says he, but went with the stranger.-—At whose re-
quest? says the justice. At the stranger's request, says be.
Why, then, says the justice, you were the stranger’s servant for
the time; and the camel being delivered to his servant, it was
delivered to him, and he must pay for it.
I confess the thing was so clear, that I had not a word to say:
but, admiring to see such just reasoning upon the conse uence,
and an accurate stating of the case, I paid willingl or the
camel, and sent for another; but, you may observe, I 'd not go
to fetch it myself any more, for I ad had enough of that.

with their bows and arrows; but to call it strong, if it were
attacked with cannon, would be to make those who understand
it laugh at you.
We wanted, as I have said, above two days’ journey of this
city, when messengers were sent express to every part of the
road to tell all travellers and caravans to halt till they had a
guard sent for them; for that an unusual body of Tar-tars,
making ten thousand in all, had appeared in the way, about
thirty miles beyond the city.
This was ver bad news to travellers; however, it was care-
fully done of the governor, and we were very glad to hear we
should have a guard. Accordingly, two days after, we had two
hundred soldiers sent us from a garrison of the Chinese, on our
left, and three hundred more from the city of Naurn, and with
these we advanced boldly; the three hundred soldiers from
Naum marched in our front, the two hundred in our rear, and
our men on each side of our camels, with our baggage, and the
whole caravan in the centre: in this order, and well prepared
for battle, we thought ourselves a match for the whole ten
thousand Mogul Tar-tars, if they had appeared; but the next
day, when they did appear, it was quite another thin .
It was early in the morning, when, marching f cm a well
situated little town, called Changu, we had a river to pass,
which we were obliged to ferry; and, had the Tartars had any
intelligence, then had been the time to have attacked us, when
the caravan being over, the rear guard was behind; but they
did not appear there. About three hours after, when we were

behold, by a cloud of dust they raised, we saw an enemy was at
hand; and they were at hand, indeed, for they came on upon
the spur.
The Chinese, our guard on the front, who had talked so big
the day before, began to stagger; and the soldiers frequently
looked behind them, which is a certain sign in a soldier that he
is just ready to run away. My old pilot was of my mind; and,
being near me, called out, Senhor Inglese, says he, those fellows
must be encouraged, or they will ruin us all; for if the Tartars
come on, they will never stand it.—I am of your mind, said I;

our posture, traversing the ground in the front of our line; and, as
we found them within gun-shot, our leader ordered the two
wings to advance swiftly, and give them a salvo on each wing
with their shot, which was done; but they went off, and I sup-
pose back, to give an account of the reception they were likely
to meet with; and, indeed, that salute cloyed their stomachs, for
they immediately halted, stood awhile to consider of it, and wheel-
ing off to the left, they gave over their design, and said no more
to us for that time; which was very agreeable to our circum-
stances, which were but very indifferent for a battle with such a.
number.
Two days after we came to the city of Naun, or Naum; we
thanked the governor for his care of us, and collected to the
value of a hundred crowns, or thereabouts, which we gave to
the soldiers sent to guard us; and here we rested one day. This
is a garrison, indeed, and there were nine hundred soldiers kept
here; but the reason of it was, that formerly the Muscovite
frontiers lay nearer to them than they now do, the Muscovites

use; and more especially being so very remote, and so difficult
to send troops thither for its defence: for we had yet above two
thousand miles to Muscovy, properly so called.
After this we passed several great rivers, and two dreadful
deserts; one of which we were sixteen days passing over; and
which, as I said, was to be called no man’s land; and, on the

soon arrived in, as I called it, a Christian country, or, at least, in
a country governed by Christians; for though the Muscovites

would certainly occur to any man who travels the world as I

but had their pagods, their idols, and their temples, and ignorant
people worshipping even the works of their own hands. Now
we came where, at least, a face of the Christian worship appeared;
where the knee was bowed to Jesus; and whether ignorantly or
not, yet the Christian religion was owned, and the name of the
true God was called up0n and adored, and it made my soul re-

of the substance for some months farther of our journey. _Well,

farther, is inhabited by the worst and most ignorant of pagans

WE were nov ‘aunched into the greatest piece of solid earth, if I

if some people may be believed, there might be no sea, north-

north-west, and so had a continent of land into America, the
Lord knows where; though I could give some reasons why I
believe that to be a mistake.

before we came to any considerable towns, we had nothing to

as I understood by the charts, which some in our caravan had
with them, it was plain all those rivers ran into the great river
Yamour, or Amour; which river, by the natural course of it,
must run into the East sea, or Chinese Ocean. The story they
tell us, that the mouth of this river is choked up with bulrushes
of a monstrous growth, viz. three feet about. and twenty or thirty
feet high, I must be allowed to say, I believe nothing of it; but,
as its navigation is of no use. because there is no trade that way,
the Tartars, to whom it alone belongs, dealing in nothing but
cattle, so nobody, that ever I heard of. has been curious enough

Some leagues to the north of this river there are several con-
siderable rivers, whose streams run as due north as the Yamour
runs east, and these are all found to join their waters with the
great river Tartarus, named so from the northermost nations
4 l 8 ADVENTURE 01'
Tartars in the world; and who, as our geographers allege, are
the Gog and Magog mentioned in sacred 'story. These rivers
running all northward, as well as all the other rivers I am et to
speak of, make it evident that the northern ocean boun s the
land also on that side; so that it does not seem rational in the
least to think that the land can extend itself to join with America
on that side, or that there is not a communication between the
northern and eastern ocean: but of this I shall say no more; it
was my observation at that time, and therefore I take notice of
it in this place.
We now advanced from the river Arguna by easy and moderate
journeys, and were very visibly obliged to the care the Czar of
Muscovy has taken to have cities and towns built in as many
places as it is possible to place them, where his soldiers keep
garrison, something like the stationary soldiers placed by the
Romans in the remotest countries of their empire; some of which
that I had read of were placed in Britain, for the security of com-
merce, and for the lodging travellers; and thus it was here: for
wherever we came, though at these towns and stations the gar-
risons and governors were Russians and professed Christians, ye‘:

Some instances of this we met within the country between
Arguna, where we enter the Muscovite dominions, and a city
of Tartars and Russians together, called Nertzinskoi, in which
is a continued desert or forest, which cost us twenty days to
travel over. In a village, near the iast of these places, I had the
curiosity to go and see their way of living, which is most brutish

made of wood, frightful as the devil; at least, as an thing we
ean think of to represent the devil can be made: it ad a head
not so much as resembling any creature that the world ever saw;
ears as big as oats’horns, and as high; eyes as big as acrown
piece ; a nose 'ke a crooked ram’s-horn, and a mouth extended

manner that you could suppose: its upper arment was of sheep-
skins, with the wool outward; a great artar bonnet on the
head, with two horns growing through it: it was about eight feet
high, yet had no feet or legs, nor any other proportion of arts.
This scarecrow was set up at the outer side of the vi lage;
and, when I came near to it, there were sixteen or seventeen
creatures, whether men or women I could not tell, for they made

when I came a little nearer, they started up upon their feet, and
raised a howling cr , as if it had been so many deep-mouthed
hounds, and walke away, as if they were displeased at our dis-
turbing them. A little way off from the idol, and at the door of
a tent or hut, made all of sheep-skins and cow-skins dried, stood
three butchers,——I thought they were such: when I came nearer
to them, I found they had long knives in their hands; and in
the middle of the tent appeared three sheep killed, and one young

log of an idol; the three men were priests belonging to it, and
the seventeen prostrated-wretches were the people who brought
the offering, and were making their prayers to that stock.
I confess, I was more moved at their stupidity and brutish
worship of a hobgoblin than ever I was at anythin in my life;
to see God's most lorious and best creature, to w om he had
granted so many a vantages, even by creation above the rest of
the works of his hands, vested with a reasonable soul, and that
soul adorned with faculties and capacities adapted both to honour
his Maker, and be honoured by him, sunk and degenerated to a

thoughts : thus it was, and I saw it before my eyes, and there
was no room to wonder at at, or- think it impossible: all my
admiration turned to rage, and I rode up to the image or mon-
ster, call it what you will, and with my sword made a stroke at
the bonnet that was on its head, and cut it in two; and one of
our men that was with me took hold of the sheep-skin that
covered it, and pulled at it; when, behold, a most hideous out-
cry and howling ran through the village, and two or three hun-
dred people came about my ears, so that I was glad to scour for
it, for we saw some had bows and arrows ; but I resolved from
that moment to visit them again.
Our caravan rested three nights at the town, which was about
four miles off, in order to rovide some horses which they
wanted, several of the horses having been lamed and jaded with
the badness of the way, and long march over the last desert; so
we had some leisure here to put my desi n in execution. I
communicated my design to the Scots mere ant of Moscow, of
whose courage I had sufficient testimony: I told him what I
had seen, and with what indignation I had since thought that
human nature could be so degenerate; Itold him, if I could get

nations of them that knows anything of a letter, or how to read
a word any way.—Wretched ignorance! said Ito him : however,
I have a great mind to do it; perhaps nature ma draw infer-
ences from it to them, to let them see how brutish they are to
worship such horrid things.—Look you, sir, said he, if your
zeal prompts you to it so warmly, you must do it; but, in the
next place, I would have you consider, these wild nations of
people are subjected by force to the Czar of Muscovy’s domi-
nion, and if you do this, it is ten to one but they will come by
thousands to the governor of N ertzinskoi, and demand satisfac-
tion; and if he cannot give them satisfaction, it is ten to one but
they revolt; and it will occasion a new war with all the Taitars
in the country.
This, I confess, put new thoughts into my head for awhile,
but I harped upon the same string still; and all that day I was
uneasy to put my project in execution. Towards the evening
the Scots merchant met me by accident in our walk about the
town, and desired to speak with me: I believe, said he, I have

just as it is related before; and I added, that ] thought we ought
to do so to this village.
He listened very attentively to the story; but when I talked
of doing so to that'village, said he, You mistake very much; it
was not this village, it was almost a hundred miles from this

to go also with us: and one, said he, as famous for his zeal as
youcan desire any one to be against such devilish things as
these. In a word, he brought me his comrade, a Scotsman, whom
he called Captain Richardson; and gave him a full account of
what I had seen, and also what I intended; and he told me
readily, he would go with me if it cost him his life. So we agreed
to go, only we three. I had, indeed, proposed it to my partner,
but he declined it. He said, he was ready to assist me to the
utmost, and upon all occasions, for my defence; but this was an
adventure quite out of his way: so, I say, we resolved upon our
work, only we three and my man-servant, and to put it in execu-
tion that night about midnight, with all the secrecy imaginable.
However, upon second thoughts, we were willing to dela it
till the next night, because, the caravan being to set forwar in
the morning, we supposed the governor could not pretend to,
give them any satisfaction upon us when we were out of his
power. The Scots merchant, as stead in his resolution for the
enterprise as bold in executing, broug t me a Tartar’s robe or
gown of sheep-skins, and a bonnet, with a bow and arrows, and
had provided the same for himself and his countryman, that the
people, if they saw us, should not determine who we were.

we could get; and, having a good quantity of tar in a little pot,
about an hour after night we set out upon our expedition.
We came to the place about eleven o’clock at night, and found
that the people had not the least jealousy of danger attending
their idol. The night was cloudy; yet the moon gave us light
enough to see that the idol stood just in the same posture and
place that it did before. The people seemed to be all at their
rest; only, that in the great hut, or tent, as we called it, where
we saw the three priests whom we mistook for butchers, we saw
a light; and going up close to the door, we heard people talking

merchant, I will tell you what we will do: we will try to make
them prisoners, tie their hands, and make them stand and see
their idol destroyed.

one of the priests coming to it, we immediately seized upon him,
stopped his mouth, and tied his hands behind him, and led him
to the idol, where we gagged him that he might not make a
noise, tied his feet also together, and left him on the ground.
Two of us then waited at the door, expecting that another
would come out, to see what the matter was; but we waited so
long till the third man came back to us; and then nobody coming
out, we knocked again gently, and immediately out came two
more, and we served them just in the same manner, but were
obliged to go all with them, and lay them down by the idol some
distance from one another; when, going back, we found two more
were come out to the door, and a third stood behind them within
the door. We seized the two, and immediately tied them, when
the third stepping back, and crying out, my Scots merchant went

We stayed by it a quarter of an hour, or thereabouts, till the
powder in the eyes and mouth and ears of the idol blew up, and,
as we could perceive, had split anddeformed the shape of it:
and, in a word, till we saw it burned into a mere block or log of
wood; and setting dry forage to it, we found it would be soon
quite consumed; so we began to think of going away: but the

consternation, for they said the Tartars were already no less than
thirty thousand strong. The Russian governor sent out mes-
sengers to appease them, and ave them all the good words
imaginable; assuring them that e knew nothing of it, and that
there had not a soul in his garrison been abroad, so that it could
not be from any body there; but if they could let him know who
did it, they should be exemplarily punished. They returned
haughtily, that all the country reverenced the great Cham Chi-
Thaungu, who dwelt in the sun, and no mortal would have dared
to offer violence to his im e but some Christian miscreant; and
they therefore resolved to enounce war against him and all the
Russians, who, they said, were miscreants and Christians.
The governor, still patient, and unwilling to make a breach,
or to have any cause of war alleged to be given by him, the
Czar having strictly charged them to treat the conquered country
with gentleness and civilit , gave them still all the good words
he could. At last he told them there was a caravan gone towards
Russia that morning, and perhaps it was some of them who had

that, he would send after them to inquire into it. This seemed
to appease them a little; and accordingly the governor sent
after us, and gave us a particular account how the thing was;
intimating withal, that if any in our caravan had done it, they
should make their escape; but that, whether we had done it or
no, we should make all the haste forward that was possible; and
that, in the mean time, he would keep them in play as long as
he could.
This was very friendly in the governor: however, when it
came to the caravan, there was nobody knew any thing of the
matter; and as for us that were guilty, we were least of all
suspected. However, the captain of the caravan for the time
too the hint that the governor gave us, and we travelled two
days and two nights without any cons1derable stop, and then
we lay at a village called Plothus . nor did we make any long
stop here, but hastened on towards Jarawena, another of the
czar of Muscovy’s colonies, and where we expected we should
be safe. But upon the second day’s march from Plothus, by
the clouds of dust behind us at a great distance, some of our
people began to be sensible we were pursued. We had entered
a great desert, and had passed by a great lake called Schaks
Oser, when we perceived a very great body of horse appear on
the other side of the lake, to the north, we travelling west. We
observed they went away west, as we did, but had supposed we
would have taken that side of the lake, whereas we very happily
took the south side; and in two days more they disappeared
again : for they, believing we were still before them, pushed on
till they came to the river Udda, a very great river when it
passes farther north, but when we came to it we found it narrow
and fordable.
The third day, they had either found their mistake, or had
intelligence of us, and came pouring in upon us towards the
dusk of the evening. We had, to our great satisfaction, just
pitched upon a place for our camp, which was very convenient
for the night; for as we were upon a desert, though but at the
ROBINSON CRUSOE. 425
no towns to lodge at, and, indeed, expected none but the city
Jarawena, which we had yet two days’ march to: the desert,
however, had some few woods in it on this side, and little rivers,
which ran all into the great river Udda; it was in a narrow
strait, between little but very thick woods, that we pitched
our little camp for that night, expecting to be attacked before
morning.
Nobody knew but ourselves what we were pursued for: but
as it was usual for the Mogul Tartars to go about in troops in
that desert, so the caravans always fortify themselves every night
against them, as against armies of robbers ; and it was therefore
no new thing to be pursued.
But we had this night, of all the nights of our travels, a most
advantageous camp ; for we lay between two woods, with a little
rivulet running just before our front, so that we could not be
surrounded, or attacked any way but in our front or rear. We
took care also to make our front as strong as we could, by
placing our packs, with our camels and horses, all in a line
on the inside of the river, and felling some trees in our rear.
In this posture we encamped for the night; but the enemy

upon this, they said, they would go away, and do us no further
harm, otherwise they would‘destroy us all. Our men looked
very blank at this message. and began to stare at one another,
to see who looked with the most guilt in their faces a but,
nobody was the word; nobody did it. The leader of the cata-
van sent word he was well assured that it was not done by any
of our camp ; that we were peaceable merchants, travelling on
our business; that we had done no harm to them or to any one
else; and that, therefore, they must look farther for their ene-
mies who had injured them, for we were not the people; so
desired them not to disturb us, for, if they did. we should defend
ourselves.

Some time after this, we saw them move a little to our right,
and eXpected them on the rear ; when a cunning fellow, a Cossack
of J arawena, in the pay of the Muscovites, calling to the leader
of the caravan, said to him, I’ll go send all these people away to

right, and rather behind us. So he takes his bow and arrows,
and gettin on horseback, he rides away from our rear directly,
as it were ack to Nertzinskoi; after this, he takes a great cir-
cuit about, and comes directly on the army of the Tartars, as if
he had been sent express to tell them a long story, that the
people who had burned the Cham Chi-Thaungu were gone to
Siheilka, with a caravan of miscreants, as he cal ed them, that is
to say, Christians ; and that they had resolved to burn the god

caravan being exceedingly fatigued with the last day's hard
march, and with want of rest in the night.
From this city we had a frightful desert, which held us twenty-
three days’ march. We furnished ourselves with some tents
here, for the better accommodating ourselves in the night; and
the leader of the caravan procured sixteen carriages, or waggonl

at the country for carrying our water or prowsions; and these
earriages were our defence, every night, round our little camp;
so that had the Tartars appeared, unless they had been very
numerous indeed, they would not have been able to hurt us.
We may well be supposed to want rest again after this lon
|ourney: for in this desert we neither saw house nor tree, and
scarce a bush; though we saw abundance of the sable-hunters,
who are all Tartars of the Mogul Tartary, of which this country
.s a part; and they frequently attack small caravans, but we saw
no numbers of them together.
After we had passed this desert, we came into a country pretty
well inhabited; that is to say, we found towns and castles, settled
oy the czar of Muscovy, with garrisons of stationary soldiers,
to protect the caravans, and defend the country against the
Tartars, who would otherwise make it very dangerous travel-
ling; and his czarish majesty has given such strict orders for
the well guarding the caravans and merchants, that, if there are
any Tartars heard of in the country, detachments of the garri-
sons are always sent to see the travellers safe from station to

civilized; but I found myself mistaken in both: for we had yet
the nation of the Tongueses to pass through, where we saw the
same tokens of paganism and barbarity as before; only, as they
were conquered by the Muscovites, they were not so dangerous;
but for rudeness of manners, and idolatry, no people in the
world ever went beyond them: they are clothed all in skins of
beasts, and their houses are built of the same; you know not a
man from a woman, neither by the ruggedness of their counte-
nances nor their clothes; and in the winter, when the ground is
covered with snow, they live underground in vaults, which have
cavities going from one to another.

came to Janezay, a Muscovite city or station on the great river
Janezay (Yenisey), which, they told us there, parted Europe
from Asia.
Here I observed ignorance and paganism still prevailed, ex-
cept in the Muscovite garrisons; all the country between the
river Oby and the river Janezay is as entirely pagan, and the
people as barbarous, as the remotest of the Tartars; nay, as an
nation, for aught I know, in Asia or America. I also foun ,
which I observed to the Muscovite governors whom I had an
opportunity to converse with, that the poor pagans are not
much wiser, or nearer Christianity, for being under the Musco-
vite government; which they acknowledged was true enough:
but that, as they said, was none of their business: that if the
czar expected to convert his Siberian, Tonguese, or Tartar sub-
jects, it should be done by sending clergymen among them, not
soldiers: and, they added, with more sincerity than I expected,
that they found it was not so much the concern of their monarch
to make the people Christians as it was to make them subjects.
From this river to the great river Oby, we crossed a wild
uncultivated country, barren of people and good management;
otherwise it is in itself a most pleasant, fruitful, and agreeable
country. What inhabitants we found in it are all pagans,
except such as are sent among them from Russia: for this is
the country, I mean on both sides the river Oby, whither the
Muscovite criminals that are not put to death are banished, and
from whence it is next to impossible they should ever come away.

came to 'l‘obolski, the capital city of Siberia, where I continued
some time on the following occasion. '
We had now been almost seven months on our journey, and
winter began to come on apace; whereupon my partner and I
called a council about our particular affairs, in which we found
it proper, as we were bound for England, and not for Moscow,
to consider how to dispose of ourselves. They told us of
sledges and reindeer to carry us over the snow in the winter
time; and, indeed, they have such things that it would be in-
credible to relate the particulars of, by which means the Russians
travel more in the winter than they can in summer, as in these
sledges they are able to run night and day: the snow being
frozen, is one universal covering to nature, by which the hills,
vales, rivers, and lakes are all smooth and hard as a stone,
and they run upon the surface, without any regard to what is
underneath.
But I had no occasion to push at a winter journey of this
kind; I was bound to England, not to Moscow, and my route
lay two ways: either I must go on as the caravan went, till I
came to J aroslaw, and then go off west for Narva, and the gull
of Finland, and so to Dantzic, where I might possibly sell my
China cargo to good advantage; or I must leave the caravan at
a little town on the Dwina, from whence I had but six days by
water to Archangel, and from thence might be sure of shipping
either to England, Holland, or Hamburgh.
Now, to go any of these journeys in the winter would have
been preposterous: for as to Dantzic, the Baltic would have been
frozen up, and I could not get, passage; and to go by land in
those countries was far less safe than among the Mogul Tartars:
likewise, to go to Archangel in October, all the ships would be
gone from thence, and even the merchants who dwell there in
summer retire south to Moscow in the winter, when the ships
are gone; so that I could have nothing but extremity of cold
to encounter, with a scarcity of provisions, and must lie in an
empty town all the winter: so that, upon the whole, I thought
it much my better way to let the caravan go, and make provi-
sion to winter where I was, at Tobolski, in Siberia, in the lati-
tude of about sixty degrees, where I was sure of three things to
wear out a cold winter with, viz. plenty of provisions, such as

By this means, we had always the same climate in all the rooms,

The most wonderful thing of all was, that it should be possi—
ble to meet with good company here, in a country so barbarous
as that of the most northerly parts of Europe, near the frozen
ocean, within but a very few degrees of Nova Zembla. But this
being the country where the state criminals of Muscovy, as I
observed before, are all banished, this city was full of noblemen,
gentlemen, soldiers, and courtiers of Muscovy. Here was the
r F 2
famous prince Gallitzen, the old eneral Robostiski, and sevem‘
other persons of note, and some ladies. By means of my Scott
merchant, whom, nevertheless, I parted with here, I made an
acquaintance with several of these gentlemen; and from these,
in the long winter nights in which I stayed here, I received seve-
ral very agreeable visits.
It was talking one night with Prince ———, one of the
banished ministers of state belonging to the czar of Muscovy,
that the discourse of my particular case began. He had been
-I3l) ADVENTURE 0P
-I3l) ADVENTURE 0P

and more powerful prince than even the czar of Muscovy was,

eyes steadily upon me, began to wonder what I meant. I told
him his wonder would cease when I had explained myself.
First, I told him I had absolute disposal of the lives and fortunes
of all my subjects; that, notwithstanding my absolute power,

person, in all my dominions. He shook his head at that, and
said, There, indeed, l outdid the czar of Muscovy. I told him
that all the lands in my kingdom were my own, and all my sub-
jects were not only my tenants, but tenants at will; that they
-I3l) ADVENTURE 0P
for such I acknowledged myself to be, was ever so universally
beloved, and yet so horribly feared by his subjects.
After amusing him with these riddles in government for a
while, I opened the case, and told him the story at, large of my
living in the island; and how I managed both myself and the
people that were under me, just as I have since minuted it
own. They were exceedin ly taken with the stor , and
especially the prince, who tol me, with a sigh, that the true
greatness of life was to be masters of ourselves; that he would
not have exchanged such a state of life as mine to be czar of
Muscovy; and that he found more felicity in the retirement he
seemed to be banished to there, than ever he found in the
highest authority he enjoyed in the court of his master the czar;
that the height of human wisdom was to bring our tempers
down to our circumstances, and to make a calm within, under
the weight of the greatest storms without. When he came

little time and consideration had made him look into himself, as
well as round him, to things without: that he found the mind of

satisfying to itself, and suitable to its own best ends and desires,

world could do for us; and t ough the greatness, the authority,

bition, our particular pride, avarice, vanity, and sensuality; all
which, being the mere roduct of the worst part of man, were in
themselves crimes, an had in them the seeds of all manner of
crimes; but neither were related to, nor concerned with, any of
those virtues that constituted us wise men, or of those graces
that distinguished us as Christians; that being now deprived of
all the fancied felicity which he enjoyed in the full exercise of
all those vices, he said he was at leisure to look upon the dark
side of them, where he found all manner of deformity, and was
now convinced that virtue only makes a man truly wise, rich,
and great, and preserves him in the way to a superior happiness
in a future state; and in this, he said, they were more happy in
their banishment than all their enemies were, who had the full
possession of all the wealth and power they had left behind
them. Nor, sir, says he, do I bring my mind to this politically,
by the necessity of my circumstances, which some call miser-
able; but, if I know any thing of myself, I would not now go
back, though the czar my master should call me, and reinstate
me in all my former grandeur: I say, I would no more go back
to it than I believe my soul, when it shall be delivered from this
prison of the body, and has had a taste of the glorious state

crime of human affairs.
He spoke this with so much warmth in his temper, so much
earnestness and motion of his spirits, that it was evident it was
the true sense of his soul; there was no room to doubt his sin-
cerity. I told him I once thought myself a kind of monarch in
my old station, of which I had given him an account; but that
I thought he was not only a monarch, but a great conqueror.
for that he that has got a victory over his own exorbitant desires,
and the absolute dominion over himself, whose reason entirely
governs his will, is certainly greater than he that conquers a
city. But, my lord, said I, s all I take the liberty to ask you a
question ?—With all my heart, sa s he. If the door of your
liberty was opened, said I, woul you not take hold of it to
deliver you from this exile ?—Hold, said he, your question is
lubtile, and requires some serious, just distinctions, to give it a
sincere answer; and I will give it you from the bottom of my
heart. Nothing that I know of in this world. wnuld move me
to deliver myself from this state of banishment, except these
4 32 ADVENTUR ES OI
warmer climate: but I protest to you, that to go back to the
pomp of the court, the glory, the power, the hurry ofa minister
of state; the wealth, the gaiety, and the pleasures of a courtier;
' if my master should send me word this moment that he restores
me to all he banished me from, I protest, if I know myself at
all, I would not leave this wilderness, these deserts, and these
frozen lakes, for the palace at Moscow.—But, my lord, said I,
perhaps you not only are banished from the pleasures of the
court, and from the power, authority, and wealth you enjoyed
before, but you may be absent too from some of the conve-
4 32 ADVENTUR ES OI
plundered; and, the supplies left you here may not be suitable
to the ordinary demands of life.—Ay, says he, that is as you
suppose me to be a lord, or a prince, &c. ; so, indeed, I am; but
you are now to consider me only as a man, a human creature,
not at all distinguished from another; and so I can suffer no
want, unless I should be visited with sickness and distempers.
However, to put the question out of dispute, you see our man-
4 32 ADVENTUR ES OI
retired, as suited to a state of banishment; we have something
rescued from the shipwreck of our fortunes, which keeps us from
the mere necessity of hunting for food; but the poor soldiers,
who are here without that help, live in as much plenty as we,
who go into the woods and catch sables and foxes: the labour
of a month will maintain them a year; and, as the way of living
4 32 ADVENTUR ES OI
So that objection is out of doors.
I have not room to give a full account of the most agreeable
conversation I had with this truly great man; in all which he
showed that his mind was so inspired with a superior knowledge
of things, so supported by religion, as well as by a vast share of
wisdom, that his contempt of the world was really as much as
he had expressed, and-that he was always the same to the last,
as will appear in the story I am going to tell.
I had been here eight months, and a dark, dreadful winter I
thought it; the cold so intense that I could not so much as look
abroad without being wrapped in furs, and a mask of fur before
my face, or rather a hood, with only a hole for breath, and two
for sight: the little daylight we had was, as we reckoned, for

did not much care for the last. We had a good stock of tea,
with which we treated our friends, as above, and we lived very
cheerfully and well, all things considered.
It was now March, the days grown considerably longer, and
the weather at least tolerable; so the other travellers began to
prepare sledges to carry them over the snow, and to get things

for Archangel, and not for Muscovy or the Baltic, I made no
motion; knowing very well that the ships from the south do
not set out for that part of the world till May or June, and that
if I was there by the beginning of August, it would be as soon
as any ships would be ready to go away; and therefore I made
no haste to be gone, as others did: in a word, I saw a great
many people, nay, all the travellers, go away before me. It
seems, every year they go from thence to Muscovy for trade,
viz. to carry furs, and buy necessaries, which they bring back
with them to furnish their shops: also others went on the same
errand to Archangel; but then they all being to come back
again, above eight hundred miles, went all out before me.
In the month of May I began to make all ready to pack up;
and, as I was doing this, it occurred to me that, seeing all these
people were banished by the Czar of Muscovy to Siberia, and
yet, when the came there, were left at liberty to go whither
they would, why they did not then go away to any 'part of the

condition we are in; especially the generality of the people who
are banished hither. We are surrounded with stronger things
than bars or bolts: on the north side an uunavigable ocean,
where ship never sailed, and boat never swam; every other
way, we have above a thousand miles to pass through the czar’s
own dominions, and by ways utterly im assable, except by the
roads made by the government, an through the towns
garrisoned by his troops; so that we could neither pass undis
covered by the road, nor subsist any other way: so that it is in
vain to attempt it. '
l was silenced, indeed, at once, and found that they were in
a prison every jot as secure as if they had been locked up in the
castle at Moscow: however, it came into my thoughts that
I might certainly be made an instrument to procure the escape
of this excellent person; and that, whatever hazard I ran',
I would certainly try if I could carry him off. Upon this I took
an occasion, one evening, to tell him my thoughts. I repre-
sented to him that it was very easy for me to carry him away,
there being no guard 0v er him in the country; and as I was not
going to Moscow, but to Archangel, and that [went in the
retinue of a caravan, by which I was not obliged to lie in the
stationary towns in the desert, but could encamp every night
where I would, we might easily pass uninterrupted to Arch-
angel, where I would immediately secure him on board an
English ship, and carry him safe along with me; and as to his
subsistence, and other particulars, it should be my care, till he
could better supply himself.
He heard me very attentively, and looked earnestly on me
all the while I spoke; nay,l could see in his very face that
what I said put his spirits into an exceeding ferment: his colour
{34 ADVENTURES OF
that it might be even perceived in his countenance; nor could
he immediately answer me when I had done, and as it were
hesitated what he would say to it: but after he had paused a
little, he embraced me, and said, How unhappy are we, un-
guarded creatures as we are, that even our greatest acts of
friendship are made snares unto us, and we are made tempters
of one another! My dear friend, said he, your offer is so sin-
cere, has such kindness in it, is so disinterested in itself, and is
so calculated for my advantage, that I must have very little
knowledge of the world if I did not both wonder at it, and ac-
knowledge the obligation I have upon me to you for it. But did
you believe I was sincere in what I have often said to you of
my contempt of the world ? Did you believe I spoke my very
soul to you, and that I had really obtained that degree of felicity
here that had placed me above all that the world could ive me?
Did you believe I was sincere when I told you I would not go
back, if I was recalled even to be all that I once was in the
court, with the favour of the czar my master? Did you believe
me, my friend, to be an honest man; or did you believe me to
be a boasting hypocrite? Here he stopped, as if he would hear
what I would say; but, indeed, I soon after perceived that he
stopped because his s irits were in motion, his great heart was
full of struggles, andp he could not go on. I was, I confess,
astonished at the thing as well as at the man, and I used some
arguments with him to urge him to set himself free; that he
night to look upon this as a door 0 ened by Heaven for his de
liverance, and a smnmons by Provi ence, who has the care and
disposition of all events, to do himself good, and to render him-
self useful in the world.
He had by this time recovered himself: How do you know,
sir, says he, warmly, but that, instead of a summons from
Heaven, it may be a feint of another instrument; representing
in alluring colours to me the show of felicity as a deliverance,
which may in itself be my snare, and tend directly to my ruin!
Here I am free from the temptation of returning to m former
miserable greatness; there I am not sure but that all t e seeds
of pride, ambition, avarice, and luxury, which I know remain in
nature, may revive and take root, and, in a word, again overwhelm
me; and then the ha p prisoner, whom ou see now master of
his soul’s liberty, sha e the miserable s ave of his own senses,
in the full of all personal liberty. Dear sir, let me remain in this
ROBINSON CRUSOE. ‘35
purchase a show of freedom at the expense of the liberty of my
reason. and at the future happiness which I now have in my
view, but shall then, I fear, quickly lose sight of: for I am but
ROBINSON CRUSOE. ‘35
likely to possess and overthrow me as any man: 0 be not my
friend and tempter both together!
If I was surprised before, I was quite dumb now, and stood
silent, looking at him, and, indeed, admiring what I saw. The
struggle in his soul was so great, that though the weather was
extremely cold, it put him into a most violent sweat, and I found
he wanted to give vent to his mind; so I said a word or two, that
I would leave him to consider of it, and wait on him again, and
then I withdrew to my own apartment.
About two hours after, I heard somebody at or near the door
of my room, and I was going to open the door, but he had opened
it and came in. My dear friend, says he, you had almost
overset me, but I am recovered. Do not take it ill that I do not
close with your offer; I assure on it is not for want of sense or
the kindness of it in you; and came to make the most sincere
acknowledgment of it to you; but I hope I have got the victory
over myself—My lord, said I, I hope you are full satisfied that
you do not resist the call of Heaven—Sir, sai be, if it had

in the parting, that you shall leave me an honest man still,
though not a free man.
I had nothing to do but to acquiesce, and make professions
to him of my having no end in it but a sincere desire to serve
him. He embraced me ver passionately, and assured me he
was sensible of that, and s ould always acknowledge it; and

indeed, for me to accept from a man in his circumstances, and
I would have avoided them, but he would not be refused.
The next morning I sent my servant to his lordship with a
small present of tea, and two pieces of China damask, and four
little wedges of Japan gold, which did not all weigh above six
ounces or thereabout, but were far short of the value of his
sables, which, when I came to England, I found worth near
two hundred pounds. He accepted the tea, and one piece of
5136 ADVENTURES OF
stamp upon it, of the Japan coinage, which I found he took for
the rarity of it, but would not take any more; and he sent word
by my servant that he desired to speak with me.
When I came to him, he told me I knew what had passed
between us, and hoped I would not move him any more in that
affair; but that, since I had made such a generous offer to him,
he asked me if 1 had kindness enough to offer the same to
another person that he would name to me, in whom he had a
great share of concern. I told him that I could not say I
inclined to do so much for any but himself, for whom I had a
particular value, and should have been glad to have been the
instrument of his deliverance; however, if he would please to
name the person to me, I would give him my answer. He told
me it was his only son; who, though I had not seen him, yet
he was in the same condition with himself, and above two
hundred miles from him, on the other side the Oby ; but that, if
I consented, he would send for him.
e I made no hesitation, but told him I would do it. I made
some ceremony in letting him understand that it was wholly on
his account; and that seeing I could not prevail on him, I would
show my respect to him by my concern for his son: but these
things are too tedious to repeat here. He sent awa the next
day for his son; and in about twenty days he came ack with
the messenger, bringing six or seven horses loaded with very
rich furs, and which, in the whole, amounted to a ver great
value. His servants brought the horses into the town, ut left
the young lord at a distance till night, when he came incognito
into our apartment, and his father presented him to me, and, in
short, we concerted the manner of our travelling, and every thing
proper for the journey.
I had bought a considerable uantity of sables, black fox-skins,
5136 ADVENTURES OF

particular for the cloves and nutmegs, of which I sold the
greatest part here, and the rest afterward at Archangel, for a

here.
It was the beginning of June when I left this remote place, a
city, I believe, little heard of in the world; and, indeed, it is so
far out of the road of commerce, that I know not how it should
be much talked of. We were now reduced to a very small
caravan, having only thirty-two horses and camels in all, and all
of them passed for mine, though my new guest was proprietor
of eleven of them: it was most natural also that I should take
more servants with me than I had before; and the young lord
passed for my steward: what great man I passed for in 'self
I know not, neither did it concern me to inquire. We had ere
the worst and the largest desert to pass over that we met with
in our whole journey ; I call it the worst, because the way was
very deep in some places, and very uneven in others; the best
we had tosay for it was, that we thought we had no troops of
'l‘artars or robbers to fear, and that they never came on this
side the river Oby, or at least but very seldom; but we found
it otherwise.
My young lord had a faithful Muscovite, or rather a Siberian
servant, who was erfectly acquainted with the country, and led
us by private r0 s, so that we avoided coming into the prin~
cipal towns and cities upon the great road, such as Tumen,
Soloy Kamskoi, and several others ; because the Muscovite
garrisons which are kept there are very curious and strict in
their observation upon travellers, and searching lest any of the
banished persons of note should make their escape that way
into Muscovy; but by this means, as we were kept out of the
cities, so our whole journey was a desert, and we were obliged
to encamp and lie in our tents, when we might have had very
good accommodation in the cities on the way : this the young
lord was so sensible of, that he would not allow us to lie abroad
when we came to several cities on the way, but lay abroad him-
self, with his servant, in the woods, and met us always at the
appointed places.
We were just entered Europe, having passed the river Kama,
which in these parts is the boundary between Europe and Asia,

skoi, which is as much as to say, the great city on the river
Kama; and here we thought to see some evident alteration in
the people; but we were mistaken : for as we had a vast desert
to pass, which is near seven hundred miles long in some places,
but not above two hundred miles over where we passed it, so,
till we came past that horrible place, we found very little differ-
ence between that country and the Mogul Tartary : the people
are mostly pagans, and little better than the savages of America;
their houses and towns full of idols, and their way of living
wholly barbarous. except in the cities, as above, and the villager
near them, where they are Christians, as they call themselves,
of the Greek church; but have their religion mingled with so
many relics of superstition, that it is scarce to be known in some
places from mere sorcery and witchcraft.
In passing this forest, I thought, indeed, we must (after all our
dangers were to our imagination escaped, as before) have been
plundered and robbed, and perhaps murdered, by a troop of
thieves: of what country they were I am yet at a loss to know,
but they were all on horseback, carried bows and arrows, and
{38 ADVENTURES or
us as to be within two musket shots, and asking no questions,
surrounded us with their horses, and looked very earnestly
upon us twice: at length they placed themselves just in our
Way; upon which we drew up in a little line, before our camels,
being not above sixteen men in all ; and being drawn up thus,
we halted, and sent out the Siberian servant, who attended his
lord, to see who they were: his master was the more willing to
let him go, because he was not a little apprehensive that they
were a Siberian troop sent out after him. The man came up
{38 ADVENTURES or
though he spoke several of their languages, or dialects of Ian-
guages rather, he could not understand a word they said: how-
ever, after some signs to him not to come nearer to them, at his
peril, the fellow came back no wiser than he went: only that by
their dress, he said, he believed them to be some Tartars of
Kalmuck, or of the Circassian hordes, and that there must be
more of them upon the great desert, though he had never heard
that any of them were seen so far north before.
About an hour after, they again made a motion to attack us,
and rode round our little wood to see where they might break
{38 ADVENTURES or
again ; and we resolved not to stir for that night.
This was small comfort to us; however, we had no remedy:
there was on our left hand, at about a quarter of a mile distance,
a little grove, and very near the road; I immediately resolved
we should advance to those trees, and fortify ourselves as well
{38 ADVENTURES or
in a great measure cover us from their arrows ; and, in the
next lace, they could not come to charge us in a body: it was,
indee , my old Portuguese pilot who proposed it, and who had
this excellency attending him, that he was always readiest and
most apt to direct and encourage us in cases of the most danger.
We advanced immediately, with what speed we could, and gained
that little wood; the Tartars, or thieves, for we knew not what
to call them, keeping their stand, and not attempting to hinder
us. When we came thither, we found, to our great satisfaction,
that it was a swampy piece of ground, and on the one side n
very great spring of water, which running out in a little brook
was, a little farther, joined by another of the like size; and was,
In short, the source of a considerable river, called afterwards the
Wirtska: the trees which grew about this spring were not above
two hundred, but very large, and stood pretty thick, so that as
soon as we got in we saw ourselves perfectlv safe from the
enemy, unless the attacked us on foot.
While we staye here waiting the motion of the enemy some
hours, without perceiving they made any movement, our Por-
tuguese, with some help, out several arms of trees half off, and
laid them hanging across from one tree to another, and in a
manner fenced us in. About two hours before night they came
down directly upon us: and though we had not perceived it,
we found they had been joined by some more of the same, so
that they were near fourscore horse; whereof, however, we
fancied some were women. They came on till they were within

ball, and called to them in the Russian tongue to know what
they wanted, and bade them keep off : but they came on with
a double fury up to the wood side, not imagining we were so
barricaded that they could not easily break in. Our old pilot
was our captain, as well as our engineer, and desired us not to

to take good aim: we bade him give the word of command,
which he delayed so long, that they were some of them within

we killed fourteen of them, and woun ed several others, as also
several of their horses ; for we had all of us loaded our pieces
with two or three bullets at least.

immediately about one hundred rods from us, in which time we
loaded our pieces again, and seeing them keep that distance,
ROBINSON CRUSOE. 439
riders we supposed were killed: and coming up to the dead, we
judged they were Tartars, but knew not how they came to make
an excursion of such an unusual length.
We slept little, you may be sure, but spent the most part of
the night in strengthening our situation, and barricading the
entrances into the wood, and keeping a strict watch. We waited
for daylight, and when it came, it gave us a very unwelcome
discover , indeed: for the enemy, who we thought were dis-
courage with the reception they met with, were now greatly
increased, and had set up eleven or twelve huts or tents, as if
they were resolved to besiege us: and this little camp they had
pitched upon the open plain, about three quarters of a mile
from us. We were, indeed, surprised at this discovery; and now,
I confess, I gave myself over for lost, and all that I had; the loss

hazards as I had gone through, and even in sight of our port,
where we expected safety an deliverance. As to my partner,
he was raging, and declared that to lose his goods would be his
ruin, and that he would rather die than be starved; and he was

that we were able to resist them all in the situation we were then
in; and thus we spent the day in debates of what we should do:
but towards evening we found that the number of our enemies
still increased, and we did not know but by the morning they
might be a still greater number: so I began to inquire of those
people we had brought from Tobolski, if there were no private
ways, by which we might avoid them in the night, and perhaps
retreat to some town, or get help to guard as over the desert.

brave enough, by what he had showed already; but that his
lord knew better than to desire seventeen or eighteen men to

to it; and that, if he thought it possible for us to escape in the
night, we had nothing else to do but to attempt it. He answered,
if his lordship gave him such orders he would lose his life if he
did not perform it: we soon brought his lord to give that order,
though privately, and we immediately prepared for the putting
it in practice.
'i 40 ADVENTURES O?
our little camp, which we kept burning, and prepared so as to
make it burn all night, that the 'l‘artars might conclude we were
still there; but as soon as it was dark, and we could see the
stars (for our guide would not stir before), having all our horses
and camels ready loaded, we followed our new guide, who I soon
found steered himself by the north star.
After we had travelled two hours very hard, it began to be
lighter still; not that it was quite dark all night, but the moon
began to rise, so that, in short, it was rather lighter than we
wished it to be; but by six o'clock the next morning we were
got above thirty miles, having alm0st spoiled our horses. Here
we found a Russian village, named Kcrmazinskoy, where we
rested, and heard nothing of the Kalmuck 'l'artars that day
About two hours before night we set out again, and travelled
till eight the next morning, though not quite so hard as before;
and about seven o'clock we passed a little river, called Kirtza,
and came to a good large town inhabited by Russians, called
Ozomoys: there we heard that several troops of Kalrnucks had
been abroad upon the desert, but that we were now completely
out of danger of them, which was to our great satisfaction.
Here we were obliged to get some fresh horses; and having

happily, near the end of our travels by land, that river being
navigable, in seven days' passage, to Archangel. From hence
we came to Lawrenskoy the 3d of July; and providing ourselves
with two luggage boats, and a barge for our own convenience,
we embarked the 7th, and arrived all safe at Archangel the 18th;

including our stay of eight months at 'l‘obolski. We were
obliged to stay at this place six weeks for the arrival of the
ships, and must have tarried longer, had not a Hamburgher
come in above a month sooner than any of the English ships:
when, after some consideration that the city of Hamburgh might
happen to be as good a market for our goods as London, we all

the time we stayed there; and this he did that he might not be
seen in the city, where some of the Moscow merchants would
certainly have seen and discovered him.
We then set sail from Archangel the 20th of August, the same
year; and after no extraordinary bad voyage, arrived safe in the
Elbe the 18th of September. Here my partner and I found a
very good sale for our goods, as well those of China as the
sables, &c. of Siberia; and dividing the produce, my share

to seek protection, and could correspond with those of his
father’s friends who Were left alive. He did not part without
testimonies of gratitude for the service I had done him, and his
