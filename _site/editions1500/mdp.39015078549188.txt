PREFACE.
IF ever the story as any private man*s ad-
ventures in the world were worth making
public, and were acceptable when published,
the Editor of this account thinks this will
be so.
The wonders of this man's life exceed all
that (he thinks) is to be found extant; the
life of cme man being scarce capable of a
greater variety.
The story is told with modesty, with scri-*
ousness, and with a religious application of
events to the uses to which wife men always
apply them, vi£. to the instruction of others
by this example, and to justify and honour the
wisdom of Providence in all the variety of our
circumstances, let them happen how they will.
The editor believes this narrative to be a just
history of fact; neither is there any appear*,
ance of fiction it: and though he is well
aware there are many* who on account of the
Very singular preservations the author met
A 2
with, will give it the name of romance; yet,
in which ever of these lights it shall be view-
ed, he imagines, that the improvement of it,
as well as the diversion, as to the instruction of
the reader, will be the seme; and as such, he
thinks, without farther compliment to the
world, he does them a great service in the'pu-
blication.
LIFE AND ADVENTURES
> OF
ROBINSON CRUSOE.
I was born at York, in the year 1632, of a reputable fa-
mily. My father was a native of Bremen, who by
merchandizing at Hull for sometime, gained a very plen-'
tiful fortune. He married my mother at York, who re-
ceived her first breath in that.country : and as her maiden
name was Robinson, I was called Robinson Krcni%iiaer:
which not being easily pronounced in the English tongue,
we are commonly known by the name of Crusoe.
I was the youngest of three brothers. The eldest was a
lieutenant, colonel in Lockhart*s regiment, but stain by the
Spaniards: what became of the other, I could never learn.
No charge or pains were wanting in my education.—
My father designed me for the law; yet nothing would serve
me but I must go to sea, both against the will of my fa^
ther, the tears of my mother, and the entreaties of friends.
One morning my father expostulated very warmly with me:
What reason, fays he, have you to leave your native coun-
try, where there must be a more certain prospect of con-
tent and happiness, to enter into a wandering condition of
uneasiness and uncertainty? He recommended to me
Augur's wish, "Neither to desire poverty nor riches :'*
that a middle state of life was the most happy, and thai;
the high towering thoughts of raising our condition bywan-
dering abroad, were surrounded with misery and danger,
and often ended with confusion and cTisappointment. I en-
treat you, nay, 1 command you, (fays he) to desist from
these intentions. Consider your elder brother, who laid
down his life for his honour, or rather lost it for his disobe-
dience to my will. If you will go (added he) my prayers
/hall however be offered for your preservation; but a time
may come, when, desolate, oppreslfcd; or forsaken*-you
A 3
may wim you had taken your poor despised' fathers coun-
sel.—He pronounced these words with such a moving and
paternal eloquence, while floods of tears ran down his aged
cheeks, that it seemed to stem the torrent of my resolutions.
But this soon wore off, and a little after I informed my mo-
ther, that I could not settle to any business, my resolutions
were so strong to see the world; and begged she would gam
my father's consent only to go one voyage; which, if 1 did
not prove prosperous, I would never attempt a second. But
my desire was as vain as my folly in asking. My mother
passionately expressed her dislike of.this proposal, telling me,
4C That as ihe saw I was bent upon my own destruction,
<f contrary to their will and my duty, she would fay no
** more, but leave me to myself to do whatever I pleased."
I was then, 1 think, nineteen years old, when one time
being at Hull, I met a school-fellow of mine, going along
with his father., who was master of a ship, to London; and
acquainted him with my wandering desires; he assured me
of a free passage, and a plentiful mare of what was neces-
sary. Thus, without imploring a blessing, or taking fare-
wel of my parents, I took shipping on the first of Septem-
ber 1651. We set sail soon aster, and our (hip had scarce
left the Humber a-stern, when there arose so violent a storm,
that, being extremely sea-sick, [concluded the judgment
of God deservedly followed me for my disobedience to my
dear parents. It was then I called to mind the good ad-
vice of my father; how easy and comfortable was a mid-
dk^state of life; and 1 firmly resolved, if it pleased God
to set me on dry land once more, I would return to my
parents, implore their forgivtness, and bid a final adieu to
my wandering inclinations.
Such were*my thoughts while the storm continued; but
these good resolutions decreased with the danger; more,
especially when my companion cam£ to me, clapping me
on the moulder: "What, Bob!" said he, "sure you was
"not frightened last night with scarce a capful of wind '?'*—
"And do you,'"' cried I, u call such a violent storm a cap-
«« fulof wind?" " A storm, you fool you," said he, "this
"is nothing; a good ship and sea-room always bafrtes such
« a foolish squall of wind as that': But you're a fresli wa~
« ter sailor: Come boy, turn cut, Tee what sine weather we
"have now, and a good bowl of punch Will drown all your
"past sorrows." In short, the punch was made, I "was
&ruak; and in one iyghtYtime drowned both my repeat-
atfce arid my good resolutions, forgetting entirely the vows
and promises I made in my dill reis: and whenever any re-
flections would return on me,-what by company* and what
by drinking, I soon mastered those sits, as I der^dingly
called them. But this only made way for another trial,
whereby I could not but fee how much I was beholden to
kind Providence.
Upon the sixth day we came "to an'anchor in Harwich
road, where we lay wind-bound with some Newcastle flips;
and there being, good anchorage, and our cables iound, the
seamen forgot their late toil and danger, and spent the time
as merry as if they had been on shore;' But on the eighth
day there arose a brisk gale of'wind, which prevented our
tiding it up the river; and-fl.ill increasing,- our ship -rde
forecastle in, and shipped several large, seas."
It was not long before horror seized the seamen them-
selves, and I heard the mailer express this'melancholy eja-
clation, " Lord have mercy upon us, we shall be all lost:
t( and undoneI" For my parr, sick unto death, 1 kept my
cabin till the universal and terribly dreadful apprehensions
of our speedy fate made me get upon deck; and there I
was affrighted indeed. The sea went mountains high: I*
could fee nothing but distress around us; two mips had cut
their masts on board, and another was foundered; two more
that had lost their anchors,were forced out to the mercy of
the ocean i and to save our lives we were forced to cut our
foremast and mainmast'quite away.
Who is there so ignorant as not to judge of my dreadful
condition? I was but a freshwater sailor, and therefore it
seemed more terrible. Our snip, was very good, but over-
loaded; which made the stiilors often cryout, " She would
"sounder .!" Words I then was ignorant of. All this
while the storm continuing, and rather increasing, the "ma-
ster and the most sober partis his men went to prayers, ex-
pecting death every moment. -Jrrthe middle of the night
one cried out, « We had sprung a leak;7' another,fc That
"there was four feet water in the hold." I was just'ready
to expire with fear, when immediately all,hands were call-
ed to the pump; and the men forced me also in that ex-
tremity to share with thsm in their labour. While thus era-
ployedi the master espying some light colliers, sired a gun
as a signal of distress; and I, not understanding what it
meant, and thinking that either the ship broke, or some
dreadful thing, happened, fell into a swoon. £ven in that
. • "a 4' -' --;•-  -'
common condition'of w.o, nobody minded me, excepting
to tnrust me aside with their feet, tVinkingW deacT/ and it
was a great while before I recovered.
Happy it was for us, when, upon the signal given, they
ventured out their bbats to save our lives. Ail bur pump-
ing had been in vain, and vain had. all our attempt been,
had they not come to our (hip's fide, and our men cast them -
a Vope over the stern with a buoy to it, whlcK after great
labour they got hold of, and wehauling them upto us goti/i-
to their boat, and left our ship, which we perceived fink
within less than a quarter of an hour; and tfius I learned
what was meant by foundering at fia. And now the men
inceslantly laboured to recover their own ship; but the sea
ran so high, and the wind blew so hard, that they thought It
convenient to hale within shore; w^hich, with great diffi-
culty and danger, ar last we happily effected, landing at
a place called Crcmer, not far from Winrerton light house;
from whence we all walked to Yarmouth, where, as ob-
jects of pity, many good people furnished us-with necessa-
ries to carry us either to Hull or London.
Strange, after all this, like the prodigal son, I did not
return to my father; who, hearing of the (hip's calamity,
for a lonpr time thought me entombed in the dctp: No
doubt but I mould \\k\z soared on his fatted calf, as the scrip-
Hue expressethit; but my ill fate still puihed'me on, in
fpittefthe powerful convictions of reason and conscience.
^ When we had been at Yarmouth three days, [ met my
old companion, who had given me the invitation to go on
board along withhis father. His behaviour and speech
were altered, and in a melancholy manner asked me how I
did., telling his father who I was, and how I had made this
voyage only for a trial to proceed further abroad. Upon
which the old gentleman turning to me gravely, said,
u Young man, you ought never to goto sea any more, but
*' to take this for a certain sign that you never will prosper
u in a seafaring condition." «« Sir," answered I, « will
*« you take the fame resolution?" <{ It is a different cafe,"
said he, "it is my calling, and consequently my duty;
<( but as you have made this voyage for a trial, you fee
xi what ill success Heaven has set before your eyes; and
''perhaps our miseries have been on your account, like
"Jonah in the (hip of Tarjhijb. But pray what are you, and
"on what account did you go to sea?" Upon which I
vtry freely declared my whole story; at the end of which
he made this exclamation: €t Ye sacred powers: what had I
c; committed, that such a wretch should enter into my ship
** to heap upon me such a deluge of miseries J." But soon re-
colleaing his passion, *c Young man," said he, "if you
u do* not go back, depend upon it, wherever you go, you
4( will meet with disasters and disappointments till your fa-
"ther's words are fulfilled upon you." And so we parted.
Ithought at first to return home; but shame opposed
that good motion, as thinking I should be laughed at by
my neighbours and acquaintance. So strange is the na-
ture of youth, who are not ashamed to fin, but yet ashamed
to repent; and so far from being ashamed of those actions
for which they may be accounted fools, they think it folly
to return to their duty, which is the principal mark of wis-
dom. In short, I travelled up to London, resolving upon
a voyage; and a voyage I soon heard of, by my acquaint-
ance with a captain who took a fancy to me, to go to the
coast of Guinea. Having some money, and appearing like
a gentleman, i went on board, not as a common sailor or
foremast man; nay, the commander agreed I should go
that voyage with him without any expence; that I mould
be his messmate and companion, and I was very welcome
to carry any thing with me, and make the best merchan-
dise I could.
I blessed my happy fortune, and humbly thanked my
captain for this offer; and acquainting my friends in York-
shire, forty pounds were sent me, the greatest part of which
my dear father and mother contributed to, with which I
bought toys and trifles, as the captain directed me. My
captain also taught me navigation, how to keep an account
of the ship's course, take an observation, and led me into
the knowledge of several useful branches of the mathema-
tics. And indeed this voyage made me both a sailor and
a merchant; for 1 brought home five pounds nine ounces
of gold-dust for my adventure, which produced, at my
return to London, almost three hundred pounds. But in
this voyage I was extremely sick, being thrown into a vio-
lent calenture through the excessive heat, trading upon the
coast from the latitude ojf fifteen degrees north, even to the
line itself.
- But alas! my dear friend the captain soon departed this
life after his arrival. This was a sensible grief to me; yet
I resolved to go another voyage with his mate, who had
now got command' of the ship. This proved a very u-i-
successful one; for though I did not carry quite a hundred
pounds of my late acquired wealth, ;fo that I had t.\yo
hundred pounds left, which i reposed with the captain's
widow, who was an honest gentlewoman) yet my misfor-
tunes in this unhappy voyage were very great. For our
ship sailing towards the Canary islands, we were chased by
a Salee rover; and in spite of all the haste we could make,
by crowding as much canvas as our yards could spread, or
our masts carry, the pirate gained upon us, so that we pre-
pared ourselves to fight. They had eighteen guns, and
we had but twelve. About three in the afternoon there was
a desperate engagement, wherein many were killed and
wounded on both sides; but finding ourselves overpowered
with numbers, our ihip disabled, and ourselves too impo-
tent to have the least hopes-of success, we were forced to
surrender; and accordingly were all carried prisoners into
the port of Salee. Our men were sent to the Emperor's
court to be fold there; but the pirate captain taking notice
of me, kerSt me tp be his own slave.
In this condition, I thought myself the most miserable
creature on earth, and the prophecy of my father came
afresh into my thoughts. However, roy condition was
better than J thought it to be* as will soon appear. Some
hopes indeed I had that my new patron would go to sea
again, where he might be taken by a Spanisn or Portu-
guese man of war, and then 1 should be set at liberty. But
in this I was mistaken; for he never took me with him,
but left me to look after his little garden, and do the drud-
gery of his house, and when he returned from sea, would
make me lie in the cabin, and look after the (hip. I had
no one that I could communicate my thoughts to, which
were continually meditating my escape; no Englishman,
Irishman, or Scotchman here, but myself; and for two
years I could see nothing practicable, but only pleased my-
self with the imagination.
After some length of time, my patron, as I found, grew
so poor that he could not.fit out his ihip as usual; and then
he used constantly, once or twice a week, if the weather
was fair, to go opt a fishing, taking me and a young Mq-
rescoboy to row the boat; and so much pleased was he^ with
me for my dexterity in catching the fish, that he would of-
ten send me with a Moor, who was one of his kinsmen, and
the Moresco youth, to catch a dish of fish for him.
One morning, as. we were at the sport, there arose such
a thick fog, that we lost sight of the shore; ami rawing we
knew not which way, we laboured all the night, and in the
morning sound ourselves in the ocean, two leagues from
land. However, we attained there at length, and made
the greater haste, because our stomachs were exceedingly-
sharp and hungry. In order to prevent such disasters for
the future, my patron ordered a carpenter to build a little
state room or cabin in the middle of the long-boat, with a
place behind it to steer and hale home the main sheet, with
other conveniences to keep him from the weafher, as also
lockers to put in all manner of provisions, with a handsome
shoulder, os mutton fail, gibing over the cabin.
In this he frequently took us out a fishing; and one
time inviting t>vo or three persons of distinction to go with
him, made provision extraordinary, providing also tl*ree v
fusees with powder and shot, that they might have some
sport at fowling along the sea-coast.- The next morning
the boat, was made clean, her ancient and-pendants out, .
and every thing ready; but their minds altering, my pa-
tron ordered us to go a fishing, for that his, guests would *
certainly sup with him that night.
And now I began to think of my deliverance indeed. la
order to this I persuaded the Moor to get some provisions
on board, as not daring to.meddle with our patron's; and
he taking my advice, we stored ourselves with ruik biscuit,
and three jars- of water* Besides, 1 privately conveyed
into the boat a,bottle of brandy, some twine, thread, a
hammer, hatchet, and a saw*; and,-in particular, some
bees-wax., which wa£ a great comfort to me, and served to
make candles. I then persuaded MuJey .(for so was the
Moor called) to procure some powder and stipe, pretend-
ing tp kill sea curleus, which he innocently and readily
agreed to. In sliort, being provided with all things neces-
sary, we sailed outrresolving for my own part to make my
escape, though it should cost me my.life. .
When.we had pasted the castle, we fell a fishing; but:
though I knew there, was a bite, I dissembled the matter,
in order tcvput out further to sea. Accordingly we ran a
league further; when giving the boy the helm, and pre-
tending *o stoop, for something, I seized Muley by surprise
and threw* him overboard. As he was an excellent swim-
mer:, he soon arose, and made towards the boat; upon
which, I took out a fusee, and presented at him ; " Muley,"
said I,<s I never yet designed to do you any harm, and
A 6 and
ci seek nothing now but my redemption, I know you are
u able enough to swim to more, and save your life; but
si if you 2re resolved to follow me to the endangering os
*' mine, the very moment you proceed, I will shoot you
"through the head." The harmless creature at these
Mordfj turned himself from me, and I make no doubt got
safe to land. Then turning to the bey Xury, I perceived
he trembled at the action; but I put him ont of all fear,
telling him, that if he would be true and faithful to me, I
would do well by him. «« And therefore," said I, i( you
"-must stroke your face to be faithful; and, as the Turks
Vi have learned you, swear by Mahomet, and the beard of
"your father, or else I will throw you into the sea also*"
So innocent did the child then, look, and with such an
obliging smile consented, that 1 readily believed him, and
from that day forward began to*love him entireJy.
We then pursued our voyage.; and lest they mould think
me gone to the Straits' mouth, I kept to the southward to
the truly Barbarian coast; but, in theduik of the evening,
I changed my course, and steering directly S. and by E.
that I might keep near the shore; and having a fresti gale
of wind, with a pleasant smooth sea, by three o'clock next
day I was one hundred and fifty miles beyond the Em-
peror of Morocco's dominions. Yet still having the
dreadful apprehension of being retaken, I continued soiling
for rive dsys successively, till such time as the wind shift-
ing to the southward, made me conclude, that if any ves-
sel was in the chafe of me, they would proceed no farther.
After so much fatigue and thought, I anchored at the
mouth of a little river, I knew not what or where; nei-
ther did I then see any people. What I principally wanted
was fresh water; and I was resolved about dusk .to swim.
ashore. But no sooner did the gloomy clouds of night be-
gin to succeed the declining day, when we heard such bark-
ing, roaring, and howling of wild creatures, that one might
have thought the very strongest monsters of nature, or in-
fernal spirits had their residence there. Poor Xury, al-
most dead with fear, entreated me not to go on shore that
night. "Supposing I don't, Xury," said I, '' and in the
"morning we should see men who are worse than those we
'< fear, what when?" u O den we may give dem de moot
gun," replied Xury, laughing, €t and de gun make d«m
** all run away." The wit, and broken English which the
boy bad iearned among the captives of our nation, pleased
me entirely 5 and, to add to His cheerfulness, I gave him
a dram of the bottle: we could get but little sleep all
the night for those terrible howlings they made; and, in-
deed, we were 'bath very much affrighted, when, by the
rollings of the water, and other tokens, we justly concluded
one of these' monsters made towards our boat. I could not
fee till it came within two oars length, when taking my fu-
see, I let sly at him. Whether I hit him or no, 1 cannot
tell ^ but he made towards the more, and the noise of my
gun increased the stupendous noise of the monsters.
The next morning I was resolve~d to go on shore to get
fresh water, and venture my life an-.ong the beasts or sa-
vages, ihould either attack me. Xury said, he would
take one of the jars and bring me some. I ailed him,
why he would go, and not I? The poor boy answered,
"if wild mans come, they eat me, you go away. " A
mind scarcely now to be imitated, so contrary to self-pre-
servation, the most powerful law of Nature. This indeed
increased my affection to the child. "Well, dear Xury,"
said F, (f we will both go ashore, both kill wild mans, and
u they (hall eat neither of us." So giving Xury a piece
of rusk-bread to eat, and a diam, we waded ashore, car-
rying nothing with us but our arms, and two jars for wa-
ter. I did not go out of sight of the boat, as dreading
the savages coming down the river in their canoes; but the^
boy seeing a low descent or vale about a mile in the coun-
try, he wandered to it: and then running back to me with
great precipitation, 1 thought he was pursued by some sa-
vage or wild beast; upon which I approached, resolving to
peri/hor prorect him from danger. As-he came nearer to
me, I saw something hanging over his moulders, which
was^a creature he had ihot like a hare, but different in co- .
lour, and longer legs; however, we were glad of it, for it
proved wholesome and nourishing meat: but what added
to ottr joy was, my boy assured me there was plenty of wa-
ter, and that hejee nomiildmans. And greater still was
our comfort, when we found freih water in the creek where
we were when the tide was out, without going so far up
into the country.
In this place I began to consider that the Canary and
Cape de Verde islands lay not far off; but having no in-
strument, I knew not what latitude, or when to stand off
to sea Tor them; yet my hopes were, I should meet some .
of the Englisli trading vessels, who would relieve and,take
us in.
The place I was in was no-doubt that wild country, in-
habited only by a few that lies between the Emperor of
Morocco's dominions and the Negroes, it is filled, with
wild beasts, and the Moors use it for turn ting chiefly,-—
From this place 1 thought 1 saw the top of the mountain
Teneriff in the Canaries; which made me try twice to
attain it.; but as often was- I drove back? and To forced to
pursue my fortune along snore.
Early one morning we came to an anchor under a little
point of land, but pretty high; and the tide beginning to
flow, we lay ready to go further in. But Xury, whose
youthful and penetrating eyes were sharper than mine* in &
soft tone, desired me to keep-far from land, lest we (hould
be devoured. ." For look yonder, mayter/' said he,
6i and see de dreadful monster fast asleep on de side of de
"hill," Accordingly looking where he pointed, I espied a
fearful monster indeed* It was a terrible great lion that .
lay on shore, covered as it were by a (hade of a piece of
the hill. c; Xury," said I, " You shall go on ihore and
kill him." But the boy-looked amazed: u Me kill -him!"
says he, "he eat me at one mouth;" meaning one mouth-
ful. Upon which I bid him lie still, and charging my big-
gest gun with two slugs, and a good charge of powder, I
took the best aim I could to Jhoot him thro1 the head, but .
his leg lying over his nose, the flag broke his knee-bone.
The lion awaking with the pain? got up, but soon sell ,
down, giving the most hideous groan I ever heard: but .
taking my second piece, 1 shot him through the head, and .
then he lay struggling for life Upon this Xury took heart
and desired my leave to go on shore. fs Go then,5' said I.
Upon which taking a little gtun in one hand, he swam to
shore with the other, and coming close to the lion, put a
period to his life, by shooting him again through the _
head.
But this was spending our ammunition in vain, the flesh .
not being good to eat. Xury was like a champion, and
comes on board for a. hatchet, to cut off the head of his
enemy; hut; not having, strength to perform it, he cut off.
and brought me a foot. I bethought me, however, that
his ikin would be of use. This work cost Xury aiid me a
whole day; when spreading it on the top of our cabin,
the hot beams of the: fun effectually dried it in two days
time, and it afterwards served me for a bed to lie on.
And now* we- sailed southerly, living sparingly on oar
provisions, and went no oscener on shore than we were
obliged for fresh water. My deiign'was to make the river
Gambia or Senegal, or any where about t're Cape de Verde,
in hopes to meet,some European ship. If Providence did
not so favour me, my next course was to seek for the
islands, or lose my life among the Negroes. And in a
word, I put my whole stress upon this, •' Either that I
"must meet with some ship or certainly perish."
One day as we were sailing along, we saw people stand
on the shore looking at us; we could also perceive they
were black and stark naked. I was inclined to go on Ihore,
but Xury cried, " No, no;" however, I approached nearer,
and I found they run along the more by me a good way.
They had no weapons in their hands, except one, who
held a long stick, which Xury told me was a lance, with
which they could kill at a great distance. I talked to
them by signs and made them sensible I wanted some-
thing to eat; they beckoned me to /lop my boat, while
two of them ran up into the country, and in less thm half
an hour came back, and brought with them two pieces of
dried flesh, and some corn, which we kindly accepted ; and
to prevent any fears on either side, they brought the food-
to the shore, laid it down, then went and stood a great way
off till we fetched it on board, and then came close to us
again.
But while we were returning thanks to them being all
we could afford, two mighty creatures came from the moun-
tains; one as it were pursuing the other with great fury,
which we were the rather inclined to believe, as they sel-
dom appear but in the night; and both these swiftly pas-
sing by the Negroes, jumped into the sea, wantonly swijri-
ming about, as tho' the diversion of the waters had put a
stop to their fierceness. At last one of them coming nearer
to my boat than I expected or desired, I siiot him directly
through the head; upon which he funk immediately, yet.
rising again, would have willingly made the shore; but.
between the wound and the strangling of the water, he,
died before he could reach it.
It is impossible to express the consternation the poor Ne-,
groes were in at the firing of my gun; much less can. I,
mention their &rprife, when they perceived the creature to,
be slain by it. I made signs to them to draw near it with,
a. rope, and then gave it them to hale on shore. It was a
be^atiful leopard/which made me defire its skin: and the
Negroes seeming to covet the carcase, I freesy,fgave it to
them. As fer the other leopard, it made to more, ami
ran with prodigious swiftness out of sight. The Negroes
having kindly furnished me with, water, and with what
roots and grains their country afforded, I took my leave,
and, after eleven days fail, came in sight of the Cape de
Verde, and those islands called by its name. But the great
distance I was from it, and fearing contrary winds would
prevent my reaching them, I began to grow melancholy
and dejected, when, upon a sudden, Xury cried out, " Mas-
"ter! Mailer! a ship with a fail \" and looked as af-
frighted as if it was his mailer's hhip sent in search cf us.
But I soon discovered stie was a Portuguese ship, as [
thought bound to the coast of Guinea for Negroes. Upon
which I strove for life to come up to them. But vain had
it been, if through their perspective glares they had not
perceived me and shortened their fail to let me come up.
Encouraged at this, I set up my patron's ancient, and
fired a gun, both as signals of distress; upon which they
\-ery kindly lay to, so that in three hours time 1 came up
with them. They spoke to me in Portuguese, Spanish, and
French, but neither of these did I understand; till at length
a Scots sailor called, and then I told him I was an
Englishman, who had escaped fom the Moors at Sallee;
upon which they took me kindly on board, with all my
effects.
Surely none can express the inconceivable joy 1 felt at
this happy deliverance! who from being a late miserable
and forlorn creature, was not only relieved, but in favour
with the master of the ship, to whom, in return for my de-
liverance, I offered ait 1 had. ""God forbid," said he,
"that I should take any thing from you. Every thing
4f shall be delivered to you when you come to Brazil, if
(( i have saved your life, it is no more than I should ex-
*' pect to receive myself from any other, when in the fame
f< circumstances I mould happen to meet the like deliver-
•f ance. And should 1 take from you what you have, and
*« leave you at Brazil, why, this would be only taking
** away a life I had given. My charity teaches me bet-
"ter. Those effects you have will support you there, and
*< provide you a passage home again." And, indeed, he
acted with the strictest justice in what he did, taking my
things into his possession, and giving me an exact inven-
tory, even to my earthen jars. He- bought my boat of me
<< *(*>( o/ f/trtnr<r <j/toiu'/;n/ <n£pvn
for the ship's use, giving me a note of eighty pieces of
eight, payable at Brazil; and if any body offered more*
he would make it up. He also gave me sixty pieces for
my boy Xury. It was with great reluctance I was pre-
vailed upon to fell the child's liberty, who hact served me so
faithfully; butt the boy was willing himself; and it was
agreed, that faster ten years he should be made free, upon
his renouncing M3hometanifmrand embracing Christian! y.
Having a pleasant voyage to the Brazils, we arrived m
the Bay de Todos los Santos, or All Saints Bay, in twenty-
two days after. And here I cannot forget the generous
treatment of the captain. He would take nothing for my
passage, gave me twenty ducats for the leopard's Sein, and
thirty for the lion's. .Every thing he caused to be deli-
vered, and what I would fell he bought, fn short I made
about 220 pieces of my cargo; and with this.stock I en-
tered once more, as I may-fay into the scene of life.
Being recommended to an honest planter, I lived with him!
till such time as I was informed of the manner of their
planting and making sugar; and seeing how well they
lived, and how suddenly they grew rich, i was filled with
a desire to settle am< ng them and resolved to get my mo-
ney remitted to me, and to purchase a plantation.
To be brief, I bought a settlement next door to anjio-
nest,and kind neighbour, born at Lisbon, of English pa-
rents, whose pi untation joining to mine, we Lnproyed it
very amicably together. Both out stocks were low, and
for two years we planted only for food: but the third
year we planted some tobacco, and each of us dressed a.
large piece of ground the ensuing year for planting canes.
But now I found how much I wanted, assistance, and re-„
pented the loss of my dear boy Xury.
Having none to assist me, my father's words came into
my mind; and [ used to ask myself, if what I sought was
only a middle station of life, why could it not as well be ob- .
tained in England as h^ref When I pondered on this with
regret, the thoughts of my late deliveranceToribok me. I .
had none to converse with but my neighbour; no work to
be done but by my own hands; it often made me fay, my .
condition was like to that of a man cast upon a desolate
island. So unhappy are we in our reflections, so forgetful
of what good things we receive ourselves, and so unthank*
su! for our deliverance from those calamities that others
endure.
I'S LIKE AND 'A© V EN TUR E 3 -*
I was in some measure settled,before the captain wh<y-
took me up departed from the Brazils.*, One day I went to
him, and told him what stock I had in London, deiiring-
his affiiiance insetting it remitted; to which the good
gentleman readily*consented, but^would only have me fend
for half my money, lest it fhoildinifcarry; which, if it did,
I might still have the remainder to support me: and (a
taking letters of procuration of me, bid me trouble my-
self no farther about it-.
And indeed wonderful was his kindness towards me;
for he not only procured the money I had drawn for upon
my captains wido*, but feat me over a servant with a
cargo proportionable to my condition^ He also sent me
over tools-of all forts, iron-work, and utenfih necessary for
my plantation -,- which proved-to be of the greatest use to
me in roy business-.
Wealth now accumulating on mej arid uncommon suc-
cess crowmsig.my prosperous labours, I might have relied
happv in that middle state of l^fe my father had so often'
recommended-; yet nothing would content me, such was
my evil genius* but I must leave this happy station, for a
foolisti arobiton* in rising; and thus, onoe more, I cast my*
self into the greatest gulph of misery that ever poor crea*
ture fell into, Having lived four years in Brazil, I had
not only learned the language, but contracted acquaint-
ance with- the most eminent planters, and even the mer-
chants of St. Salvadore ;-,to whom, once, by way of dis-
course, having given account of my two voyages to the
coast of Guinea, and the> manner of trading there for
mere trifles, by which we furnHk our plantation* with Ne-
groes., they gave such atttention to4what I said., that three
of them came one morning to me, and told ra© they had a
secret proposal to make. Afer enjoining me to secrecy (it
being an infringement on-the powers of .the feings of Por-
tugal and Spain) they-told me they had a mind to Æt out a
ship to go to Guinea, in order-to stock the plantation with
Negroes, which as they could not be publicly fold, they
would divide among them; and if I would go their super*
cargo in the (hip, to manage the trading part, I mould
have an equal mare of the Negroes, without providing any
stock. The thing indeed was fair enough, had I been in
another condition. But 1, born to be my own destroyer,
could not resist the proposal, but accepted the offer upon
condition of their looking after my plantation. So ma^.
king a fonnal will, I bequeathed my effects to my good
friend the captain, as my universal heir; hut obliged him
to dispose of my effects as directed; one half of the produce
to himself, and the other to be shipped to England.
The ship being fitted out, and all things ready, we set
sail the first of September, 1659^ being the same day eight
yean; J left my father and mother in Yorkshire. We sailed
northward upon the coasts in order to gain Africa, till we
made Cape Augustine; from whence going farther into
the ocean, out of sight of land, we steered as though we
were bound for the isle Fernand de Norenba, leaving the
islands on the east; and then it was that we met with a
terrible tempest, which continued for twelve days successive-
ly, so that the winds carried us wheresoever they pleased.
In this perplexity one of our men died, and one man and
a boy were washed overboard. When the weather cleared
up a little, we found ourselves eleven degrees north lati-
tude, upon the coast of Guinea. Upon this the captain
gave reasons for return'ng; which 1 opposed, counselling
him to stand away for Barbadoes, which, as, I supposed,
might be attained in fifteen days, to altering our course,
we sailed north-west and by west, in order to reach the Lee-
ward Islands; but a second storm succeeding, drove us to
the westward; so that we were justly afraid of falling in-
to the hands of cruel savages, pr the paws of devouring
beasts of prey.
In this great distress, one of our men, early in the morn-
ing cried out, " Land, land!" which he had no sooner
cried out, but our ship struck upon a sand bank,and in a mo-
ment the sea broke over her in such a manner that we ex-
pected we should all have perished immediately. We
knew nothing where we were, or upon what land we were
driven; whether an island or the main, inhabited or not
inhabited; and we could not so much as hope that the ship
would hold out many minutes, without breaking in pieces,
except the wind by a miracle should turn about immedi-
ately. While we flood looking at one another, expect-
ing death every moment. The mate lays hold of the boat,
and with the help of the rest got her flung over the mip's
fide, and getting all into her, being eleven of us, commit-
ted ourselves to God's mercy and the wild sea. And now.
we saw that this last effort would not be a sufficient protec-
tion^ from death; so high did the sea rise, that it was im-
possible the boat should live. As to making fail* we had
none; neither if we had, .could we make use of any. $6
that when we had rowed, or rather were driven about a
league and a half, a raging wave* like a lofty mountain,
came rolling a-stern of us, and took us with such fury, that
at once it overset the boat, Thus beicg. swallow ed up in
a moment, we had hardly time to call upon the tremendous
name of God.j much less to implore, in dying ejaculations^
his infinite mercy to receive our departing fouls. '•::
Men are generally counted insensible, when struggling lit
the pangs of death; but while I was overwhelmed with
water, 1 had the moil dreadful apprehensions imaginable.
For the joys of heaven and the torments of hell, seemed
to present themselves before me in these dying agonies, and
even small space of time, as it were, between life and
death. I was going 1 thought I knew not whither, into
a dismal gulph unknown, and as yet unperceived, never to
behold my friends, nor the light of this world any more!
Could I even have thought of annihilation, or a total dif-
fojution of foul as-well as body, the gloomy thoughts of
having no farther being, no knowledge of what we hoped
for, but an eternal quietus, without life or fense: even that,
I fay, would have been enough to strike me with horror
and confusion! I strove, however, to the lafl extremity,
while all my companions were overpowered and entombed
in the de\ p: and it was with great dUScuIty I kept my
breath till the wrave spent itself, and retiring back, left me
on the ihore half dead with the water I had taken in. As
soon as I got on my.feet, I ran as fait as I could, led ano-
ther wave should pursue me, and carry me back again*
But for all the haste I made, I could not avoid it: for the
sea came^after me like a high mountain, or furious enemy;
so that my business was to hold my breath, and by Raising
myself on the water, preserve it by swimming. The next
dreadful wave buried me at once twenty or thirty feet detp,
but at the same time carried me with a mighty f6rce and
swi ft e'eis toward the ihore; when raising myself, [ held out
as well as< poffible, till at-length the water having spent it-r
self, began to re<urn, at which I struck forward, and feei^
*n| ground with my feet, I took to my heels again. Thus
being served twice more,, I was ut length datSei again$ a
piece of a rock, in such a manner as left me lenfelefs; bat
recovering a little before the return of the Wave, which, n6
-doubt, would then have overwhelmed me, I held fad by
the rock till these succeeding wave$ abated; and then fetch>
3
ing another ran, was overtaken by a small wave, which was
soon conquered. But before any more could overtake me,
I reached the main land, where clambering up the clifts
of the shore, tired and almost, speni I sat down on the grass,
free from the dangers of the foaming ocean.
No tongue can express the ecstasies and transports that
my foul felt at the happy deliverance It was like a re-
prieve to a dying malefactor, with a halter about his neck,
and ready to be turned off. I was. wrapt up in contempla-
tion, and often lifted up my hands, with the profoundest hu-
mility, to .the Divine Powers, for {aving my life, when the
rest of my companions were all drowned. And, now I be-
gan to cast my eyes around, to behold what place I. was in,
and what 1 had next to do. I could fee no house nor peo-
ple; I was wet, yet had ,no clothes,to shift me; hungry
and thirsty, yet had. nothing to,eat or drink; ro weapon
to destroy .any creature for my. sustenance, nor defend my-
self against devouring beasts; in short, I had nothing but a
knife, a tobacco-pipe, and a box half filled with tobacco,
The darksome night coming on upon me,* increased my
fears of being devoured by wild creatures; my mind was
plunged in despair, and having no prospect, as I thought,
of life before me, 1 prepared, for another kh?4 of death
than what I had lately escaped. I walked.about a furlong
to see, if J could find any freshwater,, which I. did, to my
great joy: and taking a quid of tobacco to prevent hun-
ger, I got up into a thick bushy tree, and, seating myself so
that I could not fall, a deep sleep overtook me, and for
that night buried my sorrows,in a^quiet r&pase.
It was broad day the next morning before I awaked;
when I not only perceived the tempest was ceased, but saw
the ship driven almost as far as the rock before-mentioned,
which the waves had dashed me against, and which was
about a mile from the place where I was. .When I came
down from rny apartment, in the tree, I perceived the
strip's boat two miles:-distant on my right-hand, lying on
shore, as the waves had cast her. I thought: to have got
f0 her; but there being an inlet of water of about half a
mile's breadth ^between it and .me, I returned again to-
wards the map, as hoping to find something for my more
immediate subsistence. About,noon, whea the sea was
calm, that I could come within a quarter of a mile of her,
it was to my grief I perceived, that, if we had kept on
board al! our lives had been'saved. These thoughts, and
22 LIVE and adventures
my solitude drew tears from my eyes, though all in Vain,
So resolving to get to the ship, I stripped and leapt into
the water, when swimming round her, I was afraid I should
not get any thing to lay hold of; but it was'my good for-
tune to espy a small piece of rope hang down by the fore*
chains, so low that, by the help of it, though with great
difficulty, I got into the forecastle of the ship. Here I
found that the ship was bulged, and had a great deal of wa-
ter in her hold; her stern was lifted up against a bank, and
her head almost to the water. All her quarter and what
was there, was free and dry. The provisions I found in
good order, with which I crammed my pockets, and losing
no time, ate while I was doing other things; 1 also found
some rum/ of which 1 took a hearty dram -, and now X
wanted for nothing except a boat, which indeed was all, to
carry away what was needful for me.
Necessity occasions quickness of thought. We had se-
veral spare yards, a spare topmast or two, and two or
three large spars of wood. With these I fell to work, and
slung as many of them overboard as I could manage, ty-
ing every one of them with a rope, that they might not
drive away. This done, I went down to the ship's side, and
tied four of them fast together at both ends, in form of a
raft, and laying two or three short pieces of plank upon
them crosswise, I found it would bear me, but not any
considerable weight. Upon which I went to work again,
cutting a spare topmast into three lengths, adding them to
my raft with a great deal of labour and pains, I then,
considered what 1 should load k with, it being notable to
bear a ponderous burden. And this I, soon thought of,
sirst laying upon it all the planks and boards I could get>
next I lowered down three of the seamen's chests, after I
had filled them with bread, rice, three Dutch cheeses, five
pieces of dried goat's stefh, and some European corn, what
little the rats had spared ^ and for liquors, I found several
cases of bottles belonging to ear skipper,' iji which were
some cordial waters, and four or five gallons of rack*
which I stowed by themselves* Bf this.time the. tide be-
ginning to flow, I perceived my coat, waistcoat, and stiirt>
swim away, which I had left on the shore; asTc-rniy linenT
breeches and stockings, 1 swam with them to the (hip;
but 1 soon sound clothed enough, though I took no more
than I wanted for the present. My eyes were chiefly on
tools to work with ; and j after a long search, I Tound out
4
the carpenter's chest, which I got safe down on my raft.
] the-a looked for arms and ammunition, and in the great
cabin found two .good fowling pieces, two pistols, several
powder horns filled, a small bag of shot, andtwo old rusty
swords. I likewise sound three barrels of powder, two of
which were good, but the third had taken water, also two
or three broken oars,-two saws, an ax, and a hammer. 1
then put to sea, and in getting to shore had three encourage-
ments, i. A smooth calm sea. /2. The tide riling and
setting in to mote. 3. The little wind there was blew to-'
wards the land. -After 1 had sailed about a mile, I found
the raft to .drive a little distance..from the place where I
first landed 5 and then 1 perceived a little opening of the
land, with a strongxurrent of the tide running into it: up-
on which I kept the middle of the stream. Eut great was
my concern, when on a sudden the forepart of my raft ran
aground, so that had I not, with great difficulty, for near
half an hour, .kept my back graining against the chests to
keep my effects in their places, all 1 had would have gone
into the sea. .But after some time, the rising of the water
caused the raft to stoat again, and coming up a little river
with land on both sides, I landed in a little cave, as near
the mouth as.postible, the better to. discover a fail, if any
such providentially pasted that way.
Not far off, I espied a hill of stupendous height, fur-
rounded with lesser hills about it, and thither 1 was re-
solved to go and view the cpunjt-ry, that I migJn see what
par.t was best 40 fix my habitation.. Accordingly, arming
myself with a pistol, a,fowling-piece, powder and ball, 1
ascended the mountain. There 1 perceived I was in an
island, encompassed by the sea; no distant lands to be seen
but scattering rocks,that lay to the west: that it seemed to
be a.ban-eo place, and, as 1 thought, inhabited only by
wild beasts. I perceived, abundance of fowls, but igno*
rant of what kind, or,-whether .good for nouri&nunt; I
ihot one of them atmy jeturo, wjiich occasioned a ceufiised
icrearmng among:the other birds, and 1 found it, by ks
colours and beak, to be a kind of a hawk, but its stem, was
perfect carrion.
When 1 came to my raft, J brought my efsed* on shore,
which work spent that day entirely^ and fearing that some
cruel beasts might devour me in the: night-time while I
auI X?4de a kind ot? hut 0l: oarricade with the chests
*a<i boar4s I )*d brought on shore. That night I slept
very comfortably; and the next morning my thoughts
were employed to make a further attempt on the ship, and
bring away what necessaries J could find, before another
ilotm fnould break her to pieces. Accordingly I got on
board as before, and prepared a second raft far more nice
than the first, upon which I brought away the carpenter's
stores, two or three bags full of nails, a great jack-screw,
a dozen or two of hatchets, and a grind stone. I also
took away several things that belonged to the gunner,
particularly two or three iron crows, two barrels of musket-
bullets, another fowling»piece, a small quantity of powder,
and a large bagful of small shot. Besides these, I took all
the men's clothes I could find, a spare fore top-fail, a ham-
mock, and some bedding; and thus completing my second
cargo, I made all the haste to shore I could, fearing some
wild beast might destroy what I had there already. But
I only found a little wild cat sitting on one of the chests,
which seeming not to fear me or the gun that I presented
at her, I threw her a piece of biscuit, which she instantly
ate, and departed.
When [ had gotten these effects on snore, I-went to work
in order to make me a little tent with the sail and some poles
which J had cut for that purpose; and having finislied it,
what things might be damaged by the weatjier I brought
En,, piling all the empty chests and ca&s in a circk, the
better to fortify it against any Judden attempt of man or
beast. After this, 1 blocked rup the fdoors with some
jaoards, and an empty chest, turned the long way out. I
then charged my gun and pistol, and laying my bed on the
f round, slept as. comfortably, till next morning, as though
had been in a Christian country.
Now, though I-had enough to subsist me a long time,
yet despairing of a sudden deliverance, or that both am-
munit on and provision might be; spent-before such thing
happened, I coveted: as much as i could; and so long as
the ship remainedtin that condition, I daily brought aVay
one necessary or other; particularly the rigging, fails, and
cordage, some twine, a barrel of wet powdery some sugar,
a barrel of ineal, three casles of rum, and, what indeed
was most welcome to me, a whole hogshead of bread.
The next time I went I cut the cables in pieces, carried
off a hawser whole, with a great deal of iron-work, and
made another raft with the mizen and sprit-faikyard; but
this being so uuwældyyby the too £eavy burdsn I had ujfcm
It, and not being able so dextrously to guide it, as the
former, both my cargo and I were overturned. For my
part, all the damage 1 sustained was a wet skin; and, atlotf
water, after much labour in diving, I got most of the ca-
bles, and some pieces of iron*
Thirteen days I had now been in the island, and eleven
times on board, bringing away all that was possible; and,
I believe, had the weather been calm, I should have
brought away the whole ship, piece by piece. As I was
going the twelfth time, the wind began to rife; however>
1 ventured at low water, and rummaging the cabin, in a
locker I found several razors, scissors, and some dozens of
knives and forks; and in another thirty-fix pounds irt
pieces of eight, silver and gold. "Ah I simple vanity,"
said I, " whom this world so much dotes on, where is now
u thy virtue, thy excellency to me? You cannot procure
"me one thing needful, nor remove me from this desolate
*' iiland to a place of plenty. One of these knives, so
"meanly esteemed, is to me more preferable than all this
<f heap. E'en therefore remain where thou art, to sink in
*f the deep as unregarded, even as a creature whose life is
u not worth preserving.'* Yet, after all this exclamation, I
wrapt it up in a piece of canvas, and began to think cf
making another raft; but I soon perceived the wind began
to arise, a fresh gale blowing from the shore, and the sky
overcast with clouds and darkness; so, thinking a raft to be
in vain, 1 let myself into the water with what things I had
about me, and it was with much difficulty I got ashore,
when soon aster it blew a fearful storm.
That night I stept very contentedly in my little tent, sur-
rounded with all my effects; but when I looked out in the
morning, no more ship was to be seen. This much sur-
prised me for the present; yet, when I considered I had lost
no time* abated no pains, and had got every thing useful
out of her, I comforted myself in the best manner, and
entirely submitted to the will of Providence.
My next thoughts were, how I should defend and secure
myself from savages and wild beasts, if any such were in
the island. At one time I thought of digging a cave, at
another f was for erecting a tent; and, at length, I re-
solved to do both: The manner or form of which will not,
I hope, be unpleasing to describe.
When I considered the ground where I was, that it was
mooriih, and had no freih water near it, my resolutions
B
were to search for a foil healthy and well watered, whereat
might not only be slieltered from the fun's scorching heat,
but be more conveniently situated,, as well to be secured
from wild men and bea#s of prey, as more easily to dis-
cover any distant sail, should it ever so happen.
And, indeed, it was not long before I had my desire,
I found a little plain near a rising hill, the front towards
which being as sleep as a house side* nothing could descend
on me from the top. On the side of this rock was a little
hollow place, resembling the entrance or door of a cave.
Just before this place, on the circle of the green, I re-
solved my te-nt mould stand. This plain did not much ex-
ceed a hundred yards broads and about twice as long* like
a delightful green before my door, with a pleasing, though
an irregular descent every way to the low grounds by the
sea-side, lying on the N. W. side of the hill, so that it was
iheltered from the excessive heat of the fun. After this, I
drew a semi-circle, containing ten yards in a femi^diame-
ter, and twenty yards in the whole, driving down two
tows of strong stakes, not six inches from each other.
Then with the pieces of cable which I had cut on board,
I regularly laid them in a circle between the piles up
to their tops, which were more than five feet out of the
earth, and after drove another row of piles looking within
fide against them, between two or three feet high, which
made me conclude it a little impregnable castle against
men and beasts. And for my better security I would have
n© door, but^enteted in and came out by the help of a
ladder, which I also made.
Here was my fence and fortress, into which I carried
fill my riches, ammunition and ilores. After which, work-
ing on the rock, what with dirt and stones I dug out, I not
only raised my ground two feet, but made a little cellar to
my mansion-house; and this cost me many days labour and
pains. One day in particular a ihower of rain falling,
thunder and lightning ensued, which put me in terror lest
my powder should take fire, and not only hinder my ne-
cessary'subsistence, by killing me food, but even blow up
me and my habitation. To prevent which, I fell to ma-
king boxes and bags, in order to separate it, having by me
near 150b!. weight. And thus being established as king of
the island, every day 1 went out with my gun to fee what I
could kill that was sit to eat. i soon perceived numbers of
goats, but very shy, yet having watched them narrowly^
md feeing I could'better shoot off the rocks than when in
Vrie low grounds, I happened to (hoot a she-goat suckling
a young kid; which not thinking its dam slain, stood by
her unconcerned; and when I took the dead creature np*
the young one followed me even to the inclosure. 1 i'rfted
the kid over the pales, and would willingly have kept it
alive; but finding it could not be brought to eat, i was
forced to stay it also for my subsistence.
Thus entered into as strange a scene of life as ever any'
man was in, I had most melancholy apprehensions concern-
ing my deplorable condition: 'and many times the tears
would plentifully run down my face, when I considered how
I was debarred from all communication with human kind.
Yet while these desponding cogitations would seem to make
me accuse Providence, other good thoughts would inter-
pose and reprove me after this manner: Well, supposing
you are desolate, is it not better to be so than totally pe-
rish? Why were you singled out to be saved, and the rest
destroyed? Wily should you complain, when not only your
life is preserved, but the strip driven even into your reach,
in order to take what was necessary out of her for your
subsistence? But to proceed. It was, by the account I kept,
the 30th of September, when I first landed on this island.
About twelve days after, fearing lest I should lose my
reckoning of time, nay, even forget the Sabbath days,
for want of _ pen, ink, and paper, I carved with a knife
upon a large post, in great letters-* and set it up, m the
similitude of a cross, on the sea-more where I landed, I
came on Jbore> Sept. 30, .1659. Every day I cut a notch
with my knife on the sides of this square post, and that on the
Sabbath was as long again as the rest ; and every first day of
the month as iong again as that long one. Jii this manner
1 kept my calendar, weekly, monthly, or yearly reckoning
of time. But had I made a more strict search (as afterwards
I did) I needed not have set up this mark; for among the
parcels belonging to the gunner, carpenter, and captain's
mate, I found those very things 1 wanted; particularly
pens, ink, and paper; also 1 found two or three conr-
passes, some mathematical instruments, dials, perspective
glasses, books of navigation, three Engltsti Bibles, and
several other .good books, which I carefully put up.—
Here J cannot but call to mind our having a dog and
two cats on board, whom I made inhabitants with me in.
ray castle. Though one might think I had all the neces-
iaries that were desirable, yet still I sound several things

wanting. My ink was daily wasting; I wanted need ice,
pins, and thread to mend or keep my clothes together; and
particularly a spade, pickax, or shovel, to remove the
earth. It was a year before I iinistied my little bulwark;
and having some intervals of relaxation, after my daily-

proceeded to make a chair and a table, and so began to
study such mechanical arts as seemed to me practicable.
When I wanted a plank or board, I hewed down a tree
with my hatchet, making it as thin with my ax as possible,
and then smooth enough with an adz to answer my designs -.
yet though I'could make no more this way than one board
out of a tree, in length of time I got boards enough to
shelter ail my stores, every thing being regularly placed,
and my guns securely hanging against the side of the rock.
This made it a very pleasant sight to me, as being the re-

fixing and settling of my habitation, as heretofore shown.
JOURNA L,
September 30th, 1659, I, unhappy RobinYon Crusoe*
having suffered shipwreck, was driven on this desolate
Island, which I named the Desolate Island of Despair, my
companions being swallowed up in the tempestuous ocean.
The next day I spent in consideration of my unhappy cir-
cumstances, having no prospect but of death, either to be
starved wkh hunger, or devoured with beasts or merciless
savages.
Oct. 1. That morning, with great comfort, I beheld
the ship drove ashore. Some hopes 1 had, that when the
storm was abated, I might be able to get some food and
necessaries out ofher, which I conceived were not damaged,
because the (hip did stand upright. At this time I la-
mented the loss of my companions, and our misfortune in
leaving the vessel. When I perceived the ship as it were
lie dry, I waded through the sands, then swam aboard, the
weather being very rainy, and with scarcely any wind.
To the 14th of this month, my time was employed in
making voyages, every tide getting what I could out of the
ship. The weather very wet and uncertain.
Oct. 20. My raft and all the goods thereon were overset;
yet I recovered most again at low water.
Oct. 25. It blew hard, and rained night and day, whm;
the {hip went in^pieces, so that nothing was seen of her
but the wreck at low water. This day 1 secured my goodi^
from the inclemency of the weather.
B3
Oct. 26. I wandered to fee where I could find a plae&
convenient for my abode. I fixed upon a rock in the evea-
ing, marked out a half-moon, intending to erect a wall,
fortified with piles, lined within with pieces of cables, and
covered with turf.
Nov. 1. I erected my tent under a rock, and took up
my lodgings very contentedly in a hammock that night.
Nov. 2. This day I fenced myself in with timber, chests,
and boards.
Nov. 3. I shot two wild fowl, resembling ducks, which
were good to eat, and in the afternoon made me a table.
Nov. 4, I began to live regularly. In the morning I
allowed myself two or three hours to walk out with my
gun; 1 then worked till near eleven o'clock, and after-
wards refreshed myself with what I had to eat. From
twelve to two I would lie down to sleep. Extremely sul-
try weather. In the evening go to work again.
Nov. 5. Went out with my gun and dog, shot a wild
cat with a soft skin, but her flesh was good for nothing.
The skins of those I killed, I preserved. In my return,
J perceived many wild birds, and was terrified by some
seals which made ofr to sea.
. Nov. 6. Completed my table.
Nov. 7. Fair weather. I worked till the 12th, but
omitted the 1 nh, which, according to my calculation/ I
supposed to be Sunday.
Nov. \y. Rain in abundance, which, however, much
cooled the air; with thunder and lightening, caused in
me a terrible surprise. The weather clearing, I secured
my powder in separate parcels.
Nov, 14.—16. I made little boxes for my powder,
lodging them in .several places. I also shot a large fowl,
which proved excellent meat.
Nov. 17. 1 began to dig in the rock, yet was obliged
;to delist for want of* a pickax, shovel, and wheelbarrow.
Iron crows I caused to supply the place of the sirlt 5 but
with all my art I could not make a wheelbarrow.
Nov. iSL it was my fortune to find a tree, resembling
what.Brazilians call an iron tree. I had like to have fpoil-
cj my ax with cutting it, being very hard and exceedingly
heavy* yet with much labour and industry, 1 made a fort
,of a spa^e put of it.
Nov. 23. These tools being made, I daily carried on my
business 3 eighteen days I allowed for enlarging my cave*
that it-might serve me, not only for a warehouse, but kit-
chen, parlour, ^id cellar. I commonly lay in the tent, un-
less the weather was rainy that 1 could not lie dry. Sq
wet would it be at certain seasons, that i was obliged to
cover ail within the pale with long poles,, in the form of
rasters, leaning against the rock, and loaded them with
flags and large leaves of trees', resembling a thatch.
Dec. 10. No sooner did I think"my habitation finished,
but suddenly a great deal of the top broke in, so that i.t
was a mercy i was not buried in the ruins. This occa-
sioned^ great deal of pains and trouble to me, before t
could make it firm and durable.
Dec. 17. I nailed up some shelves and drove nails and
staples in the wall and posts to hang things out of the way.
Dec. 20. Every thing I got into its place, then made a
fort of a dresser, and another table.
Dec. 24, 25. Rain in abundance.
Dec. 26. Very fair weather.
Dec. 27. 1 chanced to light on some goats, shot one;
and wounded another. I led it home in a string, bound
up its leg, and cured it in a little time; at length it became
so tame and familiar as to feed before the door, and follow-
me where I pleased. This put me in mind to bring up
tame creatures, in order to supply me with food after my
ammunition was- spent.
Dec. 28,. 29, 30. The weather being excessively hot,
with little air, obliged me for the most part, to keep within
doors.
Jan. 1. Still sultry, however," obliged by neceility, I
went out with my gun, and found a great store of goats irt
the vallefs; they were exceedingly shy, nor could my dog
hunt them down.
Jc:n. 3 to 14. My employment this time Was to Hriiflx
the wall before described, and search the Island. 1 dis-
covered a kind of pigeons like our house-pigeons in a nesE
among the rocks. 1 brought them home, nursed them till
they could fly, and then they left me. After this, i shot
some, which proved excellent food. Some time I spent
vainly in contriving to make a cask; I may well say it was
vain, because 1 could neither joint the staves, nor fix the
heads, so as to make it tight: So^ leaving that, took some
goat's tallow I had about me, and a little crkimV for the
wick, and provided myself with a lamp, which served ir.£-
instead of candles.

But now a very strange event happened. For being m
•the height of my search, what should corns.into my hand,
Jbut a bag, which was used to hold corn (as I supposed) for
the fowls; so immediately resolving to put gunpowder in it,
I shook all the husks and dirt upon one fide of the rock,
little expecting what the consequence would be. The rain
had fallen plentifully a few days before; and about a month
after, to my great amazement, something began to look
out very green and flourishing; and when 1 came to view it
more nicely, every day as it grew, I found about ten or
twelve ears of green barley appeared in the very fame
shape and make as that in England.
I can scarce express the agitations of my mind at this
fight. Hitherto I had looked upon the a^ions of this life
no otherwise thzn on'y as the events of blind chance and
fortune. But now, the appearance of this barley, flourish-
ing in a barren foil, and my ignorance in not conceiving how
it should come there, made me conclude, that miracles were
not yet ceased': nay, I even thought that God had appoint-
ed it to grow there without any seed, purely for my suste-
nance in this miserable and desolate island. And indeed
such great effect this had upon me, that it often made n e
melt into tears, through a grateful fense of God's mercies;
and the greater still was my thankfulness, when I per-
ceived about this little field of barley some rice stalks, also
wonderfully flourishing.
While thus pleased in mind, I concluded there must be
more corn in the island; and therefore made a diligent
search narrowly among the rocks; but not being able to
find any, on a sudden it came into mind, how T had shaken
the husks of corn-out of the bag, and then my admiration
ceased, with my gratitude to the Divine Being, as thinking
it njoas hut natural, and not to be conceived a miracle;
thoi gh even the manner of its preservation might have
made me own it as a wonderful event of God's kind pro-
vidence.
It was about the latter end of June when the ears of this
corn ripened, which I laid up very carefully together with
20 cr 30 stalks of rice, expecting one day 1 should reap
the fruit of my labour; yet four years were expired be-
fore I ,could allow myself to eat any barley bread, and
much longer time before I had any rice. After this, with
indefatigable pains and industry, for three or four months,
at last I fiated niy wall on the 14th of April,, having no
way to 50 into it, but by a ladder against the wall.
April 16- I finished my ladder, and ascended it; after-
wards pulled it up, then let it down on the otaer Mae,
and descended into my new habitation, where I had {pace
enough, and so fortified that nothing could attack me,
without scaling the walls. # .
But what does all human pains and industry avail, if the
blessing; of God does not crown our labours? Or who can
stand before the Almighty, when he stretcheth forth his
arm * For one time as I was at the entrance of myxave,
there happened such a dreadful earthquake, that not omy
the roof of the cave came rumbling about my ears, but
the posts seemed to crack terribly at the same time. This
put me in great amazeinement; and running to the ladder,
and acting over the wall, I then plainly knew it was an
earthquake, the place I stood on sustaining three ternbic
shocks in less than three minutes. But judge cf my ter-
ror when I saw the top of a great rock roll into the seas I
then expected the island would be swallowed up every mo-
ment: And what made the scene Pfil more dreadiui, was
to fee the sea thrown into the most violent agitations and
disorders by this tremendous aqcident.
For my part I stood like a criminal at the place of exe-
cution ready to expire. At the moving of .the earths I
was, as it were, sea-sick; and>very miici, afrajd lest ,tbe
rock, under which was my fence and habitation, :sttpu|d
overwhelm it and myfejf in a lasting tomb., , .a,.;
When the third dreadful.(hook had spent :itfe¥,-my spi-
rits: began to revive; yet still I would 1105 venture tp.asccnd
the ladder,;but continued sitting, not knowing wl^tj;should
do. So little grace had I then, as only toJay, Lm^tw?
mercy npm me! and no sooner was the earthquake Qver, but
tlxat pathetic prayer left me.. . , :_\-, . .;,;
It was not long after, when,aJiorriMe.^rop^stArofe at
- the fame time attended with, a Jwnsiwe^fi wjpj..:/srhe-
sea seemed mountains high, and ttewft^s foiled fo-iw-
petuously, that aothbg .cowld'b* pef ceiv^tutftpt^and

lent a manner, as to tear the very trees up by she roots,
which was succeeded by abundance of jtftin,, >yhen the
tempest was over I went: to my* tent: *bu|» tfce f ain coming
on in a furious manner, I was obliged tp/tafce iheker in the
cave, where I was forced to cut a.chaww:l,lta»Pgferoyifo»-

tifkation to let the water out. It continued raining all that
night, and some time the next day. These accidents made
me resolve, as soon as the weather cleared up, to build me
a little hut in some open place, walled round to defend me
from wild creatures and savages; not doubting but at the
next earthquake, the mountain would fall upon my habi-
tation and me, and swallow up all in its bowels.
April \6—20. These days I spent in contriving how
and in what manner I should fix my place of abode. All
this while I was under the most dreadful apprehensions.
When I looked round my habitation, every thing I found in
its proper place. I had several resolutions whether I should
move or not; but at length resolved to stay where I was, till
I found out a convenient place where I might pitch my tent.
April 22. When I began to put my resolutions in prac-
tice, I was stopt for want of tools and instruments to work
with. Most of my axes and hatchets were useless, occa-
sioned by cutting the hard timber that grew on the island.
It took me up a full week to make my grind stone of use to
me, and at last I found out a way to turn it about with
my foot, by help of *i wheel and a string.
April 28,29. These days were spentin grinding my tools.
April 30. My bread falling sliort, Tallowed myself but
one biscuit a day.
May 1. As I walked along the sea (bore, I found a bar-
rel of gunpowder, and several pieces of the wreck, the sea
had flung up. Having secured those, I made to the ship,
whose stern was torn off, and washed a great distance
ashore; but the rest lay in the sands. This I suppose was
©ccafioned by the earthquake. I now resolved to keep
my old place of abode; and also to go to the (hip that
$Jay> but then found it impossible.
May 3. This day I went on board, and with my saw
&wed off one of the beams, which kept her quarter-deck.
I then cleared the sand till flood.
May 4. I caught some frfh, but they were not whole-
some. The same day I also catched a young dolphin.
May 5. This day I also repaired to the wreck, and
sawed another piece of timber, and when the flood came,
I made a stoat of three great planks, which were driven
ashore by the tide.
May 6, 7, 8, 9. These days I brought off the'iron bolts
Opened the deck with the iron crow, and carried two planks
to land, haying made a v/ay into the yery middle of the
wreck,
May 10, II, 12, 13, 14. All this time I spent in bring-
ing- ofBgreat quantities of iron and timber.
May 15. Took with me two hatchets on purpose to cut
off some lead from the roll, bat all in" vain, for it lay too
low under water.
M*y 16. I omitted going to the wreck this day, for em-
ploying myself in looking for pigeons, I outstaid my time;
May 17. I perceived several pieces of the wreck driven
ashore, whicrrl found belonged to the head of the (hip. ^
May 24 To this*day 1 worked on the wreck, and with
great difficulty loosened some things so much with the crow,
that at the first flowing tide several casks floated out, and
many of the seamen's chests, yet that "day nothing came to
land but pieces of timber, and a hogshead which had som.2
Brazil pork in it J continued working to the 15th of
June; (except necessary times for food and rest) and had
I known-how to have built a boat, 1 had timber and planks
enough: 1 had also near 100 weight of sheet lead.
June 16. As-I was wandering towards the sea-stde, I
found a large tortoise or turtle, being the first I had seen
on the-island' though-, as I afterwards found, there were
many on ifye other fide of it.
June -17/ This d-ayT spent in cooking it, found in her
threescore * ggs, and her flesh the molt savoury and plea-
sant I ever tasted in my life.
June 18. I staid within this day, there being a continual
rain; and it was somewhat more chilly and cold tnan usual.*
June 19;, Exceedingly bad,being taken with a trembling
and thivering.
June 20. Awake ail night, my head racked with pair*
and feverish.
June 21. Sick unto death, and terrified with the dismal
apprehensions of my condition. Prayed to God more fre-
quently, but very confusedly.
June 22. Something better, but still uneasy in 'my mind»
June 23. Again relapsed much as before.
June -24. Mended a second time.
June 25. A violent ague for seven hours, cold an4!h6t
fits succeeded with faint sweats.
June 26. Better, but very weak, yet I.scrambled out,*
shot a she-goat, brought it home and broiled some of it;
I would willingly have stewed it, and made some broth,
but had no pot.

June 27. All this day I was asllicled with an ague;
thirsty, yet could not help my self to water: Prayed to God.
in these words: <x Lord, in pity lock upon me: Lord
*' have mercy upon me: have mercy upon me!" After
this I fell asleep, which I fouud had much refreihed me
when I awaked. I fell fast asleep a second time, and fell
into this strange and terrible fort of dream.
Methought I was fitting on the fame fpot^of ground at
the outside of the wall where J fat when the storm blew,
after the earthquake; and that I saw a man descending
from a great black cloud, and alight upon the ground. He
was all over as bright as a stash of lire that a little before
surrounded him; his countenance inconceivably terrible;
the earth as it were trembled when he slept upon the
ground, and flames of fire seemed to sill all the air. No
sooner I thought him landed upon the earth, but with a
long spear, or other weapon, he made towards me; but
iirst ascending a rising ground, his voice added to my
amazement, when I thought I heard him pronounce these
dreadful words, " Unhappy wretch! feeing all these things
u have not brought thee to repentance, thou shalt imme-
€C diately die." Jn pronouncing this dreadful sentence, I
thought he went to kill me with the spear that was in his
hand.
Any body may think it impostible for me to express the
horrors of my mind at this vision: and even when I awak-
ed, this very dream made a deep impression upon my
mind. The little divine knowledge I had, I received
from my father's instructions, and.that was worn out by an
uninterrupted series of sea-faring impiety for eight years
space. Except what sickness forced from me, I do not
Temember I had one thought of lifting up my heart to-
wards God, but rather had a certain stupidity of foul, not
having the least fense or fear of the Omnipotent Being
when in distress, nor of gratitude to him for his deliver-
ances. Nay, when I was on the desperate expedition on
the desert African shore, I cannot remember I had one
thought of what would become of me, or to beg his con-
solation and assistance in my sufferings and distress. When
the Portugal captain took me up, and honourably used me,
nay, farther, when I was even delivered from drowning by
escaping to this island, I never looked upon it as a judg-
ment, but only said I was an unfortunate dog, and that's
all. Indeed, some secret transports os sgui 1 had, whick
was not through grace, but only a common flight of joy,
that I was yet alive, when my companions were all drown-
ed, and no other joy could I conceive but what is common
with the sailors over a bowl of punch, after they hays
escaped the greatest dangers.
The likelihood of wanting for neither food nor conve-
niences, might have called upon me for a thankful ac-
knowledgment to Providence. Indeed, the growth of my
corn touched me with some fense; but that soon wore off
again. The terrible earthquake pointed to me, as it were,
the finger of God, but my dreadful amazement continued
no longer than its duration. But now, when my spirits be-
gan to fink under the burden of a strong distemper, and
1 could leisurely view the miseries of death present them-
selves before my eyes, then my awakened conscience be-
gan to reproach me with my past life, in which I had so
wickedly provoked the justice of God to pour down his
vengeance upon me.
Such reflections as these oppressed me even in the vio-
lence of distemper. Some prayers I uttered, which only
proceeded from the fear of death. But when I considered
my father's advice and prophecy, I could not forbear
weeping; for he told me, "That if I did persist in my
"folly, I mould not only be deprived of God's blessing,
*' but have time enough to reflect upon my despising his
c< instructions, and this, in a wretched time, when none
"could help me. And now concluding it to be fulfilled,
having no foul in the ifiand to administer any comfort to
me, I prayed earnestly to the Lord, that he would help me
in this my great calamity. And this, I think, was the first
time I prayed in sincerity for many years. But now I
must return to my journal.
June 28. Something refreshed with sleep, and the sit
quite off, I got up. My dream still occasioned in me a
great consternation; and, fearing that the ague might re-
turn the succeeding day, I concluded it time to get some-
thing to comfort me. I silled a case bottle with water,
and set it within reach of my bed; and, to make it more
nourishing and less chilly, I put some rum in it. The ne.x£
thing 1 did was to broil me a piece of goat's flesh, of which
1 ate but little. I was very weak ; however, walked about,
dreading the return of my distemper; and at night I sup-
ped on three of the turtle's eggs, which I roasted and ate^
Begging God's bleiling therewith.
After I had eaten, I attempted to walk, again oui 0s
doors with my gun; but was so weak, that 1 sat down, and
looked at the sea, which was smooth and calm. While I
continued here, these thoughts came into my mind.
In what manner is the production of the earth and sea,.of
which i have seen so much? From whence came myself,
and all other creatures living, and of what are they made?
Our beings were assuredly created by some almighty
invisible Power, wrho framed the earth, the sea, and air,
and all therein. But what is that Power?
Certainly it must follow that God has created it all.
Yet, said 1, is God has made aii this he must be the Ruler
of them all, and what is relating thereto; for certainly the
Power that makes, must indisputably have a power to guide
and direct them. And if this be so, (as certainly it must)
nothing can happen without his knowledge and appoint-
ment. Then, lurely, if nothing happens without God's
appointmnnt, certainly God has appointed these my suf-
ferings to befal me. And here I fixed my firm belief that
it was his will that it should be so; and then proceeded to
inquire, why mould God deal with me in this manner?
Or what have I done thus to deserve his indignation?
Here conscience flew in my face, reprehending me as a
blasphemer; crying with a loud and piercing voice, «' Un-
ff worthy wretch! how dare you ask what you have done?
"Look on your past life, and see what you have left undone?
"A£k thyself, why thou wert not long ago in the merciless
"hands of death? Why not drowned in Yarmouth roads,
"or killed in the fight, when the ship was taken by the
tc Sallee man of war? Why not entombed in the bowels of
"wild beasts on the African- coast, or drowned here when .
"all thy companions suffered shipwreck in the ocean?"
Struck dumb with these reflections, 1 rose up in a pen-
sive manner, being so thoughtful that I could not go to
steep; and fearing the dreadful return of my distemper, it
caused me to remember, that the Brazilians use tobacco
for almost all diseases. I then went to my chest in order
to find some, where Heaven, no doubt, directed me to find
a cure for both soul and body; for there I found one of
the Bibles, which, till this time, 1 had neither leisure nor
inclination to look into. I took both the tobacco and that
out of the chest, and laid them on the table. Several ex±
periments did I try with the tobacco; First, I took a piec€
of leaf,, and chewed it $ but it being very green and strongs
almost stupefied me. Next I steeped it in seme rum an
hour or two, resolving when I went to bed to take a dose
of it: and, in the third place, I burnt some over a pan of
fire, holding my nose over it as long as I could endure it
without suffocation.
In the intervals of this operation, though my head was
giddy and disturbed by the tobacco, I took up the Bible
to read. No sooner did I open it, but there appeared to
me these words, u Call on me in the day of trouble, and £
6{ will deliver thee, and thou malt glorify me."
At first this sentence made a very deep impresiioia on my
heart, but it soon wore off again, when I considered the
word deliver was foreign to me. And as the children of
Israel said, when they were promised flesh to eat, "Can
God spread a table in the wilderness?" in like manner I
began to fay, "Can God himself deliver me from this deso-
late island r" However, the words would still return to my
mind, and afterwards made a greater impression upon me.
As it was now very late, and the tobacco had dozed my
head, I was inclined to sleep; but before I would lie down
I fell on my knees, and implored the promise that God had
made to me in the Holy Scriptures, that " if I called upon
him in the day of trouble he would deliver me." With
much difficulty I afterwards drank the rum, wherein 1 had
steeped the tobacco, which flying into my head, threw me
into such a profound sleep, that it was three o'clock the
next day before I awaked; or rather, I believe, I slept two
days, having certainly lost a day in my account, and I
could never tell any other way. When J got up, my spi-
rits were lively and cheerful; my stomach much better,
being very hungry; and, in short, no fit returned the next
day, which was the 29th, but I found my self much altered:
for the better.
The 30th, I went abroad with my gun, but not far, and
killed a sea-fowl or two, resembling a brand goose, which*
however, I cared not to eat when 1 brought them home,
but dined on two more of the turtle's eggs In the even-
ing I renewed my medicine, excepting that I did not take
so large a quantity, neither did 1 chew the leaf, or hold
my head over the smoke: but the next day, which was the
1st of July, having a little return of the cold fit, I again
took my medicine as I did the first time.
July 3. The fit quite left me, but very weak. In this
condition, I often thought of these words, " I will deliver
thee s" and while, at some times, I would think of the
impossibility os it, other thoughts would reprehend ine for
disregarding the deliverances I had received-, even, from
the most forlorn and distressed condition. I a iked myself,
what regard have I had to God for his abundant mercies?
Have I done my part? u He has delivered me, but 1 have
"not glorified him :"—as if i had said, 1 bad not owned
and been thankful for these as deliverances, and how could
I expect greater? So much did this sensibly touch my
heart, that I gave God thanks for my recovery from sick-
ness in the molt humble prostration.
July 4. This morning I began seriously to ponder on
what is written in the New Testament, resolving to read a
chapter every morning and night as long as my thoughts
would engage me. As soon as I set about this work seri-
ously, I found my heart deeply affected with the impiety
of my past life; these words that I thought were spoken
to me in my dream revived, " All these things have not
ic brought thee to repentance." After this, I begged of
God to assist me with his Holy Spirit in returning to my
duty. One day, in perusing the Scriptures, I came to these
words, " He is exalted a Prince and a Saviour, to give
"repentance and to give remission:" Immediately i laid
down the book, and with uplifted hands to Heaven, loudly
cried, "O blessed Jesus, thou son of David, Jesus, thou
"exalted Prince and Saviour, give me repentance!" And
now indeed I prayed with a true sense of my condition,
and a more certain hope, founded ,on the word of God.
Now I had a different sense of these words, " Call on me
tf and I will deliver thee," that is from the dreadful load
of guilt which oppressed my sinful foul, and not from a so-
litary life, which might rather be called a blessing, feeing
I wanted neither food nor raiment, when compared with
living among the human race, surrounded with so much
oppression, misery, and affliction: In a word, I came to
this conclusion, that a deliverance from fin was a much
greater blessing,, than a deliverance from affliction. But
again I proceed to my journal.
To the 14th of July, I walked about with my gun,
little and little at a time, having been reduced to the
greatest extremity of weakness. The applications and
experiments I ;ufed were perfectly new: neither could I
recommend them to any one's practice. For though it
carried off the sit, it very much weakened me, and 1 had
frequently convulsions ia my nerves aud limbs for some
time. From this 1 learned, that going.abroad in rainy
weather, especially when it was attended with storms and
hurricanes of wind, was most pernicious to health. I had
now been about ten months in the lila^d; and as I never
had ieen any of the human kind, i therefore accounted
myself as sole monarch; and as i grew better, having se-
cured my habitation to my mind, i resolved to make a
tour round my kingdom, in order to make new discoveries.
The 15 th of July, I began my journey; * first went to
the creek, where i had brougnt my rafts on shore; and
travelling farther, found the tide went no higher than two
miles up, where there was a little brook of running water,
on the bank of which were many pleasant savannahs or
meadows, plain, smooth, and covered with grass. On
the riling parts, where i supposed the water did not reach,
I perceived a great deal of tobacco growing to a very
strong stalk. Several other plants I likewise sound, the
virtues of which i did not understand. I searched a long
time for the Cassava root, which I knew the Indians in
that climate made their bread ofVbut all in vain. There
were several plants of aloes, though at that time 1 knew
not what they were; likewise I saw several sugar canes,
but imperfect for want of cultivation. With these few
discoveries, i came back tl.at night, and slept contentedly
in my little castle.
Trie next day, being the 16th, going the fame way,
but farther than the day before, I found the country more
adorned with woods and trees. Kere I perceived different
fruits in great abundance. Melons in plenty lay on the
ground, and clusters of grapes, rir e and very rich, spread
over the trees. You may imagine I was glad of this dis-
covery, yet ate very sparingly, lest I should throw myse'f
into a flux or sever. The grapts I found of excellent use;
for when i had dried them in the sun, which preserved
them as dried raisins are kept, they proved very whole-
some and nourishing, and served me in those seasons when
no grapes wrere to be had.
The night drawing on apace, I ascended up a tree, and'
slept very comfortably, though it was the first time 1 had
lain out of my habitation. And when the morning came,
1 proceeded with great pleasure on my way, travelling
about four rniies, as 1 imagined, by the length of the val-
ley, directing my course northward, there being a ridge of
hills on the south and north side os me. At the end of this
aZ LITE AND Al?VENTtjAfS J
valley^I came to an opening, w' ere the country seemed i$
descend to the-west; there I found a Jittle spring oi fresh,
water, proceeding out os the side of the hill, with its
crystal streams running directly easti Arid,-indeed, heremy
fenses were charmed with the most beautiful landscape na-
ture could afford; for, the country appeared flourishing,
green, and delightful^ that to me it seemed like a planted
garden. I then descende I on the fide of that delicious
vale, when I found abundance of cocoa, orange, lemon,
and citron trees, but very wild and barren at that time.
As for the limes, they were delightful-ar>d wholesome, the
juice of which I aster used to mix- in water, which made it
very cooling and refreshing* Awl now I was resolved to
carry home and lay up a store of grapes, limes, and lemons*
against the approaching wet season, So la\ing them up
in separate parcels, and then taking-a few of each with
me, 1 returned to my little castle, after having spent three
days in this journey* Before i got home, the grapes were
so bruised that-they were utterly ipoiled; the limes indeed
were good, but of those i could bring only a few.
July 19. Having prepared two bags, I returned thlthef
again, but, to my great surprise, found* all the grapes
spread about, trod to pieces, and abundance eaten,which
made me conclude there were wild beasts thereabouts. To*
prevent this happening again, I gathered a large q.cf^ntity
of the grapes, and hung them upon the out branches of
the tree, both to keep them unhurt, and that they might
cure and dry in the fun: and -having well loaded myself
with limes and lemons, I returned once more to my old
place of residence.
And now contemplating on the frukfukiess-cf this valleys
and pleasantness of its situation, its security from stormy
and the delight fulness of its situation^ its security from
storms, and the delightfulness of the adjacent woods, I
concluded I was fettled in the worst part of the country*
and therefore was thinking to remove my habitation-.
But when f considered again, that though it was plea-i
fant, it was off from the sea-fides where there was a possi-
bility, some time cr other, a ship might either be driven
or sail by; and that to inclose myself among "hills and
woods must certainly put an end to my hopes of deliver-
ance; i resolved to let my castle remain whe-re Providence
had first assigned it. Yet so ravished was j wkh this places
that J made me a little kind of bower, surrounding it with
a double hedge, as high as I could reach, well staked
&nd filled with bullrufhes: and having spent a great part
of the month of July, I think it was the first of August
before I began to enjoy my labour.
Aug. 3. Perceiving my grapes to be dry, I took them
from the trees, and they proved excellent good raisins of
the fun: the most of which I carried to my cave; and
happy for me I did so; by which 1 saved the best part of
* my winter food.
Aug. 14. This day it began to rain; and though I had
made me a tent like the other, yet having no shelter of a
hill to keep me from storms, nor a cave behind me to re-
peat to, I was obliged to return to my old castle. The
rain continued more or less every day, till the middle of
October; and sometimes so violently, that 1 could not stir
out of my cave for several days. This season 1 found my
family to increase; for one of my cats that ran away from,
me, and which 1 thought had been dead, returned about
August, with three kittens at her heels, like herself, which
I thought strange, because both my cau were females, and
the wild cats of theisiand seemed to be of a different kind
from our European cats; but from these cats proceeded
such numbers, that I was sorceed to kill and aeitroy them
as I would do wild beasts and vermin.
To the 26th of this month, I could not stir out, it rain-
ing incessantly; when beginning to want food, I was com-
pelled to venture twice, the first of which I mot a goat,
and afterwards found a very large tortoise. The manner
of my regulating my food was thus: a bunch of raisins served
me for my breakfast, a piece of goat's Hem or turtle boiled
for my dinner, and two or three turtle's eggs for my supper.
While the rain lasted, J daily worked two or three hours at
enlarging my cave, and by degrees worked it on towards
one side, till I came to the outside of the hill, and made a
door or way out, which came beyond my fence or wall,
and so I came in and out this way. But after 1 had done
this, I was troubled to fee myself thus exposed; though I
could not perceive any thing to fear, a goat being the
biggest creature I had seen upon this island.
Sept. 3c. Casting up my notches on my post,, which
amounted to 365, i concluded this to be the anniversary
of my landing; and, therefore, humbly prostrating myself
on the ground, confessing my sins, acknowledging God's
righteous judgments upon me, and praying to Jesus Christ
to have mercy upon me, I fasted for twelve hours till the
going down of the fun; and then eating a biscuit and a
bunch of grapes, laid me on the bed, and with great com-
fort took my night's repose. Till this time 1 never had
distinguished the Sabbath-day; but now I made a longer
notch than ordinary for the days of rest, and divided the
weeks as well as I could, though 1 found I had lost a day
or two in my account. My ink failing soon after, I omit-
ted in my daily memorondum things of an indifferent na-
ture, and contented myself to write down only the most
remarkable events of my life. The rainy and dry seasons
appeared now regular to me, and experience taught me
how to provide for them; yet, in one thing f am going to
relate, my experience very much failed me. You may call
to mind what I have mentioned of some barley and rice
which I had saved; about thirty stalks of the former, and
twenty of the latter; and, at that time^ the fun being in
its southern position, going from me, together with the.
rains, made me conclude it a very proper season to sow it.
Accordingly I dug up a piece of ground, with my wooden
spade, and dividing it into two parts, sowed about two
thirds of ray feed, preserving by me about a handful each.
-And happy it was 1 did so; for no rains falling, it was
choaked up, and never appeared above the earth till the
wet season came again, and then part of it grew, as if k,
had been newly sown.
I was resolved iiill to make another trial; and seeking"
for a moister piece of ground near my bovver, I there sowed
the rest of my seed in February, a little before the vernal"
equinox; which having the rainy months of March and
April to water it, yielded a noble crop, and sprang up
very pleasantly. I had still saved part of the seed, not
daring to venture all; and by the time I found out the
proper seasons to sow it in, and that 1 might expect every
year two seed-times and two harvests, my stock amounted
to above half a peck of each fort of grain.
No sooner were the rains over, but the stakes which,
had cut from the trees, shot out like willows the first year
after lopping their heads. I was ignorant of the tree I cut
them from; but they grew so regularly beautiful, that they
made a most lively appearance, and so flourished in three
years time, that 1 resolved to cut more of tnem 3 and theffe
•soon growing made a glorious fence, as afterwards I shall
observe.
And now I perceived that the seasons of the year mi^ht
generally be divided, not into summer and winter, as in
Europe, but into uet and dry seasons, as in this manner;

The wet seasons would continue longer or sliorter,as the
winds happened to .blow. But having found the ilJ conse-
quences of being abroad in the rain, 1 took care before-
hand to furnish myself with provisions; and during the wet
months fat within doors as mucli as possible. At this time
I contrived to make many things that I wanted, though it
cost me much labour and pains, before I could accomplish
them. The first I tried was to make a basket; but all the
twigs I could get proved so brittle, that I could not then
perform it. It now 'proved of great advantage to me that
when a boy, I took a great delight in standing at a basket-
maker's in the fame town where my father lived, to view
them at work; and, like other boys, curious to fee the
manner of their working these things, and very officious to
assist, \ perfectly learned the method of it, and Wanted no-
thing but the tools. And it coming into my inind, that
the twigs of'that tree of which 1 made my stakes, might be
as tough as a sallow willow, or osiers, growing ik England,
I resolved to make an experiment, and went the next day
to my country-seat, and found some fit for my titrn; and
after cutting down a quantity with my hatchet, I dried them
in my pale, and, when sit to work with, carried tJbem to
my cave, where I employed myself in making severs sort*
os baskets, insomuch that I could put in whatsoever I pleased.
It is true, they were not cleverly made, yet they served my
turn upon all occasions.
But still I wanted two necessary, things. I had.no caste
to hold my liquor, except two rundlets almost full of rum,
a few bottles of an ordinary size, and some square cafe
bottles, neither had I a pot to boil any thing in, only a
large kettle unfit to make broth, or stevv a bit of meat: I
wanted likewise at the beginning of this dry season a to-
bacco pipe; but for this I afterwards found an expedient.
I kept myself employed in planting my second row of
stakes. But remembering that when I travelled up to the
brook, I had a mind to fee the whole island, I stow resumed
my intention, and taking my dog, gun, hatchet, two bis-
cuit cakes, a great bunch of raisins, wirh a larger quantity
of powder and shot than ufual> I began my journey* Hav-
ing passed the vale where my bower stood, I came within
view of the sea lying to the west; when it being a clear
day, I fairly descried land, extending from the W. to the
S. W. about ten or fifteen leagues, as I concluded; but
could not fay whether it was an island or a continent.-^
Neithercould I tell what this place might be; only thought
it was part of America, and where I might have been in
a miserable condition, had 1 landed* Again J considered
that if this was the Spanish coast, certainly, one time or
other, I should fee some ship pass by; and if it wras not,
then it iriust be the savage coast, between the Spanisti
country and Brazil, which abounds with cannibals or man-
eaters.
As I proceeded foward I found this side of the island
much more pleasant than mine; the fields fragrant adorned
with sweet flowers and verdant grafs, together with several
very fine woods. There were parrots in plenty, which
made me long for one to be my companion; but it was
with great difficulty I could knock one down with my
£*ck; and 1 kept him at home some years before I could
get him to call me by my name.
In the low grounds, i found various forts of hares and
foxes, as I took them to be* but much different from those
in England. Several of these f killed, but never ate
them; neither indeed had I any occasion; for abounding
with goits, pigeons, turtle, and grapes, I could defy
Leadeniiall market to furnish me a better table. In thi-s
journey J did not travel above two miles a-day, because I
took several turns and windings, to fee what discoveries [
could make returning weary enough to the place where I
designed to reft all night, wnich was either in a tree, or in
a place which 1 surrounded with stakes, that no wild crea-
ture might suddenly surprise me. When I came to the sea
shore, 1 was amazed to fee the splendour of it. Its strand
was covered with shells of the most beautiful ii(h, atid con-
stantly abounding with innumerable turtles, and fowls of
many kinds, which 1 was ignorant of, except those called
penguins. 1 might have shot as many as I pleased, but
was sparing os my ammunition, rather choosing to kill a
ihe-goat, which 1 did with much difficulty, on account of
• the statness of the country.
Now though this journey produced me the most pleasing
satisfaction, yet my habitation was so much to my liking,
that J did not repine at my being seated on the worst part
of the island, i continued niy journey, travelling about
twelve miles further towards die east, where I set a great
pile on the shore for a mark, concluding that my next
journey mould bring me to the other side of the island, east
from my castle, and so round till I came to my post again.
As I had a constant view of the^ country, I thought I
could not miss my way; but scarce hud I travelled three
miles, when I descended into a very large-valley, so sur-
rounded with hills covered with wood, that T: having nd
guide but the fun, nor even this, unless I knew'well the
position of the time at that time of the day; and to add to
my misfortune, the weather proving very hazy, I was obli-
ged to return to my post by the seaside, and so backwards
the fame way I came. In this journey my dog surprised
a kid, and would have killed it, had 1 not prevented him.
As I had often been thinking of getting a kid or two, and
so raising a breed of tame goats to supply me after my am-
munition was spent, i took this opportunity of Beginning:
and having made a collar for this little creature, with a
string made of rope-yarn, 1 brought it to my bdwer, and
there inclosed and left him; and, having spent a month in
this journey, at length 1 returned to my own habitation.
Nobody can doubt of my satisfaction* when I returned
to my little castle, and reposed myself in my hammock.
After my journey I rested myself a week, which time I
Employed in making a cage for my pretty Poll, j now be-
gan to consider the poor kid L had left in the bower^ and [
immediately went to fetch it home. When I came there
I found the young creature almost Aarved; I gave it foffte
food, and tied it as before: but there was no occasion, for
it followed ms tike a dog; and, as [constantly fed it, it
became so loving, gentle, and fond, that it commenced one
os my domestics, and would never leave me.
The rainy season of the autumnal equinox being now
come, I kept the 30th of September in the most solemn
manner, as usual, it being the third year of my abode in
the island. I spent the whole day in acknowledging God's
mercies, in giving him thanks for making this solitary life
as agreeable, and less sinful, than that of human society;
and for the communications of his grace to my foul, in
supporting, comforting, and encouraging me to depend
upon his Providence, and hope for his eternal presence in
the world to come.
Indeed, I often did consider how much more happy I
was in this state of life, than in that accursed manner of
living I formerly used; and sometimes when hunting, or
viewing the country, the anguish of my foul would break
out upon me, and my very heart would fink within me, to
think of the woods, the mountains, the deserts I was in;
and how I was a prisoner locked up within the eternal
bars and bolts of the ocean, in an uninhabited wilderness,
without hopes, and without redemption. In this condition
I would often wring my hands, and weep like a child: And
even sometimes, in the middle of my work, this fit would
take me; and then I would fit down and sigh, looking on
the ground for an hour or two tog-ther, till such time as
my grief got vent in a flood ^f tears.
One morning as I was sadly employed in this manner,
I opened my Bible, when I immediately fixed my eyes
upon these words, u I will never leave thee, nor forsake
*' thee 1" Surely, thought I, these words are directed to
rae, or else why* should they appear just at a moment when
1 am bemoaning my forlorn condition? and if God does
hot forsake, what matters it, since he can make me morg
happy in this state of life, than if I enjoyed the greatest
splendor in the world? But while I was going to return
God thanks for my present state, something seemed to shock
my irfind, as if it had thus said; Unworthy wretch; cant
you pretend to be thankful for a condition, from which
you would pray to be delivered! Here I stopt;—and tho*
1 could not fay, I thanked the Divine Majesty for beings
there, yet I gave Gud thanks for placing tomf view my
fr£ robin#q n c bl trsoæ* 4$
foemer mut£e of life, .and grafting me a true knowledge of
repentance. And whenever I opened or shot the Bible*
I bleiled kmd Providence, .that directed my good friend
in England to &nd it among my goods without any order*
and for assisting me to save it £mm the power of the raging
ocean.
And now beginning my third year, my several daily em*
ploy mentl were these: First\ My doiy to Heaven, and xli-
ligently reading: the Holy Scriptures, which,I did twice op
thrice every dav i $ec ndly, Se^khag provision with my gun*
which commonly took me tip, when it did not rain* t^ness
hours every morning: Thirdly, The ordering, coring, pre-
serving, and cooking what I killed, or catched for my
supply, which took me up.great part of the day: for, in
the middle os the day, the sun tiekag in its height, it was
£0 bat, that I could, not stir out; :so that I bad only but
lour hours in the eve,nit>g to work in : and then the want
of tools* of assistance, and ikiil, wasted a great deal of time;
to little purpose. I was no less than two and forty days
making a board fit for a long ilielf, which two sawyers,
with their tools and sa-w pit, would have cut off the same
tree in half a day. It was of a large tree, as my board
waslake broad. I was three days iti cutting it down, and
two more in lopping off the boughs, and reducing it to a
piece of timber. This I hacked and hewed off" each fide*
till it became light to movs 5 then I turned it, made onfe
fide of it smooth and flat.as a board from eiid to end, thea
turned it downward, cutting the other fide, till I brought
the plank to be about three .inches thick, and smooth ?ort
both iides. Any body may judge my great labour and fa-
tigue in such a piece of work.; but this. I went through with
patience, *s-«aisojrutny.other things that my;circumstances
made necessary for roe .to,do.
The harvest months, November and December, were
ftow at hand, in;which I had the pleasing prospect of a very
good £uop. But here I met with a new .misfortune-; for
she goats and hares, having tasted of the sweetness of the
blade, kept it so short ihat it had not strength to flioot ap
fntoafialk. To prevent this, I inclosed, it with a*h«d^#
end by day ihot some of 1 its devojurers; and my dag^which
I had tied to: the field*gate, keeping barking all night, so
frightened those creatures, thatT gouentirely rid of them.
Bat no sooner did J get *id os these, than other enemies
appeared» toJiit, wMe flecks.of several som of birds,
C
wh'6 dnly waked till my back was turned, torfcm me; $o
mucfo did this provoke me, that I kt fly, and Msied th*ee
Of the malefactors-; a ad afterwards served them as they do
notorious thieves in England, hung them Up in chains as a
terror to others. And* indeed, so good an effect had this
that they not only forsook the corn, but all that part of the
ifland/sd long as these criminals hung there.
t My corn having ripened apace, the tatter end of I>e~
cember, which was my second harvest, I reaped it with a
scythe, made of one of my broad swords. I had no fa-
tigue in cutting down my first crop it was so slender. The
ears I carried home in a basket, rubbing it with my hands,
instead of threshing it: and when the harvest was over,
found my half peck of feed produced near two bushels of rice,
and two bushels and a half of barley. And now I plainly
foresaw, that, by God's goodness, I should be furnished
with bread; but yet I was concerned, because I knew not
how to grind or make meal of my corn, nor bread, neither
knew how to bake it. I would not, however, taste any of
the <:rop, but resolved to preserve it againft next season, and*
in the mean while, use my best endeavours to provide my-
self with other food.
But where were my labours to end? The want of a
plough to turn up the earth, or shovel to dig it, I conquer-
ed by making me a wooden spade. The want of a harrow
I supplied myself, with dragging over the corn a great
bough of a tree. When it was growing, I was forced to
fence it; when ripe to mow it, carry it home, thrasti it,
part it from the chaff, and save it. And, after ail, I
wanted a mill to grind it, sieve to dress it, yest and salt to
snake it into bread, and an oven to bake it. This set my
brains to work to find some expedient for every one of these
necessaries against the next harvest* 4 <
And now having more feed, my first care was to pre-
pare me mere land. I pitched upon two targe flat pieces
of ground near my castle, for that purpose in which I
sowed my seed, and fenced it with a good hedge. This
took me up three months: by which rime the wet season
coming on, and the rain keeping me within doors, I found
several occasions to employ myself; and, while at work,
used to divers myself in talking to my parrot, learning
him to know and speak his own name Poll, the first wel-
come word I ever heard spoke in the island. I had been a
long time contriving how vo make earthen vessels,, whkh #
©F ftOilNSON ORtJSOH.. 5I
wanted extremely: and when I considered the heat of the
climate, I did **o| dpubt but if I could find any such clay,
I might botch up a pot, strong enough, when dried in the
sun, to bear handling, and to hold any thing that was dryr
as corn, meal* and other things
To be Ihort* the clay I found,; but it would occasion the
most serious person to smile* to 4ee what awkward ways I
took, and what ugly mi fh a pen things I made; how many
either fell out-or cracked by the violent heat of the fun,
and fell in pieces when they were removed $ so that I think
k was two months time before I could perfect any thing:
and even then but two clumsy things in imitation of earthen
jars. These* however, I very gently placed in wicker
baskets, made on purpose for them, and between the pot
and the baskets, stuffed it full of rice and barley straw, and
these I presumed woujd hold my dried corn, and perhaps
the meal when the corn was bruised. As for the smaller
things, I made them with better success; such as little
round pots* flat dishes, pitchers, and pipkins, the fun ba-
king them very hard.
Yet fHH I wanted one thing absolutely necessary* and
that was an earthen pot, not only to hold rhy liquid, but
also to bear the fire, which none of these could do. It once
happened, that as I was putting out my sire* I found therein
a broken piece of one of my vessels burnt as hard as reck,
and red as a tile. This made me think of burning some
pots; and having no notion of a kiln, or of glazing them
with lead* I fixed three large pipkins, and two or three
pots in a pile one upon another. The fire I piled round
the outside, and dry wood on the top, till I saw the pots in
the inside red hot j and found that they were not crackt at all;
and when I perceived them perfectly red, I let one of them
stand in the fire about five or six hours* till the clay melted.
by the extremity of the heat, and would have run to glass,
had 1 fuf&red it; upon which I stacked my fire by degrees*
till the redr.efs abated; and watching them till the morn-
ieg, I found I had three very good pipkirts, and two
earthen pots, as well burnt and fit for my turn as I could
desire, c
>No joy could be greater than mine at this discovery.
fm after this, I may fay, I wanted for no fort of earthen
ware. 1 filled one of my pipkins with water to boil me
fome Tneat, which it did admirably well, and with a piece
of kid I made me some good broth, "as well as my circum-
stances would afford me at that time,
Qz
Ishe-ifeirt concerrr I had was to get rile a stone-ftisrtario
best fofneJcorn in,-instead of a mill to grind it. Here in-
.deed I was at a great loss, as not being fit for a.stone-cut-
ter ;: and many, days I spent to find out a great stone big
enough to cut hollow and make Jit for a mortar, and strOhg
eaoogh to bear the-weight of a pestil, and that would break
the c$ra'wk&out fi4&ng it with ftrid. /But all the stones of
the Marrd being of a -mouldering nature, rendered iny
search fruitless; and ttveri 1 resolved to look out for a great
block of-hatfd wood, wMch havlrig found, I formed it with
itiy ax arid harhWer* anti then, with-irviinite labour, made
a hollow* in it^ju'st'as the Indians of Brazil make their
canoes. lWhen I hail finished'this, I made a great pestil
of ir6n wood, afid then laid them ,up against my succeeding
hardest,
My tiQHt business was to ^rnake me;a £ete, to fist my
meal, and part it from the b*an and huik. Having ho
fine thin canvas to search the meal through, I could not
tell what fco*d@. What linen I had was reduced to rags:
I had goats' hair enough, but neither tools to work it, not
did I ktK>w hew to 'spin it: At length I remerribered I had
feme rkc'lMothk of-calico or muslin of the sailors, which I:
had bffcug'ht-JcHBt-of the stw-p, and with these 1 made three
small sieve^prp^er enfcsgh for the work.
I C6rrte! now to-ettnfider the baking part. Thewant of
an oven I supplied by making some earthen paris very'
broad but not deep. When 1 had a mind to bake, I made
a great fire upon the hearth, the tiles of which 1 had made
myklf; and w^en the wodd was burnt into live coals, I
spread them over k, till it-became very hot; the-n sweep-
ing them av^ay, I se* down my Idas es, £nd whelming dSWft
the eartheti £ots upon them, dtew the ashes and coa4s-aM
around the ^utfides of the pt>ts lo centirme the heat; a-&d
in this marker T&aked-my barley loaves, as well as if I had
been a complete* pastry-cook, a^d also made of-the*ice se-
veral cakes and puddings,
Jt is riowondir that these things took me up the best
p&rt of-a year$ - stttee what: intermediate time I had was be-
stowed in managing iny new harvest and huibandry; for irr
the proper season-4I reaped my corn, carried it home, and
kid it-«p$n:the ear in my large baskets, till I had iittie-ta

increased- so much, that it produced me twenty febmets of

le freely, but was thinking how to enlarge my barn*,' and
resolved to sow as. much at a time as would be sufficient for
me for a whole-year.
All this while, the prospect of land, which shad seen
£rom the .other side of the island; ran in my mind. I still
medicated a deliverance from this place,-though the fear
of greater misfortunes might have deferred me fr&m it.—
For, allowing thai. 1 had attained that, place, I'run the ha-
zard of beieg killed and-eaten b.y. the devouring -caanibais;
and if they vvere not so, yet I might be slain, as other Eu-
ropeans had been, who fell into their.hands. Notwith-
standing ail this., my thoughts • ran continually upon that
share. I now wished far m.y boy Xary, and the long-boat,
with the shoulder as mutton fail: I went to the (hip's boat
that had been cast a.great way on the shore in the late storm.
She was removed bat a little; but her bottom!being turn-
ed up by the impetaouty. and fury ofthe waves and wind,
I fell to work with all the strength I had, with lexers a**d
rollers I had cut from i\\£ wood, to turn her, £nd repair
the damages she had soilamed. This work took me up
three or four weeks, when finding my little strength all in
vaip, I fell to undermining it by digging away the sand,
and. so to mabe k fall down, setting pieces of. wood to
thrust and guide it in the fall. Bat after this was done, I
was still unable to stir it up, or to get under it, much less
to move it forward towards the water, and so i was forced
to give it over.
This disappointment, however, did not frighten me. I
began to.think whether it was not possible for me to make
a canoe or perigua, such as the Indians make of the trunk
of a tree. But here f lay under particular inconveniences;
want of tools to make it, and want of hands to move it ia
the. water when it was made. However, to work 1 went
upon it, stopping all the inquiries [ could make, with this,
very simple answer I made to myself, Let's first make it,
I'll warrant i'll find some way or other to get it along
when it is done.
1 Erst cut down a cedar-tree, which was Eve feet ten
inches diameter at the lower part next the stump, and four
feet eleven inches diameter at the end of twent)-uvo feet,
after which it lessened for a space, and then parted into
branches. .Twenty days was I a hacking and hewing this
I ee a.t the bottom, fourteen more in cutting off the
branches and limbs, and a whole month in shaping it like
c3
the ^bottom of a boat. As for the inside, I was three weeks
with a mallet and chissel, clearing it in sach a manner, as
that it was big enough to carry twenty-fix men, mock
bigger than any canoe I ever Taw in my life, and conse-
quently sufficient to transport me and all my effects to that
wished-for more J so ardently desired.
'Nothing remained now, but, indeed, the greatest diffi-
culty to get it into the water, it lying about one hundred
yards from it. To remedy the first inconvenience, which
was a rising hill between the boat and the creek, with won-
derful pains and labour I dug into the bowels of the earth,
and made a declivity. But when this was done, all the
strength I had was as insufficient to remove it, as it was when
J attempted to remove the boat. I then proceeded to mea-
sure the distance of ground, resolving to make a canal, in
order to bring the water to the canoe, since I could not
bring the canoe to the water. But as this seemed to be
impracticable to myself alone, under the space of eleven or
twelve years, it brought me into some iort of considera-
tion: so that I concluded this also to be impossible, and the
attempt altogether vain. I now saw, and not before, what
stupidity it is to begin work before we reckon its costs, or
judge rightly our own abilities to go through with its
performance.
In the height of this work my fourth year expired, from
the time I was cast on this island. At this time I did not
forget my anniversary ; but kept it with rather greater de-
votion than before. For now my hopes being frustrated,
I looked upon this world as a thing I had nothing to do
with -, and very well might I fay, as Father Abraham said
unto Dives," Between thee and me there is a gulph fixed."
And indeed I was separated from its wickedness too, hav-
ing neither the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eye, nor the
pride of life; I had nothing to covet, being lord, king,
and emperor over the whole country 1 had in possession,
without dispute and without controul; 1 had loadings of
90m, plenty of turtles, timber in abundance, and grapes
above measu;e. What was all the rest to me? the money
i had lay by me as despicable dross, which 1 would Mdtg
have given for a gross of tobacco' pipes, or a hand mill t^
griqd my corn: in a word the nature and experience of
tneie things dictated to me this juft reflection: That the
good things of this world are no farther good to us, thaij
tiiey are tor our use; and that whatever we iftay neap uj$
C*:, HQ£i,)NTSQ N„ C Ruso>v 5'/.
to; give to' others^ we can but enjoy as. much a$ we use, aa^f
no mpre. , ,
These thoughts rendered my mind more easy than usual.
Every time I fat dovyn to meat, I did it with thankfulness,
admiring the providential hand of God, who, in this wil-
derness had spread a table to me. And now I considered
what I enjoyed, rather than what I wanted, compared my*
f resent condition with what I at first expected itmpuld be;
owl should have done, if 1 had got nothing out of the
ship; that I must have perished before I had caught fish or
turtles; or lived, had I found them, like a mere savage,
by eating them raw, and pulling them in pieces with my
claws, like a beast. I next compared my station to that:
which I deserved : how undutiful I had been to my parents;
how destitute of the fear of God; how void of every thing
that was good; and how ungrateful for those abundant
mercies 1 had received from Heaven, being fed as it were,
by a miracle, erven as great as Elijah's being fed by ra-
vens; and cast on a place where there is no venomous
creatures-to poison or devour me; in short, making God's
tender mercies matter of great consolation, I relinquished
all sadness, and gave way to contentment.
As long as my ink continued, which with water I made
last as long as I could, I used to minute down the days of
the month, on which any remarkable event happened,—-
And,
First, I observed, that the same day I forsook my parents
and friends, and ran away to Hull, in order to go to sea,
the same day afterwards in the next year, I was taken and
made a stave by the Sallee rovers:
That the very day I escaped out of the wreck of the ship
in Yarmouth roads, a year after, on the fame day, I mao's
lay escape from Sallee in my patron's sidling-boat:
And, on the 30th of September, being the day of the
year I was born on, on that day twenty-six years after,
was I miraculousty saved, and cast alhore on this island.
The next thing that wasted after my ink, was the bis.
cuit which I had brought out of the ship, and though I as-
lewed myself but one cake a day, for above a twelvemonths
yet I was quite out of bread for near a year, before I go:
any corn of my own.
^ In the next place, my clothes began to decay, and my
linen hadr been gpne long before. However, I had pre„
ttrved about three dozen of the sailors chequered shins
 '•' -   c4' 
which proved a great refreshment to me, when the viofenS
beams of the fun would not suffer me to bear any of the
seamen's heavy watch-*coa*s; which made trie turn tailor,
and, after a miserable botching manner, convert them to
jackets. To press rye my head, I made me a cap of goat-
skins, with the hair outwards to keep out the rain; which
indeed served me so well, that afterwards J made me a
waistcoat and opened kneed breeches of the fame: And then
I contrived a fort of an umbrella, covering it with skins,
which not only kept out the heat of the fun, but rain .also..
Thus being easy, and settled in my mind, my chief happi-
ness was to converse with God, in moil heavenly and com-
fortable ejaculations.
For five years after this I cannot fay any extraordinary
thing occurred to me. My chief employment was to cure
my raisins, and plant my bailey and rice, both of which I
had a year's provision beforeha-nd. Bat though I was dis-
appointed in my first canoe, I made it, at intermediate times,
my business to make a second, of much inferior size; arid
it was two years before I had sirriihed it. But as 1 per-
ceived it would no wife answer my design of sailing to the
ether more, my thoughts were confined to take a tour
round the iOand, to fee what further discoveries 1 could
make. To this intent, after having moved her to the wa-
ter, and tried how she would fail, I fitted up a little mast
to my boat, and made a fail of the ship's fail that lay by
me. I then made lockers or boxes at the end of it, to put
in necessities, provision, and ammunition, which would
preserve them dry, either from rain or the spray of the
sea; and in the inside of the boat, I cut me a long hcllovv
place to lay my gun in, and to keep it dry made a flag to
hang over it. My umbrella 1 fixed in a step in the stern*
like a mast, to keep the heat of the fan off me. Aud now
resolving to see the circumference of my little kingdom,
I victualled my stiip for the voyage, putting in two dozen
of roy barley, bread loaves, an earthen pot full of parched
ike, a little bottle of rum, half a goat, powder and shot,
and two watch-coats. It was the 6th of November, in
the 6th year of my reign, or captivity, that I set out in
this voyage; which was much longer than i expected, be-
ing obliged to put farther cut, by reason of the rocks that
lay a great way in the sea. And indeed so much did these
rocks surprise me, that 1 was for putting back, fearing that
if I ventured farther it wcuski bt out of my power to *e*
tarn* In this uncertainty I cajne to an anchor just cfF Ihore,
to which 1 waded with my gun on my ihouldex/ and then
climbing up a hill, which .overlooked that .point, I saw the
full extem of U, and so resolved to ran all hazards.
In this profped from the hill, I perceived a violent cur-
rent ruling to the east;, comir*g very close to the point;
which I the more carefully observed, thinking it danger-
pus, and that when I came to it, I aught be drove into the
sea by its force, aad not able to return to the island; and
certainly it must have been so, had 1 not made this obser-
vation; for on the other side was the like current, with
this difference, that it set off at a greater distance; and I
perceived there was a (hong eddy under the land; so that
rnv chief business was to work out of the first current, and
conveniently get into the eddy. Two days I staid here,
the wind blowing very briskly E. S. E. which being con-
trary to the cjurseDt,. Leaves a great breach of the sea upGn
the point; so it was neither fit for me to keep too near ths
shore, on account of the breach; nor stand at. too great a
4istar.ce, for fear of the streams. That night the wind
abating, it grew so calm, that 1 ventured cut.;- and here I
may be a mcnurrrent to all rash and ignorant pilots; for I
was no sooner come to the point, and not abexve the boat's
length from shore, but I was got into a dzsp water, witha
current like-a mill, which drove my boat along so violently,
that it was impossible for me to keep near the ed^e of it,
but forced- me more and more out frcm the eddy to the
If ft of me; and all I could do with my. paotdles were uie-
Jefs, there being no wind to help me; ^;
Now I begain to teok upon my M fas quite loft, since as,
the current ran^on both, fides of the island, I was very cesn
tab they mult>>k a,gain, and then I bad no"-hope? but of
perishing for waajt in <the iea,. afoer what provifiou I bad-

when now I wo«W give the whole w&rjdlo bc-thither again}
WhiJe 1 wa$ thus pomplaining! I fou^^ myself to be dri*
Y§n ajjout mq leagues into jt,he sea; 4^W^?r> J laboured
till my strength was far spent, to keep my boat as far north >
as possibly I could, to that fide of the current where tftd
eddy lay on. About noon I perceived a little breeze of
wind spring up from the S. S. E. which overjoyed my
heart; and was still more elated, when, in about half an
hour, 11 blew a gentle fine gale. Had any thick weather
sprung up, I had been lost another way; for having no
compass on board, I should never have found the way to
steer towards the island, if once it had disappeared; but it
proving the contrary, I set up my mast again, spread my
sail, and stood away northward, as much as I could, to
get rid of the current. And no sooner did the boat begin
to stretch away, but I perceived, by the clearness of the
water, a change of the current was near; for, where it
was strong, the water was foul; and where it was clear,
the current abated. To the east, I soon saw, about half a
mile, a breach of the sea upon some rocks, which caused
it again to separate; and as the main force of it drove
away more southwardly, leaving the rocks to the north-
east, so the other came back by the repulse of the rocks,
making a sharp eddy, which retureed back again to the
northwest with a very swift stream.
They who have experienced what it is to be reprieved
upon the ladder, or to be saved from thieves, just going to
take away their lives, or such as have been in the like ca-
lamities with my own, may guess my present excess of joy;
how heartily I ran my boat into ihe stream of this eddy,
and how joyfully I spread my sail to the refreihing wind,
standing cheerfully before it, with a smart tide under foot.
By the assistance of this eddy, I was carried above a league
hjome again, when being in the wake of the island, be-
Jwjxt the two currents, I found the water to be in a fort of
3 stand. About four o'clock in the afternoon, I reached
within a league of the island, and perceived the points of
the rock, which caused this disaster, stretching out, as I
obferved before, to the southward, which throwing off the
current more southwardly had occasioned another eddy to
the north. But having a fair brisk gale, I stretched across
this eddy, and in an hour came within a mile of the shore,
where I soon landed to my unspeakable comfort; and after
an humble prostration, thanking God for my deliverance,
with a resolution to lay all thoughts of escaping aside, 1
brought my boat safe to a little cove, and laid me down
to take a wclcAint'fepose. When I awoke, I was consi%
dttrmg how; I might get my boat home; and coasting along
the (here, I came to a good bay, which ran up to a rivulet or
irook, where finding a safe harbour, I stowed her as safe
as if ihe had been in a dry dock made on purpose for her.
I now perceived myself not far from the place where be-
fore I had travelled on foot; so taking nothing with me,
except my gun and umbrella, I began my journey, and in
the evening came to my bower, where I again laid me
down to rest. I had not slept long before I was awakened
in great surprise, by a strange voice that called me several
times, "Robin, Robin, Robinson Crusoe, poor Robin I
•' Where are you, Robinson Crusoe r Where are you?
%i Where have you been ?'*
So fast was I asleep at first, that I did not awake tho-
roughly; but half asleep and half awake, I thought I
dreamed that somebody spoke to me. But, as the voice
repeated Robinson Crusoe several times, being terribly af-
frighted, I started up in the utmost confusion; and, no
sooner were my eyes fully open, but I beheld my pretty
Poll fitting on the top of the hedge, and soon knew that ic
was he that called me; for just in such bewailing language
I uied to talk and teach him; which he so exactly learned,-
that he-would sit upon my singer, and lay his bill close tc*
my face, and cry,« Poor Robinson Crusoe, where are you >
"where have you been? how came you here?" and such
like prattle I had constantly taught him. But even though
I knew it to be the parrot, it was a great while before I
could adjust myself; being amazed how-the creature got
thither, and that he mould six about that place, and no
where else. But now being assured it could be no other
than my honest Poll, my wonder ceased* andreachin? out
my hand,^and calling familiarly Poll, the creature came
to me, and perched upon my thumb as he was wont, con-
stantly prating to me with « Poor Robinson Crusoe, ami
*' how did I come-here, and where had I been i'% as if the
bird was overjoyed to fee me; and so I took him home
i&ioag with me. -
I was now pretty well cured of my ramblW to sea; yet
I could wish my boat, which had cost me so much, troutfe
and pains, on this side the island once more, but'wMcK in-
deed was impracticable. I therefore began to leaa ;. yery
retired life, living near a twelvemonth in a very conte.urd
manner, wanting for nothing except conversation. As to
mechanic labours, which my neceffities oblige'd me to/ t
fancied I cculd, upon occasion, make a tolerable carpestef
were the poor tools I had to work withal but good. Be-
sides, as I improved in my earthen ware, I contrived to
make them with a wheel, which I found much easier and
better, making my work mapely, which before was rude
and ugly. But, I think, I was never.so elevated with my5
own performance or project, than for being able to make a
tobacco-pipe, which though it proved an awkward clumsy
thing, yet it was very found, and carried the smoke per-
fectly well, to my great satisfaction.
I aTo improved my wicker ware, making me abundance
Of necessary baskets, which though not very handsome,
were very handy and convenient to fetch things home in^
as also for holding my (lores, barley, rice and other pro-
visions.
My powder beginning to fail, made me examine after
what manner I should kill the goats or birds to live on after
it was all gone. Upon which 1 contrived many ways to
ensnare the goats, and fee if I could catch them alive, par-
ticularly a she-goat with young At last I had my desire,
for making pitfalls and traps baited with barky and rice,.
I found one morning* in one of them, an old he-goat, and
in the other three kids, one male, the other two females.
So boisterous was the old one, that J could not bring
Vim away. But I forgot the old proverb, " That hunger
** will tame a lion:" Fcr had I kept him three or four
days without provisions, and then given him some water,
with a little corn he would have been as tame as a young
kid. The other creatures I bound with strings together 5
but I had great difficulty before I could bring them to my
habitation. It was some time before they would feed;
but, throwing them sweet corn it so much tempted them#
that they began to be tamer. From hence I concluded*
that if I designed to furniih myself with goat's stelh, when
my ammunition was spent, the tamely breeding them up,
like a flock of flieep, about my settlement, was the only
method I could take. I concluded also I roust separate the
wild from the tame, or else they would always run wild as
they grew up; and the best way for this, was to have some
inclosed piece os ground, well fenced, either with a hedge
or pale, to keep them so effectually, that those within might
not break out, or those without break in. Such an under-
taking was very great for* one pair of hands; but as there
was an absolute necessity for doing it, roy first care was XQ
find a convenient piece of ground where there was likely
to h% herbage for them to eat, water to drink, and covet
to keep them from the fun.
Jrkre again I gave another instance of my ignorance and
inexperience, pitching upon a piece of meadow land fa
large, that had Tindosod it, the hedge or pale must have
been at least two miles abe*ut. Indeed had it been ten,
miles, I had time enough to do it in; but then I did not
consider that my geats would be as wild in so much com-
pass, as if they had had the whole island, and consequently
as difficult for me to catch them. This thought came into
my head, after I had carried it on, I believe, about fifty
yards ; I therefore altered my scheme, and resolved to inclose
a piece of ground about one hundred and fifty yards in
length, and one hundred in breadth, sufficient enough far
as many as would maintain me, till such time as my flock
increased, and then I could add more ground. I now vi-
gorously prosecuted my work, and it took me about three
months in hedging the first piece ; in which time I tethered
the three kids in the best part of it, feeding them as near
me as possible, to make them familiar: and indeed I very
often would carry some ears of barley or a handful of rice,
and feed them out of my hand; by which they grew so
tame, that when my inclosure was finished, and [ had let
them loose, they would ran after me for a handful of corn.
This indeed answered my end; and in a year and a half's
time I had a flock of about twelve goats* kids and all;
and in two years after, they amounted to forty-three, be-
sides what 1 had taken and killed for my sustenance. After
which 1 inclosed five several pieces of ground to feed them
in, with pens to drive them into, that I might take then*
as I hadoccasion.
In this project I likewise sound additional blessings; for
I not only had plenty of goat's stem, but milk too, which
ia my beginning 1 did not so much as think of. And,
indeed, thougn 1 had never milked a cow, much less a
goat, or seen butter or cheese made, yet, after some essays
and miscarriages, I made me both, and never afterwards
wanted.
How mercifully can the omnipotent Power comfort his
creatures, even in the midst of their greatest calamities f
How can he sweeten the bitterest providences, and give u*
reason to magnify him in dungeons and prisons j what a
bounteous table was here spread in a wilderness for roe,-
where I expected nothing at first but to perish for hunger.-
Certainly a Stoic would have smiled to see me at dinner,
There sat my royal majesty, and absolute prince and ruler
©f my kingdom, attended by my dutiful subjects, whom*
if 1 pleased, J could either hang, draw, quarter,give them
liberty, or take it away. When I dined, I seemed a king,-
eating alone, none daring to presume to do so till J had
done. Poll, as if he had been my principal court favo-
rite, was the only person permitted to talk with me. My*
old, but faithful dog, now grown exceedingly crazy, and
who had no species to multiply his kind upon, continually
fat on my right hand; while my two cats fat on each side
of the table, expecting a bit from my hand* as a<principal
mark of my royal favour. These were not the cats I had
brought from the ship;- they had been dead long before,
and interred near my habitation by mine own hand. Bat
one of them, as 1 suppose, generating with a wild cat, a
couple of their young I had made tame; the rest run wild
into the woods, and in time grew so impudent as to return
and plunder me of my stores, till such time as I (hot a
great many, and the rest left me without troubling me any
more. In this plentiful manner did I live, wanting for
nothing but conversation. One thing indeed concerned
me,, the want of my boat; I knew net which way to get
her round the island. One time I resolved to go along the
shore by land to her; but had any one in England met
such a figure, it would either have affrighted them, or
made them burst into laughter; nay, 1 could not but smile
myself at my habit, which I think in this place will be very
proper to describe.
The cap 1 wore on my head, was great, high, an4
fltapelese, made of a goat's skin, with a flap or pent-house
hanging down behind, not only to keep the sun from me^
feat to shoot the rain off from running into my neck, no-
thing being more pernicious than the rain falling upon the
$efh in these climates. I had a short jacket of goat's ikin,
whose hair hung down such a length on each side, that it
reached down to the calves of my legs. As for shoes and
jffockings, I had none, but made a semblance-us some*
thing, I know not what to call them; they were made
tfce buskins, and laced on the fides like spatterdashes, bar-*
barously shaped like the rest of my habit. 1 had a broad
belt of goat's skin dried, gjrt round; me with a cpuple ot
of *OB1nso*n Crusoe, 65
thongs, instead of buckles; on each of which, to supply
the deficiency of sword and dagger, hung my hatchet and
saw. I had another belt, not so broad, yet fastened in the
same manner, which hung over my shoulder, and at the
end of it, under my left arm, hung two pouches, made of
goat's skin, to hold my powder and (hot. My basket I
carried on my back, and my gun on my shoulder; and
over my head a great clumsy ugly goat's skin umbrella,
which, howevtr, next to my gun, was the most necessary
thing about me. As for my face, the colour was not so
swarthy as the Mulattoes, or might have been expected
from one who took so little care of it, in a climate within
nine or ten degrees of the equinox. At one time my beard
grew so long that it hung down about a quarter of a yard;
but as J had both razors and scissors in store, 1 cut it all
off, and suffered none to grow, except a large pair of Ma-
hometan whiskers, the like of which I had seen wore by
some Turks at Salee, not long enough indeed to hang a
hat upon, but of such a monstrous size, as would have
amazed any in England to have seen.
But all this was of no consequence here, there being
none to observe my behaviour or habit. And so, without
fear and without controul, I proceeded on my journey, the
prosecution of which took me up five or six days. I first
travelled along the sea shore, directly to the place where I
first brought my boat to an anchor, to get upon the rocks;
but now having no boat to take care of, 1 went overland %
Bearer way to the fame height that I was before upon $
when looking forward to the point of the rock, which lay
out, and which I was forced to double with my boat, I was
amazed to fee the sea so smooth and quiet, there being noi
ripling motiorf, nor current, any more than in other places.
This made me ponder some time to guess the reason of it,'
when at last I was convinced that the ebb setting from the
West, and joining with the current of water from some*
great river on shore, must be the occasion of these rapi$
streams; and that, consequently, as the winds blew morfc
westwardly, or more southwardly, so the current came the
rearer, or went the farther from the shore. To satisfy
my curiosity, 1 waited there till evening, when the timS
of ebb being made, i plainly perceived from the rock the*
current again as before, with this difference, that it rani
farther off, near half a league from the shore 5 whereas*
in my expedition, it set dose upon it, furiously hurrying
$% L1FS A.ND APVEIJTUPS
#te and my canoe along with it, which at another time it
would not have done. And now I was. convinced, that*
by observing the ebbing and flowing of the tide, I might
-easily bring my boat round the island again. B-ut when I
began to think of putting it in practice, the remembrance
of the hte danger struck me with such horror, that I chan-
ged my resolution, and formed another, which w#a^ mov§
*afe, though more laborious.; and this-was to make a«no-
ther canoe, and so have one for one fide of the island, and
one for the other.
I had now two plantations in the island; the iirfl my
little fortihxatior.,. fort, or castle, with many large and spa-r
cious improvements; for by this time 1 had enlarged the
cave behind me with several little caves, one with ano-
ther, to hold my baskets, com, and straw, 1 be piles
with which I made rny wall were grown so lofty aud great
as obscured my habitation. And near this conamodious-
%i\d pleasant settlement, lav my well-cultivated, and im-
proved corn-fields, vvhich kindly yielded me their fruit
in the prcper season. My second plantation was that near
my country-feat, or little bower, where my grapes flourish-
ed, and where* having planted many stakes, I made in-
closures- for my goats, so strongly fortified by labour and
time, that it was much stronger than a wall, and conse-
quently impossible for them to break through. .*s for my
bower itself, 1 kept it constantly it repair, and cut the trees
in such a manner, as made them grow thick and wild, an4
form a most delightfql shade, in t)ae ceatre of this stood
my tent, thus erected. I had driven soar piles in th$
ground, spreading ever it a piece of the ship's fail; be-
neath vvhich i made a fort of a couch with the ferns of th§
creatures 1 had staki, and other things j and having lai4
thereon one of the sailor's blankets, which I had fevcfl
from the wrecks of the (hip, and covejiqg myself with .a
greaj watqh-coat^ I took up this,; place for my cquntry tre*
^eat.
. Very frequently from this settlement o'id I use to visit
Eiy boat, and keep her in very good order. And some-
times I would venture in her a cast or two from tbore, bu£
bo farther, lest either a strong current,, atsudden flsrmjl
vv'md, or some unlucky accident should hurry me,from the
iftand as before. But now I entreat you* attention, whJMi
I proceed to inform ycu of a»e\¥, but japft ferpri£ng i$pm
©i Jife which b«re befel mjet
You may easily suppose, that after having been here so
Jong, nothing could be more amazing than too see a human
creature. One day it happened, that, going to mv boat,
I saw the print of a man's naked foot on the shore, very
evident on the sand, as the toes, heels, and every part of it.
Had I seen an apparition in the moil frightful shape, I
could not have been more confounded. My wiilings ears
gave the strictest attention. I cast my eyes around, but
couid satisfy neither the one nor the other. I proceeded
alternately to every part of the more, but with eq.ua! effect;
neither could I fee any other mark, though the sand about
it was as susceptible to take impression, as that which was
so plainly stamped. Thus, struck with confusion and horror,
I returned to my habitation., frightened at every bush and
tree, taking every thing for men; and possessed with the
wildest ideas! That night my eyes never closed J forced
nothing but the most dismal imaginations, concluding it
inuit be the mark cs the devil's foot which I'had seen.
For otherwise how could any mortal come to this iiland?
where was the ship that transported them? and what signs
of any other footsteps? Though thele seemed vtry strong
reasons for such a supposition, yet (thought 1) why should
the devil make the print of his scot to no purpose, as I can
fee, when he might ftave taken other ways to have terriikd
me? why should he leave his mark on the other side of the
island, and that too on the sand, where the surging waves
of the ocean might sooa have erased the impression. Surely
this action is not consilient with the (ubtilty of 6acan, said
I to mysdf; but rather must be some dangerot-s creature,
seme wild savage of the main land over against me, that,
venturing too far in the ocean, has been driven here, either
by the violent currents or-contrary winds; and not caring
to stay on this desolate island, has gone back to sea again.
Happy, indeed, said I to myself, that none of the sa-
vages had seen me in that place: yet I was not altogether
without fear, lest, having fouod my boat, they should re-
turn in numbers and devour me, or at least carry away all
my corn, and destroy my flock of tame goats. I« a word,
all my religious hopes vanished, as though 1 thought God-
would not now protect me by his power, who had so won-
derfully preserved me so long.
What various chains of Providence are there in the life
of man? How changeable are our affections* according to
different circumstaxces: We love, co-day, what we. haie
€6 LXtfS AND ADV-X»,XU.iCrs
to-morrow; we shun one hour, what we seek the next.
This was evident in me in the most conspicuous manner:
For I, who before had so much lamented my condition, in
being banished from all human kind, was now even ready
to expire, when I considered that a man had set his foot on
this desolate island. But when I considered my station of
life decreed by the infinitely wise and good providence of
God, that I ought not to dispute my Creator's sovereign-
ty, who has arr unbounded right to govern and dispose of
his creatures as he thinks convenient; and that his justice
and mercy could either puni(h or deliver me: I fay, when
I considered all this, I comfortably found it my duty to
trust sincerely in him, pray ardently to him, and humbly
resign myself to his divine will,
One morning, lying on my bed, these words of the sa-
cred writings came into my mind, *' Call upon me in the
** day of trouble, and 1 will deliver thee, and thou shalt
V glorify me.'* Upon this sentence, rising more cheer-
fully from my bed, I offered up my prayers in the most
heavenly manner; and when I had done, taking up my
Bible to read, these words appeared first in my sight: —*
*• Wait on the Lord, and be of good cheer, and he shall
"strengthen thy heart: Wait, 1 fay, on the Lord." Such
divine comfort did this give me, as to remove all cause
of sadnesa upon tnat occasion.
Thus, after a world of apprehensions and fears, for three
days and nights, I at last ventured out of my castle, and
milked my goats one of which was almost spoiled for
want of it. I next (though in great fear) visited my
bower, and milked my stocks there also; when, growing1
bolder, I went down to the shore again, and measuring the
print of the foot to mine, to see, perhaps, whether I myself
had not occasioned that mark, I found it much superior iqr
krgeness; and so returned home, now absolutely convinced
that either some men had been amore, or that the island"
must be inhabited, and therefore that I might be surprised4
before I was aware.
I now began to think of providing for my security, and
resolved in my mind many different schemes for that pur-
pose. I sirit. proposed to cut down my inclosures, and turn
roy tame cattle wild into the woods that the enemy might
not find them, and frequent the island in hopes of killing
the iame. Secondly, 1 was for digging up my corn-fields
for the rcry seme reason. And, lastly, I concluded to d$-
molisli mybower/lest, seeing a place of human contrivance,
they might come farther and find out and attack me in my
little castle.
Stock notions did the fear of danger suggest to me; and
I looked I thought Hke the unfortunate king Saul, when
not only oppressed by the Philistines, hut also forsaken by
God himself. And, it is strange, that a little before, hav-
ing entirely resigned myself to the will of God, I ihould
now have little confidence in him, fearing those more who
could kill this fading body, than him who could destroy
my immortal foul.
Sleep was an utter stranger to my eyes that night; yet
nature, spent and tired, submitted to a silent repose the
next morning, and then joining reason with sear, I consi-
dered that this delightful and pleasant island might not
be so entirely forsaken as I might think; but that the in-
habitants from the other shore might fail, either with de~
iign or from necessity, by cross winds; and, if the latter
circumstance, I had reason to believe they would depart
the first opportunity. How ever, my fear made me think of
a place for retreat upon an attack. I now repented that I
had made my door to come out beyond my fortification;
to remedy which, I resolved to make me a second one: I
fell-to work, therefore, and drove betwixt that double row
of trees, which I planted above twelve years before, se-
veral strong piles, thickening it with pieces of timber and
old cables, and strengthening the foot of it with earth
which I dug out of my cave; I also made me seven holes,
wherein I planted my muskets like cannon, fitting them
into frames resemblng carriages. This being finished
With indefatigable industry, for a great way every where*
1 planted sticks of osier like a wood, about twenty thou*
sand of them, leaving a large space between them and my
wall, that I might have room to see an enemy* and that
they might not be sheltered among the young trees, if they
offered to approach the outer wall. And, indeed* scarce
two years had pasted over my head, when there appeared
a lovely shady grove, and in fix years it became a thick
wood, perfectly impassible. For my safety, I left no ave-
nue to go in or out; instead of which I set two ladders*
one to a part of a rock which wa> low, and then broke in*
leaving room to place another ladder upon that; so that
when I took these down, it was impossible for any man to
descend without hurting himself; and if they had, they
would still be at the outside of my. outer wall. But \vhife
1 took, all .tbese measure* of human prudence for my own
preservation I was not altogether unmindful of other affairs*
To prefenne my stock of tame goats, that the enemy should
rot take all at once, I looked out for the most retired
part of the island, which was xhe place where I had lost
myself before-mentioned; and there fending a clear piece
of land, containing three acres, furround-ed with thick
woods, I wrought so hard, that in Ids than a month's time,
1 fenced it so well r.aund, that my stacks were very wtll
secured in it, and I put therein two he goats and ten ihs
^orres.
All this labour was occasioned, .purely by fearful appre-
hensions, on account of feeing the print of a man's foot.
And not contented yet \yvJk\ what. I had dane, I searched
for another place towares the- west point of the ifland,
-where J ruight also retain another fILck. Tnen wander-
ing on this errand mere to the west-of the iS.u>d thnn ever
J had yet done, and calling my eyes towasds the fes, mo-
thought I perceived a. boat at a great distance; bat could
rot possibly- tell what it was for want of my perspective
glass. I considered then it was no strange thing to fee the
print of a-.man's foot; and concluding them cannibals,
blessed God for being cast on the other fids ©i the iiland.
•where, iione of the savages., as 1 thought* ever came. But
when I came down the hill to the shore,, which was the
£• W. point of the island, I was soon coniirm&d- in roy
©pinion; nor can-any one describe my horror and amaze*-
Kient, when I saw the ground spread with sculls, hands,
feet, and bones of hu pi art bodies ;, and, particularly, I per*-
peived a space like a circle, in the midst of which had been
a fire, about whkh I conjectured these wretches fat, and urv
aa*urally sacrificed and devoured tlieir fellow creatures.
, The horror and loathsomeness of this dreadful spectacle^
both confounded my fenses, and made me discharge front
my stomach in an excessive manner. I then returned to-
wards my habitation-; and, in my way thither, {hedding
floods of tears, and falling down on my bended knees,
gave God thanks for making iny nature coatrary to these
wretches, and delivering me so long out of their hands*.
Though reafoo and my long rdide-nce here had assured
tne, that these savages never came up to the thick woody,
part of the country, and that I had no reason to be appre^
i|c&Jivfc of a discovery; yet &ch a^i abhorrence did I still
my three plantations; I mean my castle, country-feat, and
inclosure in the woods. And though in process of time
my dreadful apprehensions began to wear away, yet my
eyes Were'sitore vigilant set fear of being surprised, a*id I
Was very caucious of siring my gun, lest, being heard *by
those creatm-ek, they mould proceed to attack me. I re-
-solved, however, manfully to lose my life if they did, arid
went armedwith three pistols stuck in my girdle, which,
added to she description I have given of myself before,
made me look with a very formidable appearance.
Thus ' my circumstances for some time remained very
calm and undisturbed; and when I compared-my condi-
tion toothers, I found it far from being miserable. And, in-
deed, would all persons compare their circumstances, not
with those above themi but with those innumerable unhappy
objects'beneath them, 1 am sere we mould not hear those
daily murirfurings and complainings that are in the world.
For my part, J wanted bat few things. Indeed, the terror
which the savages had put me in, spoiled some inventions
for my own conveniences. One of my-projects was to
bfew me some beer; a very whimsical one indeed, when
it is considered that I had neither ca&s fuiHcient, nor could
I make any to preserve it in; neither had I hops to make
it keep, yest to make it work, nor a copper or kettle to
 moke it boil. Perhaps, indeed, after some years, I might
bring this to bear, as I had dorie-other things. But now
my inventions were placed another way; and day and night
I' could think of nothing but how T mig^ht destroy some of
these cannibals, when proceeding-to their bloody enter-
tainments-;-and so saving a-victim from feeing sacrificed,
that he n^ght after' become my servant. Many were my
contrivances after this purpose, and as many more objec-
tions occurred, after 1 hatched them. I once contrived to
-dig a hole under the place where thernrade their fire, and
put therein five or ffec pounds* of gunpowder* which would
consequently blow up all those that were near it; but then
I was toth to spend so much upon them, lest it should not
^o that certain execution I could defire, and but only
affright, and not kill them. Having laid'this design aside*
I again proposed'to myself to lie privately in ambush, in
some convenient plate, with my three guns double loaded*
and let fly at thenrin the midst of their dreadful ceremony;
and feaving killed two or three of them at every shot, fall
yo LIFE AN I> ADlVENJ-VlEI
upon the rest suddenly with my three pistols, an*! notkt
one mother's fen escape. This imagination pleased my
fancy so much that I used to dream of it b the night time.
To put my design in execution, I was not long in seeking
for a place convenient for my purpose^ where unfeeftl.
might behold every action of the savages. Here I placed
roy two muskets, each of which was loaded with a brace of
Hugs, and four or five smaller bullets about the size of pis-
tol bullets; the fowling-piece was charged with near a
handful of the largest swan-shot, and in every pistol were
about four bullets. And thus all things being prepared,
no sooner would the welcome light spread over the ele-
ment, but, like a giant reftvjhed <witb ivine, as the Scripture
has it, would I issue forth from my castle, and from a lofty
hilU three miles distant, view if I could fee any invaders
approach unlawfully to my kingdom. But having waited
in vain two or three months, it not only grew very tire-
some to me, but brought me to some consideration, and
made me examine myself, what right I had to kill these
creatures in this manner
If (argued I to myself) this unnatural custom of theirs:
be a fin offensive to Heaven, k belongs to the Divine Being?
who alone has the vindictive power in his hands, to ihowet
down his vengeance upon them. And perhaps he does so,
in making them become one another's executioners. Or^
if not, if God thinks these doings just, according to the
knowledge they conceive, what authority have I to pretend
to thwart the decrees of Providence, which has permitted
these actions for so many ages, perhaps from almost the
beginning of the creation? They never offended me, what
right have I then to concern myself in their shedding oa&
another's blood; And, indeed, I have since known, thejf:
value no more to kill and devour a captive taken in war*,
than we do to kill an ox or eat mutton. I then concluded,
it necessarily followed, that these people were no morel
murderers than Christians, who many times put whokt
troops to the sword, after throwing down their arms.—*
Again I considered, that if I fell upon them, 1 should be;
as much in the wrong as the Spaniards, who had commit-
ted the greatest barbarities upon *these people who had ne-
ver offended them in their whole lives; as if the kingdom
of Spain was eminent for a race of men without common
compassion to the miserable, a principal sign of the most
generous temper: these considerations made me pause, and
O^ 'fed'STKSON €RUSOE. ft
stade me think 1 had taken wrong measures in my resolu-
tion: J now argued with myself, it was better for me never
to attack, but to remain undiscovered as long as I possibly
could; that an opposite conduct would certainly prove de-
structive; for as it was scarcely to be supposed I could kill
them all, I might either be overpowered by the remaining,
of that some escaping, might bring thousands to my certain
deduction. And, indeed, religion took their part so
much as to convince me how contrary it was to my duty
to be guilty of stiedding human blood, innocent as to my
particular, whatever they are to one another; that I had
nothing to do with it, but leave it to the God of all power
and dominion, as 1 said before, to do therein what seemed
convenient to his heavenly wisdom. And, therefore, on
iny knees I thanked the Almighty for delivering me from
blood guiltiness, and begged his protection thai I might
never fall into their hands.
Thus giving over an attempt which I had rashly begun,
I never ascended the hill on that occasion afterwards: I
only removed my boat, which ^a-y on the other side of the
island, and every thing that belonged to her, towards the
east, into a little cove, that there might not be the least
(hadow of any boat near, or habitation upon the island.—
My castle then became my cell, keeping always retired in
it, except when I went out to milk my (he goats, and order
my little stock in the wood, which was quite out of danger:
for sure I was that these savages never came here with
expectations to find any thing, and consequently never wan-
dered from the coast >t however, as they might have several
times been on Ihore, as well before as after my dreadful
apprehensions, A looked b »ck with horror to think in what
state 1 might have been, had I suddenly met them slender-
ly armed, with one gun only loaded with small shot; and
how great would have been my amazement, if, instead of
feeing the print of one man's foot, 1 had perceived fifteen
or twenty savages, who having once set their eyes upon
me, by the fw:.ftness of their feet would have left me no
possibility of escaping? These thoughts would sink my
very foul* so that I would fall into a deep melancholy, till
such time as the consideration of my gratitude to the Di-
-vine Being moved k from my heart. I then fell into a
contemplation of the sacred springs of Providence, and how
wonderfully we are delivered, when insensible of it; and
**l*€n intrkated in uncertain mazes or labyrinths of doubt
?£f LIFE A-K13 A^VENTti&ES
or hesitation, what secret hint directs m in the tight wa\?#
when we intended to go cut of it; stay, perhaps contrary
to cur business, fen/e, or inclination. Upon which, I fixed
within me this as a certain rate, never to disobey, thpse se-
cret impressions of the mind, to the acting or not acting my
thing that offered, for which I yet could afDgn no reason.
But let it be how it will, the advantage of this conduct
very eminently appeared in the latter part of my abode en
this island j latna stranger in deterrainiog whence theso
secret jntimations of Providence derive; yet raethinks they
are'not only fosse proof of the converse of spirits* but also
of the secret communicators they are supposed to have
with those that have not palled through the gloomy vale of
death.
These anxieties of mind, and the care of my preserva-
tion, pot a period to all future inventions and contrivances*
either for accommodation or convenience. I now cared
not to drive a nail, chop a stick, fire a gun, ©r-make a
sire, Jest either the noise should be heard, or the smoke
discover me. And on this account I used to hurn my
earthen .ware primely in a cave which I found in the wood*
and'which I m&4t convenient for that purpose; the prin-
cipal cause %hat brought me here was to make charcoal, so
that I might bake and dress my bread and meat wkhojut
any danger. At that time a curious accident happened
me, which I &all now relate.
While f was cutting down some wood for making my
charcoal, I, perceived a cavity behind,a very thick branch
cf underwood. Curious to look into it, I attained its
mouth, and perceived it su#ciem for me to stand upright
in. But-when I bad -entered, and took a further view,
two rolling mining eyes, like, flaming stars, seemed- to dart
themselves at me,; so that i made all the hafte put that I
could, as not knowing whether it was the devil ora mon-
ster that had taken his residence in that place. When I
recovered a little from my surprise* I called myself a thou*
sand fbois, for being-afraid to fee ,the devil pae memmt*
who iad now lived almost twenty years in ;the most retire i
solitude* And the^c^re seaming all the courage I fcad, I,
took, a starring ;ftre4 rand,, mi in I rju&ed agatn. iha^i
act proceeded above three Aeps* when I was more affright*,
ed than before; far then I heard a very loiid sigh, iik«
that of a human creature in t.he greatest agony, succeeded
with a broken noise, resembling words half expressed*
and then a broken sigh again. Stepping back, Lcrd \
(thought I to myself) where am I got, into w*iat enchanted
place Have I plunged myself, such as are reported to con-
tain miserable captives, till death puts an end to their sor-
row f 'And, indeed, in such great amazement was I, that
it struck me into a cold sweat; arfd had my hat been on my
head, I believe my hMr would have moved it off. But
again encouraging myself with the hopes of God's pro-
tection, I proceeded forward, and, by the light of my sire-
brand, perceived it to be a monstrous he-goat, tying 05*
the ground, gasping for life, and dying of mere old age.
At first I stined'him,'thinking to drive him out, but the
poor ancient creature -strove to get upon his feet, but was
not able; so I e'en In him lie still to affright the savages,
should they venture into this cave, I now locked round
me and found the place but small and shapeless. At the
farther fide cf it, I perceived a fort of an entrance, yet so
low, as must oblige nie to"creep upon my hands and knees
to it; A, having no candle, I suspended my enterprise till
the next day, and then I came provided with two Urge
ones of my own making.
Having crept upon my hands and feet, through this strait,
I found the roof higher up, I think about twenty feet.
But surely moru! never saw such a glorious fight before!
The roof and walls of'this cave reflected a hundred thou-
sand lights to me from my two candles, as though they
were indented with shining gold, precious ftones, or fpark-
I'ng diamonds. /-r.J indeed it was the m* it delightful ca-
vity or protto cf it j kind "that could bedeiired, though en-
tirely d-ik. /He floor was dry and lc\dt and had a kind
of giavi 1 upon it';' no nauseous venomous creatures to be
seen there, neither any damp Or wet about it. I could find
ro fault but in the entrance, and I began to think that even
this might be very necessary for my defence, and therefore
resolved to" make it my most principal magazine. I brought
Either two fowling-pieces, and three muskets, leaving tirily
five pieces at my ratlle, planted in the "nature of cannon,
Cf the barrel of gunpowder, which I took up out of the
sea, I brought away about sixty pounds of good powder,
which was not damaged; and this, with a gf ear quantity
of lead for bulletr, 1 removed from my caflle* to this retreat,
nowIbitifiecf both by art and1 mature. '•" '''

were'skid to live rh tkre's'a-Esd holesfamon» the rock.% m-
D
acceaible to any but themselves/or, at least, a most dan-
gerous to attempt. And now 1 despised both the cunning
and strength o<s the savages, either to find me out or to-
hurt me.
But I must not forget the old goat, which caused my laf;e
dreadful amazement. The poor creature gave up the ghost
the day aster my discovery; and it being difficult to drag
him out, I dug his grave, and honourably entombed him in
the fame place where he departed* with as much ceremony
as any Welch goat that has been interred about the high
mountain Penmanmawr.
I think I was now in the twenty-third year of my reign,
and -my thoughts much easier than formerly, having con-
trived several pretty amusements and diversions to pass
away the time in a pleasant manner. By this time my
pretty Poll had learned to speak English, and pronounce
Sis words very articulately and plain; so that for many
hours we used to chat together after a familiar manner,
and he lived with me no less than twenty-six years. My
dog which was nineteen years old, sixteen of which he lived
with me, died some time ago of rrere old age. As For my
cats, they multiplied so fast, that I was forced to kill or
drive them into the woods, except two or three which be-
came my particular favourites. 'Besides these, I continu-
ally kept two or three household kids about me, which I
learned to feed out of my hand, and two more parrots
which could talk indifferently, and call Robinson Crusce,
but not so excellently as the first, as not taking that pains
with them. I had also several sea-fowls which I had
wounded and cut their v\ings; and growing tame, they
used to breed among the low trees about my castle walls,
all which made my abode very agreeable.
But what unforeseen events suddenly destroy the en-
joyment, of this uncertain state of life, when we least t.x~
pect them 1 It was now the month of December, in the
southern solstice, and particular time of my harvest, which
required my attendance in the fields; when going out
pretty early one morning, before it was day-light, there
appeared to me, from the fea "shore, a flaming light, about
two miles from me at the*east end of the island* where I
had observed some savages liad been before, not on the
other fide, bat to my great affliction,"it was on my side the
island.
Struck with a terrible surprise, and my usual apprehen-
fions, that the savages would perceive my improvments,
I .-returned directly to my castle, pulled the ladder after
me, making all things look as wild and natural as I pcstl*
bly could. In the next place, I put myself into a posture
of defence, loading my muskets and pistols, and committing-
myself to God's protection, I resolved to defend myself
till my last breath. Two hours after, impatient for intel-
ligence, I set my ladder up to the side of the hill, where
there was a flat place, and then pulling the ladder after
me ascended to the top, where laying myself on my belly,
with my perspective glass, I perceived no less than nine
naked savages, fitting round a small sire, eating, as I sup-
posed human flesh, with their two canoes haled on shore,
waiting fer the flood to carry them off again. You cannot
easily express the consternation I was in at this sight, espe-
cially seeieg them near me; but when I perceived their
coming must be always with the current of the ^bb, I be-
came more easy in my thoughts, being fully convinced
that I might go abroad with security all the time of flood,
if they were not before larked. And, indeed, this proved
just as I imagined; for no sooner did they all take boac
and paddle away, but the tide trade N. W. Before the/
went off, they danced, making ridiculous postures, and
gestures for above an hour, all staik-naked; but whether
men or women, *or both, I could not perceive. When I
saw them gone, I took two guns upon my shoulders, and
placing a couple of pistols in my belt, with my great sword
hanging by my side, I w&nt to the hill, where at first I
made a ^discovery of these cannibals, and then saw there
?had heen threecanoes more of the savages on shore at that
place, which with the rest were making over to the main
iatid.
? * But nothing could be more horrid to me, when going
to the place of sacrifice, the blood, the bones, and other
;mangled parts of human bodies appeared in roy .light;
and so fired was I with indignation, that I was fully re-
Halved to be revenged on the first that came there* though
I lost my life in the=execvuion. It then appeared to roe,
that the visits which they Jioake to this iiland are not very
frequent, it being fifteen months before they came again;
but still I was very uneasy, by reason of the dismal ap-
prehensions of their surprising me unawares; nor dared I
D z
offer to sire a gun on that side of the island where ihty
used to appear, lest, taking the alarm, the savages might
return with many hundred canoes, and then God knows
in what manner I should have made iny end. Thus was [
a year or more before I saw any os these devouring can-
nibals again.
But to wave this, the following accident, which demands
attention, for a while eluded the force of my thoughts in
revenging myself en those Heathens.
On the 16th of May (according to my wooden calendar)
the wind blew exceedingly hard, accompanied with abund-
ance of lightening and thunder all day, and succeeded by a
very stormy night. The seeming anger of the Heavens
made me have recourse to my Bible. Whilst I was seri-
ously pondering upon it, I was suddenly alarmed with the
noise of a gun, which 1 conjectured was fired upon the
ocean. Such an unusual surprise made me start up in a
minute, when, with my ladder, ascending the mountain as
before, that very moment a flash of fire presaged the report
cf another gun, which 1 presently heard, and found it was
from that part of the sea where the current drove me away.
I could not but then think, that this must be a ship in dis-
tress, and that these were the melancholy signals for a
speedy deliverance. Gteat, indeed, was my sorrow upon
this occasion; but my labours to assist them must have
proved altogether vain and fruitless. However, I brought
together all the dry wood that was at hand, and making a
, pretty large pile, set k en fire on the hill. I was certain
they plainly perceived it, by their firing another gun as
soon as it began to blaze, and after that several more from
the same quarter. All night long I kept up my fire: and
when the air cleared up, I perceived something a great
way at Jea, directly E. but could not distinguish what it
was, even with my glass, by reason the weather was so very
soggy out at sea. However, keeping my eyes directly fixed
upon it, and perceiving it did not stir, J presently con-
cluded it must be a ship at anchor, and so very hasty I was
to be satisfied, that taking the gun, I went to the S. E.
part of the island, to the fame jocks where I bad been
formerly drove away by the current; in which time the
weather being perfectly cleared up, to my great sorrow,
1 perceived the wreck of a ship cast away upon those hid-
den recks I found when 1 was out with my boat; j?ml
which, by making a kind of an eddy, were the occasion
of my preservation.
Thus, what is one min's safety is another's ruin; for
undoubtedly this snip had been driven on them in the night,
the wind blowing strong at E. N. £. Had they perceived
the iiland, as I now gueiiei they had not, certainly, in-
stead of firing their guns for help, they would rather have
ventured in the'r boat, and saved themselves that way. I
then thought, that perhaps they had done so, up>n seeing
my lire, and were cad away in the attempt; lor I per-
ceived no boat in the (hip. But then I again imagined,
that, perhaps, they had another vessel in company, which,
upon signal, saved their lives, and took the bsat up: or
that the boat might be driven into the main ocean, where
these poor creatures might bs in the most miserable condi-
tion. But as ail these conjectures were very uncertain, I
could do no more than commiserate their distress, and
tfeank God for delivering me, in particular, when so many
perished in the raging ocean.
When I considered seriously every thing concerning this
wreck, and could perceive no room to suppose &ny of them
saved, I cannot explain, by any possible force of words,
what longings my foul felt on this occasion, often break-
ing out in this manner: "C that these; had been but two or
"three, nay even one person saved, that we might have
"lived together, conversed with, and comforted one anu-
tf ther!" and lo much were my deiires moved, that wnen
I repeated these words, " Oh 1 that there had been but
"one!" my hands would clench together, and my fin-
gers press the palms of my hands ib cl^fe, that, had any
toft thing been between, it would have crushed it involun-
tarily, while my teeth would strike together, and set against
each other so strong, that it required some tim* for me to
part them-
Till the last year cf my being on tmVisland, I never knew
whether or not any had been saved out of this ship. I had
the afHiction, some time after, to fee the corpse of a drown-
ed boy come on more, at the end of the island which wa5
next the shipwreck.; there was nothing on him but a sea.
man's waistcoat, a pair of opened-kneed linen drawers, and
a blue linen shirt, but no particular' mark to guess what
nation he was of. In his pocket were two pieces of eight,
and a tobacco-pipe, the last1 of which I preferred muoi
more than 1 did. the first. And now the calmness of the
D4
sea tempted me to venture out in my"-boat tet thfs wr^cle
roc only to get something necessary out-of the stiip, bus
perhaps some living creature might be on' board, whofe
life I might preserve. This had such an influence open
my mind, that immediately I went home, and prepared
every thfng necessary for the voyage, carrying on board
my boat provisions of all forts, with a good quantity of
ram, fresti water, and a compass: so putting oss, I pad-
dled the canoe along the shore, till I came at last to the
north-east part os the-island, from whence ) was to launch
into the ocean; but here the Currents ran so violently, and
appeared so terrible, that my heart began to sail me; fore-
seeing that if I was driven into any of these currents, I
:might be carried not only out of reach or sight of the
island, but even inevitably loll in the boiling surges of the
ocean.
So oppressed was I at these troubles, that I gave over
my enterpr'.ze, sailing to a little creek on the more, where
stepping put, I set me down on a rising hill, very pensive
and thoughtful. I then perceived that the tide was turned,
F;nd the flood came on, which made it impracticable for
me to go out for so many hours. To be more certain how
the sets of the tides or currents Liy when the flood came in,
} ascended a higher piece of ground, which overlooked the
sea both ways; and here I found that as the current of
the ebb set oat close by the south point of the island, so the
current of the flood set in cl.se by the shore of the north
side; and all that I had to do, was to keep to the north of
the island in my return.
That night I reposed myself in my canoe, covered with"
my watch-coat, instead osa blanket, the heavens being my
tester. I set out with the arst os the tide full no.th, till I
felt the benefit of the current, which carried me at a great
rate eastward, yet not with such impetuosity as before, as .
to take from me all government of my canoe; so that in
two hours time I came up to the wreck, which appeared ta-
me a most melancholy sight. It seemed to be a Spanistv
vessel hf its building, stuck fast between two rocks; her
stern and quarter beaten to pieces by the sea; her main*
mast andferemast were brought off by the board, that is
broken ^ff short. As I appro? ched near, I perceived a dog*
chi board, who, feeing me coming, yelped and cried, aad^
rid sooner did I call him, but'the poor creature jum^d-tos
the sea, out of which I took him up, almost famiihed with
hunger and thirst ; so that when I gave him a cake cf bread.

bu-rst himself,, bad I suffered him,: . . • '.,_
The first%ht I met with in the ship, were two rpeiv
drowsed in the cook rooai or forecastle, inclosed in on?
another's arms: hence I very probably supposed, that when'
the vessel.stiuck in the storm, so high and incessantly did
the waters break,in and over her, that the men not being
able to shear? u,; were strangled by the constant ruining ja
of the waves. There were several casks of liquor, whs-
ther wine or brandy I could not be, positive, which lay in
the bwer hold, as were plainly perceptible by the ebbing
out of the water, yet were too large for me to pretend lo
meddle with; likewise I perceived several chests, which I
supposed to belong to the seamen, two os which I got into
roy boat, without examining uhat was in them. ILid the
stern of the ship been fixed, and the fjrepart broken off, I
should have made a very prosperous voyage; since, by
what I after found in these two chests, I cjuld t«ot other-
wise conclude, but that the ship must have abundance of
wealth on board; nay, if I must guess by the course (he
steered, (he must have been bound from the Buenos Ayres,
or the Rio de la Plata, in the southern parts Gf America,
beyond the Brazils, to the Havannah, in the guJp'h ;of
Mexico, and so perhaps to Spain. What became of the
*est of the sailors, 1 could not certainly tell; and all her
riches signified nothing at that time to any body.
Searching farther, I found a caik> containing about
twenty gallons, full of liquor, which, with some labour, I
got into my boat; in her cabin were several muskets, wnich
Flet remain there, but took away with me a great powder
horn, with about four pounds of powder in it. J took also
a fire-(hovel and tongues, two brass kettles, a copper pot to
make chocolate, and a gridiron; all which were extremely
necessary to me, especially the fire-shovel and tongs. And
so with this cargo, accompanied with my dog, I came
away, the tide serving for that purpose; and the same
evening, about an hour within night, 1 attained the island,
after the greatest toil and fatigue imaginable.
That night I reposed my wearied limbs in the boat, re-
solving the next morning to harbour what I had gotten ia
xhy new-found subterraneous grotto; and not to carry my
cargo home to my ancient castle. Having refreshed my-
iielf*. and got all my effects on shore, I next proceeded .to.
examine the particulars; and so tapping the cask, I found
the liquor to be a kind of rum, but not like what we had
at the Brazils, nor indeed near so good. At the opening
os, the chest, several things appeared very useful to me;
for instance, I sound in one a very fine case of bottles, con-
taining the finest and belt forts of cordial waters; each
bottle held about three pints, curlojsty tipt with silver. I
found also two pots full of the choicest sweetmeats, and
two more which the water had utterly spoiled. Taere
were likewise several good stiirtsexceedingly welcome to me,
and about one dozen and a half white linen handkerchiefs
and coloured neckloths, the former of which was abso-
lutely necessary for wiping my face in a hot day ; and, in
the til, I found three bags of pieces of eight, about eleven
hundred in all, in one of which, decently wrapped up in a
piece vf paper, were six doubloons of gold, and some small
bars and vyedges of the fame metal, which I believe might
weigh near a pound. In the other chest, which I guessed
to-belong to the gunner's, mate, by the mean circumstances
which attended it, J fpixad only some clothes of very .little
value, except about two pounds of sine glazed powder, in
three-iiafks,> kept, as 1 believe, for charging.their fowling-
pieces on any occasion; so, that, on the whole, I had no
great advantage by this voyage. The money was indeed
a$ mere dirt to me, useless and unprofitable, all which I
would have freely parted with for two or three pa'r of Eng-
lish (hoes and stockings; things that for many years i had
not worn, except lately those which I had taken off the feet
cf those unfortunate men I found drowned in the wreck,
yet not.so good as English shoes either for ease or service.
I. also found in the seaman's chest about fifty pieces of eight
in ipyzhi but no gold; so concluded that what I took
from the, first belonged to an officer, the latter appearing
to have a much inferior person for its owner. However,
2$ despicable as the money seemed, I likewise lugged it to
32y cave, laying it up securely, as 1 did the reit of my
cargoj and after I had done all this, I returned back to
my boat, rowing and paddling her along till I came to my
old. harbour, where 1 carefully laid her up, and so made the
best cf my way to my castle. When I arrived there, every
thing seemed fase and .quiet: so that now my only business
was to repose myself-after my wonted manner, and take
care of* my domestic affairs. JJut though I might have lived
vtry easy, as wanting nothing absolutely needful; yet,
ftiil'lW more vigilant than usual upon accost 0/ the fe-
vVics, never going much abroad.; or, if I did, it was to
the east part of the island, where I was well assured that
the savages never came, and where I might not be troubled
to carrv that heavy load of weapons for my d^tenee, as 1
was obliged to do if I went the other way. ^
Two years did I live in this anxious condition, in all
which time, contrary to my former resolutions, my head
was filled with nothing but projects and designs, now t
misht escape from this island; and so much were my
wandering thought bent upon a rambling disposition that
had I had the same boat that 1 went from bailee in, 1
should have ventured once more to the uncertainty of the
raging ocean. .
1 cannot, however, but consider myself as one of the «n-
happy"persons, who make themselves wretched by their
dissatisfaction with the stations which God has placed them
in; for, not to take a review of my primitive condition,
and my father's excellent advice, the going contrary to
which was, as I may fay, my original lb, the following
mistakes of the some nature certainly had been the means
of my present unhappy station. Wnat-business had I to
leave' a fettled fortune, aud well stocked plantation, im-
prdvi-ig.and increasing, where, by this time, I might have
been worth a hundred thousand moidores, to tarn super-
oargo to Guinea, to fetch Negroes, when time and patience
would so much enlarge my stock at home, as to be able
so employ tluse whole more immediate business it was to
fetch them home even to my door?
JBu: as this is commonly the fae of yoang heads, fc, v
ferioys reflection upon the folly of, it ordinarily attends tne
exercise of future years,,when the,dear bought experience
of time teaches us repentance. Thus was it with me;
but notwithstanding, the thoughts of my deliverance ran
so strongly in my mind, that "it seemed to check.all the
dictates of reason and philosophy. And now to usher in
my kind reader with .greater pleasure to the remaining
pait of my relation, I flatter myself it will uot b^ taken^
amiss, to give him. an account of -my first conceptions of
the manner of escaping, and gpon^'hat foundation I laid
my foolish schemes.
Having retired to my castle, after my late voyage to the-
ihlp, my frigate laid op and secured, as usual, and my
coadiuoa.the same as before, except being richer, though
a-j. -
J hid as little occasion for riches as $e.^niliarr5 of Pern
had for geld, before the icruel Spaniardscame among
them: One night in March, being the rainy season, in
the four and twentieth year of my solitude, Tlay down to
ileep, very well in health, without distemper pain, er uri*
common uneasiness, either of body 6r mind; yet notwith-
standing, I could not compose myself to sleep all the night
Jong. AU this tedious while, it is impossible to Express
what innumerable thoughts came into my head. I traced
quite over the whole history of my life in rniniatme, from
my utmofl remembrence of things till I came to'this iflamd,
add then proceeded to examine every action and passage
that had occurred since 3 had taken possession of my king-
dom, in my reflections upon the latter, I was comparing
the happy posture of ray affairs in the beginning of my
reign, to this life of anxiety, fear and concerni since f
had discovered a print of a soot in the sand; that while
1 continued without apprehension, I was incapable of feeling
the dread and terror I n©w suffered. How thankful rather
ought I to have been for the knowledge of my danger,
since the greatest happiness one can be possessed of is to
have sufficient time to provide against it? How stupend-
ous is the goodness of Providence, which sets such narrow
bounds to the sight and knowledge of human nature, that
while men walk in the midst of so many dangers they are
kept serene and calm, by having the events of things hid
from their eyes and knowing nothing of those many dan-
gers that AirFOund them, till perhaps they are diffipated
and vanish away*
Wiun I came more particularly to consider of the real
danger I had for (y many years escaped ; how I had walked
about in the greatest security and tranquillity, at a time,
- perhaps, when everi nothing but the brow of a hill, a great
tree, or the common approach of night, had interposed
between me and the destructive fcands of the cannibals,
who would devour me with as good an appetite, as I would
a pigeon orxurfew; surely all this, I fay, could not but
make me sincerely th nkfJ to my great Preserver, whose
iinguiar protection I acknowledge with the greatest hu-
mility, ancl without whieh I must inevitably have fallen
into the cruel hands cf those devourers.
Having thus discussed my thoughts in thTe clearest man-
ner, according to my weak understanding, I next pro-
ceeded io conÆder the wretched nature of those destroying
ct Rsrrt*rspN c au a oh. 8.3y
images, by seeming, though with great reverence, to in-
squire,-why God'fhould give up any of his creatures tsjfuch
inhumanity, even to brutality itself, to devour its own kind?
but as this was rather nsatter of obstruse speculation, and as
roy miserable situation made me think this of mine the most
uncomfortable situation in the world, I then began rather
to inquire what part of the world these wretches lived in;
how far off the coast'was from whence they came; why
they ventured over so far from home; what kind of boats
conveyed them hither; and why I could not order myself
and my business so, that I might be as able to attain their
country, as they were to come to my kingdom?
But then, thought I, how (hall I manage myself when I
come thither? what will become of me if I fall into the
hands of the savages? or how (hall I escape from them,
if they make an attempt upon me? and supposing I mould
I50t fall into their power, what shall I do for provision, or
which way (hall I bend my course? These counter thoughts
threw me into the greatest honor and confusion imagina-
ble; but then I still looked upon my present condition to
be the most miserable that possibly could he, and that no-
thing could be worse, except death. For (thought 1)
could I but attain the shore of the main, I might perhaps
meet with some relief, or coast it along, as J did with my
boy Xury, on the African fhore> till I came to some inha-
bited country, where I might meet with same relief, or
fall in with some Christian ship that might take me in ; and
is 1 failed, why then 1 could but meet with death, which.
would put an end to all my miseries. These thoughts, I
muii confess, were the fruit of a distempered mind, an im-
patient temper made desperate, as it were, by long conti-
nuance of the troubles and disappointments I had met with
in the wreck, where I.hoped to have found so?ne living
pfrfon to speak to, by whom I might have known in what
place 1 was, and of the probable means of my deliverance.
Thusr while my thoughts were agitated, my resignation to
the will of Heaven was entirely suspended I'so that I had
jio power to six my mind to any thing, but to .the project
cf a voyage to the main land. And indeed so much was
I inflaxned upon this account, that it set my blood siito a -
fermrnt, and my pulse beat'high, as though I had Beea
in a fever y ,tiil nature being, as it were, * fatigued'land ex- .
haustc4 with the thoughts of it, made me-subaait fey self tg>^
^.£ient repose, . ;. - ::. •
In such a situation, it, is very strange, that I did n^t
dream of what I was so imcrj. upon; bat, instead of it, my
mind roved on a quite different thing, altogether .foreign*
J dreamed, that as I was issuing from my castle, one morning,
as customary, when 1 perceived upon the shore two canoes,
and,eleven savages coming to land, who had brought with.
them another Indjan,. wnom they designed, to, make a sacri-
fice of, in order to devour; but just as they were geiog t,o
give the fatal blow, methou^ht the poor designed victim
jumped away, and ran directly into my little thick grove
before my fortification, to abscond from his enemies, when
perceiving ihat the others did not follow him that way, I
appeared to him; that he humbly Jcneeled down before
me, seeming to pray for. my assistance; upon which I
jhowed him my ladder, made him ascend, carried him to
,xny cave, and he became my servant; and when I had
gotten this man, I said to myself, now surely I may have
some hopes to attain the main land; for this fellow will
serve me as a pilot, tell me what to, do, and where I must
go for provisions, what places to stiun, what to venture to,
and what to escape. But when I awaked, and found all
these inexpressible impressions of joy entirely vanished, I
fell into the greatest dejection of spirit imaginable.
Yet this dream brought m£ to reflect, that one sure way
ef escaping was to get a savage; that afer 1 had ventured
my life to deliver him from the blocdy j.^wsof his devourers,
the .natural fense he might have of such a preservation,
might inspire him with a Jailing gratitude and moil sincere
aiLci'on. But then this objection reasonably interposed:
how can I effect this, thought I, without I attack a whole
company of them, and kill them all f why mould 1 proceed
cm such a desperate attempt, which my icruphs before had
&ggelled to be unlawful I and indeed my heart trembled;
at the thoughts of so rr.uch blood, though it wsre a means
lo prcc~re my deliverance. JTis true, I might reasonably
enough suppose these n en to be real ennmies to my life,,
men who would devour me, was it in their power; so that
it was self preservation in the highest degree to free rayfels,
hy attacking them in my own defence, as lawfully as if
they were actually astauLing me; thrugh a-H these things,,
.1 /ay, seemed to me to be os the greatest weight, yet, as; I
j^ist: sai.4 before, the dreadful thoughts of iheddijag human
blood, struck such a terror to my soul, that it was. a loag
time feefexe I could reconcile myfeif ta k«
Bat how far will the ardency of desire prompt us on?
For notwithstanding the many disputes and perplexities I
had with myself, I at length resolved, right or wrong, to
get one of these savages int® my hands, coll what it would,
or even though I should tefe my life in the attempt. In-
spired with this firm resolution, I set all my wits at work,
to find cut what methods I mould take to answer my de-
sign: this, indeed, was so difficult a task, that I cor.li not
ptch upon any probable means so execute it: I, therefore,
resolved continually to be in a vigilant posture, to perceive
when the savages came on shore, and to leav3 the reft to
the event, let the opportunities offer as they would.
Such was my fixed resolutions; and accordingly I set
myself upon the scout, as often as I could, till such time
as I was-heartily tired of it. I waited for above a year
and a half, the greatest part of which 1 went out to the
west, and south west corner of the island, almost every day,
to lock for canoes, bat none appeared. This was a very
"great discouragement; yet, though I was very much con-
cerned, the tdge of my design was as keen as ever, and
the longer it seemed to be delayed, the more 'eager was I
for it: in a word, 1 never before was so careful*to shun the
loathing sight of these savages, as I was now eager to to be
with them; and 1 thought myself sufficiently able to manage
one, two, or three savages, if I had them, so as to make
them my entire staves, to do whatsoever i should direct
them, and prevent their being able at any time to do me
a mischief. Many times did I use to please myself with
these thoughts, with long and ardent expectations ;* but
'nothing presenting, all my dtep projected schemes and
Rumercus fancies vanished away, as though, while I re-
tained such thoughts, the decrees of Providence was such,
that no savages were to come near me.
About a year and a half after, when I was seriously
inuiing of sundry other ways how I should attend my end,
jane morning early 1 was very much surprised by Teeing
no less than five canoes all on shore together, on my fide
the island* and the savages that belonged to them all
landed, and out of my sigrit. Such a number of them
disconcerted all my measures; for, feeing so-in any boats,
each of which would con-tain fix, and sometimes more,
I could not tell what to think of it, or how to order my
measures, to attack twenty or thirty men single-handed;
'upon which, znuch dispirited $nd perplexed, May Hill ia
my caille; which, however, I put .in a proper postureibr-
an attack; and, having formerly provided all that was ne-
jcestary, was soon ready to enter upon an engagement, should
they attempt. Having waited for some time, ray impatient
temper would let me bear it no longer; 1 set my guns at
the foot of my. ladder, and, as usual, ascended up to the
top of the hill at two stages, standing, however, in such a
scanner, that my head did not appear .above the hill, so
that they could not easily perceive rae; and Jiere, by the
assistance of my perspective glass, I observed no less than
thirty in number around a fire,, feasting upon what meat
they had dressed: how they cooked it, or what it was, I
•could- not then perfectly tell; bat they were all dancing
*nd capering about the flames, using many frightful and.?
barbarous gestures.
But while, with a curious eye, & was beholding these
wre,tch?s, my spirits funk within me, when I perceived j
them drag two miserable creatures from the boats, to act
afresh the dreadful tragedy,,, as I supposed they had done
before. It was not long before»one of them fell upon the
iground, knocked down, as i suppose, with a club o* wooden
sword, for that was their manner; while two or three
ethers went immediately to work, cutting, him open for
their cookery,.and then fell to devour him as they hadi
done the former, while the last unhappy captive was left by.
himself, till such time as they were ready for him. The
poorcreature looked round him with a-.wistiful eye* trem-
bling at the thoughts i death; yet, feeing himself a little
at liberty, nature, that very mement^as it were, inspired
bim with hopes of life: He started away from them, arti
ran, with incredible swiftness, along the sands, directly to
that part of,the ejaast wheie.ray ancient and venerable castle
flood.
You may- welUmagine, J was dreadfully affrighted upon
this occasion,, when, as 1 thought,,they pursued him in a
whole body, all running towards my:palace. And now,
indeed, I, expected that part of my dream wag going to
be fulfilled, and that he would certainly fly to-my-grove
, for proiectkm; but, for the rest of my dream, I could de*
per^d nothing on it, that the savages would pursue him
thither, and find him there. However roy spirits begin-
mx\g to recover, I still kept upon my guards and I now.
plainly perceived, there were- but three men out of the
mmnber that pursued him* I was infinitely pleased witk,
"wliat swiftness the poor creature ran from his pursuers
gaining so much ground upon them, that I plainly per-
ceived, could he thus hold out for half an hour, there>\vas
not the least doubt but he would save his life from the
power of his enemies.
Between them and my castle there was a creek, that
very fame which I sailed into with all my effects from the
wreck of the stiip, on rhe steep banks of which 1 very
much feared the poor victim would be taken, if he could
not swim for his escape: But soon was 1 out of pain far
him, when I perceived he made nothing of r9 though at
full tide, but with an intrepid courage, spurred on by tr.e
sense of danger, he plunged into the stood, swimming over
in about thirty strokes, and then landing, ran with the
fame incredible strength and swiftness as before. When
the three pursuers came to the creek, one of them, who I
perceived could not swim, happily for his part, returned
to his company, while the others, with equal courage, but
much less swiftness, attained the other fide, as though they
were resolved never to give over the pursuit. And now
or never X thought was the time for me to procure me a
servant, companion, or assistant; and that I was decreed
by Providence to be the instrument to save this poor crea-
ture's life. I immediately descended my two ladders with
the greatest expedition; I took up my two guns, which, I
said before, were at the bottom of them, and getting up
again with the same haste toward* the hill, 1 made nearer
the sea. In a word, taking a short cut down the hill, I
interposed between the pursuers and pursued, hallooing
aloud to the lauer, who, venturing to look back, was, no
doubt, as rmich terrified at me as I at them. I beckoned
to him with my hand, to mum back, in the mean time
advancing touards the pursuers, and rushing on the fore-
inost, I knocked him down with the stock of my piece,,
and laid him flat on the ground. I was very unwilling to
iire Jest the refcVfhould hear, though at a distance* I question-
ed whether they could or no; and being out of fight of
the smoke, they could not easily hare known what Xo make
of it. The other savage seeing his fellow fall, stopped as
if he had been amazed; when, advancing towards him, I
could perceive him take his bow from his back, and, fix-
ing an arrow to it, was preparing to ihoot at me, and, with-
out dispute, might have lodged the arrow in my breasts
fcut, in %hh absolutely necessary case of self-preservation^ I
immedntely fired at him, and shot him dead, jail as his;
hard *as going to draw the fats! firing. All this while,
the savage who had fled before stood still, and had the sa-
tisfaction to fee his enemies killed, as he thoaght, who de-
signed to take away his life; so affrighted was he with the
lire and noise of ray piece, that he stood as it were like
Lot's wife, fixed and hnmaveable, without either fense cr
motion. This ubliged me to halloo to him again,,making
the plainest signs I could tp him to draw nearer. I per-
ceived he understood those tokens by his approaching to
me a Mule way, when, as if afraid I fhoald kill him too,,
he step ted again. Several times did he advance, and as
©Hen stop in this manner, till, coimng more to my view, I
perceived him trembling, as if he was to undergo the fame
fate. Upon which I locked upon him with a smilmg
countenance, and still beckoning to him; at length he
came close to me and kneeled down, kissed the grout/d,
laid his head upon it, and taking me by the foot, set it
upon his head; and this, as 1 understood afterwards, was
a token of swearing to fcfe my stave for ever. I took him
up, arid, making much of him, encouraged him-in the
"best manner I could. But my Work was not yer finished;
"for i jxrctived the savuge whom I knocked down, was
not killed, but stunned with the blew, and began "to come
Ho himself. Upon which I pointed to my new servant, and
showed him that his enemy was not yet expired, he spoke.
Tome words to me, but which I could not undcrihir.d; ytt
being trie first found of a man's voice I had heard for above
twenty-five years, they were very pleating to me. But
there uas no time for reflection now, the wounded savage
recovering himself so far as to sit upon the ground, whkh^
made ftty poor prisoner a® much afraid as before; to put
him out of which fear, 1 presented my o;her gun at the
irtan, with "an intent to ihoot him; but my savage, for so
1 must now call him, prevented my firing, by making a
"motion tome, to lend him my sword, w*iich htng naked
"in my belt by^uy side. No sooner did I grant hli request,
"but away he runs to his enemy, znl at one blow cutoit" hts
head %as dextrooily as the, most 'accomplisticd executioner
-in Germany cculd have clone; for, h seems, these crea-
'tares make use of wooden swords made-of hard weed
•*hkh will bear edge enough to cut off heads and arms at.
:<me blow. When this valorocs exploit was done, he comes*
*o me latching, fcs-a token of triumph, -delivered me mf-
sword again, with abundance os surprising gestures, laying
it, along with the bleeding and ghastly head os the Indian,
at my feet.
The greatestastonishment that my new servant conceived
was the manner of killing the savage ac such a distance,
without a bow and arrow ; and such was his longing desire
to know it, that he first pointed to the dead carcase, and
then made signs to me to grant him leave to go to him.
Upon which I bid him go, and, as well as I could, made
him sensible I granted his request-. But when he came
there, how wonderfully was he struck with amazement!
First, he turned him on one fide, then on another, wonder-
ing he could perceive no quantity of blood, he bleeding
inwardly; and after sufficiently admiring the wound the
ballet had made in his breast, he took up his bow and ar-
rows, and came back again; upon which I turned to go
away, making my signs to him to follow, lest the rest mis-
sing their companions, might come in pursuit of ihem,
psnd this I found he understood very well, by his making
me understand that his (Jt^ga was to bury them, that they
might not be seen if it happened; and which by signs
again I made him sensible 1 very much approved of. Im-
mediately he fell to work, and never was grave-digger
more dextrous in the world than he was; for in an in slant,
as I migh: fay, he scraped a large hole in the sand with
his hands, sufficient to bury the first in; there he dragged
him, and without any ceremony he covered him over; in
Ike manner he ki\Q(i the other ; so that I am sure no un-
dertaker could be more expert in his business; for all this
was done in less than a quarter of an hour. I then called
him away, and instead of carrying him directly to my
castle at first, I conveyed him to my cave on the farther
part of the island; and so my dream was how fulfilled in
that particular, that my grove should prove an asylum or
sanctuary to him.
Weary and faint, hungry and thirsty, undoubtedly must
this poor creature be, supported chiefly by the vivacity of
spirit, and uncommon transports of joy that his deliverance
occasioned. Here I gave him bread and a bunch of raisins
to eat, ami water to drink, on which he fed very cheer-
fully, to his exceeding refreshment. I then made him a
convenient be^ with a parcel of rice straw, and a blanket
«j>on.it, (a bed which 1 used wyMf sometimes (and then
90 LD'E AND ABTEtfVIT* £#'
pointing to it* made signs for him to lie down to Jeep,
upon which the poo; creature went to take a welcome re-
pose.
Indeed he was a very comely, handsome, young fellow^
extremely well made, with straight loivg limbs, not too
large, but tall and well (leaped, and, as near as I couid
reckon, about twenty- six years oi age. His countenance
hid nothing in it fierce or surly, but rather a sort of majesty
in his s«ce; and yet, especially when he smiled, he had all
the sweetness and softness of an European. His hair was
rot curled like wool, as many of the blacks are, but long^
ard black, with the most beautiful, yet careless trest'es
spreading over his shoulders. Me Ind a very high and
large foiehead, with a great vivacity and sparkling iharp-
nefs in his eyes. His ikm was not so tavvney as the Virgi-
nians, Brazilians, or other Americans; but rather of a
bright dun, olive colour, that had something agreeable in
it, though t?ot very easy to give a description of. His face
was round and plump, with a small nose, very different
from the flatness of the negroes, a'pretty small mouth,
thin lips, fine teeth, very well set, and white as the driven
snow. In a word, such handsome features, and exact,
symmetry in every part, made me consider, that I had
saved the life of an Indian prince, no less graceful and ac-
complished-than the great Oroonoko, whose memorable
behaviour and unhappy contingencies of life have charmed
the world, both to admiration of his person, and compas-
sion to his sufferings.
But let him be either prince or peasant, all my happi-
ness centered in this, that 1 had now got a good servant or
companion, to whom, as he deserved, I was reiolved to prove
a ki.jd mailer and a lasting friend. He had not, I think*,
fiept above an hour, when he awakened again, and while I
was milking my goats hard by, out he runs from the cave
towards me in my inclosure, and laying himself do^n on the
ground* in iW lowest prostration, made ail the antic gestures
imaginable, to express his thankfulness tome for being hii
diliverer. I confess, though the manner of his behaviour
seemed to be ludicrous enough to occasion laughter; yet
1 was very much moved at his affection, so that my beaut
melted within me, fearing he might die away in excess o£
j&y, like reprieved malefactors; especially as I wasinea-:
pable eJCher to let him blood, or administer physic. It
iveie to be wifted, that Christians would take example bf

this; Heath ei&^fco haVe* testing remembrance of the bene-
fits^4xldiverarrctfr they J%$ve received*.by tlie kind raiv
diation and powerful interposition os their benefactors and.
deliverers; and jt would be. likewise happy for mankind,
were there no- occasion to blame many, who, instead of
thankfully acknowledging favours and benefits, rather abuse
and condemn those whcr have been the instruments to save
them from destruction.
But, leaving these just reflections, I return to the objtct
that.occasioned them; for my man, to conclude the last
ceremony of obedience, laid down hb head again on the
ground, close to my foct, and set my other foot upon his
head, as he had done before, making all the signs of sub-
jection, servitude, and submission imaginable, and let me
understand he would serve me as long as his life endured.
As I understood him in many things, 1 made him sensible
I was very well pleased with him; and, in a little time, I
began to speak to him, and learn him to talk to me
again. In the first place, 3 made him understand his name
was to be Friday, because it was upon that day I saved his
life; then I taught him to fay Master, which 1 made him
sensible was to be my name. I likewise taught him to say
Yes and No, and to know what they meant. I gave him
some milk in an earthtn pot, making him view me while
J drank it before him, and soked my bread in it; I gave
him a cake of bread, and caused him to soak it likewise,
to which he readily consented, making signs of the greatest
satisfaction imaginable.
All that night did I keep hime there; but no fe oner did
the morning light appear, when 1 ordered him to arise, and
come al ng with me, with certain tokens th.it 1 would,gve
him some clothes like mine, at which Le seemed very giad,
being stark naked, without the least, covering whatever.
As we passed by the place where the two men had been
interred, my man pointed directly to their graves, showing
me the marks that he had made to find them again, giving
me to understand, by signs, that we ihould dig them up,
and devour them. At this I appeared extremely displea-
sed, expressed my utmost abhorrence, as if 1 would vomit
at the apprehensions of it, btekoning with rny hand to
come^way, which he did with the gre&tdt reverence and-
submission. After this I conducted him to the top of the,
hist, toview if the rait of the savages were yet jemaining
there; but whsf*1 looked through my perspective glass, I
could see no appearance of them, nor of their canoes; so
that it was very evident they never minded their deceased
companions whom we had flair*; which if they had, they
would surely have searched for, or left one boat behind for
them to fellow, after they returned from their pursuit.
Curiosity, and a destre of satisfaction, animating me with
Courage to fee this scene of barbarity, I tooE my man Fri-
day with me, putting a sword into his hand. with the bow
and arrows at his back, which I perceived he could use
very dexterously, causing him to ezrry one gun for me, and
I two for my self; and thus equipped against all attacks,
a\vsy we marched directly to the place of their bloody en-
tertainment. But when I came there, I was struck with
the utmost horror at so dreads J a spectacle, whilst Friday
was no way concerned about it, being no doubt in his turn
one of these deveurers. Here lay several human bones,
trier" several pieces of mangled flesh, half eaten, mangled
and icorched, whilst streams of blood ran promiscuously as
waters from a fountain. As I was muling on this dread-
ful siglit, Friday took all the pains he could, by particular
(Tgns, to make me understand, that they had brought over
f6ur prisoners to feast upon, three of whom they had eaten
up, and that he was the f>arth, pointing to himself; that
there having been a bloody battle between them and hi*
great king, in the jost defence of whom he was taken pri-
soner, with many others; all of these were carried off to
different plates to be devoured by their conquerors; and
that it was his misfortune to be brought hitner %y these
wretches for the fame purpose.
After I was made sensible of these things, L caused Fri-
day to gather those horrid remains, and lay them together
upon a heap, which I ordered to be set on fire, and burnt
them to ashes: My man, however, still retained the nature
of a cannibal, having a hankering stomach after some of
the flesh; btit such an extreme abhorrence did I express at
the least 2ppearance of it, that he durst not but conceal it;
for I made him very sensible, that if he offered any such
thing, 1 would certainly shoot him.
Tf is being done, 1 carried my man with me to ray castle,
and gave him a pair of linen drawers, which I had taken
crafc of the poor gunner's chest before mentioned; and
which, with a little alteration, fitted him very well: m the
rfext place I made hirti a jerkin of goats-skin, such as my
slfcill. was able to manage, and indeed I tho^ht inyself thm
a tolerable .good tailor. I gave him also a cap which I
made of a hare's skin, very convenient and fashionable.
Thus being clothed tolerably well> my man was no less
proud of his habit, than I was at feeing him in it. Indeed
he went very.awkwardly at first, the drawers being too
heavy on his thighs, not used to bear any weight, and the
sleeves of the waistcoat galled his shoulders and the irsile
of his arms; butby a little easing where he complained
they hurt him, .and by using himself to them, at length ne
took to them very well.
My next concern was, where I should lodge him; and
that I might do.well by him, and yet be perfectly easy
myself, I erected a tent for him in the vacant place be-
tween my two fcrtincations, in the inside of the last, and
the outside of the first; and, as there was,an entrance or
door into my cave, I made a formal framed door-case,
and a dpor to open on the inside; I barred it up in the
night time, taking in my ladders too, so that, was my man
to prove treacherous, there cowid be no way to ceme at
me in the inside of my innermost wall, without making so
much noise in getting over, that it must needs.waken me;
for my first wall had now a complete rocs over it of long
poles, spreading over my tent, and leaning up to the side
of the mountain, which w?s again laid cross wit'i smaller
sacks instead of laths, and thatched over a great thickne.fi
uith the rice straw, which.was ?.s strong as reeds; and at
the hole of the place, left on purpose to go in or out by
the ladder, had placed a kind of trap door, uhich, if it
had been attempted en the outside, would not have opened
at all, but have fallen down, and made a grea! noise; and
as to my weapons, eveiy night I took them all to my bed
fide. t . ''.
But-there,was no occaficu for this,precaution; for surely
Beyer master had a more sinceie, faithful, and Joying ser-
vant, than Friday proved to me. Without passion, sullen ness,
or defign, perfectly obliging and engaging, his affections
were as much tied to.me,as these ..of a qhild to its parents;
and I-might venture to fay, he..would have sacrificed his
life for the saving mine, upon any occasion whatsoever.
And indeed the many testimonies he?gave me of this, /us-
iiciently convinced me that I.had no occasion to ufc these
precautions. And here I cqm\d not hut reflect with great
wonder, that however it hath pleased the Almighty mhis
jproyiclence, and in the govejnpaem cf the creation, to take
94 LIFE AND A't>Vtffo*fTuk'tS
from so great a part of the-world of his creatures,isle no- ->
blest uses to which their faculties, and the jSpvvers of their
fouls are adapted; yet that he has bestowed upoti them the
fame reason, affections, sentiments of kindness and obliga
ticn, passions of resentment, sincerity^ fidelity; and all the
capacities of doing and receiving good that he has given
us; and that when he is graciously pleased to offer them
occasions of exerting these, they are as ready, nay, more
ready, to apply them to the proper uses Tor which they
were bestowed, than we often are. These thoughts would
make me melancholy, especially when I considered how
mean a use we make of all these, even though we have
these powers enlightened by the Holy Spirit of God, and by
the knowledge of this world, as an addition to our under-
standing; and why it has pleased the heavenly Wisdom to
conceal the like saving knowledge from so many millions
of fouls, who would certainly make a much better use of it
than generally mankind do at this time. These reflections
wruld sometimes lead me so far, as to invade the sove-
reignty of Providence, and, as it were, arraign the jus-
tice of such an arbitrary disposition of things, that should
obscure that light from some, and reveal it to others, and
yet expect a 1U e duty from all. But I closed it up, check-
ing my thoughts with this conclusion; first, That we were
ignorant of that right and law by which those Ihould be
condemned; but as the Almighty was necessarily, and by
the nature of his essence, infinitely just and holy; so it
could not be otherwis:, but that if these creatures were all
destined to absence from himself, it was on account of sirt-
uing against that light, which, as the Scripture fays, was
a law to themselves, and bv such a rules as their consciences
wonld acknowledge to be just, though the £rst foundation
was not discovered to as. And, secondly. That itill as we
were the clay in the hand of the potter, no vessel could
thus fay to him, " Why hast thou fashioned me after this
"manner?"
\ had not been above two or three days returned to my
castle, but my chief design was, how I ihould bring Fri-
day eff from this horrid way of feeding; and to take from
him that inhuman reliih he by najurfc had been accustomed
to, I tKbught it my duty to let him taste other flesh, which
might the rather tempt him to the fame abhorrence I so
often expressed "against their acenrfed way <*f living.
Upon which, one morning I took him out with mt, with
^Intention to kill a kid out of the flock, and bring it
tiome, and dress it. As I was going, I perceived a (he-
goat lying down in the shade, and two )Oung kids fitting
by her. Immediately I catched hold of my man Friday,
and bidding him stand still, and not stir, I presented my
piece, and (hot one of the kids. My poor servant, who
had at a distance perceived me kill his adversary, and yet
did not know by what means, or how it was done, stood
trembling and surprised, and looked so amazed, that I
thought he would have sunk into the earth. He did not
see the kid I aimed at, or behold I had killed it, but rip-
ped up his waistcoat to fee if he was not wounded, thinking
my resolution was to kill him; for coming to me, he sell
on his knees, earnestly pronouncing many things which [
did not understand the meaning of; which at length I per-
ceived was, that I would not take away his life.
Indeed I was much concerned to fee him in that condi-
tion, where nature is upon the severest trial, when the im-
mediate hand of death is ready to put for ever a period to
this mortal life; and indeed so much compassion had I to
this creature, that it was with difficulty I refrained from
tears. But, however, as another fort of countenance was
necessary, and to convince him that Twould co him ro
harm, I took him smiling by the hand, then laughed at
him, and pointing to the kid which I had slain, made
signs to him to fetch it, which accordingly he did. No
less curious was he in viewing how the creature was killed,
than he had been before in beholding the Jndian; which,
while he was admiring at, I charged my gun again, and
presently perceived a great fowl like a hawk, perching
;Upon a tree within shot; and, therefore, to let Friday un-
derstand what I was going to do, I called him to me again,
-, pointing at the fowl, which I found to be a parrot. I
made him understand that I would shoot and kill that bird;
accordingly I fired, and bade him look, when immediately
he saw the parret fall down. Again he stood like one
amazed, notwithstanding all I had said to him: and the
more confounded he was, because he did not perceive me
put any thing into my gun, Undoubtedly a thing so ut-
terly strange, carrying death along with it, far or near,
either to man or, beast, must certainly create the greatest
astonisliment to one who. never bad heard sikh a thin^ in
his whole life j and really his amazement continued folong,
%hu ha$ I allowed it, be would have prostrated himsel£be«
fore me and my gun, with the greatest worship and adora-
tion. As for the gun in particular, he would not so much
as touch it for several days after, but would come and
communicate his thoughts to it, and talk to it, as if the
senseless piece had understood and answered him; all this
1 could perceive him do, when he thought my back was
turned, the chief intent of which was, to desire it not to
kill him, as 1 afterwards came to understand.
I never strove to prevent his admiration, nor hinder him
from those comical gestures he used on such occasions; but
when his astonishment was a little over, I made tokens ta
him to run and fetch the parrot that I had mot; which ac-
cordingly he did, staying some time longer than usual, by
reason the bird not being quite dead, had stuttered some
way further from the place where (he fell. In the mean
time, as he was looking for her, I took the advantage of
charging my gun again, that so I might be ready for any
other mark that offered; but nothing more occurred at
that time. So 1 brought home the kid, and the fame
evening tcok off the skin, and divided the carcase as well
as I could. Part of the flesti i stewed and boiled in a pot
I had for this purpose. And then spreading my table, I
sat down, giving my man some of it to eat, who was won-
derfully pleased, and seemed to like it very weii: bat what
was the most surprising to him was to fee me eat silt with
it: upon which he made me understand, that the salt was
very bad for me; when puttlr.g a little into his mouth, he
seemed to nauseate it in such a manner, as to spit and sput-
ter at it, and then washed his mouth with freih watsr:
but to show him hew contrary his opinion was to mine, I
put some meat into my mouth without salt, and feigned
to spit and sputter as much for the want of it, as he had
done at it; yet all this proved cf no.signification to Fri-
day; and it was a long while befere he could endure salt in
his meat or broth, and even then but a small quantity.
Thus having fed him sufficiently with boiled meat and
broth at that time, the next day I was resolved to feast
him with a roasted piece os the kid. And having no spit
to fasten it, nor jack to turn it, I made use of that com-
mon artifice which many of the common people os England
have, that is to set two poles upon each side of the sire,
and one cross on the top, hanging the meat thereon with
a string, and so turning round continually* roast it, in the
feme manner as we read bloody tyrants pf old ciuelly
roasted the hply martyrs, This practice caused great ad--
miration in my man Friday, being quite another way than
that to which the savages were accustomed. But when he
came to taste the sweetness and tenderness of the; flesh, he
expressed his entire satisfaction above a thousand different
ways., And as I could not but understand his meaning,
you may be fare I was as wonderfully pleased, especially
when he made it also very plain to me, -that he would ne-
ver, while he lived, eat man's flesh more.
It was now high time I mould set ray servant to work;
so next day I set him to beat out some corn, and fist it in
the same manner as I had done before. And really the
fellow was very quick and handy in the execution of any
thing I ordered him to go about. I made him understand
that it was to make bread for us to ear, and afterwards let
him fee me make it. Jn ihort, he did every thing as I or-
dered him, and in a little time as well as I could perform
it myself.
But now considering that I had two mouths to feed in-
., stead of one, it was necessary that I must provide more
ground for my harvest, and plant a largerquantity of com
than I commpnly used to do; upon which 1 marked out a
larger piece of land, fencing it in, in the same manner as
1 had done before; in the execution of which I must give
Friday this good word, that no man could work more
hardy, or with Jbetter will than he did; and when I made
him iensible that it was for bread to serve him as well as
me, he then very passionately made me understand, that
he thought I had much more labour on his accounts than I
had &r myself; and that no pains or diligence should be
wanting in him, if I would but direct him in those works
wherein he might proceed.
I'must certainly own, that this was the .roost pleasant year
:I ever had in the island; for after some time, Friday be-
gan to talk pretty well, and understood the names of those
things which,! was wont to call for, and the places where
I used to send him. So that my long silent tongue, which
bad been useless so many years, except hi an exclamatory
, minner, eitlner for deliverance or blessings, now began to
be occupied in teaching, and talking to my man Friday;
for indeed" I had such a singular satisfaction in the fellow
himself, so innocent did his simple and unfeigned honesty
appear more and more to me every day, that I really be-
gan entirety t6 love him ; and for his part, I believe there
E
was no lore lost, and that his nature bad been more charmed
by his exceeding kindness, and his air>£rions;more" placed
upon me, than any other object whatsoever among his own
countrymen. I once had a great mind to try if he had
any hankering inclination to his own Conntry again \ and
by this time having learned the English so Well, that he
cold give me tolerable answers to any question which I
demanded. I asked him whether that nation to which he
belonged, ever conquered in battle? This question made
Friday to smile, and to which he answered, *« Yes, yes, we
*' always fight the better;" as much as to fay, they always
got the better in fight. Upon which we proceeded on the
following discourse: You say, said I, that you always fight
the better; why, then, Friday, how came you to be taken
prisoner?
Friday. But for all that my nation beat much.
Master* How say you, beat? if your nation beat them,
how came you to be taken?
Friday. They more many mans than my nation in the
place where me was; they take one, two, three, and me:
my nation much over beat them in the yonder place where
me no was, there my nation mans beat one, two, three
great tousand.
Master. Then why did not your men recover you from
the hands of your enemies?
Friday* They run one, two, or three, and me; they
make all go in the canoe; my nation hav e no canoe that
time.
Master* 'Tis very well, Friday; but what does your na-
tion do with the prisoners they take? Do they carry fcheiri
away and eat them as these have done ?-
Friday* Yes, yes, my nation eat mans too, eat up all.
Master* To what .place do they carry them to be de-
voured?
Friday. Go to other nations where they think.
Master* Do they bring them hither?
Friday. Yes, come over hither, come over other place.
Master. And have you been with them here, Friday?
Friday. Yes, me been here, (painting to .the north-west of
the island, being the side where they u^ed to land.)
Thus having gotten what account I could from my man,
I plainly understood, that he had been as bad as any of the
rest of the cannibals, having been formerly among the sa-
vages who used to come on shore on the farthest part of the
5flaad^.,upon jthe/ame bloody occasion as he was brought
huher: for \ and some time after I xarrisd him to that place
where .he pointed,; and nosooner did he come there, bit
he presently knew the ground, signifying to me that he wa*
oqce there when they ate up twenty men, two women, and
a young child; but as he could not explain the number ia
English* he .did it by so many stones in a row, making a siga
to .me to count them.
""This passage I have the rather mentioned, because it le&
to things more important and useful for me to know; for
aster 1 had this satisfactory discourse with him, my next
: question was, how far it was from theiiland to the shore,
and whether the canoes were not often lost in the ocean?
to which he answered, there was no danger; that no canoes
were ever lost; but that after a Jittle way out to the sea,
there was a strong current, and a wind always one way in
the afternoon. ,This I thought at first to be no more than
the sets of the tide, of going out or coming in; but I af-
terwards understood it uas occasioned by the great draught
and reflux of the mighty river Oroonoko, in the mouth
.or gulph of which I imagined rny kingdom lay; and that
the land which I perceived to the W. and N.*W. must be
the great island Trinidad, on the north of the river. A
thousand questions (if that would satisfy me) did 1 ask Fri-
day, about the nature of the country, the &a, the coasts,
the inhabitants, and Avhat nations were nearest them; to
which questions the poor fellow declared all he knew, with
the greatest openness, and utmost sincerity. When I de-
manded of him.the particular names of the various nations
of his fort of people, he could only answer me in genera],
that they were called Ca ralee. Hence ii was I considered
that these must be the Carribbees, so much taken noiice of
by.our maps, to be en that part of America, which reaches
from the mouth of the river Oroonoko to Guianio, and so
en to St. Martha. Then Friday proceeded to tell me, that
up a great way beyond.the moen, as much as to fay, be-
yond the setting of the moor, which must be W. from their
country, there dwelt white bearded men, such as I was,
pointing to my whiskers, and that they kill much mans. I
was not ignorant\vith what barbarity the Spaniards tr^ed
thde creatures; so that I presently concluded it must be
them, wnose.crueltie-s had spread throughout America, to
;|>e;reaiembcred even to succeeding generations.
Well, you may be sure, this knowledge, which the im-
perfect knowledge of my man had led me to, was very
comfortable to me, and made me so curious as to ask him
Jiow I might depart from this island, and get amongst ihbse
white men? He told me, " Yes, yes, I might go in two
"canoes." In two canoes, thought I, what does my man
mean? surely he means one for himself, and another for
me; and if not, how must two canoes hold me without
being joined, or one part of my body being put in one,
and another in another? And indeed it was a long time
before 1 understood his meaning, whrch was, that it must
be a large boat, as big as two canoes, able to bear with the
waves, and not so liable to be overwhelmed as a small one
must be.
I believe there is not state of life but what may be happy,
if people would but erideavour for their part to make it so.
He is not the happiest man that has the most riches; but
he that is content with what he hath. Before I had my
servant, I thought myself miserable til! I had him; and
now that I.had enjoyed the luppy benefits rf him, I still
Complained, and begged a deliverance from a place of-re-
tirement, ease, and plenty, where Providence had suffici-
ently blessed me. In a word, from this time I entertained
some hopes, that one time or other I might find an oppor-
tunity to make my escape from this island, and that this
poor savage might be a great furtherance thereto.
All the t'me since my man became so intelligent as to
understand and speak to me, 1 spared no pains nor dili-
gence to instruct him, according to my poor mare of know-
ledge in the^principles of religion, and the adoration that
he ought to pay to the True God. One time, as I very
well remember, I asked him who made him? At first the
innocent creature did not understand what I meant, but
.rather thought I asked him who was his father? upon v/hich
I took another way to make him sensible, by demanding
from him an answer to this question. Friday, said I, who
is it that made the sea, this ground whereon we walk, and
all these hills and woods which we behold? And here, in-
deed, I did not miss my intention; for he told me it was
Old Benamuckee (the God whom I supposed these savages
adored) who lived a great way beyond all. But as to his
attributes, poor Friday was an utter stranger. He could
describe nothing of this great person; and all that he could
say was, that he was very old, much older than the sea and
land, the moon, or the stars. Friday, said I again, is this
great and old person has made all things in the world, how
comes it to pass, that all things, as you in particular, do not
adore and worship him? upon this looking very grave, with
a perfect sweet lock of innocence, he replied, " Mailer, all
"things fay O to him/I by which it may reasonably be
supposed he meant adoration. And where, said t, do the
people os your country go when they die? He answered to
Binaniiicka* What, and those people that are eaten up, do
they go there? (i Benamuckee," said he, " love 'em dearly;
"me pray to Le>.-amutket in de canoe, and Benamuckes
"would love me when dey eat me all up."
Such discourses as these had I with my man, and such
made me sensible, that the true God is worshipped, tho'
under imperfect: similitudes; and that the seise adoration
which the Heathens give to their imaginary Deity, is as
great an argument of the divine essence, as the moil learn-
ed Atheists (faljlyjo calid) can bring against it; for God
will be glorified in his works, let their denomination be what
it will; and I cannot be of that opinion which some con-
ceive, that God mould decree men to be damned for want
of a right notion of faith, in a place where the wisdom of
the Almighty has not-permitted it to be preached; and
therefore cannot but conclude, that since obedience is the
best sacrifice, these poor creatures, acting by that light and
knowledge which they are possessed of, may undoubtedly
obtain a happy salvation, though not that enjoyment witfi
Christ, as his saints, anfessors, and martyrs must enjoy.
But laying these determinations aside, more sit for di-
vines than me to discuss, I began to instruct my servant ia
the saving knowledge of the true Deity, in which the di-
rections of God's Holy Spirit assisted me. I listed up my
hands to Heaven, and pointing thereto, told him, that the
great Maker of Heaven and Earth lived there; that as
his infinite power fashioned this world out of a confused
chaos, and made it in that beautiful frame which we be-
hold, so he governs and preserves it by his unbounded
knowledge, sovereign greatness, and peculiar providence;
that he was omnipotent, could do every thing for us, give
every thing to u?, and take every thing away.from us;
that he was a rewarder and puniiher of good and evil
actions; that there was nothing but what he knev, no
thoughts so secret but what he could bring to light; aud
the^hv degrees, I opened his eyes, and described to him
the manner of the creation of the world, the situation of
paradise, the transgression of our first parents^ the wicked-
ness of God's peculiar people, and the universal sins and
abominations of the whole earth* When these things were
impknted in his mind, I told him, that as God's justice
was equal to his mercy, he resolved to destroy this world,
till his.Son Jesus Chr'st interposed in our behalf; and, to
procure our redcropiion, obtained leave of his heavenly
Father to cerre down from Heaven into the world, where
he took human nature upon him, injstructed us in our way
to eternal life, and died as a sacrifice for our sins y that he
was now ascended into Heaven, mediating for our pardon,,,
delivering our petitions, and obtaining all those good be-
nefis which we ask in his name, by hu-nble and hearty
prayers, all which were heard at the throne of Heaven.
As very frequently I used to inculcate"things into his mind,
Friday one day told me, that if our great God could hear
us beyond the fun, he must surely be a greater God than
their Bexamuckee, who lived but a little way ofrY and yet
could no: hear them till they ascended the great mountains
where he dwelt, to speak to him. What, said I, Friday,
did you go thither to speak to him too? He answered,
*' No, they never went that were young men, none but
€f old men, called their Oswa.kaAee," meaning the Indian
priests, *' who went to fay O, (so he called saying their
prayer*) "and they returned back, and told them what
*' Ber.amuckee said." From hence, I could not but ob-
serve how happy we Christians are, who have God's im-
mediate revelation for ourcertaic guide; and that our faith
is neither misted, nor our reason imposed upon, by any set
of men, such as these Indian impostors.
But, to clear up this palpable cheat to my man Friday,
I told him, that the pretence of their ancient men going up
to the mountain to fay O to their God Benamuckte, was an
imposture, and that their bringing back an answer was all
a sham, if not worse; for that, if there was any such thing
spoken to them, surely it must proceed from an infernal
spirit. And here I thought it necessary to enter intd a
long discourse with him, which I did after this manned.
Friday, said J, you must know, that before thi/world
was made, there was an Almighty power existing, by whose
power all things were made, and whose Majesty stiall-have
no end. To be glorified and adored by beings of a hea-
venly nature, he created angels and archangels, that rs
glorified spirits resembling himself, to encompass his throne*
eternally sinking forth his praise in the most heavenly sounds
and divine harmony. And, among this heavenly choir,
Lucifer bore a great sway, as being then cne of the pecu-
liar favourites of these celestial abodes; but he, contrary to
that duty he owed his heavenly Sovereign, with unbounded
ingratitude to his Divine Creator, not only envied him that
adoration which was his due, but thought to usurp that
throne, which he had neither power to keep, nor tide to
pretend to. He raised a dissention and civil war in Heaven,
and had a number of angels to take his part. Unbound-
ed folly! stupendous pride! to hope for victory, and
aspire above his powerful Creator! The Deity, not fearful
of such an enemy, yet justly provoked at this rebellion, com-
mInched his archangeic Michael to lead forth the heavecly
host, and give him battle; the advantage of which was
quickly perceived, by Satan's being overthrown, and the
prince of the air, fer so the devil called, with all his
fallen angels, driven headlong into a dismal place, which
is called HtlL
The recital of this truth made my man give the greatest
attention, and he expressed a great satisfaction by his
gestures, that God had sent the devil into the deep hole.
And then I desired him to give great heed to what I had
further to say.
No sooner, proceeded I, was God freed from, and the
Heaven clear of this arch-traitor, but the Father speaks to
the Son and Holy Spirit, who belonged to his essence, and
were equal to him in power and glory, Com? lei us make man,
said he in cur ozvn ima^e, after our onxn Ilk nep, Gen. i. 26.
to have dominion over the creatures of the world which we
have created. And these he intended should glorify him
in Heaven, according to their obedience in this state of
probation on earth, which was, as it were, to be the school
to train them up for these heavenly mansions. Now, Satan
seeing himself soiled; yet that Gcd had taken the pouer
frcm him as prince of the air, which power Heaven design-
ed he should retain, whereby his creatures might be tried; in
revenge for the disgrace he had received, he tempts Adam's
wife, Eve, to taste of the tree of knowledge of good and
evil, which God had forbidden. He appears, to her in the
shape of a serpent, then a most beautiful creature, and tells
her that it was no better than an imposition, which God
had put upon her and her hulband, not to eat of that fa'*r
E4
fruit which he had created; that the taste thereof would
make them immortal like God himself; and consequently
as great and powerful as he. Upon which she not only eat
thereof herself, hut made her husband eat also, which
brought them both under the heavenly displeasure.
Here Friday expressed a great concern: *' Ah, poor
€i mans!" cried he, '* naughty womans! naughty devil I
*c make God not love de mans, make mans like devil
» himself/'
Friday, said I, God still loved mankind, and though the
devil tempted human nature so far, he would not suffer him
to have an absolute power over them. I have told you be-
fore of his tender love to his people, till they, like Lucifer,
disobeyed his commands and rebelled against him; and
even then, how Jesus Christ, his only Son, come to save
sinners. But still every man that lives in the world is un-
der temptation and trial. The devil has yet a power, as
prince of the air, to suggest evil cogitations in our minds,
and prompt us on to wicked actions, that he might glory
in our destruction. Whatever evil thoughts we have, pro-
ceed from him; so that God, in this our distress, expects
we should apply ourselves to him by fervent prayer for
speedy redress. He is not like R:ncmucke>, to let none
come near him but 0)uakah(t but suffers the people as
well as priests to offer themselves at his feet, thereby to be
delivered from the power and temptation of the devil.
Eut though at first my man Friday expressed some con
cern at the wickedness of Lucifer, 1 found it not so easy to
imprint the right notions of him in his mind, as it was about
the divine essence of God ; for there nature assisted me in
all my arguments, to mow to him plainly the necessity of a
great first cause, and over-ruling, governing power, of a
secret directing Providence, and of the equity and reason-
ableness of paying adoration to our Creator; whereas there
appeared nothing of all this in the notion of an evil spirit,
of his first beginning, his nature, and, above all, of his
inclination to evil actions, and his power to tempt us to the
like. And indeed this unlearned Ir.dian, by the mere force
of nature, puzzled me with one particular question, more
than ever I could have expected.
I had, it seems, one day, been talking to him of the
omnipotent power of God, and his infinite abhorrence of
sm, insomuch that the Scriptures styled him a consuming firs
to all the workers of iniquity ; and that it was in his power,
whenever lie pleased, to destroy all the world in a moment,
the greater part of which are continually offending him,
When, with a serious attention, he had listened a great
while to what I said, after I had been telling him how the
devil was God's enemy in the hearts of men, and used all
his malice and skill to defeat the good designs of Provi-
dence, and destroy the kingdom of Christ in the world,
and so forth : «* Very well, Master," said Friday, " you say
"God is so strong, so great, is he not much strong, much
"mightier than tiie naughty devil?" To be sure, Friday,
said I, God is more wife and stronger than the serpent:
he is above the devil, which makes us pray to him, that
he would tread down Satan under his feet, enable us to
resist the violent temptations, and quench his fiery darts.
"Why then," answered Friday quickly, '* if God, as you
«f fay, has much strong, much might as the devil, why God
*' no kill devil, make no more tempt, no more do wicked."
You may be certain, I was strangely surprised at this
question of my man's: and, though an old man, I was but
a young doctor, and consequently very ill qualified for a
causuist,or a resolver of intricate doubts in religion, and, as
it required some time for me to study for an answer, I pre-
tended not to hear him, nor to ask him what he said; but,
so earnest was he for an answer, as not to forget his question,
which he repeated in the very fame broken words as above.
When I had recovered myself a little, Friday, said I,
God will at last punisti him severely, being reserved for
judgment, and is to be cast into the bottomless pit, to re-
main in fire everlasting. But all this did not satisfy Friday;
for, returning upon me, he repeated my words, " reserve
*' at last, me no understand; but, why not kill dtvil
"now, not kill devil, great, great while ago r"' Friday,
said I, you may as well ask me why God does not kill you
and me, when, by our wicked actions, we so much ofFen4
his divine Majesty I He gives us time to repent of our fins,
that thereby we may obtain pardon. At these words obtain
fardw, Friday mused a great while; and, at last, looking
me stedfastly in the face, "Well, well," said he, «« that's
"very well; so you, I, devil, all wicked mans, all preserve,
"repent, God pardon all."'
Indeed, here I was run down to the last extremity, when
it became very evident to me, how mere natural notions
will guide reasonable creatures cb the knowledge of. a
Deity, and to the homage due to the Supreme Being ot*
E5
God; but, however, nothing bat divine revelation can form
the knowledge of Jesus Christ, and of a redemption pur-
chased for us, os the mediator os the new covenant, and of
an intercess r at the footstool of God's throne ;-and, there-
fore, the Gospel of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ;
that is, the word and Spirit of God, promised for the guide
nnd sanctisierof his people, are the most necessary instruc-
tors of the fouls of men, in the saving knowledge of the
Almighty, and the means to attain eternal happiness.
And new I found it necessary to put an end to this dis-
course between my man and me; for which purpose I rose
up hastily, and made as if I had some occasion to go our,
fending Friday for something that was a good way off. I
then fell on my knees, and befeeched God that he would
inspire me so far as to guide this poor savage in the know-
ledge of Christ, to answer his questions more clearly, that
i-;s conscience might be convinced, his eyes opened, and
his foul saved. When he returned again, I entered into
a very long discouise with him, upon the subject of the
wrrld's redemption by the Saviour os it, and the doctrine
of repentance preached from Heaven, together with an
holy faith of our blessed Redeemer Jesus Christ; and then
I proceeded to explain to him, according to my weak ca-
pacity, the reason why our Saviour.took not on him the
nature of angels, but rather the feed of Abraham ; and how
the fallen angels had no benefit by that redemption; and,
lastly, that he came only to the lost sheep of the house of
Israel, and the like. God knows I had more sincerity than
knowledge in all the ways I took for the poor Indian's in-
struction; and, I must acknowledge what [ believe, every
body that acts upon the fame principle will find, that in
lading heavenly truths open befere him, 1 informed and
instructed myself in many things that either I did not know,
or had not perfectly considered before; so that, however,
this poor creature might be improved by my instructions,
certain it is, that I myself had great reason to be thankful
to Providence for send ng him to me, His company al-
layed roy grief, and made my habitation comfortable; and
when I reflected that the solitary life to which 1 had been
so long confined, had made me to look further* towards
Heaven, by making me the instrument under Providence,
to save the life, and,£|pr ought J know, the soul of this
poor savage, by bring-ng him to the knowledge of Jesus
Christ, it caused a secret joy to spread through every part
©f my soul; and I frequently rejoiced, that ever I was
brought to this place, which I once thought the most mi-
serable part of the world.
in this thankful frame of mind did I afterwards conti-
nue, while I abode on the island, and for three years did
my man and. I live in the greatest enjoyment of happiness.
.Indeed, 1 believe the savage was as good a Christian as];
and I hope we were equally penitent; and such penitents
as were comforted and restored by God's Holy Spirit; for
now we had the word of the Lord to instruct us in the right
way, as much as if we had been on the Englisti (bore
By the constant application 1 made to the Scriptures, as
I read them to my man Friday, I earnestly endeavoured to
make him understand every part of it, as much as lay in
my power He also, on the other hand, by his very serious
<|: eft ions and inquiries, made me a much better proficient
in Scripture knowledge, than i ssould have been by my
own private reading and study. I must not omit another
thing, proceeding from the experience I had in my retire-
ment: ft was that infinite and inexpressible Welling., the
knowledge of God through Jesus Christ, which was io
plain and easy to be understood, as immediately to direct
me to carry on the great work of sincere repentance for
my sins, and laying hold of a Saviour for eternal life, to
a practical stated reformation, and obedience to all God's
institutions, without the assistance of a reverend and ortho-
dox divine; and especially by this fame instruction*, so to
enlighten this savage creature, as to make him f> good a
Christian, as very few could exceed him. And there was
only this great thing wanting, that 1 had no authority to
administer the Holy Sacrament, that heavenly participation
of ChiiiTs body and blood; yet, however, we rested our-
selves content, that God would accept our desires, and ac-
cording to our faith, have mercy on us.
But what we wanted one way, was made up in another,
and that was universal peace in our little-church. We had
no disputes and wranglings about the mature and equality
of the holy, blessed, and undivided Trnuy; no niceties i.\
doctrine, or schemes of church -government;, no four or
morose dissenters to impose more sublimated notions upon
us; no pedantfophisters to confound us with unintelligible
mysteries: but, instead of all this, we enjoyed the molt
certain guide to Heaven ; that is, the word of God; be.
.--.-. E6
sides which, we had the comfortable views of his Spirit
leading us to the truth, and making us both willing and
cbed\ent to the instruction of his word. As the knowledge
and practice of this are the principal means of salvation*
I cannot fee what it avails any Christian church, or man.
.in the world, to amuse himself with speculations and opi-
nions, except it be to display their particular vanity and
affectation.
You may well suppose, that, by the frequent discourse
we had together, my man and I became mest intimately
acquainted, and that there was but very little that I could
fay, but what Friday understood; and, indeed, he spoke
very fluently, though it was but broken English. 1 now
tock 2 particular pleasure in relating all my adventures,
especially those that occurred since my being cast on this
island. I made him understand that wonderful mystery,
as he conceived, of gunpowder and bullet, and taught him
how to (hoot. I also presented to him a knife, which pleased
him exceedingly, making him a belt, with a frog hanging
thereto, like those in which we wear hangers in England j
and, instead of a hanger to put in the frog, I gave him a
hatchet, which was not only as good, but even a better
weapon upon many occasions, in a word, my man thus
accoutred, looked upon himself as great as Don Quixote,
when that celebrated champion went to combat the wind-
mill.
I next gave him a very particular description of the ter-
ritories of Europe, and in a particular manner of Old En-
gland, the place of my nativity. I laid before him the
manner of our worshipping God, our behaviour one to
another, and how we trade in ships to every part of the
universe. I then told him my misfortunes in being mip-
wrecked, showing him, as near as I could, the place where
the ihip lay, which had been gone long before; but I
brought him to the ruins of my boat, which before my
whole strength could not move, but now was almost rotten,
and fallen to pieces. I observed my man Friday to view
this boat with an uncommon curiosity; which, when he
had done, he stood pondering a great while, and said no-
thing. At last, said I, Friday, what makes you ponder
so much? He replied, «* O master, me see like7boat come
"to place at my nation."
It was some time, indeed, before I understood what my
man meant; but examining strictly into it, I plainlyIfoand,
that feh another boat resembling mine, had ccme upoa
the country where he dwelt; that is to fay, by his farther
explanation, that the boat was driven there through stress
of weather. It then came into my mind that some Ea-
ropean ship having been cad a*vay, the poor distressed,
creatures were forced to have recourse t,o the boat to save
their lives; and being all, as I thought, drowned, I never
concerned myself to ask any thing concerning them, but
my only inquiry was abcut the boat, and what descripiioa
my man could give of it.
Indeed Friday answered my demands very well., making
every thing very plain to my understanding; but beyond
measure was I satisfied, when he told me with great warmth
and ardour, " O master, we save white mans from drown;"
upon which I immediately asked him, if there were any
white mans, as he called them, in the boat ? (t Yes, yes/'
said he, " the boat full, very full of while mans." How
many, Friday? said I. Hereupon he numbered his fin-
gers, and counted seventeen. And when 1 asked him what
became of them all, and whether they lived or not? ho
replied, «' Yes, master, they all live, they be live among
my nation." This information put frefn thoughts into
my head, that these must be those very men who before I
concluded had been swallowed up in the ocean, after they
had left the ship, that had struck upon the rocks of ray
kingdom, and after escaping the fury of the deep, landed
upon the wild more, and committed themselves to the fury
of the devouring Indians.
The manner of their cruelties to one another, which
consequently, as I thought, must be acted with greater
barbarity to strangers, created in me a great anxiety, and
made me still more curious to ask Friday concerning them.
He told me,he was sure they still lived there, having resided
amorg them above four years, and that the savages gave
them victuals to live upon: But pray, Friday, said I,
whence proceeded all this good nature and generosity r*
How came it to pass that they did not kill and eat them,
to. please their devouring appetitites, and occasion so
splendid an entertainment among them ?" No, no," said.
Friday," they not kill 'em, they make brothers with 'em;'*
by which I understood there was a truce between them.
And then I had a more favourable opinion of the Indians,
upon Friday uttering these words: "My nation, t'other
€i nation no eat mar:s, but when mans make war fight;"
as though he fa-dl said, that neither those of his kingdom,
nor any other nations that he knew of, ever ate their fel-
low-creatures, but such as their law of arms allowed to be
devoured; that is, those miserable captives whose misfor-
tune it should be to be made prisoners of war.
Some considerable time after, upon a verv pleasant day,
in most serene leather, my man and I stood upon the top
of ,*\ h 11, on the cast side of the i4hnd, whence shad once
before beheld the continent of America. 1 co^ld not tell
immediately what was the matter; for suddenly Friday
fell a jumping and dancing ?.s if he had been mad; and
upon my demanding the reason of his behaviour,«« Qjoy!"
said he, " O glad! there fee my country, there my nation,
"there live white mans ge.her.*' And indeed such a rap-
turous fense cf pleasure appeared in his countenance, that
his ees had an uncommon sparkling and brightness, and
such a strange eagerness, as if he had a longing derlre to
be in his coumry again- This made me not so* well
satisfied with rny man Friday as before; for by this ap-
pearance,! made no dispute, bm that it he could get back
thither again, he would not only be ur mindful of' what
religion I had taught him, but likewise of the great obli-
gation he owed me For his wonderful delivers.«ce; nay,
that he we uld not only inform his countrymen of me, but
accompany hundreds of them to my kingdom, and make
me a miserable sacrifice like those unhappy wretches token
in battle.
Indeed I wss very much to blame to have thefe cruet
and urjufi suspicions, and must freely own I wrOnged the-
poor creature very much, who was ci a quite contrary
temper And had he ha<l that discerning acuteness whkh-
many Euiopeans have, he would certainly have perceived
my co'dnefs and indifference, and also have been very
much concerned upon that account: as I was now mor>e
circumspect, I had much lessened my kindness and fami-
liarity with him, and while this jealousy continued, I used
that artful way (now too much in fashion, the occasion of
ftriie and d ssertion) of pumping him daily thereby to dis-
cover whether he was deceitful in his thoughts and incli-
nations , but certainly-he had nothing in him but what wfis
•consistent with the best principles, both as a religious Christ-
ian and a-grateful, friend; and, indeed, 1 found every
thing ht (aid w*s ingenuous and innocent, that I had no
room for suspicion, and, in spite of ail uneasiness, he not
3
only made me entirely his own again, but also caused me
much to lament that I ever conceived one ill thought of
him.
As we were walking up the same hill another day, when
the weather was so hazy at sea, that i could not perceive
the continent, Friday, said I, don't you wish yourself to be
in ycur own country, your nation, among your old friends
and acquaintances ? <c Yes/' said he, " me much O glad to
** be at my own nation-" And what you would do there,
Friday? Would you turn wild again, eat man's stem, and
fee a savage as you were formerly? ** No, no," (answered
he, full of concern, and shaking his head) u Friday now
"tell them to live good, tell them pray God, tell them
*c to eat corn bread, cattle flesh, milk, no eat man again."
, But surely, replied I, if you should offer to do all this, they
will kill you; and to manifest their contempt of such in-
struction eat you up when they have done. He then put
on a grave, yet innocent and smooth countenance, saying,
"No, they no kill me, they willing love learn:" that is,
.that they would be very willing to learn: adding witha1,
*' that they had learned much of the bearded mars that
"came in the boat." Will you, said I, go back again,
Friday? He smiled at that, and told mt, that he cculd
not swim so far. But said I, I will make a canoe for
you. <( Yes, mailer," said, he, ** me go if you go, me no
*' go if you stay." I go, Friday! why would you have
them to eat me up, and^devour your kind master r "No
*' no, said he, " me make them not eat master, and me
** makethem much love you ;" that is, he would tell them
how I had ilain his enemies, and thereby saved his life, for
which reason he would make them love me: and then he
related to me, as well as he was able, how exceedingly kind
those of his nation were to the white, or bearded men, as
he called them, who, in their great calamity, were driven
into their country. ,
It was from this time, indeed, I had strong inclinations
to venture over, and use my utmost efforts, if possible, to
join these white bearded men, who undoubtedly were Spa-
niards, or Portuguese; for, thought J, it must be certainly
a better and safer way to escape when there is a good com-
pany, than for me alone, from an island forty miles off the
Ihore, and without any assistance. Some days, after, Fri-
day and I being at work, as usual, at the fame time di-
verting ourselves with various discourses, I told him I had
a boat which I would bestow upon him, whenever he pleased
to return to his own nation; and to convince him cf the
truth of what I said, I took him with me to the other fide
of the island, where my frigate lay, and then taking it
from under the water, (for I always kept it funk for fear
of a discovery) we went both into it to fee how it would
manage such an expedition.
And really never could any be more dexterous in rowing
, than my faithful servant, making the boat go as fast again
as I could. Well row, Friday, said I, shall we now go
to your so much admired nation? But instead of meeting
with that cheerfulness I expected, he looked very dull and
melancholy at my saying so; which indeed at first fur-
prised me, till he made me sensible, that his concern was
about the boat's being too small to go so far a voyage.
Upon which I let him understand I had a much bigger;
and, accordingly, the next day went to the place where
the first boat lay, which I had made, when all the strength
I had or art I could use failed me in my attempt to get
it into the water: but now it having lain in the fun two
and twenty years, and no care being taken of it all that
while, it became in a manner rotten. My man told me,
that such a boat would do very well for the purpose, suf-
ficient to carry enough <vittle, drink, bread, for that was his
manner of talking. In short, my mind being strongly
fixed upon my design of going over with him to the Con-
tinent, I very plainly told him, that we wauld both go and
make a boat full as big, and more proportionable than that,
wherein he might safely return to his own nation.
These words made Friday look so very pensive, that I
thought he would have fallen at my feet. It was some time
before he could speak a word, which made me a(k him,
what was the matter with him? He replied in a very soft
and moving tone, (< What has poor Friday done? why are
*' you angry mad with poor servant? What me done, O
"what me done?" Friday, said I, you never yet have
offended me, what makes you think I am angry with
you, when I am not angry at all. "You no angry, no*
"angry," said he,, several times; "if you be no angry,
*' why den fend Friday over great water to my own na-
"tion ?" Why, surely, Friday, answered I, did not you wish .
to be there, when from a mountain you beheld the place
where he was born.? and is it not to satisfy your desires
that I am willing to give you leave to return thither?
i€ Yes, yes/' said Friday," mewishtobethere sure enough,
"but then me wish Friday there too : no wish Friday there,
€t no master there." In short, he could not endure the
thoughts of going there without me. I go there I Friday,
said 1, what shall I do there r He answered very quickly,
'* Q master, you do great deal much good, you teach all
*' de wild mans to be good tame mans: you learn dem to
"be sober, life good live, to know God, and pray God.*'
Alas! poor Friday, said I, what can i do against their
priests of Benamuckee, cr indeed what good can I make
your nation sensible of, when I myself am but a poor ig-
norant man?" No, no, master," said he, " you be noi|-
"norant, you teachee me good, you teachee dem good.'*
You shall go without me, Friday, said I, for I don't care
to acccmpany you thither; i would rather live in this soli-
tude than venture among such inhuman savages. Go your
way, since you desire it, and leave me alone by mvfelf, as
I was before 1 saved your life.
Never was any creature more thunderstruck than Friday
was at these words. "Go me away, leave master away,"
said he, aster a long silence, u no, no, Friday die, Friday
"live net master gone," as though he had laid, i neither
can nor will live, if my master fends me from him. And
here I cannot but take notice of the strong ties of friend-
ship, which many times surpass those of consanguinity : For
often we sind a great disagreement air.or.g kindred; and
when there is any seeming regard for each other, it is very
seldom tiue, and scarce ever lasting, if powerful interest
dees not bear the sway; and that alone is often the occa-
sion of the greatest hatrtd in the ucrld, which is to desire
the death of parents and relations, for the fake of acquir-
ing their fortunes. But there was no such thing between
my servant and me; instead of which there was the greatest
gratitude and the most sincere love; he found me net only
his deliverer, but his preserver and comforter; not a severe
and cruel tyrant, but a kind, loving, and affable friend.
He wanted for no manner of sustenance; ard when he was
-ill or out of order, J was his physician, not only for hia
body but his foul; and therefore r.o wonder was it, that
such an innocent creatuie?long since divested of his former
natural cruelty, mould have an uncommon conarnatso
cruel a separation from me, which pit reed him to the very
soul, and made him desire even to die, r.ather than live
withe ut me.
114 *t¥E AND AD7UNTtRry
After I had told Friday,in a very caraless manner, that
he (hould be at his liberty as soon is the boat was made,
the language of his eyes expressed all imaginable confusion;
when, immediately running to one of his hatchets, which
he used to wear as a defensive weapon, he gives it into
my hand, with a heart fo fell, that he could scarcely speak.
Friday, said J, what is it you mean? What must I do with
this ?" Only, kill Friday," said he, "Friday cafe not live
««long." But what must I kill fern for? replied I again
4( Ah 1 dear master, what made you Friday save liroifc eat
*' a me up, so keep long Friday, make Friday love God,
** and love not Benamuckee, and n^w Friday send away;
€t never see Friday more." As though the poor creators
had said, Ala*! my dearest kind master, how comes it' to
pass, that after having ventured your precious lifeto save
me from the jaws of devouring cannibals, like myself, aster
such a tender regard to provide for me such a comfortable
nourishment, and contir/uing so long a kind master, and a
mot! sincere friend; and aster making me forsake the false
notion of an Indian deity, and worship the true God in.
spirit and in truth; and afeer all th:s, how comes it now,
that you are willirg to send me away to my former course
of living, by which means undoubtedly we ihall be dead to
each other; but greater must; be my misfortune, that I (hall
never bthold my best friend i have in the wcrld any more*
And this undoubtedly, though- he could not express him-
self so clearly, must be his sentiments; for the tears ran
down his cheeks in such a plentiful manner, that I had
much ado to refrain from weeping also, when I beheld the
poor creature's affection ;, so that I was forced to comfort
him in the best: manner I could, which I did, by telling
him, if he was content to abide with me, I should be.ever
willing to keep him.
After Friday's grief was something abated, more fully
to conv-nce me of his affection, he said, c< O master, me
u not care to be in my nation, leave you here; me desire
*r nation learn good, that's all;" meaning, that his desire
was for the conversion of that barbarous people. But as I
had no apostolic mission, nor any concern about their sal-
vation; so 1 had not the least intern ion or desire of under-
taking it; and the strength of my inclination, in order to
escape, proceeded chiefly from my late discourse with Fri-
day, about these seventeen white bearded men, that had
ibecn driven upon the Barbarian, coast; whom i designed to,
Join ^$ ^he-only meafr to further oar escape. To which
intent my man and 1 v. ent to search for a proper tree to
felk whereof we msglir. make a large perigaa or canoe, to
Bn4ertakethe voyage ;* and, indeed, we were not Jong in
finding one fit for our purpose, there being enough of wood
in ;the island to have built a fleet of large vefteh> but the
thing--we principally wanted was to get one so near the wa-
ter, that we might launch it after it was finished, and not
. commit; so horrid a mistake as I had done once before.
Well, after a great search for what was best and mod
convenient, Friday, at last, whose judgment in such affairs
was much superior to mine, pitches upon a kind of wood
the most fitting for k. To this day 1 cannot tell the name
of the tree, nor describe it any other way, than only by
saying, that it is very like what we call fustic, or between
that and the Niacaragua wood, being much of the fame
colour and smell. But though my man exceeded me in
the knowledge cf the most proper tree, yet I showed him
a much better and clearer way to make a canoe than ever
he knew before; for he was for burning the hcllcw cr ca-
vity of the tree, in order to make this boat; but I then
told him how he might do it with tools, learning him at
the fame time how to use them, which indeed he did very
dexterously; so that in a month's time we finished it, ma-
king it very handsome, by cutting the outside in the true
sliape of a boat. After this it took us a full fortnight be-
fore we could get her into the water, wnich we did as it
were inch by inch, upon great rollers; but when (he was
in, she would have carried twenty men, with all the ease
imaginable*
As I was very weH pleased, you may be sure at the
launching cf this man of war of mine, I was no less
amazed to behold with what dexterity my man would ma-
nage her, turn htr, and paddle her along* Well, Friday,
foid I, what do you think of it now? Do you think this
will carry us over r " Yes, master," said he, " me venture
"over well, though great blow wind." But my design
was yet farther, which he was insensible of 5 and that was
to make a mast and a fail, and to provide her with an, anchor
md cable. As to a mast, that was no difficult thing at.all
to procure: so I fixed upon a strait young cedar-tree,
which I found near the place, great plenty of it abounding
in the island ; and setting Friday to^cut it down, I gave
him particular directions how to stiape and order it; but as
to the sail, that I managed myself. I very well knew I
had some old ones, or pieces of falls enough, which had
Iain fix and twenty years'by me; but not being careful to
preserve them, as thinking I should have no occasion to use
them any more, when I came to overlook them/ I found
them almost all rotten, except two; and with these I went
to woik,and after a great deal of pains and awkward tedi-
ous stitching for want of needles, at length J finished a
three-cornered ugly thing, like that we call in England a
shoulder of mutton fail, to go with a boom at bottom, and
a little small sprit at the top, like those which our long-
boats use, and which I very well krjew how to manage,
especially since it was like that which I had in my patron's
stfhing boat, when, with my boy Xury, 1 made my escape
from the Barbarian shore.
Jt was near two months, I think, before I completed this
work, that if, the rigging and fitting my mast and fails;
and indeed they were nicely done, having made a small
stay and a sail, cr a foresail to it, to assist, if we ihould-
turn to the westward; and, what is still more, I fixed
a rudder to the item of her, to steer with; and though I
was but a very indifferent shipwright, yet, as I was sensi-
ble of the great usefulness and absolute necessity of a thing
like this, 1 applied myself to it with such a constant appli-
cation, that at last I accompli shed my design; but what
with the many dull contrivances I had about it, and the
failure of many things, it cost me as much pains in order-
ing-as in making the boat,. Besides, when all this was
done, I had my man to teach what belonged to its navi-
gation; for though he very we 1 understood hew to paddle
a canoe along, he was an utter stranger to a fail and a rud-
der, and was am: zed when he saw me work the boat to and"
again in the sea, by them, and how the sail gibbed and
filled this way or that way, as the course we sailed changed.
After some «.ime and a little use, I made all these things
very familiar to him, so that he became an expert sailor,
except in relation to the compass, and that I could make
him understand bat little of. Bur, as it happened, there
was seldom occasion for it, there being but little cloudy
weather, and scarce any fog in those parts; the stars were
always visible in the night, and the shore perspicuous by
day, except in the rainy season, which confined every on3
to his habitation. Thus entered in the seven and twentieth"
year of my reign, or captivity, which you please, (the
last three of which, blessed with the company of my man
Friday, ought not to be reckoned) I kept the anniversary
os rny landing here, with the same thankfulness to God,
for his tender mercies, as I did before; and certainly, as
I had great cause for a thankful acknowledgement for my
deliverance at first, I had much greater now for such sin-
gular and additional testimonies of the care of Providence
over me, in all my distresses of both body and mind, and
the great hopes i had of being effectually and speedily de-
livered; for I had a strong impression upon my mind, that
I should not be another year in this island. . Bm, however,
I still continued on with my husbandry, digging* planting,
and fencing, as usual; gathering and curing my grapes,
and doing all other things that were necessary.
And now the rainy season beginning to come on, obli-
ged me to keep the longer within doors; but before this, I
brought my new vessel into the creek, where I had landed
my rafts from the snip, and haling her up to the shore, I
ordered my man Friday to dig a dock sufficient to hold
her in, and deep enough to give her water, wherein she
might stoat; and then when the tide was out, we made a
strong dam cross the end of it, to keep out the water; by
which means she lay dry, as to the tide from the sea; and
to keep the rain from her, we thatched her over, as it were,
with boughs of trees, like a house, so we waited for the
months of November and December, in which I designed
to venture over the ocean.
No sooner did the* seasonable weather begin to dtaw
near, but so much was I elevated with this new designed
adventure, that I daily prepared for the voyage. The
sirst thing I thought on was, to lay by a certain quantity of
provisions, as a sufficient store for such an expedition, in-
tending in a week or fortnight's time to open the dock,
and to launch out the boat fpr that purpose. But one morn-
ing as I was very busy upon something necessary for this
occasion, I called Friday to me, and bid him go to the sea
ihore,,and see if he could sind a turtle or tortoise, a thing
which we commonly ;had once a week, as much upon ac-
count of the eggs, as for the fake of the flesh. He had
not been long gone, but he came running back, as though
he was pursued for life, and as it were stew over my outer
wall, or fciice, like one that feit not the ground, or steps
he set his feet on; and before I had time to inquire the
reason of his precipitation, he cries out, %t O dear mas-
il8 LI-FE 'AND ADTENnriTRFi1
"ter, O sorrow, sorrow! Bad! G bad P* Why^ whitV
the matter Friday? said I. iisO yonder, yonder !'* said
he, '* there be one, two, or three canoes 1 twothree f*\
Surely, thought 1, there most i>e fix, by my man's way df
reckoning; but on a stiicter inquiry, I soand there Were
bat three.' Well, Friday, said I, don't be terrified, I war-
rant you we will not only defend ourselves against them, but
kill the moil of these cruel savages. But though 1 com-'
sorted him in the best manner I could, the poor creature
tfembkd so, that 1 scarce knew what to do with him ;-—
"O master," said he, «• they come look Friday, cut pieces
** Friday, cutame^p." .Why, Friday, said, they will
eat me up as well as you and my danger is as great as
yours. But fince it is so, we must resolve to right for our
litres. What fay you? Can you fight, Friday? "Yes,"
said he,'« very faintly, «* me shoot, me .kill what I can, but
"there come a great many number/' That's no matter,
said I again, our guns will terrify those that we do not
kill; I am very willing to stand by you to the last drop
of my blood. Now tell me, if you will do the like by
me, and obey my orders in whatsoever I command: Fri-
day then answered, " O master, me lose life for you, me
<l die when you bid die." Thus concluding all questions
concerning his fidelity, immediately 1 fetched him a good
dram of rum, (of which I had been a very good husband)
and gave it him. to comfort his heart. After he had drank
it, I ordered him to take the two fowling-p'eces, which
we always carried, and load them with large swan-shot, as
big as small pistol bullets; then I took four maskers, and
loaded them with two slugs, a.«d .five small bullets-each;
charging my two pistols each with a brace,! hung my gfreat
sword, as customary, naked to my fide, ar*d gave Friday
his hatchet, as a most excellent, weapon for defence.
T&as prepared, I thought asjwe^l of myself as any
knight-errant that ever handled a sword and spear. I to$k
my perspective glass, and went upto the side of the hill,
to fee what 1 could discover; and 1 perceived very soon,
by my glass, that there were one and twenty savages', three
prisoners and th*ee canoes, and ithat their chief concern
seemed to be the triumphant bauquet"upon the" three poor
human bodies, a thingr^hfch by this time 1 had observed
was very common with them- 1 also remarked, that they
jdid not land at that place from whence Friday rnadc ThiV
escape, DU* nearer to, the creek, w^iere the stvore was low,
and where a tJbick wood came very close to the sea. My
sou! was then filled with indignation and abhorrence at such
inhuman wxetches, wJiich put a period to all my former
thoughts in their vindication, neither would.1 give myself
time to consider their right of conquest, as I had done be-
fore: but descending from the mountain, I came down to
Friday, and told him, 1 was revived to go speedily to
them, and kill them all; asking him again, in the same
breath, is he would stand by me: when by this time being -
recovered from. h:s fright, and his spirits much cheered
with the dram I had given him, he was very pleasant, yet
seriously telling me, as he .did before, "When I bid die,
"he would die."
And cow it was, having fixed my resolution-in so strong
a manner, that nothing could divest my breast of its un-
common fury, I immediately divided the loaded arms
betwixt us. To my man-Friday I gave a pistol to stick in
his girdle, with three guns upon his shoulder, a weight too
great, I confess, to bear;-but whatjnufl a poor king do,
who had but one soldier in the world? But to shew I niade
him bear.no more than what I.would lay on myself,. I stuck
the other pistol in my girdle, and the other three guns upon
my shoulders; nay, something more, but that was like
Æsop's burden, a small bottle of rum, which was feon
lightened to our exceeding refreshment. Thus we march-
ed out, under a ponderous.load of armour, like two invin-
cible champions, with a quantity of powder and bullets to
stand our battle, and load again, when the pieces were
discharged. And now my orders being to be obeyed, I
. charged. Friday to keep close behind me, and to: to stir,
cr shoot, or attempt any thing till I commanded him; and
in the interim, not to speak so much as one word, it was
in this order I fetched a compass to thcrighthand, of near
a .mile* as well to get over the creek, as to attain the wood;,
and by this, 1 thought to come witliin ihot of them before
I could be discerned, as I, found, oy my, glass, would not
be difficult to accomplish.
k..But how fickle and wavering is the mind of men, even
in our greatest fury and strongest inclinations? For while
I was taking "this inarch, my resolution began to abate,
rot through fear of their numbers, who were a parcel of
naked unarmed wretches, but those reflections occuned to
>*ny thc-nglas: what power vras I commiSioned with, or
what occasion or necessity had ,1 to go and embrue my
hands in human blood, and murder people that had neither
done nor intended to do me any wrong? They' were inno-
cent in particular as to me; and their barbarous custom
was not only their misfortune but a sign that God had left
them in the most immense stupidity.; but yet did not war-
rant me to be a judge of their actions, much less an exe-
cutioner of his righteous judgments: That, on the con-
trary, whenever he. thought fit, he would take vengeance
on them himself, and punisti them in a national way, ac-
cording to their national crimes; but this was nothing at
all to me, who had no concern with them. Indeed my man
Friday might justify himself, because they were his declared
enemies, of that very fame nation that went to sacrifice
him before; and, indeed, it was lawful for him to attack
them, which [ could not fay was so with, respect to me—
So warmly did these thiugs press upon my thoughts all the
way I went, that I only resolved to place mys4f so as to
behold their bloody entertainment, without falling upon
them, except something more than ordinary, by pod/s
special direction, should oblige me thereto.
Thus fixed in my resolution, I entered into th# thick
wood, (my man .Friday following me close behin<3) when
with all possible wariness and iilejice, I marched till I
came to the skirt of it, on that fide which was the nearest
to them; for only one end of the wood interposed be*
tween me and them. Upon which I called very softly to
Friday, and showing him a great tree, that was just at the
corner of the wood, I ordered him to repair thither, and
bring me word, if he could plainly perceive their actions;
accordingly he did as I commanded him, and came back
with this melancholy story, that they were all about their
fire, eating the flesh of one of their prisoners ; and that ano-
ther lay bound upon the sand, at a little distance from them,
which they designed for the next sacrifice, and this, he
tpld me was not one of their nation, but one of those very
bearded men, who were driven by a storm into their coun-
try, and of whom he had so often talked to me about.
You may be sure, that upon hearing this, my, foul was
ready to sink within me: when ascending into a tree* I
saw plainly, by my glass, a white man, who lay upon the
beach of the sea, with his hands and feet tied with flags,
or things resembling rushes, being covered with clothes,
and seemed to be an European. From the tree where I took
3
this prospect I perceived another tree and a thicket be-
yond it, about fifty yarug nearer to them than where I was,
which, by taking a small circle r^und, I might come at
undiscovered, and then 1 should be within halt a ihot os
these devourers. And this conhderation alone, to be more
perfectly revenged upon them, made me withhold my pas-
lion, though I was enraged to the highest degree imagi-
nable ; when going back about twenty paces, i got benmd
some bushes, which held all the way tiii i came to the
other tree; and then 1 ascended to a little rising ground,
•not above eighteen yards diltance, and there 1 had a lull
view of thele creatures, and i could perceive all their ac-
tions.
Such a fight did then appear as obliged me not to lose
a moment's time. No less than nineteen or theie dread-
ful wretches lat upon the ground, close huddled together,
expressing all the delight imaginable at lo barbarous an
entertainment; and they had juit lent the other two to mur-
der this poor unhappy Chriltian, and bring; him limb by
limb to their fre; for they were then juit going to untie
die bands from his feet, in order for death, as letters are
knocked off the feet ct malefactors before they go to the
place of execution. Hereupon, immediately turning to
my man, now, Priday, said 1, mind what 1 fay, fail in no-
thing, but do exactly as you fee me do. Ail which he pro-
mising he would perform, I let down one of my mulkeu,
and iowling-piece upon the ground, and Fnday did the
same by his; and with the otner musket I took my aim at
the savages, bidding him do the like: Are you ready?
said I: ** Yes, iVJaster," laid he; why then lire at them,
Said 1; and that very moment I gave fire likewise.
I only killed xme and wounded two; but my man FrU
day, taking nis aim much better than I, killed two, arid
wounded three. You may be lure they were in a dread-
ful consternation, at such an unexpected disaster, and those
who had yet escaped our penetrating Ihot, immediately
jumped upon their feet, but were in luch a confusion, that
they knew not which way to run or look; not knowing
from whence their destruction came. We threw down our
pieces, and took up others, giving a second dreadful vol-
ley ; but as they were loaded only with Iwan Ihot, or small
pistol bullets, we perceived only two of them fall; tho*
many were wounded, who run yelling and screaming about
F
like mad creatures. Now, Friday, said 1, lay down your
piece, and take up the musket, and follow me. He did so,
with great courage, when showing ourselves to the savages
we gave a great shout, and made directly to the poor vic-
tim, who would have been sacrificed, had not oar first sire
obliged the butchers, with three others, to jump into a
canoe By my order, Friday fired at them, at which shot
1 thought he had killed them ail, by reason os their falling
to the bottom os the boat; however, he killed two, and
mortally wounded a third. In the mean time, I cut the
flags that tied the hands and feet of the poor creature, and
listing him up, asked him in the Portuguese tongue, What
he <vias? He answered me in Latin, Chrijl anus ; but so very
weak and saint, that he could scarce stand or speak. Im-
mediately I gave him a dram, aud a piece os bread to
cherish him, and asked him, What countryman he was?
He fcid, Hifpamola, and then uttered all the thankfulness
imacinabie for his deliverance. Signior, said I, With as
much Spanisli as I was master of, let us talk afterwards, but
sight now; here, take this sword and pistol, and do what
you can, And, indeed, he did so with such courage and
intrepidity, that he cut two os them *,o pieces in an instant,
the savage€ not having the power to fly for their lives.
I ordered Friday to run for those pieces we had left at the
tree, which he brought me with great swiftness, and then
J gave him my mu&et, while I loaded t e rest. But now
there happened a fierce encounter between the Spaniard
and one of the savages who had made at him with one of
their wooden swords; and though the former was as brave
as could 1>e expected, having twice wounded his enemy in
the head, yet being weak and faint, the Indian had thrown
him upon the ground, and was wresting my sword out of
his hand, which the Spaniard very wisely quitting, drew out
his pistol, and (hot him through the body before I could^
come near him, though I was running to his -affirmance. As
to Friday, he pursued the flying wretches with his hatchet,
despatching three, but the rest were too nimble for him.
The Spaniard taking one of the fowling-pieces, wounded
two, who running into the wood, Friday pursued and killed j
but the other, notwithstanding hi wounds, plunged him-
stifinto the sea, arrd swam to those *rio were lest in the

The savages in the canoe worked very hard to get out
of our reach, and Friday was as eager in pursuing them;
and, indeed, I was no less anxious about their escape, left
after the news had been carried to their people, they should
return in multitudes, and destroy us. So being resolved
to pursue them, I jumped into one of their canoes, and bid
Friday follow me; bat no sooner was I in, than, to my
surprise, I found another poor creature, bound hand and
foot for the slaughter, just as the Spaniard had been, with
very little life in him. Immediately I unbound him, and
would have helped him up; but he could neithv r'stand nor
speak, M\. groaned so piteously, as thinking he was only
unbound in order to be slain. Hereupon I bid Friday
speak to him, and tell him of his deliverance; when pulling
€ut my bottle, I made the poor wretch drink a dram,
which-, with the joyful news he had received, so revived
his heart, that he fit up in the boat. As soon a* Friday
began to hear him speak, and look more fully in his face,
it would have moved any one to tears to perceive his un-
common transports of joy; frr he kissed, embraced him,
hugged him, cried, laughed, hallooed, jumped about,
danced, fung, then cried again, wrung his hands, beat his
face and head, then fung and jumped about again, like a
distracted creature; so that it was a great while before I
could make him speak to me, or tell me what was the
matter with him; but when he came to the liberty of his
speech, at lsst he told me it was his father.
Here indeed I was infinitely moved to fee that dutiful
and tender affection this poor savage had to his aged pa-
rent. He would sit down by him in the boat, open his
breast, and hold his father's head close to his bosom, half
an hour together, to cherim him: then he took his arms
and ancles, which were stirT and numbed, with binding, and
F z .
chafed and rubbed them with his hands; by which mean?,
perceiving what the cafe was, I gave him some rum, which
proved os great benefit to him.
While we were busy in this action, the savages had got*
ten almost out of sight; and happy it was we did not pur-
sue them: For there arose from the north-west, which con-
tinued all night long, such a violent storm, that I could not
suppose otherwise but that they were all drowned. After
this I called Friday to me, and asked him if he had given
his father any bread ? He {hook his head, and said, «« None,
"not one bit, me eat-a up all;" so I gave him a cake of
bread out of a little pouch I carried for this end. i like-
wise gave him a dram for himself, and two or three
bunches of raisins for his father. Both these he carried to
him, for he would make him drink the dram to comfort
him.
Away then he runs out of the boat as if he was bewitched,
with such an extraordinary swiftness, that he was out of
fight as it were in an instant; but at his return, I perceived
him slacken his pace, because he had something in his
hand. And this I found to be, as he approached nearer,
an earthen jug with some water for his father, with two
more cakes of bread, which he delivered into my.hands.
Being very thirsty myself, I drank some of the water, of
which when his father had drank sufficiently, it more re*
vived his spirits than all the rum I had given him.
I then called Friday to me, and ordered him to carry the
Spaniard one of the cakes, and some water, who was re-
posing himself under a green place, under the made of a
tree, but so weak, that though he exerted himself, he could
not stand upon his feet. Upon which 1 ordered Friday to
rub and bathe his ancles with rum, as he did his father's.
But every minute he was emploved in this he would cast
a wishful eye towards the boat, where he left his father
fitting; who suddenly disappearing, he flew like lightening
to him, and finding he had only laid himself down to ease
his limbs, he returned back to me presently, and then I
*spoke to the Spaniard to let Friday help him, and lead
him to the boat, in order to be conveyed to my dwelling,
where I would take care him. Upon which Friday took
him upon his back, and so carried him to the canoe, set-
ting nim close by his father; and presently stepping out
again, launched the boat off, and paddled it along the shore
faster than I could walk, though the wind blew very hard
too, and havin? brought them safe to the creek, away her
runs to fetch the other cance, which he brought to the
creek almost as sorn as I got to it by land, when wafting
me over, he took our new guests out of the bo3t; but so
weak were they, that I was forced to make a kind of a
hand-barrow; and when I came to my castle, not being
willing to make an entrance into my wall, we made them
a handsome tent covered with old sa'ls, and boughs of trees,
making two good beds of rice straw, with blankets to lie
upon and cover them. Thus, like an absolute king over
subjects who owed their lives to me, I thought myself very
considerable, especially as I had now three religions in my
kingdom, my man Friday^being a Protestant, his father a
Pagan, and the Spaniard'a. Papist: but I gave liberty of
conscience to them all.
To get provisions for my poor weak subjects, I ordered
Friday to kill me a yearling goat: which when he had
done, I cut off the hinder quarters, and chopping it into
small pieces, boiled and stewed it, putting barley and rice
into the broth. This I carried into their tent, set a table,
dined with them myself, and encouraged them. Friday-
was my interpreter to his father, and indeed to the Spaniard
too, who spoke the language of the savages pretty well.
After dinner I ordered Friday to fetch home all our arms
from the field of battle, and the next day to bury the dead
bodies, which he did accordingly.
And now I made Friday inquire of his father, whether
he thought these savages had escaped the late storm in their
canoe? and if so, whether they would not return with a
power too great for us to resist? He answered, that he
thought it impossible they could outlive the storm; or, if
they were diiven southwardly,,they would come to a land
where they would as certainly be devoured, as if they were
drowned in the sea. And suppose they had attained their
own country, the strangeness of their fatal and bloody at-
tack, would make them tell their people, that the rest of
them were killed by thunder and lightening, not by the
hand of man, but by two heavenly spirits (meaning Fri-
day and me) who were sent from above to destroy them.
And this, he said, he knew, because he heard them say
the same to one another. And indeed he was in the right
on't; for I have heard since, that these four men gave out
that whoever went to that inchanted island, would be de-
stroyed by sire from the gods.
**3
No canoes appearing soon after, as I expected, my ap-
prehensions ceased: Instead os which my forme* thoughts
of a voyage to k place, especally when Friday's father as-
sured me, 1 snould have go d usage in his nation. As to
the Spaniard he told me, that sixteen more os his Coun-
trymen and Portuguese, who had been shipwrecked, made
their escape thither; that though they were in union with
the savages, yet they were very miserable for want os pro-
visions and other necessaries. When 1 asked him about
the particulars of his voyage, he answered that their ship
was bcund from the Rio de la Plata to the Havannah ; that
wh'n the (hip was lost, only five men perished in the ocean;
the rest having saved themselves in the boat, were now
1 nded on the main continent. And what do they intend to
do there? said 1. He replied, they have concerted mea-
sures to escape, by building a vessel, but that they had nei-
ther tools ncr provisions, To that all their designs came to
nothing. Supposing, laid I, i sliould make a proposal, and
invite them here, would they not carry me prisoner to New
Spain? he answered no; for he knew them to be such ho-
uest men, as would scorn to act such inhuman baseness to
their deliverer: That, if I pleased, he and the eld savage
would go over to them, talk with them about it, and bring
me an answer: That they should all swear fidelity to me as
their leader, upon the Holy Sacrament; and, scr his part,
he would not only do the fame, but stand to the last drop
of his blood, should there be occasion.
These solemn assurances made me resolve to grant them
relief, and to send these two over for that purpose; but
when every thing was ready, the Spaniard raised an ob-
jection, which carried a great deal os weight in it: "You
«« know, Sir," said he, " that having been some time with
.*• you, 1 cannot but be sensible os your stock of rice and
•« corn, sufficient, perhaps, for us at present, but not for
«' them, should they come over presently; much less to
«' victual a vessel for an intended voyage. Want might
«« he as great an occasion for them to disagree and rebel,
"as the children of Israel did against God himself, when
«• they wanted bread in the wilderness. And, therefore,
*r my advice is, to wait another harvest, and in the mean
•* time cultivate and improve some more land, whereby
** we may have plenty of provisions, in order to execute
«' out design."
This advice of the Spaniard*!) I approved extremely
and so satisfied was I of his fidelity, that I esteemed him
ever after. And thus we all four went to work upon some
more land, and against seed time we had gouen so m.ich
cured and trimmed up,sufficient to sow twenty-t.vo bushels
of barley on, and sixteen jars of rice, which was, in short,
all the seed we had to spare. As we were four in number,
and by this time all in good health, we feared not an hun-
dred Indians, should they venture to attack us ; and while
the corn was growing, I pitched upon some trees, fit to
build us a large vessel, in case the Spaniards came over;
which being marked, I ordered Friday and his father to
cut them down, appointing the Spaniard, who was now my
privy counsellor, to oversee and direct the the work. I like-
wise increased my flocks of goats, by shooting the wild
dams, and bringing home their kids to my bclosuie: Nor
did I negUct the grape season, bat cured them as usual,
though I had such a quantity now, as would have filled
eighty barrels with raisins. And thus all of us being em-
ployed, they in working, and I in providing for them, till
harvest came, God Almighty blessed the increase of it so
much, that from twenty-two barrels of barley, we thrashed
out two hundred and twenty, and the like quantity of rice,
sufficient to victual a ship fk to carry me and all the Spa-
niards to any part of America
Thus the principal objection being answered, by a susj
ficient stock of provisions, I sent my two ambassadors over
to the main land, vuth a regal authority to administer the
oaths of allegiance and fidelity, and have an instrument
signed under their hands, though I never asked whether
they had penr ink or paper; when giving each of them a
musket, eight charges of powder and ball, and provisions
enough for eight days, they sailed away with a fair gale,
on a day when the moon was at full.
Scarce a fortnight had passed over my head, Sut im-
patient for their return, I laid me down to sleep one morn-
ing, when a strange accident happened, which was ushered
in by Friday's coming running to me, and calling aloud,
"Master, master, they are come, they are come." Upon
which, not dreaming of any danger, out I jumped from my
bed, put on my clothes, and hurried through my little
grove; when looking towards the sea, I perceived a boat
about a league and a half distant, standing in for the shore
with the wind fair. I beheld- they did not come from the
side where the land lay on, but from the southermost end
*4
of the island •. So these being none of the people we want*
ed, I ordered Friday to lie still, till such time as I came
down from the mountain, which, with my ladder, I now
ascended, in order to discover more fully what they were;
and now, with the help of my perspective glass, T plainly
perceived an English ship, which I concluded it to be, by
the fashion of its long boat; and which filled me with such
uncommon transports of joy, that I cannot tell how to de-
scribe; and yet some secret doubts hung about me, pro-
ceeding from I know not what cause, as though I had rea-
son to be upon my guard. And, indeed, 1 would have
no man contemn the secret hints and intimations of danger,
which very often are given, when he may imagine there
is no possibility of its being real; for had I not been warn-
ed by this silent admonition, I had been in a worse situation
than before, and perhaps inevitably ruined.
Not long it was, before I perceived the boat to approach
the stiore, as though they looked for a place where they
xnight conveniently land; and at last they ran their boat
on shore upon the beach, about half a mile's distance;
which proved so much the happier for me, since, had they
come into the creek, they had landed just at my door, and
might not only have forced me out of my castle, but plun-
dered me of all 1 had in the world. Now I was fully con-
vinced they were all Englishmen, three of which were un-
armed and bound; when immediately the first four or five
leaped on (hore, and took those three out of the boat as
prisoners; one of whom I could perceive used the most
passionate gestures of entreaty, affliction, and despair, while
the others, in a lesser degree, showed abundance of con-
cern.
Jtfot knowing the meaning cf this, I was very much
astonished, and J beckoned to Friday, who was below, ro
ascend the mountain, and likewise vievv this fight. *' O
"master," said he to me, "you see English mans eat
"prisoners as well as Savage mans." And do you think
they will eat them, Friday? said I. " Yes,'' said Friday,
t( they ear-a all up." No, no, said I, Friday, I am much
more concerned lest they murder them, but as for eating
them up, that I am sure they will never do.
And now I not only lamented my misfortune in not hav-
ing the Spaniard and Savage with me, but also that I could
not come within shot of them unperceived, they having
no fire arms among them) and save these three men, whom
O? F01HNSON CRU-SOl. 120; ^
I thought they were going to kill with their swords. But
some comfort it was to me, that I perceived they were set
at liberty to go where they pleased, the rascally seamen
scattering about as though they had a mind to seethe
place; and so long did they negligently ramble, that the*
tide had ebbed so low, as to leave the bop.t aground. Nor
were the two men who were in her more circumspect; for.
having drunk a little toe much liquor, they fell fall asleep;
but one of them waking before the other, and perceiving
the boat too fait aground for his strength to move it, he
hallooed out to the rest, who made all poUible expedition
to come to him; btt as Providence ordered it, all their
force was ineffectual to launch her, when [ could hear them
speak to one another, c< Why let her alone, Jack, can't
ye; she'll stoat next tide;" by which words I was fully
convinced they were my own countrymen. I all this while
lay very quiet, as being'fully sensible it could be no less?
than ten hours before tiie boat would be afloat, and then ic
would be so daik; that they could not easily perceive me,,
by which means 1 should be at more liberty to hear their
talk, and observe all .their motions: not but that I prepared .
for my defence: yet, as I had another fort of enemy to
combat with, I acted with more caution. . I took two fu-
sses on my shoulder, and gave Friday three muskets; be-
sides my formidable goat-skin coat and monstrous cap made *
me look as fierce and terrible as Hercules of old, especially
when two pistols were stuck- in my belt, and my naked \
swerd hanging by my side.*
It was my design at first not to make any attempt till it:
was dark.; ;and it being now two o'clock, in the very heat
of the day, the sailors were all straggling in the woods, and
undoubtedly werelaja down to sleep. The three poor dis- *
tress,d creatures, too anxious to get any repose, were how-
ever seated under the shade of a great tree, abouLa quarter -
of a mile from me. Upon which, without any more ado, .
I,approached towards them, with my man following be-
hind me, and, before I was perceived, I called .aloud to <
them in Spanisi?, " What are ye, Gentlemen?"
At these words, theystartedoipjn greatconfufion,when
they beheld the strange figure I made; they returned no
answer, but seemed as if they would sty from me: "Gen- -
"tlemenv" said I,* in English; " don't be afraid, perhaps
"you have a friend nearer than you expect." "He must *
"te.from Heaven/' said one of them, gravely pulling ofEf
his hat, "for we arc past all help in this world." "All
*' help is from Heaven,'* said I: " But Sir, as I have per-
"ceived every action between you and these brutes since
*( your landing, only inform me how to assist you, and I
*' will do it to the utmost of my power."
"Ami talking with God or man," said he, in melting
tears. <l Are you of human kind or an angel?" «« Sir,"
said I, •' my poor hab,k will tell you I am a man, and an
*' Englishman, willing to assist you, having but this servant.
*' only: here are arms and ammunition: tell freely your
"condition: Can we save you?" (t The story," said he,.
"is too long to relate, since our butchers are so near: but,
"Sir, I was master of that stiip, my men have mutinied,.
*( and v is a favour they have put my mate, this passenger,
*' and me, on shore without murdering us, though we ex-
*' pect nothing but peiifhing here.1' u Are your enemies
** gone?" said 1. €t No," replied he, pointing to a thicket,
4€ tfierethey lie, while my heart trembles, lest, having seen
*f and heard us, they should murder us all*" '* Have they
*' sire arm-s?" said I. iC They have but two pieces/'
said he, «* one of which is left in the boat." He also told
me there were two enormous villains among them, that
were the author* of this mutiny, who> if they were killed
or seized, might induce the rest to return to their obedi-
ence, t( Well, well," said I, fi let us retire farther under
4t the covering cf the woods j" and there it was I made
these conditions with him-:
I. That, while they st*ud in the island, they should not
pretend to any authority; but should entirely conform to
my orders, and return me the arms which I should put in
their hands.
II. That, if the ship was recovered, they mould afford
Friday and myself a passage gratis to England..
When hehid^iven me all the satisfaction I could desire,
1 gave him £nd his two companions each of them a gun,
with powder and ball sufficient, advising them to sire upon
them as they lay steeping. The Captain modestly said,
that he was sorry to kill them; though, on the other hand,
to let these villains escape, who were the authors of his mi-
fery, might be the ruin of us all. "Well*" said he, " do
*« as you think fit;" and so accordingly I fired, killed one of
the Captain's chief enemies and wounding the other, who
eagerly called for assistance; but the Captain who had re-
served his piece, coming up to him, "Sirrah," said he,
"'Us too late to call for assistance, you should rather cry
f* to God to pardon your villany;" and so knocked him
down with the stock of his gun; three others were alfa
slightly wounded, who at my approach cried out for
mercy. This the Captain granted, upon condition thai
they would swear to be true to him in recovering the ship,
which they solemnly did; however I obliged the Captain
to keep them bound. Aster which I sent Friday and the
Captain's mate to secure the boat and bring away the oars
and fails; when, at their return, three men coming back,
and seeing their late distressed Captain, now their conque-
ror, submitted to be bound also. And then it was, that
having more liberty, I related the adventures of my whole
life, which he heard with a serious and wonderful attention,.
After [his, I carried him and his two companions into my
little fortified castle, showed them all my conveniences, and
refreshed them with such provisions as I could afford.
When this was over, we began to consider about regaining
the ship: he said, that there were twenty-six hands on-
boardi who knowing their lives were forfeited by the law*.
for conspiracy and mutiny, were so very hardened, that it
would be dangerous for our small company to attack them.
This was a reasonable inference indeed; but something we
must resolve on, and immediately put in execution: we,
therefore, heaved the boat upon the beach so high that sn?
could not shoot cŒ at high water mark, and broke a hole
in her not easily.to be (topped; so that all ths signals they
gave for the boat to come on board were in vain. This
cbiiged them to fend another boat ashore, with ten men
armed, whose faces the Captain plain!;' descried, the
boatswain being the chief officer ;,but he said there were
three honest lads among them, who were forced into the
conspiracy. Hereupon I gave him fresh courage (for I.
had perceived he was in concern) l in the mean while se-
curing our prisoners j except two, whom we .took-to our
assistance, we thought ourselves able enough to adventure a
battle. When the sailors landed* and beheld their boat in
that condition, they not only hallooed, but sired for their
companions to hear, yet they received no answer." This
struck them with horror and amazement, thinking their
companions were, murdered, they made as^if they would
return to the ship. I could perceive the Captain's coun-
tenance change at this, till of a sudden, three men were.
fordered to look after the boat, while the other seven leapt,
oa shore in order to search for their companions; arid,-
F.6'
indeed, they came to the brow of the hill, near my ancient
cast le, from whence they could see to a great distance in
the woods, and there shouting and hallooing till tired and
weary, they at length seated themselves under a spreading
tree. My opinion was, that nothing could be done till
night, when I might use some artsice to get them all out
of the boat; but of a sudden they started up, and made
to the sea-side; hereupon, I ordered Friday and the Cap-
tain's mate to go over the creek, and halloo as loud as they
could, and so decoying them into the woods, come round
to me again. And this, indeed, had good effect; for they
followed the noise, till coming westward to the creek, they
called for their boat to carry them over, and taking one
os the men cut of her, lest two to look after her, having
fastened her to the stump os a little tree on (bore. Here-
upon immediately the Captain and our party pasting the
creek, out of their light, we surprised them both, by the
Captain's knocking down one, and ordering the other to
surrender upon pain of death, and who being the honestest
of them all, sincerely joined with us. By this time it was
pretty late; when the rest returning to their boat, which,
they found aground in the creek, the tide out, and the men
gone, they ran about wringing their hands, crying it was
an enchanted island, and that they should be all murdered
by spirits or devils. My men would willingly have fallen
upon them, but f would not agree to hazard any of our
party. But, to be more certain, Friday and the Captain
crawled upon their hands and feety as near as possible; and
when the boatswain approached in sight, so eager was the
Captain, that he fired and killed him on the spot; Friday
wounded the next man, and a third ran away.. Hereupon
I.advanced with my whole army; and, it being dark, I
ordered the man we had surprised in the boat, to call them
by their names, and to parley with them. Accordingly he
called out alnud, ** Tom Smith, Tom Smith!" He an-
swered, " Who's that?" '• Robinson Vs answered the other.
09 For God's fake Tom,,surrender immediately, or you're
11 all dead men." ** Who must we surrender to?" says
Smith. "To our Captain and fifty men here, who have
< taken me prisoner, wounded Will Frye, and killed the
•' boatswain." '" Shall we have quarters then?" said he.
Hereupon the Captain calls out, " You Smith, you know
** my voice, surrender immediately, and you shall all have
«-your lives granted, except WiH Atkins," Hereup&n
Atkins cries out, <c What have I done Captain, more t|an
"the rest, who have been as bad as me?" But that was a
lie, for he was the person that laid hold of him, and bound
him* However, he was ordered to submit to the governor's
mercy, for such was I called. And so, laying down their
arms, we bound them all, and seized on their boat.
After this, the Captain expostulated with them, telling
them that the governor was an Englishman, who mi^ht
execute them there; but he thought they would be sent to
England, except Will Atkins, who was ordered to prepare
for death next morning. Hereupon Atkirs implored the
Captain to intercede for his life, and the rest begged they
might not be sent to England. This answered our pro-
ject for seizing the ship. For after sending Atkins and
two of the worst fast bound to the cave, and the rest being
committed to my bower, I sent the Captain to treat v,ith
them in the governor's name, offering them pardon if they
would assist in recovering the ship. Upon which they all
promised to stand by him till the last drop of their blood;
and whoever acted treacherously, should be hanged in
chains upon the beach. They were all released on these
assurances; and then the Captain repaired to the other
boat, making his passenger Captain of her, and gave him
f6ur men well armed; while himself, his mate, and five
mere, went in the other boat. By midnight they came
within call of the (hip, when the Captain ordered Robin-
son to hale her, and tell them that with great difficulty
they had found the men at last. But while they were dis-
coursing, the Captain, his mate, and the rest entered, and
knocked down the second mate and carpenter, secured
those that weit upon the deck, by putting them under
hatches, while the other boat's crew entered and secured
the forecastle; they then broke into the round-house, where
the mate, after some resistance, shot the pirate captain
through the head, upon which all the rest yielded them-
selves prisoners. And thus the ship being recovered, the
joyful signal was fired, which I heard with the greatest joy
imaginable: nor was it long before he brought the ship to
an anchor at the creek's mouth, where coming to me una-
wares, ** There," fays he, *« my dearest friend and de-
** liverer, there is your ship, and we are your servants:"
a comfort so unspeakable, as made me swoon in his arms*
while, with gratitude to Heaven, we were tenderly emu-
bracing each other*
Nothing now remaining, but to consult what we should
do with the prisoners, whom he thought it was not safe to
take on board. Hereupon concerting with the Captain, I
caressed myself in one of his suits, and sending for them,
told them, Uiat I was going to leave the island with all my
people, if they would tarry there, their lives should be
spared; if not, they should be hanged at the first port they
came at. They agreed to stay. Hereupon I told them
my whole ftvry, charging them to be kind to the Spaniards
that were expected, gave them all my arms, and informing
them of every thing necessary for their subsistence, I and
my man Friday went on board. But the next morning
two of the men came swimming to the ship's side, desiring
the Captain to take them on board, though he hanged
them afterwards, complaining mightily how barbarously
tiie others used them. Upon which I. prevailed with the
Captain to take them in; aud being severely whipt and
pickled, they proved more honest for the future. And
so I bid farewel to this island, carrying along with me
my money, my parrot, umbrella, and goat-ikin cap; set-
ting sail December 12, 1686, after twenty-eight years,
two months, and nineteen days residence, that same day
and month that I escaped from Salee, landing in England
June 11, 1687, after five and thirty years absence from
my own country, which rendered me altogether a stranger
there.
Here I found my first Captain's widow alive, who had
buried a second husband, but in very mean circumstances,
and whom I made easy upon his account. Soon after I
went down to Yorkshire, where all my family were ex-
pired, except two sisters, and as many ofone of my bro-
ther's children. I found no provision had been made for
me, they concluding I had been long since dead; so that
J was but Li a very slender ilation, indeed the Captain
did me a great kindness, by his repoit to the owners,
how 1 had delivered their staip on the Desolate Island, upon
which they made me a present of 2col. sterling. I next
went to Lisbon, taking my man Friday with me, and
there arriving in April, 1 met the Portuguese Captain,
who had taken me on board on the African coast; but,
being ancient, he had left 0if the sea, and resigned all his*
business to his son, who followed the Brazil trade. So
altered both of us were, that we did not know each other*
at first, till I discovered myself more fully to him* Afieæ
a few embraces, I began to inquire of my concerns; and
then the old gentleman told me, that it was nine years since
he had been at Brazil, where my partner was then living,
but my trustees were both dead; that he believed I should
have a good account of the product of my plantation; that
the imagination of my being lost, had obliged my trustees
to give an estimate of my share to the procurator fiscal,
who, in case of my not returning, had given one third to
the king and the rest to the monastery of St. Augustine: but
if I put in my claim, or any one for me, it would be re-
turned, except the yearly product which was given to the
poor. I then desired: hem to tell me what irn prove men t
he thought had been made of my plantation, and whether
he imagined it was worth my while to look after it? he
answered, he did not know how much it was improved ^
but this he was certain of, that my partner was grown
vastly rich upon his half of it; and, that he had been in-
formed, that the king had 200 moidores per annum for his
third part. He added, that the survivors of my trustees
were persons of an ingenuous character; that my partner
could witness my title, my name being registered in the
country, by which means I should indispensibly recover
considerable sums of money. But, anfvered I, how
could my trustees dispose of my effects, when I made yoa
only my heir? This, said he, was true; but, there being
no affidavit made of my death, he could not act as my
executor. However, he had ordered his son, (then ae
Brazil) to act by procuration upon my account, and he
had taken possession of my sugar-house, having accounted
himself for eight years with my partner and trustees for
the profits, of which he would give me a very good ac-
count.
And, indeed, this he performed very faithfully in a few
days, making himself indebted to me 470 moidores of goid> .
over and above what had been lost at sea* after I had left
the place. And then he recounted to me what misfor-
tunes he had gone through, which forced my money out
of his hands, to buy part in a new ship: " but,'' fays he,
"you shall not want, take this; and, when my son returns,
"every farthing strail be paid you." Upon which he put
into my hand a purse of 150 moidores in gold, as likewise
the instrument, containing the title to the ship which \m
son was in, and which he offered as security for the remain-
der* But really when i saw so much goodness, generosity
tenderness, and real honesty, I had not the heart to accept
it, for fear he should straiten himself upon my account.
** It is true," said he, *« it may be so ; but then the money-
•* is yours, net mine, and you may have the greatest cc-
*' casion for it." However, I returned fifty of them back
again, premising that J would freely forgive him the other
hundred when I got my effects into my hands, and that I,
deiigr.ed to go myself for that purpose. B^it he told me
he could save me that trouble, and so caused me to enter
my name with a puhl;c notary, as likewise my affidavit,
with a procuration affixed to it; and this he ordered me to
fend in a letter to one of his acquaintance, a merchant in
Brazil; and, indeed, nothing could be more faithfully and*
honourably observed,* for, in seven months time, I had a
very faithful account of all my effects, what sums of mo-
ney were raised, what expended, and what remained for
my use: In a word, I sound myself to be worth 5000!.-
sterling, and 1000 per annum. Nor was this all; for my
partner congratulated me upon my being alive, telling me
how much my plantation was improved, what Negros were
at work, and how many Ave Marias he had said to the
Virgin Mary for my preservation, desiring-me to accept
Ih'ndly some presents he had sent me, which I found showed
the greatest generosity.
No sooner did the ship arrive, but I rewarded my faith-
ful Captain, by returning Kim the hundred moidores, and-
not only forgiving him al! he owed me, I allowed him
yearly a hundred more, and fifty to his son, during their
Jives. And now being resolved to go to England, I re-
turned letters of thanks to the Prior of St. Augustine, and
in particular to my old partner, with very suitable presents.
By the Captain's advice, I was persuaded to go by land to
Calais, and. there take passage for England; when, as it
happened, 1 got a young English gentleman, a merchant's
son at Lisbon, to accompany me, together with two En-
glish, and two Portuguese gentlemen; so that with a Por-
tuguese servant, an EngiHh sailor, and my man Friday,
there were nine of us in number.
Thus armed and equipped; we set out, and came to Ma*
drid, when the summer decaying, we hasted to Navarre, .
where we were informed, that there was scarcely any pas-
sing, by reason of the prodigious quantity of snow; so that:
we were obliged to abide near twenty days at Pampeluna*,
and at last to take a guide to conduct us safe towards Tha^ •
louse. And now twelve other gentlemen joining with us*
together with their servants, we had a very jolly company.
Away cur guide led us by frightful mountains, and
through so many intricate mazes and windings, that we in-
sensibly passed them, which, as we travelled along, ushered
us into the prospect of the fruitful and charming provinces
of Languedoc and Gafcoigne.
But now came on two adventures, both tragical and co-
mical. First, our guide was encountered by three wolves
and a bear, who set upon him and his horse, and wounded
him in three places; upon which my man, riding up to his
assistance, shot one of them dead upon the spot, which
made the others retire into the woods. But the pleasantest
adventure was, to beho'd my man attack the bear. 'Tis
such a creature, that if you let him alone, he will never
meddle with you; and this my man very well knew, and
so begging leave of me in broken English, he told us, " he
** would make good laugh." «' Why, you silly fool," said
I, « he'll eat you up at a mouthful." ft Eatee me up,'*
replied he, by way of scorn, «* me not only eatee him, but
44 make much good laugh." Upon which, pulling off his
boots, he claps on his pumps, and running after the mon-
strous beast * he called out, that he wanted to discourse with
him, and then throwing stones on purpose to incense him,
the beast turns about in fury, and, with prodigious strides,
fhufHes after him. But though he was not swift enough to
keep up pace with Friday, who made up to us as it were
for help; yet being angry, *' You dog," said I, "imine-
Cf diately take horse, and let us ihoot the creature" But
he cried, " Dear master, no shoot, me make you laugh
"much." And so he turned about, making signs to fol-
low, while the bear ran after, till coming to a great oak,
he ascended in a minute, leaving his gun at the bottom of it.
Nor did the bear make any difficulty of n, but ascended
like a cat, though his weight was very great. You must
consider I was not a little amazed at the folly of my man,
as not perceiving any thing to occasion our laugnter, till
fjch time as we rode up nearer, and beheld the beast
mounted upon the oak, on the beginning of the fame
branch, to which Friday clung at the farther end, where
the bear durst not come. Hereupon Friday cried out,
*' Now, master, me make much laugh, me make bear
"dance." Upon which he fell a shaking the bough,
which made the creature look behind him, to fee how he
could retreat. Then as if the bear had understood his
stammering English; " Why you no come farther, Mr.
*' Bear r" said he, '* pray, Mr. Bear, come farher;" and
then indeed we all burst into a laughter, especially when we
perceived Friday drop like a squirrel upon the ground,
leaving the beait to make the best of his way down the
tree. And now thinking it the most convenient time to
shoot the creature, Friday cried out, ** O dear master, no
•' (hoot, me (hoot by and by;" when taking up the gun,
"me no shoot yet," said he, *' me make one more much
"laugh" And accordingly he was as good as his word;
for the creature descending backwaids from the tree very
leisurely, before he could hy one foot on the ground, Fri-
day shot him through the ear, stone dead; and looking to
see whether we were pleased, he burst out into a hearcy
laughter, saying, «« So we kill de bear in my country, not
•' with the gun, but uith much long arrows." Thus ended
tur diversion, to our great satisfaction; especially in a
j lace where the terrible howlings struck us with a continual
terror. But the snows now growing very deep, particu-
lar iy on the mountains, the ravenous creatures were then
obliged to seek for sustenance in the villages, were coming
by surprise on the country people, kil'ed several of them,
besides a great number of their sheep and horses*
Our guide told os^ we had yet one more dangerous
place to pass by; and if there were any more wolves in
- the country, there we should find them. This was a small
plain encompassed with woods, to get through a long lane
to the village where we were to lodge. When we entered
the wood, the fun was within half an hour of setting; and
a little after it was set, we came into the plain, which
was not above two furlongs over, and then we perceived
five great wclves cross the road, without taking notice of
us, and so swift as though they were pursuing after their
prey. Hereupon our guide, believing there were more
coming, desired us to be upon our guard. Accordingly
our eyes were very circumspect, till about half a lea^tre
farther, we perceived a dead horse, and near a dozen of
wolves devouring its carcase. My man Friday fain would
have sired at them, but I would not permit him; nor had
we gone half over the plain, but we heard dreadful howl-
ings in a wood on our left, when presently we saw an hun-
dred come up against us, as though they had been an ex-
perienced army. This obliged us to form ourselves in tha*
best manner; and then I ordered that every other rpan
should sire, that those who did not, might be ready to give
a second volley, should they advance upon us; and then
every man should make use of his pistols. But there was
no necessity for this; for the enemy being terrified, stop-
. ped at the noise of the fire; four of ihem were ihot dead,
and several others being wounded, went bleeding away, as
we could very plainly discover by the snow. And now re-
membering what had been often told me, that such was
the majesty of a man's voice, as to strike terror even in
the fiercest creatures, I ordered all our companions to hal-
loo as load as possible; and in this notion 1 was not alto-
gether mistaken; for they immediately turned about uron
the first halloo, and began to retire; upon which, ordering
a second volley in their rear, they galloped into the woods
with great precipitation.
Thus we had some small time to load our pieces again,
and then made all the haste we could on our way; bat we
had not rode far, before we were obliged to put ourselves in
a pesture of defence as before, being alarmed wiih a very
dreadful ncife in the fame wood, on our left hand, the fame
way as we were to pas?, only that it was at some distance
from us. By this time the darksome clouds began to spread
over the elements, and the night growing very duiky,
made it so much the mere to our disadvantage; but still
the ncise increasing, we were fully assured, that it was the
howling and yelling of those ravenous creatures; when
presently three troops of wclves on our front, appeared in
fight, as though a great number of them had a design to
surround us, and devour us in spite of fate. But as they
did not fall upon us immediately, we proceeded on our
journey in as swift a manner as the roads would permit our
horses, which was only a large trot. It was in this man-
ner we travelled, till such a time as we discovered another
wood, and had the prospect of its entrance through which
we were to pass, at the farthest fide of the plain. But
surely none can express the terror we were in, when ap-
proaching the lane, we perceived a confused number of thje
fiercest wolves, standing, as it were, guarding its entrance.
Nor were we long in this amazement, before another occa-
sion of hoffor presented itself; for suddenly we heard the
report of a gun at another opening in the wood, and,
looking that way, out ran a horse bridled and fsiddkd, flying
with the greatest swiftness, and no.less than sixteen or sen
venteen wolves pursuing after him, in order to devour the"
poor creature; and unquestionably they did so, after they
had run him down, not being able to hold out that swiftness
with which he at first escaped them.
When we rode up to that entrance from whence the horse
came forth, there lay the carcases os another horse and two
men, mangled and torn by these devouring wolves: and
undoubtedly one of these men was the person who fired the
gun which we had heard, for the piece lay by him; but,
alas I most of the upper part of his body and his head were
entombed in the bowels of these ravenous creatures.
What course to take, whether to proceed or retreat, we
could not tell; but it was not long before the wolves them-
selves made us to come to a resolution; for such numbers
surrounded us, every one of whom expected their prey,
that were our bodies to be divided among them, there
would not be half a mouthful a-piece. But happy, very
happy it was for us, that but a little way from the entrance,
there lay some very large timber trees* which I supposed
had been cut down and laid there for sale; amongst which
I drew my little troop, placing ourselves in a line behind
one long tree, which served us for a breast work, when de-
firing them to alight, we stood in a triangle, or three front?,
closing our bodies in the centre, the only place where we
could preserve them.
. Never certainly was there a more furious charge thai*
ivhat the wolves made upon us in this place; and the light
of the horses, which was the principal prey they aimed at,
provoked their hunger, and added to their natural fierceness.
They came on us with a most dreadful noise, that made the
woods ring again; and beginning to mount the pieces of
timber, I ordered every man to sire, as before directed:
and, indeed, so well did they take their aim, that they
killed several of the wolves at the first volley; but still we
wert; obliged to keep a continual filing, by reason they
came on like devils, pushing one another with the greateH
fury. Bu-t our second volley something abated their
courage, when stopping a little, we hoped they would have
made the best of their way; however, it did not prove so,
for others made a new attempt upon us; and though in
four firings we killed seventeen or eighteen of them, lam-
ing twice as many, yet they several times successively came
on, as though they valued not their lives for the fake of
their prey.
Unwilling was I to spend our last (hot too suddenly, and
therefore calling my other servant, and giving him a horn
of powder, bid him lay a large train quite along the tim-
ber, which he did, while F/iday was charging my fusee
and his own, with the greatest dexterity. By this time
the wolves coming up the timber, 1 set sire to the train,
by snapping a discharged pistol close to the powder. This
so scorched and terrified them, that some fell down, and
others jumped in among us; but these were immediately
despatched, when all the rest, frighted with the light, which
the darksome night caused to appear more dreadful, began
at length to retire; upon which, ordering our last piltols
to be fired at once, giving at the fame time a great shout,
the wolves were obliged to have recourse to their swift-
ness, and turn tail; and then we sallied out upon twenty
lame ones, cutting them in pieces with our swords, which
obliged them to howl lamentably, to the terror of their
fellows, who resigned to us the field as victorious conque-
rors. And, indeed, I question whether Alexander, king of
Macedonia, in any of his conquests, had more occasion for
triumph than we had; for he was but attacked with nume-
rous armies of soldiers 5 whereas our little army was obliged
to combat a legion of devils, as it were, worse than the can-
nibals, who, the fame moment they had slain us, would
have sacrificed us, to satisfy their voracious appetites.
Thus ended our bloody battle with the beasts, having
killed threescore of them, and saved our lives from their
fury. We still had a league farther sto go, when, as we
went, our ears were saluted with their most unwelcome
bowlings, and we expected every moment another attack.
But, in an hour's time, we arrived at the town where we
were to ledge; and here we sou? d the place strictly guard-
ed, and all in terrible confusion, as well theymight, for
fear of the bears and wolves breaking into the village, in
order to prey upon their cattle and people. The next
morning we were obliged to take a new guide, by reason
the other fell very bad of his wounds, which he had re%
ceived, as before mentioned. After we had reached Thou-
Jouse, we came into a warm, pleasant, and fruitful country,
not infested with wolves, nor any fort of ravenous crea-
tures; and when we told our story there, they much
blamed our guide, for conducting us through the forest at
4he foot of the mountains, in such a severe season, when
the snow obliged the wolves to seek for shelter in the woods.
When we informed them in what manner we placed our-
selves, and the herfes in the centre, they exceedingly re-
prehended us, and t Id us, it was an hundred t.» one, but
we had been all destroyed; for that it was the very sight
of the horses, their so much desired prey, that made the
wolves more raging!v furious than they would have been,
which was evident, by their being at other times really
afraid of a gun; but then being exceedingly hungry and
furious upon that account, their eagerness to come at the
horses mad* them insensible of their danger; and that,
if we had not, by a continual fire, and at last by the cun-
ning stratagem of the train of powder, got the better of
them, it had been great odds if their number had not
overpowered us; besides, it was a great mercy we alight-
ed from our horses, and fought them with that courage
and conduct, which, had we failed to do, every man of us,
with our beasts, had been devoured; and, indeed, this
was nothing but truth: for never, in my life, was I so *
sensible of danger, as when three hundred devils came
roaring upon us, to snun whose unwelcome company, if I
was sure to roeet a storm every week, I would rather go a
thou sand 4ea£U*s by sea.
I think I have nothing uncommon in my passage through
France to take notice of, since other travellers of greater
learning and ingenuity, have given a more ample account
than my pen is able to set forth. From Tholouse 1 tra-
velled to Paris, from thence to Calais, where I took ship-
ping, and landed at Dover the 14th of January, in a very
cold season,
Thus come to the end of my travels, I soon discovered
my new found estate, and all the bUs of exchange i had
were currently paid. The good ancient widow, my only
privy counsellor, thought no pains nor care too great to
procure my advantage; nor had I ever occasion to blame
her fidelity, which drew from me an ample leward. I was
for leaving my effects in her hands, intending to set out for
LHbon, and so the Brazils; but a-- in the Desolate 1 stand
I had some doubts about the Romish religion, so 1 knew
here was little encouragement to settle there, unless I would
apostatize from the orthodox faith, or live in continual
fear of the Inquisition. Upon this account I resolved to
sell my plantation; and, for thaf intent, I wrote to my old
friend at Lisbon, who returned me an answer to my great
satisfaction; which was, that he could fell it to good ac-
count; however, if I thought it convenient to give him li-
berty to offer it in my name to the two merchants, the sur-
vivors of my trustees, residing at the BrazJs, who conse-
quently knew its intrinsic value, having lived just upon the
spot, and who I was sensible were very rich, and therefore
might be the more willing to purchase it: he did not in
the least doubt, but that I mould make four or five thou-
sand pieces of eight more of it, than 1 could, if I dis-
posed of it in any other manner whatsoever.
You may be sure I could not but agree wirh this kind
and ingenuous proposal; and immediately I sent him an or-
der to offer it to them, which he accordingly did; so that
about eight months after, the (hip being in that time re-
turned, he gave me a satisfactory account, that they not
only willingly accepted the offer, but that they had also re-
mitted 33,opo pieces of eight to a correspondent of their
own at Lisbon, in order to pay for the purchase.
Hereupon, in return, 1 signed the instrument of sale, ac-
cording to form, which they had sent from Lisbon, and
returned it again to my old friend, he having sent me, for
my estate, bills of three hundred and twenty-eight tnousand
pieces of eight, reserving the payment of one hundred moi*
dores per annum, which 1 haa allowed him durir g life,
likewise sifty to his son during life also, according to my
faithful promise, which the plantation was to make good
as a rent charge.
And thus having led my reader to the knowledge of the
£rst parts of my life, so remarkable for the many peculiar
providences that attended it, Soatine in the ocean of un-
certat tv and disappointment, of adversity and prosperity,
beginning foolishly, and yet ending happily; methinks,
new that I am o.me to a safe and a pleasant haven, it is
time to cast out rav anchor, and, laying up my vessel, bid,
for a while, adieu to foreign adventures. I had no other
concerns to look after, but the care of my brother's two
sons, which, with the good widow's persuasions, obliged
me toxontinue at home seven years. One of these chil-
dren i bred up a gentleman, and the other an experienced
sailor, remarkable for his courage and bravery. Besides
tfcb, I married a virtuous young gentlewoman, of a very
good family, by whom I had two sons and one daughter.
$ut my dear and tender wife leaving this earthly stage (as
jn the second part of my life you will hear) which rent my
soul as it were asunder, ray native country became weary
and tiresome to me; and my nephew happening to come
from sea, tempted me to venture another voyage to the
East Indies, which I did in the year 1694, at which time
I visited my island, and informed myself of every thing
that happened since my departure.
One might reasonably imagine, that what I had suffered,
together with an advanced age, and the fear of losing, not
only whit 1 had gotten, bat my life also, might havechoak-
ed up all the seeds of youthful ambition and curiosity, and
put a lasting period to my wanderirg inclinations. But as
nothing but death can fully allay the active part of my life,
no less remarkable for the many various contingencies osit,
you will next perceive how I visited my little kingdom, faw
my successors the Spaniards, had an account of the usage
they met with from the Englishmen, agreeing and dis-
agreeing, uniting and separating, till at last they were sub-
jected to the Spaniards, who yet used them very honour-
ably, together with the wonderful and successful battles
over the Indians who invaded, and thought to have con-
quered the island, but were repelled by their invincible
courage and bravery, having taken eleven men and live
women prisoners, by which, at my return, I found about
twenty young children on my little kingdom. Here I staid
twenty days, left them supplies of all necessary things, as
also a carpenter and smith, and shared the island into parts,
reserving the whole property to myklf* Nor will you be
insensible, by the account es these things, of several new
adventures I have been engaged in, the battles I have
fought, the deliverances I have met with; and while, in
the surprising relation of such remarkable occurrences, I
shall describe many of God's kindest providences to me in
particular, no less conspicuous in the fame goodness, power,
and majesty of our great Creator, shown one way or other,
over the face of the earth, if .duly adverted to.
THE FURTHER ADVENTURES OP
ROBINSON CRUSOE.
Wherein are contained several strange and sur-*
prising Accounts of bis Travels, and his vioji
remarkable Transactions both by Sea and
Land; with bis wonderful Vision of the An-
gelic IVor id.
WHEN we consider the puissant so rce os Nature, ar?d
what mighty influence it has many times over the
temper of the mind, it will be no such great wonder to
think, that my powerful reason should be overcome by a
much stronger inclination. My late acquired kingdom
ran continually in my thoughts all the day, and I dreamed
of it in the night: nay, I made it the continual subject of
my talk, even to impertinence, when I was awake. I had
such vapours in my head, that I actually supposed myself
at my call le; that I not only perceived Fridays father,
the old Spaniard, and the wicked sailGrs, but that I
talked and discoursed with them about their manner os liv-
ing; that I heard the things related to me, which I found
afterwards to be too true; and that I executed my judg-*
ments with the greatest severity upon the offenders. And,
indeed, this anticipating all the pleasing joys of my life,
scarcely afforded me one pleasant hour: my dear and ten-
der wife could not but take notice of it, which drew those
affectionate speeches from her: "My dear/' said (he, " I
4t am really persuaded that some secret impulse from Hea-
"ven occasions in you a determination to fee the island
€i again; nor am I less sensible, but your being engaged
*< to me and these dear children, is the only higderance
*c of your departure. Lknow, my dear, if I were in the
*' grave, you would not long continue at home; prevent
"not your happiness on my account, whose only comfort
4i centres in you. All that I can object h, that (ach
"an hazardous undertaking is no,way consistent with a
"person of your years; but if you are resolved to go/*
added she, weeping, "only permit me to bear you com-
V pany, ajid that is all that I desire,"
G
Such endearing tenderness, graced with the most inno-
cent, and yet most powerful charms, brought me insensibly
into my right understanding; and when I considered all the
transactions of my life, and particularly my new engage-
ment; that I bad now one child already born, and my wife
big of another; and that I had no occasion to seek for
more riches, who already was blessed with sufficiency, with
much struggling I altered my resolutions at last, resolving
to apply myself to some business or other, which.might put
a period to such wandering inclinations. Hereupon I
bought a little farm in the county of Bedford, .with a re-
solution to move thither; upon this there was a pretty
convenient iiouse,s surrounded with land, very capable, of
improvement, which -suited my temper, as to planting,
managing, and cultivating. Nor was I long before 1 en-
tered upon my new settlement, having bought ploughs,
harrows, carts, waggons, horses, cows., and iheep; so that
I now led the life of a country gentleman, and as happy
in my retirement as the greatest monarch in the world.
And what made me think my happiness the greater was5
that I was in the middle state of life, which my father had
so often recommended, much resembling the felicity of a
rural retirement, which is elegantly described by the poet
in these lines:
Free from all vices, free from care,
Age has no pain, and >oath no snare.
But, in the midst of this my happiness, I was suddenly
plunged in the greatest sorrow that I could possibly endure;
for when I least expected it, my dear and tender wife was
fbreed to submit to the irresistible power of Death, leaving
this transitory life for a better. It is impossible for me to
express the beauties of her mind, or the loveliness of her
person; neither can I too much lament her loss, which my
latest breath shall record ; her influence was greater over
• me than the powers of my o*n reason, the importunities
of friends, the instructions of a father, or the melting tears
of a tender and disconsolate mother; in-a.word, she was
the spirit of all my aiFairs, and the centre of my enter-
prizes But now, since the cruel hand of Death had closed
L dear eft's eyes, I seemed in my thoughts a stranger to
the w^ld; mv privy counsellor being gone, I was li.ee a
ftip without a'pilot, that could only run before the wind.
And when I looked ground me in this busy world, one pars
labouring for bread, and the other squandering away their
estates; this put me in mind how I had lived in my little
kingdom, where both reason and religion dictated to me,
that there was something that certainly was the reason and
end of life, which was far superior to what could be hoped
for on this fide the grave. My country delights were now
as insipid and dull9 as music and science to those who have
neithir taste nor ingenuity. In short, resolving to leave
ciF house-keeping, I left my farm, and in a few months
returned to London.
But neither could that great city, (o famous for its va-
riety of entertainment, afford me any agreeable delight;
a-state of idleness I found to be true very dregs of life, and
most hurtful to body and foul. It was now the beginning
of the year 1684, at which time my nephew (who, as f
before observed had been brought xip to the sea, and ad-
vanced to be captain of a (hip) was returned from a short
voyage to Bilboa, the first he had made in that station.
He comes to me one morning, telling me, that some mer-
chants of his acquaintance had proposed to him to go a
voyage for them to the East Indies and China in the
manner of private traders; "and now, uncle," said he,
*' if you'll accompany me thither, I'll engage to las;d you
"upon your old iiland, to visit the stale of your little
*' kingdom."
Just before he came in, my thoughts were sixed to get
a patent for its possession, and then tc fill it with inhabi-
tants. AAer J had paused a while, and looked stedsastlv
on him, " What devil or spirit,*' said I, "sent you with
this unlucky errand? He started at first; but recovering
himself, when he perceived I was not offended; " Sir,"
. replied he, "what I have proposed cannot, I hope, be
iiykd unlucky, since certainly you must be desirous to
fee your little territory, where you reigned with more con-
tent than any of your brother kings in the universe.—
"Nephew," said I, "if you will leave me there, and
call for me as you come hack, I care not if I give
my consent: but he answered, that the merchants
r^vould not allow their vessel, leaden with an infinite
value, to reiurn there again, which was a month's fail
out of the way; " besides.. Sir," said he, "is I mould
miscarry, was your request granted, why then you would
be locked up as before." This, indeed carried a great
deal of reason in it; but we found out a remedy, and
G z
that was to carry a framed sloop on board, ready to be set
up in the island, by the assistance of some carpenters, which
we should carry with as, that might be fitted in a few days
to go to sea. I was not long in forming my resolution,
which overstayed my good friend the widow's persuasions,
and the natural affection I bore to my young children. I
made my will, and settled my estate in such manner, that
I was perfectly sure my poor infants would have justice
done them. The gocd widow rot only undertook to make
provision for my voyage, but also took the charge of my
domestic affairs, and to provide for my children's educa-
tion; and indeed no mother could take more care, or un-
derstood that office better; for which I lived to reward and
return her my hearty thanks.
The beginning of January, 1694-5, my nephew being
ready to fail, I and Friday went on board in the Downs on
the 8th, having, besides that sloop slready mentioned, a
very considerable cargo for my new colony. First, I had
some servants, whom I proposed to leave there, as they
should appear willing; there were two carpenters, a smith,
and a very ingenious fellow who was Jack-of-all-trades;
for he was not only a cooper by trade, but also he was
dexterous at making wheels, and hand-mills to grind corn,
likewise a good turner, and a good pot-maker. I also car-
ried a tailor, who consented to stay in my plantation, and
proved a most necessary fellow in the island. As to my
cargo, it consisted of a sufficient quantity of linen, and
English stuffs for clothing the Spaniards that I expected
to find there; as likewise gloves, hats, stioes, stockings;
together with beds, bedding, and household stuff, especi-
ally kitchen utensils, with pots, kettles, pewter, brass, &c.
also nails, tools of all forts, staples, hooks, hinges, and all
other things necessary; all which, I think, cost me about
three hundred pounds. Ncr.was this ail: for I carried
an hundred spare arms, muskets and fusees, besides some
pistols, a considerable quantity of several sorts of shot, two
brass cannon, besides swords, cutlasses, and the iron part
of some pikes and halberts. I made my nephew take with
us two small quarter-deck gims, more than he had occa-
sion for in his snip, to leave behind, if there, was a neces-
sity ; so that we might build a fort there, and man it against
all opposers whatsoever.
Well, we put cut to sea; and though I can't fay this
voyage was so unpresperous as my others had been, ye;
contrary winds drove us so far northward, that we were
obliged to put in at Galway in Ireland, where we lay wind-
bound two and twenty days. Here indeed our provisions
were very cheap, and we added to our ship's stores by
taking several live hogs, two cows and calves, which
I then resolved to put cm shore in my island, if our necef-
suies did not call for them. On the 5th of February we
failed from Ireland, with a very fair gale, which lasted for
some days; and I think it was about the 20th of the fame
month, late in the evening, when the mate informed us,
that he saw a flash of fire, and heard a gun fired: and
when he was speaking, a boy came in and told us, that
the boatswain had heisid another. Upon which we all ran
to the quarter-deck, from whence, in a few moments, we
perceived a terrible fire at a distance. We had immedi-
ately recourse to our reckonings, in which we were all of
opinion, that there could b^ no land that way, it appearing
to be at N. N. W. Hereupon we concluded that some ship
had taken fire at sea, and that it could not be far off, by
the report of the guns which we had heard. We made up
directly to it, and in half an hour's time, the wind being
fair, we could plainly perceive a great ship on fire, in the
middle of the sea. Touched with this unhappy disaster,
and considering my former circumstances, when the Por-
tuguese Capcain took me up, I immediately ordered five
guns to be fired, thac the poor creatures, not seeing us, it
being da:k, (though we could perceive their flame) might
be sensible there was deliverance at hand, aud consequent-
ly might endeavour to save themselves in their boat. Nor
was it long before the (Lip blew up in the air, and the fire
was extinguished in the ocean. But supposing them all to
be in their boats, we hung out our lanterns, and kept fir-
ing till eight o'clock in th*; morning; when, with our per-
spectives, we beheld two boars full of people, making to-
wards us, tho* the tide was against them; then spreading
out our ancient, and hanging out a waft, as a signal fur
them to come on board, in half an hour's time, we came
up to them, and took them all in, there being no less than
sixty-four men, women, and children. It was a French
merchant (hip of three hundred tons, homeward-bound
from Quebec in the river of Canada. The master in-
formed me how, by the negligence of the steersman, the
Reeiage was set on fire: that, at his outcry for help, the
£re was, as we thought totally extinguished; but, that
G 3
some spa'fcs getting between the timber, and within tHe
ceiling, it proceeded into the hold, where there was no re-
sisting it; and then they got into their boats, as creatures
in the last extremity, with what provision they had, toge-
ther with cars, fails, and a compass, intending to go back
to Newfoundland, the wind blowing at S.E^ and by E.
though there were several chances against them, as storms
t© overset and founder them, rains and colds to benumb
and perish their limbs, and contrary winds to keep them
back and starve them; but, said he, in this our great
distress, we heard the welcome report of your guns, when
with unspeakable joy, taking down our masts and fails, we
were resolved to lie by till morning; but perceiving your
light, we set cur oars at work, to keep our boat a head,
the sooner to attain your stiip, the happy instrument of our
deliverance.
Indeed no one can express the joy of these poor crea-
tures en this occasion; fear and grief are easily set forth;
sighs and tears, with a few motions of the hards and head,
are all the demonstrations of these passions; but an excess
of joy, carries in it a thousand extravagancies; especially,
I think, among the French, whose temper is allowed to
be more volatile, passionate, sprightly, and gay, than that
of other nations. Some were weeping, tearing themselves
in the greatest agonies of sorrow, and running stark mad
about the stiip, while the rest were stamping with their feet,
wringing their hands, singing, laughing, swooning away,
vomiting, fainting, with a few returning hearty thanks to
the Almighty, and crossing themselves. I think, if I am
not mistaken, our surgeon was obliged to let thirty of them
blood. But among the passengers, there were two priests,
the one an old, and the other a young man; but what
amazed me more was, that the oldest was in the worst
plight; for no sooner did he perceive himself freed from
danger, but he dropt down as it were without life, and
.to every one's appearance quite dead; but the surgeon
chasing and rubbing his arm, opened a vein, which at first
dropped, and then flowing more freely, the old man began
to open his eyes, and in a quarter of an hour was well
again. But soon remembering this happy change, the joy
of which whirled his blood about faster than the vessels
could convey it, he became so severisn, as made him more
Ut for bedlam than any other place; but the surgeon giv~
ing him a sleepy dose, be was perfectly composed the next
morning.
Remarkable, indeed, was the behaviour of the young
piiest. At his entrance on board the ship, he fell on his
face in the most humble prostration to the Almighty. I
thought, indeed, he had fallen into a swoon, and so ran to
help him up; but he modestly told me, he was returning
his thanks to the Almighty, desiring me to leave him a
few moments, and that, next to his Creator, he would re-
turn me thanks alfa. And indeed he did so about three
minutes after, with great seriousness, and affection, while
the tears stood in his eyes, which convinced me of the
gratitude of hh foul. Nor did he less show his piety and
wisdom, in applying himself to his country people, and
labouring to compose them, by the most powerful reasons,
argument:, and persuasions. And when, indeed, these
peop'e had taken their night's repose, in such lodgings as
our (hip would allow, we found nothing but the belt of
manners, and the most civil acknowledgments, for which
the French are eminently remarkable. The next day the
Captain and one of the priests desired to speak with me
and my nephew the commander. They told us, that they
had saved some money and valuable things out of the
ruined vessel, which was at our service; only that they de-
sired to be set on shore some where in our way. At the
first my nephew was for accepting the money; but I
(who knew how hard my cafe would have been, had the
Portuguese Captain served me so) persuaded him to the
contrary; and therefore told them, that as we had don*
nothing but what we were obliged to do, by nature and
humanity, and what we ourselves might expect from others
in such calamity; so we took them up to save them, not
to plunder them, or leave them naked upon the land, to
perish for want of subsistence, and therefore would not'
accept their money: but as to landing them, that was a
great difficulty; for being bound to the East Indies, it
was impossible wilfully to change our vovage upon their
particular account, nor could my nephew'(who was under
charter party to pursue it by way of Brazil) answer it to
the freighters. AU that we could do, was to put ourselves
in the way of meeting some ships homeward bound from
the West Indies, that, if possible, they might get a pas-
sage to France or England. Indeed, they were ver*
thankful sjr our first kindness; but were under great ccr.»~
G4
cern, especially the passengers, at their being Carried to the
East Indies. They begged, therefore, I would keep oa
the banks of Newfoundland, where probably they might
meet with some ship, or sloop, to carry them to Canada,
whence they came. -As this was but a reasonable request,
I was inclined to grant it, since it was no breach of charter-
party, and that the laws of God and nature obliged us to
do what good we could to our feliow-creatures; and be-
ades the danger we ourselves sliould be in for want of pro-
visions : so we consented to carry them to Newfoundland,
if wind and weather wouid permit; if not, that we fhouli
carry them to Martinico in the West Indies. But, as it
happened, in a week's time \?e made the banks of New-
foundland, where the French people hired a bark to carry
them to France. But the young priest being desirous to-
go to the East Indies, I readily agreed to it, because I
liked his conversation, and two or three of the French sai~
Icj s also entered themselves en board cur ship.
New, directing our course for the West Indies, steering
S. and S. by E. about twenty days, with little wind* ano-
ther adventure happened to exercise oar humanity* In the
latitude of 27 degrees, 5 minutes north, the 19th of March
1694-5, we perceived a fail, (our course S. E. and by S.)'.
which bore upon us, and then she appeared to be a large
vessel, having lost her main top-mast and boltsprit $. when
firing a gun as a signal of distress, wind N. N. W. we sooa
came to speak with her. She was a ship from Bristol,,
bound home from Barbadoes, oa: of which road m-e had
been forced in a hurricane to the westward, in which they
lost their masts.
They told us, their expectations were to fee the Bahama
islands, but were driven away by a stro«g wind at N. N.W.
and having no fails to work the ship with, but the main-
course, and a kind of a square fail upon a jury fore-mast,
because they could not come near the land, were endea-
vouring to stand for the Canaries: nay, what was worse,
besides all their fatigue, they were almost starved for want
of provision, having ate nothing for eleven days; all that
they had aboard was sugar, a barrel of fresh water, and
seven casks of rum. in this ship were passengers, a youth,
his mother, and a maid-servant, who were in a most de-
plorable ccnJiticn for want of food. If I had not gone
on board their strip, the knowledge of tneir m sery had
been concealed from me, and they would have ineviiably
periihed; though, indeed, their second mate who was
Captain, by reason the true Captain was not on board
when the hurricane happened, had before informed me
that there were such persons on board, whom he supposed
to be dead, being afraid to inquire after them, because he.
had nothing to give them for relief. Hereupon we re-
solved to let them have what we could spare, ordering the
mate to bring some of his men en board us, which he did
accordingly; as he and they looked like skeletons, when
meat was set before them, I ordered them to eat spar;nglyc
But, however, they soon fell sick; which obliged the sur-
geon to mix something in their broth, which was to be to
them both food *nd physic. When they were fed,.we or-
dered our mate to carry them a sack of bread, and four or
five pieces of beef; but the surgeon charged them to see
it boiled, and to keep a guard on the cook-room, to pre-
vent the men from eating it raw, and consequently killing
themselves with what was designed for their relief. But,
particularly, I desired the mate to see what condition the
poor pasiVngers were in, and the surgeon gave him a pitcher
of the same broth which, he had prepared for the men.
And being curious to fee this scene of misery myself, I
took the Captain (as we called the mate of the ship) in
cur own boat, and sailed aftrr them*
Here wava sad fight indeed! scarce were the victuals
half boiled in the pot, but they were ready to break open
the cook-room door. lo stay their stomachs the mate
ga,ve them biscuits, which were dipped in and softened with
the liquor of the meat, which they call bruise; telling
them, it was for their own safety, that he was obliged to
give them but a little at a time; and so feeding them gra-
dually, their bellies were c mfortablv filled, and the men
did very well again. But-, when tney came to the poor
gentlewoman in *he cabin, who for several days had con*
tinued withou; food, giving what (he had to her fun, they
found her as it were in the arm»of deatn. Sneuas mting
upon the floor of the deck, with her ba^k.'ip against the
iidesa between two chairs, which were lashed fast, and
her head shrank between hi r (boulders, like a senseless
corpse. Nothing was wanting ia my mate to revive and
encourage ner; opening her lips, and putting some broth
into her mouth with a spoon. But not having strength
to speak, she lifted up her head with much dilBculty, inti-
matiag that it was jjow too late I u the fame time pointing
G5
to the youth her son, as though she desired him to do what
he could to save the lad; and, in a little time after, she
died.
The youth, indeed, was not so far gone, yet lay stretch-
ed out en a cabin bed, like one that had scarce any life.
In his mouth was a piece of an old glove, the rest of which
he had ate up. At first he vomited what the mate had
given him; but at length began sensibly to revive, though
in the greatest concern for the death os his tender mother.
As to the poor maid, {he lay by her mistress, like one
in the last pangs of death: her limbs were distorted, one
of her hands was clasped round the frame of a chair, which
(he grasped so hard, that it was with some difficulty we se-
parated her from it; her other arm lay o\>er her head, and
her feet lay both together, set fast against the frame of the
cabin table; not only being starved with hunger, but over-
come with grief at the loss of her mistress, whom she loved
most tenderly. It was a great while before the sergeon
could bring her to life, and a much longer time before she
came to her senses.
After we had sailed with them some days, we sent them
five barrels of beef, one of pork, two hogsheads of biscuit.
with peas, flour, and other things; taking three casks of
sugar, some rum, and some pieces of eight as piyment,
we left them, but took the youth and maid with us, with
all their goods. The lad was about seventeen years old,
very handsome, modest, sensible, and well-bred, but
mightily concerned for the loss of his honoured mother,
having lost his father at Barbadoes but a few months be-
fore. He befeeched the surgeon to intercede with me to
take him out of the ship; for that the sailors, not sparing
a small sustenance, had starved his mother. But hunger
has no bounds, no right, and consequently is incapable of
any companion. When the surgeon told him, our voyage
might put him in bad circumstances, and farther from his
friends, he said he did not care, if he was delivered from
that terrible crew; that as the Captain (meaning me) had
saved him from death, so he was sure he would do him no
harm; and, as for the maid, when she was restored to her
fenses, (he would be no less thankful, let us carry them
where we would. And indeed the surgeon so represented
their case to me, that I consented, ~nd took them on
board with ail their goods, except eleven hogsheads of
sugar; but the youth having a bill of lading, I made the
commander oblige himself to deliver a letter and the de-
ceased widow's goods to Mr. Rogers, a merchant in Bris-
tol; but I believe the (hip was lost at sea, for we never
could hear what became of her afterwards We were
now in the latitude igdeg 32 mm. having as yet a tole-
rable good voyage. But, pissing by several little inci-
dents relating to wind and weather, I shall relate what is
most remarkable concerning my little kingdom, to which I
was then drawing near. I had great difficulty in finding it,
for as I came to, and went from it before, on the south
and east side of the island, as coming from the Brazils, so
now approaching between the main and the island, not
having any chart for the coast, nor land mark, it obliged
us to go on shore on several islands in the mouth of the ri-
ver Oroonoko, but to no purpose. Thus 1 perceived, that
what I thought was a continent before, was no such tiling,
but a long island, or rather a ridge of sands. On one of
these islands I found some Spaniards, but they belonged to
the <sle de Trinidad, who came hither in a sloop to make
salt, and try to find some pearl muscles. But at length I
came fair on the south-fide of my island, and then I pre-
sently knew the countenance of rm little kingdom: so we
brought the ship safe to an anchor, broadside within the
creek, where stood my ancient and venerable castle.
No sooner did 1 see the place, but calling for Friday, I
asked him where he was? But when he looked a little, he
clapped his hands, crying, "C- joy, O there, O yes, O
there !" pointing to our old abode, and then fell a dmcing
and capering as if he was mad, and 1 had much ado to .keep
him from jumping into the sea, to swim ashore. "Friday,"
sa:d I, *« what do you think, shall we go to see your'fa-
ther?" At the mentioning his father'/ name, the poor
affectionate creature fell a weeping: te No, no/* fays he,
"me fee him no more, never fee poor father more! he
long ago die, die long ago; he much old man." «« You
don't know that," said I, " but (hall we see any body else i"
He looks about, and pointing to the hill above my house,
cries out, "We fee, we fee there much men and there;"
which, though I could not perceive them with my per-
spective glass, was true, by what the men themselves tcld
me the next day. "s
When the English ancient was spread,' and three gnns
fired, as a signal of friendship* we perceived a smoke rise
G6
from the creek; upon which I ordered the boat out, ta-
lcing Friday with me, and hanging cut 2 white £ag of
truce, I went on shore, accompanied also by the young
friar, to whom I had related the history of the first part of
my life; besides, we had sixteen men well armed, in cafe
we had met with any opposition
After ue had rowed directly into the creek, the first man
J fixed my eye upon was the Spaniard, whose life 1 had
saved, and whose face I perfectly well knew, i ordered
them all to stay in the boat for a while; but Friday, per-
ceiving his father at a distance, would have jumped into the
sea, had they not let the boat go. No sooner was he on
ihore, but he flew like a swift arrow out of a bow to em-
brace his aged father. Certainly it would melt a man of
the firmest resolution into the softest tears, to fee with what
uncommon transports of joy he fakted him; he first k:sied
him, then stroked his- face, took him in his arms, laid him
under a shady tree, fat down by him, then looked as ear-
xiestly at him as one could do at a picture, for a quarter of
an hour together. Alter this he would lie upon the
ground, stroke his legs and kiss them, then get up and stare
at him, as though he was bewitched; but the next day one
could not forbear laughter to fee his behaviour, for he
would walk several hour* vvith his father alorg the snore*
leading him by the hand, as tho' he was a lady ; while, every
r>ow sad then, he would run to the boat to get something
for him, as a lump of rugar, dram, biscuit, or something
or other that was good. His frolics ran in another channel
in the afternoon; when he set old Fridav en the ground,
he would dance round him, making comical postures and
gestures^ and all this while would be telling him one story
or another of his travels and adventures.
It was on the 10th of April, enm 16/5, that I set my
scot upon the island a second t me. When my faithful
Spaniard, accompanied by one more, appr ached the boat,
he little knew who I was, till I discovered myself to him.
*' Seignior,'* said 1, in Portuguese,««don*t you know me?"
He spoke never a word, but giving his musket to his attend-
ant, extended his arms, and saying something in Spanish
that I did not then understand, he came forward and em-
braced me, saying, he was inexcusable not to know his
deliverer \ who, like an angel sent from heaven, had save4
his life. He then beckoned to the man to call out his
companions, a&ing roe if I would walk to my own habi-
tation, and take possession, where I should find some mean
improvements; hut indeed they were extraordinary ones;
for the> had planted so many trees so close to ether, that
the p?ace was iike a labyrinth, which none could find out
except themselves, who knew its intricate windings. I
asked him the meaning os al these fortifications r he told
me he would give a large account or what had passed since
my departure till this time, and now he had subdued some
English, who thought to be their murderers, hoping I
would not be displeased, since rectffity compelled them to
it. As 1 knew they we»e wicked villains, so I told nim,
that I was not only far from finding fault with it, but was
rather heartily glad that they had subdued them. While
we were thus talking, the man whom he fen: returned, ac-
companied by eleven more, but in such habits, that it was
impossible to tell what rations they were of. He first turned
to me, and pointing to them, «' These, Sir," said he, '« are
some of the gentlemen who o*e their lives to your good-
ness;" then turning to them, and pointing to me, he
made them sensible who I was; and then indted they sa-
luted me one by one, not as ordinary men, but as though
they had been ambassadors or noblemen, and I a triumph-
ant conqueror; for their behaviour not only agreed with
a manlike, majestic gravity, but at the fame time was so
obliging and courteous, as made them agreeable to the
last degree.
Before 1 relate the history of the transactions of my
kingdom, as 1 had it from the Spaniard's own mouth, £
must here insert what I omitted in my former relation. The
matter is this: Just before we weighed anchor and set sail,
there happened a quarrel on bo.rd the ship, which had
like to have occasioned a second mutiny, till such time as
the courageous Captain, taking two of the most refractory
prisoners, laid them in irons, threatening, as they were con-
cerned in the former disorders, to have them hanged in
England for running away wi h the ship. This frightened
some os the rest, as thinking the Captain wouM serve them
in the same manner, thougn he seemed to give them good
words for the present. But the mate having intelligence
of this, made me acquainted with their fears; so that, to
make them more easy, and ourselves more safe from their
conspiracies, I was obliged to go down, and pass my ho-
nour's word for it, that upon their good behaviour, all
$bat was past should be forgiven; in testimony of which,
I ordered the two men's irons to be taken oft, and them-
selves forgiven. But as this had brought us to an anchor
that night, in which there was a calm; the two men that
had been in irons stole each of them a musket, and some
ether weapons, and taking the ship's pinnace, not yet hauled
up, ran away to their brother rogues. The next morning
we sent the long-boat with men to pursue them, but all in
vain; the mate, in revenge, would nave demolished my
little castle, burnt its furniture, and destroyed their plan-
tations, but having no orders for it, he did not put it in
execution. And thus there were five Englishmen in the
island, which caused great differences, as my faithful
Spaniard gave me a perfect account of, in the following
manner;
"You cannot, Sir, but remember the embassy you sent
me about, and what a disappointment we met with, by your
absence, at our return. There is but iittle variety in the
relation of all our voyage, being blessed with cairn wea-
ther, and a smooth sea. Great indeed was the joy of my
countrymen to fee me aiive having acted as the principal
man on board, the captain of the shipwrecked vessel dying
before; nor was their surprise less, as knowing I wab taken
prisoner by the savages of another nation, they had thought
roe long since entombed in their monstrous bowels. But
when I showed them the arms, ammunition, and provi-
sions I had brought for them, they looked upon me as a se-
cond Joseph advanced in Pharaoh's court, and immedi-
ately prepared to come along with me Indeed they were
obliged to trespass upon their friendly savaoes, bv borrow-
ing two of their canoes, under a pretext for fishing; and
they came away the next morning, but without any pro-
visions of their own, except a few roots, which served
them instead of bread. After three weeks absence we ar-
rived at our habitation. Here we met with three English
sailors, who, I confess, gave us provisions, and that letter
of direction you hid left for us, which informed us how to
bring up tame goats, plant corn, cure grapes, make pots,
and, in short, every thing that was necessary for our use.
As, in particular, I knew your method best, so taking
Friday's father to assist me, we managed all the affairs;
nor were the rest of the Spaniards wanting in their kind
offices, dressing food for the Englishmen, who did nothing
but ramble and divert themselves in the woods, either (hoot-
ing parrots, or catching tortoises. But we had not been
long ashore, before we were informed of two more Eng-
lishmen, naturally turned out of their common place of
residence, by the three others above m-entioned ; this made
my Spaniards and me (whom they now looked upon as
their governor in your absence) endeavour to persuade
them to take them in* that we might be as one family;
but all our intreaties were in vain, so that the poor fellows
finding nothing to be done without industry, pitched their
tents on the north side of the island, a little inclining to the
west, for fear of savages. Here they built two huts, one
to lodge, and the other to lay their stores in; for my good
natured Spaniards giving them some seeds, they dug and
planted as I had done, and began to live prettily. But
while they were thus comfortably going on, trie three un-
natural brutes, their countrymen, in a mere bullying hu-
mour, insulted them, by saying, the governor (meaning
you) had given them a pofieffion of the island, and d-mn
Jem they should build no houses upon their ground, with-
out paying rent. The two honest men (for so let me now
distinguish them) thought their three countrymen only jest-
ed, and one of them invited them in, to see their fine ha-
bitations; while the other facetiously told them, that since
they built tenements with great improvements, they should,
according to the custom of lords, give them a longer
lease; at the same time desiring them to fetch a scrivener
to draw the writings. One of these wretches swearing he
should pay for the jest, snatches up a sire brand, and
clapping it to the outside of their hut, very fairly set it on
fire, which would soon have consumed it, had not the ho-
. nest man thrust him away, and trod it out with his feet.
Hereupon the fellow returns with his pole, with which he
would have ended his days, had not the poor man avoided
the blow, when fetching his musket, he knocked down the
villain that began the quarrel. The other two coming to
assist their fellow, obliged the honest man to take his
musket also, and both of them presenting their pieces, bid
the villains stand off; and if they did not lay down their
arms, death should decide the dispute one way or other.
This brought them to a parley, in whicn they agreed to
take their wounded man and be gone; but they were in
the wrong that they did not disarm them when they had
the power, and then make their complaint to me and my
Spaniards for justice, which might have prevented their
farther designs against them. And indeed so many tref-
passes did they afterwards commit, by treading down their
corn, shooting: their young kids and goats, and plaguing,
them night and day, that they resolved to come to my
castle, challenge all the three, and decide their right by-
one plain battle, while the Spaniards stood by to fee fdir
play. One day it happened* that t*o of my Spaniards
(one of whom understood English) being in the woods,
were met by one of the h west men, who complained how
barbarous their countrymen had been in destroying their
corn, killing their milk-goat and three kids, which de-
prived them of their subsistence; and that if we did not
grant them relief, they must be inevitably starved, and so
they parted; but when my Spaniards came home at night*
and supper being on the table, one of them began to re-
prehend the Englishmen, but in a very mannerly way 5
which they resenting, replied, " What business had their
countrymen in that place without leave, when it was none
of their ground?" ** Why," said my S aniard, calmly,
*' Inglissr they must not starve:" but they replied, «« Let
them starve arid be damn'd, they mould neither plant nor
build; and damn jhem, they should be their servants, and
work for them, for the istand was theirs, and they would
burn all the huts they should find in the island." ,c By
this rule," said my Spaniard, smiling, \€ We shall be
your servants too." "Aye, by G-d, and so you shall,'3 *
replied the impudent rascal. Upon which, starting up,
Will Atkins cries,f( Come, Jack, let's have t'other bruih
with them; who dare to build in our dominions?"
Thus leaving us something heated with just paffion, away
they trooped, every man having a gun, pistol, and swords
muttering some threatening words, that we could then but
imperfectly understand. That night they designed to mur-
der their two companions, and Ilcpt till midnight in the
bower, thinking to fall upon them in their sleep 5 nor were
the honest men less thoughtful concerning them; for at this
juncture they were coming to find them out, but in a much
fairer way. As soon as the villains came to the huts, and
found no body there, they concluded that I and my Spa-
niard had given them notice, and therefore (wore to be
revenged on us. Then they demolished the poor men's
habitations; not by fire, as they attempted before, but
pulled down their houses, limb from limb, not leaving stick
nor stone on the ground where they stood, broke their
household stuff in pieces, tore up their trees, spoiled their
inclosures, and, in short, quite ruined them of every thing
they had. Had these people met together, no aoubt but
there would have bcerr a bloody battle; but Provider.ee
ordered it for the better; forjust as the three were got to-
gether the two were at our caff le; and whenr they if ft us,
the three came back againy butin ^reat rage,. icof&ngly
telling uc what they had dene; when one taking held of a
Spaniard's hat, twirls it round, saying, *e And)ou Seignior
jack Spaniard, shall have the same sauce, if you don't
mend your manners/' My Spaniard, a grave but coura-
geous man, knocked him down with one blow of his rist ;,
at which another villain fired his pistol, and narrowly missed
his body, but wounded him a litth- in the ear Hereat
enraged, the Spaniard takes up the fellow's musket whom
he had knocked down, and would have lhot him, if I and
the rest had not come out,,and taken their arms from every
one of them.
c* These Englishmen perceiving they had made all of us
their enemies, began to cool; but notwithstanding their
better words, the Spaniards would not return them their
arms again, telling them, they would do them no manner
of harm, if they would live peaceably; but if they offered
any injury to the plantation or castie, they would {hoot
them as they would do ravenous beasts. This made them
so mad, that they went away raging like su ies of hell.
They were no sooner gone, but in came the two honest:
men, fired with the justelt rage, if such can be, having
been ruined as aforefaidr And indeed it was very hard,
that nineteen of us should be bullied by three villains, con-
tinually offending with impunity,
*' It was a great while, Sir, before we could persuade the
two Englishmen from pursuing, and undoubtedly killing
them with iheir fire-arms; but we promised them justice
ihould be done them, and, in the mean time, they should
reside with us in cur habitation. Jn about five days after,
these three vagrants, almost starved with hunger* drew near
our grove, and perceiving me, the governor, and two others
walking by the fide of the creek, they very submissively
desired to be received into the family again. We told
them of their great incivility to us, and of their unnatural
barbarity to their countrymen; but yet we would see what
the rest agreed to, and in half an hour's time would bring
them word. After some debate, we called them in, where
their two countrymen laid a heavy charge against them,
for not only ruining, but designing to murder them, whlcfi
they could not deny. But here I was forced to interpose
as a mediator, by obliging the two Englishmen not to hurt
them, being naked and unarmed, and that the other three
should make them restitution, by building their two huts,
end fencing their ground in the fame manner as it was be-
fore. Well, being in a miserable condition, they submit-
ted to this at present, and lived some .time regularly enough,
except as to the working part, which they did not care for5
but the Spaniards would-have dispensed with that, frad they
continued easy and quiet. Their arms being given them
again, they scarce had them a week when they became as
troublesome as ever ; but an accident happening soon after,
obliged us to lay aside private resentments, and look to our
common preservation.
*'- One night, Sir, [ went to bed, perfectly well in health,
and yet by no means could I compose myself to sleep;
upon which, being very uneasy, I got up and looked out^
but it being dark, I could perceive nothing but the trees
around the castle. I went to bed again, but it was all one,
1 could not sleep; when one of my Spaniards, hearing me
walk abcut, asked who it was up f I answered, " It is I."
When I toid him the occasion,** Sir/' seid be," such things
are not to be slighted ; for certainly there is some mischief
plotting against us.J> " Where are the Englishmen r" said I.
He answered, "In their huts; for they lay separate from
us, Sir, since the last mutiny. "Well," said I, "some
kind spirit gives this information for advantage. Come,
let us go abroad, and fee if ^ny thing offers to justify our
fears." Upon which I and some of my Spaniards wei*t
up the mountain,not by the ladder, but thro-ogh the grove,
and then we were struck with a panic fear on seeing a
light, as though it were a sire, at ^ very little distance,
and hearing the voices of several men. Hereupon we re-
treated immediately, and railed the rest of our forces, and
made them sensible of the impending danger; but with all
my authority, 1 could not make them stay where they were,
so earnest were thev to see how things went. Indeed the
darkness of the nigiit ga^e them opportunity enough to
view them by the light of the fire undiscovered* As they
were in different parties, and straggling over the shore, we
were much afmd that thev should find out our habitations,
and destroy our flocks of goats; to prevent which, we sent
immediately an Englishman and two Spaniards to drive
the goats into the valley where the cave lay; or, if there
was occasion, into the cave itself: As to ourselves, resum-
ing our native courage and prudent conduct, had we not
been divided, we durst venture to attack an hundred os
them; but before it was very light, we resolved to send out
Friday's father as a spy, who* immediately stripping him-
self naked, gets among them undiscovered, and in two
hours time-bungs word, that they were two parties of two
different nations, who lately having a bloody battle with
one another, happened to land by mere chance in the fame
island, to devour their miserable prisoners; that they were
entirely ignorant of any person's inhabiting here; but ra-
ther being filled with rage and fury against one another,
he believed, that as soon as day light appeared, there would
be a terrible engagement. Old Friday had scarce ended
his relation, when we heard an uncommon noise, and per-
ceived that there was a horrid engagement between the two
armies.-
"Such was the curiosity of our party, especially the
Englishmen, that they would not lie close, tho* Old Fri-
day told them their safety depended upon it; and that if
we had patience, we mould behold the savage 4;ill one ano-
ther. However, they used some caution, by going farther
into the woods, and placing themselves in a convenient
place to behold the battle.
-" Never could there be a more bloody engagement, or
men of more invincible spirits and prudent conduct, ac-
cording to their manner and way of fighting, it lasted
near two hours, till the party which was nearest our castle
began to decline, and at last to fly from their conquerors.
We were undoubtedly put into a great consternation on this
account, lest they should run into our grove, and confer
quently bring us into the like danger. Hereupon we re-
solved to kill the first that came, to prevent discovery, and
that too with our swords, and the butt end of cur muskets,
for fear the report of our guns should be heard.
*c And so indeed, as we thought, it happened; for three
of the vanquished army cresting the creek, ran directly to
the place, as to a thick wood for shelter; nor was it lung
fcefore our scout gave us notice- of it; as also, that the
victors did not think fit to pursue them. Upon this I
would not suffer them to be stain, but had them surprised
...and taken by our party; afterwards they proved very
good servants to us, being stout young creaturesr and able
to do a great deal of uork. The remainder of the con-
quered savages sted to thor canoes, and put out into the
ocean,, while the conqueror*, joining together, shouted by
way of triumph, and about three in the afternoon they also
en barked for their own nation. Thus we were freed at
once from these savages and our.fears, not perceiving any
of these creatures for some considerable time after. We
found two and thirty men dead in the field of battle; seme
were slain with lor:g amws, which we found sticking in
their bodies; and the rest were killed with great unwieldy
wooden fwcids, which denoted their vast strength, and of
which we found seventeen, besides bows and arrows: but
we could not find one wounded creature among them alive ;.
for they either kill their euemits quite, or carry those
wounded away with them*
0 This teirihle sight tamed the Englishmen for some
time, considering how unfortunate they might have been had
they fallen into their hands, who would not only kill them
as enemies, but also for food, as we do cattle; and indeed
so much did this nauseate their stomachs, that it not only
made them very sick, but more tractable to the common
necessary L^inefs of the whole society, planting, sowing,
and reaping, wkh the greatest signs of amity and friendship;
so, that being now all good friends, we began to consider
of circumstances in general ; and the first thing we thought
of was, whether, as we perceived the savages haunted that
side of the island, and there being more retired parts of it,
and yet as well suited to our manner of living, and equally
to our advantage, we ought not rather to move our place
of residence, and plant it in a much safer place, both for
the security of our corn and cattle.
'• Aster a long debate on this head, it was resolved, or^
rather voted, nemine comrutUcente, not to remove our an,cient
castle, and that for this very good reason, that some time
or other we expected to hear from our supreme governor,
(meaning you, Sir) whose messengers not sin ding us-there,
might think the place demolished, and all his subjects de-~
flroyed by the savages..
"As to the-next concern relating to our corn and cattle,
we consented to have them removed to the valley where
the cave was, that being most proper and sufneient for both.
But yet, when we considered farther, we altered one part
of cur resolution, which was to remove part of our cattle
thither and plant only part of our corn there; so that in
case one part was destroyed, the other might be preserved.
-Another resolution we took, which really had a great deal
cs prudence in it; and that was, in not trusting the three
savages whom we had taken prisoners, with any knowledge
of the plantations we had made in the valley, of what nuro-
ker of cattle we had there,, much less of the cave, wherein
we kept several arms, and t*;o barrels of powder you left
for us at your departure from this island. But though we
could not change our habitation, we resolved to make it
more fortified and more secret. To this end, Sir, as you
planted trees at some distance before the entrance of your
palace; so we, imitating your example, planted and rilled
up the whole space of ground, even to the banks of the
creek, nay, into the very ooze where the tide flowed, not
leaving a place for landing; and among those I had plant-
ed, they had intermingled so many short ones, all of which
growing wonderfully fast and thick, a little dog could
scarcely find a passage through them. Nor was this suffi-
cient, as we thought, for we did the fame to all the ground,
on the right and left hand of us, even to the top of the hill,
without so much as leaving a passage for ourselves, except
by the ladder; which being taken down, nothing but what
had wings or witchcraft could pretend to come near us.
And indeed this was exceedingly well contrived, especially
to serve that occasion, for which we afterwards found it
necessary.
c* Thus we lived two years in a happy retirement, hav-
ing, all this time, not one visit from the savages. Indeed
one morning we had an alarm, which put us in some amaze-
ment; for a few of my Spaniards heing out very early,
perceived no less than twenty canoes, as it were coming
on shore: upon which returning home,with great precipi-
tation, they gave us the alarm, which obliged us 10 keep
at home all that day and the next, going out only in the
night-time to make our observations; but, as good luck
would have it, they were upon another design, and did not
/land that time upon the island.
But now there happened another quarrel between the
three wicked Englishmen, and some of my Spaniards.-*—
The occasion was this: - One of them being enraged at
one of the savages, whom he had taken prisoner, for not
being able to comprehend something whickhe was mowing
Jiim, snatched up 4 hatchet ia a great imy not to correct,
but to kill him; yet missing his head, gave him such a
barbarous cut in the moulder, that he had like to have
struck off his arm; at which one of my good-natured Spa-
niards interposing between the Englishman and the savage*
beseeched the former not to murder the poor creature; bu£
this kindness had like to have coil the Spaniard Jiis life,
for the Englishman struck at him in the fame manner 5
which he nimbly and wifely avoiding, returned suddenly
upon him with his shovel, (being all at work about their
corn land) and very fairly knocked the brutish creature
down. Hereupon, another Englishman coming to his fel-
low's assistance^ laid the good Spaniard on the earth; when
immediately two others coming to his relief, were attacked
by the third Engiimman, armed with an oldrutlafs, who
wounded them both. This uproar soon reached our ears,
when we rushing out upon them, took the three English-
men prisoners, and then our next question was, what should
be done to such mutinous and impudent fellows, so furious,
desperate, and idle, that they were mischievous to the
highest degree and consequently not safe for the society to
let them live among them.
"Now, Sir, as I was governor in your absence, so I also
took the authority-of a judge; and, having them brought
before me, I told them, that if they had been of my
country, I would have hanged every-mother's son of them;
but, since it was an Englishman, (meaning you, kind Sir,)
to whom we were indebted for our preservation and deli-
verance, I would, in gratitude,, use them with all possible
mildness; but9 at the fame time, leave them to the judg-
ment of the other two Englishmen, who, I hoped, forget-
ting their resentments, would deal impartially by them.
** Hereupon one of his countrymen stood up: «' Sir/*
said he, "leave it not for us, for you may be sensible w^
have reason to sentence them to the gallows: besides, Sir,
this fellow, Will Atkins, and the two others, proposed to
us, that we might murder you all in your sleep, which we
could not consent to: but knowing their inability, and
your vigilance^ we did not think sit to discover it before
now."
<r How, Seignior,5' said I,<( do you hear what is alleged
against you r What can you fay to justify so horrid an
action, as to murder us in cold blood?" So far, Sir, was
the wretch from denying it, that he swore, d-mn him but
>e would do it still. "But what have we done to yoe^
Seignior Atkins," said I, ** or what will you gain by
killing us? What (hall we do to prevent you? Must we
kill you, or you kill us .? Why wilt you, Seignior Atkins,5*
scid 1, smiling, " put us to such an unhappy dilemma,
such a fatal necessty?" But so great a rage did my scof-
fing and yet severe jest, put him into, that he was going
to-fly at me, and undoubtedly had attempted to kill me if
he had been possessed of weapons, and had not been pre-
v*ntcd by three Spaniards. This unparalleled and vil-
lainous carriage, made us seriously consider what was to be
done. The two Englishmen and the Spaniard, who had
saved the poor Indian's rtt&, mightily petitioned me to
hang one of them, for an example to .the others, which
should be him that had twice attempted to .commit murder
with his hatchet, it being at that time thought impossible
the poor stave should recover. .. But they could never gain
my consent to put him to death, for the reasons above men-
tioned, since it was an Englishman (even yourself) who was
my deliverer; &fcd as merciful counsels are most prevailing
when earnestly pressed, so 1 got them ib be os the same
opinion as to clemency. But to-prevent them doing us
any farther mischief, we all agreed, that they stiould have
no weapons, as sword, gun, powder, or {hot, but be expel-
led from the society, to live as they pleased by themselres;
that neither the two Englimrnen, nor the rest of the Spa-
niards, mould have conversation with them upon any ac-
count whatsoever; that they should be kept from coming
within a certain distance of, our castle; and if they dared
to offer us any violence, either by spoiling, burning, killing,
or destroying any of the corn, plantings, buildings, fences,
or cattle, belonging to the society, we would shoot them as
freely as we would do beasts of prey, in whatsoever places
we should find them.
(( This sentence seemed very just to all,but themselves;
when,-like a merciful judge, I called out to the two honest
Englishmen, faying, *'. You must consider they ought not
to be starved neither; and since it will be some time before
they can raise corn and cattie of their own, let us give them
some corn to last them eight months, and for feed to sew,
by which time they'll raise some for themselves; let us also
bestow upon them six milch goats, four he ones, and.fix
kids, as well for their present support, as for a further in-
crease; with tools necessary for their work, as hatchets, an
. mk, saw, and otfeer'things coaveniertf to build them huU;
all which were agreed: but ^before they took them into pos-
session, 1 obliged them solemnly to swear, never to attempt
ary thing against us, or their countrymen, for the future.
Thus dismissing them from our society, they went away,
sullen and refractory, as though neither willing to go nor
stay; however, seeing no remedy, they took what provi-
sion was givers them, proposing to choose a convenient place
where they might live by themselves.
About five days after, they came to those limits appoint-
ed, in crder for more victuals, and sent me word by one
of my Spaniards, whom they called to, where they had
pitched their tents, and marked themselves out an habita-
tion and plantation, at the N. E. and most remote part of
the island. And, indeed, there they built themselves two
very handsome cottages, resembling our little castle, being
under the fide of a mountain, with some trees already
growing on three sides of it; so that planting a few more,
it would be obscured from sight, unless particularly sought
for. When these huts were finished, we gave them some
dry goat-skins for bedding and covering ; and upon their
giving us fuller assurances of their good behaviour for the
future, we gave them some peas, barley, and rice for sow-
ing, and whatever tools we could spare.
«* Six months did they live in this separate condition, in
.which they got their first harvest in, the .quantity of which
was but small, because they had planted but little land;
ibr, indeed, all their plantations being to form, made it
snore difficult, especially as it was a thing out of their ele-
ment; and when they were obliged to make their boards
and pots,*&c. they could make little or nothing of it. But
the rainy season coming on, put them into a greater per-
plexity for want of a cave to. keep their corn dry, and pre-
vent it from spoiling: and so much did this humble them,
that they begged of my Spaniards to help them* to which
the good-natured men readily consented, and in four day's
space, worked a great hale in the side of the hill for them,
large eneugh for their ^mrpose,- to (ecure tiheir command
other things from the rain, though not comparable to ours,
^vhich had several additional apartments.
"But a new whim possessed, these rogues about three
-quarters of a yearafter, which had like to have ruined u,s»
and themselves too: for it seems, being tired and weary
of this fort of living, which made them work for them-
selves, without hopes of changing thejr ccpdUxon, nothing
3
would serve them, but tint they would make a voyage t>
the continent, and try if they could seize upon some of the
savages, and bring them over as Caves, to do their drud-
'gery, while they lived at ease and pleasure.
Indeed the project was not so preposterous, if they had
EOt gone farther; but they neither did, not proposed any
thing, but what had mischief in the design, er the event.
One morning, these three fellows came down to the limited
station, and humbly desired to be admitted to talk with us,
which we readily granted; they told us, in short, that be-
ing tired of their manner of living, and the labour of their
'hands in sucrTemployments, not being sufficient to procure
"the necessaries of life, they only desired one of the canoes
we came over in, with some arms and ammunition for
their defence, and they would feck their fortunes abroad,
gnd never trouble us any more. To be sure, we were glad
'enough to get r:d of such wretched plagues; but yet ho-
nesty made us ingenuotsty represent to them, by what we
cursdves had fettered, the certain destruction they were
running into, either of be'ng starved to death or murdered
'by the savages. To this they very audaciously repl ed,
that they neither could nor would work; and corsequentjy
that they might as well Be starved abro \d as at home; and
'cs to their falling into the hands of the savages, why, if
they were .murdered, that was nothing to us, there was an
*tnd of them; neither had they any wives or children to
cry after them; nay, so inteit were they upon their voy-
age, that if the Spaniards had rot given them arms-, so
they had but the canoe they would have gone without
them,
"Though we could not well Tpare cur fire arms, rather
than they should go like naked men, we let them have two
muskets, a pistol, a cutlafb, and three hatchets, which were
thought very sufficient; we gave them also goats' flesh, a
great basket full of dried grapes, a pot of fresh butter, a
young live kid, and a large canoe sufficient to carry twenty
men. And thus, with a mast made of a long pole, and a
fail of six large goat-skins dried, having a fair breeze,
and a flood-tide with Oiem, they merrily failed away, the
Spaniards calling after them, Bon vejajo, no man ever ex-
pecting to fee them more.
«• When they were gone, the Spaniards and Englilhmen
would often fay to one anrther, " O how peaceably do we
,c now live, since t.ofe turbulent fellows have left us!"
H
Nothing could be farther from their thoughts than to be"
hold their faces any more; and yet scarce two and twenty
days had passed over their heads, but one of the English-
men, being abicad a planting, perceived, at a distance,
three men, well armed, approaching towards him. Away
he Bies with speed to our castle, and tells me and the rest,
that we were all undone, for that strangers were landed
upon the island, and who they were he could not tell; but
added that they were not savages but men habited, bear-
ing arms. Why then, said I, we have the less occasion
to be concerned, since, is they were not Indians, they mull
be friends; for [ am sure there is no Christian people upon
earth, but what will do us good rather than harm. But
while we were considering of the event, up came the three
Englishmen, whose voices we quickly knew, and so all our
admiration of that nature ceased at once. And our won-
der was succeeded by another sort of inquiry, which was,
what could be the occasion of their returning so quickly to
the island, when we little expected, and much less desired
their company? But as this was better to be related by
themselves, I ordered them to be brought in, when they
gave me the fallowing-,relation of their voyage.
"After two days fail, or something less, they reached
land, where they found the people coming to given them
another fort of reception than what they expected or de-
fined ; for, as the savages were armed with bows and ar-
rows, they durst not venture on shore, but steered north-
ward, six or seven hours, till they gained an opening, by
which they plainly perceived, that the land that appeared
from this place, was not the nuin land, but an island. At
their entrance into the opening of the sea, they discovered
another Mland, on the right hand northward, and several
mere lying to the westward; but being resolved to . go on
.fhcre some where or other, they put over to one of the
western islands. Here they found the natives very courte-
ous to them, giving them several roots and dried silh; nay,
even their women too were as willing to supply them with
what thry could procure them to eat, bringing it a great
way to them upon their heads. Among these hospitable
Jndians they continued some days, inquiring by signs and
tc kens, what nations lay around them ; and were informed,
that there were several fierce and terrible people lived
,*very way, accustomed to eat mankind; but for them-
selves they never used such diet, except those that wei a
taken in battle, and os them they made a solemn feast.
(f The Englishmen inquired how long it was since they*
had a feast os that kind ? They answered, about two moons
ago, pointing to the moon; and then two fingers; that,
at this time, their king had two hundred prisoners, which
were fattening up for the slaughter. ^ The Enghshmeti
were mighty desirous of feeing the prisoner, which the
others mistaking, thought that they wanted some os them
se-r their own food: upon which they beckoned to them,
pointing to the rising, and then to the setting os the sun;
meaning, that by the time it appeared in the east next
morning, they would bring them some; and indeed they
were as good as their word; for by that time they brought
eleven men and five women, just as so many cows and
oxen are brought to sea-port town*, to victual a ship. But
as brutish as these Englishmen were, their stomachs turned
at the fight. What to do in this cafe, they could not tell r
to refuse the prisoners, would have been the highest affront
offered to the savage gentry; and to dispose of them, they*
knew not in what manner; however, they resolved to ac-
cept them, and so gave them, in return, one of their
hatchets, an old key, a knife, and fix or seven of their
bullets; things which, tho' they were wholly ignorant of,
yet they seemed entirely contented with; and dragging the
poor wretches into the boat, with their hands bound behind
them, delivered them to the Englishmen. But this obliged
them to put off as soon as they had these presents, lest ihe
donors should have expected two or three of them to be
killed, and to be invited to dinner the next day; and so
taking leave with all possible respect and thanks, though
neither of them understood what the others said, they sailed
away back to the first island, and there set eight of the
prisoners at liberty. In their voyage they endeavoured to
comfort, and have some conversation with the poor cap-
tives; but it was impossible to make them sensible of any
thing; and nothing they could say or give, or do for them*'
could make them otherwise persuaded, but that they were
unbound only to be devoured: if they gave them any
food, they thought it was only to fatten them for the
slaughter; or looked at any one more particularly, the
poor creature supposed itself to be the first sacrifice; and
even when we brought them to our island, and began to
H 2
we tkm with the greatest humanity and kindness, yet they
expected every day that their new mailers would devour
them.
"And thus, Sir, did these three strange wanderers con-
clude their unaccountable relation of their voyage, which
was both amazing and entertaining. Hereupon, I asked
them, where their new family was? They told me, they
had put them into one of their huts, and they came to beg
some victuals for them. This, indeed, made us all long
to fee them; and taking Friday's father with us, leaving
only two at our castle, we came down to behold these poor
creatures.
€i When we arrived at the hut, (they being bound again
ly the Eng'ifhmen, for fear of escaping) we found them
ilark naked, expecting their fatal tragedy; there were
^three lusty men, well shaped, with straight and good limbs,
between thirty and five and thirty years old; and five wo-
r»en, two of-them might be from thirty to forty, two more
rot above four and twenty; and the UHt a comely tall
itsaiden of about seventeen. Jridead, all the women were
very agreeable, both in propcrtioi and features, except
that they were tawny, which their modest behaviour, and
ciher graces, made amends fer, when th/y afterwards
came to be clothed.
<f This naked appearance, together with their miserable
circumstances,.was po very comfortable sight to my Spa-
niards, who, for their pans, I may venture, Sir, without
fUtiery, to fay, are men of the test behaviour, calmest:
tampers, and. sweetest nature, that can poflibfy be; for
they immediately ordered-Fridays father to see if he knew
any of them, or Js he understood what they could (ay.
No, sooner did the old Indian appear, but he looked at
them with .great, seriousness.; y^e% as they were not of his
ration, they were utter stiangers to him, and none could
understand.his speech or st *ns, but one woman. Tnis was
enough , to answer the dengn; which was to,assure them
t*aey would not be "killed,_ being fallen into the hands of
.Christians, ,wh? abhorred such barbarity. When they
Ayere sully satisfied of this, they expressed their joy by such
f rar*ge gestures, and4 uncommon tones, as it is not possible.
for me to describe. Bat the woman, their interpreter, was
crdere^ nfxt "to Inc^irC,* whether they were content'to be
.servant*, and world w:>rk for the men who had brought
•then* hither to save their lives? Hereupon, (being at this
tfine unbound) they fell a capering and dancing, one ta-
king this thing upon her shoulders, and the1 other that, in-
timating, that they were willing to do any thing for therr.
But now, Sir, having women among us, and dreading that
it might occasion some strife, if mt blood, I asked t-he thres
mm what they would do, and how they intended, to ufe
these creatures, whether as servants or women? One of
them very pertly and readily answered, they, would use them
as bfcth. Gentlemen, said I, as you are your own maibis,
I am not gcing to restrain you from that; bat methinks,
fcr avoiding diiTt-nticns among you, I would only dsxirz
you to engage, that none of )ou will take more than ouj
for a woman cr wife, and that -having taken this one, none
else should presume to touch her; for though we have nt'C-
a priestly authority to marry you, yet it is bat reasonably
that whoever thus takes a woman, should be obliged M
maintain her, since nobody has any thing to do *ita her;.
and this, indeed, appeared so just to all present, that it was
unanimously agreed to/ The Englishmen then ailed my
Spaniaids, whither they designed to take any of them? bit
they ail ar fevered, No; some declaring they had al read/
wives in Spain ;-and others that they cured not to join wit.l
infidels. On the reverse, the Englishmen took each c£
them a temporary wife, and so set up a new method of li-
ving. As to Friday's father, the Spaniards, and the thres
savage servants we hud taken in the late battle, they ail
lived .vith me in cur ancient castle; ztid indeed we supplied
the main pastes the island with food, as necessity required.
But the most remarkable part of the story if, how these
E^gliftrnen, who had been so much at variance, should
agree about the choke of those women; yet they took a
way gocid enough to prevent quarrelling among theraselvt s.
Ihey set the five women in one of their huts, and going,
trjernsclves to the other, drtw lots which sir.uld havt* the
Mrst choxe. Now, he that h?.d the first lot went to the hut,
and fetched out her he chose ; and it is remarkable, that ha
took her that was the most homely and eldest of the num-
ber, which-made the rest of the Englishmen exceeding!/
merry; the Spaniards themselves could not but smile at it;
But, as it happened, the fellow had-the best.,thought, in
choosing one fit for application and business; and indecd-
ihe proved the best wife of all the parcel.
But when the poor creatures perceived themselves pieces
in a row, and separated one by one, they were again seises
with an unspeakable terror, as now thinking they were
going to be slain in earnest; and when the Englishmen
Came to uke the first, the rest: set up a lamentable cry,
clasped their arms arourd her neck, and hanging about
her, took their last farewej, as they thought, in such trem-
bling agonies, and affectionate embraces, as would have
softened the hardest heart in the world* and made the driest
eyes mek inio tears; nor could they be persuaded but that
they were go'ng to die, till such time as Friday's father
made them sensible that the Englishmen had chosen them
for their wives, which ended ail their terror and concern
upon this occasion.
*< Well, after this, the Englishmen went to work, and
being assisted by my good-natured Spaniards, in a few hours
they erected every one of them a new hut or tent for their
separate lodging, since those they had already were silled
%vith tools, household stuff, and provision. They all con-
tinued on the north snore of the island, but separate as be-
fore; the three wicked ones pitching farther rff," and the
two honest men nearer our castle ; so that the island seemed
to be peopled in three places, three towns beginning to be
built for that purpose. And here I cannot but remark,
v/hat is very common, that the two hones! men had the
worst wives, (I mean as to industry, cleanliness, and inge-
nuity) while the three reprobates enjoyed women of quite
contrary qualities.
"But another observation I made was, in favour of the
two honest men, to ihow what disparity there is between a
ciiligent application to business, on the one hand, and a
ilothful, negligent, and idle temper, on the other. Both
Of them had the fame parcel of ground laid out, and corn
to sow, sufficient for them ; but both did not make the same
improvements, either in their cultivation or their plant"
ang. The two honest men had a multitude of young trees
planted about their habitations, so that when you approach-
ed near them, nothing appeared but a wood, very pleasing
and delightful. Every thing they did prospered and flou-
rished; their grapes, planted in order, seemed as though
managed in a vineyard, and were infinitely preferable to
any of the ethers. Nor were they wanting to find cut a
place of retreat, but dug a cave in the most retired part of
a thick wood, to secure their wives and children, with their
provision and chiefest goods, surrounded with innumerable
stakes, and having a most subtle entrance, in case any mis-
chief should happen, eitlner from their fellow countrymen,
ot the devouring savages. ,
'"' As to the reprobates, (though I must own they were
much more civilized than before) instead cf a delightful
wood surrounding their dwellings, we found the words of
Kirg Solomon too truly verified; "I went by the vineyard
«'* of the slothful, and it was all overgrown with thorns/'
In many places their crop was obscured by weeds; th;
hedges having several gaps in them, the wild goats had
got in, and eaten up the corn, and here and there was a
dead bush to stop these gaps for the present, which was
no more than shutting the stable dour alter the steed was
stolen away. But as to their wives*, they (as I observed
before i weje more diligent, and cleanly enough, especially
in their victuals, being instructed by one of the honest men,
who had been a cook's mate on board a (hip: and very
well it was so; for as he cooked himself, his companion
and their families lived as well as the idle husbands, who
did nothing but loiter about, fetch turtle's eggs, catch fish
and birds, and do any thing but work, and lived accord-
ingly; while the diligent lived very handsomely and plen-
tifully, in the most comfortable manner,
".And now, Sir, I gome to lay bsfore your eyes a scene
quite different from any thing that ever happened to us be-
fore, and perhaps ever befel you in all the time of your
residence on this island. I shall inform you os its original
in the following manner:
«' One morning, Sir, very early, there came five or six
canoes of Indians on shore, indisputably upon their old
custom of devouring their prisoners. All that we had to
do 'upon such an occasion, was to lie concealed, that, they,
not having any notice of inhabitants, might depart quietly,
after performing their bloody execution : whoever first dis-
covered thee savages, was to give notice to all the thr^e
plantations to keep within doors, and then a proper scout
was to be placed to give intelligence of their departure,
#J>ut, notwithstanding these wise measures, an unhappy dis-
aster discovered us to the savages, which was like to have
caused the desolation of the whole island; for, after the sa-
vages were gone tfFin their canoes, some of my Spaniards
and I looking abroad, and being inflamed with a curiouiity
to fee what they-had been doing, to our great amazement
beheld three savages fast asleep on the ground, who, either
being gorged, could not awake when the othejs went ofF*

cr having wandered too far into the wood?,, .did.-not'^coiML'
back in time.
*' What to do with them at first, we could net not tel!; as-
for jskves we had enough of them already; and as to kill-.
ing them, neither Christianity or humanity would suffer
us to faed t: e blood of persons who never did us wrong.
We perceived ihey had no boat left their, to transport ibem.-
to their cvvn nation; and th^h by letting th?m wanderabout*
they might discover us, and inform the first, savages that,
ihocld happen to la. d upon ihe fame bloody occ=inn, which
information might entirely ruin us; and therefore I coun-
selled nry Spaniards to secure thvm,, and set them about-
some work or other, till we could better dispose of them.
(t Hereupon we all went back, and making them awake,,
took them prisoners. It is impossible to express the horror;
they v*e;e in, especially when bound, as thinking they were,
going to be murdered arid eaten, but we soon eased them-
os their sear as to that point. We first took them to the.
bovver, where the ciiiefof ©ur country work lay, as keep-
ing goats,'planting corn, &c. and thtn carried them to the,
two Englishmen's habitation, to help them in their busi-
ness; but happy it was for us aU.we did not carry them to,
our castle, as by the sequel will appear. The Englishmen,,
indeed, found them work to do; but whether they did not
guard them strictly, or that they thought they could not
better themselves, I cannot tell; but certainly one of them,
ran away into the woods, and they could not hear of him:
for a long time after.
Undoubredly there was reason enough to suppose he get
. home in some of the canoes, the savages returning in about
four weeks time, and going cjŒ" in the space of two day-.
You may be certain, Sir, this thought could not but ter-
rify us exceedingly, and make .us justly conclude, that the
savage would inform his countrymen of our abode in the
isiand, how few and' weak we were in comparison to their
numbers; and we expected it would not be kng before the
Englishmen would be attacked in their habitations; but the
savages had not seen their places of safety in the woods^
nor our casJe, which it was a great happiness they did not
know. '^ -.•
"Nor were we mistaken in our thoughts upon this oc-
casion ; for, about eight months after this, six canoes, withj.
abcur ten men in each cance, came failing by- the north -
fide of the island, which they were never accustomed to da

oesore, and landed about an hour after sunrise, near a mile
from the dwelling of the two Englishmen, who, it seem?,
had the good fortune to difCoyer them about a league off:
so that it was an tour before they could attain the ihor%
and some time hunger before they could come at them.
And now being confirmed in dis opinion that they wes
certainly betrayed, they immediately bound the two slave 5
which were left, caufuvg two of the three men, whom the /
brought with, the wome*, and who proved very faithful, 11
lead them with their wives, and other conveniences, inti>
their retired ere in the wood, and there to bind the twa
fellows hand and foot, v\l they had further orders. The/
then opened their fences, where they kept their milch goat?,
and drove them all out, giving the goats liberty to rambla
in the woods, to make die savages beikve that they wera
wild ones; but the slave had given a truer information»
which made them come to the very inclosures. The two
frighted men sent the ether stave of the three, who had
been with them by accident, to alarm the Spaniards, ani
delxre their assistance; in the mean time they took their
arms and ammunition* and made to the cave where they
had sent their wives, and securing their slave", seated them-
selves in a private place, from whence they might behold
all the actior s of the savages. Nor had they gone far,
when ascending a rising ground, they could see a little army
of Indians approach to their beautiful dwelling, and in a
few moments more, perceive the fame, and their furniture,
to their unspeakable grief, burning in a consuming flame:
and when this was done, they spread here and there, search*,
ing every busli and place for the people, of whom it was
>ery evident, they had information. Upon which the two
Englishmen, not thinking themselves secure where they
stood, retreated about half a mile higher in the country,
rightly concluding, that the farther the savages strolled,
there *vould be less numbers together: upon which they
»ext took their stand by the trunk of an old tree, very hol-
low and large, whence they resolved to-fee what would
offer; but they had not stood long there, before two sa-
vages came running directly towards-them, as though ha-
ving knowledge of their being there, who seemed resolved
to attack them; a little farther were i^ree more, and five
more behind them again, all running the fame way Is?
cannot be imagined the perplexity the poor men were m
at this fight, thinking that t assistance did not speedily
Hi:
come, their cave in the wood would be discovered, and
consequently all therein lost; so they resolved to resist them
there, and, when overpowered, to ascend to the top os the
trees, where they might defend themselves as long as their
fimmunkicn lasted, ar.d fell their lives as dear .as possible to
those devouring savages. Thus fixed in their resolution,
they next considered, whether they should sire at the first
two, or wait for the three, and so take the middle party,
by which the two first and the five last would be separated.
In-this regulation the. two savages also confirmed them, by
turning a little to another part os the wood; but the threiy
and the rive aster them, came directly towards the tree*
Hereupon they resolved to take them in a direct line, as
they approached nearer, because perhaps the first shot
might hit them ail three; and upon this occasion, the man
who-was to fire, charged his piece with three or four bul-
lets. And thus while they were waiting, the savages came
on, one of them was the runaway, who had caused all the
mischief; so they resolved he should not escape, if they
both fired at once. But, however, thcugh*they did not
fire together, they were ready charged; when the first that
Jet fly, was too gcod a marksman to miss his aim; for he
killed the foremost outright, the second (who was the run-
away Indian) iell to the ground, being shot through the
body, but not dead, and the third was a little wounded in
the shoulder, who, sitting down en the ground, fell a scream-
ing in a most feajr-ful manner. The noise of the guns,
which not only made the most resounding echoes, from
one side to the other, but raised the birds of all forts, flat-.,
tering with the most confused noise, so much terrified the
five, savages behind, that they stood still at first, like so
many inanimate images But when all things were in
profound silence, they came to the place where their com-
panions lay; and here, not being sensible that they were
liable to the same sate, stood over the wounded man,, un-.
doubtedly inquiring the occasion os this fad calamity; and'
'tis as reasonable to suppose, he told them, that it came by
thunder and lightening from the gods, having never seen or
}\eard of a gun before, in the whole course of their lives.
By this time the Englishmen, having loaded their pieces,
'fired both together a second time, when seeing them all sail
immediately on the grpund, they thought they had killed
every creature of thcm\ This made them come up boldly
fee/ere they had charged their guns, which, indeed, was a
wrong step; for, whea the came to the place* they sound
four alive, two of them very little wounded, and one not
at all, which obliged them to fall upon them with their
muskets; they first: knocked the runaway savage on the
head, and another that was but a little wounded in the
arm, and then put the other languishing wretches out of
their pain ; while he that was not hurt, with bended knees
and uplifted hands, made piteous moans, and signs to
them to spare his life; noi, indeed, were they unmerciful
to the poor wretch, but pointed to him to sit down at the
root of a tree hard by; and then, one of the Englishmen,
with a piece of rope twinz he had in his pocket, by mere
chance, tying his two feet fall together, and his two hands
behind him, they left him there, making all the haste they
could after the other two, searing they should find out
their cave; but though they could not overtake them, they
had the satisfaction to perceive them at a distance, cross a
valley towards the sea, a quite contrary k:ay to their re-
treat; upon which they returned to the iree,^® look after
their prisoner; but when they canae there, he was gone,
leaving the piece cf rope-yarn, wherewith he was bound,
behind him.
<* Wd\, now they were as much concerned as ever, as
not knowing how near their enemies might be, or in what
numbers. Immediately they repaired 10 the cave, to fee
if all was well there, and found every thing safe, except
the women, who were frighted upon their husbands ac-
count, whom they now loved entirely. They had not
been long here, before seven of my Spaniards came to
affili them; while the other ten, tneir servants, and Fri-
day's father, were gone to defend their bo*er, corn, and
cattie, in cafe the Ravages should have rambled so far.
There accompanied the seven Spaniards, one us the three
savages that had formerly been taken prisoner; and with
them also that very Indian whom the Englishmen had, a
little before, left under, the tree; for it seems, tney paiied
by tnat way where the slaughter was madei and so carried
along wicn them that poer wretch, hat was left bound. But
so many prisoners now becoming a burthen to us. and fear-
ing the dreadful consequence or their escaping, moil of the
Spaniards and Englifn urged the absolute necessity there,
was cf killing them for our common preservation; out,
Sir, the authority I bore, as a governor, over-ruled liiat
piece of cruelty; and then J ordered them to be sent pxi—
H6
soners to the eld cave ki the valley, bcund hands snd feefj
with two Spaniards to guard them*
** So much encouraged were the Englishmen at the ap>
proach of the Spaniards, and so great was their fury against:
the savages for destroying their habitations, that they had
not patience to stay any longer; but, taking five Spaniards
along with them, armed with four muskets, a pistol, and a
quarter staff, away they went in pa-suit of their enemies.
As they passed by the place where the savages were stain,
it was very easy to be perceived that more of them had
been there, having attempted to carry off their dead bo-
dies, but sound it impraclicale. From a rising ground,
our party had the mortification to see the smoke that pro-
ceeded from the ruins; when coming farther in sight of
the shore, they p'ainly perceived that the savages had em-
barked in their canoes, and were putting out to sea. This
they were veiy sorry for, there being no coming at them
to give them a parting salute; but however, they were glad
enough to get clear of such unwelcome guests*
"Thus the t*o honest:, but unfortunate Englishmen,
being ruined a second time, and their improvements quite
destroyed, most of my good natuied Spaniards helped them
to rebuild, atd we z\l assisted them with needful supplies;
nay, what is more remarkable, their three mischievot£.
countrymen, wh^n they heardof it, (which was after all these
disasters were over, they living more remote eastward) very
friendly sympathised with them, and worked for them se-
veral dayt; so that, in a little, their habitations was rebuilt,
their necessities supplied, and themselves restored to their
former tranquillity.
<< Though the savages had nothing to boast of in this
adventure, (several canoes being driven astiore, followed
by two drowned cteaturcs. having undoubtedly met with a'
storm at sea that very night they departed) yet it was na-
tural to be supposed, that those whose better fortune it was
ta attain their native shore, would inflame their nation to
another ruinous attempt, wiih a greater fierce, to carry all
before them. And, indeed, so it* happened$ for about
seven months after, our island was invaded*with a most
formidable rravy, ao less than eight and twenty canoes full'
of savages, armed with wooden swords, monstrous clubs,
bows and arrows, and" such like instruments of war, iand^
kg at the cast-end of the island*
"Yen may well, Sir, imagine, what consternation cur .
men were in upon this account, and how speedy they were
to execute their resolution, having only that night's time
allowed them, They knew, that since they could not
withstand their enemies, concealment was the only way to
procure their safety; and, therefore, *they took down the
huts that were built for the two Englishmen, and drove;
their flocks of goats, together with their own at the bower,
to the old cave in the valley, leaving as little appearance
of inhabitants as possible; and then posted themselves, with
all their force, at the plantation of the two men. 4.s they
expected, so it happened; for early the next morning, the
Indians, leaving their canoes at the east-end of the island,
came running along the shore, about two hundred and fifty
in number, as near as could be guessed. Our army was
but little indeed; and what was our greatest misfortune, we
had not arms sufficient for them. The account, as to the
men, Sir, is as follows; viz. 17 Spaniards, 5 Englishmen,
Old Friday, the three savages, taken with the five women,
who proved faith&d servants, and three other staves, living
with the Spaniards. To arm these* they had u, muskets,
5 pistols, 3 fowling-pieces, 2 swords, 3 old halberts, 5
mu&ets, or fowling-pieces, taken from the sailors whom
you reduced. As to the staves, we gave three of them
halberts, and the other three long staves, with great iron,
spikes at the end of them, with hatchets by their fides;
we also had hatchets sticking in our girdles, besides the
fire-arms: nay, two of the women, inipired with Amazo-
nian fortitude, could not be dissuaded from fighting along
with their dear husbands, and if they died* to die with
them. Seeing their resolution, we ^gave them hatchets
likewise; but what pleased them best, were the bows and
arrows (which they dexterously knew how to use) that the
Indians had left behind them, after their memorable battle
one against another,
"X)ver this army, whkh though little, was of great in-*
trepiaity, I was constituted chief general and commander;
and knowing Will Atkins, though exceedingly wicked, yet
a man of invincible courage, I gave him the power of
commanding under me ^ he had six men with their muskets
loaded with fa or seven bullets a-piece, and were planted
just behind a small thicket of bushes, as an advanced guard,
having orders to let the first pass by; and then, when he
#red into the middle of them,, making a nimble retread
round a part of the wood, and so come in the rear os the
Spaniards, who were shaded by a thicket cf tsees: for
though the savages came on with the fierceness of lions, yet
they wanted the subtilty of foxes, being out of all manner
of order, and straggling in heaps every way; and, indeed,
when Will Atkins, after fifty of the savages had pasted by,
had ordered three of his men to give fire, so great was thdr
consternation, to fee so many men killed and wounded, and
hear such a dreadful noise, and yet knew not whence it
came, that they were frightened to the highest degree ; and
when the second volley was given, they concluded no less
but that their companions were slain by thunder and lighten-
ing from Heaven. In this notion they would have con «
tinued", had Will Atkins and his men retired, as soon as-
they fired, according to order; or had the rest been near
them, to pour in their (hot continually, there might hav£
been a complete victory obtained; but staying to load their
pieces again, discovered the whole matter. They were
perceived by some of the scattering savages at a distance,
who let sty their arrows am >ng them, wounded Atkins him-
self, and killed his fellow Englishman, and one of the In-
dions taken with the-women. Our party did not fail to
answer them, and in their retreat killed about twenty sa-
vages. Here I cannot but take notice of our poor dying
Have, who, tho'stopt from his retreat by a fatal arrow, yet
with his staff and hatchet, desperately and gallantly assailed;
his pursuers, and killed five of the savages, before his life
submitted to a multiplicity of wounds. Nor is tae cruelty or
malice of the Indians to be l^fs remarked,, in breaking the
arms legs, and heads of the two dead bodies, with their
clubs and wooden swords, after a most wretched manner.
As Atkins retreated our party advanced, to interpose be-
tween him and the savages; but, after three voilies, we
were obliged to retreat also; for they were so numerous and
desperate,. that they came up to our very teeth, shot their
arrows like a cloud, and their wounded men, enr3ged with
cruel pain*, fought like madmen. They ud not, however,
think fit to follow us, but drawing themselves up in a cir-
cle, they gave two triumphant snouts in token of victory.,
though they had the grief to fee several of their wounded
men bleed to death before them.
A^cer I had,* Sir, drawn up our little army together,
upon a rising ground-, Atkins, wounded as he was, would..
have had us attack'the whole body of the savages.at once.
I was extremely well pleased, with the gallantry os the man;
but, upon consideration, I replied, " You perceive, Seig-
«* nior Atkins, how their wounded men fight; let them
Ct alone till morning, when they will be faint, stiff, and fore,
«* and then we mail have fewer to combat with." Td
which Atkins, smiling replied, "That's very true, Seig-
c< nior, so shall I too; and that's the reason I would fight
€t them now I am warm." We all answered, Seignior
Atkins for your part, you have behaved very gallantly;
and, if you are not afce to approach the enemy in the
morning, we will fight for you, till then we think it con-
venient to wait, and so we tarried.
"By the brightness of the moon that night, we perceived
the savages in great disorder about their dead and wounded
men. This madaus- change our resolution, and resolve
to fall upon them in the night, if we could give them one
i-olley undiscovered. This we had a fair opportunity to*
do, by one of the two Englishmen leading us round* be-.
tween the woods and the sea-side westward, and turning
short south, came privatpjy to a place where the thickest
them were. Unheard ami unperceived, eight of us fired
among them, and did dreadful execution; and in. half a
minute after, eight more of us let fly, killing and wound-
ing abundance of them; and then dividing ourselves into
three bodies, eight persons in each body, we marched
from among the trees, to the very teeth of the enemy,
sending forth the greatest shouts and acclamations. The
savages hearing a different noise from three quarters at
once, stood in the utmost confusion; but coming in sight
of us, let fly a volley of arrows, which wounded poor old
,Friday, yet happily it did not prove mortal.. We did not,
however, give them a second opportunity; but rushing in
among them, we fired three several ways, and then fell to
work wi-.h our swords, staves, hatchets, and the butt-end;
of our muskets, with, a fury not to be resisted; so that, with
the most dismal screaming and howling they had recourse
to their feet, to save their lives by a {pctdy flight. Nor
must we forget the valour of the two women; for they
exposed themselves to the greatest dangers killed many
with their arrows, and valiantly destroyed several more
with their ftatchets.
"In fighting these two battles, we were so much tired*
that we did not then trouble ourselves to 'pursue them to>
iheir canoes, in which we thought they would presently

to the place of battle, where several of the lavages were
expiring, a fight no way pleasing to generous minds, to
delight ist misery, though obliged to conquer them" by the
law of arms; but our oWn Indian slaves put them cut of
their pain, by despatching them with their hatchets. At
length, coming in view of the remainder of the army, we
found them leaning -upon their knees, which were bended^
towards their mouth, and the head between the two hand% .
Hereupon, coming within mufket-fhot ofthein* I ordered
two pieces to be hied without ball, in order to alarm them,
that we might plainly know, whether they had the courage
to venture another battle, or were utterly dispirited fronsi
such an attempt, that so we might accordingly manage
them. And, indeed, tile project took very well; for, no
sooner did the savages hear the first gun, and perceive the. -
flash of the sec nd, but tliey suddenly started upon their
feet, in the greatest consternation; and when we apf reach-
ed towards them, they ran howling and screaming away up ,
the hill into the country,
** We could rather, *t first, have wished, that the wea-
ther had permitted them 'to have gone off to the sea; but
when we considered, that their escape might occasion the.
approach of multitudes, to our utter ruin a^d dissolution,
we were very well pleased the contrary happened: and
Will Atkins ^who, though wounded, would nut part from
ns al! this while) advised us not to let slip this advantage, .
but clapping between them and their boats, deprive them
of• the capacity of ever returning to plague the island:*
*' 1 know," said he, *' there is but one objection you can
*f make, which is, that these creatures living like beafis/ -
tf in thjevvood, may make excuriions, rifle the plantation?,
** and destroy the tame goats; b*u then, confider, we had
*' bettef to do with an hundred men,„ whom we "can kill/
<* or mate slaves of at leisure, than with an hundred iva-
** tioBs, whom, it" is, impoffiblc we should save ourselvssu
OF-ROBIKSOW CRUSO£*- l-8£
** from, much less subdue." This advice,: and.these ar*
guments being approved of^we set fife to their boats; and
though they were so wet that we could, not burn them en-
t'rely, yet we made them incapable far swimming in the
seas. As soon as the Indians perceived what we were do-
ing, many of them ran out of the woods, in sight of u&
and kneeling down, piteoefly cried, out* Oa, Oa, Warama*
hex. Intimating* I suppose, that, if "we would but spare their
canoes, they would never trouble us again.
"But all-their complaints, submissions, and entreaties^
were in vam; for self-preservation obliging us to the con-
trary, we^destfoyed every one of them that had escaped
the fury of the ocear.. When the Indians perceived thi?,
they raffed a lamentable cry* and ran into the woods, where
they continued ranging about, making the woods ring with'
their lamentation. Here we ihould have considered, that
making these creatures thus desperate, we ought, at the
same time to have set a sufficient guard upon the planta-
tions: for the savages, in their ranging about, found out
the bower, destroyed the fences, trod the corn down under
their feet, and tore up the vines and grapes. It is true,
we were always able to fight these crearures; but, as they
were too swift for us, and very numerous, we durst not go
out single, for fear of them ; 'though'that too was needless,
they having no weapons, nor any materials to make them;'
and, indeed, their extiemity appeared in a lit.le time after.
"Though the savages, as already mentioned, had de-
stroyed our bower, and all our corn, grapes, &e* yet we

cf Will Atkins and his companions, one of whom beings
killed by an arrow,.they were new reduced to two: it :s re-
markable that this was the fellow *ho cut the poor Indian
with h's hatchet, and had a design to murder me and my
countrymen the Spaniards. As cur condition was so low,
we cane to the resolution to drive the savages up to the
farther part of the island, where no Indians landed; to kill'
as many of them as we could, till we had reduced their
number; and then to give the remainder some corn ter
plant, ?nd to teach them how to live by their daily labpfiiy'
Acco.dirgly we pursued them with our guns, at the hear-;
ing of which they were so terrified, that they would fall t6
the ground. Every day we killed and wounded some of
them, and many were found starved to death, so that our
hearts began to relent at the fight of such miserable ob-
jects. At last, with great difficulty, taking one of them
alive, and using him with kindness, and tenderness, we
brought him to Old Fridajr, who talked to him, and told
him, how good we would be to them alii giving them corn
and land to plant and live in, and present nourishment,
provided they should keep within such bounds as stiou'ld be
allotted them, and not do prejudice to others: " Go then,"
said he, "and inform your country men of this; which,
*' if they will not agree to, every one of them shall be:
"slain." .
*f The poor creatures, thoroughly humbled, being re-
duced to about thirty-seven, joyfully accepted the offer, and'
earnestly begged.for food; hereupon we sent twelve Spa-
niards and two Englishmen, well armed, together with Old
Friday, and three Indian (laves were loaded with a large
quantity of bread and rice cakes, with three live goats,:
and the poor Indians being orderedto sit dov*n on the side
of the hill, they ate the victuals very thankfully, and have
proved faithful to the last, never trespassing beyond their
bounds, where at this day they quietly and happily re-
main, and where we now and then ^ifit them. They are
confined to a neck of land about a mile and a half broad,
and three or four in length, on the south-east corner of the
island, the sea being before, and lofty mountains behind
them, free from the appearance of canoes; and indeed
their countrymen never made any inquiry after them. We
gave them twelve hatchets, and three cr four knives; hare
taught them to build huts, make wooden spades, pi art corn,
make bread, breed tame goats and milk them, %$ likewise
to?make wicker-work, in which I must ingenuously con-
fess, they infinitely outdo us, having made themselves se-
veral pretty necessaries and fancies, a* baskets, sieves, bird-
cages, and cupboards, as also stools, beds, and couches, no
less useful than delightful; and now they live the most
innocent and inoffensive creatures that ever were subdued
in the world, wanting noihing but wives to make them a
nation.
t€ Thus, kind Sir, have"! given you, according tQ my
ability, an impartial account of the various transactions
that have happened in the island since your departure, to
this day; and we have great reason to acknowledge tEe
kind providence of Heaven in our merciful deliverance.
When you inspect your little kingdom, you'will find in it
some little improvements your flocks increased, and your
subjects augmented, so that from a desolate island, as this
was before your wonderful deliverance upon it, here is a
visible prospect os its becoming a populous and well go-
verned little kingdom, 10 your immortal fame and glory."
There is no doubt to suppose bot that the preceding re-
lation os my faithful Spaniard was very agreeable, and no
Jess surprising to me, to the young priest", and to all who
heard it: nor were these people less pleased with those ne-
cessary utensils that I brought them, such as the knives,
scissars, spades, shovels, and pick-axes, with which they•>
now adern their habitations*
So much had they addicted themselves to wicker-work,
prompted by the ingenuity of the Indians, who assisted
them, that when I viewed the Englishmen's colonies, they
seemed at a distance as though they, had lived like bees in
a hive: for Will Atkins, who was now become a very in-
dustrious and sober man, had made himself a tent of basket-
work round the outside; the walk were worked in as a
baiket, in pannels or strong squares of thirty-two in num-
ber, standing about sepen feet high: in the middle was ano-
ther, net above twenty-two paces round, but much stronger
built, being of an octagonal form, and in the eight cor-
ners stood eight strong posts> round the top of. which he
kid strong pieces, pinned v.ith woeden pins, from which
he raised a pyramid for the roof,, mighty pretty, I assure
you, end joined very well together, with iron spikes,
which he made himself; £ r he had made him a. forge,
with a pair of wooden bellows and charcoal for his work,
forming an anvil out of one of the iron crows, to work
upon, and in this manner would he make himself hoojes,
fraples, spikes, bolts, and hinges. After he had pitched
the roof cf his innermost tent, he made it so firm between
the rafters with baiket-work, thatching that over again with
rice-straw, and over that a large leaf cf a tree, that his
house was as dry as if it had been tiled or slated. The
outer circuit was covered as a lean-to, quite round this inner
apartment, lading long rafters from the thirty-twd angles
to the top posts of the inner house, about twenty feet distant
so that there was a space like a wall between the outer and
inner wall, near twenty feet in breadth. The inner place he
jsartitiontd effwith the same wicker-work, dividing it i&-
to six neat apartments every one of which had a door, firiir
into the entry of the main tent,, and another into the space
and walk that was round it, not only convenient for re-?
treat, but For family neceii'aries. Within the door of ths
Outer circle, there was a railage directly to the doer of the
inner house; on either fide was a wicker partition, and a>
door, by which >oa go into a room twenty-two sect wid^,
and cbout thiity long, and through that into another of x
{mailer length; so that in the ou*er circle were ten hand-
some rooms, fix of which were only to be come at through*
the apartments of the inner tent, serving as retiring rooms
to the respective chambers-of the inner circle, ard four
Idrge warehouses, which went in through one another, twa
on either hand of-the passage that led through the cuter
door to the inner tent. In short, nothing - could be built
more ingeniously, kept mere nea% orx have better conve-
niences; and here lived (he three familirs, Will Aikia*,
his companion, their wive and children, and the widow/
of the deceased. As to religion, the men seldom taught
their wives-the knowledge-of God, anymore than the.
sailors' custom of swearing. Vy his name. The-greatest-
improvement their wives had, was, they taught them to
{peak English, so as to be Lnderilood..*
None of their children weie then above fix years old j
they were all fruitful enovgh ;** and I think the cook**
mate's wife was big of her sixth child.
When I inquired of the* Spaniards about their circum-
stances while among the savage?, they told me, that they-
abandoned themselves to despair, reckoning themselves a
ppcf and miserable people, that had no means putinto the'r-
hands, artd consequently mult soon be .staived.ro death.-
They owned, however* that they were in the wrong ta
think sq, and for refusing the a&starce thtt reason offend.
for their support,, as well as future deliverance, centering
that grief uas a most insignificant passion, as U looked
upon things-as.without remedy, and having no hope o£~c
things to come; all which verified this noted proverb,.
In trouble to bis troubled,
is to have your trouble doubled.
NciviHd" his remarks end here y for, making observa-
tions upon my improvemer t, and on my condition at first*
Infinitely worse than theirs, he told me, that Engfislimea
hid, in their distress, greater presence of miad than those
-of any other country that he had met with; and that they
&nd the Portuguese were the worst men in the world to
struggle under misfortunes. When they landed among
the savages, they found out little provision except tHey
would turn cannibals, there being bat a few roots anl
iierbs, with little substance in them, and of which the na-
tives gave them but very sparingly. Many were the ways
they took to civilize and teach the savages, but in vain;
for they would not own them to l>e their instructors, whose
lives were owing to their bounty. Their extremities were
very great, and many days being entirely without food, the
savages there being .more indolent and less devouring than
those who had. better supplies. When they went out to
battle thev were obliged to aHist these people, in one of
which my faithful Spaniard being taken, had like to have
been devoured. They had lost their ammunition, which
rejidrred their fire-arms ufUess; nor could they use the
bows and arrows that were given them, so that while the
armies were at a distance, they had no chance, but when
close, then they could be of service with Jialbcrts, and
-sharpened sticks put into the muzzles of their muskets.
They made themselves targets of wood, covered with the
skins of wild beasts; and when one happened to be knocked
down, the rest of the'company fought ever him till he
recovered: and then standing close in a line, they would
make their way through a thousand savages. At there-
turn of their friend, who they thought had been-entombed
in the bowels of their enemies, their joy was inconceivable.
Nor were they less surprised at the sight of the loaves of
bread 1 hzd sent them, things that they had not seen fer
several years, at the fame time crossing and -blessing it, as
though it was, manila sent from Heaven: but when they
knew the errand, and perceived the ^boat which was to
carry them to tie person and place from whence such re-
lief came, this.st-uck them with such a surprise of joy as
roade some of them faint away, and others burst cat into
tears.
Thio-was the.sum.mary account that 1 had from them.
I stiall raw inform the reader what 1 next did for them,
and in what condition 1 hh them. As we were all of
opinion that the fivages would scarce trouble them any
jj£cre, so we had no 'apprehensions on that fccre. I told
them I was come purely to establish, and not to remove
them; and upon that occasion, had not only brought them
necessaries for convenience and defence, but also artificers,
and other persons, both for their necessary employments,
and to add to their number. They were altogether when I
thus talked to them; and before I delivered to them the
stores I brought, I aslced them one by one, if they had en-
tirely forgot their first animosities, would engage in the
strictest friendship, and shake harass with one another? On
this Wifl Atkins, with abundance of good humour, said,
they had afflictions enough to make them all sober, and
enemies enough to make them all friends: as for himself,
he would live and die among them, owning that what ths
Spaniards had done to him, his own mad humour had made
necessary for them to do. Nor had the Spaniards occa-
sion to justify their proceedings to me; but they told me,
that since Will Atkins had behaved himself so valiantly in
fight, and at other times showed such a regard to the com-
mon interest of them all, they had not only forgotten'all
that was past, but thought he ought as much to be trusted
with arms and necessaries as any of them, which they tes-
tified by making him next in command to the governor:
and they most heartily embraced the occasion of giving me
this solemn assurance, that they would never separate their
interest again as long as they lived.
After these kind declarations of friendship, we appointed
all of us to dine together the next day; upon this I caused
the ship's cock and his mate to come on more for that
purpose, to assist in dressing our dinner. We brought
from the stiipstx pieces of beef, and four of pork,' toge-
ther with our punch-bowl, and materials to fill it; and in
particular I gave them te\i bottles of French claret, and
ten of English beer, which was very acceptable to them.
The Spaniards added to our feast, five who\e kids, which
being roasted, three of them were sent as fresh meat to the
sailors on board, and the other two we ate ourselves. Af-
ter our merry and innocent feast was over, I began to dis-
tribute my cargo among them. First, t gave them linen
sufficient to make tvtry one of them four shirts, and at the
Spaniard's request made them up fix. The thin English
stuffs I allotted to make every one a light coat like^a frock,
agreeable to the climate, and left them such a quantity as
to make more upon their decay; as also pomps, shoes,
hats, and stockings. It is not to be expressed the pleasing
satisfaction which fat upon the countenances of these poor
men, when they perceived what care I took of them, as if
I had been a common father to them all; and they all en-
gaged never to,leave the island, till I gave my consent for
their departure. I then presented to them the people I
brought, viz. the tailor, smith, and the two carpenters;
but my Jack-of-all-trades was the most acceptable present
I could make them. My tailor fell immediately to worlf,
and made every one of them a ihirt; after which, he learn-
ed the women how to few and stitch, thereby to become
the more helpful to their husbands. Neither were the car-
penters less useful, taking in pieces their clumsy things; in-
stead of which they made convenient and handsome tables,
stools, bedsteads, cupboards, lockers, and (helves. But
when 1 carried them to fee Will Atkins's basket-house,
they owned they never saw such a piece of natural inge-
nuity before: " I am sure," said one of the carpenters,
l( the man that built this has no need of us; you need,
"Sir, do nothing but give him tools."
I divided the tools among them in this manner : to every
man I gave a digging spade, a shovel, and a rake, as hav-
ing no harrows or ploughs; and to every separate places
pickax, a crow, a bread ax, and a saw, with a1 store for
a general supply, should any be broken or worn out. I left
them also nails, staples, hinges, hammers, chissels, knives,
scissars,,and all forts cf tools and iron work.; and for the
use of the smith, gave them three tons of unwrought iron,
for a supply; and as to arms and ammunition, I stored
them even to profusion; or, at least, to equip a sufficient
little army against all opposers whatsoever.
The young man (whose mother was unfortunately starved
to ceuh) together with the maid, a pious and well edu-
cated ycung woman, feting things so well ordered on shore
(for 1 made them accompany me) and considering they had
ro occasion to go io far a voyage as to the East Indies,
they both desired of me, that I would leave them there*
and enter them among my subjects. This I readily agreed
to, ordering them a plat of ground, on which were three
little houses erected, environed with basket-Work, pallisa-
doed like Atkins's, and adjoining to his platadon. So
contrived were their tents, that each of them had a room
apart to lodge in, while the middle tent was not only their
store-house, but their place for eating and drinking. At
this iime the two .Englishmen removed tbeir habitation to
their former place i so that now the island was divided info
three colonies: first, Those I hare just now mentioned*!
secondly, That of Will Atkins, where there were four fa-
milies Of Englishmen, with their wives and children, the
widow and her children; the young man and the maid,
who, by the way, we made a wife of before our departure;
three savages, who were slaves; the tailor, smith, (who
served also as a gunsmith) and my other celebrated person
called Jack-of-all-trades. Thirdly, My chief colony, which
consisted of the Spaniards, with Old Friday, who still re-
mained at my old habitation, which was my capital city;
and surely never was there such a metropolis, it now being
hid in so obscure a grove, that a thousand men might have
Tanged the island a month, and looked purposely for it,
without being able to find it, though the Spaniards had
enlarged is boundaries, both without and within, in a most
surprising manner.
But new T think it high time to speak of the young
French priest os the order of St. Benedict, whose judicious
and pious discourses, upon sundry^ occasions merit an ex-
tracrdirfary observation; nor can his being a French PapiS:
priest, 1 presume, give oi&nce to any of my readers, when
they have this assurance from me, that he was.a person of"
the most courteous disposition, extensive charity, and ex-
"alted piety. 'His arguments were always agreeable to rea-
son, and his conversation the most acceptable os any person
that"I had ever yet met with in my life.
"Sir," said he, to me, one day, «' since, under God/*
at the same time crossing his breast, €< ycu have not only
*< saved my list; but/by permitting me to go this voy-
*c age, have granted me the happiness of free converse-
•' lion, I think it my duty, as my profession obliges me, f©
«f save what fouls 1 can, by bringing them to the know-
*' ledge of some Catholic doctrine, necessiry to saltation;
<( and since these people are under your inmedhte go-
*f vernment, in gratitude, justice, and decency, for what
*r you have done for me, 1 (hall offer no farther points in
*f religion, than what mall merit your approbation.*' Be-
ing pleased with the modesty os his Carriage, I told him
he should not be worse used for being of a different per-
fuasion* if upon that very acconnt, we dM not differ in
points of faith, not decent in a part of the country where
the poor Indian* ought to be instructed in the knowledge
fcf the true Gcrd, and his Son Jesus Cnliil. To this ht
OF HOS IN&ON C R UfffE.r I £$
replied, that conversation might easily be separated from
disputes; that he would discourse with me^ rather as a gen~
tleman than a religious •: bat that, if we did enter upon
religious arguments, upon my desiring the fame, I would
give him liberty to defend his own principles. He farther
added, that he wouy do all that became him in his office,
as a priest as well as a Christian, to procure the happiness
of all that were in the ship: that though he could not pray
with, he would pray for us, on all occasions; and then he
told me several extraordinary events of his life, within a
few year? pail:; but particularly in this last, which was the
most remarkable: that, in this voyage, he had the mis-
fortune to be five times shipped and unshipped: bis first:
-design wa> to have gone to Martinico | for which, taking
ship at St. Malos, he was forced into Lisbon by bad wea-
ther, the vessel runmng a-ground in the mouth of the Ta*
gus; that from thence he went on board a Portuguese ship,
bound to the Madeiras, whose master being but an indif-
ferent manner, and out of his reckoning, they were drove
to Fial, where felling their commodity, which was corn,
they resolved to take in their loading at the Isle of May,
and to sail to Newfoundland; at the Banks of which,
meeting a French ship bound to Quebec, in the river of
Canada, and from thence to Martinico, in this (hip he
embarked; the master of which dying at Quebec, that
voyage was suspended; and lastly, stepping himself for
France, this last ship was destroyed by sire, as before has
been related.
At this time we talked no further; but another morn-
ing he comes to me, just as i was going to visit the Eng-
•li'stiman's colony, and tells me, that as he. knew "jt he pros-
perity of the island was my principal desire, he'had fome-
thirfg to communicate agreeable to my design, by which
peHaps he might put it, more than he yet thought it was,
in ihc way of the benediction' of heaven, *< How, Sir?"
said 1 ma surprise, *' are w*e not yet in the way'of God's
blessings, afte'r all these signal providences and deliverances,
of which you have had such an ample relation?" He repli-
ed, ** J hope, Sir, you are in the way, and that your good
design will prosper: but still there are some among you
that are not equally right in their actions; and remember,
I beseech you, Sir, ihat Achan, -by his crinfe, removed
Cod's Welling from the camp of the children of Israel;
lhat though fix and thirty were entirely innocent, yet they
became the objects of divine vengeance, and bore the
weight of his punistiment accordingly." *•-. ,
So sensibly was I touched with this discourse, and ib sa-
tisfied with that ardent piety that inflamed his foul, that I
desired him to accompany me to the Englishmen's plants
tions, which he was very glad of, by season they were the,
subject of what he designed to discourse with me about i
and while we walked on together, he began in the follow-
ing manner: i/f
*' S;r, said he, I ,must confess it as a great unhappinefs
that we disagree in several doctrinal articles of religion.;
but surely both of us acknowledge this, that there is a
•God, who having given us some stated rules for oar ser-
vice and obedience, we ought not willingly and know^
ingly to offend him; either by neglecting what he has
£ )mmanded, or by doing what he has forbidden. This
truth every Chriilian owns, that when any one presump-
tuously sins against God's command, the Almighty then
withdraws his blesting from him; every good man there-
fore ought certainly to prevent such neglect of, or sin
against, God and his commands. I <thanked the young
priest fqr expressing so great a concern for us, and desired
him to explain the parriculars of what he had observed,
that according to the parable of Achan, I «' might remove
the accursed thing from among us." Why then, Sir,
said he, in the first place, you have four Englishmen, who
have taken savage women to their wives, by whom they
have several children, though none of them are legally
married, as the law of God and man requires; they, J
fay, Sir, are no less than adulterers, and as they still live
in adultery, are liable to the curie of God. I know, Sir.,
you may object the wan£ of a priest, or clergyman of any
kind; as also, pen, ink, and pap.r, to write dawn a con^
tract of marriage, and have it signed between them. But
i.either this, nor what the Spaniih governor has told you,.
of their choosing by consent, can be reckoned a marriage,
nor anv more than an agreement to keep them from quar-
relling among themselves; for, Sir, the esience or sacra-
ment of matrimony (so he called it) not only consists in
rrutual consent, bat in thejegal obligation, which compels
them to own arvd acknowledge one at.-other, to abstain from
other persons, the men to provide ior their, wives and,
children, and the women to the fame and like conditions,
mutatis mutandis, on their £de.: whereas^ Sir, these meiu
cer fc o'tito sd h &k t? soe , 19j
ti^on"tMir'OWn j^casore, on any occasion, may forsake
those women, and marry others, and by disowning their
children/ suffer them utterly to perifu." "Now, Sir/'
added-he/ •* can God be honoured in such an unlawful li-
berty as this ( how C3n a blessing succeed to the best endea-
vours, if men are allowed to live in so licentious a way?" I
Vfz^ indeed struck with the thing myself, and thought that
they were much to blame, that no forma! contract had been
made, though it had i>een but breaking a stick between
them, to engage them to live as man and wife, never to
separate, but love, cherish, and comfort one another all
their lives;" *< yet, Sir," said I, "when they took these
women, I was not here, and if k is adultery, it is past my
remedy, and I cannot help it." te True, Sir>" answered
the young priest, '« you cannot be charged with that part
of the crime which was done in your aofence: but I be-
seech you, don't flatter yourself, that you are under no
obligation now to pot a period to it : which if you neglect
to do, the guilt will be entirely on you alone, since it is
certainly in nobody's power but yours, to alter their con-
dition." I must confess, I was so dull, that I thought he
meant I should part them, and knowing that this would
put the whole island in confusion, i told him I could not
consent to it upon any account whatsoever *' Sir," said
h^, in a great surprise, «• I do not mean that you should
separate, but marry them, by a written contract, signed
by both man and woman, and by all the witnesses present,
which all the European laws decree to be of sufficient ef-
ficacy." Amafeed with such true piety and sincerity, and
considering the validity of a written contract, 1 acknow-
ledged all that he said to be very just and kind, and that
I would discourse with the men about it; neither could I
fee: what reason they-could have not to let him marry
thtms whose authority in that affair is owned to be as au-
thentic as if they were married by any of our clergymen in
England.
'Thenrext complaint he had to mate to me was this, that
thorcrgh these Englisti subjects of mine have lived with these
w^men seven years, and though they were of good un-
derstanding, and capable of instruction, having learned
not only to speak, but to read English, yet all this while
they had never taught them any thing of the Christian re-
ligion, or the knowledge of God, much less in what man-
ner hecught to be served. "And is not this an unaccount-
I 2
able neglect?" said he warmly. t( Depend upon it, God
Almighty uill call them to account for such contempt.
And thouch I am not of your religion, yet I mould be
glad to see these people released from the deviFs powerf
and be saw d by the principles of the Christian religion,
the knowledge of God, of a Redeemer, the resurrection,,
and of a future state. But as it is not too late, if you please
to give me leave to instruct them, I doubt not but I shall
supply this great defect, by bringing them into the great
circle of Christianity, even while you continue in the
istand."
 I could hold no longer, but embracing him, told him,
with a thousand thanks, I would grant whatever he re-,
quested, arid desired him to proceed in the third article,
which he did in the following manner:
"Sir," said he, ** it should be a maxim among all Chri-
Hians, that Christian knowledge ought to be propa-
gated by all possible means, and on all occasion?. Upon
this account out church fends missionaries into Persia, In-
dia, and China, men who are willing to die for the fake
of Gcd and the Christian faith, in order to bring poor in*
fidels into the way of salvation. Now, Sir, as here is an
opportunity to convert seven and -thirty poor savages, I
wonder how you can pass by such an occasion of doing
gcod* which is really worth the expente of a man's whole
life,"
I must confess I was so confounded a»t this discourse, that
I coud not tell how to answer him. '* Sir," said he, seeing
me ir disorder, *' I shall be very sorry is I have given yoa
offence;" 'No, Sir/' said I, *' I am rather confounded;
.and^you know my cii cum stances, that being bound to the
East Indies in a merchant ship, I cannot wj-ong the own-
ers so much, as to detain the ship here, the men lying at
victuals and wages on their account, ff J stay above
twelve days, J rou$ pay 3I. steiling per Jim demurrage,
©or must the ship stop above fi^ht days more; so that f
am enable to engage m this work, unless I would leave
the stiip, and be reduced to my former condition." ,Tlie
priest, though he owned this was hard upon me, yet laid
it to m> conscience, whether the bieÆng of saving seven
and thirty souls was not worth venturing all that^ 1 had la
the world i" "Sir," said I, * * it is very true; Biotas you are
an ecclesiastic, it naturally falls into your profeijipo ;#whyf.
.therefore* don't you*rather ofier to pndeuai^e k youzku,
x& ROiBiNscm cruso>e» 197
than press me to it?'" upon this be turned about, making
a very low bow, " I most humbly thank God and you, Sir,
(said he) for so blessed a call; aud most willingly under-
take so glorious an office,,which, will fuffi iently compen-
sate all the hazards and difficulties I have gpne through in
a long and uncomfortable voyage/*
While he was thus speaking, I could discover a rapture
in his face, by his colour going and coming; at the sams
time his eyes sparkled like fire, and all the signs of* the
most zealous transports. And when I asked whether he was
in earnest?" Sir," said he, "it was to preach to the In-
dians I consented to come along with you; these insidds,
even in this little island, are infinitely of .nore wortft than
my poor life: if so that I mould prove the happy instru-
ment of saving these poor creatures' foul?, I care not if I
never fee my native country again. One thing i only beg
of you more is, that you would leave Friday with me,
to i>e my interpreter, without whose assistance neither of
us will understand each other."
This request very sensibly troubled me; first, upon Fri-
day's being bred a Protestant; and, secondly, for the af-
fection I bore to him for his fidelity: Bar, immediately
the remembrance of Friday's father coming into my head,
"I recommended him to him as having learned'Spanish,
which, the priest also understood; and fa was thoroughly
"satisfied with him.
When we came to the Englishmen, after 1 had told them
what necessary things I had done for them, I talked to them
of the scandalous life they led, told them what notice the
clergymen had taken of it, and asked them if they were
married men or bachelors? They answered, two of them
"were widowers, and the other three single men. But, said
I, with what conscience can you call these your wives, by
whom you have so many children, and yet are not lawfully
married? They all said, that they took them before the
governor as such, having nobody else to marry them, which
they thought as legal, as if they had had a parson. No
doubt, said I, but in the eye of God it is so: but unless I
am assured of your honest intent, never to desert these
poor creatures, I can do nothing more for you, neither can
you expect God's blessing while you live in such an open
course of adultery. Hereupon, Will Atkins, who spoke
for tKe rel, told me, That they believed their wives the
most innocent and virtuous creatures in the world; that
U98 LIF fr A N D A WEN T V R E%
they would never forsake them wbile they had breath; $fc<L
that, if there was a clergyman in the ship, they would be
married to them with all their hearts, I told you before,
said I, that I have a minister with me, who (hall marry you
to-merrow meriting, if you are willing; so I would have
> oa consult to-night with the rest about it. I told him the
clergyman was a Frenchman, and knew not a word of Eng-
lish, but that I would act as ckrk between ihem. And
indeed this business met with such fpzedy success, that they
al! told me, in a few minutfs after,, that they were ready
to be formally married, as soon as I pleased ; with which
inf rung the priest, he was exceedingly rejoiced.
Nothing new remained, but that she women should be
made sensible of the meaning of the thing; with which be-
ing well satisfied, they with thrir husbands attended at my
apartment the next morning; there was my priest, habited
in a black vest, something like a cassock, with a fasti round
it, much resembling a minister, and I was his interpreter.
But the seriousness of his behaviour, and the scruples he
made of marrying the women, u h 3 were not baptized, gave
ther an exceeding reverence for his person: nor indeed
would he marry them at all, till he obtained my liberty to
discourse both with the men and women, and then he told
thejp, That in the sight of all indifferent men, and in the
ser.se of the laws of society, they had lived in open adul-
tery, which nothing now, but their consent to marry, or
final separation, could put an end to; and even here was a
difficulty with respect to the laws of Christian matrimony,
in marrying a professed Christian to a heathen idolater, un-
baptized; but jet there was time enough to make them
profeis the name of Christ, without which nothing could
be done; that, besides, he believed themselves very indif-
ferent Christians; and consequently had not discoursed with
their wives upon that subject; and that unless they pro-
mised him to do so, he could not marry them, as being ex-
pressly forbidden by the laws of God.
All this they heard attentively, and owned readily.
«• But, Lord, Sir," said Will Atkins to me, " bow
should we teach them religion, who know nothing of it
ourselves? How can we talk to our wives of God, jesus
Christ, heaven and hell? why they would only laugh at tpsf
who never yet havepractised religion, but on the contrary
all manner of wickedness" "Will Atkins/' (aid I, « can-
aot you tell your wife (he is in the wrong, and that her gods
are idols, which can neither speak nor understand; but thai
0*|r God* who has juade, can destroy al! things; that he
rewards the good and punishes the wicked; and at last will:
Wing us to judgment; cannot you tell her these things r"
'* That's true," said Atkins, " but then (he'll tell me it i*
utterly false, since I am not puniihed and sent to the devil*
who: hath been such a wicked creature.'' These words I
interpreted to the priest fs O !" said he,« tell him, his re-
pentance will make him a very good minister to his spouse,
and qualify him to preach on the mercy and lor. g-suffering
of a merciful Being, who desires not the death of a sinner,
and even defers damnation to the last judgment; this will
lead him tathe doctrine of the resurrection, and will make
him an excellent preacher to his wife." I repeated this to
Atkins, who being more than ordinary affected with it,
replied, (t J know all this, Sir, and a great deal more;
but hew can I have the impudence to talk thus to my
wife, when my conscience witnesses against me ?" (f Alas i"
said he (with tears in his eye, and giving a great sigh)
•' as for repenting, that is for ever past me,'* "Pait
you! Atkins," said I, « what do you mean?" "You
know v^ell enough," said he, '* what I mean; I mean it
is too late."
When I told the priest what he said, thepocr affectionate
man could not refrain from weeping; but recovering him-
self, tf Pray, Sir," said he, "ask him if he is contented
that it is too late; or is he concerned, and wiihes it were
not so r" This question I put fairly to Atkins, who replied
in a passion, " How can 1 be easy in a state which I know
must terminate in my ruin ? for 1 really believe, some time
or other, 1 stiajl cut my throat, to put a period both to my
life., and to the terrors of my conscience."
. At this the clergyman (hook his head, t€ S*r," said he,
*• pray tell.him it is not too late; Chr'i! will give him re-
pentance, if he has recourse to the merit of his passion.
Does he think he is beyond the power of Divine Mercy?
There m?y indeed be a time when provoked mercy will no
longer strive, but never too late for men to repent in this
world." [ told Atkins every wosd the priest had said, who
then parted from us to walk with his v*ife, while we d:s-
coursed .with the rest. But these were very stupid in reli-
gious matters; yet all of them promised to do their endea-
vours to make their wives turn Chrsstians,; and upon which
promises the priest married the three couple. But as At-
kins was the only sincere convert, and of more fense tha&
the rest, my clergyman was earnestly inquiring' after him:
"Sir," said he, t( let us walk out of this labyrinth, and I
dare fay we (hall find this poor man preaching to his wife
already." And indeed we found it true; ibr coming to
ibe tdge of the wood, we perceived Atkins and his savage
wise sitting under the shade of a bush, in very earnest dis-
course; he pointed to the sun, to the quarters of the earth,
to himself, to her, the woods, and the trees. Immediately
we cculd perceive him start upon his feet, fall down upon
his knees, and lift up both his hands; at which the tea^s
ran down my clergymen's cheeks; bat our great misfor-
tune was, we could not hear one word that passed between
them. Another time he would embrace her, wiping the
tears from her eyes, kissing her with the greatest transports,
and then both kneel down for some minutes together.
Such raptures of joy did this occasion in* my young priest,
that he cculd scarcely contain himself: And a little aster
this, we observed by her motion, as frequently lifting up
her hands, and laying them on her breast, that (he was
mightily affected with his discourse, and so they withdrew
from our sight.
When we came back, we found them botih waiting to be
called in; upon which he agreed to examine him alone,
and so I began thus to discourse him. '* Prithee, Will
.Atkins," said I, ** what education have you? What was
your father?
W. A. A better man than ever I shall be; he was, Sir,
a clergyman, who gave me good instruction, Or correction,
which I despised, like a brute as I was, and murdered my
poor rather.
Pr. Ha! a murderer!
. [Here the Prieji Jiarted and leaked sale, as thinking he had
really killed bis father.]
R C. What, did you kill him with your hands?
W. A. No, Sir, I cut not his throat, but broke his
heart by the most unnatural tarn of disobedience to the
tenderest and best of fathers.
R C. Well, I pray God grant you repentance: I did
not ask you to extort a confession ; but I asked you because
I see you have more knowledge of what is good than your
companions.
IV. A. O Sir, whenever I look back upon my pauMife,
conscience upbraids me with my father; the sins against
fjf K 011K SOT* C*R XTSO S • 20 f
our parents make the deepest wounds, and their weight lies
the heaviest upon the mind.
R. C. You talk, Will, too feelingly and sensibly for me;
I am not able to bear it.
W, A. You bear it, Sir! you know nothing of it.
R. C. But yes, Atkins, I do; and every shore, valley,
and tree in this island, witness the anguish of my foul for
my undutifulness to my kind father, whom I have murder-
ed likewise; yet my repentance falls infinitely short of
yours. But, Will, how comes the fense of this matter to
touch you just now?
W. A. Sir, the work you have set me about, has occa-
sioned it's for talking to my wife about God and religion,
she has preached me such a sermon, that I shall retain it
in lasting remembrance.
R. C. No, no, it is your own moving pious arguments
to her, has made conscience fling them back upon you.
But pray, Atkins, inform us what passed between you and
your wife, and in what manner did you begin.
W. A. I talked to her of the laws of marriage, the rea-
son of such compacts, whereby order and justice is main-
tained; without which men would run from their wives
'and children, to the dissolution of families or inheritances*
R. C. Well, and what did (he fay to all this?
W.A. Sir, we began our discourse in the following man-
ner, which I shall exactly repeat according to my mean ca-
pacity, If you think it worth your while to honour it with
your attention.
The DIALOGUE between Will Atkins and his Wife in the

Here the poor man fell upon his knees, and made her
tneci down by him, praying with the greatest fervency
16.
that God would instruct her by his Holy Spirit; and that
God by his providence would fend them a Bible for both
their instructions. And such was the early piety of this
new convert, that (he made him promise never to forsake
God any more, lest, being made dead, as she called it, she
should not only want her instructor, but himself be miser-
able m a long eternity.
Such a surprising account as this was, proved very af-
fecting to us both, but particularly to the young clergy-
man, who was mightily concerned he could not talk to her
himself. "Sir, said he, "there is something more to
be done to this woman than to marry her: I mean that
she ought to be baptized." To this I presently agreed:
"Pray," said he, " a(k her husband, whether he has ever
talked to her of Jesus Christ, the salvation of sinners, the
nature of faith, and redemption in and by him, of the Holy
Spiiit, the resurrection, last judgmer t, and a suture state;"
but the poor fellow melted into tears at this question, say-
ing, that he had said something to her of these things, but
his inability to talk of them, made him afraid, lest her
knowledge of them should rather make her contemn reli-
gion, than he benefited by it ; but that if I would discourse
with her, it would be very evident my labour would not be
in vain. Accordingly I called her in, and placing myself
as interpreter between the religious priest and the woman,
I intreated him to go on; but surely r.ever was such a ser-
mon preached by any clergyman in these latter days,
with so much zeal, knowledge, and sincerity; in short,.
he brought the woman to err;brae? the knowledge of
Christ, and of redemption by him, with so su.pjifing a de-
gree of understanding., that she made it her own request
to be baptiztd.
He then performed his office in the sacrament of baptism,
first, by spying some words over to himself in Latin, and
then asking me to give her a name, as being her godfather,
and pouring a whole dish-full of water upon the woman's
head, he said, "Mary, I baptize thee in the name of the
Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost;" so that
rone could know of what religion he was. After this he
pronounced the benediction in Latin. Thus the woman
being made a Christian, he married her to Will Atkins;
which being finished, he affectionately exhorted him to
lead a holy life for the future; and since the Almighty,
fen* the convictions of his conscience, had honoured him-
to be the instrument of his wife's converiion, he should
not dishonour the grace of God, that while the savage was
converted, the instrument should'be cast away. Thus end-
ed a ceremony, to me the most pleasant and agreeable I
ever passed in my life.
The affairs of the island being settled, I was preparing
to go on board* when the young man (whose mother was
starved) came to me, faying., that as he understood I had
a clergyman with me, who had married the Englishmen
with savages, he had a match to make between two Christ-
ians, which he desired might be finished before I de-
parted. Thinking that it was he himself that had courted
his mother's maid, I persuaded him not to do any thing
rashly upon the account of his solitary ciicumstances; that
the maid was an unequal match for him, both in respect
to substance and years; and that it was very probable he
would live to return to his own country, where he might
have a far better choice. At these words, smiling, he
interrupted me, thanking me for my good advice; thast
as he had nothing to beg of me but a small settlement,
with a servant or two, or some new necessaries, so he
hoped I would not be unmindful of him when I returned
to England, but give his letter to his friends; and that
when he was redeemed, the plantation, and all its im-
provements, however valuable, fhou-ld be returned to me
again. But as for the marriage he proposed, that it was
not himself, but that it was between my Jack-of-all-trades
and the maid Susan.
I was indeed agreeably surprised at the mentioning this
match, which seemed very suitable, the one being a very
ingenious fellow, and the other an excellent, dexterous,
and sensible housewife, sit to be governess of the whole
island; so we married them the fame day; and as I was
her father, and gave her away, so I gave her a handsome
portion, appointing her and her husband a convenient
large space of ground for their plantation. The sharing
out of the land I left to Will Atkins, who really divided
it very justly, to every person's satisfaction; they only
desired one general writing under my hand for the whole,
which I caused to be drawn up, signed, and sealed to
them, setting out their bounds, and giving them a right
to the whole possession of their respective plantations, with
their improvements, to them and their heirs, reserving all
* the rest of the island as my own property, and a certain
tent for every particular plantation, after eleven years.
zqS life.asd AtrmvzvKis
As so their laws and government/! exhorted themtofo^e
one another; and as to the Imiians who lived ina nook by
themselves, I allotted three or four of them plantations,
and the rest willingly chose to become servants to the oth^r
families, by which means they were employed in useful la-
bour, and fared much better than they did before. Be-
sides the savages being thus mixed with the Christians,,
the work of their conversion might be set on foot by the
latter, in the clergyman's absence, to our equal satisfaction.
The young priest, however, was a little anxious lest the
Christians mould not be willing to do their parts in in-
structing these poor Indians; 1 therefore told him we should
call them all together; that he should speak to the Spaniards
who were Papists, and I to the English who were Protestants,
and make them promise that they would never make any
distinction in religion, but teach the general true know-
ledge of God, and his Son. Jesus Christ, in order to con-
vert the poor savages. And this, indeed, they all pro-
mised us accordingly.
When I. came to Will Atkins's house, I found his bap-
tised wife, and the young woman newly married to my
Jack»of-alUtrades, were become great intimates, and dis-
coursing of reiigicn together. "O, Sir," says Will A;kks,
*• when God has sinners to reconcile to himself, he never
wants an instructor; I knew I was unworthy of so good a
work, and therefore this young woman has been sent hi-
ther as it were from heaven, who is sufficient to convert a
whole nation of savages." The young woman blushed, and
was going to rife; but I desired her to fit still-, and hoped
that God would bless her in so good a work; and then pul-
ling out a Bible (which I brought on purpose in my packet
for him.) ".Here, Atkins," said 1 " here is an assistant tfeat
perhaps you had hot before." So confounded was the.po-ur*
man, that it was some time before he coiijd speak; at la#,
turning to his wife, (i My dear," he said, " did I not tell
you that God could hear what we said? ~ Here's the
book I\ prayed for, when you and I kneeled under the bush:
God then heard us, and now has sent it." The woman
was surprised, and thought really God had sent that indi-
vidual book from heaven; but I turned to the yonng wo-
man, and desired her to explain to. the young crmvert, tfr#t
God may properly be said to answer our petitions, whe*j»
in the course of his providence, such particular things
came to pass as we petitioned for. This the yoking w$*
or no&iKsoN Crusoe. 207
jnan did -effectually5 but surely Will AtkinsU joy cannot
*be expressed ; no man being more thankful for any thing
in the world, than he was for his Bible, nor desired it
from a better principle.
After several religious discourses, I desired the young
woman to give me an account of the anguish she felt when
(he was starving to death with hunger; to which she rea-
dily consented, and began in the following manner:
 Sir," said she, "all our victuals being gone, after I
had fasted one day, my stomach was very sickly, and, at
the approach of night, 1 was inclined to yawning and
sleepy. When I slept upon the couch three hours, 1 awak-
ed a little refreshed: three hours after, my stomach being
more and more sickly, 1 lay down again, but could not
sleep, being very faint and ill. Thus I passed the second
day with a strange variety, sirst hungry, then sick again,
with Teachings to vomit: that night I dreamed I was at
Barbadoes, buying plenty of provisions, and dined hearti-
ly. But when I awaked, my spirits were exceedingly
funk, to find myself in the extremity of famine. There
was but one glass of wine, which being mixed with sugar,
I drank up; but for want of sub'Aance to digest upon, the
fumes of it got into my head, and made me senseless for
some time. The third day I was so ravenous and-furious,
that I could have eaten a little child if it had come in my.
way; during which time, I was as mad as any creature in
Bedlam. In one of these fits 1 fell down, and struck my
face against the corner of a pallet-bed, where my mistress
lay; the blood gusiied out of my nose, but by my exces-
sive bleeding, both the violence of the fever, and the ra-
venous part of the hunger abated. After this, I grew sick
'again, strove to vomit, but could not; then bleeding a se-
cond time, I swooned away as dead; when I came to my-
self, I had a dreadful gnawing pain in my stomacn, which
Went of towards night, with a longing deiirt for food.
I took a draught of water and sugar, .but it came up again;
then I drank water without sugar, and that staid with me.
T laid rae^lown on the bed, praying God would take me
away: after I had slumbered, i thought myself a-dying,
therefore recommended my foul to Gjd, and wished some-
body would throw me into the sea. AU this while my de-
« parting mistress lay by me; the last bit of bread she had,
Jihe gave to her dear child, my young master. Themom-
-ifrg after, I fell/into a violent passion of crying, and afer
that Into hanges. I espied the frtodd that camfe from frir
UfOse in a bason, which f immediately'swallowed up. Ac
night I had the usual variations, as the pain in the sto-
mach, sick, sleepy, and ravenous; and I had no thought
butt that I mould die before morning. In the morning
came On terrible gripings in my bowels. At this time I
-heard my young master's lamentations, by which I under-
stood his mother was dead. Soon after this, the sailors
cried, " A sail t A sail!" halloing as if they were dis-
tracted for joy of that relief, which afterwards we received
from your hands."
- Surely never was a more distinct account of starving to
death than this. But to return to the disposition of things
among my people, I did not take any notice to them of
the sloop that I had framed, neither would I leave them
the two pieces of brass cannon, or the two quarter deck guns
that'I had on board, lest, upon any disgust, they should
have separated, or turned pirates, and so made the island a
den of thieves, instead of a plantation of.sober pious peo-
ple: but leaving them in a flourishing condition, with a
-promise, to send them further relief from Brazil, as sheep,
hogs, and cows (being dbliged to kill the latter at sea, ha-
ving no hay to feed them) I went onboard the ship again,
the first of May, 1695, after having been twenty days
among them; and next morning, giving them a salute of
five guns at parting, we set sail for the Brazils. The third
day, towards evening, there happening a calm, and the
current being very strong, we were drove to the N. N. E.
-towards the land. Some hours after, we perceived the sea
covered as it were with something very black, not easily at
first to be discovered : upon which our chief mate ascending
the shrouds a little way, and taking a view with a perspective
glass, he cries out, " An army 1 An army 1" " you fool,"
•said I, "what do you mean •?" "Nay, Sir," said hi,
•«« don't be angry, I assure you, it is not only an army, bura
sleet too, for 1 believe there area thousand canoes paddling
along, and making with great haste towards* us."
Indeed every one of us were surprised at this relation;
and my nephew the captain could not tell what to think of
it, but thought we stiould all be devoured: Nor was I
free from concern, when I considered how much we we=r*e
becalmed, and what a strong current set towards the shore;
however, I encouraged him not to be afraid, but brin-j
the ship to an anchor, as soon as we were certain that we
'OT RO-B-INSaN-.cKirsac* to£
must engage them. Accordingly we did so, and surfed ail
our sails; as to the savages we seared nothing, but only thai
they might set the ship on fire; to prevent which, I or-
dered them to get their boats out, and fasten them, one close
by the head, and the other by the stern, well manned, with
fkeets and buckets to extinguish the flames, mould it so
happen. The savages soon came up with us, but there
were rot so many as the mate had said, for instead os a
thousand canoes there were only one hundred and twenty;
too many indeed for us, several os their canoes containing
about sixteen or seventeen men.
As they approached us, they seemed to be in the great-
est amazement, not knowing what to make os us. They
rowed round the ship, which occasioned us to call to the
men in the boats, nor to suffer them to come near them*
Hereupon they beckoned to the savages to keep back,
which thzy accordingly cid; but at their retreat they let
fly about fifty arrows among us, and very much wounded
one cf cur men in the long-boat- 1 called to them not to
fire upon any account, but handing them down some deal
boards, the carpenters made them a kind of fence to shield
therr. from the arrows. In half an hour after they came
so near astern of us, that we had a perfect sight of them;
then they rowed a little farther out, till they came directly
along-side os us, and then approached so near, that they
could hear us speak: this made me order all our men to
keep close, and get their guns ready. In the mean time I
ordered Friday to go out upon deck, and ask them in his
language what they meant No sooner did he do so, but
six of i he savages, who were in the foremost canoes, stoop-
ing down, showed us their naked backsides, as much as to
fay in Engiisti, Kiss our :but Friday quickly knew
what this meant, by immediaiely crying ©ut they were
going to shoot; unfortunately for him, poor creature, who
fell under the cloud of three handled arrows, no less than
seven piercing through his body, killing one cf the best
servants, and faithfullest of companions in all my solitudes
and afflictions.
So enraged was I at the death of poor Friday, that the
guns, which before were charged only with powder, to
frighten them, I ordered to be loaded with small shot;
nor did the gunners fail in their aim, but at this broad,
side split and overset thirteen or fourteen of their canoes,
which killed numbers of them, and set the rest a swim-
ming: the others, frightened oat of their writs,; Kttfeare"-
garding their fellows drowning, scoured away as fast is
they could. One poor wretch our people took up, swim-
ming for his life, an hourafterv He was very itsUen at
firfr, so that he would neither eat rtor speak; btit I tsockaa,
way to cure him, by ordering them to throw him into.-the
sea, which they did, and then he came swimming back
like a cork, calling in his toftgue, asIAippofe, tosave him;
So we tcok him on board, but it was a long time before
we could make him speak or understand English; yet
when we had^u«ght him, he told us, they; were going'with
their kings to fight a great battle y and when we asked
him, what made them come up to us? he said,4* to makes
de great wonder look g* where it is to be noted* that those
natives, and those of Africa, always add two ^i at
the end of English words, as makee, tœfoe, and the like,
from which it is a very difficult thing to make them break
 ©«.
Being now under fail, we took our last farewel of peer
honest Friday, and interred him with all possible decency
and solemnity, putting him in a coffin, and eommi-tirg
him to the deep, at the same time causing eleven guns 10
be fired at him. Thus ended the life of one of the most
grateful, faithful, honest, and affectionate servants, that
ever any man was blessed with in the world* -
Having now a fair wkid for Brazis, in about twelve days
time we made land in the latitude pf five degrees south-of
the line. Four days we kept on S.by E. in sight of shore,
when wc.made Cape St. Augustin, and in three days v, e
came up to an anch r «ss the Bay of All Saints* 1 had
great difficulty here to get leave to hold correspondence vn.
shore; for neither the figure of my partner, my two mer-
chant trustees, nor the fame of my wonderful preserva-
tion in the island, could procure me the favour, till ssch
time as the prior of the monastery of the August in es (to
whom I had given 500 moidores) obtained leave from the
Governor, for me personally, with the Captain and one
more, together with eight sailors, to come on shore; upon
(his condition, that we should not land any goods: out ?of

meattv worth about thirty moidores, including some to*

r Here I delivered my partner in goods to the value of
i ct>i; fferliag, and obliged him to fit up the sloop 1 bought
for the use of my island, in order to send them refreshments;
and f© active was he in this matter, that he had the vessel
Crushed m a lew days, to the mailer of which I gave par-
ticular instructions to find the place. I scon loaded him
with a small cargo; and one of oar sailors offered to fettle
there, upon my letter to the Spanish governor, if I would
allot him tools and a plantation. This I willingly granted,
and gave him the savage we had taken prisoner to be his
Save. All things being ready for the voyage, my old.
partner told me there was an acquaintance of his, a Brazil
^planter, who having fallen under the displeasure of the
church, and in fear of the Inquisition, which obliged him
to be concealed, would be glad of such an opportunity to
make his escape, with his wife and two daughters; and if
I would allot them a plantation in my island, he would give
them a small stock to begin with, for that the officers had
already seized his effects and estate,, and left him nothing
but a little household stuff and two slaves. This request
I presently granted, concealing him and his family on board
our ship, till such tirr e as the ilcop (where all the effects
were) was gone out of the bay, and tlun we put them on
board, who carried some materials, and plants for plant-
ing sugar-canes, aleng with them. By this sloop, among
other things, I sent ray subjects three milch cows and five
calves, about zi hogs, three sows big with pig, two mares
and a stune horse. I also engaged three Portugal women
to go for sake of the Spaniards, which, w:.th the persecuted
man's tuo daughters, were sufficient, since the rest had
wives of their own, though in another country; all which
cargo arrived safe, no doubt to their exceeding comfort,
who, with this addition, Were about sixty or seventy peo-
ple, besides children.
At this place, my truly honest and pious clergyman left
me; for a ship being ready to set fail for Liibon, he a&ed
'me leave to go thither; but f allure you, it was with th&
i greatest reluctance I parted from a person, whose virtae
and piety merited the greatest esteem. '".
from the Brazils, we macre directly over the Atlantic
Ocean to the Cape of Good Hope, having a tolerable
good Voyage, steering for the most part S. E. , We wete
on a trading voyage, and had a supercargo on board, who
was to direct all the ship's motions after stie arrived at the
Cape, only being limited to a certain number of days, for*
stay, by charter party, at the several ports she was to go to.
At the Cape we only took in fresh water, and then failed
for the coast of Coromandel; we were there informed,
that a French man of war of 50 guns, and two large mer-
chant ships, were sailed for the Indies, but we heard no
more of them.
In our passage, we touched at the island of Madagas-
car, where, though the inhabitants are naturally fierce and
treacherous, and go constantly armed with bows and lan-
ces, yet for some time they treated us civily enough; and,
in exchange for knives, seiifars, and other trifles, they
brought us eleven good fat bullocks, which we took partly
for present victuals, and the remainder to salt fer the ihip's
use.
So curious was 1 to view every corner of the world
where 1 came to, that I went on shore as often as f could.
Gne evening when on shore, we observed numbers of the
people stand gazing at us at a distance. We thought our-
selves in no danger, as they had hitherto used as kindly.
However, we cut three boughs out of a tree, sticking
them at a distance from us, which it seems, in that coun-
try, is not only a token of truce aud amity, but when
poles or boughs are set up on the other side, it is a sign the
truce is accepted. In these treaties, however, there is one
principal thing to be regarded, that neither party corce
beyond one another's three poles or boughs; so that the
middle space is not only secure, but is also allowed as a
market for traffic and Commerce. When the truce is thus
accepted, they stick up their javelins and lances at the first
poles, and come on unarmed; but if any violence is of-
fered, away they run to their,poles, take up their wea-
pons, and then the truce is at an end. This evening it
happened that a greater number of people than usual, both
men and women, traded among us for such toys as we
had, with such great civility, that we made us a little tenr,
of large boughs of trees, iome of the men resolving to He
on shore all night; but, for my part, I and some others
took our lodging in the boat, with boughs of trees spread
over it, having a sail spread at the bottom to lie upon.
About two o'clock in the morning we were awakened by
the firing of muikets, ami our men crying out for help, or
dse they would all be muedered. Scarce had we time to
get the boat ashore, when our men came plunging them-
selves into the water, with about four hundred of the
islanders at their heels. We took up seven of the men,
three of them very much wounded, and one left behind
killed, while the enemy poured their arrows so thick among;
us, that we were forced to make a barricado, with boards
l)ing at the side of the boat, to shield us from danger;
and, having got ready our fire-arms, we returned them a
volley, which wounded several of them, as we could hear
b./ their cries. In this condition we lay till break of day*
and then making signals of distress to the ship, which my
nephew the captain neard and understood, he weighed an-
chor, and stood as near, the shore as possible, and then sent
another boat with ten hands in her to assist us; but we
called to them not to come near, informing them of our
unhappy condition. However they ventured; when one
of tne men taking'the end of a tow-line in one hand, and
keeping our beat between him and our adversaries, swam to
us, and slipping our cables, they towed us out of reach
of their arrows, and quickly after a broad-ftde was given
them from the ship, which made a most dreadful havoc
among them. When we got on board, we examined into
the occasion of this fray. The men who sled informed us/
that an old woman, who fold milk within the poles, had
brought a young woman with her, who carried roots or
kerbs, the sight of whom so much tempted our men, that
they effered rudeness to the maid, at which the old wo-
man set up a great cry; nor would the sailors part with
the prize, but carried her among the trees, while the old wo-
man went, and brought a whole army down upon them.
At the beginning of the attack, one of our men was killed
with a lance a d the fedow who began the mischief, paid
dear enough for his mistress, though as yet we did not
knew what had become of him; the rest luckily cicaped.
The third r.ieht after the Eclion,. being curious to under-
stand how sflails stood, i took the supercargo and twenty
stout fellows with me, ar.d landsd about two houis before
midnight, at the fame place where those Indians stood the
night before, and there we divided our men into two bo-
dies, the boatswain commanding one, and I another. It
* was io dark, that we could fee nobody, neither did we hear
any voice near us: but by and by the boatswain falling
over a dead body, we agreed to bait till the moon should

rife, which he knew would be in an hour after. ifosjjfcv
ceived here no fewer than- two and thirty bodies upon thef
ground, whereof two were not quite dead. Satisfied with
this discovery, I was for going on board again; but the
boatswain and the rest told me, they would make a visit to
the Indian town, where these dogs, so they called them,
resided, asking me at the fame time to go along with them;
for they did not doubt, besides getting a good booty, but
they mould find Tom JefFery there, for that was the un-
happy man we missed. But I utterly refused to go, and
commanded them back, being unwilling to hazard their
lives, as the safety of the (hip wholly depended upon them.
Notwithstanding all I could say to them, they all left me
but one, and the^supercargo; so we three returned to the
boat, where a boy was left, resolving to stay till they re-
turned. At parting I told them I supposed most of them
would run the same fate with Tom JefFery. To this they
replied, "Come boys, come along, we'll warrant we'll
come oiF safe enough f* and so away they went, notwith-
standing all my admonitions, either concerning their own
safety or the preservation of the ship. Indeed, they were
gallantly armed, every man having a musket, bayonet, and
a pistol, besides cutl'sses, hangers, pole-axes, aird hand
granades. They came to a few Indian houses at siift,
which not being the town they expected, they went farther,
and finding a cow tiedto a tree, they concluded that she
would be a sufficient guide, and so it proved; far, after
they untied her, Aie led them directly to the town, which
consisted os above two hundred houses, several families liv-
ing in some of the huts together. At their arrival, all be-
ing in a profound sleep, the sailors agreed to divide them-
selves into three bodies, and set three parts of the town on
fire at once, to kill those that were escaping, and plunder
the rest of the houses. Thus desperately resolved, they
went to woik; but the sirst party had not gone far. before
they called out to the rest, that they had found Tom Jef-
fery ; 'whereupon they all ran up to the place, and found
the poor fellow indeed hanging up naked by one arm, and
his throat almost cut from ear to ear. in a house that was
hard by the tree, they found sixteen or seventeen Indian*,
who had been concerned in the fray, two or three"Crf them
being wounded, were not gone to steep: this house
they set-on fire first, and in a few mitrutes after, five or fix
places more in the town appeared in flames. The confla-
•Ct* »0B*N SO N C R U &Q Z* £ IJ
£ ration spread like wild-fire, their houses being all of wood,
aud covered with stags or rushes. The poor affrighted in-
habitants endeavoured to run out to save their lives, but
they were driven back into the flames by the sailors, and
killed without mercy. At the first house above mentioned,
after the boatswain had slain two with his pole-ax, he
threw a hand-gradado into the house, which bursting,
made a terrible havock, killing and wounding most of
them i and their king and most of his train, who were then
in that house, fell victims to their fury, every creature of
them being either smothered or burnt. All this while they
never fired a gun, lest the people ihouldawaken faster, than
they could overpower them. But the fire awakened them
fast enough, which obliged our fellows to keep together in
bodies. By this time the whole town was in a flame, yet
their fury rather increased, calling out to one another to
remember Tom JeiFery. The terrible light of this con-
flagration made me very uneasy, and roused my nephew
fche captain, and the rest os his men, who knew nothing of
the matter. When he perceived the dreadful smoke, and
heard the guns go off, he readily concluded his men were
in danger; he therefore takes another boat, and comes
ashore himself, with thirteen men well armed. He was
greatly surprised to see me and only two.men in the boat,
but more so when I told him the story; but though I ar-
gued, with him, as 1 did with the men, about the danger
of the* voyage, the interests of the merchants and owners,
and the safety of the (hip, yet my nephew, like the rest,
declared, that he would rather lose the ship, his voyage,
his life and all,, than his men mould be lost for want of
help j aed so away he went. For my part, seeing him re-
solved to go, 1 had not power to stay behind. He or-
dered the pinnace back again for twelve men more, and
then we marched directly as the flame guided us. But
surely never was such a scene of horror beheld, or more
dismal cries heard, except when Oliver Cromwell took
Drogheda in Ireland, where he neither spared man,* wo*
rrun, nor child.
The-first object, I think, we met with, was the ruins of
one of- their habitations, before which Jay four men and
thre,e women killed, and two more burnt to death among
the fire, which was now decaying. Nothing could appear
itore barbarous than this revenge; none more cruel thaa

the authors of it. As we went on, the fire increased, and
the cry proceeded in proportion. We had not gone much
farther, when, we beheld three naked women, followed*by
sixteen or, seventeen men. Hying with the greatest swiftness
from our men, who ihot one of them in our sight. When
they. perceived us, whom they suppoftd also their murder-
ers, they set up a most dreadful shriek, and both of them
Ikooned away in the fright. This was a light which might
have softened the hardest.heart; and in,pity we took &>m6
Ways to let them know we would not hurt them, while tht|
poor creatures with bended knees, und lifted up hands*
made piteous lamentations to us to save their lives. . I or-
dered our men cot to hurt any of the poor creatures what-
soever; but being willing to understand the occasion of all
this, I went among these unhappy wretches, who neither-
understood me, nor the good I mean£ them. However,
being resolved to put an end to this barbarity, I ordered
the men to follow me. We had not gone fifty yaids before!
we came up with the boatswain, with four of our men at
his heels, all of them covered with blcod and dust, and,in
search of more people to satiate their vengeance. As soon
as we saw them, we called out, and made them understand
who we were; upon which they came up to us, setting up
a holloo of triumph, in token that more help was come.
•-' Noble Captain/5 said he to my nephew, "I'm glad you're
come:- we have not half done with these villainous hell-
hound dogs; we'll root out the very nation of them from
the earth and kill more than poor Tom has hairs upon his
head :'*' and thus he went on till I interrupted him.—
*' Blood-thirily dog," said I, " will your cruelty never end?
I charge you touch not one creature more ; stop you* hands,
and stand still, or you're a dead man thts moment." *' Why
Sir," said he, «4 you neither know whom you are protect-
ing, nor what they have done: bu; pray coaie hither, and

which, however, I thought had *-nne too lar, agreeable to
these words of j4Cob to his fom Simeon and Levi: "Cur-
sed be their anger, for it w*s fierce; and their wrath, for
it was cruel," But this fight made my nephew and the
rest as bad lh they: nay, my nephew declared,, his con-
cern was only for his men | as for the people, not a foul

of them Ougjit to IrVe. Upon this, the boat(Wain and
eight more directly tinned about, and went to finisti the in-
tended tragedy; which being «oat of my power to prevent,
I returned back from the dlfoa! fight, and the piteous
cries of those unfortunate crMt&r£s, wbo were made vic-
tims to their fary. Indeedlut was ah egregious piece of
folly in me to return to the boat with but one attendants
and I had very near paid for it, having narrowly escaped
forty armed Indians, who had bden alarmed by the con-
flagration; but bating palFed the place where they stood, I
gdt to the boat accompanied with the supercargo, and (m
went on board, fending the pinnace back again, to assist
the men'in what might happen. When I had got to the
boat, the fire was almost extinguished, and the noise abated;
but I had scarce been half an hour on board the fhip>
when I heard another volley given by our sailors, and a
great smoke, which, as I afterwards found, was our meii
falling upon those houses and persons that stood between
them and the sea; but here they spared the wives and chil-
dren, and killed only the men, to the number of about six-
teen or seventeen. By the time they got to the shore, the
pinnace and the ship's boat were ready to receive them, and...
they all got safe on board, not a man of them having re-
ceived the least hurt,' except two, one of whom strained
his foot, arid the other burnt has hand a* little; for 'they
met with no resistance, thepocr Indians being unprepared,
amazed, and ccnfouilded.
I was extremely angry with every one of them, but par-
ticularly with the captain, who imtead of cooling the rage
of ihe men; had prompted them oh to further mischief:
nor could he make me any other excuse, but that as he
"was a man, he could not master his passion's at the sight of
cne of hismess so cruelly murdered". As for the rest,
knowing they were not under my command, they took no
r.otice of any anger, but rather boasted of their rtsengc.
According to all their accounts, they killed or destroyed
about 150 men, women, and children, besides burning
the' town to alhes. They took their companion Tom Jef-
fery from the tree, covered him with some of the ruins,
^nd so left him. But however this action of our men
might seem* to them justifiable, yet 1 always openly con-
demned it with the appellation of the Massacre of Mada-
gascar. For tho' the natives had slain this JefFery, yet cer*
thinly he was the first aggressor, by Attempting to. violate.,
the chastity of a young innocent woman, who ventured,
cfbwn to them, on the faith of the public capitulation, whicJv
was so treacherously broken.
While we were under fail, the boatswain wou!d often de-
fend this bloody action, ,hy faying, that the Indians had
broke the truce the night before^ by mooting one of oaf
ihen without ^ust provocation; and what.if the poor fel-
low had taken a 4ittle liberty with the wench, he ought not
to have been murdered in so villainous "a manner: and that
they had 2^led nothing but what the divine laws Commis-
sioned to be done to such homicides. However I was in.
the fame mird as before, telling them that they were miu>
derers, and.bid them -depend upon it that God would blast
their voyage, for such an unparalleled piece of barbarity.
When we came to the Gulph of Persia, five of our men,
Avho ventured on ihore, were either killed or made flavps,
by the Arabians, the rest of them having scarce time Ja
escape to their boat. This made me upbraid them afresh
with the just-retribution cf Heaven for such actions; upon
which the boatswain very warmly a&ed me, '" Whether
those men on whom the tower of Siioam sett, were greater
sinners than the;rest of the ^Galileans? and besides* J>ir,*'
said he, *4 none of these five poor men that are lost^ Were
with us at the Massacre of Madagascar, as you call it, and
therefore your representation is very unjust, and your ap-
plication improper. Besides," added he, "you are con-
tinually using the men very ill upon this account, and,being
but a passenger yourself, we are not obliged to bear it; nor
can we tell what evil designs you may have to bring us to
judgment for it in England; and, therefore, if you do> hot
leave this discourse, as also not concern yourself4 wit n; any;
of our affairs, I wHIJeave the (hip, and'not "fail anibhg;,
such dangerous company;** t \.
All this I heard very patiently; but, it being ofteii re-
peated, I at length told him, the concern I had oh oq>rd
was none of his business; thatj was a considerable: owner 4
in the (hip, and therefore had a right to speak in common,
and that I was no way accountable to him, nor to any bo-
dy else. As no more passed for some time after, I thought
aU had. been over. At this tim£ we were in. the roa*d of
Bengal, where, going on shore with the supercargo one day,,;
in the evening, as I was preparing to go on board, oni of the
mVft came tb; fee* and told me, I need no£ trouble ;ray self
to cphie tothe boat, for ihat the cockswain and others had.
ordered him not to carr^me on 1>oard any more. ,Thi§
insolent message much surprised me; yet I gave him no
answer to it, but went directly and acquainted the super-
cargo* entreating him to.go on board, and, by acquainting
the* Captain with it, prevent the mutiny which J perceived
would happen. But before I had spoken this, the matter
was effected on board; for no sooner was he gone off in
the boat, but the boatswain, gunner, carpenter, and all the
inferior officers, came to the quarter-deck, desiring to
f^peak with the Captain; and there the boatswain made a
'lbhg harangue, exclaiming against me, as before men-
tioned, that, if I had not,gone on Æore peaceably, for my
own diversion,'they, by violence would have compelled me,
for their satisfaction: that as they had shipped with the
(Captain,"so they would faithfully serve him; but if I did
not quit the ship, or the Captain oblige me to it., they would
l6ave the ship immediately: hereupon, turning his face
aboar, by way of signal, they all cried oat, "ONE and
ALL\ ONE and ALL I"
, You may'be sure, that though my nephew was a man
of great eourage, ye^ he could not but be surprised at
their sudden and unexpected behaviour; and though he
talked stoutly to them, and afterwards expostulated with
them, that in* common justice tome, who was aconider-
atile owner in-the ship, <\\*y could not turn me as it were
out of my own house, which might bring their lives ir*
danger should they ever be taken in England; nay,
though he invited the boatswain on shore to accommodate
niauers with me.; yet all this I fay signified nothing; they
^duld hav$ nothing to do with me; and they were resolved
t& go on shore if I came on board. ." V^ell," said my
nephew, *< if you are so resolved, permit me to talk with
him, an'd then I ha>e done $'" and so became to me, giving
nie an account 6fihek resolution, how one and all deigned
to fors&ke the fhipwhenl came onboard, for which he was
mightily concerned. "I am glad to &e you, nephew,"
sajd 1, *\ and rejoice it is no worse, since they have not re-
belled against jpu; Ignly ciesir^ yoi* to send my necciTary*

My nephew left me two persons to attend me.; one o£
them was his servant, and the other clerk to the purser^
who engaged to be mine. I took lodgings in an English-
woman's house,-where several French, one-English, and two
Italian merchants resided* The handsome entertainment
I. met with here, occasioned me to ctay nine months, con-
sidering what course I should take. Some English goods.
I~had with me of great value, besides a thousand pieces of,
eight, and a letter for more, if there was sucji necessity*
The goods I so«n disposed of to advantage, and bought.
here several good diamonds, which I could easily carry
about with me. One morningthe Engliih merchant came
to me, as being very intimate together, ** Countryman,'*
said he, ** I have a project to eommtmicate to you, which
r'hope will suit to both our advantage. To be short, Sir,
we are both in a remote part of the world from ourcoun^,

Aionths time* J returned to Bengal, very well satisfied with
this adventure, having not 6nly got a sufficient quantity of
imdiXey;but-an insight of getting a great deal more,

Hfincng the Spice 1 stands* and bring home a load of cloven
from the Manillas, or thereabout*; islands belonging part-
$y-to Spam, font where the Ehitch trade very considerably,;
We were not long in preparing for this voyage, which we
•made no less successful than the last, touching at Borneo,
and several other places which I do not perfectly re mem-
beri and returning home in about five months time. We
soon fold our spices, which were chiefly cloves and some
nutmegs, to the Persian ifferchants, who carried them away
for the gulph; and, in ihort, making five to one advantage,
we were loaded with money.
Not long after myfriend and I had made up our ac->
counts, to our entire satisfaction, there came in a Dutch*
coaster from Batavia, of about two hundred tons. The
crew of this vessel pretended themselves so sickly, that
there ^were not hands sufficient to undertake a voyage ; and
the Captain having given out that he intended to go tor
Europe, public notice was given that the stiip was to be
fold. No sooner did this come to our ears, but we bought
the strip, paid the master, and took pofleffion. We would
alfoliave very willingly entertained some of the'merri but-
they having received their share of booty, were not to be
found, being altogether fled to Agra, the great city of the
I&ogul's residence; and from thence went to travel to Su-
rat, and so by the sea to the Persian Gulph. And indeed
th%y had reason to fly in this manner; for the truth of it
was the pretended Captain was the gunner only, and not
the ^Om strand er v that having been on a trading voyage,
tfiey were attacked on ihore by the Malayans* who killed >
three men and the Captain; after whose death the other'
eleven men run away with the ship to the Bay of Bengals
and left the mate and five men more on more; but of this
affair we (hall have occasion to speak more, at length here*
after.
fioWever they came by the (hip, we thought we bought

ters when the man showed os a bill of sale for the ship (un-

voyage, contrary winds beat ps up aad down for a, confir

No sooner were we clear of those rugged seas, but we petv
ceived our ship had sprang a k"ik, which obliged us to put
into th? ri^er Cambodia, which lies northward of the
GuJph, and goes up to Siam.
Oiie day, as I was on ihore refreshing myself, there
•cc-rnes to me an Englishman, who was gunner's mate .oa
board .æn English East India, ship, riding up the river near
the city of Cambodia: *« Sir/' said he,." you may. wonder

none, except my ship being leaky, for which I design to
have her run aground to-morrow morning." "I hope you
will be better en-ployed when you shall hear what I have
to say to you. Ycu know the town of Cambodia is about
f.fteen leagues op this river; about three leagues on this
£de of it, there lie two Datch and three English ships..
And would you venture here without considering what
Hrength you have to engage them r" I knew not what he
.meant by this discourse, and turning short upon him,

said the man, " if you do think yourselves secure,, all as I
. can fay, you must take your chance; however, I am very
sorry you are so deaf to good advice;, but I assure you*, if
you do-not put to sea immediately, you will be attacked
"by five long-boats full of men, hanged yourself for a pirate,

wards." "I thought, Sir," added fae, xi I might have
met a better reception far such a singular piece of serviced*

at Samatm, when your Captain was murdered \Sy the MaK

feme who were on board you, ran away with the ship, and
ar£ since turned pirates at sea* Now, Sir, this is the sum
of what I had to say; and I can positively asstfre you, that
if yem are taken, you will be executed without much ce-
remony, for undoubtedly y#u cannot:but be sensible what
link law? merchant ships show to pirates, whenever they*
fall into their hands."
*' Sir," said I, "I thank you for your kind iaformi-
tion; and though I am sure no man could come more
honestly by the ship than I have done, yet knowing their
enterprize, and being satisfied of your hone^ intention, I'll
be upon my defence." "tVythee, Sir," said the man,
** don?t talk of being upon your defence, the best that you
can make is to be out of danger; and therefore, if you
have any regard for ycur life, and the lives of your men,
take the advantage,-without fail, of puttirig out to sea at
high-water; by which means, as you have a whole tide
before you, you will b,e gose top far out of their teach be-
fore they can come down."
.- "I am mighty well satisfied," said I, " in this particu-
lar, and for yocr kindness, which merits my great esteem,
?j3rav, Sir, what amends shall I iHake you?" He replied, <
** 1 know not what amends you are willing to make, be-
cause yoss may have some doubts of its certainty: but, to
convince you of the truth of what I fay> I have one e$er
to make to you. On board one of the English (hips, I
have nineteen months pay due to me, and this Dutchman
that is with me has seven months pay due to him j which if
you will make good to us, we will go along with you.- If
you fhalMind that there is nothing in what we hive said,
then we fnall desire nothing; but when you are convinced
that we have saved the (kip, your life, arid the lives of the
--men, we will leave the whole to your generosity."
• So reasonable did this every way appear, that I imme-
diately consented, and we went directly on board. As
-icjoh as we camexjn board, my partner calls joyfully out,
"That they had -stopped the leak?" " Well, thank God,"
*ikid I, ""but pray- let us weigh anchor forthwith."—
*?: Weigh," said He, ^ what is the meaning of this hurry l,r
^tPray aik fvc* questions," said I, *< but all hands tq.wQrk,

without losing^ moment's time." UponjvJiiQ^ritVign^
surprise, the Captain was called, who immediately ordered,
the anchor to te got up; and though the tide was not cjuue
down, yet, being assisted with a little land breeze, we stooA
to sea. I then' called my partner into the cabin, and re-
lated the story at large, which was confirmed and more am-
plihe'd by the two men I had brought on board. Scarce ha<|
we Enifhed cur discourse upon this, head, bat a saiJor carn^
to the cabin door, with a message from the Captain, that
we were chased by five floops full of armed men. «< Very,
well," said J, if it is plain now there is something in it.'*
And so, going upon.deck, I told all the men there was a
design for seizing the strip, and.of executing us fcr,pirates;
and aslted them'whether'they would faithfully stand by.us,
and by cne another'?" To which they unanimously replied^.
** That they would fight to their last drop qs blood." I
Ken asked the Captain, which way he thought best for as
to manage the battle r «« Sir," said he, « the only method
n to keep them off with cur great snot as long as we are
able, and then have recourse to our small arms; and when
both these fail us, then retire to close quarters, when per-
haps the enemy, wanting materials, can neither break open
our bulk head?, nor get in upon us." Mean time the gun-
ner was ordered to bring two guns to bear fore and aft out
of the storage,, and-so' load them with mu&et-bullett and
small pieces'of oki iron; and the deck being cleared, we
pi-cpaied for the engagement, still, however, keeping out
at sea. The boats followed us, with all the fail they could
make, and we could perceive the two foremost were Eng-
lift, which outsailed the rest by two leagues, and which we
found would com; up with us: hereupon, we fired agua
without a ball, intimating that they should bring to* and w©
put out a Has of truce> as a %nal sor 2**^; but sistdll>£
them crowding after us, till they came within (hot, we took;
ia our white, and hanging out the red stag, immediately
stred at. them with ball: we then called to them with a
speaking trumpet, bidding them at their peril keep off.
But all this signified nothing; for depending upon the-
strength that followed them, they were resolutely bent far,
mischief: hereupon I ordered them to Bring the ship to*
by which means, they lying upon our .broadside, we let sty
at them at once, one of whom carried away the stereos the*
fcandermoft boat, and obliged them not only to take 4owa
t^tPs^s btitmscitihttn all run to the he&& of the boas,
to keep them from sinking, and so she lay by, having
encitgh of it. In the mean time, we prepared to welcome
the foremost boat in the fame manner* While we were do-,
ing this, one of the three hindermost boats came up to the,
relief of that which was disabled, and took the men out of
her. We agairf called to parky with them; but, instead of
an answer, one of the boats came close troder our stern;
whereupon our gunner let By his two chafe guns, but mif-
fing, the men in the boat shouted, and, waving their caps,
came on with greater fury. To repair this seeming dis-
grace, the gunner soon got ready, and firing a second
time, did a great deal of mischief among the enemy. We
Waved again, and, bringing our quarter to bear upon them,
fired three guns more, when we found the boat a finking,
and several men already in the sea; hereupon, manning
our pinrace,! gave orders to save as many as they could,
and instantly to come on board, because the rest of their
boats were approaching: accordingly they did so, and took
up three of them> one of whom was almost past recovery;
and then crowding all the fail we could, after our men came
on board, we stood out farther to sea, so that the other
three boats gave over the chafe, when they came up to the
first two. Thus delivered from imminent danger, we
Changed our course to the eastward, quite out of the course,-
of all European mips.
Being now a: sea, and inquiring more particularly of the •
two seamen, the meaning of a-1 thk, the Dutchman at once
let us into the secret. He told us, that the fellow who fold
as the (hip was an errant thief, who had?run away with her ;.
that the Captain was treacherously murdered on the coast
of Molucca by the natives there, with three of his men;
that lie, the Dutchman, and four more, being-obliged to*
have recourse to the woods for their safety, at length escaped I
by means of a Dutch ship, in its way to China, which had
sent their boat on shore for fresh water: That, after this/
he went to Batavia, where two of the seamen, belonging to-
the ship (who had deserted the rest in their travels) ar-
rived, and there gave an account that the fellow who ran
away with the ship had fold her at Bengal to a set of pi-
rates, who went a cruising, and had already taken one-
English and two Dutch ships, richly laden.
k Now, tho* this was absolutely false, my partner truly--
said, that our deliverance was to be esteemed so much the
K5
-IHoreyby reason, had we fallen into their hands, we could
hjive expe£ked nothing from them but immediate death*
considering our accusers would have been our judges; and,
. therefore, his opinion was to return directly to Bengal,
where, being known, we could prove how honestly we came
*ky the (hip, of whom we bought her, and the like, and
where we were sure of ibme justice; at leaii would not be
-h^nged.rlrrt, and judged afterwards. J was at sirst of ray
_ partner's opinion, but when I had more seriously .consider-
ed os the matter, I told him, we ran a great hazard in at-
-tejiiptis!g to return, being on the wrong side of the Strai:s
.of Molucca, and that, if, upon alarm given, we should be
-laken by the Dutch at Batavia, or Engl.ih elsewhere, .our
r. running away would be a sufneient evidence to condemrvus.
. ffhis danger indeed startled not only my partner, but lil^e-
nwife^allthe (hip's compeny; so we changed our former re-
»£cjutioi5, and resolved to go the coast os Tonquin, and -so
*0 that of China, where, pursuing our first design as to
trade, we might likewise have an opportunity to dispose of
the ship some way or other, and to return to Bengal in. any
country teiselwe could procure. This being agreed 40,
we stee'red away N. N. E. about 50 leagues off the usiial
course to the east, which put us to some inconveniences. As
the wind blew steadily against us, cur voyage became moire
tedious, and we began to be afraid of want of provision;
and what was still worse, we apprehended, that as those
ihips, from whose boats we had escaped, were bound to
China, they might get before us, and have given fresh in-
formation, which might create another vigorous pursuit.
Indeed, I could not h.-lp being grieved, when I considered
that I who bad never wronged or defrauded any person- in
jmy life, was now pursued like a common thief, and if ta*
ken to run the greatest danger of being executed as fLdu$
and, though innocent, 1 found myself under the necessity of
flying for my safety; and thereby escape being brought,to
shame, of which I was even more afraid than of death itself,
It was easy to read my dejection in my countenance. M*/
mind was oppressed, like those unhappy innocent persons*
who being overpowered by blasphemous and perjured evi*
denxes, wickedly resolved to takeaway their,lives,or ruia
their reputation, have no other recourse in ;this world to
cafe their sorrow, but sigh$, prayers, and tears. My partner
feeing &e so coriceined, enecuraged me as well as he could;
smd, after describing, to me the several oortsi>f that coast,
lie told me," he would either pat me in on the coast of Co-
<te>chiiia, or else in the bay of Tonquin, from whence we
might go to Macao,' a town once possessed by the Portu-
guese, and where still many European families resided.
To this place we fleered, and, early next morning,. can*e *
in fight of the coVIt; but thought it advisable to put into
a small river where we could, either over land* or by the
ship's pinnace, know what vessels were in* any ports there-
abouts. This happy step prr ved oar deliverance; for, next
morning, there came to the bay^of Tonquin two Dutch
ships, and a third, without any colours; and in-ihe even-
ing, two English ships steered the fame courses The river
where we were was but smalls and run buta few leagues up
the country northward ^ the country was wild and barba-
rous, and the people thieves, having no correspondence with
any othtt nation; dealing only in fish,' oil, and such gross
commodities: and one barbarous custom they stili retained,
that when any vessel was unhappiiv shipwrecked upon their
coast, they make the men prisoners or staves; so that now
we might fairly say we were surrounded by^enemies both
by sea and land, .
As the ship had been leaky, we tobk the opportunity, in
this place, to search, her, and to stop op the places which
let in the water. We accordingly lightened her, and bring-
ing our guns and other moveable things to one fide, we es-
sayed to bring her down, that we might come to her^ bot-
tom: but,? upqn s eond consideration, we did not think if
safe to let her lie on dry grounds neither indeed was the
place convenient for it. The inhabitants^ not used to such
a fight as to fee a ship He down on one fide, and heel in t®^
wards the ihOre,*and not perceiving her men5 who were at
work on her bottom, with stages and bdats on the tss-side1,
presently imagined the ship had-been cast away^ and lay
fast en the grounds Agreeable to this supposition, they
sunt unded us with ten or twelve large boats, with a refo*
imton, undoubtedly, to plunder the (hip, and to carry away
those they found alive for staves to their king* But when
they perceived our men hard at work on the (hip's bottom
and fide, wa(hingv.grav.ingj and stopping her, it til/ed then*
all with such surpi iie, that they stood gazing as though they
W>ere cor.found-ed. Nor could we imagine what their de-
sign was; however, ior fear of danger, we handed down
urns and ammunition to those at work, in order to defend
• £6
themselves; $nd, indeed, this-'.precaution #as abfolotefy
^necessary; for, in a quarter of an hour after, the native*,
concluding it was really a shipwreck, and that we were so-
wing our liver and goods, which they thought belonged io
them, came down upon our men, as though it had been ki
line of battle. We lay a* present but in a very unfit pollute
:*to fight; and before the stfges could be got down, or the
men in the boat come on board as they were ordered, the
Cochinchinefe were upon them, and two of their boats
boarding our long-boat, they began to lay hold of our men
as prisoners. The first they seized was a stout English
sailor, who never fired his musket, like a fool as I imagined,
but laid it down in the boat: but he knew what he was do-
ing ; for, by main force, he dragged the Pagan out of the
boat into ours by the two ears, and knocked his brains out
against the boat's gunnel; a Dutchman that was next him.
snatched up the musket, and knocked down five more with
the butt-end of it; however, this was doing very little tk>
their number; but a strange unexpected accident, which ra-
ther merits laughter than any thing else,, gave our men a
^complete victory over them.
It seems the carpenter* who was preparing to grave the
-Outside of the ship, as well as to pay the seams, where he
caulked to stop the leaks,, had gotten two kettles just let
'4c wn-. in the boat, one filled with boiling pitch, and tns
gHher with rosin, tallow, oil, and feeh stuff as the ship-
wrights use; the carpenters man had a great iron ladle
with which he used to supply the workmen with hot stuff,
and as two of the enemies entered the boat where the fel-
low stood, he saluted them with a full ladle of the hot boil-
ing liquor, which, the poor creatures being half naked,
made them roar out, and jump into the sea. " Well done,
Jack,** fays the carpenter, " give them the other doseiP
and so stepping forward himself, takes a mop, and dipping
it into the pitch pot, he and his man so plentifully flung It
among them, as that none escaped being scalded; upon
which they all made the best of their way, crying and
howling in such a frightful manner, that, in all my: adven-
tures, I never heard the like, And, indeed* never was J
better pleased with any conquest t&an I was with this, there
being so little bloodshed, and having at* aversion to .killing
such savage wretches, (niore than wa£ ne£efiary) as know-
ing they, came^on erxaads, which their laws* and custom*
liiade them think were jail and equitable. 'By this time/all
things being in ^rder* and the ihip swimming, the)r found
theirmistake, so they did net venture a second attack.
Thus ended our merry fight; and, having got rice, bread,
Toots, and sixteen good hogs on board the day before we
&t fail, not daring to go into the bayof Tonquin, but fleer-
ed N. E. toward the iste Of Formdsa, or as tho* -we would
-•go to the Manillas, or Philippine islands, for fear of meet-
ing with any European (hips; when we anchored at the iste
Tof Formosa, the inhabitants not only courteously supplied
us with provisions and fresh water, but dealt very fairly and
honeftly with us in their bargains and agreements. From
this place we steered north, keeping still off the coast rif
China, till we were beyond all its p>rts where European
(hips usually come; and, at length, being come to the lati-
tude of thirty degrees, we resolved to put into the firsttra-
xiing port we should come at; and standing for the shore, a
boat came off two leagues to us, with an old Portuguese
pilot on board, who offered his service; we very gladly ac-
cepted him, and sent the boat back again. And now, ha-
ving the old man on board, I talked to him of going to
Nanquin, the most northward part of the coast of China,
*« What will you do there?" said he, smiling. I toM
him we would sell our cargo, and purchase calicoes, raw
and wrought silks, tea, &c. and so return the same %ay
back- *• O;** said he, «• you had better put in at Macao,
where you may buy China wares as cheap as at Nanquin,
and fell you opium at a greater advance." " But/' said J,
** we are gentlemen, as well as merchants, and design to fee
the great city of Pekin, and the magnificent court of the
monarch of China." " Why, then," said he, " you should
g* to Nihgpo, where there is a navigable river that goes
through the heart of that vast empire* two hundred and
seventy leagues from the sea, which crosses all the rivers,
passes considerable hills, by the help of the flukes and
gates, and gats even up to the city of Pekin. You may
go to Nanquin, if you please, and travel to Pekin, and
there is a Dutch (hip just: before bound that way." At the
name of a Dutch or English ship, I was struck, with con-
fusion; they beings as great a terror to me in this vessel, Ss
an Algerine man of war is to them in the Mediterranean.
The old man finding me troubled, ** Sir," said he, '* I
hope the Dutch are n«vt now at war with your nation.**
** No/* said J, " bat God knows what liberty they may

he, ft what occasion is there for peaceabfcr merchant so
fear? For, believe me, they never mtddie with -any 'b&t
PIRATES." i
At the mentioning the word pirates, my countenance
tamed to that of scarlet ;.nor was it possible for me to con-
ceal it from the old pilot; who taking notice of it, '*- Sir,**
said he, •« take what course you please, \*l\ do you all the
service I can" "Seignior," said I, ** I am a Iktle con-
cerned at your mentioning pira es; 1 hope there are none
such in t^efe seas, because you see in what weak*condition
we are to defend ourselves." "O, Sir,** said he, *' if that's
all, don't be concerned, I don't remember one in these
seas these fifteen years, except about a month ago one was
seen in the bay of Siam, but he is gone tvj the southward";
neither was she built for a privateer* but was rua away with
by a reprobate Captain, and some os his men, the right
Captain having been murdered by the Malayans.5*
"What!" said I, (as though 'gnorantor what had hap-
pened) "did they kill the Captain?" " No," said he,
*« it is generally thought the Malayans murdered him ; but
perhaps they might procure them to doit, and therefore
they juilly deserve hanging. The rogues were late ly dis*
covered in the bay of Siam, in thd river of Cambodia, by
some-Dotchmen who belonged to the (hip, and had much
ado to escape.the five boats that pursued them, but they
have solemnly sworn to give no quarter to the Captain or
the seamen, but hang them,every one up at the yard-arm,
without any formal business;of bringing them to a court of
judicature."
Being feasible, that* having the old man on board, he
was incapabre of doing me any mischief, "Well, Setg*
nior," said I, «' 't is for this very reason I would have yotf
carry us tip to Nanquin, where neither English nor Dutch; ^
ships come; and I must tell you, their Captains are a par-
cel of rash, proud, insolent rascals, that neither know
what belongs tojuflice, nor how to behave themselves a*
the laws of God or nature direct; fellows that would prove
murderers,to punish robbers, and take upon them to ad-
judge innocent men to death* without any proof to prove
them guilty; but perhaps I may live to call them to ac-
count for it, in a place where they m?y be taught now^
justice is to be executed." And so I told him all the story-
os bujing the fhipi and how we were saved by the meao* of
ityfo'Tuqtsti that the murder of the Captain by the Mat-
ins, as also the running away with the (hip, 1 believed to be
true,;, but that we, who bought it, were turned pirates, was
a mere fiction, to cover their cowardice and foolish beha-
viour, when they attacked us, and the blood of those men
we killed in our own just defence, lay at their door, who
fj?nt to attack us by surprise.
"Sir," said the old man amazed, "you ha^e taken the
right course to steer to the north, and, if I might advise
you, I would have you sell your ship in China, and buy or
buiid another in that country; and I'll procure people to
buy the one and sell the other." "Well, but, Seignior,"
said I> " if I sell the ship in this manner, 1 may bring
some innocent persons into the fame dangers I have gone
through, perhaps worse, even death itself; whereby 1
should be as guilty of their murder as their villainous exe-
cutioners." "That need not trouble you," fays the old
man, *' I'll find a way to prevent that; for these com-
manders you talk of I knew very well, and wll inform
them rightly of the matter as you have related, and 1 ara
persuaded they will not only believe me, but act more cau-
tiously for the future." "And will you deliver one mei-
sage from me to thtm r" "Yes," said he, " is you will
give it under your hand, that 1 may prove it is not of my
own production." Hereupon I wrote a large account of
their attacking me in their long-boat, the pretended rea-
son and unjust design of it; that they had done what they
might be ashamed of, and could not answer for at any tri->
banal in England, But,this letier was writ in vain* Pro-
vidence ordered things another way. We sailed directly^
for Nasquiii, and in about thirteen days fail, came to. an
anchor at the south-west point of the great gulph of that
place, where we learned, that two Dutch ships were gone
the e'Ggth before us, and that we should certainly ialiimo
their hands. We were ail,at a great loss in this exigency,
and would very gladly have been on shore almost any
where; but our. old pilot told me, that if 1 would sail to
the southward about two and forty leagues, there was ,æ
little port called Quinehange, where no European stups
ever came, and where me might consider what was fury;
ther to be ddne* Accordingly we weighed anchor the
next day* calling-only twice on more by the way to gfi^
fresh water. The country people very courteously sold us.

days sail we came to the port, and landed w!ft unfpeaTcaBje

other way possible, than enter on board that ill-fated vessel
more; for no state can be more miserable than a continued.
fear, which is a life of death, a confounder of our underr
standings, that sets the imagination at work to form a thou-
sand frightful things that may never happen. And we,
scarce slept one night, without dreaming of halters, yard-
arms, or gibbets, of fighting, being taken, and being kill-
ed ; nay, so violent were our apprehensions, that we wouTicL
braise our hands and heads against the fides of the cabin,
as though actually engaged. The story of the Dutch
cruelty at Amboyna, often came into our thoughts when
awake; and, for my parr, I thought my cond tion very,
hard, that after so many difficulties and such signal de-
liverances, 1 should be hanged in my old age, though in-
nocent of any crime that deserved such punishment; but
then religion would seem to represent to me, as though the
voice of it had said, consider, O man! what sins you have
"been formerly guilty of; which now thou art called to an
account for, to expiate with thy blood 1 And as to thy in~
nocence, what art thou more innocent than thy blessed Re-
deemer Jesus Christ, who suffered for thy offences, and to
whose providence you ought to submit, let what will hap-
pen? After this, natural courage would inspire me to re-
fist to the last drop of blood, and sooner die than suffer my-
self to be taken by bocrifb, rascally Dutchmen, who had
arts to torment beyond death itself.
But now, thank kind Heaven, being ashore, oar old pi-
lot procured us a lodging and a warehouse for our goods;
it was a little hut with a large warehouse joining to it, ast
built with canes, and pallisadoed round wita large ones, td
keep out pilfering thieves, which are very numerous in that
country. The magistrates allowed us a little guard during,
the night* and we employed a centinel with a kind of hal-
bert for three pence a day. Tht fair, or mart, we found,
had been over for some time; however, there remained in
the river four junks and two Japan {hips, the merchants of
the latter being on shore. In the first place, dur old pilot
brought us acquainted with the missionary Roman priests,,
who were converting the people to Christianity r'two of
them were reserved, rigid, and austere, applying themselves
to the work: they came about with great earnestness; but
the third, who was a Frenchman, called Father Simon, waa
ff A freer cpnvjErsation, riot seemingly so serious and grave,
yet no worse Christian than the other two, one of whom
was a Portuguese, and the other a Genoese. Father Simon,
it seems, was appointed to go to Peken, the royal feat of
the Emperor of the Chinese; and he only waited for ano-
ther priest, who nas ordered from Macao to accompany
him. We never met together, tat he was prompting me
to accompany him in that journey: «' Sir," said he, " I
will show you the glorious things of this mighty empire,
and a city, the city of Pekin, far exceeding Lordon and
Paris, put them both together. One day in particular, be-
ing at dinner with him, J showed some inclination to go;
which made him press the more upon me and my partner,
to gain our perfect consent. "But, Father Simon," said
rny partner, " what satisfaction can you have in our com-
pany whom you esteem as heretics, and consequently objects
not worthy your regard?" " O," said he, "you may be
as good Catholics in time as those I hepe to convert to our
religion/* " And so," said I, uwe shall have you preach-
ing to us all the way, instead of pleasing us with a descrip-
tion of the country." " Sir," said he," however our reli-
gion may be villified by some people, it is very certain it
neither divests us of good manners or Christian charity j
and as we are gentlemen, as such we may converse toge-
ther, WJShtfttt iriakina one anntK#r nn**fvjr
But we shall leave him awhile, to consider our ship and
the merchandise which we had to dispose of. There was
but very little trade in the place where we were; and I
was once resolved to venture to sail to the river Kilaro, and
so to the city of Nanquin; but Providence ordered it other-
wise, by our old pilot's bringing a Japan merchant to us,
lo fee what goods we had. He immediately bought our
opium, for winch he gave us a very good price in gold by
weight, some wedges of which were about ten or eleven
ounces. It came into my head that perhaps he might buy
the ship too,; and I ordered his interpreter to propose it to
him. He said nothing then, but stuugged up his moulders;
yet in a few days after he carae accompanied by a mission-
ary priest, who was his interpreter, with this proposal,
*•' That as he had bought a great quantity of our goods,
he bad not money enough to purchase our ship; but if I
$k&fed he would hire her, with all my men, to go to Japan*
aud from tkeace with another loading 10 the Philippine
islands, the freight of both which he would Te^w^fWgTy
pay to us before; aitd at theirretuin: to japan, would Diiy
the ship." Upon this we asked" fiie Captain and his men,
if they were willing to go to J#pan ;'. to which they unam-
m au sly agreed. While this was in agitation, the young
man rny nephew left to attend me, told me, 6* That as i
did not care to accept this prospect of advantage, he wBuld
manage it for me as I pleased, and render me a faithful ac-
count of his success, which would be wholly rnine,?> In-
deed I was very unwibing to part with him ; but confider-
ing it might be for the young mar/s good, I discoursed with
my partner about it, who, of his own generosity, gave Him
h:s share of the vessel, so that I could do no otherwise than.
give him mine: but,, however, we let him have but the
proper half of it, and preserved a power, that when we
rr.et in England, if he had obtained success, he Should ac-
count to us for one half of the profits of ihe ship's freight,
and the other should be his own. Thus having taken a
writing under his hand, away he sailed to Japan, where the
merchant dealt very honestly by him, got him a licence to
come cm shore, sent him loaded to the Philippines with a
Japanese supercargo, from whence he came back again
loaded with European goods, cloves, and other spiceries.
By this voyage he cleared a considerable sum of money,
which determined him not to sell his (hip, but to trade tm
his own account;. so he returned to the Manillas> wherey.
getting acquaintance, he made his ship free, was hired by
the governor privately to go to Acapulco in America, oa
the Mexican coast, with a licence to travel to the great city
of Mexico. This trasiic turned cut greatly to account,
and my friend finding- means to get to Jamaica, returned
nine years after exceedingly rich into England. -.
In parsing with the mip, it comes in course to corrfider
ct those men who had saved our lives when in the river of
Cambodia;. and ihough, by the way, they were a couple
of rogues, who thought to turn pirates themselves, yet we
paid them what they had before derhandedyalFKi gave each
of: them a small sum of money, making' the Englishman a
gunner j and the Dutchman a: boatswains with which they
were very iveli contented.
VV^ were tiow about 1600 leagues farmer Itom hbitte^
than when at Bengal. All the cc rrfTbrt we * cb6l& expect
Was, that their being ancrher fair to be kept-i^^miftth^i
time, we might notx>nly purchase ail sorts of that country's
jmawjfectures, hut very possibly find some Chinese junks,
or v«$eb from Tonquip, to be fold, which would carry us
and our goods wheresoever we pleased* Upon these hopes*
we resolved to continue; and, to divert ourselves, we took
ieverallittle journies in the countiy. About ten days after
wj* parted with our- snip, we travelled to see the city of
J^Ianquin. The city lies in latitude 30 degrees north of
the line: ft is regularly built,., and the streets are exactly
straight, and cross one another in diiect lines, which sets it
out to the greatest advantage. At cur return, we found
the priest, was come from Macao, that was to accompany
father Si most to Pekin. That father earnestly solicited me
to accompany him, and 1 referred him to my partner. lo
short, we both agreed, and prepared accordingly; and we
were sq lucky as to have liberty, to travel among the reti-
iu;e oj one of their Mandarines, who is a principal magi-
$t%tt, and much reverenced by the people.
We were five and twenty days travelling thro* this mi-
serable country, infinitely populous,but as indifferently cul-
tivated; and yet their pride is infinitely greater than their
poverty, insomuch that tha priests themielves derided the.ru
As we passed by the house of one os their country gentle-
men, two leagues off Nanquin, we had the honour, forsooth*
to ride with the Chinese squire about pvro miles. Never
was Don Quixote so exactly imitated I Never such a com«-
pound of pomp and poverty seen before!
His habit, made of calico, was dirty, greasy, and very
proper for a Merry Andrew or Scaramouch, with all its
tawdry trappings, as hanging sleeves, tassels, &c. though
torn and rent in almost every part; his vest underneath it
was no less -dirty, but more greasy, resembling the most ex-
quisite sloven or greasy butcher: his horse (worsethan Rosi-
cante, or the famous steed ofdoughty Hudibras) was a poor
starved decrepid thing,that would not fell for thirty (hillings
in England; and yet this piece of worshipful pomp was at-
tended with ten or twelve staves who guarded their master
to his country-seat. We stopped at a little village for re~
(re&ment; and when we came by the country-seat of this:
great man, ws found him sitting under a tree before his
dcor, eating a mess of boiled rice, with a great piece of*
garlic iiv the middle, and a bag filled with green pepper by
him, and another plant like ginger, together with a piece,
ff lean muuoji in it : thi* was his worihip's repast,; but
pray observe the state of the food ! two women slaves bfooghs
him his food, which being laid before him, two others ap-
peared to perform their respective offices; one fed hkifc
-with a spoon, while the other scraped off what fell upon his.
beard and taffety vest, and gave »t to a particular favourkc
to eat. And thus tve left the wretch pleased with the cotw
©eit of our admiring his magnificence, which rather me-?
riled our scorn and detestation.
At length we arrived at the great city of Pekin, accom-
panied by two servants, and the old Portuguese pilot, whose
charges we bore, and whro served us as an interpreter by
the way. We had scarce been a week at Pekin, but he
comes laughing to us, " Ah! Seignior Inglise,5' said he,
•• me something tell you make your heart glad, but make
Trie sorry : for youbring me here twerity-five days journey,-;
anrf now you leave me go back alone; and which ^vay <
shall I make my port after, without de ship, without de
fcorse, without pecune?" so he called money in his broken
.Latin, He then informed me, that there was a great ca-
ravan of Muscovite and Polish merchants in the city, who-
were preparing to set out for Muscovy by land within sifc
**weeks; and, that he was certain we would take this oppor-
tunity-, and consequently that he must go home by himself,
indeed this news infinitely surprised and pleased me.
** ArQ you certain of this f" said I, "Yes, Sir," fays
he, " me sure its true/5 And so he told me, that having
met an old acquaintance of his, an Armenian, in the street,
who was among them, and who had come from Astracan,
with a design to go to Totiquin, but for certain reasons
having altered his resolutions, he was now resolved; to go
wkh the caraVan, and to return by the river Wolga to A*
stracan. "Well> Seignior," said I, "don't be discon^
tenled about your returning alone; and if, by this means,,
I cart tint a passage to England, it will be your own fault
if you return to Macao at all,5* And so consulting with-
mypartner what was best to be done, he referred it to me
as I pleased, having our affairs so well settled at Bengal,
that, if he could convert the good voyage he had made in
China silks, wrought or raw, he would be satisfied to go to
Engte'nd, and ib return to Bengal in the Company's, (flips..
Thti* resolved, we agreed that if our pilot would go with
os, we would bear his charges either to Moscow, orJSr^r
land*; and ib give him in a present the sum of one hun-
dred and seventy poands sterling. Hereupon we called
him in, and told him the cause of his complaint should 4>es
rerhoved, if he would accompany, us with the caravans^
arvd, therefore, we desired to know his mind. At this he
sliook his head, ** Great long journey/' said he, " me no
jtecune carry me to Moscow, or keep me there." But
we soon put him out of that concern, by making him sen*
sible of what we would give him here to lay out to the best
advantage; and, as for his charges, we would set him safe
on shore, God. willing, either in Moscovy, or England, as
he pleased, at our own charge* except the carriage of hi*
goods. At this proposal, he was like a man transported,
telling us, he would go with us all the world over; and we
made preparations for our journey; but it was near four
months before all the merchants were ready.
In the mean time, my partner and the pilot went express
t$ the port where we first put in, to dispose of what goods
had been left there, while 1 accompanied a Chinese mer-
chant who was going to.Nanquin, and there bought twenty-
nine pieces of damask* with about three hundred more ofe
other fine silks; and, by the time my, partner returned tQ
Pekin, I had them all carried thither j our cargo in silks
amounted to 4500I. sterling, which, together with tea, sine
calicoes, nutmegs, and cloves, loaded eighteen camels for.
our stiare* besides what we rode upon, with two or three
/pare horses, and two more loaden with provisions; the
company now was very great, making about four hundred
horse, and above one hundred and twenty men, well armed-
and provided. We were of several nations, among whoa
were fivebeotch merchants, inhabiting in Moscow,,ami-
well experienced in* trade.
We set out from Pekin the beginning of February oor
style; and in two days more, we-passed through the gate?
of the-great China wall, which was erected as a fortisiea*
tion against the Tartars, being one hundred Engjiih aules;
Jong. We then entered a country not near so populous*
chiefly under the power of plundering Tartars, several com*
panies pf whom we perceived riding on poor starved horsey ,
contemptible as themselves, without order or discipline.
One time our leader, for the day gave us leave to go &
hunting; but what do you think we hunted? only a par-"
eel of sheep, which indeed exceeded any in the world for;
wUdnefa and swiftness; but, while we were pursuing this-
ganse,* it>was mt chance*to meet with about, forty Tafiari* -.
who no foof er perceived us, but one of them Blew &hcrn,
at the found of which there soon appeared a troop of tony
o'r fifty more, at about a mile's distance. Hereupon, one
of the Scots merchants (who knew their ways) ordered us
to advance towards them, and attack them immediately.
As we advanced, they let fly a volley of arrows, which
happily fell a little short of us; this made us halt a little,
to return the compliment with bullets ;^and then being fed
up by the bold Scot, we fired our pistols in their faces, and
drew out our swords; but there was no occasion; for they
flew like timorous sheep, and only three of them remained,
beckoning to the rest to come back. But our brave com-
mander gallops up to them by himself, shot one dead,
knocked another off his horse, while the third ran away.;
and thus ended our battle with the Tartars.
We travelled a menth more through the Emperor of
China's dominions; and at length coming to one of their
towns about a day and a half's journey from the city of
Naum, 1 wanted to buy a camel. The person 1 spoke to
would have brought me one, but, like a fool, I must go
along with him, about two miles from the village. My
old pilot and 1 walked on foot, forsooth, for some variety,
when coming tb the place where the camels were kept as in
a park guarded by Chinese soldiers, we there agreed and
bought one, which the Chinese man that came along with
me Ted along the road. But we had not gone far, before
we were attacked by five Tartars, mounted on horseback,
two of-whom seized the man, took the camel from him,
and rode away, vvhile the other three approached us, the
first of whom suddenly seized me as I was drawing my
fvfcord, the second knocked me down, but my old trusty^
Portuguese, taking a pistol out of his pocket, which'I
knew nothing of, and coming up to the fellow that struck ,
me, be with one hand pulled him cIF his horse, and then
shot him dead upon the spot; then taking his scymitar, he
struck at the man that stopped us, butTstifling him, cut eft"
one of his horfe*3 ears, the pain of which made him throw
his rider to the ground. The poor Chinese who had led the
camel, seeing the Tartar down, runs to him, and seizing
upon his pole*ax, wrenched it from his hands, and knocked
hisbrains out. But there was another Tartar to deal with,!
ivho seeming neither inclined to tight nor fly, and my bid'
men having begun to charge his pistol, the very fight bf ijt
stiuck such a terror into the wretch, that aw4y he scourec!,
leaving my* old pilot, rather my champion and defender,
an.absolute victory.
By this time being awakened from my trance, I began
to open my eyes, wondering where I was, having quite
forgot all that passed.; but my fenses returning.,and feeling
a great pain in my head, and seeing the blood was running
over my clothes, I instantly jumped upon my feet, and
grasped my sword \u my hand, with a resolution to take re-
venge: but no enemies now remained, except the dead
Tartar, with his horse standing by him. The old man
seeing me recovered, whom he thought slain, ran towards
me, and embraced me with the greatest tenderness, at the
fame time examining into my wound, which was far from
being mortal. When we returned to the village, the man
demanded payment, for his camel, which [refusing, we
brought the cause before a Chinese judge, who acted with
great impartiality : Having heard both fides, he asked the
Chinese man that went with me, whose servant he was?
-" Sir," said he," I am nobody's, but went with the
stranger at his request:" "Why then," said the judge,
•' you are the stranger's servant for the time, and the ca-
mel being delivered to Jiis servant, it is the same as though
delivered to himself, and accordingly he must pay for it,"
Indeed the case was so fairly stated, that,I had nothing to
object to it; so, having paid for that I was robbed of, I
sent for another, bnt did not go myself to fetch it, as I had
enough of that sport before.
The cLy of Naum is a frontier of the Chinese empire,
so fortified, as some will tell you, that millions of Tartars
cannot batter down their walls,; by which certainly one
might think one pf our cannons would do more execution
than all their legions.
When we were within a day's march of that city, we
had information that the governor had sent messengers to
every part ef tHe road, to inform the travellers and cara-
vans to halt, till a guard was sent to protect them from the
numerous.bodies of Tartars that lately appeared about the
city. This news put us into great consternation; but,
obeying the orders, we iiopt; and two days after, there^
came two hundred.soldiers from a garrison os the Chinese,
and three hundred more from Naum; thus guarded both
in the front and rear, with our own men in the flanks, we
boldly advanced, thinking we were able to combat with
ten thousand Mogul Tartars, if they appeared.
2%&~ XTFB AK© ADVENTTJHES
Early next morning, in our march from a little well situ-
ated town called Changu, aster having passed a river, and1
entered upon a desert os about fifteen or sixteen miles over,
we soon beheld, by a cloud of dust that was raised, that
the enemy was approaching. This much dispirited the
Chinese. My old pilot took notice os it, and called out,
44 Seignior Inglise, those fellows must heencouraged, or they
will ruin us alT; and I am afraid if the Tartars attack us,
they will all run away." t€ Why Seignior," said I, *' what
shall be done in this cafe?" «« Done," fays he, "why,
let fifty of our men advance, and flank them on each wing.
I know the fellows will fight well enough in company.**
We accordingly took his advice, and marched fifty to the
the right wing, and the fame number to the left, and with
the rest made a line of reserve, leaving the last two hun-
dred men to gtiard the camels, or to assist os, as occasion
required.
Thus prepared, a party of the enemy came forward,
viewing our posture, and traversing the ground on the front
of our line. Hereupon we ordered the two wings to move
on, and give them a salute with their Ihbt; which accord-
ingly was done. T!iis put a stop to their proceedings;
for immediately wheeling off to their left, they all marched
away, and we saw no more of them. They had undoubt-
edly given an account to their companions of what recep-
tion they might expect, which made them so easily give
ever their enterprize.
When we came to the city of Naum, we returned the
governor hearty thanks, and distributed a hundred crowns
among the soldiers that guarded us. We refitd there one
•day, and then proceeded on our travels, pasting several
great rivers and deserts; and on the 13th of Aprit we came
to'the frontiers of Muscovy, the strst town of which was
called Argon:
This happy occasion, as 1 thought, of coming into a
Christian country, made me congratulate the Scots mer-
chant upon it. Be smiled at that, telling me not to re-
joice too soon; •' for/* said he, "except the Ruffian
soldiers ir> garrison, and a sew inhabitants of the cities
upon the road, all-the rest of this country, for above a
thousand miles, is inhabited "by the mostignofant and bar-
barous Pagans/"
We advanced from the river Arguna, by moderate
tournies, and soJnd convenient garrisons oa the road, filled
.3
for the security of commerce, and
for she convenient lodgings of travellers: but the inhabi-
tant of the country were mere Pagans, worshiping the fun,
moon, and stars. We particularly observed this idolatry-
near the river . Arguna, at a city inhabited by Tartars and
Rusiians, called Nerifmkey. Being curious to fee their
way of living, while the caravan continued to rest them-
selves in that fcity, I went to one of their villages, where
there was to be one of their solemn sacrifices. There I
beheld, upon the slump of an old tree, an idol of wood,
more ugly than the representation of the devil himself: its
head resembled no living creature; it, ears were as big
and as high as goats* horns, a crooked nose, four-cornered
mouth, and horrible teeth: it was clothed in iheep skins,
had a greaj Tartar Bonnet, with two hornsgrowing thro*
it, and was eight feet high, without feet, legs, or propor-
tion. Before this idol their lay sixteen or seventeen peo-
ple, wh© brought their offerings, and were making their
prayers, while at a distance stood three men, and one bul-
lock, as victims to this ugly monster.
Such stupendous sacrilege as this, in robbing the true
God of his honour, filled me with the greatest astonish*-
went and reflection: which soon turning to rag€.and fury,
J rocje up to the image, and cut in pieces the bonnet that
was upon his head with my sword, so that it hung down
by one of the horns, while one of my men that was wi|h
me; pulled at it by his sheep skin garment. Immediately
an hideous howling and outcry ran through the village, and
two <^r three hundred people coming about our ears, w$
were obliged to sty for it.
But ] had not done with the monster; for the caravan
being to rest three nights in the town, I told the Scots mert«
chant what 1 had seen, and that I was resolved to take four*
or five, men well armed with me, in order to destroy the
idol, and show the people how little reason they had to trull-
in a god who could npt save himself. At first he laughed*
at rne* representing the danger of it, and when it was de-s
ftro^ed, what time had we to preach to them better things^/.
whose zeal and ignorance w,as in the highest degree, and
both ujiparal!?led I._ that jf I ihoulJ be taken by them, I a
should be served! as a poor ruffian, who contemned theic .
w 61 (hip ^ tj^at is, te be stripped naked, and tied to the
top of the idol, there (hot al wish arrows till my body was .
fsll ©f tnem; and then burnt as a sacrifice to the nenster;
L
"but Sir," said he, ** since your zeal carries you so far,
rather than you should be alone I will accompany you, arid
bring a stout feliow equal to yourself, if you will, to assist
you in this design: and accordingly he brought one Cap-
tain Richardson, who, hearing the story, readily-consented.;
but my partner declined it, being altogether out of his way:
and so we three, and my servant, reiolved, to execute this
exploit about midnight; but upon second thoughts we de-
ferred it to the next night, by "reason that the caravan be-
ing to go from hence the next morning, we ihould be out
of the governor's power. The better to effectuate my de-
sio-n> 1 procured a Tartar's sheep skin robe, a bonnet, with
bow and arrows, and every one-of us got the like habits.
The first night we spent in mixing combustible matter with
aqua vitæ, gunpowder, &c. having a good quantity os tar
in a little pot: next night we came up to the idol about
eleven o'clock, the moon being up. We found none guard-
ing it; but we perceived a light in the house, where we
had seen the priests before. One of our men was for firing
the hut, another for killing the people, and a third for ma-
king them prisoners, while'the idol was destroyed. We
agreed to the latter; so knocking at the door, we seized
the first that'opened it, and stopping his mouth and tying
his feet, we left him. We served the other two in the like
manner; and then the Scots merchant set fire to the com-
position, which frightened them so much, that we brought
them all away prisoners to their wooden god. There we
fell to work with him, daabing him all over with tar mixed
with tallow and brimstone, stopping his eyes, ears, and
mouth fall of gunpowder, with a great piece of wild-fire in
.his bonnet, and environed it with dry forage. All this
bein^ done, we unloosed and ungagged the prisoners, and
set the idol on fire, which the gunpowder blowing up, the
shape of it was deformed, rent, and split, which the forage
utterly consumed; for we staid to see its destruction, lest
the ignorant idolatrous people should have thrown them-
selves into the flames. And thus we came away undisco-
vered, in the morning appearing as busy among our fellow
travellers, as nobody could have suspected any other, but
that we had been in our beds all night.
Next morning we set out, and had gone but a small
distance from the city, when there came a multitude of
people of the country to the gates of the city, demanding
satisfaction of the Rufilan governor for insulting their priests,
and buraiag their great Cham Cbi-Tnaungu, v»ho dwelt
in the sun, and no mortal would violate this image but some
Christian miscreants; and being already no less than thirty
thousand strong, they announced war against him and ail
his Christians.
The governor assured them he was ignorant of the mat-
ter, and tha-t none of his garrison had been abroad; that in-
deed there was a caravan that went away that morning, and
that he would fend after them to i- quire into it; and who-
ever was the offender, should be delivered into their hands.
This satisfied them for the present, but the governor sent
to inform us, that if any of us had done it, we mould
make all she haste away possible, while he kept them in
play as. long as he could. Upon this we marched two days
and two night?, stopping but very little, till at last we ar-
rived at a village called Plothus, and hasted to Jerawenz,
another of the Czar's colonies. On the third day, having
entered the desert, and pasted the lake called Shaks Oser,
we beheld a numerous body of horse en the other side of it
to the north, who supposed we had passed en that side of
the lake; but either having found the mistake, or being
certainly informed of the way we took, they csroe upon.
us towards the dusk of the evening, just as we had
pitched our camp between two little but very thick woods,
with.a little river running before cur front and some felled
trees with which we coveted our rear; a precaution we
always took, and which we had just finistied when the ene-
my came up. They did ndt fall oh us immediately, but
sent three messengers, d mandi-ng the men who had insulted
tfceir priests, and burnt their god Cham Chi-TIiaungu,
tii at they might be burnt with fire; that if this was com-
plied with, they would peaceably depart; but if not, they
would destroy one and all of us. Our men stared at one
another ©n receipt of this message, but Nobody was the
word, as-indeed nobody knew it, but he who did it. Upon
which the leader of the caravan returned for answer, <* That
they were-peaceable merchants, who meddled withnoneof
their priests-and*gods; and therefore desired them not to
disturb us, and put us to the necessity of defending our-
selves." But'fo far was this from satisfying them, that the
cext mormin.g coming to our right, they let fly a volley of
arrowsamong- usT which happily did not hurt any, because
we sheltered carselves behind our baggage. We expected
\~> z
however to come to a closer engagement; but were happily
saved by a cunning fellow, a Cossack, who obtaining leave
of the leader to go out, mounts his horse, rides directly
-from our rear, and taking a circuit, comes up to the Tar-
tars, as though he had been sent express, and tells them a
formal story, that the wretches who had burnt the Cham
Chi-Thaungu, were gone to Shiheilka, with a resolution to
burn the god Shal-Isar, belonging to the Tongueses* Upon
which, believing this cunning Tartar, who was servant to
our Muscovites, away they drove to 6hiheiika, and in less
than three minutes were out of light, nor did we ever hear
cs them more.
When we came to the city of Jarawena, we rested five
days, and then entered into a frightful desert, which held
vs twerty-three days march, infested with several small
companies of robbers, or Mogul Tartars, who never had
t-ie courage to attack us. After we had passed over this
desert, we found several garrisons to defend the caravans
from the violence of the Tartars: In particular the Gover-
nor of Adinfkoy offered us a guard of fifty men to the next
station, if we apprehended any danger. The people here
retained the fame paganism and barbarity, only they were
not so dangerous, being conquered by the Muscovites.
The clothing, both of men and women, is of the skins of
beasts, living under the ground in vaults and caves, which
-have a communication with one another. They have idols
almost in every family; besides, they adore the fun and
stars, water and snow; and the least uncommon thing that
happens in the elements, alarms them as much as thunder
and lightning does the unbelieving Jews.
Nothing remarkable occurred in our march through this
country. When we had gone through the desert, after two
days farther travel, we came to Jenezoy, a Muscovite city,
on the great river so called, which we were told parted Eu-
rope from Asia. The inhabitants here were very little bet-
ter, though intermixed with the Muscovites, but the won-
der will cease, when I inform my reader of what was ob-
served to me, that the Czar rather converts the Tartars
with soldiers than clergymen, and his more proud to make
them faithful subjects, than good Christians.
From this city to the river Oby, w*e travelled ©ver n
pleasant, fruitful, but very unc»luvate4 country, for want
of good management and people, and those few are mostly
BagajRf*-- This is the place where the Muscovite criminate
are Vanished to, if they are not put to death. The next city'
we-ioanae to; was the capital city of Siberia, called Tobol-
fki, wien having been-almoJI seven months on ourjournev,
a**4 winter drawing on apace,- roy partner and I consulted-
about our particular affairs, in what manner we should dis-'
poiie of ourselves* We'had'hsen told of (ledges and rein-
deer to carry us over the snow in the Winter season, the:
snow being frozen so hard, that the fledges can r-.m upon''
the surface without any danger of going down. As 1 was
bound to England, i now behoved either to go with the
caravan to Jeroilaw, from thence well to M;rva, and the'
gulf of Finland, and so by land or sea to Denmark; or
else I must leave the caravan-at a little town on the Dvvina,
and so to Archasgel, where 1 was certain-os snipping either^
to England, Holland, or Hamburgh* One night 1 hap-
pened to"get imo the company cf an illustrious, but ba-
nished Prince, whose company and virtues were such as
made me to propose to him a method how he might obtain*
his liberty. <4 My dear friend," said he, ** as I am here*
happily free from my.miserable greatness, with all its at-
tendants of pride, ambition, avarice, and luxury, if 1 should V.
escape from this place, those pernicious feeds may again
revive, to my lasting disquietude; therefore let me remain7
in a blessed confinement, for i am but Rests, a mere man,'
with passions and affections as such; O be not my friend
and. .tempter too I? Struck dumb with surprise, 1 Hood silent-
a-while; nor was- he-less in disorder, by which perceiving-
he wanted to give vent to his-mind, I-desired h m to con-
flderofit, and so withdrew. But about- two hours after he
cam^ to my apartment: "Dear friend, ' said he, " though-
I capnot consent to accompany you, I shall have this satis
factj£>;& in parting, that you leave me an honest man lull; *
htH&s a testimony.of my aiT^dion ta yoii, be pleased to ac-*

gules distant frcm him, on the other fide of the city, \tfrom
he (aid he would fend for, if f gave my consent. This I
spon complied with; upon which he sent his servants next
4ay for his son, who returned in twenty days time, bring-
ing seven horses loaded with valuable furs. At night the
young Lord was conducted incognito into our apartment,
where his father presented him to me. We then concerted
the best ways for travelling, and after having boughs a
considerable quantity of sables, bbck fox skins, fine ermines,
&rc. (which I fold at Archangel at a good price) we set
out from this city the beginning of June, making a small
caravan, being about thirty-two horses and camels, of which
I represented the head. My young Lord had with him a
very faithful Siberian servant, well acquainted with the
xoads: We shunned the principal towns and cities, as Tu-
men, Soli-Kemo&oi, and several others, by reason of their
strictness in examining travellers, lest any of the banished
periods of distinction should escape. Having passed the
river Kama, we came to a city on the European side, called
So'oy Kamofkti, where we found thepepple mostly Pagans,
as before. We then pasted a desert of about two hundred
miles over; bat in other places it is near seven hundred.
jn passing t.iis wild place, we were beset by a troop of men
on horseback, and about iive and forty men armed with
bows and arrows. At first they locked earnestly on us,
and then placed themselves in our way. We were above
sixteen men, and drew up a little line before our camels.
My young Lord sent out his Siberian servant, to know who
they were; but, when he approached them, he neither
knew a word they said, nor would they admit him to come
near them at his peril, but prepared to (hoot him. At his
return, he told us he believed them to be Calmuck Tar-
tars; and th-.t there were more upon the desert. I his was
but a small comfort to us; yet seeing a little grove, about
a quarter of a mile's distance, we moved to it, by the old
Portuguese pilot's advice, without meeting with any opp'o-
-" ftfion. Here we found a marshy- piece of ground, and a
fpr-ing of water running.into a little brook oi\_one fide,
^hich joined another like it a little farther off, and these
two formed the head,of the. river called Writfca. As soon
as we.arrived, we went to work, cutting great arrrts off the
trees,, and laying them hanging (not quite off. from-one
, tree to another. In tiis situation we waited true motion of
lie Vaemy? wi'thaat perceiving any axhraJifc&Ue'ft? ttoey'Rtad*
swards .us. About two hours, before night, being jorned
bv some others, in all about fourscore horse, amon^whotfi
we fancied were some women, they came.upon us w.itn great
fury. We fired without ball, calling to them in the Ruf-
fian tongue, to know their. Business;, but they, either not
knowing* or seeming not to understand us, came directly
to the wood fide, not'considering.that we were; so fortified,
as that they could not break in. Our. old pilot, the Por-
tuguese, proved both our captain and engineer, and de-
sired us not to sire, till they carae vvithing pistol shot; and
when he gave the word of command, then to v±kc, tae
surest aim: but he did net bid us give fire, till they were
within two pikes length of us, and then we killed fourteen
of them, wounded several, as also their horses, .haying
every one of us loaded our pieces with two or three bul-
lets at least. So much were they surprised^ at our un-
dauntedness, that they retired about a hundred roods from
us. In the mean while we loaded our pieces again, and
sallying out, secured four or five of their horses, whose
riders we found were killed, and perceived them to be
Tartars. About an hour after, they made another attempt,
to fee where they rn'ght break in; but finding us ready .to
receive them, they retired.
Ail that night we wrought hard, in strengthening our
situation, and barricading the entrances into the woods;
but when day-light came, we had a very unwelcome dis-
covery; for the enemy, being encouraged by their num-
bers, had set up eleven or twelve tents, in form of a camp,
about three quarters of a mile from us. I must: confess, I
was never more concerned in my life, giving myself and
all that I had over for lost. And my partner declared,
that ^5 the loss of his goods would be his ruin, before they
should be taken from him, he would fight to the last drop of
his, blood. As we could not pretend to force our way, we
had recourse to a stratagem ; we kindled a large fire, which,
burnt all night; and no sooner was it dark, but we pursued
our journey towards the pole, or north star, and travelling
all night; by fix o'clock in the morning we came to a Rui-
fian village, called Kertza, and from thence came to a large
town named Ozonzoys, where we heard that several troops
of Calmuck Tartars had been abroad upon the deiert; but
that we were past all danger, in five days after we came
to Veujlinia, upon the river Witzedga; from thence we
came to Lawren&oy, on the third of July, where, provid-

dividing our effects, my share came to .3475L 173. 3d; a£
ter all the losses we had sustained, and charges we had been
at. Here the young Lord took his leave of"roe, in order
to go to the court of Vienna, not only to seek protection;
bat to correspond with his father's friends. After we hid
staid four months in Hamburgh, 1 went from thence over
Lmd to the Hague, where embarking in the packet, I ar*
jived in London the 10th of January 1705, after ten years
and nine months absence from England.
VISION of the Angelic World.
Chap. I. Of SOLITUDE.
HOWEVER solitude is looked upon ns a restraint to the
pleasure of the world, in company and conversation,
yet it is a happy state of exemption from a sea of trouble,
an inundation of vanity and vexation, of confuiion and dis-
appointment. While we evijoy ourselves, neiu.er the joy
nor sorrow of other men affect us; We are then at liberty,
with the voice of our foul, to speak to God. By this we
shun such frequent trivial discourse, as often becomes an ob-
struction to virtue: and how often do we find that we had
reason to vvisti we had not been in company, or said nothing
when we were there? for either we offend God by the im-
piety of our discourse, or lay ourselves Open to the violence
of designing people by our unguarded expressions; and fre-
quently feel the coldness and treachery of pretended friends,
when once involved in trouble and astiiction T of (ach un-
faithful intimates (I should say enemies, who rather by false
inuendoes would accumulate miseries upon us, than honest-/
Jy afiilt us when under the hard hand of adversity, Bat
ife.*a- state *>f* solitude, wljen our tongues c*nnot be heir df\
except-from'the great Mijesty of Heaven, how happy are*
we, in the blessed enjoyment of conversing' with our Ma-
ker! It is then we make htm our friend, which sets utf
above *hz envy and contempt of wicked men. When a
ma*i converses with himself, he is fare that he does not-
converse with ai\ enemy. Our retreat "mould be to good •
company, and gaod books I mean not by solitude, that
a man should retire into a cell, a desert, or-a monastry:'
which would be altogether an useless and unprofitable re-
straint: for as men are formed for society, and have an *
absolute neceility and dependence upon one* another; so *
there is a retirement of the foul, with which it converses iit -
heaven, even in the mioMt of men; and indeed no man is
more fit to speak freely, than he who can;' without any
violence himself, refrain his tongue, or keep silence al-
together. As to religion* it is by this the foul gets ac*
quainted with the hidden mysteries of the holy-writings;
here ihe finds those stood*of tears, in which good men wash
themselves day and nights and only makes a visit to God,
and his holy angels, in this conversation the truest: peace
and moll solid joy are to be found; it is a continual feast
of contentment on earth, and the means of attaining ever*
lasting happiness in heaven.
Chap. 31. Of HONESTY.
Honesty is a virtue beloved by good men, and pretended
to by all other persons. In this there are several degrees:
to pay every man his own is the common law of honesty:
but to do good to all mankind, is the chancery law of hr-
nesty; and this chancery court is in every man's breast,
where his conscience is a Lord Chancellor. Hence it is,
that a miser, though he^pays every body their -own, can-
not be-a honest man, when he does not discharge the good
offices that are incumbent on a friendly, kind, and- gene-
rous person* for, faith the prophet Isaiah, chap, xxxii.
ver. 7, 8. «* The instruments of a churl are evil: he de-
viCeth wicked devices to destroy the poor with lying word?,
even when the needy speaketh right. But the liberal soul
deviseth liberal things, and by liberal things shall he
sta-Rd." It is certainly honest to do every thing the law
reejaires; but siiould we throw every poor debtor into pri*--
soa: till he has paid the utmost farthing, hang every male-

factor without mercy, exact the penalty of every bond; and
the forfeiture of every^ indenture, this would be downright
cruelty, and not hcmest}*: and it i-s contrary to that general
rule, "To do to another, that which you would have done
unto you." Sometimes necessity makes an honest* man a
knaves and a rich man a honest matv because: he-has;no
occasion to be a knave. The trial of hoaefly is thisz- I>id
you ever want bread, and had your neighbour's loaf m
keeping, and would starve rather than eat it? Were you
^ver arrested, having in your custody another man's cash,
and would rather go to gaol, than break it? if so,, this in-
deed may be reckoned honesty* For King S; Jomon tells
us, f( That a good name is better than lire*, and isa pre-
cious ointment, and which, when a man has*once loll, he
has nothing left worth keeping."
C B a p. I IljL Of the present safe of ReligivK in the <wzrld*
I doubt, indeed, there is much more devotion than re-
ligion in the world, more adoration than supplication, and
more hypocrisy than sincerity; and it is very melancholy
to consider, what numbers of people there are' furnished-
with the powers of reason and gifts-of nature, and yet
abandoned to the grossest ignorance.and depravity; Itotit*
would be uncharitable for us to imagine (as some Papists,
abounding with too much ill. nature,, the- only scandal to
religion, do) that they will certainly be in a state of dam-
nation after this life; fan how can we think it consistent
with the mercy and'goodness"of an infinite Being, todamii1
those creature, when he has not: furnished them with the
light of the gospel?' orh'ow scan-sock proud, conceited;
and cruel bigots, prescribe rudes to the justice and merey
of God?
We aretold^by some people, that the great image whkh
King Nebuchadnezzir set up to be adored by. his people
held the representation of the sun in its right hand, as the
principal object of adoration. But>to wave this discourse of
Heathens, how many-self-contradicting, principles*are ther^
held among Christians?: and how da we doom-one another
to the devil, while all profess to worihip^ the fame Deity;
and to expect the fame salvation?
When 1 was at Portugal, there was held at that time
thecourt of justice of the inquisition; AH the-criminate
were carried in procession to the great church, where eight
sbf them were nabited in gowns and caps of canvas, where
on the torments of hell were displayed, and they were con-
demned and burnt for crimes against the Catholic faith
and blessed Virgin*
J am sorry to make any reflection upon Christians.; but,
indeed, in Italy the Roman religion seems the most cruel
and mercenary upon earth; and a very judicious person^
who travelled through Italy from Turkey, tells, si That
** there is only the face and outward pomp, of religion
"there: that the church protects murderers and ailaffins;
"and then delivers the civil magistrate over to Satan for
<{ doing justice; interdicts whole kingdoms, and {huts up
ft the churches for want of paying a few ecclesialiical dues,
** and so puts a stop to religion for want of their money;
<c that the court of Inquisition burnt two men for speakings
«' dishonourably of the Blessed Virgin; and the miSiona-
is ries of China tolerated the worshipping the devil by their
"new converts: that Italy was the theatre, where religion
"was the grand opera; and that the Popish clergy were
'* no other than the stage players." . , ,
, As to religion in Poland, they deny Christ to be the
Messiah, or that the Messiah has come in the flesh. And
ass to their Protestants, the,y are .the followers of Lælius
Socinus, who denied our Saviour's divinity; and have no
cor.cern about the divine inspiration of the Holy Ghosts.
In Muscovy their churches are built of wood, and, hi-
4eed, they have but wooden priests,, though of the Greek
church; they prey as much to St, Nicholas, as the Papists
do to trie-Virgin Mary, for protection in all their difficul-
ties or ai?ucti«ns.
As to Lutherans, they only differ from the Roman's ia
believing consubstantiation, instead of transubstandation;
but, like them, they are much pleased with the external
gallantry and pomp, more than the true and real practice
of it. )
Jn France I found a world of priests, the streets every
where crowded with them, and the churches full of women:
mt surely never was a nation so full of blind guides, so ig-.
norant of religion, and even as void of mortals, as those
people who Confess their fins to them
.Does it not seem rl range, that, while all men own the
Divine Being,..there should be so many different opinions
ai.to the manner of paying him obedience in the Christian*
chunm? I know not what reason to assign for this, except
it be their different"capacities arid faculties..
And, indeed, upon this account, we have perceived, in
all Christian countries, what mortal feuds have been about
religion; what win and bloodshed have molested Europe,
till the general pacification of the German troubles at the
treaty of Westphalia; and since those times, what persecu-
tion in the same country among the churches of the Luthe-
rans; and should I take a prospect at home, what unhappy
divisions are between Christians in this kingdom, about
Episcopacy and Presbytery; the church of England
2nd the Dissenter? opposing one another like St. Paul and
St. Peter, even t6 the face ; that is, they carry on the dis-
pute to the utmost extremity.
It might be a question, why there are such differences-nT
religious points, and why these breaches should be more hot-
and irreconcileable? All the answer I can give to this, is,
that we inquire more concerning the truth of religion, than
any other nation in the world; and the anxious concern we
have about it, makes us jealous of every opinion, and tena-
cious of our'own; and this is not because we are more fu-
rious and rash than other people; but the truth is, we are
more concerned about them, and being sensible that the
scripture is the great nde if faith, the standard for life and
doctrine, we have recourse to it ourselves, without submit-
ting to any pretended infallible judge upon earth.
There is another question, pertinent to the former, and
that is, What remedy can we apply to this malady? And to
this I must negatively answer, No: to be less religious, that
we may differ the less. This is striking at the very root of
hll religious differences; for, certainly, were they to be
carried on with a peaceable spirit, willing to be informed,
our variety of opinions would not have tne name of differ-
ences;; nor ihould we separate in c mmunion of charity,
though we did not agree in several articles of religion.
Nor is there a less useful question to start, namely, Where
will our unhappy religious differences end? To which, I
hope, ?may answer, in Heaven; there all unchristian and
unbrotherly differences will rind a period; there we mall
embrace many a limner, that here we think it a dishonour
to converse with;and perceive many a heart we have bro-
ken here withcenhjres, reproaching*, arid revilings,, made
whole again by the balm of the fame Redeemer's blood.
liere we shall perceive there have been other flocks, thaa,
those of our fo'd; thart those we have excommunicated have
been taken into that superior communion; and, in a word,
thit those contradicting notions and priuciples which we
thought inconsistent with true religion, we ihall then rind
reconcileabie to themselves, to one another, and to the
fountain of truth if any man ask. me, Why our defer-
ences cannot be ended on earth? I answer, Were we all
thoroughly convinced, that then they would be reconciled,,,
we would put an en4 to them before; but this is iropomble
to be done; for as men's certain convictions of truth are
not equal to one another, or the weight or fignificancy of
such veracity; so neither can a general effect of this aifair
be expected on this side of time.
Before 1 conclude this chapter, I shall beg leave to dis-
course a little of the wonderful excellency of negative re-
ligion and negative virtue. The latter sets out, j.ke the
Pharisee, wi;h, God, 1 thank thee; it is a piece of religi-
ous pageantry, the hypocrice's hope: and, i\ a word, it
is positive vice: for it is either a mask to deceive others,
or a mist to deceive ourselves A man that is ciothed wiih ,
negatives, thus argues: I am not such a drunkard as try
landlord, such a thi.-f as my tenant, luch a iwearer as his
neighbour; neither am I a cheat, an. atheist, a rakish fel-
low, or a highwayman; no! 1 live a sober, regular, re-
tired life: 1 am a good man, 1 go.to church; God. i thank
thee. Now, though a man b -aits of his virtue in contra-
diction to the vices mentioned, yet a perlon had baiter have
them altogether than the man himself; for he is so full of
himself, lo persuaded that he is good and religious enough
already, that he has no thoughts of any thing, except it be
to pull off his hat to God Almighty now and then, and
thank him that he has no occasion for him; and has the
vanity to think ihat his neighbours must imagine well of
him too.
The negative man, though he is no drunkard, is yet in-
toxicated with the pride of his own v.orth; a gocd neigh-
bour a-nd peace-maker in other families, but a tyrant in his
own; appears in church for a show, but never falls upon
his knees in his closet; does all his alms before men, to be
seen of them; eager in the duties of the second table, but
regardless of the first; appears religious, to be taken no-
tice of by meni b.u without imercourie or communkation
between God arid his owq foul: Fray, what is this, man ?-
or what;corhforf is 'there of the life he lives? he is insen-
2J4- LtFE A&D AT>YE'kFtXJRis
fible of faith; repentance, and a Cnristian mortified life,*
in a word, he is perfectly a stranger to the essential part of
religion.
Let us for a while enter into the private and retired part
of his conversation: What notions has he of his mispeut
hours, and of the progress of time to the great centre and
gulph of life, eternity? Does he know how to put a right
value on time, of esteem the life-blood of his foul, «as it
really is, and act in all the moments of it, as one that must
account for them? if then you can form an equality be-
tween what he can do, and what he (hall receive; less can
be founded upon his negative virtue, or what he has for-
borne to do: And if neither his negative nor positive piety
can be equal to the reward, and to the eternity that reward
is" to last for, what then is to become of the Pharisee, when
he is to be judged by the sincerity of his repentance, and
rewarded, according to'the infinite grace of God, with a
state of blessedness to an endless eternity?
When the negative man converses with the invisible
World, lie is filled with as much horror and dread as Felix,
when St. Paul' reasoned to him of temperance, righteous-
ness, and of judgment to come; for Ftlix, though a great
philosopher, of great power and reverence, was a negative
man, and he was made sensible by the Apostle, that, as a
life of virtue and temperance was its own reward, by giving
a healthy body, a clear head, and* a composed life, so eter-
nal happiness mull proceed from another spring; namely,
the infinite unbounded grace of a provoked God, who hav-
ing erected a righteous tribunal, Jesus Christ would sepa-
rate such as by faith and repentance he had brought home
arid united to himself by the grace of adoption, and on the
foot of his having laid do-vn his life as a ransom for them,
ha*d appointed them to salvation, when all the philosophy,
temperance, and righteousness in the world besides h^d
been ineffectual. And1 this, i fay, it was, that made Felix,
this negative man tremble.
Chap. IV. Os listening to the voice of Ffovidence'.
"The'magnificent and wise king Solomon bids us cry as1

by which'is meant, religious knowledge; for it follows^
*fc Then malt thou underhand the fear of the Lord*
and' simi the'knowledge of G3d," -By winch' undoubtedly*

ft»e\ ntein^. t» infuire after every thing he has permitted
us to know, ami n.t to search into those ways that are un-
searchable, and are effectually locked up from our know
ledge:—Now, "as listening to the voice of Providence"*"
is my present subject, i intend, in the first place, to write
to those who own, 1. That there is a God, a first great
moving cause of ail things, and eternal power, prior, and'
consequently superior to all created power or being.-*—
2: That this eternal power, which is God, is the sovereign
creator and governor of heaven and earth.
To avoid all* needless distinctions, what persons in the
Godhead exercise th? creating, and what the governing
power, J offer that glorious text,- Pstl xxiii. 6. where the
whole Trinity is entitled to the whole creating work: and
therefore, in the next place, I shall lay down these two
propositions.
i. I hat the eternal God guides, by his providence, the
whole universe, which was created by his power.
II. That this* providence manifests a particular care over,
and concern in, the governing and directing man, the moil
noble creature upon earth.
It is plain, that natural religion proveYthe first, by inti-
mating the nectstity of a providence guiding and govern-
ing- the world, from the consequence of the Wisdom justice,
prescience, and goodness of the Almighty Creator: for
otherwise it woxild.be absurd to think, that God fhouid'
create a world, without any care or providence over it, in
guiding the operations of nature, so as to preserve the or-
der of his creation.
Revealed religion gives us a Hghtintb the care and con-
cern of his providence, by the climate's being made habi-
table, the creatures subjected and1 made nouriihing, and all
vegetative life mad« medicinal; and allthis for the fake of
man, who is made viceroy to the King of the earth. The
short description I shall give of providence is this-; "That
it is that operation of the power, of the wisdom, justice,
and goodness' of God^ by which he influence's, governs,
add directs, not only the means, but the event's of ail
things, which concern us in this sublunary world; the so-
vereignty, of which we ought always to reverence, obey its!
motions, observe its dictates, and listen-to its voice The*5
prudent man foreseeth the evil, and hideth himself; that is-, i
as I take it* there is a secret providence intimates to us,
that some danger threatens, if we strive not to iliun it."
25$,..... LI*E AN a AUVEKTUKIi
The same-day that Sir John Hotham kept out-HuM"
against the royal martyr King Charles I. the fame day vSir^
John Hotham was put to death by the parliament for that
very action: The fame day-that the King himself signed the
warrant for. the execution of the Earl of Stafford, the feme-
day of the month was he barharouily murdered by the blood-
thirsty Giiverian crew: and the fame day thn King James -.
II. came to the crown against the bill of exclusion, the fame-
day he was voted abdicated by the parliament, and the
throne fii'ed with King William and Queen Mary.
The voice of signal deliverances from sudden dangers, is
not only a just call to repentance, bat a camion against fall-
ing into the like danger; but such who are utterly careless •
of themselves after, ihow a lethargy of the.worst nature,
which seems to me to be.a kind of practical atheism, or at
Jeast a living in a contempt of Heaven, when he receives
gpod at the hand«cf his Maker, but is unconcerned from
whence it comes, or to thank-the bountiful hand that gave
it; neither, when he receives evil, does it alter his manner
of life, or bring him to any state of humiliation.
We have a remarkable story of two soldiers being con-
demned,to death in Pknders. The general being prevailed
upon to (p>\re one of them, ordered them to cast dice upon *
the drum head for their lives; the first having thrown two
sixes, the second fell a wringing his hands, having io poor
a chance to escape; however, having thrown, he was sur-
prised when he also threw other two fixes. The officer
appointed to fee the execution, ordered them to throw
again; they did so, and each of them t?hrew fives; at-
which the soldiers that stood round, shouted, and said,
neither of them was to die. Upon this, the osticer ac- •
q gain ted the council of war, who ordered th^m to throw a
third time, when they threw two fours: the.General being ,
acquainted with it, sent for the men, and pardoned them:
I love, said he, in such extraordinary cases, to -listen-to- the
voice of Providence.
We read in the holy writings, how God speaks to men
by appearance of angels, or by dreams and visians of the
night. As God appeared to Abraham, Lot, and Jacob:
so angels have appeared to many in other eases, as to Ma-
noah and his wife, Zechariah, the Virgin Mary, and to
the apostrles* others have been warned in a dream, as king
Abimelech, the false prophet Balaam, -atxj many others.
It is certainly a Very great aid rioote inquiry, " What we -
shall* be after this 1 ife?'' for there is scarce a doubt, that
there is* a place reserved for the reception of our souls after
death: for if we are to be, we must have a where, which
theTcriptures assert by the examples of Dives and Lazarus,
Lihe doctrine of spirits was long believed before our Sa-
viour's time; for when the diiciples of the blessed jcfus
perceived our Saviour walking en the sea, they were as
much surprised as though they had seen a spirit. Nay, in
those ages of the world, it was believed that spirits inter:
meddled in the affairs of mankind; and, throughout the
Old Testament, I do not find any thing that in the least
contradicts it. All the pains and labour that some learned
men have taken, to confute the story of the witch of End or,
and the appearance of an old man personating Samuel,
cannot make such apparitions inconsistent wiih nature or
religion; and it is plain, that it was either a good cr bad
spirit, tint prophetically told the unfortunate king what
fnould happen the next day; for, laid the spirit, *» The
"Lord will deliver thee into the hands of the Philistines;
** and to-morrow shalt thou and thy sons be with me."
Abur.dar.ee of strange notions possessed me, wbfn J was
in the desolate iiland; esp cially on a moonshine night,
when every bush f-emed a man, and every tree a man on
horseback \v hen 1 crept into the dismal cave where the'
old goat Jay expiring, whose articulate groans even resem-
bled those of a man. how was 1 surprised 1 my blood chil-
led in my veins, a cold sweaty dew fat on my forehead,
my hair stood upright, and mv joints, like balstuzzar'?
knees, struck against one another. And, indeed, the ugh I
afterwaros so nd what it was, the remains of this surprise
did not wear ess for a great while; and 1 had frequently
returns of those, vapours on different occasions, ana some-
times without a^y occasion at all.
One night, after having seen sorneappearar.ee in the air,.
as j had just lain down in my bed, one of my feet pained
me; after that came a numbnefs, succeeded with a tingling

lay upon me, frcjUt my knee to above half rry leg. Upon
this J. flung myself out of bed where ! thought the creature,
lay; but .finding nothing, "Lord d liver me from an
evil spirit,'',iaid 1, "what can this be?" When 1 lighted
a candle, i could perceive no liying creatur* in the place
with me, but ihe poor parrot, who being frighted, ca****
but, » Hold your tongue," and " What's the matter w,itk
you?*' which words 1 had taught: him, by fay ug so to km,

1 began plainly to see it was a distemper that.affected my
fierves, and so my terrors vanished at once.
How intelligences are given or received, we do not know;
hor are we sensible how they are conveyed from spirits em-
bodied to ours that are in life; or, dn the contrary, from
fas to them; the latter is certainly done without the help ot
the organs, "and the former is conveyed by the understand*
ine, and the retired faculties of the foul.
The spirits, viihout the help of voices, converse, and the
more particular discoveries of converse of the spirits, seem
to me as follow: to wit, dreams, voices, noises, irapuues,
hints, apprehensions, involuntary sadness, &c.
Dreams of old were the ways by which God himself was
pleased to warn men what services to perform, and what to
shun. Joseph was directed of God in a dream to go to
Eevpt; and so were the wise men warned m a dream to
depart into their own country another way, to avoid the
fury of H-rod. I am not like those who think dreams are
the rnere'designs-of a delirious head, Or the reacs of a
day's perplexities-or pleasures; but, on the contrary, I
rhuil beg leave to fay, I never met with any capital mil-
chief in my life, But I had some notice of it by a dream;
and had 1 not been a thoughtless unbebevmg creature, I
might have taken many a warning, and avoided many of
the evils I afterwads fell into, merely by total neglect of
those dreams. ... 1 v 4 »
I was once present at a dispute between a Uymao and a
clersymart,. upon the subject of dreams. I he first thought

pkin, andw&t by allegories and emblematic fancies, %x-
p$e&ing things imperfect and obscure* 2. Since, with the
notice of evil, there was not a power given to avoid it, it
is not likely to proceed from a spirit, but merely fortuitous.
3. That the inconstancy of such notices, in cafes equally
important, proves they did not proceed from any such
agent. 4. That as our most distinct dreams had nothing
ie them of any sigmficancy, it would be irrational and vain
to think that they came from heaven. And, 5. That as
men were not always thus warned or supplied with notice if
good or evil, so all men are not alike supplied with them;
and what reason could we give, why one man or one wo-
man should not have the fame hints as another?
To all this the clergyman gave answer: 1. That as to
the signification of dreams, and the objections against them,
as being dark and doubtful, they are expressed generally
by hierogliphical representations, similies, alluiioris, and
figurative emblematic ways, by which means, for want of
interpretation, the thing was not understood, and, conse-
quently, the evil not shunned. 2. That we charge God
foolishly, to say, that he has given the notice of evil* with*
out the power to avoid it; for, if any one had not power
to avoid the evil, it was no notice to him; and it was want
of giving due heed to that notice, that men first neglected
themselves, and then charged the judge of ail the earth
with injustice. 3. That we ought not to find fault with
the inconstancy of these notices; but rather with our weak
understandings, by pretending dreams were not to be
regardedT and negligent when the voice really spoke to us
for our good. It is a mistake to fay, dreams have no im-
port at ail: we might, with m6re reason, have said, nche
that we could-perceive the reason df, owing to our bhndræis
and supine neglige^ae? too secure at one time, and too
moefe alarmed at another; so that the spirit, which we
raigh* be said to be conversing with in a dream, was con-
stantly and equally khfid and careful; but our powers are
not always in the fame state of action, hot equally atten-
tive t©, or reteiitk^af the hints that were gtvVn. And,

One time my fincy soared on high, to see what disco-
veries I could make in t ho re clearer regions. I found, that,
such immense bodies as the fun, stirs, planets, and moon,
in the great circle of the lower heaven, are far from beings
found in the study of nature on the surface of the eartin
Were 1 saw many things that we cin entertain little-or,no.
notion of, in a state of common life, and the emptiness of
cur nation, that the planets are habitable world>; that is,
created like ours, for the subsistence and existence of man
and beast, and the preservation of the vegetative and sen*
sative life: No, no, this is* I assure yon, a world of spirits y
for here I saw a-clear demonstration of Satan being the
prince of the. power of the air, keeping his court or camp,
with innumerable angels to attend him; but his power is
not so great as- we imagine, he can tempt us to the crime,
but cannot force us to commit: Humanum estpeccare. Nei-
ther, has. the devil power to force the world into a rebellion
against heaven, though his legions are'employed among
(dvage nations to set vp their master for a god, who make;
the heathens either woririip him in person, or by his repre-
sentatives^ idoJs arid monsters, with the cruel sacrifices of

that I learned a way how to make a man dream of what I
:c;^ r o 8 in son c r u sofi. t6f
pleased. For jnstance, let us suppose one to be sound asleep;
let another lay his mouth close to his ear, and whisper any
thing so softly as not to -awake him, the sleeping man shall
dream of vihat has been so whiCpered in hh ear; nay, I can
assure you, those insinuating devils* can do this even when
we are awake, which I call impulses os the mind: for from
whence, but from these insinuators, come™our causeless pas-
sions, involuntary wickedness, or sinful: desires? Who else
form ideas in the mind of man when he is.asleep, or pre-
sent terrible or beautiful figures to hrs fancy? Mr. Milton
represents the devil tempting Eve in the shape of a toad,
lying just at her ear, when in her bower she lay fast asleep;
and b.ings in Eve telling Adam what an uneasy night's
rest she' had, and relating her dream to him. And likewise
I believe that good spirits have the fame intercourse with
us, in warning us against those things that are evil, and
prompting us to.that which is good.
Were we to have the eyes of our fouls opened, through
the eyes of our bodies, we should fee this very immediate
region of air which we breathe in, thronged with spirits
now invisible, and which otherwise would be the most ter-
rible; we should view the secret transactions of those mes-
sengers who are employed when the parting foul takes its
leave of the reluctant body, and perhaps fee things nature
would shrink back from with the utmost terror and amaze-
ment. In a word, the curtain of Providence for the dis-
position os things here, and the curtain of judgment for
the determination of the state of fouls hereafter, would be
alike drawn back; .and what heart conld support here its
future state in life; much less that of its future state after
life, even good or bad.
A gentleman of my acquaintance, being about fe vest
miles distant from London, a friend that came to dine with
him, solicited him to go to the city* M What," said the
gentleman, " is there any occasion for me?" «* No, Sir,**
laid the other, "nothing at all, except the enjoyment of
your goed company ." and &> gave over importuning him.
Just then a strong impulse of mind urged the gentleman,
and pursued hm like a voice, withy a G° to Loiidon; 6to
to Ltkdbn^V */ Hark ye*" says he to his Mend; 4* is al!
well at London^ Am I wanted there f dr* did your ask
me i& go withi you ojjany particular account * Are all
my fSnÆ)f wells" "Yes, indeed, Sir," said he, "I per-
ceived them aH very hearty \ and i did norai: yon to J;b
to London upo& any particular account whatsoever, except
it w as= for the sak e of your goo d com pan y.'' A gain he put
off his resolution: bat Hill the impulse suggested to him,
,4 Go to London;" and at length he did fa. When he
came there, he found a letter and a messenger had been
there to seek him, and to tell him of a particular business,
which was at first and last above a thousand pounds to. him,
and which might inevitably have been lost,-had he nos
gone to London that night.
The obeying of several hints, or secret impulses, argues
great wisdom. 1 knew a man that was under mi -fortunes,
being guilty of misdemeanors against the government;
when, absconding for fear, of his ruin, all his friends ad-
vising iim not to put himself in the hands of the law^ one
morning as he awaked, he felt a strong impulse darting in-
to, his mind thus, *; Write a letter to them;" and this was
repeated several times to his mind, and as last he answered*
t# it, as if it had been a voice, " Whom shall i write to?"
Immediately it,replied, "Write to the Judge:" and this
impulse pursued him for several days, tillat length he took
pen, ink, and paper, and fat down to. write to him:
when immediately words flowed from his; pea, like streams
from a fair fountain, that charmed.even himselfwith hopes
of success. In (hort, the letter was so strenuous in argu-
ment, so pathetic in itseloquence,,andsQ persuasively mov-
ing, that when, the judge had read it, he sent him an an-
swer he-might be easy, he, would endeavour to make, that
master light to him ; ar*d,;indeed, never left exerting him-
self, tili he had stop* the prosecution, and. restored him to
hb liberty and family.
While I am mentioning these things* methinksit is very
hard that. we«should obey the whispers of. evil spirits, and
«pt much rather, receive? the notices, which, good ones are
pleased to give. We never perceive the misforttme ofrthi^
butwheiv in real dagger; aud. then we cry*, "My mi»d
mjigave me when I was going aJbout it;" bat-if so, why
da you llight, the.caation? Why; not listea to, it as to-a
voice? and.ttien there* had been no reason,ta make- this
complains,
L remember*about fouxteca. or fifteen.'years ago :(a*-to

man^ in* the^cky o£I3abiio» irr Ireland^, wker dreamed: a very
^uncommoi^dijeaifni Thalia, gec&leman; had killed- his wife,
a,rel^$iQa^ofh^ l^fstaj)biag;hei4 mi se^eraL; places * the
fright of this awaked him, but finding it a dream, he com-
posed himself again to sleep, when he dreamed a second
time the same dream. This made him a litti-e uneasy;
but thinking it proceeded from the impression made oh his
mind by the former,, he went to sleep again, and dreamed
the fame dream a third time also. So troubled was he at
this, that he arose, and knocked at his mother's chamber,
told his concern, and his apprehensions that all was not
right at his relation's house. "Dear son," says the good
old gentlewoman, (i do not mind those foolish dreams;
and 1 very much wonder, that you^ being a person in holy
orders, should have regard to fhch allusions." Upon this
he-went to bed again, fell asleep, and dreamed a fourth
time as before. And then indeed he put on his night-
gown, and went to Smith field, the place where his rela-
tion dwelt. Here it was, alas 1 he perceived his dream
too sadly fulfilled, by seeing his relation the young lady,
big with child, who was a Protestant, stabbed in several
-places by her barbarous husband, Mr. Eustace, a violent
Papist, only for some discourses of religion that happened
the day before. After the wretch had stabbed her in three
places, he went to make his escape out at a window; but
she cried out, u My dear! don't leave me, come back,
and I shall be well again." At which he returned in a
hellish rage, and gave her four wounds more; when, even
in this condition, rising from her bed, she wrapped herself
in her night gown, and went to the Lord Bishop of Ra-
pho's chamber door (the Bishop lodging at that time in the
house) i( My Lord," said she, '« O'my Lord, make haste
unto me:" but as soon as his Lordihip came, me expired
in his arms, resigning her precious foul into the hands of
Almighty God. The cruel wretch her husband was shot
by the pursuers; too good a death for one who deserved
the gibbet: and the lady was universally lamented by all
tender and religious people. And this tragical relation I
have mentioned, upon the account of that impulse, or
dream, that the clergyman had at the fatal time of the
bloody action.
Some people make a very ill use of the general notion,
that there are no apparitions nor spirits at all: which is
worse than those who fancy they see them upon every oc-
casion; for those carry their notions farther, even to an-
nihilate the devil, and believe nothing about him, neither
of one kind or other: the next step they come to, is to
conclude, " There is no God," and so atheism takes its
rite in the fame fink, with a carelest'aess about futurity. But
there is no occasion to enter upon an argument to prove the
being of the Almighty, or to illustrate his power by words,
who has so many undeniable testimonies in the breasts of
every rational being to prove his existence: and we have
sufficient proofs enough to convince us of the great super-
intendency of Divine Providence in the minutest affairs of
this world; the manifest existence of the invisible world;
the reality of spirits, and intelligence between us and
them. What I have said, I hope, will not mislead any
person, or be a means whereby they may delude them-
selves; for 1 have spoken of these things with the utmost
seriousness of mind, and with a sincere and ardent desire
for the general good and beneiit of the world.
