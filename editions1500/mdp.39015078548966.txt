LIFE OF THE AUTHOR.
DANIEL DE _FOE was born in London about
the year 1663. His father was a butcher; and
the family name was Foe, until our author, for some
unknown reason, changed it to De Foe. He was
probably intended for trade; but very soon after
he had received such education as a school at
Newington-green afl"orded,,he became a political
writer. I-Ie afterwards -engaged in business as a.
hosier, and then as a pantile-maker; but in both
was unsuccessful. His head was frequently em-
ployed on projects, and he even wrote an essay on
that subject; but he was always either unskilful, or
unfortunate. It is, however, much to his credit
that he continued satisfying the demands of his
creditors, as he was able, until they were paid the
whole amount of their debts.
The rst of his performances which excited much
attention was ‘ The True-Born Englishman,’ pub-
lished in 1701. This was a poetical satire, in de-
fence of King William, who, at that time, was
blamed for employing foreigners as his friends at
court. During the popularity of this piece, he
wrotefanother satire, called ‘ Reformation of Man-
ners,’ in which, among other topics, appeared one of
the rst censures on the slave trade.
As De Foe was a wit, he often employed an iro-
nical way of writing which the age was too dull
to comprehend. In this style, he wrote a pamphlet,
entitled ‘ The Shortest Way with the Dissenters,
or Proposals for the Establishment of the Church.’
It was, in fact, a defence of the dissenters, but so
ill understood, that the House of Commons pro-
nounced it to be a seditious libel; and De Foe suf-
fered ne, imprisonment, and the pillory; the latter
of which punishments he bore with great fortitude,
and amused himself by writing ‘ A Hymn to the
Pillory,’ during his connement. In February,
1703-4:, while in Newgate, he commenced a periodi-
cal publication, called the ‘ Review,’ which has
been supposed, and not without some reason, to
have given rise to the Tatler and Spectator. At
length he was liberated, by the interposition of Mr.
Harley, afterwards Lord Oxford, and resumed his
occupation of political writing. Among his prin-
cipal productions of this kind, were ‘ J ure Divine,’
a poetical satire, in twelve books, against arbitrary
government; and‘The History of the Union,’ which
has lately been reprinted; to promote this, he was
sent to Scotland, where he wrote a poem, in honour
of the inhabitants of that country, called ‘ Caledo.
nia.’ He wrote also, ‘ The History of Addresses,’
and some pamphlets in favour of the house of Hano-
ver, which, being written in an ironical style, were
unfortunately mistaken for defences of the Pretend-
er, and the author was again prosecuted and im-
prisoned. These misfortunes induced him, about
the year 1715, to relinquish politics altogether, and
employ his pen on subjects of morals or manners.
His performances in this way were chiey ‘ The
Family Instructor,’ in dialogues, a work to which
Richardson in his novels owes great obligation. He
wrote also in the same form ‘ Religious Courtship,’
and the narratives of‘ Robinson Crusoe,’ ‘ The Life
of Captain Singleton,’ ‘ Colonel Jack,’ ‘ Moll Flan-
ders,’ ‘ Duncan Campbell,’ and ‘ The Fortunate
Mistress.’ The morality of some of these has been
justly questioned, but they have all the fascinations
of simplicity of style and probability of adventure,
and all enjoyed a considerable share of popularity.
In 1722, he wrote a ‘ Journal of the Plague in 1665,’
which, although a ction, imposed on Dr. Mead, who
considered it as a book of authority. IIe published
also three volumes of ‘ Travels through England
and Scotland,’ which have been the foundation of
all the complete tours and other publications of that
kind since. In this manner, for several years, he
continued to publish treatises, or pieces of ction,
many of which are no longer read; and his poetry,
it must be confessed, is only valuable as including
hints of the events and political characters of the
times.
He died at his house at Islington, in 1731, leaving
a daughter, who was married to Mr. H. Baker, the
ingenious naturalist.
Of all his writings, that which is now before the
reader has ever been the most popular. It was rst
published in 1719; and, perhaps, few years have
since passed without its being reprinted in some
convenient form. A story has long prevailed that
De Foe defrauded a Scotch seaman, of the name
of Selkirk, of his papers, or journals, and made
them the foundation of this novel. That such a
seaman existed, and was shipwrecked, and after-
wards wrote a journal, is probable enough; but
that he contributed more than the mere suggestion
of writing Robinson Crusoe, it is impossible to be-
lieve, nor have we any authenticated facts in favour
of the supposition. Robinson Crusoe, in all its
essential points, is a pure ction, and displays a
reach of invention which had never before appeared
in any English work of the kind; a fertility of
fancy and genius which De Foe could have bor-
rowed from no source but the inexhaustible fund
of his own mind. In adapting his style to the sup-
posed situation and rank of Crusoe, he is eminently
successful, simplicity and perspieuity being so uni-
formly preserved, that, perhaps, it is impossible to
/
name awork so fascinating to young and unenlighten-
ed minds, or so happily adapted to their comprehen-
sion. It has, for nearly a_eentury, been one of the
most popular books in our language, and translation
into most of the European languages has rendered
it the subject of admiration abroad. It has been
well observed, that it‘breathes throughout a spirit
of piety and benevolence, and sets in a very strik-
ing light the importance of the mechanic arts: it
xes in the mind a lively idea of the horrors of so-
litude, and, consequently, of the sweets of social
life, and of the blessings we derive from converse-
tion, and mutual aid.
I WAS born in the year 1632, in the city of York,
of a good family, though not of that country,
my father being a foreigner of Bremen, who settled
rst at I-Iull. He got a good estate by merchandise,
and leaving ofl’ his trade, lived afterwards at York ;
from whence he had married my mother, whose re-
lations were named Robinson, a very good family in
that country, and from whom I was called Robinson
Jfrcu6znac'r; but, by the usual corruption of words
in England,we are now called, nay, we call ourselves,
and write our name, Crusoe; and so my companions
always called me.
I had two elder brothers; one of whom was lieu-
tenant-colonel to an English regiment of foot in Flan-
ders, formerly commanded by the famous colonel
Lockhart, and was killed at the battle near Dunkirk
against the Spaniards. What became of my second
brother, I never knew, any more than my father or
mother did know what was become of me.
Being the third son of the family, and not bred to
any trade, my head began to be lled very early with
rambling thoughts. My father, who was very an-
cient, had given me a competent share of learning,
as far as house-education and a country free-school
generally goes, and designed me for the law; hut 1
would be satised with nothing but going to sea;
and my inclination to this led me so strongly against-
the will, nay, the commands of my father, and
against all the cntreaties and persuasions of my mo-
ther and other friends, that there seemed to be some-
thing fatal in that propension of nature, tending di-
rectly to the life of misery which was to befall me.

I
My father, a wise and grave man, gave me se-
rious and excellent counsel against what he fore-
saw was my design. I-Ie called me one morning into
his chamber, where he was conned by the gout, and
expostulated very warmly with me upon this subject.
I-Ie asked me what reasons, more than a mere wan-
dering inclination, I had for leaving my father's
house, and my native country; where I might be
well introduced, and had a prospect of raising my
fortune by application and industry, with a life of
ease and pleasure. Irle told me it was men of des-
perate fortunes on one hand, or of aspiring supe-
rior fortunes on the other, who went abroad upon
adventures, to rise by enterprise, and make them-
selves famous in undertakings of a nature out of the
common road; that these things were all either
‘too far above me, or too far below me; that mine
was the middle state, or what might be called the
-upper station of low life, which he had found, by
long experience, was the best state in the world ; the
most suited to human happiness, not exposed to the
miseries and hardships, the labour and sufferings, of
the mechanic part of mankind; and not embarrassed
with the pride, luxury, ambition, and envy of the
upper part of mankind. He told me, I might judge
of the happiness of this state by this one thing; viz.
that this was the state of life which all other people
envied; that kings have frequently lamented the mi-
serable consequences of being born to great things,
and wished they had been placed in the middle of
the two extremes, between the mean and the great;
that the wise man gave his testimony to this, as the
just standard of true felicity, when he prayed to have
neither poverty nor riches.
He bade me observe it, and I should always nd,
that the calamities of life were shared among the up-
per and lower part of mankind; but that the middle
station had the fewest dis-asters,and was not exposed
to so many vicissitudes as the higher or lower part
of mankind 3 nay, they were not subjected to so
many distempers and unea.sinesses,"ei~tlrer -of body or
mind, as those were, who, by vicious living, luxury,
and extravagancies on one hand, or by hard labour,
want of necessaries, and mean or insufcicnt diet,
on the other hand,bring distempers upon themselves
by the natural consequences of their way of living;
that the middle station of life was calculated for all
kind of virtues, and all kind of enjoyments; that
peace and plenty were the handmaids of a mid-
dle fortune; that temperance, moderation, quietness,
health, society, all agreeable diversions, and all de-
sirable pleasures, were the blessings attending the
middle station of life; that this way men went si-
lently and smoothly through the world, and comfort-
ably out of it; not embarrassed with the labours
of the hands, or of the head; not sold to a life
of slavery for daily bread, or harassed with perplex-
ed circumstances, which rob the soul of peace, and
the body of rest; nor enraged with the passion of
envy, or the secret burning lust of ambition for great
things; but in easy circumstances, sliding gently
through the world, and sensibly tasting the sweets
of living, without the bitter; feeling that they are
happy, and learning by every day‘s experience to
know it more sensibly. I
After this, he pressed me earnestly, and in the
most affectionate manner, not to play the young
man, nor to precipitate myself into miseries, which
nature, and the station of life I was born in, seemed
to have provided against; that I was under no ne-
cessity of seeking my bread; that he would do well
for me, and endeavour to enter me fairly into the
station of life which he had been just recommend-
ing to me; and that if I was not very easy and
happy in the world, it must be my mere fate, or
fault, that must hinder it; and that he should have
nothing to answer for, having thus discharged his
duty in warning me against measures which he knew
would be to my hurt. In a word, that as he would
do very kind things for me, if I would stay and settle
at home as he directed; so he would not have so
much hand in my misfortunes, as to give me any en-
couragement to go away: and to close all, he told
me, 1 had my elder brother for an example, to whom
he had used the same earnest persuasions to keep
him from going into the Low Country wars; but
could not prevail, his young desires prompting him
to run into the army, where he was killed; and
though he said he would not cease to pray for me,
yet he would vehture to say to me, that if'I did take
this foolish step, God would not bless me; and I
would have leisure hereafter to reect upon having
neglected his counsel, when there might be none to
assist in my recovery.
i I observed in this last part of his discourse, which
was truly prophetic, though I suppose my father did
not know it to be so himself; I say, I observed the
tears run down his face very plentifully, especially
when he spoke of my brother who was killed 2 and
that when he spoke of myhavingleisure to repent, and
none to assist me, he was so moved, that he broke off
the discourse, and told me, his heart was so full, he
could say no more to me.
I was sincerely affected with this discourse, as in-
deed who could be otherwise? And I resolved not
to think of going abroad any more, ‘but to settle at
home according to my father's desire. But, alas!
a few days wore it all off; and, in short, to prevent
any of my father’s farther importunities, in a few
weeks after I resolved to run quite away from him.
I-Io-wever, I did not act so hastily neither, as the rst
heat of my resolution prompted ; but I took my mo-
ther at a time when 1 thought her a little pleasanter
than ordinary, and told her, that my thoughts were
so entirely bent upon seeing the world, that I should
never settle to any thing with resolution enough to
go through with it; and my father had better give
me his consent, than force me to go without it:
that I was now eighteen years old, which was too
late to go apprentice to a trade, or clerk to an attor-
ney: that I was sure, if I did, I should never serve
out my time, but I should certainly run away from
my master before my time was out, and go to sea :
and if she would speak to my father to let me go one
voyage abroad, if I came home again, and did not
likeit, I would go no more, and I would promise, by
a double diligence, to recover the time I had lost.
This put my mother into a great passion. She told
me, she knew it would be to no purpose to speak to
my father upon any such subject; that he knew too
well what was my interest, to give his consent to any
thing so much for my hurt; and that she wondered
how I could think of any such thing, after the dis-
course I had had with my father, and such kind and
tender expressions, as she knew my father had used
to me; and that, in short, if I would ruin myself,
there was no hclp for me; but I might depend I
should never have their consent to it: that, for her
part, she would not have so much hand in my de-
struction ; and I should never have it to say, that my
mother was willing, when my father was not.
Though my mother refused to move it to my fa-
ther, yet I heard afterwards that she reported all the
discourse to him ; and that my father, after showing
a great concern at it, said to her, with a sigh, ‘ That
the boy might be happy, if he would stay at home;
but if he goes abroad, he will be the most miserable
wretch that ever was born: I can give no consent
to it.’
It was not till almost a year after thisthat I broke
loose, though in the mean time I continued obsti-
nately deaf to all proposals of settling to business,
and frequently expostulating with my father and
mother about their being so positively determined
against what they knew my inclinations prompted
me to. But being one day at I-Iull, whither I went
casually, and without any purpose of making an
elopement that time; but, I say, being there, and one
of my companions being going by sea to London, in
his father’s ship, and prompting me to go with them,
with the common allurement of a seafaring man,
that it should cost me nothing for my passage, I con-
sulted neither father nor mother any more, nor so
much as sent them word of it: but leaving them to
hear of it, as they might, without asking God’s bless-
ing, or my father’s, without any consideration of cir-
cumstances or consequences, and in an ill hour,God
knows, on the rst of September, 1651, I went on
board a ship bound for London. Never any young
adventurer’s misfortunes, I believe, began sooner or
continued longer, than mine. The ship was no
sooner got out of the llumber, but the wind began
to blow, and the sea to rise in a most frightful man-
ner ; and, as I had never been at sea before, I was
most inexpressibly sick in body, and terried in
mind. I began now seriously to reect upon what l;
had done, and how justly I was overtaken by the
judgement of heaven, for my wicked leaving my fa-
ther’s house, and abandoning my duty. All the
good counsel of my parents, my father's tears, and
my mother’s entreaties, came now fresh into my
mind; and my conscience, which was not yet come
to the pitch of hardness to which it has been since,
reproaehed me with the contempt of advice, and the
breach of my duty to God and my father.
All this while the storm increased, and the sea
went very high,though nothing like what I have seen
many times since; no, nor what I saw a few days
after. But it was enough to afcct me then, who was
but a young sailor, and had never known any thing
of the matter. 1 expected every wave would have
swallowed us up, and that every time the ship fell
down, as l thought it did, in the trough or hollow of
the sea, we should never rise more. In this agony
of mind, I made many vows and resolutions, that if
it would please God to spare my life in this one
voyage, if ever l got once my foot upon dry land
again, I would go directly home to my father, and
never set it into a ship again while I lived: that I
would take his advice, and never run myself into
such miseries as these any more. Now I saw plainly
the goodness of his observations about the middle
station of life, how easy, how comfortable, he had
lived all his days, and never had been exposed to
tempests at sea, or troubles on shore : and, in short,
I resolved that I would, like a true repenting prodi-
gal, go home to my father.
These wise and sober thoughts continued all the
while the storm continued, and indeed some time
after; but the next day the wind was abated, and the
sea calmer, and I began to be a little inurcd to it.
However, I was very grave for all that day, being
also a little sea-sick still; but towards night the
weather cleared up, the wind was quite over, and a
charming fme evening followed ; the sun went down
perfectly clear, and rose so the next morning; and
having little or no wind, and a smooth sea, the sun
shining upon it, the sight was, as l thought, the most
delightful that ever I saw.
I had slept well in the night, and was now no
more sea-sick, but very cheerful ; looking with won-
der upon the sea, that was so rough and terrible the
day before, and could be so calm and so pleasant in
so little a time after. And now, lest my good reso-
lutions should continue, my companion, who had in-
deed enticed me away, comes to me, ‘ Well, Bob,’
says he, clapping me upon the shoulder, ‘how do you
do after it? I warrant you were frighted, wa’n‘t you,
last night, when it blew but a capfull of wind?‘ ‘ A
capfull d’you call it ?’ said I, ‘ ’twas a terrible storm.’
‘ A storm, you fool you!‘ replies he: ‘ do you call
that a storm? Why it was nothing at all; give us
but a good ship and sea-room, and we think nothing
of such a squall of wind as that: hut, y0u‘re but a
fresh-water sailor, Bob. Come, let us make a bowl
of punch, and we'll forget all that. D’you see what
charming weather ’tis now?’ To make short this
sad part ofmy story, we went the way of all sailors;
the punch was made, and I was made half drunk
with it, and in that one night’s wickedness I drowned
all my repentance, all my reections upon my past
conduct, and all my resolutions for the future. In a
word, as the sea was returned to its smoothness of
surface, and settled calmness, bythe abatement of
that storm, so the hurry of my thoughts being over,
my fears and apprehensions of being swallowed up
by sea being forgotten, and the current of my for-
mer desires returned, I entirely forgot the vows
and promises that I made in my distress. ,I found
indeed some intervals of reection, and the serious
thoughts did. as it were, endeavour to return again
sometimes; but I shook them off, and roused myself
from them, as it were from a distemper; and apply-
ing myself to drinking and company, soon mastered
the return of those fits (for so I called them); and I
had, in live or six days, got as complete a victory
over conscience, as any young fellow that resolved
not.to be troubled with it could desire. But I was
to have another trial for it still ; and Providence, as
in such cases generally it does, resolved to leave me
entirely without excuse: for, if I would not take
this for a deliverance, the next was to be such pa one,
as the worst and most hardened wretch among us
would confess both the danger and the mercy.
The sixth day of our being at sea, we came into
Yarmouth Roads: the wind having been contrary,
and the weather calm, we had made but little way
since the storm. Here we were obliged to come to
an'anchor; and here we lay, the wind continuing
contrary, viz. at south-west, for seven or eight days :
during which time a great many ships from New-
castle came into the same roads, as the common har-
bour where the ships might wait for a wind for the
river. ~
We had not, however, rid here so long, but we
should have tidad-it up the river, but that the wind
blew too fresh ; and, after we had lain four or ve
days, blew very hard. I-Iowever, the roads being
reckoned as good as a harbour, the anchorage
good, and our ground-tackle very strong, our men
were unconcerned, and not in the least apprehensive
of danger, but spent the time in rest and mirth, after
the manner of the sea: but the eighth day in the
morning, the wind increased, and we had all hands
at work to strike our top-masts, and make every
thing snug and close, that the ship might ride as
easy as possible. By noon, the sea went very high
indeed, and our ship rid fore-castle in, shipped se-
veral seas, and we thought once or twice our anchor
had come home; upon which our master ordered out
the sheet-anchor, so thatwe rode with two anchors
ahead, and the cables veered out to the better end.
By this time it blew a terrible storm indeed; and
nowl began to see terror and amazement in the faces
even of the seamen themselves. The master, though
vigilant in the business of preserving the ship, yet, as
he went in and out of his’ cabin by me, I could hear
him, softly to himself, say several times; ‘ Lord be
merciful to us! -We shall be all lost; we shall be all
undone!’ and the like. During these rst hurries I
was stupid, lying still in my cabin, which was in the
stecrage, and cannot describe my temper. I could
ill resume the rst penitence, which 1 had so appa-
rently trampled upon, and hardened myself against.
I, thought the bitterness of death had been past ; and
that this would be nothing too, like the rst. But
when the master himself came by me, as I said just
now, and said we should be all lost, I was dreadfully
frighted. I got up out of my cabin, and looked out;
but such a dismal sight I never saw; the sea went
mountains high, and broke upon us every three or
four minutes. When I could look about, I could see
nothing but distress round us. Two ships that rid
near us, we found had cut their masts by the board,
being deep loaden; and our men cried out, that a
ship, which rid about a mile ahead of us, was foun-
dered. Two more ships, being driven from their an-
chors, were run out of the roads to sea, at all ad-
ventures, and that not with a mast standing. The
light ships fared the best, as not so much labouring
B2
in the sea; but two or three of them drove, and came
close by us, running away, with only their sprit-sail
out, before the wind. ‘ .
Towards the evening, the mate and boatswain
begged the master of our ship to let them cut away
the fore-mast, which he was very unwilling to do;
but the boatswain protesting to him, that if he did
not, the ship would founder, he consented: and
when they had out away the fore-mast, the main-
mast stood so loose, and shook the ship so much,
they were obliged to cut her away also, and make a
clear deck.
Any one may judge what a condition I must be
in at all this, who was but a young sailor, and who
had been in such a fright before at but a little. But,
if I can express at this distance the thoughts I had
about me at that time, I was in tenfold more horror
of mind upon account of my'former convictions,
and the having returned from them to the resolu-
tions I had wickedly taken at rst, than I was at
death itself; and these, added to the terror of the
storm, put me into such a condition, that I can by
no words describe it. But the worst was -not come
yet: the storm continued with such fury, that the
seamen themselves acknowledged they had never
seen a worse. We had a good ship, but she was
deep loaden, and wallowed in the sea, that the sea.
men every now and then cried out, she would
founder. It was my advantage in one respect, that
I did not know what they meant by founder, till I
inquired. However, the storm was so violent, that
I saw what is not often seen, the master, the ‘boat-
swain, and some others more sensible than the rest,
at their prayers, and expecting every moment when
the ship would go to the bottom. In the middle of
the night, and under all the rest of our distresses,
one of the men that had been down on purpose to
see, cried out we had sprung a leak ; another said,
there was four feet water" in the hold. Then all
hands were called to the pump. At that very word
\
my heart, as I thought, died within me; and I fell
backwards upon the side of the bed where I sat,
into the cabin. Ilowever, the men roused me, and
told me, that I that was able to do nothing before,
was as well able to pump as another: at which I
stirred up, and went to the pump, and worked very
heartily. While this was doing, the master, seeing
some light collicrs, who, not able to ride out the
storm, were obliged to slip and run away to sea,
and would come near us, ordered to re a gun
as a signal of distress. I, who knew nothing what
that meant, was so surprised, that I thought the ship
had broke, or some dreadful thing happened. In a
word, I was so surprised, that I fell down in a
swoon. As this was a time when every body had
his 0\vn life to think of, nobody minded me, or what
was become of me: but another man stepped up to
the pump, and, thrusting me aside with his foot, let
me lie, thinking I had been dead; and it was a
great while before I came to myself.
We worked on, but the water increasing in the
hold, it was a.pparent that the ship would founder;
and though the storm began to abate a little, yet
as it was not possible she could swim till we might
run into any port, so the master continued ring
guns for help; and a light ship, who had rid it out
just ahead of us, ventured a boat out to help us.
It was with the utmost hazard the boat came near
us; but it was impossible for us to get on board, or
for the boat to lie near the ship-side, till at last the
men rowing very heartily, and venturing their lives
to save ours, our men east them a rope over the
stern with a buoy to it, and then veered it out a
great length, which they, after much labour and
hazard, took hold of; and we hauled them close
under our stern, and got all into their boat. It was
to no purpose for them or us, after we were in the
boat, to think of reaching to their own ship; so all
agreed to let her drive, and only to pull her in to-
wards shore as much as we could; and our -master
promised them, that if the boat was starved upon
shore, he would make it good to their master. So
partly rowing, and partly driving, our boat went
away to the northward, sloping towards the shore,
almost as far as Wintertonness.
We were not much more than a quarter of an hour
out of our ship, but we saw her sink: and then I
understood, for the rst time, what was meant by a
ship foundering in'the sea. I must acknowledge I
had hardly eyes to look up, when the seamen told
me she was sinking; for, from that moment, they
rather put me into the boat, than that l might be
said to go in; my heart was, as it were, dead within
me, partly with fright, partly with horror of mind,
and the thoughts of what was yet before me.
VVhile we were in this condition, the men yet la-
bouring at the oar to bring the boat near the shore,
we could see (when our boat mounting the waves,
we were able to see the shore) a great many people
running along the strand to assist us when we should
come near. But we made but slow way towards the
shore; nor were we able to reach the shore, till, being
past the light-house at Winterton, the shore falls of?
to the westward towards Cromer; and so the land
broke off a little the violence of the wind. Here we
got in ; and, though not without much difculty, got
all safe on shore; and walked afterwards on foot to
Yarmouth, where, as unfortunate men, we were used
with greathumanity, as well by the magistrates of
the town, who assigned us good quarters, as by par-
ticular merchants and owners of ships; and had
money given us suieient to carry us either to Lon-
don, or back to I-lull, as we thought t.
I-Iad I now had the sense to have gone back to
Irlull, and have gone home, l had been happy, and
my father, an emblem of our blessed Saviour’s para-
ble, had even killed the fatted calf for me; for,
hearing the ship I went away in was castaway in
Yarmouth roads, it was a great while before he had
any assurances that I was not drowned.
But my ill fate pushed me on now with an obsti-
nacy that nothing could resist; and though I had
several times loud calls from my reason, and my
more composed judgement, to go homo, yet I had no
power to do it. I know not what to call this; nor
will I urge, that it is a secret over-ruling decree,
that hurries us on to be the instruments of our own
destruction, even though it be before us, and that
we push upon it with our eyes open. Certainly,
nothing but some such decreed unavoidable misery
attending, and which it was impossible for me to
escape, could have pushed me forward against the
calm reasonings and persuasions of my most retired
thoughts, and against two such visible instructions
as I had met with in my rst attempt.
My comrade, who had helped to harden me before,
and who was the 1naster’s son, was now less forward
than I. The rst time he spoke to me after we were
at Yarmouth, which was not till two or three days,
for we were separated in the town to several quar-
ters; I say, the rst time he saw me, it appeared
his tone was altered; and, looking very melancholy,
and shaking his head, asked me how I did: and
telling his father who I was, and how I had come
this voyage only for a trial, in order to go farther
abroad ; his father turning to me with a very grave
and concerned tone, ‘ Young man,’ says he, ‘ you
ought never to go to sea any more; you ought to
take this for a plain and visible token, that you are
not to be a seafaring man.’ ‘ Why, sir,’ said I, ‘ will
you go to sea no more i’ ‘ That is another case,’ said
he; ‘ it is my calling, and therefore my duty; but,
as you made this voyage for a trial, you see what a
taste Heaven has given you of what you are to
expect, if you persist: perhaps all this has befallen
us on your account, like Jonah in the ship of Tar-
shish. Pray,‘ continues he, ‘ what are you? and on
what account did you go to sea ?’ Upon that l told
him some of my story; at the end of which he burst
out with a strange kind of passion. ‘ What had l
done) says he, ‘ that such an unhappy wretch should
come into my ship? I would not set my foot in the
same ship with thee again for a thousand pounds!’
This indeed was, as I said, an excursion of his spirits,
which were yet agitated by the sense of his loss, and
was further than he could have authority to go.
I-Iowever, he afterwards talked very gravely to me,
exhorting me to go back to my father, and not tempt
Providence to my ruin; told me I might see a visible
hand of Heaven against me: ‘ And, young man,’ said
he, ‘ depend upon it, if you do not go back, wherever
you go, you will meet with nothing but disasters and
disappointments, till your father‘s words are fullled
upon you.‘
We parted soon after; for I made him little an-
swer, and I saw him no more : which way he went,
I know not. As for me, having some money in ‘my
pocket, I travelled to London by land; and there,
as well as on the road, had many struggles with my-
self. what course of life I should take, and whether
I should go home, or go to sea.
As to going home, shame opposed the best motions
that offered to my tllouglits; and it immediately oc-
curred to me how I should be laughed at among the
neighbours, and should be ashamed to see, not my
father and mother only, but even every body else.
From whencel have since often observed how incon-
gruous and irrational the common temper of man-
kind is, especially of youth, to that reason that
ought toguide them in such cases; viz. that they
are not ashamed to sin, and yet are ashamed to
repent; not ashamed of the action, for which they
oughtjustly to be esteemed fools ; but are ashamed
of the returning, which only can make them es-
teemed wise men.
In this state of life, however, I remained some
time, uncertain what measures to take, and what
course of life to lead. An irresistible reluctance
continued to going home ; and, as I stayed awhile,
the remembrance of the distress I had been in wore
off : and as that abated, the little motion I had in
my desires to a return, wore off with it, till at last
I quite laid aside -the thoughts of it, and looked out
for a voyage. "
That evil inuence which carried me rst away
from my father‘s house, which hurried me into the
wild and indigested notion of raising my fortune,
and that impressed those conceits so forcibly upon
me, as to make me deaf -to all good advice, and to
the entreaties, and even the commands, of my father:
I say, the same inuence, whatever it was, presented
the most unfortunate of all enterprises to my view‘;
and I went on board a vessel bound to the coast of
Africa, or, as our sailors vulgarly call it, a voyage to
Guinea.
It was my great misfortune, that, in all these ad-
ventures, I did not ship myself as a sailor; whereby,
though I might indeed have worked a little harder
than ordinary, yet at the same time I had learned
the duty and office of a fore-mastman ; and in time
might have qualified myself for a mate or lieutenant,
if not for a master. But as it was always my fate
to choose for the worse, so I did here ; for, having
money~in my pocket, and good clothes on my back,
I would always go on board in the habit of a gentle-
man : and so I neither had any business in the ship,
nor learned to do any. .
It was my lot rst of all to fall into pretty good
company in London, which does not always happen
to such loose and unguided young fellows as I then
was; the devil, generally, not omitting to lay some
snare for them very early: but it was not so with
me. I rst fell acquainted with the master of a
ship who had been on thecoast of Guinea, and who,
having had'very good success there, was resolved
to go again. This captain, taking a fancy to my
conversation, which was not disagreeable at that
time, hearing me say I had a mind to see the world,
told me, if I would go the voyage with him, I should
be at no expense; I should be his messmate, and his
companion; andtif. I" could carry any thing with me,
I should. have alI'tl1o,, advantage. of it that the trade
would admit; and. perhaps I might meet with some
encouragement.
I embraced the offer, and, entering into a strict
friendship with this captain, who was an honest
plain--dealing man, went the voyage with him ; and
carried a small adventure with me, which, by the
disinterested honesty of my friend the captain, I
increased very considerably ; for I carried about 40!.
in such toys and trilies as the captain directed me
to buy. This 401. I had mustered together by the
assistance of some.of my relations whom I corre-
spondcd with, and who, 1 believe, got my father, or
at least my mother, to contribute so much as that
to my rst adventure. y
This was the only voyage which I may say was
successful in all my adventures, and which I owe to
the integrity and honesty of my friend the captain;
under whom I also got a competent knowledge of the
mathematics, and the rules of navigation; learned
how to keep an account of the ship’s course, take an
observation, and, in short, to understand some things
that were needful to be understood by a sailor: for,
as he took delight to introduce me, I took delight to
learn; and, in a word, this voyage made me both a
sailor and a merchant: for 1 brought home ve
pounds nine ounces of gold-dust for my adventure,
which yielded me in London, at my return, almost
3001.; and this lled me with those aspiring thoughts
which have since so completed my ruin.
i Yet, even in this vcyage,Ihadmy misfortunes too;
particularly that Iwas continually sick, being thrown
into a violent calenture by the excessive heat of the
climate, our principal trading being upon the coast,
from the latitude of 15 degrees N. even to the line
itself.
I was now set up for a Guinea trader; and my
friend, to my great misfortune, dying soon after his
arrival, I resolved to go the same voyage again: and
I embarked in the same vessel with onewho was his
mate in the fonner voyage, and had now got the
command of the ship. This was the unhappiest
voyage that ever man made; for though I did not
carry quite 100$. of my new-gained wealth, so that
I had QOOZ. left, and which I lodged with my friend’s
widow, who was very just to me, yet I fell into
terrible misfortunes in this voyage: and the rst
was this; viz. our ship, making her course towards
the Canary islands, or rather between those islands
and the African shore, was surprised in the gray of
the morning by a Moorish rover of Sallee, who gave
chase to us with all the sail she could make. We
crowded also as much canvass as our yards would
spread, or our masts carry, to have got clear; but,
finding the pirate gained upon us, and would cer-
tainly come up with us in a few hours, we prepared
to ght; our ship having twelve guns, and the
rogue eighteen. About three in the afternoon he
came up with us, and bringing to, by mistake, just
athwart our quarter, instead of athwart our stern, as
he intended, we brought eight of our guns to bear
on that side, and poured in a broadside upon him,
which made him sheer off again, after returning our
re, and pouring in also his small shot from near two
hundred men which he had on board. However, we
had not a man touched, all our men keeping close.
I-Ie prepared to attack us again, and we to defend
ourselves; but, laying us on board the next time
upon our other quarter, he entered ninety inen upon
our decks,who immediately fell to cutting and hack-
ing the decks and rigging. We plied them with small
shot, half-pikes, powder-chests, and such like, and
cleared our decks of them twice. However, to cut
short this melancholy part of our story, our ship
being disabled, and three of our men killed, and
eight wounded, we were obliged to yield ; and were
carried all prisoners into Sallee, a port belonging to
the Moors.
The usage I had there was not so dreadful as at
rst I apprehended; nor was I carried up the coun-
try, to the emperor’s court, as the rest of our men
were, but was kept by the captain of the rover as his
proper prize, and made his slave, being young and
nimble, and t for his business. At this surprising
change of my circumstances, from a merchant to a
miserable slave, I was perfectly overwhelmed; and
now I looked back upon my fathcr’s prophetic dis-
course to me, that I should be miserable, and have
none to relieve me, which I thought was now so
effectually brought to pass, that I could not be
worse ; that now the hand of Heaven had overtaken
me, and I was undone without redemption. But,
alas! this was but a taste of the misery I was to
go through, as will appear in the sequel of this
story. '
As my new patron or master had taken me home
to his house, so I was in hopes that he would take
me with him when he went to sea again, believing
that it would be some time or other his fate to be
taken by a Spanish or Portugal man of war; and
that then I should be set at liberty. But this hope
of mine was soon taken away, for when he went to
sea, he left me on shore to look after his little gar-
den, and do the common drudgery of slaves about
his house; and when he came home again from his
cruise, he ordered me to lie in the cabin, to look
after the ship.
Here I meditated nothing but my escape, and
what method I might take to effect it; but found no
way that had the least probability in it. Nothing
presented to make the supposition of it rational, for
I had nobody to communicate it to that would em-
bark with me, no fellow slave, no Englishman, Irish-
man, or Scotsman there, but myself; so that for
two years, though I often pleased myself with the
imagination, yet I never had the least encouraging
prospect of putting it in practice. 4
After about two years, an odd circumstance pre-
sented itself, which put the old thought of making
some attempt for my liberty again in my head. My
patron lying at home longer than usual, without t-
ting out his ship, which, as I heard, was for want of
money, he used, constantly once or twice a week,
sometimes oftener, if the weather was fair, to take
the ship’s pinnace, and go outinto the road a shing;
and as he always took me and a young Maresco with
him to row the boat, we made him very merry, and
I proved very dexterous in catching sh; inasmuch
that sometimes he would send me with a Moor, one
of his kinsmen, and the youth the Maresco, as they
called him, to catch a dish of sh for him.
It happened one time, that going a shing with
him in a calm morning, a fog rose so thick, that
though we were not half a league from the shore, we
lost sight of it; and, rowing we knew not whither, or
which way, we laboured all day, and all the next
night; and when the morning came, we found we
had pulled off to sea, instead of pulling in for the
shore, and that we were at least two leagues from
the land. However, we got well in again, though
with a great deal of labour, and some danger; for
the wind began to blow pretty fresh in the morning:
but particularly we were all very hungry. ‘
But our patron, warned by this disaster, resolved
to take more care of himself for the future; and, hav-
ing lying by him the long-boat of our English ship
which he had taken, he resolved he would not go a
shing any more without a compass, and some pro-
vision: so he ordered the carpenter of his ship, who
was also an English slave, to build a little state-room
or cabin in the middle of the long-boat, like that of
a barge, with a placeto stand behind it to steer, and
haul home the main-sheet; and room before for a
hand or two to stand and work the sails, She sailed
with what we call a shoulder-of-inutton-sail ; and the
boomjibbed over the top of the cabin,which lay very
snug and low, and had in it room for him to lie, with
a slave or two, and a table to eat on, with some small
lockers to put in some bottles of such liquor as he
thought t to drink; particularly his bread, rice, and
coffee.
We were frequently out with this boat a shing;
and as. I was most dexterous to catch sh for him,
he never went without me. It happened one day,
that he had appointed to go out in this boat, either
for pleasure or for sh, with two or three Moors of
some distinction, and for whom he had provided ex-
traordinarily, and had therefore sent on board the
boat over night a larger store of provisions than
usual; and had ordered me to get ready three fusils
with powder and shot, which were on board his ship;
for that they designed some sport of fowliug as well
as shing. » ‘ V
I got all things ready, as he had directed; and
waited the next morning with the boat washed clean,
her ancient and pendants out, and every thing to
accommodate his guests; when, by and by, my pa-
tron came on board alone, and told me his guests
had put off going, upon some business that fell out,
and ordered me, with the manand boy, as usual, to
go out with the boat, and catch them some sh, for
that his friends were to sup at his house. I-Ie com~
manded me too, that as soon as I had got some sh,
I should bring it home to his house. -All which I
prepared to do.
This moment my former, notions of deliverance
darted into my thoughts, For now I found I was like
to have a little ship at my command; and my master
being gone, I prepared to furnish myself, not for sh~
ing business, but for a voyage: though I knew not,
neither did I so much as consider, whither I would
steer; for any where to get out of that place was
my way.
My rst contrivance was to make a pretence to
speak to this Moor, to get something for our subsist-
ence on board; for I told him we must not presume
to eat of our patron’s bread. He said, that was true;
so he brought a large basket of rusk or biscuit, of
their kind, and three jars with fresh water, into the
boat. I knew where my patron's case of bottles
stood, which, it was evident by the make, were taken
out of some English prize, and I conveyed them into
the boat, while the Moor was on shore, as if they
had been there before for our master. I conveyed
also a great lump of bees-wax into the boat, which
weighed about half a hundred weight, with a par-
cel of twine or thread, a hatchet, a saw, and a
hammer, all which were of great use to us after-
wards: especially the wax to make candles. Ano-
ther trick I tried upon him, which he innocently
came into also. I-Iis name was Ismael, whom they
call Muley, or Moley; so I called to him, ‘ Moley,’
said I, ‘ our patr0n’s guns are all on board the boat :
can you not get a little powder and shot? It may
be we may kill some alcamies (a fowl like our cur-
lieus) for ourselves; for I know he keeps the gunner’s
stores in the ship.’ ‘ Yes,’ says he, ‘ I'll bring some.’
Accordingly he brought a great leather pouch, which
held about a pound and a half of powder, or rather
more; and another with shot, that had ve or six
pounds, with some bullets, and put all into the boat.
At the same time I had found some powder of my
master's in the great cabin, with which I lled one
of the large bottles in the case, which was almost
empty, pouring what was in it into another: and thus
furnished with every thing needful, we sailed out of
the port to sh. The castle, which is at the entrance
ofthe port, knew who we were, and took no notice
of us ; and we were not above a mile out of the port,
before we hauled in our sail, and sat us down to sh.
The wind blew from the N. N. E. which was con-
trary to my desire; for had it blown southerly, I had
been sure to have made the coast of Spain, andpat
least reached to the bay of Cadiz; but my resolu-
tions were, blow which way it would, I would be
gone from that horrid place where I was, and leave
the rest to fate. A
After we had shed some time, and catched nothing
(for when I had sh on my hook, I would not pull
them up, that he might not see them), I said to the
Moor, ‘This will not do: our master will not be
thus served. We must stand farther off.’ He, think-
ing no harm, agreed; and being in the head of the
boat, set the sails, and, as I had the helm, I run the
boat out near a league farther, and then brought her
to, as if I would sh; when, giving the boy the helm,
I stepped forward to where the Moor was, and making
as if I stooped for something behind him, I took him
by surprise with my arm under his twist, and tossed
him clear overboard into the sea. I-Ie rose immedi-
ately, for he swam like a cork, and called to me,
begged to be taken in, told me he would go all over
the world with me. He swam so strong after the
boat, that he would have reached me very quickly,
there being but little wind; upon which I stepped
into the cabin, and, fetching one of the fowling-
pieces, I presented it at him, and told him I had
done him no hurt, and, if he would be quiet, I would
do him none: ‘ But,’ said I, ‘ you swim well enough
to reach the shore, and the sea is calm, make the best
of your way to shore, and I will do you no harm;
but, if you come near the boat, I’ll shoot you through
the head, for I am resolved to have my liberty.’ So
he turned himself about, and swam for the shore, and
I make no doubt but he reached it with ease, for he
was an excellent swimmer.
I could have been content to have taken this Moor
with me, and have drowned the boy, but there was
no venturing to trust him. When he was gone, I
turned to the boy, whom they called Xury, and said
to him, ‘ Xury, if you will be faithful to me, I’ll make
you a great man; but if you will not stroke your
face to be true to me, that is, swear by Mahomet,
and his father-’s beard, I must throw you into the sea
too.’ The boy_ smiled in my face, and spoke so in-
nocently, that I could not mistrust him ; and swore
to be faithful to me, and go all over the world with
me.
While I was in view of the Moor that was swim-
ming, I stood out directly to sea with the boat, rather
stretching to windward, that they might think me
gone towards the Strait’s mouth (as indeed any one
that had been in their wits must have been sup-
posed to do); for who would have supposed we were
sailed on to the southward, to the truly Barbarian
coast, where whole nations of Negroes were sure to
surround us with their canoes, and destroy us; where
we could never once go on shore, but we should be
devoured by savage beasts, or more merciless savages
of human kind?
But, as soon as it grew dusk inthe evening, I
changed my course, and steered directly south and
by cast, bending my course a little towards the east,
that I might keep in with the shore; and, having a
fair fresh gale of wind, and a smooth quiet sea, I
made such sail, that, I believe, by the next day at
three o’cloek in the afternoon, when I rst made the
land, I could not be less than 150 miles south of Sal-
lee, quite beyond the Emperor of Morocco’s domi-
nions, or indeed of any other king thereabouts, for
we saw no people.
Yet such was the fright I had taken at the Moors,
and the dreadful apprehensions I had of falling into
their hands, that I would not stop, or go on shore, or
come to an anchor, the wind continuing fair, till I
had sailed in that manner ve days; and then the
wind shifting to the southward, I concluded also,
that if any of our vessels were in chase of me, they
also would now give over ; so I ventured to make to
the coast, and came to an anchor in the mouth of a
little river, I knew not what or where, neither what
latitude, what country, what nation, or what river.
I neither saw or desired to see any people: the prin-
cipal thing I wanted was fresh water. We came into
this creek in the evening, resolving to swim on shore
as soon as it was dark, and discover the country; but
as soon as it was quite dark, we heard such dreadful
noises of the barking, roaring, and howling of wild
creatures, of we knew not what kinds, that the poor
boy was ready to die with fear, and begged of me not
to go on shore till day. ‘ Well, Xury,‘ said I, ‘ then
I won’t; but it may be we may see men’ by day, who
will be as bad to us as those lions.’ ‘ Then we may
give them the shoot gun,’ says Xury, laughing, ‘make
them run wey.’ Such English Xury spoke, by con-
versing among us slaves. However, I was glad’ to
see the boy so cheerful, and I gave him a dram (out
of our patron's case of bottles) to cheer him up.
After all, Xury's advice was good, and I took it: we
dropped our little anchor, and lay still all night; I
say still, for we slept none; for in two or three hours
we saw vast great creatures, we knew not what to
call them, of many sorts, come down to the sea-
shore, and run into the water, wallowing and wash-
ing themselves for the pleasure of cooling them-
selves: and they made such hideous howlings and
yellings, that I never indeed heard the like.
- Xury was dreadfully frighted, and indeed so was I
too ; but we were both worse frighted when we heard
one of the mighty creatures c_ome swimming towards
our boat: we could not see him, but we might hear
him by his blowing to be a monstrous huge and fu-
rious beast. Xury said it was a lion, and that it
might be for aught I know. Poor Xury cried out to
me to. weigh the anchor, and row.away. ‘ No,‘ says I,
‘ Xury,we can slip our cable with a buoy to it, and go
to sea; they cannot follow usfar.’ I had no sooner
said so, but I perceived the creature (whatever it
was) within two oars length, which something sur-
prised me ; however, I immediately stepped to the
cabin-door, and taking up my gun, red at him, upon
which he immediately tur-ned about, a-nd swam to-
wards the shore again. ' '
But it was not possible to describe the horrible
noises, and hideous cries and howlings that were
raised, as well upon the edge of the shore as higher
within the country, upon the noise or report-of a
gun, a thing, I have some reason to believe, those
creatures had never heard before. This convinced
me that there was no going on shore for us in the
night upon that coast, and how to venture on shore
in the day, was another question too; for, to have
fallen into the hands of any of the savages, had been
as bad as to have fallen into the paws of lions and
tigers ; at least we were equally apprehensive of the
danger of it.
Be that as it would, we were obliged to go on
shore somewhere or other for water, for we had not
a pint left in the boat: when or where to get to it,
was the point. Xury said if 1 would let him go on
shore with one of the jars, he would nd if there
was any water, and bring some to me. I asked him
why he would go, why I should not go, and he stay
in the boat. The boy answered with so much affec-
tion that made me love him ever after. Says he, ‘ If
wild mans come, they eat me; you go wey.’ ‘ Well,
Xury,’ said I, ‘ we will both go; and if the wild
mans come, we will kill them: they shall eat nei-
ther of us.’ So I gave Xury a piece of rusk-bread
to eat, and a dram out of our patron's case of bot-
tles, which I mentioned before, and we hauled the
boat in as near the shore as we thought was proper,
and waded on shore, carrying nothing but our arms,
and two jars for water.
I did not care to go out of sight of the boat,
fearing the coming of canoes with savages down
the river: but the boy seeing a low place, about
a mile up the country, rambled to it, and by and
by I saw him come running towards inc. I thought
he was pursued by some savage, or frighted with
some wild beast, and I ran forward towards him
to help him; but when I came nearer to him,
I saw something hanging over his shoulders, which
was a creaturethat he had shot, like a hare, but
dierent in colour, andglonger legs. I-Iowever, we
were very glad of it, and it was very good meat;
but the great joy that poor Xury came with, was
to tell me he had found good water, and seen no
wild mans. '
But we found afterwards that we need not take
such pains for water, _for a little higher up the creek
whore we were, we found the water fresh when the
tide was out, which ows but a little way up : so we
lled ourjars, and feasted on the hare we’ had killed,
and prepared to'g0 on our way, having seen no foot~
steps of any human creature in that part of the
country. ‘ ’ l
As I had been one voyage to this coast before, I
knew very well that the islands of‘ the Canaries, and
the Cape de Verd islands‘ also, lay not far off from
the coast. But as I had no instruments to take an
observation to l<'n"ow what latitude we were in, and
did not exactly know, or at least not remember, what
latitude they were in, I knew not where to look for
them, or when to stand off to sea towards them,
otherwise I might -now easily have found some of
these islands. But my hope was, that if I stood
along this coast till T came‘ to that part, where the
English traded, I should find some of their vessels
upon their usual design of trade, that would relieve
and take usin.
By the best of my calculation, that place where I
now was must be that cduntry which, lying between
the emperor of Morocc-o’s dominions and the Ne-
groes, lies waste and uninhabited, except by wild
beasts, the Negroes having abandoned it, and gone
farther south, for fear of the Moors ,‘ and the Moors
not thinking it worth inhabiting, by reason of its
barrenness, and indeed both forsaking it because of
the prodigious numbers of tigers, lions, leopards, and
other furious creatures which harbour there, so that
the Moors use it for their hunting only, where they
go like-an armyi two or three thousand men at a time;
and indeed for near a hundred miles together upon
this coast," we saw nothing but a waste uninhabited
country by day, and heard nothing but howlings and
roarings of wild beasts by night.
“Once or twice in the day-time, I thought I saw
the Pico of Teneriffe, being the high top of the
niountain T eneritfe in the Canaries, and had a great
mind to venture out in hopes 0f"1'C‘<LClllI‘lg thither;
but, having tried twice, I was forced in again by
contrary winds, the sea also going too high for my
little vessel; so I resolved to pursue my rst design,
and keep along the shore. i '
’ Several times we were obliged to land for fresh
water, after we had left this place ; and once in par-
ticular, being early in the morning, we came to an
anchor under a little point of land, which was pretty
high, and the tide beginning to flow, we lay still to
go farther in. Xury, whose eyes were more about
him than, it seems,mine were, calls softly to me, and
tells me that we had best go farther off the shore,
‘ For,’ says he, ‘look, yonderlies a dreadful monster
on the side of that hillock, fast asleep.’ I looked
where he pointed, and saw a dreadful monster in-
deed; for‘ it was a terrible great lion, that lay on
the side of the shore, under the shade of a piece of
the hill, that hung as it were a little over him.
‘Xury,’ said I, ‘ you shall go on shore, and kill him.’
Xury looked frighted, and said, ‘ Me kill! He eat
me at one mouth!’ one mouthful he meant. How-
ever, Isaid no more to the boy, but bade him be
still, and tookour biggest gun, which was almost
musket-bore, and loaded it with a good charge of
powder, and with two slugs, and laid it down ;; then
I loaded another gun with two bullets, and the third
(for we had three pieces) I loaded witlfve smaller
bullets. I took the best aim I could with the rst
piece, to have shot him into the head ; but he lay so
withhis leg raised a little above his nose, that the
slug hit his leg about the knee, and broke the bone.
He started up growling at rst, but nding his leg
broke, fell down again, and then got upon three
legs, and gave the most hideous roar that ever I
heard. I was a little surprised that I had not hit
him on the head: however, I took up the second
piece immediately; and, though he began to move.
off, red again, and shot him into the head, and had
the pleasure to see him drop, and making but little
noise, he lay struggling for life. Then Xury took
heart, and would have me let him go on shore.
‘ Well, go,’ said I. So the boy jumped into the
water, and taking a little gun in one hand, swam
to shore wi-th the other hand, and coming close
to the creature, put the muzzle of the piece to his
ear, and shot him into the head again, which dis-
patched him quite.
This was game indeed to us, but this was no food;
and I was very sorry to lose three charges of pow-
dor and shot upon a creature that was good for no-
thing to us. However, Xury said he would have
some of him: so he comes on board, and asked me
to give him the hatchet. ‘ For what, Xury ?’ said I.
‘ Me cut off his head,’ said he. However, Xury
could not cut off his head, but he cut elf a foot, and
brought it with him, and it was a monstrous great
one. 1 ~
I bethought myself, however, that perhaps the
skin of him might one way or other be of some value
to us ; and I resolved to take off his skin if I could.
So Xury and I went to work with him, but Xury
was much the better workman at it, for I knew very
Ill how to do it. Indeed it took us up both the
whole day; but at last we got off the hide of him,
and, spreading it on the top of our cabin, the sun
effectually dried it in two days time, and it after-
wards scrved me to lie upon.
After this stop, we made on to the southward con-
tinually, for ten or twelve days, living very sparingly
on our provisions, which began to abate very much,
and going no oftener in to the shore than we were
obliged to, for fresh water. My design in this was
to make the river Gambia or Sene-gall, that is to say,
any where about the Cape de Verd, whereI was in
hopes to meet with some European ship; and if I did
not, Iwknew not what course I had to take, but to
seek for the islands, or perish there among the Ne-
groes. I knew that all the ships from Europe, which
sailed either to the coast of Guinea, or to Brasil, or
to the East Indies, made this cape or those islands,
and, in a word, I put the whole of my fortune upon
this single point, either that I must meet with some
ship, or must perish.
' When I had pursued this resolution about ten days
longer, as I have said, I began to see that the land
was inhabited; and in two or three places, as we
sailed by, we saw people stand upon the shore to
look at us: we could also perceive they were quite
black, and stark naked. I was onceinclined to have
gone on shore to them, but Xury was my better coun-
sellor, and said to me, ‘ No go, no go.’ However, I
hauled in nearer the shore, that I might talk to them,
and I found they ran along the shore by me a good
way. I observed they had no weapons in their
hands, except one, who had a long slender stick,
which Xury said was a lance, and that they would
throw them a great way with good aim: so I kept at
a distance, but talked with them by signs as well as
I could, and particularly made signs for something to
eatI They beckoned to me to stop my boat, and they
would fetch rne some meat. Upon this I lowered
the top of my sail, and lay by, and two of them ran up
into the country, and in less than half an hour came
back, and brought with them two pieces of dry esh,
and some corn, such as is the produce of their coun~
try ; but we neither knew what the one or the other
was: however, we were willing to accept it. But
how to come at it, was our next dispute, for I was
not for venturing on shore to them, and they were
as much afraid of us; but they took a safe way for
us all, for they brought it to the shore, and ‘laid it
down, and went and stood a great way off, till we
fetched it on board, and then came close to us
again.
We made signs of thanks to them, for we had no-
thing to make them amends; but a'n opportunity of-
fered that very instant to oblige them wonderfully-;
£pr while we were lying by the shore, came twe
mighty creatures, one pursuing the other (as we took
it) with great fury, from the mountains towards the
sea: whether it was the male pursuing the female,
or whether they were in sport or in rage, we could
not tell any more than we could tell whether it was
usual or strange ; but I believe it was the latter, be-
cause, in_thc rst place, those ravenous creatures
seldom appear but in the night; and, in the second
place, we found the people terribly frightecl, espe-
cially the women. The man that had the lance or
dart did not y from them, but the rest did. How-
ever, as the two creatures ran directly into the
water, they did not seem to offer to fall upon the
Negroes, but plunged themselves into the_ sea, and
swam about as if they had come for their diversion ;
at last one of them began to come nearer our_boat
than at rst I expected, but I lay ready for him, for
I had loaded my gun with all possible expedition,
and bade. Xury load both the others. As soon as he
came fairly within my reach, I red, and shot him
directly into the head. Immediately he sunk down
into the water, but he rose instantly, and plunged up
and down as if he was struggling for life; and so in-
deed he was. He immediately made to the shore;
but, between the wound, which was his mortal hurt,
and the strangling of the water, he died just before
hereached the shore. - _ .
It is impossible to express the astonishment of
these poor creatures at the noise andiire of my gun:
some of them were ready even to die for fear, and
fell down as dead with the very terror. But when
they saw the creature dead, and sunk in -the
water, and that I made signs to them to come to the
‘shore, they took heart, and came to the shore, and
began to search for the creature. I found .him by
his blood staining the water, and by the help of a
rope, which I ung round him, and gave the Negroes
to haul, they dragged him on shore,_and found that
it was a most curious leopard, spotted and ne to
an admirable.dcgrQe; and the Negroes held up their
hands with admiration, to think whatit was I killed
him with. _
The other creature, frighted with the ash of re,
and the noise of the gun, swam to the shore, and
ran up directly to the mountains, from whence they
came, nor could I at that distance know what it
was. I found quickly the Negroes were for eating
the esh of this creature, so I was willing to have
them take -it as a favour from me, which, when I
made signs to them that they might take him, they
were very thankful for. Immediately they fell to
work with him, and though they had no knife, yet
with a sharpened piece of wood they took off his
skin as readily, nay, much more readily than we
would have done with a knife. They ocred me some
of the esh, which I declined, making as if I would
give it them, but made signs for the skin, which
they -gave me very freely, and brought me a great
deal more of their provision, which though I did not
understand, yet I accepted. 'I‘hen l made signs to
them for some water, and held out one of my‘ jars to
them, turning its bottom upward, to show that it
was empty, and that I wanted to have it lilled.
They called immediately to some of their friends,
and there came two women, and brought a great
vessel made of earth, and burnt, as I suppose, in the
sun : this they set down for me, as before, and _I_ sent
Xury on shore with my jars, and lled them all
.three. The women were as stark naked as the
men. .
I was now furnished with roots and corn, such as
it was, and water; and, leaving my friendly Negroes,
I made forward for about eleven days more,,with-
out offering to go near the shore, till I saw the land
run out a great length into the sea, at about the di-
stance of four or live leagues before me, and, the
sea being very calm, I kept a large ofng to make
this point; at length, doubling the point at about
two leagues from the land, I saw plainly land on
the other side to seaward; then I concluded, as it
was most certain indeed, that this was the Cape de
Verd, and those the islands, called from thence
Cape de Verd Islands. However, they were at a
great distance, and I could not well tell what I had
best to do; for if [ should he taken with a fresh of
wind, I might neither reach one nor other.
In this dilemma, as I was very pensive, I stepped
into the cabin, and sat me down, Xury having the
helm, when on a sudden the boy cried out, ‘ Ma-
ster, master, a ship was a sail !’ and the foolish boy
was frighted out of his wits, thinking it must needs
be some of his master’s ships sent to pursue us.
when I knew we were gotten far enough out of
their reach. I jumped out of the cabin, and innue-
diately saw not only the ship, but what she was;
viz. that it was a Portuguese ship, and, as I thought,
was bound to the coast of Guinea for Negroes. But
when I observed the course she steered, I was soon
convinced they were bound some other way, and
did not design to go any nearer to the shore, upon
which I stretched out to sea as much as I could,
resolving to speak with them, if possible.
With all the sail I could make, I found I should
not be able to come in their way, but that they
would he gone by before I could make any signal to
them; but aftcr I had crowded to the utmost, and
began to despair, they, it seems, saw me by the
help of their perspective-glasses, and thatlit was
some European boat, which they supposed must be-
long to some ship that was lost; so they shortened
sail to let me come up. I was encouraged with this,
and as I had my patron's ancient on board, I made
a waft of it to them for a signal of distress, and
red a gun, both which they saw; for they told me
they saw the smoke, though they did not hear the
gun. Upon these signals they very kindly brought
to, and lay by for me, and in about three hours
time I. came up with them.
They asked me what I was in Portuguese, and in
Spanish, and in French; but I understood noine of
them‘: but at last a Scots sailor, who was on board,
called to me, and I answered him, and told him I
was an Englishman, that I had made my escape out
of slavery from the Moors at Sallee. Then they bade
me come on board, and very kindly tookme in, and
all my goods. " “
It was an inexpressible joy to me, that any one
will believe, that I was thus delivered, as [esteemed
it, from such a miserable ‘and almost hopeless con-
dition as I was in. I immediately olfered all I had
to the captain of the ship, as a return for my deli-
verance; but he generously told me, he would take
nothing from me, but that all I had should be deli-
vered safe to me when l came to the ‘llrasils. ‘ For,’
says he, ‘ I have saved your life ‘on no other terms
than as I would be glad to be saved myself; and it
may one time oriother be my lot to he taken up in
the same condition. Besides,’ says he, ‘when I carry
you to the Brasils, so great a way from your own
country, if I should take from you what little you
have, you will be starved there, and then I only take
away that life I have given. " No, no,’ says he, ‘Sig-
nor Inglese [Mr. Englishman], I will carry you thi-
ther in charity, and these things will help you to
buy your subsistence there, and your passage home
again.’ I _
As he was charitable in this proposal, so he was
just in the performance to a tittle; for he ordered the
seamen that none should offer to touch any thing I
ha-d: then he took every thing intohis'own posses-
sion, and gave me back an exact inventory of them,
that I might have them again, even so much as my
three earthen jars. g p
As to my boat, it was a 'very good one, and that
he saw, and told me he would buy it of me for the
ship's use, and asked me what I would -have for it.
I told him he had been so generous to in every
thing, thatl could not offer to make any priceof the
boat, but left it entirely to him; upon which he told
me he would give me a note of his hand to pay me
C 2
80 pieces of eight for it at Brasil, and when it came
there, if any one oered to give more, he would
make it up. He oflered me also 60 pieces of eight
more for my boy, Xury,which I was loath to take;
not that I was not willing to let the captain have
him, but I was very loath to sell the poor boy's
liberty, who had assisted me so faithfully in procur-
ing my own. However, when I let him know my
reason, he owned it to be just, and offered me this
medium, that he would give the boy an obligation
to set him free in ten years, if he turned Christian.
Upon this, Xury saying he was willing to go to
him, I let the captain have him.
We had a very good voyage to the Brasils, a-nd
arrived in the Bay de todos los Santos, or All-Saints
Bay, in about twenty-two days after. And now I
was once more delivered from the most miserable of
all conditions of life ; and what to do next with my-
self, I was to consider.
The generous treatment the captain gave me, I
can never enough remember: he would take nothing
of me for my passage, gave me 20 ducats for the
leopard’s skin, and 40 for the lion’s skin, which I had
in the boat, and caused every thing I had in the
ship to be punctually delivered me; and what I was
willing to sell, he bought, such as the case of bot-
tles, two of my guns, and a piece of the lump of
bees-wax, for I had made candles of the rest: in a
word, I made about 220 pieces of eight of all my
cargo, and with this stock I went on shore in the
Brasils.
I had not been long here, but being recommended
to the house of a good honest man like himself, who
had an ingenio, as they call it, that is, a plantation
and a sugar-house, I lived with him some time, and
acquainted myself by that means with the manner
of their planting and making of sugar; and seeing
how well the planters lived, and how they grew
rich suddenly, I resolved, if I could get licence to
settle there, I would turn planter among them; re-
solving, in the mean time, to nd out some way to
get my money which I had left in London remitted
to me. To this purpose, getting a kind of a letter
of naturalization, I purchased as much land that was
uncured as my money would reach, and formed a
plan for my plantation and settlement, and such a
one as might be suitable to the stock which I pro-
posed to myself to receive from England.
1 had a neighbour, a Portuguese of Lisbon, but
born of English parents, whose name was Wells, and
in much such circumstances as I was. I call him
neighbour, because his plantation lay next to mine,
and we went on very sociably together: my stock
was but low as well as his, and we rather planted
for food than any thing else for about two years.
However, we began to increase, and our land began
to come into order, so that the third year we planted
some tobacco, and made each of us a large piece of
ground ready for planting canes in the year to come;
but we both wanted help; and now I found, more
than before, I had done wrong in parting with my
boy, Xury. I
But, alas! for me to do wrong that never did
right, was no great wonder. I had no remedy but
to go on. I was gotten into an employment quite
remote to my genius, and directly contrary to the
life I delighted in, and for which I forsook my fa-
ther’s house, and broke through all his good advice;
nay, 1 was coming into the very middle station, or
upper degree of low life, which my father advised
me to before, and which, if I resolved to go on with,
I might as well have staid at home, and never fa-
tigued myself in the world, as I have done: and I
used often to say to myself, I could have done this
as well in England among my friends, as have gone
5000 miles elf to do it among strangers and savages
in a wilderness, and at such a distance as never to
hear from any part of the world that had the least
knowledge of me.
In this manner I used to look upon my condition
with the utmost regret. I had nobody to converse
with, but now and then this. neighberurz no work to
be done but by the labour of my hands; and I used
to say, I lived just like a man cast away upon some
desolate island, that had nobody there but himself.
But how just has it been, and how should all men
reect, that, when they compare their present con-
dition with others that are worse’, Heaven may
oblige them to make the exchange, and be convinced
of their former felicity, by their experience! I say,
how just has it been, that the truly solitary life I
reected on in an island of mere desolation should
be my lot, who had so often unjustl y compared it
with the life which I then led,,in which, had 1 con-
tinued, I had, in all probability, been exceedingly
prosperous and rich !
~ I was in some degree settled in my measures for
carrying on the plantation, before my kind friend,
the captain of the ship that took me up at sea, went
back ; for the ship remained there _in y providing her
loading, and preparing for her voyage, near three
months; when, telling him what little stock I had
left behind me in London, he gave me this friendly
and sincere advice: ‘ Signor I nglese,’ says he (for
so he always called me), ‘ ll’ you will give me letters,
land a procuration here in form to me, with orders
to the -person who has your money in London, to
send your effects to Lisbon, to such persons as I
shall direct, and in .such goods as are proper for this
country, I will bring you the produce of them, God
willing, at my return ; but, since human a’airs are
all subject to changes and disasters, 1 would have
you give orders but for '100l.sterling, which, you say,
is half your stock-, and let the hazard be run for the
rst, I so that if it come safe, you may order the rest
the same way, and if it miscarry, you may have the
other half to have recourse to for your supply ,' .
- This was so wholesome advice, and looked so
friendly, that I could not but be convinced it was
the best course I could take; so I accordingly pre-
pared letters to the gentlewoman with whom I had
left my money, and a procuration to the Portuguese
captain, as he desired.
I wrote the English captain’s widow a full ae-
count of all my adventures, my slavery, escape, and
how I had met with the Portugal captain at sea, the
humanity of his behaviour, and what condition I
was now in, with‘ all other necessary directions for
my supply ; and when this honest captain came to
Lisbon, he found means, by some of the English
merchants there, to send over not the order only,
_but a full account of my story, to a merchant at Lon-
don, who presented it effectually to her; whereupon
she not only delivered the money, but out of her
own pocket sent the Portugal captain a very hand-
some present for his humanity and charity to me.
The merchant in London vested this 1006. in Eng-
lish goods, such asthe captain had written for, sent
them directly to him at Lisbon, and‘ he brought them
all safe to me to the Brasils ; among which, without
my direction (for I was too young in my business to
think of them), he had taken care to have all sorts
of tools, iron-work, and utensils necessary for my
plantation, and which were of great use to me.
When this cargo arrived, I thought my fortune
made,.for I was surprised with the joy of it; and
any good steward, the captain,-had laid out the 51.
which my friend had sent him for a present for him-
self, to purchase and bring me over a servant, un-
der bond for six years’ service, and would not accept
of any consideration, except a little tobacco, which I
would have him accept, being of my own produce.
Neither was this all; but my goods being all Eng-
lish manufactures, such as cloth, stu”, baizc, and
things particularly valuable and desirable in~ the
country, I found means to sell them to a very» great
advantage; so that I~ maysay, I had more than four
times the value of my rst cargo, and was now rin-
nitely beyond my poor neighbour, I mean in the
_advanee1nent;of my plantation ; for the rsttliillg I
did, I bought me a Negro slave and an European
servant also: I mean another besides that which the
captain brought me from Lisbon. '
But as abused prosperity is oftentimes made the
very means of our greatest adversity, so was it with
me. I went on the next year with great success in
my plantation: I raised fty great rolls of tobacco
on my own ground, more than I had disposed of for-
necessaries among my neighbours, and these fty
rolls being each of above 1001b. weight, were well
cured and laid by against the return of the eet from
Lisbon. And now increasing in business and wealth,
my head began to be full of projects and undertak'-
ings beyond my reach, such as are indeed often the
ruin of the best heads in business.
Had I continued in the station I was now in, I
had room for all the happy things to have yet be-
fallen me, for which my father so earnestly recom-
mended a quiet retired life, and which he had so
sensibly described the middle station of life to be
full of; but other things attended me,and I was still
to be the wilful agent of all my own miseries: and
particularly to increase my fault, and double the re-
ections upon myself which in my future sorrows I
should have leisure to make; all these miscarriages
were procured by my apparent obstinate adhering
to my foolish inclination of wandering abroad, and
"pursuing that inclination in contradiction to the
clearest views of doing myself good in a fair and
plain pursuit of those prospects, and those measures
of life, which Nature and Providence concurred to
present me with, and to make my duty.
As I had once done thus in breaking away from
my parents, so I could not be content now; but I
must go and leave the happy view I had of being a
rich and thriving man in my new plantation, only
to pursue a rash and immoderate desire of rising
faster than the nature of the thing admitted; and
thus I cast myself down again into the deepest gulf
of human misery that ever man fell into, or per-
la/aps could ‘be consistent with life, and a state of
health, in the world.
To come then by just degrees to the particulars of
this part of my story. You may suppose that having
now lived almost four years in the Brasils, and be-
ginning to thrive and prosper very well upon‘ my
plantation, I had not only learned the language, but
had contracted acquaintance and friendship among
my fellow-planters, as well as among the merchants
at St. Salvadorc, which was our port, and that, in
my discourse among them, I had frequently given
them an account of my two voyages to' the coast of
Guinea, the manner of trading with the Negroes
there, and how easy it was to purchase upon the
coast, for trifles, such as beads, toys, knives, scissars,
-hatchets, bits of glass, and the like, not only gold-
dust, Guinea-grains, elephants’ teeth, &c. but Ne-
groes for the service of the Brasils, in great numbers.
They listened always very attentively to my dis-
courses on these heads, but especially to that part
which related to the buying Negroes, which was a
trade at that time not only not far entered into, but,
as far as it was,had been carried on by the assientos,
or permission of the kings of Spain and Portugal,and
engrossed in the public stock, so that few Negroes
were bought, and those excessive dear.
It happened, being in company one day with some
merchants and planters of my acquaintance, and
talking of those things very earnestly, three of them
came to me the next morning, and told me they had
been musing very much upon what I had discoursed
of with them the last night, and they came to make
a secret proposal to me; and, after enjoining me
secrecy, they told me that they had a mind to fit
out a ship to go to Guinea; that they had all planta-
tions as well as I, and were straitcned for nothing
so much as servants; that as it was a trade that
could not be carried on, because they could not
publicly sell the Negroes when they came home,
so they desired to make but one voyage, to bring
the Negroes on shore privately, and divide them
among their own plantations; and, in a word, the
question was, whether I would go their supercargo
in the' ship, to manage the trading part upon the
coast of Guinea? and they offered me thatl should
have my equal share of the Negroes, without provid-
ing any part of the stock.
This was a fair proposal, it must be confessed, had
it been made to any one that had not had a settle-
ment and plantation of his own to look after, which
was in a fair way of coming to be very considerable,
and with a good stock upon it. But for me that was
thus established, and had nothing to do but go on as I
had begun for three or four years more, and to have
sent for the other 1005. from England, and who in
that time, and with that little addition, could scarce
have failed of being worth 3 or 4000 Z. sterling, and
that increasing too; for me to think of such a voyage,
was the most preposterous thing that ever man, in
such circumstances, could be guilty of.
But I, that was born to be my own destroyer,
could no more resist the offer, than I could re-
strain my rst rambling designs, when my fathcr’s
good counsel was lost upon me. In a word, I told
them I would go with all my heart, if they would
undertake to look after my plantation in my ab-
sence, and would dispose of it to such as I should
direct, if I miscarried. This they all engaged to do,
and entered into writings or covenants to do so;
and I made a formal will, disposing of my planta-
tion and effects, in case of my death, making the
captain of the ship that had saved my life, as before,
my universal heir, but obliging him to dispose of my
effects as I had directed in my will: one half of the
produce being to himself, and the other to be shipped
to England.
In short, I took all possible caution to preserve
my eifeets, and to keep up my plantation. Had I
used half as much prudence to have looked into my
own interest, and have made a judgement of what I
ought to have done, and not to have done, Iliad
certainly never gone away from so prosperous an
undertaking, leaving all the probable views of a
thriving eir<:umstanee, and gone upon a voyage to
sea, attended with all its common hazards, to say
nothing of the reasons 1 had to expect particular
misfortunes to myself.
But I was hurried on, and obeyed blindly the dic-
tatcs of my fancy. rather than my reason; and, ac-
cordingly, the ship being tted out, and the cargo
furnished, and all things done as by agreement by
my partners in the voyage, I went on board in an
cvil hour again, tlic lst of September, 1659, being
the same day eight years that l went from my father
and mother at Ilull, in order to act the rebel to their
authority, and the fool to my own interest.
Our ship was about IQO tons burden, carried six
guns, and fourteen men, besides the master, his boy,
and myself. We had on board no large cargo of
goods, except of such toys as were t for our trade
with the Negroes, such as beads, bits of glass,
shells, and odd tritles, especially little looking-glasses,
knives, scissars, hatehets, and the like. .
The same day I went on board, we set sail, stand-
ing away to the northward upon our own coast,
with design to stretch over for the African coast,
when they came into about ten or twelve degrees of
northern latitude, which, it seems, was the manner of
their course in those days. We had very good wea-
ther, only excessive hot all the way upon our own
coast, till we came to the height of Cape St. Augus~
tino, from whence keeping farther o“ at sea, we lost
sight of land, and steered as if we were bound for
the I sle of Fernand do Noronba, holding our course
N. E. by N. and leaving those isles on the cast. In
this course we passed the line in about twelve
days’ time, and were, by our last observation, in
7 degrees, 22 minutes, northern latitude, when a
violent tornado or hurricane took us quite out of
our knowledge: it began from the southeast, came
about to the north-west, and then settled into the
north-east, from whence it blew in such a terrible
manner, that for twelve days together we could do
nothing but drive; and scudding away before it, let
it carry us wherever fate and- the fury of the winds
directed: and during these twelve days, I need not
say that I expected every day to be swallowed up,
nor did any in the ship expect to save their lives.
ln this distress we had, besides the terror of the
storm,one of our men died of the calenture, and one
man and the boy washed overboard. About the
twelfth day, the weather abating a little, the master
made an observation as well as he could, and found
that he was in about 11 degrees of north latitude,
but that he was 22 degrees of longitude difference
west from Cape St. Augustine, so that he found he
was gotten upon the coast of Guiana, or the north
part of Brasil, beyond the river Amazones, towards
that of the river Oroonoque, commonly called the
Great River: and now-he began to consult with me
what course he should take, for the ship was leaky,
and very much disabled, and he was for going di-
rectly back to the coast of Brasil.
I was positively against that; and, looking over
the charts of the sea-coast of America with him, we
concluded there was no inhabited country for us to
have recourse to, till we came within the circle of
the Caribbee Islands, and therefore resolved to stand
away for Barbadoes, which, by keeping off at sea,
to avoid the in-draught of the Bay or Gulf of
Mexico, we might easily perform, as we hoped, in
about fteeen days’ sail: whereas we could not pos-
’sibly make our voyage to the coast of Africa, with-
out sonie assistance ‘both to our ship, and to our-
selves. _
“With this design, we changed our course, and
steered away ‘N.W. by-W.‘ in- order to reach'some
of our English islands, where I hoped for relief;
but our voyage was otherwise determined: for, being
in the latitude of 12 degrees, 18 minutes, a second
storm came upon us, which carried us away with
the same impetuosity westward, and drove us so
out of the very way of all human commerce, that
had all our lives been saved, as to the sea, we were
rather in danger of being devoured by savages, than
ever returning to our own country.
ln this distress, the wind still blowing very hard,
one of our men, early one morning, cried out,
‘ Land !’ and we had no sooner run out of the cabin
to look out, in hopes of seeing whereabouts in the
world we were, but the ship struck upon a sand,
and, in a moment, her motion being so stopped, the
sea broke over her in such a manner that we ex-
pected we should all have perished immediately;
and we were even driven into our close quarters,
to shelter us from the very foam and spray of the
sea.
It is not easy for any one, who has not been in
the like condition, to describe or conceive the con-
sternation oi’ men in such circumstances. We knew
nothing where we were, or upon what land it was
we were driven, whether an island or the main, whe-
ther inhabited or not inhabited; and as the rage of
the wind was still great, though rather less than at
rst, we could not so much as hope to have the ship
hold many minutes without breaking in pieces, unless
the winds, by a kind of miracle, should turn imme-
diately about. In a word, we sat looking one upon
another, and expecting death every moment, and
every man acting accordingly, as preparing for an-
other world, for there was little or nothing more for
us to do in this: that which was our present com-
fort, and all the comfort we had, was that, contrary
to our expectation, the ship did not break yet, and
that the master said the wind beg-an to abate.
Now, though we thought that the wind did a
little abate, yet the ship having thus struck upon
the sand, and sticking too fast for us to expect her
getting oil’, we were in a dreadful‘ condition indeed,
and had nothing to do, but to think of saving, our
lives as well as we could. We had a boat at our
stern, just before the storm, but she was rst staved
by dashing against the ship’s rudder, and in the
next place she broke away, and either sunk or was
driven oil’ to sea, so there was no hope from her.
We had another boat on board, but how to get h'er
off into the sea, was a doubtful thing. However,
there was no room to debate, for we fancied the
ship would break in pieces every minute; and some
told us she was actually broken already.
In this distress, the mate of our vessel lays hold
of the boat, and with the help of the rest. of the
men, they got her ung over the ship’s side, and
getting all into her, let go, and committed ourselves,
being eleven in number, to God's mercy, and the
wild sea; for though the storm was abated consider-
ably, yet the sea went dreadfully high upon the
shore, and might well be called, ‘ Den wild zee,’ as
the Dutch call the sea in a storm.
And now our case was very dismal indeed, for we
all saw plainly that the sea went so high, that the
boat could not escape, and that we should be in-
evitably drowned. As to malging sail, we had none;
nor, if we had, could we have done any thing with
it; so we worked at the oar towards the land, though
with heavy hearts, like men going to execution; for
we all knew, that when the boat came near the
shore, she would be dashed in a thousand pieces,
by the breach of the sea. However, we committed
our souls to God in the most earnest manner, and
the wind driving us towards the shore, we hastened
our destruction with our own hands, pulling, as well
as we could, towards land.
What the shore was, whether rock or sand, whe~
ther steep or shoal, we knew not; the only hope
that could rationally give us the least shadow of
expectation, was, if we might happen into some bay
or gulf, or the mouth of some river, where, by great
chance, we might have run our boat in, or got under
the lee of the land, and perhaps made smooth Water.
But there was nothing of this appeared; but as we
made nearer and nearer the shore, the land looked
more frightful than the sea.
After we had rowed, or rather driven, about a
league and a half, as we reckoned it, a raging wave,
mountain-like, came rolling astern of us, and plainly
bade us expect the ‘ coup de grace.’ In a word, it
took us with such a fury, that it overset the boat
at once, and separating us as well from the boat
as from one another, gave us not time hardly to
say, ‘ 0 God!’ for we were all swallowed up in a
moment.
Nothing can describe the confusion of thought
which I felt when I sunk into the water, for though
I swam very well, yet I could not deliver myself
from the waves so as to draw breath, till that wave
having driven me, or rather carried me a vast way
on towards the shore, and having spent itself, went
back, and left me upon the land almost dry, but
half dead with the water I took in. I had so much
presence of mind, as well as breath left, that seeing
myself nearer the main land than I expected, I got
upon my feet, and endeavoured to make on towards
the land, as fast as I could, before another wave
should return, and take me up again. But I soon
found ‘it was impossible to avoid it, for I saw the
sea come after me as high as a great hill, and as
furious as an enemy, which I had no means or
strength to contend with; my business was to hold
my breath, and raise myself upon the water, if [
could, and so by swimming to preserve my breath-
ing, and pilot myself towards the shore, if possible;
my greatest concern now being that the wave, as it
would carry me a great way towards the shore when
it came on, might not carry me back again with it,
when it gave back towards the sea.
The wave that came upon me again, buried me at
once twenty or thirty feet deep in its own body, and
I could feel myself carried with a mighty force and
swiftness towards the shore a very great way ; but I
held my breath, and assisted myself to swim still
forward with all my might. I was ready to burst
with holding my breath, when, as I felt myself
rising up, so to my immediate relief, I found my
head and hands shoot out above the surface of the
water; and though it was not two seconds of time
that I could keep myself so, yet it relieved me
greatly, gave me breath and new courage. I was
covered again with water a good while, but not so
long but I held it out, and ‘nding the water had
spent itself, and began to return, I struck forward
against the return of the waves, and felt ground
again with my feet. I stood still a few moments to
recover breath, and till the water went from m_'c,
and then I took to my heels, and ran with what
strength I had, farther towards the shore. But
neither would this deliver me from the fury of the
sea, which came pouring in after me again, and
twice more I was lifted up by the waves, and ear-
ried forwards as before, the shore being very at.
The last time of these two had well near been
fatal to me; for the sea having hurried me along as
before, landed me, or rather dashed me, against a
piece of a rock, and that with such force as it left
me senseless, and indeed helpless, as to my own
deliverance; for the blow taking my side and breast,
beat the breath, as it were, quite out of my body,
and had it returned again immediately, I must have
been strangled in the water; but I recovered a
little before the return of the waves, and, seeing I
should be covered again with the water, I resolved
to hold fast by a piece of the rock, and so to hold
my breath, if possible, till the wave went back.
Now, as the waves were not so high as at rst, being
near land, I held my hold till the wave abated, and
then fetched another run, which brought me so near
the shore, that the next wave, though it went over
me, yet did not so swallow me up as to carry me
away; and the next run I took, I got to the main
land, where, to my great comfort, I elambered up
the cliffs of the shore, and sat me down upon the
grass, free from danger, and quite out of the reach
of the water. . i
I was now landed, and safe on shore, and began
to look up and -thank.God that my life was saved,
in a case wherein, there was some minutes before
scarce any room to hope. I believe it is impossible
to express to the life, what the ecstasies and trans-
ports of the soul are when it is so saved, as I may
say, out of the very grave: and 1 do not wonder
now at that custom, viz. that when a malefactor, who
has the halter about his neck, is tl(.’Li up,.and just
going to be turned off, and has a reprieve. brought
to him; I say, I do not wonder that they bring a
surgeon with it, to let him blood that very mo-
ment they tell him of it, that the surprise may not
drive the animal spirits from the heart, and over-
whelm him: .
For sudden joys, like griefs, confound at rst.
~ I walked about on the shore, lifting up my hands,
and my whole being, us I may say, wrapt up in the
contemplation of my deliverance, making a thousand
gestures and motions which I cannot describe,'re-
eeting upon all my comrades that were drowned,
and that there should not be one soul saved but
myself: for, as for them, I never saw them after-
wards, or any sign of them, except three of their
hats, one cap, and two shoes that were not fellows.
I cast my eyes to the stranded vessel, when the
breach and froth of the sea being so big, I could
hardly see it, it lay so far off; and considered,
Lord ! how was it possible I could get on shore !
After I had solaced my mind with the comfortable
part of my condition, 1 began to look round me, to
see what kind of place I was in, and what was next
to be done, and I soon found my comforts abate,
and that, in a word, I had a dreadful deliverance;
for I was wet, had no clothes to shift me, nor any
thing either to eat or drink to comfort me, neither
did 1 soeany prospect before me, but that of pc_rish_
ing with hunger, or being devoured by wild boasts:
and that which was particularly afflicting to me,
was, that I had no weapon either to hunt and kill
any creature for my sustenance, or to defend my-
self against any othercreature that might desire to
kill me for theirs. 1n a word, I had nothing about
me but a knife, a tobacco-pipe, and a little tobacco
in a box; this was all my provision, and this threw
mo into terrible agonies of mind, that for a while I
ran about like a madman. Night coming upon me,
I began, with a heavy heart, to consider what
would be my lot, if there were any ravenous beasts
in that country, seeing at night they always come
abroad for their prey. . ~
All the remedy that offered to my thoughts at
that time, was, to get up into a thick bushy tree,
like a r, but thorny, which grew near me, and
where I resolved to sit all night, and consider the
next day what death 1 should die ; for,'as yet, I saw
no prospect of life. I walked about a furlong from
the shore, to see if I could nd any fresh water to
drink, which I did to my great joy; and having
drankyand put a little tobacco in my mouth, to pre-
vent hunger, I went to the tree, and getting up into
it, endeavoured to place myself so as that, if I
should sleep, I might not fall; and having cut me a
short stick, like a truncheon, for my defence, I took
up my lodging; and having been excessively fa-
tigued, I fell fast asleep, and slept as comfortably
as I believe few could have done in my condition;
and found myself the most refreshed with it that I
think I ever was on such occasion.
When I waked, it was broad day, the weather
clear, and the storm abated, so that the sea did not
rage and swell as before ;- but that which surprised
me most, was, that the ship was lifted off, in the
night, from the sand where she lay, by the swelling
of the tide, and was driven up almost as far as the
rock, which I rst mentioned, where I had been so
bruised by the dashing me against it. This being
within about a mile from the shore where Iwas, and
the ship seeming to stand upright. still, I wished
myself on board, that, at least, I might save some
necessary things for my use.
When I came down from my apartment in the
tree, I looked about me again, and the rst thing I
found was the boat, which lay as the wind and the
sea had tossed her upon the land, about two miles
on my right hand. I walked as far as I could upon
the shore, to havegot to her, but found a neck or
inlet of water between me and the boat, which was
about half a mile broad ; so I came back for the
present, being-more intent upon getting at the ship,
where I hoped to nd something for my present
subsistence.
A little after noon I found the sea very calm, and
the tide ebbed so far out, that I could come within
a quarter of a mile of the ship: and here I found a
fresh renewing of my grief; for I saw evidently that
if we had kept on board we had been all safe, that
is~to say, we had all got safe on shore, and I had
not been so miserable as to"be left entirely destitute
of all comfort and company, as I now was. This
forced tears from my eyes again: ; but as there was
little relief in that, I resolved, if possible, to get to
the ship; so I pulled off my clothes, for the weather
was hot to extremity, and took the water; but,
when I came to the ship, my diicul-ty was still
greater to know how to get on hoard; for as she lay
aground, and high out of the water, there was no-
thing within my reach to lay hold of. I swam round
her twice,‘ and the second time I espied a small
piece of rope,‘ which Iwondered I did not see at rst,
hang down by the fore-chains, so low as that with
great diiculty I get hold of it, and, by the help of
that rope, got up into the forecastle of the ship.
Here I found that the ship was bulged, and had a
great deal of water in her hold, but that she lay so
D
on the side of a bank of hard sand, or rather earth,
that her stern lay lifted up upon the bank, and her
head low almost to the water; by this means all her
quarter was free, and all that was in that part was
dry: for you may be sure my rst work was to search
and to see what was spoiled, and what was free; and
rst I found that all the ship’s provisions were dry
and untouched by the water; and being very well
disposed to eat, I went to the bread-room, and lled
my pockets with biscuit, and eat it as I went about
other things, for I had no time to lose. I also found
some rum in the great cabin, of which I took a large
dram, and which I had indeed need enough of, to
spirit me for what was before me. New I wanted
nothing but a boat to furnish myself with many
things which I foresaw would be very necessary to
me. .
It was in vain to sit still and wish for what was
not to be had, and this extremity roused my applica-
tion. We had several spare yards, and two or three
large spars of wood, and a spare top-mast or two in
the ship; I resolved to fall to work with these, and
ung as many of them overboard as I could manage
for their weight, tying every one with a rope, that
they might not drive away. When this was done, I
went down the ship’s side, and pulling them to me,
Itied four of them fast together at both ends, as
well as I could, in the form of araft, and laying two
or three short pieces of plank upon them crossways,
I found I could walk upon it very well, but that it
was not able to bear any great weight, the pieces
being too light; so I went to work, and,with a car-
penter’s saw, I cut a spare top-mast into three
lengths, and added them to my raft, with a great
deal of labour and pains; but the hope of furnish-
ing myself with necessaries encouraged me to go
beyond what I should have been able to have done
upon another occasion.
My raft was now strong enough to bear any rea-
sonable weight. My next care was what to load it
with, and how to preserve what I laid upon it from
the surf of the sea: but I was not long considering
this; I rst laid all the planks or boards upon it
that I could get, and having considered well what I
most wanted, I rst got three of the seamen’s chests,
which I had broken open and emptied, and» lowered
them down upon my raft. The rst of these I lled
with provisions, viz. bread, rice, three Dutch cheeses,
ve pieces of dried goat’s flesh, which we lived
much upon, and a little remainder of European corn,
which had been laid by for some fowls which we
brought to sea with us, but the fowls were killed:
there had been some barley and wheat together, but,
to my great disappointment, I found afterwards that
the rats had eaten or spoiled it all. As for liquors,
I found several cases of bottles belonging to our
skipper, in which were some cordial waters, and in
all about ve or six gallons of arrack: these I stowed
by themselves, there being no need to put them into
the chest, nor any room for them. While I was do-
ing this, I found the tide began to ow, though very
calm, and I had the mortication to see my coat,
shirt, and waistcoat, which I had left on shore upon
the sand, swim aw-ay; as for my breeches, which were
only linen and open-knee’d, 1 swam on board in them
and my stockings. However, this put me upon rum-
maging for clothes, of which I found enough, but
took no more than I wanted for present use, for
I had other things which my eye was more upon:
as rst, tools to work with on shore, and it was after
long searching that I found out the carpenter’s
chest, which was indeed a very useful prize tome,
and much more valuable than a ship-loading of gold
would have been at that time. I got it down to my
raft, even whole as it was, without losing time to look
into it, for I knew in general what it contained.
My next care was for some ammunition and arms.
There were two very good fowling-pieces in the great
cabin, and two pistols; these I secured rst, with
some powder-horns, a small bag of shot, and two
old rusty swords. I knew there were three barrels
of powder in the ship, but knew not where our gun~
ner had stowed them, but with much search I found
them, two of them dry and good, the third had
taken water: those two I got to my raft, with the
arms. And now I thought myself pretty well
freighted, and began to think how I should get to
shore with them, having neither sail, oar, or rudder,
and the least cap-full of wind would have overset all
my navigation.
I had three encouragements. First, A smooth and
calm sea. Secondly, T he tide rising and setting in to
the shore. Third] y,W hat little wind there was, blew
me towards the land. And thus, having found two
or three broken oars belonging to the boat, and be-
sides the tools which were in the chest, I found two
saws, an ax, and a hammer, and with this cargo I
put to sea. For a mile, or thereabouts, my raft
went very well, only that I found it drive a little
distant from the place where I had landed before,
by which I perceived that there was some indraught
of the water, and consequently I hoped to nd some
creek or river there, which I might make use of as a
port to get to land with my cargo.
As I imagined, so it was: there appeared before
me a little opening of the land. I found a strong
current of the tide set into it, so I guided my raft as
well as I could, to keep in the middle of the stream.
Brut here I had like to have su'ered a second ship-
wreck, which, if I had, I think verily would have
broken my heart; for knowing nothing of the coast,
my raft run aground, at one end of it, upon a shoal,
and not being aground at the other end, it wanted
but a little that all my cargo had slipped off towards
that end that was aoat, and so fallen into the water :
I did my utmost by setting my back against the
chests, to keep them in their places, but could not
tlrrust off the raft with all my strength; neither
durst I stir from the posture I was in, but, holding
up the chests with all my might, stood in that man-
ner near half an hour, in which time the rising of
the water brought me a little more upona level; and
a little after, the water still rising, my raft oated
again, and I thrust her off with the oar I had, into
the channel, and then driving up higher, I at length
found myself in the mouth of a little river, with
land on both sides, and a strong current of tide run-
ning up. I looked on both sides for a proper place
to get to shore, for I was not willing to be driven
too high up the river, hoping in time to see some
ship at sea, and therefore resolved to place myself
as near the coast as I could. _
At length I spied a little cove on the right shore
of the creek, to which with great pain and difficulty
I guided my raft, and at last got so near, as that,
reaching ground with my oar, I could thrust her
directly in; but here I had like to have dipped all
my cargo in the sea again; for that shore lying pretty
steep, that is to say, sloping, there was no place to
land, but where one end of the oat, if it ran on
shore, would lie so high, and the other sink lower,
as before, that it would endanger my cargo again.
All that I could do, was to wait till the tide was at
the highest, keeping the raft with my oar, like an
anchor, to hold the side of it fast to the shore, near
a at piece of ground, which I expected the water
would flow over ; and so it did. As soon as I found
water enough (for my raft drew about a foot of
water), I thrust her upon that at piece of ground,
and there fastened or moored her, by sticking my
two broken oars into the ground, one on one side
near one end, and one on the other side near the
other end; and thus I lay till the water ebbed away,
and left my raft and all my cargo. safe on shore.
My next work was to view the country, and seek
a proper place for my habitation, and where to stow
my goods, to secure them from whatever might hap-
pen. Where I was, I yet k-new not; whether on the
continent, or on an island; whether inhabited, o.r
not inhabited 5 whether in danger of wild beasts or
not. There was a hill not above a mile from me,
which rose up very steep and high, and which seemed
to overtop some other hills, which lay as in a ridge
from it northward. I took out one of the fowling-
pieces, and one of the pistols, and a horn of pow-
der, and, thus armed, I travelled for discovery up to
the top of that hill, where, after I had with great
labour and diiculty got up, I immediately saw my
fate, to my great aliction; viz. that I was in an
island, environed every way with the sea, no land
to be seen, except some rocks, which lay a great
way off, and two small islands, less. than this, which
lay about three leagues to the west.
I fpund also that the island I was in was barren,
and, as I saw good reason to believe, uninhabited,
except by wild beasts, of which, however, I saw
none ; yet I saw abundance of fowls, but knew not
their kinds, neither, when I killed them, could I
tell what was t for food, and what not. At my
coming back, I shot at a great bird, which I saw
sitting upon a tree, on the side of a large wood. I
believe it was the rst gun that had been red there,
since the creation of the world. I had no sooner
red, but from all the parts of the wood there arose
an extraordinary number of fowls, of many sorts,
making a confused screaming and crying, every one
according to his usual note; but not one of them
of any kind that I knew. As for that creature I
killed, I took it to be a kind of a hawk, its colour
and beak resembling it, but it had no talons or claws
more than common : its esh was carrion, and t for
nothing.
Contented with this discovery, I came back to
my raft, and fell to work to bring my cargo on shore,
which took me up the rest of the day. What to do
with myself at night, I knew not, nor indeed where
to rest; for I was afraid to lie down on the ground,
not knowing but some wild beast might devour me,
though I afterwards found there was really no need
for those fears.
However, as well as I could, I barricadoed myself
round with the chests and boards that I had brought
on shore, and made a kind of a hut for that night's
lodging: as for food, I yet saw not which way to
supply myself, except that I had seen two or three
creatures, like hares, run out of the wood where I
shot the fowl.
I now began to consider that I might yet get a
great many things out of the ship, which would be
useful to me, and particularly some of the rigging
and sails, and such other things as might come to
hand, and I resolved to make another voyage on
board the vessel, if possible; and as I knew that the
rst storm that blew must necessarily break her all
in pieces, I resolved to set all other things apart,
till I got every thing out of the ship that I could
get: then I called a council, that is to say, in my
thoughts, whether I should take back the raft, but
this appeared impracticable, so I resolved to go as
before, when the tide was down, and I did so, only
that I stripped before I went from my hut, having
nothing on but a checkered shirt, a pair of linen
drawers, and a pair of pumps on my feet.
I got on board the ship as before, and prepared-a
second raft; and having had experience of the rst,
I neither made this so unwieldy, nor loaded it so
hard; but yet I brought away several things very
useful to me; as rst, in the carpenters store I found
two or three bags full of nails and spikes, a great
screw jack, a dozen or two of hatchets, and, above
all, that most useful thing called a grindstone: all
these I secured, together with several things belong-
ing to the gunner, particularly two or three iron
crows, and two barrels of musket bullets, seven mus-
kets, and another fowling-piece, with some small
qua.ntity of powder more; a large bag full of small
shot, and a great roll of sheet lead: but this last was
so heavy I could not hoist it up to get it over the
ship's side. -
Besides these things, I took all the men’s clothes
as y ROBINSON causes.
that I could .nd, and a spare fore~top-sail, ham~
mock, and some bedding; and with this I loaded
my second raft, and brought them also all safe on
shore, to my very great comfort.
I was under some apprehensions during,my ab-
sence from the land, that at least my provisions
might be devoured on shore; but when I came back,
I found no sign of any visitor, only there sat a crea-
ture like a wild cat upon one of the chests, which,
when I came towards it, ran away to a little di-
stance, and then stood still. She sat very composed
and unconcerned, and looked full in my face, as if
she had a mind to be acquainted with me. I pre-
sented my gun at her, but as she did not under-
stand it, she was perfectly unconcerned at it, nor
did she offer to stir away; upon which I tossed her
a bit of biscuit, though by the way I was not very
free of it, for my store was not great. However I
spared her a bit, I say, and she went to it, smelled
of it, and eat it, and looked (as pleased) for more;
but I thanked her, and could spare no more, so she
marched o°.
I-Iaving got my second cargo on shore (though I
was fain to open the barrels of powder, and bring
them by parcels, for they were too heavy, being large
casks), I went to work to make a little tent with the
sail and some poles which I cut for that purpose;
and into this tent I brought every thing that I
knew would spoil, either with rain or sun; and I piled
all the empty -chests and casks up in a circle round
the tent, to fortify it from any sudden attempt, either
from man or beast.
W_hen I had done this, I blocked up the door of
the tent with some boards within, and an empty
chest set up on end without, and spreading one of
the beds upon the ground, laying my two pistols just
at my head, and my gun at length by me, I went to
‘bed, for the rst time, and slept very quietly all
night, being very weary and heavy, for the night
before I had slept little, and had laboured very hard
all day, as well to fetch those things from the ship,
as to get them on shore. ‘
I had the biggest magazine of all kinds now that
ever were laid up, I believe, for one man; but I
was not satised still, for while the ship sat upright
in that posture, I thought I ought to get every thing
out of her that I could: so every day, at low water,
I went on board, and brought away something or
other. But particularly the third time I went, I
brought away as much of the rigging as I could, as
also all the small ropes and rope-twine I could get,
with a piece of spare canvas, which was to mend the
sails upon occasion, and the barrel of wet gunpow-
der. In a word, I brought away all the sails rst
and last, only that I was fain to cut them in pieces,
and bring as much at a time as I could; for they
were no more useful to me for sails, butas mere
canvas only. '
But that which comforted me more still, was, that
at last of all, after I had made ve or six such voy-
ages as these, and thought I had nothing more to
expect from the ship that was worth my meddling
with, I say, after all this, I found a great hogshead
of bread, three large runlets of rum or spirits, a
box of sugar, and a barrel of ne our: this was
surprising to me, because I had given over expect-
ing any more provisions, except what was spoiled
by the water. I soon emptied the hogshead of that
bread, and wrapt it up, parcel by parcel, in pieces
of the sails, which I cut out; and, in a word,
I got all this safe on shore also, though at several
times.
The next day I made another voyage, and now
having plundered the ship of what was portable, and
t to hand out, I began with the cables; and cutting
the great cable into pieces, such as I could move,
I got two cables and a haulser on shore, with all
the iron-work I could get; and having cut down the
sprit-sail-yard, and the mizen-yard, and every thing
I could to make a large raft, I loaded it with all
D 2
those heavy goods, and came away. But my good
luck began to leave me, for this raft was so unwieldy,
and so overladen, that after I was entered the little
cove, where I had landed the rest of my goods,
not being able to guide it so handily as I did the
other, it overset, and threw me and all any cargo
into the water. As for myself, it was no great harm,
for I was near the shore ; but as to my cargo it wag
great part of it lost, especially the iron, which I ex-
pected would have been of great use to me. IIow-
ever, when the tide was out, I got most of the pieces
of cable ashore, and some of the iron, though with
innite labour, for I was fain to dip for it into the
water, a work which fatigued me very much. After
this, I went every day on board, and brought away
what I could get.
I had been now thirteen days on shore, and had been
eleven times on board the ship, in which time I had
brought away all that one pair of hands could well
be supposed capable to bring, though I believe verily,
had the calm weather held, I should have brought
away the whole ship, piece by piece. But preparing
the twelfth ti-me to go on board, I found the wind
began to rise: however, at low water, I went on
board; and though I thought I had rummaged the
cabin so effectually, as that nothing more could be
found, yet I discovered a locker, with drawers in it,
in one of which I found two or three razors, and
one pair of large seissars, with ten or a dozen good
knives and forks; in another, I found about thirty-
six pounds value in money, some European coin,
some Brasil, some pieces of eight, some gold, some
silver.
I smiled to myself at the sight of this money. ‘ O
drug !’ said I, aloud, ‘ what art thou good for? Thou
art not worth to me, no, not the taking off the
ground. One of those knives is worth all this heap.
I have no manner of use for thee: even remain where
thou art, and go to the bottom as a creature whose
life is not worth saving!’ However, upon second
‘thoughts I took it away, and wrapping all this in a
piece of canvas, I began to think of making another
raft ; but while I was preparing this, I found the sky
overcast, and the wind began to rise, and in a quar-
ter of an hour it blew a fresh gale from the shore;
it presently occurred to me, that it was in vain to
pretend to make a raft, with the wind o" shore, and
that it was my business to be gone before the tide
of flood began, otherwise I might not be able to
reach the shorc- at all: accordingly I let myself
down into the water, and swam cross the channel,
which lay between the ship and the sand, and even
that with dillieulty enough, partly with the weight
of the things I had about me, and partly the rough-
ness of the water, for the wind rose very hastily,
and before it was quite high water, it blew a storm.
But I was gotten home to my little tent, where I
lay with all my wealth about me very secure: it
blew very hard all that night; and in the morning,
when I looked out, behold, no more ship was to be
seen ! I was a little surprised, but recovered myself
with this satisfactory reection ; viz. that I had lost
no time, nor abated any diligence, to get every thing
out of her that could be useful to me; and that
indeed there was little left in her that I was able to
bring away, if I had had more time. I now gave
over any more thought of the ship, or of any thing
out of her, except what might drive on shore from
her wreck, as indeed divers pieces of her afterwards
did; but those things were of small use to me.
My thoughts were now wholly employed about
securing myself against either savages, if any should
appear, or wild beasts, if any were in the island;
and I had many thoughts of the method how to do
this, and what kind of dwelling to make; whether
I should make me a cave in the earth, or a tent
upon the earth : and, in short, I resolved upon
both; the manner and description of which it may
not be improper to give an account of. “
I soon found the place I was in was not for my
settlement, particularly because it was upon a low
moorish ground near the sea, and I believed would
not be wholesome, and more particularly because there
was no fresh water near it; so I resolved to nd a
more healthy and more convenient spot of ground.
I consulted several things in my situation, which
I found would be proper for me; rst, Health, and
fresh water, as I just now mentioned; secondly,
Shelter from the heat.of the sun; thirdly, Security
from ravenous creatures, whether man or beast;
fourthly, A view to the sea, that if God sent any
ship in sight, I might not lose any advantage for my
deliverance, for which I was not willing to banish
all my expectation yet. ‘
In search of a place proper for this, I found a
little plain on the side of a rising hill, whose front
towards this little plain, was as steep as a house-
side, so that nothing could come down upon me
from the top. On the side of this rock there was
a hollow place, worn a little way in, like the en~
trance or door of a cave, but there was not really
any cave»or way into the rock at all.
On the llat of the green, just before this hollow
place, I resolved to pitch my tent. This plain was
not above a hundred yards broad, and about twice
as long, and lay like a green before my door, and at
the end of it descended irregularly every way down
into the low grounds by the sea-side. It was on the
N.N.W. side of the hill, so that it was sheltered
from the heat every day, till it came to a W. and by
S. sun, or thereabouts, which in those countries is
near the setting.
Before I set up my tent, I drew a half-circle be-
fore the hollow place, which took in about ten yards
in its semi-diameter, from the rock, and twenty yards
in its diameter, from its beginning and ending.
In this half-circle I pitched two rows of strong
stakes, driving them into the ground till they stood
very lirm like piles, the biggest end being out of the
ground about ve feet and a half, and sharpened
on the top; the two rows did not stand above six
inches from one another.
Then I took the pieces of cable which I had cut
in the ship, and laid them in rows upon one another,
within the circle between these two rows of stakes,
up to the top, placing other stakes in the inside,
leaning against them, about two feet and a half
high, like a spur to a post; and this fence was so
strong, that neither man nor beast could get into it,
or over it. This cost me a great deal of time and
labour, especially to out the piles in the woods, bring
them to the place, and drive them into the earth.
The entrance into this place I made to be, not by
a door, but by a short ladder, to go over the top;
which ladder, when I was in, I lifted over after me;
and so I was completely fenced in, and fortied, as
I thought, from all the world, and consequently
slept secure in the night, which otherwise 1 could
not have done; though, as it appeared afterwards,
there was no need of all this caution from the ene-
mies I apprehended danger from.
Into this fence. or fortress, with innite labour, I
carried all my riches, all my provisions, ammunition,
and stores, of which you have the account above;
and I made me a large tent also,whicb, to preserve me
from the rains, that in one part of the year are very
violent there, I made double, viz. one smaller tent
within, and one larger tent above it; and covered
the uppermost with a large tarpaulin, which I had
saved among the sails. . ‘
And now I lay no more for awhile in the bed
which I had brought on shore, but in a hammock,
which was indeed a very good one, and belonged to
the mate of the ship.
Into this tent I brought all my provisions, and
every thing that would spoil by the wet; and having
thus enclosed all my goods, I made up the entrance,
which till now I had left open, and so passed and
repassed, as I said, by a short ladder.
When I had done this, I began to work my way
into the rock, and bringing all the earth and stones
that I dug down, out through my tent, I laid them
up within my fence in the nature of a terrace, so
that it raised the ground within about a foot and
a half; and thus I made me a eavejust behind my
tent, which served me like a cellar tc my house.
It cost me much labour, and many days, before
all these things were brought to perfection; and
therefore I must go back to some other things
which took up some of my thoughts. At the same
time it happened, after I had laid my scheme for
the setting up my tent, and making the cave, that
a storm of rain falling from a thick dark cloud, a
sudden ash of lightning happened, and after that,
a great clap of thunder, as is naturally the effect of
it. I was not so much surprised with the lightning,
as I was with the thought which darted into my
mind as swift as the lightning itself: O my powder!
my very heart sunk within me, when I thought, that
at one blast all my powder might be destroyed; on
which, not my defence only, but the providing me
food, as I thought, entirely depended; I was no-
thing near so anxious about my own danger; though,
had the powder took re, I had never known who
had hurt me.
Such impression did this make upon me, that after
the storm was over, I laid aside all my works, my
building and fortifying, and applied myself to make
bags and boxes to separate my powder, and to keep
it a little and a little in a parcel, in hopes, that,
whatever might come, it might not all take re at
once, and to keep it so apart, that it should not be
possible to make one part re another. I nished
this work in about a fortnight, and I think my
powder, which in all was about 1401b. weight was
divided into no less than a hundred parcels. As
to the barrel that had been wet, I did not appre-
hend any danger from that, so I placed it in my
new cave, which in my fancy I called my kitchen;
and the rest I hid up and down in holes among the
rocks, so that no wet might come to it, marking very
carefully where I laid it.
In the interval -of time while this was doing, I
went out at least once every day with my gun, as
well to divert myself, as to see if I could kill any
thing t for food, and, as near as I could, to acquaint
myself with what the island produced. The rst
time I went out, I presently discovered, that there
were goats in the island, which was a great satis~
faction to me; but then it was attended with this
misfortune to me, viz. that they were so shy, so sub-
tle, and so swift of foot, that it was the diflicultest
thing in the world to come at them; but I was not
discouraged at this, not doubting but I might now
and then shoot one, as it soon happened; for after
I had found their haunts a little, I laid wait in this
manner for them : I observed, if they saw me in the
valleys, though they were upon the rocks, they
would run away as in a terrible fright; but if they
were feeding in the valleys, and I was upon the
rocks, they took no notice of me; from whence I
concluded, that by the position of their optics, their
sight was so directed downward, that they did not
readily see objects that were above them. So after-
wards I took this method, I always climbed the
rocks rst, to get above them, and then had fre-
quently a fair mark. The rst shot I made among
these creatures, I killed a she-goat which had a little
kid by her, which she gave suck to, which grieved
me heartily; but when the old one fell, the kid
stood stock-still by her till I came and took her up;
and not only so, but when I carried the old one
with me upon my shoulders, the kid followed me
quite to my enclosure; ~upon which I laid down the
dam, and took the kid in my arms, and carried it
over my pale, in hopes to have bred it up tame; but
it would not eat; so I was forced to kill it, and eat
it myself. These two supplied me with esh a great
while; for I eat sparingly, and saved my provisions
(my bread especially) as much as possibly I could.
I
Having now xed my habitation, I found it abso-
lutely necessary to provide a place to make a re in,
and fuel to burn ; and what I did for that, as also
how I enlarged my cave, and what conveniencies I
made, I shall give a full account of in its place: but
I must rst give some little account of myself, and
of my thoughts about living, which it may well be
supposed were not a few.
I had a dismal prospect of my condition; for as I
was not cast away upon that island without being
driven, as is said, by a violent storm quite, out of
the course of our intended voyage, and a great way,
viz. some hundreds of leagues, out of the ordinary
course of the trade of mankind, I had great reason
to consider it as a determination of I-Ieaven, that in
this desolate place, and in this desolate manner, I
should end my life. The tears would run plenti+
fully down my face, when I made these reections ;
and sometimes VI would expostulate with myself,
Why Providence should thus completely ruin its
creatures, and render them so absolutely miserable,
so without help abandoned, and so entirely de-
pressed, that it could hardly be rational to be
thankful for such a life?
But something always returned swift upon me to
check these thoughts, and to reprove me; and par-
ticularly one day, walking with my gun in my hand
by the sea-side, I was very pensive up‘on the subject
of my present condition, when reason, as it were,
put in, expostulating with me the other way, thus:
Well, you are in a desolate condition, it is true, but
pray remember, where are the rest of you ? Did not
you come eleven of you into the boat? where are
the ten»? why were not they saved, and you lost?
why were you singled out ? is it better to be here or
there? And then I pointed to the sea. All evils
are to be considered with the good that is in them,
and with what worse attended them. '
Then it occurred to me again, how well I was
furnished for my subsistence, and what would have
J
been my case, if it had not happened, which was an
hundred thousand to one, that the ship oated from
the place where she rst struck, and was driven so
near to the shore, that 1 had time to get all these
things out of her ? What would have been my case,
if I had been to have lived in the condition in which
I at rst came on shore, without necessaries of life,
or any means to supply and procure them? Parti-
cularly, said I aloud (though to myself), what would
I have done without a gun, without ammunition,
without any tools to make any thing, or to work
with ? without clothes, bedding, a tent, or any man-
ner of coverings? And that now I had all these to
a sufficient quantity, and was in a fair way to pro-
vide myself in such a manner, as to live without my
gun when my ammunition was spent, so that I had
a tolerable view of subsisting without any want as
long as I lived; for I considered from the beginning
how I would provide for the accidents that might
happen, and for the time that was to come, even "not
onlyafter my ammunition should be spent, but even
after my health or strength should decay.
I confess I had not then entertained any notion
of my ammunition being destroyed at one blast, I
mean my powder being blown up by lightning; and
this made the thoughts of it so surprising to me, when
it lightened and thundered, as I observed just now.
And now, being to enter into a melancholy rela-
tion of a scene of silent life, such perhaps as was
never heard of in the world before, I shall take it
from its beginning, and continue it in its order. It
was, by my account, the 30th of September, when,
in the manner as abovesaid, I ~rst set foot upon
this horrid island, when the sun being, to us, in its
autumnal equinox, was almost just over my head;
for I reckoned myself, by observation, to be in the
latitude of 9 degrees, Q2 minutes north of the line.
After I had been there about ten or twelve days,
it came into my thoughts, that I should lose my
reckoning of time for want of books, and pen and
ink, and should even forget the sabbath days from
the working days : but to prevent this, I cut it with
my knife upon a large post, in capital letters ; and,
making it into a great cross, I set it up on the shore
where I rst landed, viz. I came on shore here the
30th‘ of Sept. 1659. Upon the sides of this square
post‘ l cut every day a notch with my knife, and
every seventh notch was as long again as the rest.
and every rst day of the month as long again as
that long one; and thus I kept my calendar, or
weekly, monthly, and yearly reckoning of time.
In the next place we are to observe, that among
the many things which I brought off the ship in the
several voyages, which, as above—mentioned, I made
to it, I got several things of less value, but not at
all less useful to me, which I omitted setting down
before; as in particular, pens, ink, and paper, seve-
ral parcels in the captain’s, mate's, gunner‘s, and
carpenter’s keeping, three or four compasses, some
mathematicalinstruments, dials, perspectives, charts,
and books of navigation, all which I huddled to~
gether, whether I might want them or no; also I
found three very good Bibles, which came to me in
my cargo from England, and which I had packed up
among my things; some Portuguese books also, and
among them two or three popish prayer-books, and
several other books, all which I carefully secured.
And I must not forget that we had in the ship a
dog and two cats, of whose eminent history I may
have occasion to say something in its place; for I
carried both the cats with me; and as for the dog,
he jumped out of the ship of himself, and swam on
shore to me the day after I Went on shore with my
rst cargo, and was a trusty servant to me many
years; I wanted nothing that he could fetch me,
nor any company that he could make up to me; I
only wanted to have him talk to me, but that he
could not do. As I observed before, I found pen,
ink, and paper, and I husbanded them to the ut-
most ; and I shall show, that while my ink lasted, I
-
1
kept things very exact; but after that was gone, I
could not; for I could not make any ink, by any
means that I could devise.
And this put me in mind that I wanted many
things, notwithstanding all that I had amassed toge-
ther; and of these, this of ink was one, as also a
spade, pick-axe, and shovel, to dig or remove the
earth; needles, pins, and thread; as for linen, I soon
learned to want that without much diiculty.
This want of tools made every work I did go on
heavily, and it was near a whole year before I had
entirely nished my little pale, or surrounded habit-
ation: the piles, or stakes, which were as heavy as I
could well lift, were a long time in cutting and pre-
paring in the woods, and more by far in bringing
home ; so that I spent sometimes two days in cutting
and bringing home one of those posts, and a third
day in driving it into the ground ; for which purpose
I got a heavy piece of wood at rst, but at last
bethought myself of one of the iron crows, which
however, though I found it, yet made driving those
posts or piles very laborious and tedious work.
But what need I have been concerned at the
tediousness of any thing I had to do, seeing I had
time enough to do it in? Nor had I any other em-
ployment, if that had been over, at least, that I
could foresee, except the ranging the island to seek
for food, which I did more or less every day.
I now began to consider seriously my condition,
and the circumstance I was reduced to, and I drew
up the state of my alfairs in writing; not so much
to leave them to any that were to come after me,
for I was like to have but few heirs, as to deliver
my thoughts from daily poring upon them, and
afflicting my mind; and as my reason began now
to master my despondency, I began to comfort my-
self as well as I could, and to set the good against
the evil, that I might have something to distinguish
my case from worse; and I stated it very imparti-
ally,like debtor and creditor, the comforts Ienjoyecl,
against the miseries I suffered, thus:
EVIL.
I am cast upon a hor-
rible desolate island,v0id
of all hope of recovery.
I am singled out, and
separated, as it were,
from all the world, to
be miserable.
I am divided from man-
kind, a solitary, one ba-
nished from human so-
ciety.
I have no clothes to
cover me.
I am without any de-
fence or means to resist
any violence of man or
beast.
I have no soul to speak
to, or relieve me.
GOOD.
'But I am alive, and
not drowned, as all my
ship’s company was.
But I am singled out
too, from all the ship’s
crew, to be spared from
death; and he that mira-
culously saved me from
death, can deliver me
from this condition.
But I am not starved,
and perishing on a bar-
ren place, affording no
sustenance.
But I am in a hot cli-
mate, whcre, if I had
clothes, I could hardly
wear them.
But I am cast on an
island where I see no
wild beasts to hurt me,
as I saw on the coast of
Africa: and what, if I
had been shipwrecked
there?
But God wonderfully
sent the ship in near
enough to the shore, that
I have gotten out so many
necessary things as will
either supply my wants,
or enable me to supply
myself, even as long as
I live.
.4
Upon the whole, here was an undoubted testi-
mony, that there was scarce any condition in the
world so miserable, but there was something nega-
tive, or something positive, to be thankful for in it;
and let this stand as a direction from the experience of
the most miserable of all conditions in this world,
that we may always nd in it something to comfort
ourselves from, and to set, in the description of
good and evil, on the credit-side of the accompt.
Having now brought my mind a little to relish
my condition, and giving over looking out to sea, to
see if I could spy a ship; I say, giving over those
things, I began to apply myself to accommodate my
way of living, and to make things as easy to me as
I could.
I have already described my habitation, which
was a tent under the side of a rock, surrounded
with a strong pale of posts and cables, but I might
now rather call it a wall ; for I raised a kind of wall
up against it of turfs, about two feet thick on the
outside; and after some time (I think it was a year
and a half) I raised rafters from it, leaning to the
the rock, and thatched or covered it with boughs of
trees, and such things as I could get to keep out
the rain, which I found at some times of the year
very violent.
I have already observed how I brought all my
goods into this pale, and into the cave which l had
made behind me; but I must observe too, that, at
rst, this was a confused heap of goods, which, as
they lay in no order, so they took up all my place:
I had no room to turn myself, so I set myself to
enlarge my cave, and worked farther into the earth;
for it was a loose sandy rock, which yielded easily
to the labour I bestowed on it: and so, when I found
I was pretty safe as to beasts of prey, I worked side-
ways to the right hand into the rock; and, then
turning to the right again, worked quite out, and
made me a door to come out on the outside of my
pale or fortication. _
This gave me not only egress and regress, as it
was a back-way to my tent, and to my store-house,
but gave me room to stow my goods.
And now I began to apply myself to make such
necessary things as I found I most wanted, particu-
larly a chair and a table; for without these I was
not able to enjoy the few comforts I had in the
world; I could not write or eat, or several things,
with so much pleasure without a table.
So 1 went to work; and here I must needs ob-
serve, that as reason is the substance and original
of the mathematics, so by stating and squaring every
thing by reason, and by making the most rational
judgement of things, every man may be, in time,
master of every mechanic art. I had never handled
a tool in my life, and yet, in time, by labour, appli-
cation, and contrivance, I found, at last, that I
wanted nothing but I could have made it, especially
if I had had tools; however, I made abundance of
things, even without tbols, and some with no more
tools than an adz and a hatchet, which perhaps were
never made that way before, and that with innite
labour.’ For example, if I wanted a board, I had
no other way but to cut down a tree, set it on an
edge before me, and hew it flat on either side with
my ax, till I had brought it to be as thin as a plank,
and then dub it smooth with my adz. It is true, by
this method I could make but one board out of a
whole tree, but this I had no remedy for, but pa-
tience, any more than I had for the prodigious deal
of time and labour which it took me up to make a
-plank or board: but my time or labour was little
worth, and so it was as well employed one way as
another.
However, I made me a table and a chair, as I ob-
served above, in the rst place, and this I did out of
the short pieces of boards that I brought on my
raft from the ship; but when I had wrought out
some boards, as above, I made large shelves of the
breadth of a foot and a half, one over another, all
along one side of my cave, to lay all my tools, nails,
and iron~work, and, in a word, to separate every
thing at large in their places, that I might easily
come at them : also, I knocked pieces into the wall
of the rock to hang my guns, and all things that
would hang up.
So that, had my cave been to be seen, it looked
like a general magazine of all necessary things ; and
I had every thing so ready at my hand, that it was a
great pleasure to me to see all my goods in such
order, and especially to nd my stock of all neces-
saries so great.
And now it was when I began to keep a journal
of every day’s employment; for indeed at rst I
was in too much hurry, and not only a hurry as to
labour, but in too much discomposure of mind, and
my journal would have been full of many dull
things. For example, I must have said thus: Sep-
tember the 30th, After I got to ‘shore, and had es-
caped drowning, instead of being thankful to God
for my deliverance, having rst vomited with the
great quantity of saltwater which was gotten into my
stomach, and recovering myself a little, I ran about
the shore, wringing my hands, and beating my head
and face, exclaiming at my misery, and crying out,
I was undone ! undone! till, tired and faint, I was
forced to lie down on the ground to repose, but
durst not sleep for fear of being devoured.
Some days after this, and after I had been on
board the ship, and had got all I could out of her,
yet I could not forbear getting up to the top of a
little mountain, and looking out to sea, in hopes of
seeing a ship, then fancy, at a vast distance, I spied
a sail, please myself with the hopes of it, and then,
after looking steadily, till I was almost blind, lose
it quite, and sit down and weep like a child, and
thus increase my misery by my folly.
But having gotten over these things, in some
measure, and having settled my household-stu‘
and habitation, made me a table and a chair, and
all as handsome about me as I could. I began, Isay,
to keep my journal, of which I shall here give you
the copy (though in it will be told all these particu-
lars over again), as long as it lasted ; for at last hav-
ing no more ink, I was forced to leave it off.
THE JOURNAL.
SEPTEMBER 30, 1659. I, poor miserable Ro-
binson Crusoe, being shipwrecked during a dread-
ful storm in the ofng, came on shore on this dismal
unfortunate island, which I called the Island of
Despair, all the rest of the ship's company being
drowned, and myself almost dead.
All the rest of the day I spent in aiicting myself
at the dismal circumstances I was brought to, viz.
I had neither food, house, clothes, weapon, or place
to y to, and in despair of any relief, saw nothing
but death before me, either that I should be dc-
voured by wild beasts, murdered by savages, or
starved to death for want of food. At the approach
of night, I slept in a tree, for fear of wild creatures;
but slept soundly, though it rained all night.
October 1. In the morning I saw, to my great
surprise, the ship had oated with the high tide, and
was driven on shore again much nearer the island,
which, as it was some comfort on one hand (for sec-
ing her sit upright, and not broken in pieces, l
hoped, if the wind abated, I might get on hoard,
and get some food and necessaries out of her for
my relief), so, on the other hand, it renewed my
grief at the loss of my comrades, who, I imagined,
if we had all staid on board, might have saved the
ship, or at least that they would not have been all
drowned, as they wero; and that, had the men been
saved, we might perhaps have built us a boat out of
the ruins of the ship, to have carried us to some
other part of the world. I spent great part of this
(lay in perplexing myself on these things; but at
length seeing the ship almost dry, I went upon the
sand as near as I cotfld. and then swam on board.
This day also continued raining, though with no
wind at all.
From the 1st of October to the 24th. All these
days entirely spent in making several voyages to get
all I could out of the ship, which I brought on
shore every tide of flood upon rafts. Much rain
also in these days, though with some intervals of
fair weather; but, it seems, this was the rainy sea-
son. g
October Q4. I overset my raft, and all the goods
I had got upon it; but being in shoal water, and the
things being chiey heavy, I recovered many of them
when the tide was out.
October £25. It rained all night, and all day,
with some gusts of wind, during which time the
ship broke in pieces, the wind blowing a little
harder than before, and was no more to be seen,
except the wreck of her, and that only at low
water. I spent this day in covering and securing
the goods which I saved, that the rain might not
spoil them.
October 26. I walked about the shore almost all
day to nd out a place to x my habitation, greatly
concerned to secure myself from any attack, in the
night, either from wild beasts or men. Towards
night I xed upon a proper place under a rock, and
marked out a semicircle for my encampment, which
I resolved to strengthen with a work, wall, or forti-
cation, made of double piles, lined within with
cable, and without with turf.
From the 26th to the 30th, I worked very hard
in carrying all my goods to my new habitation,
though some part of the time it rainedexceeding
hard.
The 31st, in the morning, I went out into the
island with my gun, to see for some food, and dis-
cover the country; when I killed a she-goat, and her
E
kid followed me home, which I afterwards killed
also, because it would not feed.
November 1. I set up my tent under a rock, and
lay there for the rst night, making it as large as I
could, with stakes driven in to swing my hammock
upon.
November Q. I set up all my chests and boards,
and the pieces of timber which made my rafts, and
with them formed a fence round me, a little within
the place I had marked out for my fortication.
November 3. I went out with my gun, and
killed two fowls like ducks, which were very good
food. In the afternoon, went to work to make me
a table.
November 4, This morning I began to order my
times of work, of going out with my gun, time of
sleep, and time of diversion; viz. every morning I
walked out with my gun, for two or three hours, if
it did not rain; then employed myself to work till
about eleven o'clock ; then eat what I had to live
on; and, from twelve to two, I lay down to sleep,
the weather being excessive hot, and then in the
evening to work again. The working part of this
day and the next were wholly employed in making
my table, for I was yet but a very sorry workman,
though time and necessity made me a complete na-
tural -mechanic soon after, as I believe it would do
any one else.
November 5. This day I went abroad with my
gun and my dog, and killed a wild cat; her skin
pretty soft, but her esh good for nothing. Every
creature I killed, I took off the skins and preserved
them. Coming back, by the sea-shore, 1 saw many
sorts of sea-fowls which I did not understand; but
was surprised, and almost frighted, with two or
three seals, which, while I was gazing at, not well
knowing what they were, got into the sea, and
escaped me for that time.
November 6. After my morning walk, I went to
work with my table again, and nished it, though
not to my liking; nor was it long before I learned
to mend it.
November 7. Now it began to be settled fair
weather. The 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th, and part of the
12th (for the 11th was Sunday, according to my
reckoning), I took wholly up to make me a chair,
and, with much ado, brought it to a tolerable shape,
but never to please me; and even in the making I
pulled it to pieces several times. Note, I soon ne-
glected keeping my Sundays; for, omitting my mark
for them on my post, I forgot which was which.
November 13. This day it rained, which re-
freshed me exceedingly, and cooled the earth; but
it was accompanied with terrible thunder and light-
ning, which frighted me dreadfully, for fear of my
powder. As soon as it was over, I resolved to
separate my stock of powder into as many little par-
cels as possible, that it might not be in danger.
November 14~, 15, 16. These three days I spent
in making little square chests or boxes, which might
hold about a pound, or two pounds at most, of pow-
der; and so putting the powder in, I stowed it in
places as secure and remote from one another as
possible. On one of these three days 1 killed a_
large bird that was good to eat, but I knew not
what to call it.
November 17. This day I began to dig behind
my tent into the rock, to make room for my farther
conveniency. Note, Three things I wanted exceed-
ingly for this work; viz. a pickaxe,_ a shovel, and a
wheelbarrow or basket: so I desisted from my
work, and began to consider how to supply that
want, and make me some tools. As for the pick-.
axe, I made'use of the iron crows, which were
proper enough, though heavy; but the next thing
was a shovel or spade; this was so absolutely_ ne-
cessary, that indeed I could do nothing effectually
without it; but what kind of one to make, I knew
not.
November 18. The next day, in searching the
woods, I found a tree of that wood, or like it,
which, in the Brasils, they call the iron-tree, for its
exceeding hardness: of this, with great labour, and
almost spoiling my axe, I cut a piece, and brought it
home too with difculty enough, for it was exceed-
ing heavy.
The excessive hardness of the wood, and having
no other way, made me a long while upon this ma-
chine; for-I worked it elfeetually, by little and
little, into the form of a shovel or spade, the handle
exactly shaped like ours in England, only that the
broad part having no iron shod upon it at bottom,
it would not last mo so long: however, it served
well enough for the uses which 1 had occasion to
put it to; but never was a shovel, I believe, made
after that fashion, or so long a making.
I was still deficient, for I wanted a basket, or a
wheelbarrow: a basket I could not make by any
means, having no such things as twigs that would
bend to make wicker-ware, or at least none yet found
out; and, as to the wheelbarrow, I fancied I could
make all but the wheel; but that I had no notion of,
neither did I know how to go about it: besides, I
had no possible way to make iron gudgeons, for the
spindle or axis of the wheel to run in, so I gave it
over; and so, for carrying away the earth which I
dug out of the cave, I made me a thing like a hod,
which the labourers carry mortar in, when they serve
the bricklayers.
This was not so difficult to me as the making the
shovel; and yet this, and the shovel, and the at-
tempt which I made in vain to make a wheel-
barrow, took me up no less than four days : I mean,
always excepting my morning walk with my gun,
which I seldom failed, and very seldom failed also
of bringing home something t to eat.
November 23. My other work having stood still,
because of my making these tools, when they were
nished I went on ; and, working every day as my
strength and time allowed, I spent eighteen days
entirely in widening and deepening my cave, that it
might hold my goods commodiously.
Note, During all this time, I worked to make this
room, or cave, spacious enough to accommodate me
as a warehouse or magazine, a kitchen, a dining-
room, and a cellar; as for a lodging, I kept to the
tent, except that sometimes in the wet season of
the year it rained so hard, that I could not keep
myself dry; which caused me afterwards to cover
all my place within my pale, with long poles, in the
form of rafters, leaning against the rock, and load
them with ags, and large leaves of trees, like a
thatch.
December 10. I began now to think my cave or
vault nished, when, on a sudden (it seems I had
made it too large), a great quantity of earth fell
down from the top and one side, so much that, in
short, it frighted me, and not without reason too ;
for if I had been under it, I had never wanted a
grave-digger. Upon this disaster, I had a great
deal of work to do over again; for I had the loose
earth to carry out, and, which was of more import-
ance, I had the cieling to prop up, so that I might
be sure no more would come down.
December 11. This day I went to work with it
accordingly, and got two shores, or posts, pitched
upright to the top, with two pieces of boards across
over each post. This I nished the next day; and
setting more posts up with boards, in about a week
more I had the roof secured; and the posts, stand-
ing in rows, served me for partitions to part off my
house.
December 17. From this day to the 20th, I
placed shelves, and knocked up nails on the posts,
to hang every thing up that could be hung up;
and now I began to be in some order within
doors.
December 20. Now I carried every thing into
the cave, and began to furnish my house, and set up
some pieces of boards, like a dresser, to order my
victuals upon ; but boards began to be very scarce
with me. Also I made me another table.
December 24-. Much rain all night and all day:
no stirring out.
December 25. Rain all day.
December 26. No rain, and the earth much cooler
than before, and pleasanter.
December 27. °Killed a young goat, and lamed
another, so that I catched it, and led it home in a
string; when I had it home I bound and splintered
up its leg, which was broke. N. B. I took such
care of it, that it lived, and the leg grew well, and
as strong as ever; but by nursing it so long it grew
tame, and fed upon the little green at my door, and
would not go away. This was the rst time that I
entertained a thought of breeding up some tame crea-
tures, that I might have food when my powder and
shot was all spent.
December 28, 29, 30. Great heats and no breeze ;
so that there was no stirring abroad, except in the
evening for food. This time I spent in putting all
my things in order within doors.
January '1. ,Very hot still; but I went abroad,
early and late, with my gun, and lay still in the
middle of the _day. This evening, going farther
into the valleys, which lay to the centre of the
island, I found there was plenty of goats, though
exceeding shy, and hard to come at; however, I
resolved to try if I could not bring my dog to hunt
them down.
January 2. Accordingly, the next day, I went
out with my dog, and set him upon the goats ; but I
was mistaken, for they all faced about upon the dog,
and he knew his danger too well, for he would not
come near them.
. January 3. I began my fence or wall, which,
being still jealous of my being attacked by some-
body, I resolved to make very thick and strong.
[N. B. This wall being described before, I pur-
posely omit what was said in the journal: it is suf-
cient to observe, that I was no less time than from
the 3d of January to the 14-th of April, working,
nishing, and perfecting this wall, though it was no
more than about twenty-four yards in length, being
a half circle, from one place in the rock, to another
place about eight yards from it, the door of the cave
being in the centre behind it.]
All this time I worked very hard, the rains hin-
dering me many days, nay, sometimes, weeks to-
gether; but I thought I should never be perfectly
secure till this wall was nished: and it is scarce
credible what inexpressible labour every thing was
done with, especially the bringing piles out of the
woods, and driving them into the ground; for I
made them much bigger than I needed to have
done.
When this wall was nished, and the outside
double fenced, with a turf-wall raised up close to
it, I persuaded myself, that if any people were to
come on shore there, they would not perceive any
thing like a habitation: and it was very well I did
so, as may be observed hereafter, upon a very re-
markable occasion.
During this time, I made my rounds in the woods
for game every day, when the rain admitted me, and
made frequent discoveries in these walks of some-
thing or other to my advantage; particularly I
found a kind of wild pigeons, which build not as
wood-pigeons in a tree, but rather as house-pigeons,
in the holes of the rocks; and taking some young
ones, I endeavoured to breed them up tame, and
did so; but when they grew older, they ew all
a-way, which perhaps was at rst for want of feeding
them, for I had nothing to give them: however, I
frequently found their nests, and got their young
ones, which were very good meat.
And now, in the managing my household affairs, I
found myself wanting in many things, which I
thought at rst it was impossible for me to make, as
indeed as to some of them it was: for instance, I
could never make a cask to be hooped. I had a
small runlet or two, as I observed before, but I
could never arrive to the capacity of making one by
them, though I spent many weeks about it; I could
neither put in the heads, or join-the staves so true
to one another, as to make them hold water; so I
gave that also over. -
In the next place, I was at a great loss for can-
dies; so that as soon as it was dark, which was ge-
nerally by scven o’clock, I was obliged to go to bed.
I remembered the lump of bees-wax, with which I
made candles in my African adventure; but I had
none of that now: the only remedy I had, was, that
when I had killed a goat, I saved the tallow, and
with a little dish made of clay, which I baked in
the sun, to which I added a wick of seine oakum,
I made me a lamp: and this gave me light, though
not a clear steady light, like a candle. In the mid-
dle of all my labours it happened that, rummag-
ing my things, I found a little bag, which, as I
hinted before, had been lled with corn, for the
feeding of poultry, not for this voyage, but before,
as I suppose, when the ship came from Lisbon:
what little remainder of corn had been in the bag,
was all devoured by the rats, and I saw nothing in
the bag but husks and dust; and being willing to
have the bag for some other use (I think it was to
put powder in, when I divided it for fear of the
lightning, or some such use), I shook the husks oi
corn out of it, on one side of my fortication, under
the rock.
It was a little before the great rains, just now
mentioned, that I threw this stuff away, taking no
notice of any thing, and not so much as remember-
ing that I had thrown any thing there; when, about
a month after, or thereabouts, I saw some few stalks
of something green shooting up on the ground,
which I fancied might be some plant I had not
seen; but I was surprised, and perfectly astonished,
when, after a little longer time, I saw about ten or
\
twelve ears come out, which were perfect green bar‘
ley, of the same kind as our European, nay, as our
English barley.
It is impossible to express the astonishment and
confusion of my thoughts on this occasion: I had.
hitherto acted upon no religious foundation at all;
indeed I had very few notions of religion in my
head, nor had entertained any sense of any thing
that had befallen me, otherwise than as a‘ chance,
or, as we lightly say, what pleases God ; without so
much as inquiring into the end of Providence in
these things, or his order in governing events in
the world: but, after I saw barley grow there, in a
climate which I knew was not proper for corn, and
especially that I knew not how it came there, it
startled me strangely, and I began to suggest, that
God had miraculously caused this grain to grow,
without any help of seed sown, and that it was so
directed purely for my sustenance in that wild mi-
serable place.
This touched my heart a little, and brought tears
out of my eyes, and I began to bless myself, that
such a prodigy of nature should happen upon my
account; and this was the more strange to me, be-
cause I saw near it still, all along by the side of the
rock, some other straggling stalks, which proved to
be stalks of rice, and which I knew, because I had
seen it grow in Africa, when I was ashore there.
I not only thought these the pure productions of
Providence for my support; but,. not doubting but
that there was more in the place, I went all over
that part of the island where I had been before,
peering in every porner, and under every rock, to
see for more of it, but I could not nd any; at last
it occurred to my thoughts, that I had shaken the
bag of chieke-n’s meat out in that place, and then the
wonder began to cease ; and I must confess, my re-
ligious thankfulness to ,God’s providence began to
abate too, upon the discovering that all this was
nothing but what was common, though 1 ought to
E 2
have been as thankful for so strange and unforeseen
Providence, as if it had been miraculous ; for it was
really the work of Providence as to me, that should
order or appoint, that ten or twelve grains of corn
should remain unspoiled (when the rats had de-
stroyed all the rest), as if it had been dropped from
heaven: as also that I should throw it out in that
particular place, where, it being in the shade of a
high rock, it sprang up immediately, whereas, if I
had thrown it any where else, at that time, it had
been burnt up and destroyed.
I carefully saved the ears of this corn, you may be
sure, in their season, which was about the end of
June; a.nd laying up every corn, I resolved to sow
them all again, hoping in time to have some quantity
suicient to supply me with bread; but it was not
till the fourth year that I would allow myself the
least grain of this corn to eat, and even then but
sparingly, as I shall say afterwards in its order; for
I lost all that I sowed the rst season, by not ob~
serving the proper time, for I sowed it just before
the dry season, so that it never came up at all, at
least, not as it would have done: of which, in its
place.
Besides this barley, there were, as above, twenty
or thirty stalks of rice, which I preserved with the
same care, and whose use was of the same kind, or
to the same purpose; viz. to make me bread, or
rather food ; for I found ways to cook it up without
baking, though I did that also, after some time. But
to return to my journal.
I worked excessive hard these three or four
months, to get my wall done; and,- the 14th of
April, I closedit up, contriving to go into it, not
by a door, but over the wall, by a ladder, that there
might be no sign on the outside of my habitation.
April 16. I nished the ladder: so I went up
with the ladder to the top, and then pulled it up
after me, and let it down on the inside. This was
a complete enclosure to me; for within I had room
enough, and nothing could come at me from with-
out, unless it could rst mount my wall.
The very next day after this wall was nished, I
had almost had all my labour overthrown at once,
and myself killed. The case was thus: as I was
busy in the inside of it, behind my tent, just in the
entrance into my cave, I was terribly frighted with
a mostidreadful surprising thing indeed ; for, all on
a- sudden, I found the earth came tumbling down
from, the roof of my cave, and from the edge of the
hill, over my head, and two of the posts I had set
up in the cave, cracked in a frightful manner. I was
heartily seared, but thought nothing of what really
was the cause; only thinking that the top of my
cave was falling in, as some of it had done before,
and, for fear I should be buried in it, I ran forwards
to my ladder; and, not thinking myself safe there
neither, I got over my wall, for fear of the pieces of
the hill, which 1 expected might roll down upon
me. I was no sooner stepped .down upon the rm
ground, but l plainly saw it was a terrible earth-
quake; for the ground I stood on shook three
times, at about eight minutes distance, with three
such shocks as would have overturned the strongest
building that could be supposed to have stood upon
the earth; and a great piece of the top of a rock,
which stood about half a mile from me next the sea,
fell down with such a terrible noise, as I never
heard in all my life. I perceived also the very sea
was put into a violent motion by it; and, I believe,
the shocks were stronger under the water than on
the island.
I was so amazed with the thing itself, having never
felt the like, or discoursed with any one that had,
that I was like one dead or stupied; and the mo-
tion of the earth made my stomach sick, like one
that was tossed at sea; but the noise of the falling
of the rock awaked me, as it were, and, rousing me
from the stupied condition I was in, lled me with
horror, and I thought of nothing then but the hill
L
falling upon my tent, and all my household goods;
and burying all at once; and this sunk my very soul
within me a second time.
After the third shock was over, and I felt no more
for some time, I began to take courage; and yet I
had not heart enough to get over my wall again, for
fear of being buried alive; but still sat upon the
ground, greatly cast down, and disconsolate, not
knowing what to do. All this while, I had not the
least serious religious thought, nothing but the com-
mon ‘ Lord, have mercy upon me!’ and when it was
over, that went away too.
While l sat thus, I found the air overcast, and it
grew cloudy, as if it would rain; and, in less than
half an hour, it blew a most dreadful hurricane of
wind. The sea was all on a sudden covered with foam
and froth, the shore was covered with the breach of
the water, the trees were torn up by the roots, and
a terrible storm it was; and this held about three
hours, and then began to abate; and then in two
hours more it was calm, and began to rain very
hard.
All this while, I sat upon the ground, very much
terried and dejected ; when, on a sudden, it came
into my thoughts, that these winds and rain, being
the consequence of the earthquake, the earthquake
itself was spent and over, and I might venture into
my cave again. With this thought my spirits began
to revive, and the rain helping also to persuade me,
I went in, and sat me down in my tent; but the
rain was so violent, that my tent was ready to be
beaten down with it, and 1 was forced to go into
my cave, though very much afraid and uneasy, for
fear it should fall on my head.
This violent rain forced me to a new work, viz. to
cut a hole through my new fortication, like a sink,
to let the water go out, which would else have
drowned my cave. After I had been in my cave
some time, and found still no more shocks of the
earthquake follow, I began to be more composed;
and now, to support my spirits, which indeed wanted
it very much, I went to my little store, and took a
small sup of rum, which, however, I did then, and
always, very sparingly, knowing I could have no
more, when that was gone.
It continued raining all that night, and great part
of the next day, so that I could not stir abroad;
but, my mind being more composed, It began to
think of what I had best do; concluding that if
the island was subject to these earthquakes, there
would be no living for me in a cave, but I must con-
sider of building me some little hut, in an open
place, which I might surround with a wall, as I had
done here, and so make myself secure from wild
beasts or men; but concluded, if I staid where I
was, I should certainly, one time or other, be buried
alive.
With these thoughts, 1 resolved to move my tent
from the place where it stood, which was just under
the hanging precipice of the hill, and which, if it
should be shaken again, would certainly fall upon
my tent. And I spent the two next days, being the
19th and 20th of April, in contriving where and how
to remove my habitation.
The fear of being swallowed up alive, made me
that I never slept in quiet; and yet the apprehen~
sion of lying abroad, without any fence, was
almost equal to it: but still, when I looked about,
and saw how every thing was put in order, how
pleasantly concealed I was, and how safe from dan-
ger, it made me very loath to remove. r
In the mean time it occurred to me, that it would
require a vast deal of time for me to do this, and
that I must be contented to run the venture where
I was, till I had formed a camp for myself, and had
secured it so as to remove to it. So, with this reso-
lution, I composed myself for a time, and resolved
that I would go to work, with all speed, to build me
a wall, with piles and cables, &c. in a circle, as be-
fore, and set my tent up in it, when it was nished ;
but that I would venture to stay where I was, till
it was nished, and t to remove to. This was
the, 2,1st.~_ _ , V » _ ~
. April 22., The next morning I began to consider
of means to put this resolve in execution; but I
was at a great loss about my tools. I had three
large axes, and abundance of hatchets (for we car-
ried the hatchets for traffic with the Indians); but,
with much chopping and cutting knotty hard wood,
they were all full of notches, and dull ; and though
I had a grindstone, I could not turn it, and grind
my tools too. This cost me as much thought as a
statesman would have bestowed upon a grand point
of polities, or a judge upon the life and death of a
man. At length, I contrived a wheel, with a string,
to turn it‘ with my foot, that I might have both my
hands at liberty. Note, I had not seen any sueh
thing in England, or at least not to take notice how
it was done, though since I have observed, it is
very common there; besides that, my grindstone
was very large and heavy. This machine cost me a
full week’s work, to bring it to perfection.
April 28,29. These two whole days I took up in
grinding my tools; my machine for turning my grind-
stone performing very well.
April 30. Having perceived my bread had been
low a great while, I now took a survey of it, and re-I
duced myself to one biscuit-cake a day, which made
my heart very heavy.
- May 1. In the morning, looking towards the sea-
side, the tide being low, I saw something lie on the
shore, bigger than ordinary, and it looked like a
cask ; when I came to it, I found a small barrel, and
two or three pieces of the wreck of the ship, which
were driven on shore by the late hurricane; and,
looking towards the wreck itself, I thought it
seemed to lie higher out of the water than it used
to do. I examined the barrel which was driven on
shore, and soon found it was a barrel of gunpowder,
but it had taken water, and the powder was caked
as hard as a stone: however, 1 rolled it farther on
shore for the present, and went on upon the sands,
as near as I could to the wreck of the ship to look
for more.
When I came. down to the ship, I found it
strangely removed : the forecastle, which lay before
buried in the sand, was heaved up at least six feet;
and the stern, which was broken to pieces, and
parted from the rest by the force of the sea, soon
after I had left rummaging of her, was tossed, as it
were, up, and cast on one side; and the sand was
thrown so high on that side next the stern, that
whereas there was a great place of water before, so
that I could not come within a quarter of a mile of
the wreck without swimming, I could now walk
quite up to her when the tide was out. I was sur-
prised with this at rst, but soon concluded itmust
be done by the earthquake; and as by this violence
the ship was more broken open than formerly, so
many things came daily on shore, which the sea
had loosened, and which the winds and water rolled
by degrees to the land. '
This wholly diverted my thoughts from the de-
sign of removing my habitation ; and I busied my-
self mightily, that day especially, in searching whe-
ther I could make any way into the ship ; but I
found nothing was to be expected of that kind, for
that all the inside of the ship was clioaked'up with
sand. However, as I had learnt not to despair of
any thing, I resolved to pull every thing to pieces
that I could of the ship, concluding that every
thing I could get from her would be of some use or
other to me.
May 3. I began with my saw, and cut a piece of
of a beam through, which I thought held some of
the upper part, or quarter-deck, together ;' and when
I had cut it through, I cleared away the sand as well
as I could, from the side which’ lay highest: but the
tide coming in, I was obliged to give over for that
time.
May 4~. I went a shing, but caught not one sh
that I durst eat of, till 1 was weary of my sport,
\vhen, just going to leave off, I caught a young dol-
phin. 1 had made me a long line of some rope-yarn,
but I had no hooks; yet I frequently caught sh
enough, as much as I cared to eat; all which I dried
in the sun, and eat them dry.
May 5. Worked on the wreck, cut another beam
asunder, and brought three great r-planks off from
the decks, which I tied together, and made swim on
shore, when the tide» of ood came on.
May 6. Worked on the wreck, got several iron
bolts out of her, and other pieces of iron-work;
worked very hard, and came home very much tired,
and had thoughts of giving it over.
May 7. Went to the wreck again, but with an
intent not to work; but found the weight of the
wreck had broken itself down, the beams being cut,
that several pieces of the ship seemed to lie loose,
and the inside of the hold lay so open, that I could
see into it; but almost full of water and sand.
May 8. Went to the wreck, and carried an iron
crow to wrench up the deck, which lay now quite
clear of the water or sand. I wrenehed open two.
planks, and brought them on shore also with the
tide. I left the iron crow in the wreck for next
day.
May 9. Went to the wreck, and, with the crow,
made way into the body of the wreck, and felt
several casks, and loosened them with the crow;
but could not break them up. I felt also the roll
of English lead, and could stir it; but it was too
heavy to move.
May 10, 11, 12, 13, 14. Went every day to the
wreck, and got a great deal of pieces of timber, and
boards, or planks, and two or three hundred weight;
of iron. g
May 15. I carried two hatehets, to try if I could
not cut a piece off the roll of lead, by placing the
edge of one hatchet, and driving it with the other;
ROBINSON ciwson. 89
but as it lay about a foot and a half in the water, I
could not make any blow to drive the hatchet. .
May 16. It had blowed hard in the night, and
the wreck appeared more broken by the force of the
water ;. but I staid so long in the woods, to get
pigeons for food, that the tide prevented me going
to the wreck that day.
May 17. I saw some pieces of the wreck blown
on shore, at a great distance, two miles o’ me; but
resolved to see what they were, and found it was a
piece of the head; but too heavy for me to bring
away.
. May 24." Every day, to this day, I worked on
the wreck, and, with hard labour, I loosened some
things so much with the crow, that, the rst ow-
ing tide, several casks oated out, and two of the
seamen's chests; but the wind blowing from the
shore, nothing came to land that day, but pieces
of timber, and a hogshead which had some Brasil
pork in it; but the salt water and the sand had
spoiled it.
v I continued this work every day to the 15th of
June, except the time necessary to get food, which
I always appointed, during this part of my employ-
ment, ito be when the tide was up, that I might be
ready when it was ebbed out; and, by this time, I
had gotten timber and plank, and iron-work enough
to have built a good boat, if I had known how ; and
also I got at several times, and in several pieces,
near one hundred weight of the sheet-lead.
June 16. Going down to the sea-side, I found a
large tortoise or turtle; this was the rst I had seen,
which, it seems, was only my misfortune, not any
defect of the place, or scarcity; for, had I happened
to be -on the other side of the island, I might have
had hundreds of them every day, as I found after-
wards; but, perhaps, had paid dear enough for
them.
June 17’. I spent in cooking the turtle. I found
in her threescore eggs; and her esh was to me at
that time the most savoury and pleasant that ever I
tasted in my life, having had no esh but of goats
and fowls, since I landed in this horrible place.
June 18. Rained all the day, and I staid within.
I thought, at this time, the rain felt cold, and I was
something chilly, which I knew was not usual in that
latitude. .
June 19. Very ill, and shivering, as if the wea-
ther had been cold.
June 20. No rest all night, violent pains in my
head, and feverish
June 21. Very ill, frighted almost to death with
the apprehensions of my sad condition, to be sick,
and no help. Prayed to God, for the rst time
since the storm off Hull; but scarce knew what I
said, or why: my thoughts being all confused.
June 22. A little better; but under dreadful ap-
prehensions of sickness.
June 23. Very bad again, cold and shivering, and
then a violent head-ach.
June 24. Much better.
June 25. An ague very violent; the t held me
seven hours, cold t and hot, with faint sweats
after it.
June 26. Better; and having no victuals to eat,
took my gun, but found myself very weak: however
I killed a she-goat, and, with much ditculty, got
it home, and broiled some of it, and eat: I would
fain have stewed it, and made some broth, but had
no pot.
June 27. The ague again so violent, that I lay
abed all day, and neither eat nor drank. I was
ready to perish for thirst; but so weak, I had not
strength to stand up, or to get myself any water to
drink: prayed to God again, but was light-headed;
and when I was not, I was so ignorant, that I knew
not what to say ; only I lay, and cried, ‘ Lord, look
upon me! Lord, pity me! Lord, have mercy upon
me !’ I suppose I did nothing else for two or three
hours, till the t wearing off, I fell asleep, and did
not awake till far in the night. When I awaked, I
found myself much refreshed, but weak, and exceed-
ingly thirsty: however, as I had no water in my
whole habitation, I was forced to lie till morning,
and went to sleep again. In this second sleep, I had
this terrible dream: *
I thought that I was sitting on the ground, on the
outside of my wall, where I sat when the storm blew
after the earthquake, and that I saw a man descend
from a great black cloud, in a bright ame of re,
and light upon the ground. He was all over as
bright as a ame, so thatl could but just bear to
look towards him: his countenance was most in-
expressibly dreadful, impossible for words to de-
scribe; when he stepped upon the ground with his
feet, I thought the earth trembled, just as it had
done before in the earthquake ; and all the air
looked, to my apprehension, as if it had been lled
with ashes-of re.
He was no sooner landed upon the earth, but he
moved forward towards me, with a long spear or
weapon in his hand, to kill me; and when he came
to a rising ground, at some distance, he spoke to me,
or I heard a voice so terrible, that it is impossible to
express the terror of it ; all that I can say I under-
stood was this, ‘ Seeing all these things have not
brought thee to repentance, now thou shalt die.’ At
which words, I thought he lifted up the spear that
was in his hand, to kill me.
No one that shall ever read this account, will ex-
pect that I should be able to describe the horrors of
my soul at this terrible vision; I mean, that even
while it was a dream, I even dreamed of those hor-
rors: nor is it any more possible to describe the
impression that remained upon my mind, when I
awaked, and found it was but a dream.
I had, alas! no divine knowledge: what I had
received by the good instruction of my father, was
then worn out by an uninterrupted series, for eight
years, of seafaring wickedness, and a constant con-
versation with none but such as were like myself,
wicked and profane to the last degree. .1 do not re-
member, that I had, in all that time, one thought
that so much as tended either to looking upwards
toward God, or inwards toward a reection upon
-my own ways ; but a certain stupidity of soul, with-
out desire of good, or conscience of evil, had entirely
overwhelmed me, and I was all that the most har-
dened, unthinking, wicked creaturc among our com-
mon sailors can be supposed to be, not having the
least sense either of the fear of God in dangers, or
of thankfulness to God in deliverances.
In the relating what is already past of my story,
this will be the more easily believed, when I shall
add, that, through all the variety of miseries that
had to this day befallen me, I never had so much as
one thought of its being the hand of God, or that it
was a just punishment for my sin, my rebellious be-
haviour against my father, or my present sins, which
were great; or so much as a punishment for the
general course of my wicked life. When I was on
the desperate expedition, on the desert shores of
Africa, I never had so much as one thought of what
would become, of -me, or one wish to God to direct
me whither I should go, or to keep me from the dan-
ger which apparently surrounded me, as well from
voracious creatures as cruel savages; but I was
merely thoughtless of God, or a Providence: I acted
like a mere brute, from the principles of nature, and
by the dictates of common sense only, and indeed
hardly that.
. When I was delivered and taken up at sea by the
Portugal captain, well used, and dealt justly and
honourably with, as well as charitabl y, I had not the
least thankfulness in my thoughts: when again I
was shipwrecked, ruined, and in danger of»dr0wn-
ing on this island, I was as far from remorse, or
looking on it as a judgement; I only said to myself
often, that I was an unfortunate dog, and born to
be always miserable.
It is true, when I got on shore rst here, and
found all my ship’s crew drowned, and myself
spared, I was surprised with a kind of ecstasy and
some transports of soul, which, had the grace of
God assisted, might have come up to true thankful-
ness; but it ended where it began, in a mere com-
mon ight ofjoy, or, as I may say, being glad I was
alive, without the least reection upon the distin-
guishing goodness of the hand which had preserved
me, and had singled me out to be preserved, when
all the rest were destroyed ; or an inquiry why Pro-
vidence had been thus merciful to me; even just
the same common sort of joy which ‘seamen gene-
rally have, after they have got safe ashore from a
shipwreck, which they drown all in the next bowl
of punch, and forget almost as soon as it is over;
and all the rest of my life was like it.
‘ Even when I was afterwards, on due considera-
tion, made sensible of my condition, how I was cast
on this dreadful place, out of the reach of human
kind, out of all hope of relief, or prospect of rc-
demption, as soon as I saw a probability of living,
and that I should not starve and perish for hunger,
all the sense of my affliction wore o’, and I began
to be very easy, applied myself to the works proper
for my preservation and supply, and was far enough
from being aficted at my condition, as a judgement
from heaven, or as the hand of God against me:
these were thoughts which very seldom entered into
my head‘.
The growing up of. the corn, as is hinted in my
journal, had at rst some little inuence upon me.
and began to aiect me with seriousness, as long as I
thought it had something miraculous in it; but as
soon as ever that part of the thought was removed,
all the impression which was raised from it, wore
o’ also, as I have noted already. _ A
Even the earthquake, though nothing could be
more terrible in its nature, or more immediately di-
recting to the invisible Power which alone directs
such things, yet no sooner was the rst fright over,
but the impression it had made went off also. I had
no more sense of God, or his judgements, much less
of the present affliction of my circumstances being
from his hand, than if I had been in the most pro-
sperous condition of life.
But now when I began to be sick, and a leisurely
view of the miseries of death came to place itself be-
fore me; when my spirits began to sink under the
burden of a strong distemper, and nature was ex-
hausted with the violence of the fever; conscience,
that had slept so long, began to awake, and I began
to reproach myself with my past life, in which I had
so evidently, by uncommon wickedness, provoked
the justice of God to lay me under uncommon
strokes, and to deal with me in so vindictive a
manner.
These reections oppressed me from the second
or third day of my distemper, and in the violence, as
well of the fever as of the dreadful reproaches of my
conscience, extorted some words from me, like pray-
ing to God, though 1 cannot say they were either a
prayer attended with desires, or with hopes ; it was
rather the voice of mere fright and distress: my
thoughts were confused, the convictions great upon
my mind, and the horror of dying in such a miser-
able condition, raised vapours into my head, with
the mere apprehensions; and in these hurries of my
soul, I knew not what my tongue might express:
but it was rather exclamation, such as, ‘ Lord!
what a miserable creature am I! If I should be
sick, I shall certainly die for want of help, and
what will become of me!’ Then the tears burst
out of my eyes, and I could say no more for a
good while.
In this interval, the good advice of my father came
to my mind, and presently his prediction, which I
mentioned at the beginning of this story; viz. That,
if I did take this foolish step, God would not bless
me, and I would have leisure hereafter to reect
-
upon having neglected his counsel, when there might
be none to assist me in my recovery. ‘ Now,’ said
I, aloud, ‘ my dear father’s words are come to pass :
God’s justice has overtaken me, and I have none to
help or hear me. I rejected the voice of Provi-
dence, which had mercifully put me in a posture or
station of life wherein I might have been happy and
easy; but I would neither see it myself, nor learn
to know the blessing of it from my parents: I left
them to mourn over my folly, and now I am left to
mourn under the consequences of it. I refused
their help and assistance, who would have lifted me
into the world, and would have made every thing
easy to me ; and now I have diiculties to struggle
with, too great for even nature itself to support,
and no assistance, no help, no comfort, no advice.’
Then I cried out, ‘ Lord, be my help, for I am in
great distress!’
This was the rst prayer, if I might call it so, that
I had made for many years. But I return to my
journal.
June 28. Having been somewhat refreshed with
the sleep I had had, and the t being entirely o", I
got up; and though the fright and terror of my
dream was very great, yet I considered, that the t
of the ague would return again the next day, and
now was my time to get something to refresh and
support myself when I should be ill ; and the rst
thing I did, I lled a large square case bottle with
water, and set it upon my table, in reach of my bed;
and, to take off the chill or aguish disposition of the
water, I put about a quarter of a pint of rum into
it, and mixed them together ; then I got me a piece
of the goat’s esh, and broiled it on the coals, but
could eat very little; I walked about, but was very
weak, and" withal, very sad and heavy-hearted in
the sense of my miserable condition, dreading the
return of my distemper the next day: at night I
made my supper of three of the turt1e’s eggs, which
I roasted in the ashes, and eat, as we call it, in the
shell; and this was the rst bit-of meat I had ever
asked God's blessing to, even, as I could remember,
in my whole life.
After I had eaten, I tried to walk ; but found my-
self so weak, that I could hardly carry the gun (for
I ‘never went out without that); so I went but a
little way, and sat down upon the ground, looking
out upon the sea, which was just before me, and
very calm and smooth. As I sat here,,some such
thoughts as these occurred to me.
What is this earth and sea, of which I have seen
so much? Whence is it produced? And what am
I, and all the other creatures, wild and tame, hu-
man and brutal, whence are we?
Sure we are all made by some secret power, who
formed the earth and sea, the air and sky ; and who
is that?
Then it followed most naturally: It is God that
has made it all. Well, but then it came on strongly:
If God has made all these things, he guides and
governs them all, and all things that concern them;
for the Being that could make all things, must cer-
tainly have power to guide and direct them.
If so, nothing can happen in the great circuit of
his works, either without his knowledge or appoint-
ment. ~
And if nothing happens without his knowledge,
he knows that I am here, and am» in this dreadful
condition; and if nothing happens without his ap-
p_ointment, he has appointed all this to befall me.
Nothing occurred to my thoughts to contradict
anyvof these conclusions; and therefore it rested
upon me with the greater force, that it must needs
be, that God has appointed all this to befall me; that
I was brought to this miserable circumstance by his
direction, he having the sole power, not of me only,
but of every thing that happened iin~the world.
Immediately it followed,
Why has God done this to me? What have I done
to be thus used?
l
My conscience presently checked me in that in-
quiry, as if l had blasphemed; and, methought, it
spoke to me like a voice, Wretch! dost thou ask
what thou hast done? Look back upon a dreadful
mispent life, and ask thyself what thou hast not
done. Ask, Why is it that thou wert not long ago
destroyed? Why wert thou not drowned in Yar-
mouth roads? killed in the ght, when the ship
was taken by the Sallee man of war? devoured by
wild beasts on the coast of Africa? or, drowned
here, when all the crew perished but thyself? Dost
thou ask, What have I done?
I was struck dumb with these reflections, as one
astonished, and had not a word to say, no, not to
answer to myself; but rose up, pensive and sad,
walked back to my retreat, and went up over my
wall, as if I had been going to bed; but my thoughts
were sadly disturbed, and I had no inclination to
sleep; so I sat down in my chair, and lighted my
lamp, for it began to be dark. Now, as the appre-
hensions of the return of my distemper terried me
very much, it occurred to my thought that the Bra-
silians take no physic but their tobacco, for almost all
distempers ; and I had a piece of a roll of tobacco in
one of the chests, which was quite cured, and some
also that was green, and not quite cured.
I went, directed by Heaven, no doubt ; for in this
chest I found a cure both for soul and body. I
opened the chest, and found what I looked for, viz.
the tobacco; and as the few books I had saved lay
there too, I took out one of the Bibles which I
mentioned before, and which, to this time, I had not
found leisure, or so much as inclination, to look into:
I say I took it out, and brought both that and the
tobacco with me to the table.
What use to make of the tobacco I knew not, as to
my distemper, or whether it was good for me or no;
but I tried several experiments with it, as if I was
resolved it should hit one way or other. I rst took
a piece of a leaf, and chewed it in my mouth, which
I-‘
indeed, at rst, almost stupied my brain; the to-
bacco being green and strong, and that I had not
been much used to it: then I took some, and steeped
it an hour or two in rum, and resolved to take a
dose of it when I lay down; and, lastly, I burnt
some upon a pan of coals, and held my nose close
over the smoke of it, as_ long as I could bear it, as
well for the heat as the virtue of it, and I held it
almost to suffocation.
In the interval of this operation, l took up the
Bible, and began to read; but my head was too
much disturbed with the tobacco to bear reading,
at least at that time ; only, having opened the book
casually, the rst words that occurred to me were
these, ‘ Call on me in the day of trouble, and I will
deliver, and thou shalt glorify me.’
The words were very apt to my case, and made
some impression upon my thoughts at the time of
reading them, though not so much as they did after-
wards; fcr, as for being delivered, the word had no
sound, as I may say, to me; the thing was so re-
mote, so impossible in my apprehension of things,
that I began to say as the children of Israel did,
when they were promised esh_ to eat, ‘ Can God
spread a table in the wilderness?’ So Ibegan to
say, Can God himself deliver nie from this place?
And as it was not for many years that any hope ap-
pea' Id, this prevailed very often upon my thoughts.
But, however, the words made a great impression
upon me, and I mused upon them very often. It
grew now late, and the tobacco had, as I said,
dozed my head so much, that I inclined to sleep;
so I left my lamp burning in the cave, lest I should
want any thing in the night, and went to_,_,bed : but
before I lay down, I did what I never had" done in
all my life, I kneeled down, and prayed to God to
full the promise to me, that, if I called upon him in
the day of trouble, he would deliver me. After my
broken and imperfect prayer was over, I drank the
rum in which I had steeped the tobacco, which was
so strong and rank of the tobacco, that indeed I
could scarce get it down. Immediately upon this
I went to bed, and I found presently it ew up into
my head violently; but I fell into a sound sleep,
and waked no more, till, by the sun, it must neces-
sarily be near three o'clock in the afternoon the next
day; nay, to this hour, I am partly of the opinion
that I slept all the next day and night, and till
almost three the day after; for otherwise I knew
not how I should lose a day out of my reckoning in
the days of the week, as it appeared some years after
I had done; for if I had lost it by crossing and re-
crossing the line, I should have lost more than one
day; but certainly I lost a day in my account, and
I never knew which way.
Be that, however, one way or other, when I
awaked I found myself exceedingly refreshed, and
my spirits lively and cheerful. When I got up, I
was stronger than I was the day before, and my
stomach better; for I was hungry, and, in short, I
had no t the next day, but continued much altered
for the better. This was the 29th,
The 30th was my well day, of course, and I went
abroad with my gun, but did not care to travel too
far. I killed a sea-fowl or two, something like a
brand-goose, and brought them home, but was not
very forward to eat them; so I eat some more-of
the turtle’s eggs, which were very good. This even-
ing Irenewed the medicine, which I had supposed
did me good the day before, viz. the tobacco steeped
in rum, only I did not take so much as before, nor
did I chew any of the leaf, or hold my head over the
smoke. However, I was not so well the next day,
which was the 1st of July, as I hoped I should have
been; for I had a little spice of the cold t, but it
was not much. -
July ‘Z. I renewed the medicine all the three
ways, and dosed myself with it as at rst, and dou-
bled the quantity which I drank.
July 3. I missed the t for good and all, though
I did not recover my full strength for some weeks
after. While I was thus gathering strength, my
thoughts ran exceedingly upon this Scripture, ‘ I
will deliver thee ;‘ and the impossibility of my de-
liverance lay much upon my mind, in bar of my ever
expecting it. But as I was discouraging myself
with such thoughts, it occurred to my mind, that I
pored so much upon my deliverance from the main
aflliction, that I disregarded the deliverance I had
received; and 1 was, as it were, made to ask my-
self such questions as these: viz. Have I not been
delivered, and wonderfully too, from sickness; from
the most distressed condition that could be, and
that was so frightful to me? And what notice had
I taken of it? I-Iad I done my part? God had
delivered me: but I had not gloried him; that is
to say, I had not owned and been thankful for that
as a deliverance; and how could I expect greater
deliverance P ‘
This touched my heart very much, and imme-
diately I kneeled down, and gave God thanks aloud,
for my recovery from sickness.
July 4-. In the morning, I took the Bible_; and,
beginning at the New Testament, I began seriously
to read it, and imposed upon myself to read a while
every morning and every night, not tying myself to
a. number of chapters, but as long as my thoughts
should engage -me. It was not long after I set
seriously to this work, but I found my heart more
deeply and sincerely affected with the wickedness of
my past life. The impression of my dream revived,
and the words, ‘ All these things have not brought
thee to repentance,’ ran seriously in my thoughts. I
was earnestly begging of God to give me repent-
ance, whcn it happened providcntially, the very
day, that, reading the Scripture, I came to these
words, ‘ He is exalted a Prince, and a Saviour, to
give repentance, and to give remission.’ I threw
down the book, and, with my heart, as well as my
hands, lifted up to Heaven, in a kind of ecstacy of
joy, I cried out aloud, ‘ Jesus, thou Son of David,
Jesus, thou exalted Prince and Saviour, give me
repentance !’
. This was the rst time that I could say, in the
true sense of the words, that I prayed in all my
life; for now I prayed with a sense of my con-
dition, and with a true Scripture view of hope,
founded on the encouragement of the word of God;
and from this time, I may say, I began to have hope
that God would hear me.
Now I began to construe the words mentioned
above, ‘ Call on me, and I will deliver you,’ in a
different sense from what I had ever done before;
for then I had no notion of any thing being called
deliverance, but my being delivered from the cap-
tivity I was in , for though I was indeed at large in
the place, yet the island was certainly a prison to
me, and that in the worst sense in the world ; but
now I learned to take it in another sense. Now, I
looked back upon my past life with such horror, and
my sins appeared so dreadful, that my soul sought
nothing of God but deliverance from the load of
guilt that bore down all my comfort. As for my
solitary life, it was nothing; I did not so much as
pray to be delivered from it, or think of it: it was
all of no consideration in comparison of this; and
I add this part here, to hint to whoever shall
read it, that whenever they come to atrue sense
of things, they will nd deliverance from sin a
much greater blessing, than deliverance from af-
iction.
But, leaving this part, I return to my journal.
My condition began now to be, though not less
miserable as to my way of living, yet much easier
to my mind; and my thoughts being directed, by a
constant reading the Scripture, and praying to God,
to things of higher nature, I had a great deal ot
comfort within, which, till now, I knew nothing of.
Also, as my health and strength returned, I be-
stirred myself ~to furnish myself with every thing
\
that I wanted, and make my way of living as regu-
lar as I could. ~
From the 4th of July to the 14-th, I was chiey
employed in walking about with my gun in my
hand, a little and a little at a time, as a man that
was gathering up his strength after a t of sickness:
for it is hardly to be imagined how low I was, and
to what weakness I was reduced. The application
which I made use of, was perfectly new, and perhaps
what had never cured an ague before; neither can
'1 recommend it to any one to practise, by this expe-
riment; and though it did carry oil‘ the t, yet it
rather contributed to weaken me: for I had fre-
quent convulsions in my nerves and limbs for some
time.
I learnt from it also this in particular, that being
abroad in the rainy season was the most pernicious
thing to my health that could be, especially in those
rains which came attended with storms and hurri-
canes of wind ; for as the rain which came in a dry
season, was always most accompanied with such
storms,» so I found this rain was much more danger-
ous than the rain which fell in September and
October. '
I had been now in this unhappy island above ten
months: all possibility of deliverance from this con-
dition seemed to be entirely taken from me; and I
rmly believed that no human shape had ever set
foot upon that place. Having now secured my
habitation, as I thought, fully to my mind, I had a
greatdcsire to make a more perfect discovery of the
island, and to see what other productions I might
lind,whicb yet I knew nothing of. '
It was the 15th of July that I began to take a
more particular survey of the island itself. I went
up the creek iirst, where, as I hinted, I brought my
rafts on shore. I found, after I came about two
miles up, that the tide did not ow ‘any higher, and
that it was no more than a little brook of running
water, and very fresh and good; but this being the
dryseason, there washardly any water in some parts
of it, at least not enough to run in any stream, so
as it ‘could be perceived.
On the bank of this brook, I found many pleasant
savannas or meadows, plain, smooth, and covered
with grass; and, on the rising parts of them, next
to the higher grounds, where the water, as it might
be supposed, never overowed, I found a great deal
of tobacco, green, and growing to a great and very
strong stalk. There were divers other plants, which
I had no notion of; or understanding about; and
might, perhaps, have virtues of their own, which I
could not nd out.
I searched for the Cassava root, which the In-
dians, in all that climate, make their bread of; but
I could nd none. I saw large plants of aloes, but
did not then understand them. I saw several sugar-
canes, but wild, and, for want of cultivation, im-
perfect. I contented myself with these discoveries
for this time, and came back, musing with myself
what course I might take to know the virtue and
goodness of any of'th'e fruits or plants which I should
discover, but could bring it to no conclusion ; for, in
short, I had made so little observation while l was
in the Brasils, that I knew little of the plants of the
eld, at least very little that might serve me to any
purpose now in my distress.
The next day, the 16th, I went up the same way
again; and, after going something farther than I had
gone the day before, I found the brook and the sa-
vannas began to cease, and the country became more
woody than before. In this part l found dierent
fruits, and particularly I found melons upon the
ground, in great abundance. and grapes upon the
trees: the vines had spread indeed over the trees,
and the clusters of grapes were just now in their
prime, very ripe and rich. This was a surprising dis-
covery, and I was exceeding glad of them; but I
was warned, by my experience, to eat sparingly of
them, remembering that when I was ashore in Bar.
bary, the eating of grapes killed several of our Engk
lishmen, who were slaves there, by throwing them
into uxes and fevers : but I ‘found an excellent use
for these grapes, and that was to cure or dry them
in the sun, and keep them as dried grapes or raisins
are kept, which I thought would be, as indeed they
were, as wholesome, and as agreeable to eat,‘when
no grapes might be had.
- I spent all that evening there, and went not baok
to my habitation, which, by the way, was the rst
-night, as I might say, I had lain from home. In the
night I took my rst contrivance, and got up into a
tree, where I slept well, and the next morning
proceed-ed upon my discovery, travelling near four
miles, as I might judge by the length of the valley,
keeping still due north, with a ridge of hills on the
south and north side of me.
At the end of this march, I came to an opening,
where the country seemed to descend to the west ;
and a little spring of fresh water, which issued out
of the side of the hill by me, ran the other way, that
is, due east; and the country appeared so fresh, so
green, so ourishing, every thing being in a constant
verdure or ourish of spring, that it looked like a.
planted garden.
I descended a little on the side of that delicious
valley, surveying it with a secret kind of pleasure
(though mixed with other afflicting thoughts), to
think that this was all my own, that I was king
and lord of all this country inde-feasibly, and had a
right of possession; and, if I could convey it, I
might have it in inheritance, as completely as any
lord of amanor in England. I saw here abundance
of cocoa-trees, orange and lemon and citron-trees ;
but all wild, and few bearing any fruit, at least not
-then. However, the green limes that I gathered
were not only pleasant to eat, but very wholesome ;
and I mixed their juice afterwards with water,
which made it very wholesome, and very cool and
refreshing. ' .
1
I found now I had business enough to gather
and carry home; and I resolved to lay up a store,
aswell of grapes as limes and lemons, to furnish
myself for the wet season, which I knew was ap-
proaching.
-In order to this, I gathered a great heap of
grapes in one place, and a lesser heap in another
place, and a great parcel of limes and lemons in
another place; and, taking a few of each with me,
I travelled homeward, and resolved to come again,
and bring a bag or sack, or what I could make,‘ to
carry the rest home. '
- Accordingly, having spent three days in this jour-
ney, Icame home ‘(so I must now call my tent, and
my cave); but, before I got thither, the grapes were
spoiled: the richness of the fruit, and the weight
of'-the juice, having broken them and bruised them,
they were good for little or nothing ; as to the limes,
they were good, but I could bring but a few.
The next day, being the 19th, I went back, having
made me two small bags to bring home my harvest;
but I was surprised, when coming to my heap of
grapes, which were so rich and ne when I gathered
them, I found them all spread abroad, trod to pieces,
and dragged about, some here, some there, and
abundance eaten and devoured. By this, I con-
cluded, there were some wild creatures thereabouts,
which had done this; but what they were, I knew
not. - '
However, as I found there was no laying them up
on heaps, and no carrying them away in" a sack, but
that one way they would be destroyed, and the
other way they would be ‘crushed with their own
weight, I took another ‘course; for I gathered a
large quantity of the grapes, and hung them upon
the out-branches of the trees, that they might cure
and dry in the sun; and as for the limes and
lemons, I carried as many back as I could well
stand under.
When I came -home from this journey, Iicnntem-
F 2
plated, with great pleasure, the fruitfulness of that
valley, and the pleasantness of the situation, the
security from storms on that side of the water, and
the wood ; and concluded that I had pitched upon
a place to x my abode, which was, by far, the worst
part of the country. Upon the whole, I began to
consider of removing my habitation, and to look
out for a place equally safe as where I now was
situate, if possible, in that pleasant fruitful part of
the island.
This thought run long in my head, and I was ex-
ceeding fond of it for some time, the pleasantness
of the place tempting me; but when I came to.a
nearer view of it, and to consider that I was now.
by the sea-side, where it was at least possible that
something might happen to my advantage, and that
the same ill fate that brought me hither, might bring
some other unhappy wretches to the same place;
and though it was scarce probable, that any such
thing should ever happen, yet, to enclose myself
among the hills and woods, in the centre of the
island, was to anticipate my bondage, and to ren-
der such an afair not only improbable, but impos-
sible; and that therefore I ought not, by any means,
to remove.
However, I was so enamoured with this place,
that I spent much of my time there, for the whole
remaining part of the month of July; and though,
upon second thoughts, I resolved as above, not
to remove, yet I built me a little kind of a bower,
and surrounded it, at a distance, with a strong
fence, being a double hedge, as high as I could
reach, well staked and lled between with brush~
wood; and here I lay very secure, sometimes two
or three nights together, always going over it with
a ladder, as before, so that I fancied now I had my
country house, and my sea-coast house: and this
work took me up to the beginning of August.
I had but newly nished my fence, and began to
enjoy my labour, when the rains came on, and made
me stick close to my rst habitation; for though I
had made me a tent like-the other, with a piece
of a sail, and spread it very well, yet I had not
the shelter of a hill to keep me from storms, nor a
cave behind me to retreat into, when the rains were
extraordinary.
About the beginning of August, as I said, I had
nished my bower, and began to enjoy myself. The
3d of August, I found the grapes I had hung up
were perfectly dried, and indeed were excellent
good raisins of the sun; so I began to take them
down from the trees, and it was very happy that 1
did so, for the rains which followed would have
spoiled them, and I had lost the best part ofmy
winter food; for I had above two hundred large
bunches of them. No sooner had I taken them
all down, and carried most of them home to my
cave, but it began to rain ; and from hence, which
was the 14th of August, it rained more or less
every day, till the middle of October; and some-
times so violently that I could not stir out of my
cave for several days.
In this season, I was much surprised with the
increase of myfamily. I had been concerned for
the loss of one of my cats, who ran away from me,
or, as I thought had been dead; and I heard no
more tale or tidings of her, till, to my astonishment,
she came home about the end of August, with three
kittens. This was the more strange to me, because,
though I had killed a wild cat, as I called it, with
my gun, yet I thought it was a quite different kind
from our European cats; yet the young cats were
the same kind of house-breed, like the old one ; and
both my cats being females, I thought it very
strange. But from these three cats, I afterwards
came to be so pestered with cats, that I was forced
to kill them like vermin, or wild beasts, and to drive
them from my house as much as possible.
From the 14-th of August to the 26th, incessant
rain, so that I could not stir, and was now very
careful not to be much wet. In this connement
I began to be straitened for food; but venturing
out twice, I one _day killed a goat; and the last
day, which was the 26th, found a very large tor-
toise, which was a treat to me, and _my food was
regulated thus: I eat a bunch of raisins for my
breakfast, a-piece of the goat's esh, or of the turtle,
for my dinner, broiled (for, to my great misfortune,
I had no vessel to boil or stew any thing), and two
or three of the turtlc‘s eggs for supper.
During this connement in my cover by the rain,
I worked daily two or three hours at enlarging my
cave; and, by degrees, worked it on towards one
side, till I came to the outside of the hill, and made
a door or way out, which came beyond my fence or
wall, and so I came in and out this way. But I was
not perfectly easy at lying so open; for, as I had
managed myself before, I was in a perfect enclo-
sure, whereas now I thought I lay exposed: and
yet I could not perceive that there was any living
thing to fear, the biggest creature that I had yet
seen upon the island being a goat.
” September the "30th. I was now come to the un-‘
happy anniversary of my landing. I cast up the
notches on my post, and found I had been on shore
three hundred and sixty-ve days. I kept this day
as a solemn fast, setting it apart to religious exer-
cise, prostrating myself on the ground with the
most serious humiliation, confessing my sins to God,
acknowledging his righteous judgements upon me,
and praying to him to have mercy on me, through
Jesus Christ; and having not tasted the least rc-
freshmcnt for twelve hours, even till the going
down of the sun, I thcn eat a biscuit cake, and a
bunch of grapes, and went to bed, nishing the day
as I began it.
I had all this time observed no Sabbath-day; for
as at rst I had no sense of religion upon my mind.
I had after some time omitted to distinguish the
weeks, by making a longer notch than ordinary for
the Sabbath-day, and so did not really know what
any of the days were; but now having cast up the
days as above, I found I had been there a year, so
I divided it into weeks, and set apart every seventh
day for a Sabbath; though I found at the end of
my account, I had losta day or two in my reckoning.
A little after this,,my ink began to fail me, and so
I contented myself to use it more sparingly, and to
write down only the most remarkable events of my
life, without continuing a daily memorandum of
other things.
The rainy season, and the dry season, began now
to appear regular to me, and I learned to divide
them so as to provide for them accordingly. But I
bought all my experience before I had it: and this
I am going to relate, was one of the most discourag~
ing experiments that I made at all. I have men-
tioned, that I had saved the few ears of barley and
rice, which I had so surprisingly found spring up,
as I thought, of themselves, and believe there were
about thirty stalks of rice, and about twenty of
barley ; and now I thought it a proper time to sow
it after the rains, the sun being in its southern posi-
tion, -going, from me.
Accordingly, I dug up apiece of ground, as well
as I could, with my wooden spade, and dividing it
into two parts, I sowed my grain ;, but, as I was
sowing, it casually occurred to my thoughts, that I
would not sow it all at rst, because I did not
know when was the proper time for it; so I sowed
about two-thirds of the seed, leaving about a hand-
ful of each.
It was a great comfort to me afterwards that I
did so, for not one grain of that I sowed this time
came to any thing; for the dry months following,
the earth having had no rain after the seed was
sown, it hadno moisture to assist its growth, and
never came up at all, till the wet season had come
again, and then it grew as if it had been but newly
sown.
Finding my rst seed did not grow, which I easiiy
imagined was by the drought, I sought for a rnoister
piece of ground to make another trial in ; and I dug
up a piece of ground near my new bower, and sowed
the rest of my seed in February, a little before the
vernal equinox ; and this, having therainy months
of March and April to water it, sprung up very
pleasantly, and yielded a very good crop; but hav-
ing part of the seed left only, and not daring to sow
all that I had yet, I had but a small quantity at last,
my whole crop not amounting to above half a peck
of each kind.
But, by this experiment, I was made master of
my business, and knew exactly when the proper
season was to sow ; and that I might expect two
seed-times, and two harvests, every year. -
While this corn was growing, I made a little disco-
very, which was of use to me afterwards. As soon
as the rains were over, and the weather began to
settle, which was about the mouth of November, I
made a visit up the country to my bower, where,
though I had not been some months, yet I found all
things just as I left them. The circle, or double
hedge, that I had made, was not only rm and
entire, but the stakes which I had cut off of some
trees that grew thereabouts, were all shot out, and
grown with long branches, as much as a willow-tree
usually shoots the rst year after lopping its head.
I could not tell what tree to call it that these stakes
were cut from. I was surprised, and yet very well
pleased, to see the young trees grow; and I pruned
them, and led them up to grow as much alike as
I could: and it is scarce credible how beautiful a
gure they grew into in three years, so that though
the hedge made a circle of about twenty-ve yards
in diameter, yet the trees, for such I might now
call them, soon covered it; and it was a ‘complete
shade, sufficient to lodge under all the dry season.
This made me resolve to cut some more stakes,
and make me a hedge, like this, in a semicircle,
round my wall, I mean that of my rst dwelling,
which I did ; and, placing the trees or stakes in a
double row, at about eight yards’ distance from my
rst fence, they grew presently, and were, at rst,
a fine cover to my habitation, and afterwards served
for a defence also, as I shall observe in its order.
I found now that the seasons of the year might
generally be divided, not into summer and winter,
as in Europe; but into the rainy season, and the
dry season, which were generally thus :

er, as the winds happened to blow; but this was
the general observation I made. After I had found,
by experience, the ill consequence of being abroad
in the rain, I took care to furnish myself with pro-
visions before-hand, that I might not be obliged to go
out; and I sat within doors, as much as possible,
during the wet months.
In this time I found much employment (and very
suitable also to the time); for I found great occa-
sion of many things which I had no way to furnish
myself with, but by hard labour, and constant appli-
cation: particularly, I tried many ways to make
myself a basket; but all the twigs I could‘ get for
the purpose proved so brittle, that they would do
nothing. It proved of excellent advantage to me
now, that, when I was a boy, I used to take great
delight in standing at a basket-maker’s, in the town
where my father lived, to see them make their
wicker-ware; and being, as boys usually are, very
ofcious to help, and a great observer of the man-
ner how they worked those things, and sometimes
lending a hand, I had, by this means, so ‘full knowledge
of the methods of it, that I wanted nothing but the
materials: when it came into my mind, that the
twigs of that tree, from whence I cut my stakes
that grew, might possibly be as tough as the sallows,
and willows, and osiers in England; and I resolved
to try.
Accordingly, the next day, I went to my country
house, as I called it, and cutting some of the smaller
twigs, I found them to my purpose as much as I
could desire; whereupon I came the next time pre-
pared with ahatchet to out down a quantity, which
I soon found, for there was great plenty of them.
These I set up to dry within my circle or hedge,
and when they were t for use, I carried them to
my cave; and here, during the next season, I em-
ployed myself in making, as well as I could, a great
many baskets, both to carry earth, or to carry or lay
up any thing, as I had occasion; and though I did
not nish them very handsomely, yet I made them
sufficiently serviceable for my purpose: and ‘thus,
afterwards, I took care never to be without them;
and, as my wicker-ware decayed, I mademore;
especially I made strong deep baskets to place my
corn in, instead of sacks, when I should come to
have any quantity of it. ' ' '
'v Having mastered this diicultyy and employed a
world of time about it, I bestirred myself to see, if
possible, ~how to supply two wants. I had no ves-
sels to hold any thing that was-liquid, except two
runlets, which were almost full of rum, and some
-glass bottles, some of the common size, and others
which were case-bottles square, for the holding of
waters, spirits, &c. I had not so much as a pot to
boil any thing in, except a great kettle which I
saved out of the ship, and which was too big for
such uses as I desired it for, viz. to make broth, and
stew a bit of meat by itself. The second thing I
would fain have had, was a tobacco-pipe; but it was
impossible for me to make one: however, I found a
contrivance for that too at last.
, I employed myself in planting myasecond rows of
stakes or piles, and in this wicker-work, all the
summer, or dry season; when another business took
me up more time than it could be imagined I could
I mentioned before, that I had a great mind to see
the whole island, and that I had travelled up the
brook, and so on to where I built my bower, and
where I had an opening quite to the sea, on the
other side of the island. I now resolved to travel
quite cross to the sea-shore on that side ; so taking
my gun, a hatchet, and my dog,. and alarger quan-
tity of powder and shot than usual, with two biscuit
cakes, and a- great bunch of raisins in my pouch, for
my store, I began my journey. When I had passed
the vale where my bower stood, as above, I came
within view of the sea, to the west; and it being a
very clear day, I fairly descried land, whether an
island or a continent, I could not tell; but it lay
very high, extending from the west, to the W.S.W.
at a very great distance: by my guess, it could not
be less than fteen or twenty leagues off.
I could not tell what part of the world this might
be, otherwise than that I knew it must be part of
America; and, as I concluded, by all my observa-
tions, must be near the Spanish dominions, and
perhaps was all inhabited by savages, where, if I
should have landed, I had been in a worse con~
dition than I was now ; and therefore I acquiesced
in the dispositions of Providence, which I began
now to own, and to believe, ordered every thing
for the best; I say, I quieted my mind with this,
and left aficting myself with fruitless wishes of
being there. -
Besides, after some pause upon this affair, I con-
sidered, that if this land was the Spanish coast, I
should certainly, one time or other, see some ves-
sels pass or repass one way or other; but if not,
then it was the savage coast between the Spanish
country and Brasils, which were indeed the worst
of savages, for they are cannibals, or men-eaters, and
fail not to murder and devour all the human bodies
that fall into their hands.
With these considerations I walked very leisurely
forward. I found that side of the island where I
now was much pleasanter than mine, the open or
savanna elds sweet, adorned with owers and grass,
and full of very ne woods. I saw abundance of
parrots, and fain would I have caught one, if pos-
sible, to have kept it to be tame, and taught it to
speak to me. I did, after some pains taking, catch
a young parrot; for I knocked it down with a stick,
and having recovered it, I brought it home, but it
was some years before I could make him speak.
However, at last I taught him to call me by my
name very familiarly. But the accidentthat fol-
lowed, though it be a trie, will be very diverting
in its place. '
I was exceedingly diverted with this journey. I
found in the low grounds, hares, as I thought them
to be, and foxes, but they differed greatly from all
the other kinds I had met with; nor could'I satisfy
myself to eat them, though I killed several. But I
had no need to be venturous, for I had no want of
food, and of that which was very good too; espe-
cially these three sorts, viz. goats, pigeons, and tur-
tle or tortoise, which, added to my grapes, Leaden-
hall market could not have furnished =1" table better
than I, in proportion to the company. And though
my case was deplorable enough, yet I had great
cause for thank-fulness, that I was not driven to ‘any
extremities for food; but had rather plenty, even to
dainties. r
I never travelled in this journey above two miles
outright in a day, or thereabouts; but I took so
many turns and returns to see what discoveries I
could make, that I came weary enough to the place
where I resolved to sit down for all night: and
then I either reposed myself in a tree, or surrounded
myself with a row of stakes set upright in the
ground, either from one tree to another, or so as
no wild creature could come at me, without waking
me. ‘
As soon as I came to the sea~shore, I was sur-
prised to see that I had taken up my lot on the
worst side of the island ; for here indeed the shore
was covered with innumerable turtles; whereas
on the other side I had found but three in a
year and a half. Here was also an innite num-
ber of fowls, of many kinds, some of which I had
seen, and some of which I had not seen before,
and many of them very good meat; but such as
I knew not the names of, except those called
penguins.
I could have shot as many as I pleased, but wa's
very sparing of my powder and shot; and there-
fore had more mind to kill a she-goat, if I could,
which I could better feed on. And though there
were many goats here more than on my side of
the island, yet it was with much more difficulty
that I could come near them, the country being at
and even, and they saw me much sooner than when
I was on the hills. _
I confess this side of the country was much plea-
santer than mine, but yet I had not the least incli-
nation to remove; for as I was xed in my habita-
tion, it became natural to me; and I seemed all the
while I was here, to be, as it were, upon .1 journey,
and from home. However, I travelled along the
shore of the sea, towards the east, I suppose, about
twelve miles; and then setting up a great pole upon
the shore, for a mark, I concluded I would go home
again; and that the nextjourney I took, should be on
the other side of the island, east from my dwelling,
and so round, till I came to my post again: of which
in its place.
. I took another way to come back than that I
went, thinking I could easily keep all the island so
much in my view, that I could not miss nding my
rst dwelling, by viewing the country : but I found
myself mistaken; for being come about two or three
miles, I found myself descended into a very large
valley, but so surrounded with hills, and those hills
covered with woods, that I could not see which
was my way by any direction but that of the sun,
nor even then, unless I knew very well the position
of the sun at that time of the day.
It happened, to my farther misfortune, that the
weather proved hazy for three or four days, while I
was in this valley ; and not being able to see the
sun, I wandered about very uncomfortably, and at
last was obliged to nd out the sea-side, look for
my post, and come back the same way I went; and
then, by easy journeys, I turned homeward, the
weather being exceeding hot; and my gun, ammu-
nition, hatchet, and other things, very heavy.
In this journey my dog surprised a young kid,
and seized upon it; and I running in to take hold
of it, caught it, and saved it alive from the dog. I
had a great mind to bring it home, if I could ; for I
had often been musing whether it might not be~pos-
sible to get a kid or two, and so raise a breed of
tame goats, which might supply me when my powder
and shot should be all spent.
I made a collar to this little creature, and with
a string, which I made of some rope-yarn, which I
always carried about me, I led him along, though
with some difficulty, till I came to my bower, and
there I enclosed him, and left him ; for I was very
impatient to be at home, from whence I had been
absent above a month.
I cannot express what a satisfaction it was to me
to come into my old hutch, and lie down in my
hammock-bed. This little wanderingjouruey, without
any settled place of abode, had been so unpleasant
to me, that my own house, as I called it to myself,
was a perfect settlement to me, compared to that;
and it rendered every thing about me so comfort-
able, that I resolved I would never go a great way
from it again, while it should be my lot to stay on
the island.
I reposed myself here a week, to rest and regale
myself after my long journey, during which, most
of the time was taken up in the weighty affair of
making a cage for my poll, who began now to be a
mere domestic, and to be mighty well acquainted
with me. Then I began to think of the poor kid,
which I had pent in within my little circle, and
resolved to go and fetch it home, or give it some
food: accordingly I went, and found it where I left
it, for indeed it could not get out, but was almost
starved for want of food. I went and cut boughs
of trees, and branches of such shrubs as I could
nd, and threw it over; and having fed it, I tied it
as I did before, to lead it away; but it was so tame
with being hungry, that I had no need to have tied
it, for it followed me like a dog: and as I continu-
ally fed it, the creature became so loving, so gentle,
and so fond, that it became, from that time, one
of my domestics also, and would never leave me
afterwards.
The rainy season of the autumnal equinox was
now come, and I kept the 30th of September in the
same solemn manner as before, being the anniver-
sary of my landing on the island, having now been
there two years, and no more prospect of being de-
livered than the rst day I came there. I spent the
whole day in humble and thankful acknowledge-
ments of the many wonderful mercies which my
L
solitary condition was attended with, and without
which it might have been innitely more miserable.
I gave humble and hearty thanks, that God had
been pleased to discover to me, even that it was
possible I might be more happy in this solitary con-
dition, than I should have been in a liberty of
society, and in all the plea-sures of the world ; that
he could fully make up to me the deciencies of my
solitary state, and the want of human society, by
his presence,'_and the communications of his grace to
my soul,_supporting, comforting, and encouraging
me to depend upon his providence here, and hope
for his eternal presence hereafter.
It was now that I began sensibly to feel how
much more happy the life I now led was, with all
its miserable circumstances, than the. wicked, curs-
ed, abominable life I led all the past part of my
days; and now having changed both my sorrows
and my joys, my very desires altered, my affections
changed their gusts, and my delights were perfectly
new, from what they were at my rst coming, or in-
deed for the two years past.
p Before, as I walked about, either on my hunting,
or for viewing the country, the anguish of my soul
at my condition would break out upon me on a
sudden, and my very heart would die within me,
to think of the woods, the mountains, the deserts
I was in; and how I was a prisoner locked up, with
the eternal bars and bolts of the ocean, in an unin-
habited wilderness, without redemption. In the
midst of the greatest composures of my mind, this
would break out upon me, like a storm, and make
me wring my hands, and weep like a child. Some-
times it would take me in the middle of my work,
and I would immediately sit down and sigh, and
look upon the ground for an hour or two together,
and this was still worse to me; for if I could burst
out into tears, or vent myself by words, it would
go off, and the grief, having exhausted itself, would
abate. . - -
But now I began to exercise myself with new
thoughts. I daily read the word of God, and
applied all the comforts of it to my present state.
One morning, being very sad, I opened the Bible
upon these words, ‘ I will never, never leave thee,
nor forsake thee !’ Immediately it occurred, that
these words were to me; why else should they be
directed in such a manner, just at the moment
when I was mourning over my condition, as one
forsaken of God and man? ‘Well then,’ said I, ‘if
God doesnot forsake me, of what ill consequence
can it be, or_what matters it, though the world
should all forsake me, seeing, on the other hand,
if I had all the world, and should lose the favour
and blessing of God, there would be no comparison
in the loss?’
From this moment I began to conclude in my
mind, that it was possible for me to be more happy
in this forsaken, solitary condition, than it was
probable I should have ever been in any other par-
ticular state in the world; and, with this thought,
I was going to give thanks to God for bringing me
to this place. ~ I
I know not what it was, but something shocked
my mind at that thought, and I durst not speak the
words. ‘How canst thou be such a hypocrite (said
I, even audibly), to pretend to be thankful for a
condition which, however thou mayest endeavour
to be contented with, thou wouldst rather pray
heartily to be delivered from?’ So I stopped there.
But though I could not say, I thanked God for
being there; yet I sincerely gave thanks to God for
opening my eyes, by whatever afflicting providences,
to see the former condition of my life, and to
mourn for my wickedness, and repent. I never
opened the Bible, or shut it, but my very soul
within me blessed God for directing my friend in
England, without any order of mine, to pack it
up among my goods, and for assisting me after-
wards to save it out of the wreck of the ship.

- Thus, and in this disposition of mind, I began my
third year; and-thoughl have not given the reader
the trouble of so particular an account of my works
this year as the rst; yet in general it may be
observed, that I was very seldom idle, having regu-
larly divided my time according to the several
daily omployments that were before me; such as,
First, My duty to God, and reading the Scriptures,
which. I constantly set apart some time for, thrice
every day. Secondly, The going abroad with my
gun for food, which generally took me up three
hours in every morning, when it did not rain.
Thirdly, The ordering, curing, preserving, and cook-
ing whatl had killed or catched for my supply ;
these took up great part of the day. Also it
is to be considered, that the middle of the day,
when the sun was in the zenith, the violence of the
heat was too great to stir out, so that about four
hours in the evening was all the time 1 could be
supposed to work in; with this exception, that
sometimes I changed my hours of hunting and
working, and went to work in the morning, and
abroad with my gun in the afternoon.
To this short time allowed for-labour, I desire
may be added the exceeding laboriousness of my
work, the many hours, which, for want of tools,
want of help, and want of skill, every thing that I
did, took up out ofmy time. For example, I was full
two-and-forty days making me a board for a long
shelf, which I wanted in my cave; whereas two
Sawyers, with their tools and a sawpit, would have
cut six of them, out of the same tree, inhalf a
day.
V My case was this: it was to be a large tree which
was to be cut down, because my board was to be a
broad one. This tree I was three days a cutting
down, and two more cutting otf the boughs, and
reducing it to a log or piece of timber.- With in-
expressible hacking and hcwing, I reduced both
the sides of it into chips, till it began to be light
enough to move; then I turned it, and made one
side of it smooth and at as a board, from end to
end; then turning that side downward, cut the
other side, till I brought the plank to be about
three inches thick, and smooth on both sides. Any
one may judge the labour of my hands in such a
piece of work; but labour and patience carried me
through that, and many other things. [only ob-
serve this in particular, to show the reason why so
much of my time went away with so little work,
viz. that what might be a little to be done with
help and tools, was a vast labour, and required u
prodigious time to do alone, and by hand.
But, notwithstanding this, with patience and
labour I went through many things, and indeed
every thing that my circumstances made necessary
for me to do, as will appear by what follows.
I was now in the months of November and De-
cember, expecting my erop of barley and rice. The
ground I had manured or dug up for them was
not great; for, as I observed, my seed of each was
not above the quantity of half a peck, for I had
lost one whole crop by sowing in the dry season,
but now my crop promised very well, when, on a
sudden, I found I was in danger of losing it all
again, by enemies of several sorts, which it was
scarce possible to keep from it; as rst, the goats,
and wild creatures which I called hares, who,
tasting the sweetness of the blade, lay in it night
and day, as soon as it came up, and eat it so close,
that it could get no time to shoot up into stalk.
This I saw no remedy for, but by nmking an en-
closure about it with a hedge, which I did with a
great deal of toil, and the more because it required
speed, the creatures daily spoiling my corn. I~Iow-
ever, as my arable land was but small, suited to my
crop, I got it totally well fenced in about three
weeks’ time; and shooting seine of the creatures in
the day time, ‘I set my dog to guard it iu the night,
tying him up to a stake at the gate, where he
G *
would stand and bark all night long; so, in a little
time, the enemies forsook the place, and the corn
grew very strong and well, and began to ripen
apace.
But, as the beasts ruined me before, while my
corn was in the blade, so the birds were as likely to
ruin me now, when it was in the ear; for going
along _by the place to see how it throve, I saw my
little crop surrounded with fowls, of I know not
how many sorts. who stood, as it were, watching
till I should be gone. I immediately let y among
them (for I always had my gun with me). I had
no sooner shot, but there rose up a little cloud of
fowls, which I had not seen at all, from among the
corn itself.
This touched me sensibly; for I foresaw that, in
a few days, they would devour all my hopes; that
I should be starved, and never be able to raise a
crop at all; and what to do, I could not tell.
However, I resolved not to lose my corn, if pos-
sible, though I should watch it night and day. In
the rst place, I went among it to see what
damage was already done, and found they had
spoiled a good deal of it; but that, as it was yet
too green for them, the loss was not so great, but
that the remainder was like to be a good crop, if it
could be saved.
I staid by it to load my gun, and then coming
away, I could easily see the thieves sitting upon all
the trees about me, as if they only waited till I was
gone away, and the event proved it to be so; for
as I walked off as if I was gone, I was no sooner
out of their sight, but they dropped down, one by
one, into the corn again. I was so provoked, that I
could not have patience to stay till more came on,
knowing that every grain that they eat now, was,
as it might be said, a peck loaf to me in the conse-
quence; but, coming up to the hedge, I red again,
and killed three of them. This was what l wished
for; so I took them up, and served them as we
"serve notorious thieves in England, viz. hanged
them, in chains for a terror to others. It is impos-
sible to imagine almost that this should have such
an effect as it had; for the fowls would not only
not_ come at the corn, but, in short, they forsook
all that part of the island, and I could never see a
bird near the place as long as my scarecrows hung
there.
This I was very glad of, you may be sure; and,
about the latter end of December, which was our
second harvest of the year, I reaped my crop.
I was sadly put to it for a scythe, or a sickle, to
cut it down, and all I could do was to-make one as
well as I could, out of one of the broad swords, or
cutlasses, which I saved among the arms out of the
ship. However, as my crop was but small, I had
no great diiculty to cut it down. In short, I
reaped it my way; for I cut nothing off but the
ears, and carried it away in algreat basket which I
had made, and so rubbed it out with my hands.
And at the end of all my harvesting, I found that,
out of my half peck of seed, I had near two
bushels of rice,~ and above two bushels and a half
of/barley; that is to say, by my guess, for I had no
measure at that time.
However, this was a great encouragement to me;
and I foresaw that, in time, it would please God to
supply mo with bread. And yet here I was per-
plexed again, for I neither knew how to grind or
make meal of my corn, or indeed how to clean it,
and part it; nor, if made into meal, how to make
bread of it; and if how to make it, yet I knew not
how to bake it. These things being added to my
desire of having a good quantity for store, and to
secure a constant supply, I resolved not to taste
any of this crop, but to preserve it all for seed
against the next season, and, in the mean time, to
employ all my study and hours of working to accom-
plish this great work of providing myself with corn
and bread.
It might be truly said, that now I worked for my
bread. It is a little wonderful, and what I believe
few people have thought much upon ; viz. the
strange multitude of little things necessary in the
providing, producing, curing, dressing, making, and
nishing this one article of bread.
I, that was reduced to a mere state of nature,
found this to be my daily discouragement, and was
made more and more sensible of it every hour, even
after I had got the rst handful of seed-corn, which,
as I have said, came up unexpectedly, and indeed
to a suprise. _
First, I had no plough to turn up the earth, no
spade or shovel to dig it. Well, this I conquered
by making a wooden spade, as I observed before;
.but this did my work but in a wooden manner: and
though it cost me a great many days to make it,
yet for want of iron it not only wore out the
sooner, but made my work the harder, and made it
be performed much worse.
However, this I bore with, and was content to
work it out with patience, and bear with the bad-
ness of the performance. When the corn was
sowed, I had no harrow ; but was forced to go over
it myself, and drag a great heavy bough of a tree
over it, to scratch the earth, as it maybe called,
rather than rake or harrow it. -
When it was growing and grown, I have observed
already how many things I wanted, to fence it,
secure it, mow or reap it, cure and carry it home,
thresh, part it from the chaff, and save it. Then I
wanted a mill to-~'g1-ind it, sieves to dress it, yeast
and salt to make it into bread, and an oven to bake
it in; and yet all these things '|. did without, as
shall be observed; and yet the corn was an inesti-
mable comfort and advantage to me too. All this, as
I said, made every thing laborious and tedious to
me, but that there was no help for: neither was my
time so much loss to me, because as I had divided
it, a certain part of it was every day appointed to
these works; and, as I resolved to use none of the
corn for bread, till I had a greater quantity by me,
I had the next six months to apply myself wholly
by labour and invention to furnish myself with
utensils proper for the performing all the operations
necessary for the making the corn, when I had it
t for my use.
But, rst, I was to prepare more land, for I had
now seed enough to sow above an acre of ground.
Before I did this, I had a week’s work at least to
make me a spade, which, when it was done, was but
a sorry one indeed, and very heavy, and required
double labour to work with it. However, I went
through that, and sowed my seed in two large at
pieces of ground, as near my house as I could nd
them to my mind, and fenced them in with a good
hedge, the stakes of which were all cut of that
wood which I had set before, which I knew would
grow; so that, in one year’s time, I knew I should
have a quick or living hedge, that would want but
little repair. This work was not so little as to take
me up less than three months, because great part
of that time was of the wet season, when I could
not go abroad. .
Within-doors, that is, when it rained, and I could
not go out, I found employment on the following
occasions; always observing, that all the whilel was
at work, I diverted myself with talking to my par-
rot, and teaching him to speak ; and I quickly
learned him to know his own name, at last, to
speak it out pretty loud, ‘ Poll;’ which was the
rst word I ever heard spoken in the island by any
mouth but my own. This therefore was not my
work, but an assistant to my work; for now, as I
said, I had a great employment upon my hands, as
‘follows, viz. I had long studied, by some means or
other, to make myself some earthen vessels, which
indeed I wanted sorely, but knew not where to
come at them. However, considering the heat of
the climate, 1 did not doubt but, if I could nd out
any such clay, I might botch up sdme such pot, as
might, being dried in the sun, be hard enough, and
strong enough, to bear handling, and -to hold any
thing that was dry, and required to be kept so; and
as this was necessary in preparing corn, meal, &:c.
which was the thing I was upon, I resolved to
make some as large as I could, and t only to stand
like jars to hold what should be put into them.
I It would make the reader pity me, or rather
laugh at mo, to tell how many awkward ways I
took to raise this paste ; what odd, mishapen, ugly
things I made; how many of them fell in, and how
many fell out, the clay not being sti‘ enough to
bear its own weight; how many cracked by the
over-violent heat of the sun, being set out too
hastily; and how many fell to pieces with only re-
moving, as well before as after they were dried:
and, in a word, how, after having laboured hard to
nd the clay, to dig it, to temper it, to bring it
home, and work it, I could not make above two
large, earthen, ugly things, I cannot call them jars,
in about two months’labour.
However, as the sun baked these two very dry
and hard, I lifted them very gently up, and set
them down again in two great wicker-baskets, which
I had made on purpose for them, that they might
not break; and as between the pot and the basket
there was a little room to spare, I stuffed it full of
the rice and barley straw; and these two pots,
being to stand always dry, I thought would hold
my dry corn, and perhaps the meal when the corn
was bruised. ‘ - ' ~
Though I miscarried so much in my design for
large pots, yet I made several smaller things with
better success; such as little round pots, at dishes,
pitchers, and pipkins, and any thing my hand turned
to; and the heat of the sun baked them strangely
hard. ~
But all this would not answer my end, which was
to get an earthen pot to hold what was liquid, and
bear the re, which none of these could do. 'It
happened after some time, making a pretty large
re for cooking my meat, when I went to put it
out, after I had done with it, I found a broken
piece of one of my earthen-ware vessels in the re,
burnt as hard as a stone, and red as a tile. I was
agreeably surprised to see it, and said to myself,
that certainly they might be made to burn whole, if
they would burn broken.
This set me to study how to order my re, so as
to make it burn me some pots. 1 had no notion of a
kiln, such as the potters burn in, or of glazing them
with lead, though I had some lead to do it with;
but I placed three large pipkins, and two or three
pots, in a pile one upon another, and placed my
re-wood all round it with a great heap of embers
under them. I plied the re with fresh fuel round
the outside, and upon the top, till-I saw the pots in
the insidered-hot quite through, and observed that
they did not crack at all. When I saw them clear
red, I let them stand in that heat about ve or six
hours, till I found one of them, though it did not
crack, did melt or run; for the sand which was mix-
ed with the clay melted by the violence of the
heat, and would have run into glass, if l had gone
on; so I slacked my re gradually, till the pots
began to abate of the red colour, and watching
them all night, that I might not let the re abate
too fast, in the morning I had three very good, I
will not say handsome, pipkins, and two other earth-
en pots, as hard burnt as could he desired; and
one of them perfectly glazed with the running of
the sand.
After this experiment, I needunot say that I
wanted no sort of earthen-ware for my use; but I
must needs say, as to the shapes of them, they
were very indifferent, as any one may suppose, when
I had no way of making them, but as the children
make dirt-pies, or as a woman would make pies that
never learnt to raise paste.
No joy at a thing of so mean a nature was ever
equal to mine, when I found I had made an earthen
pot that would bear_ the re; and I had hardly
patience to stay till they were cold, before I set
one upon the fire again,‘ with some water in it, to
boil me some meat, which it did admirably well;
and, with a piece of a kid, I made some very good
broth, though I wanted oatmeal, and several other
ingredients requisite to make it as good as I would
have had it.
My next concern was to get me a stone mortar
to stamp or beat some corn in ; for as to the mill,
there was no thought of arriving to that perfection
of art, with one pair of hands. To supply this want
I was at a great loss; for, of all trades in the
world, I was as perfectly unqualied for a stone*
cutter, as for any whatever: neither had I any
tools to go about it with. I spent many a day to
nd out a great stone big enough to cut hollow,
and make t for a mortar, and could nd none at
all, except what was in the solid rock, and which I
had no way to dig or cut out; nor indeed were
the rocks in the island of hardness sufficient, but
were all of a sandy crumbling stone, which would
neither bear the weight of a heavy pestle, nor
would break the corn without lling it with sand.
So, after a great deal of time lost in searching for
a stone, I gave it over, and resolved to look out a
great block of hard wood, which I found indeed
much easier; and getting one as big as I had
strength to stir, I rounded it, and formed it on the
outside with my axe and hatchet; and then, with
the help of re, and innite labour, made a hol-
low place in it, as the Indians in Brasil make their
canoes. After this, I made a great heavy pestle or
beater, of the wood called the iron-wood, and this
I prepared and laid by against I had my next crop
of corn, when I proposed to myself to grind, or
rather pound, my corn into meal to make my
bread.
~ My next diiculty was to make a sieve, or
searce, to dress my meal, and to part it from the
bran and the husk, without which I did not see it
~possible I could have any bread. This was a-most
diicult thing, so much as but to think on; for, to
be sure, I had nothing like the necessary thing to
make it with, -I mean ne thin canvass, or stuff to
scarce the meal through. _And here I was at a full
stop for many months ; nor did I really know what
to do: linen I had none left, but what was mere
rags. I had goats’ hair, but neither knew I how to
weave or spin it; and had I known how, here were
no tools to work it with: all the remedy that I
found for this, was, that at lastl did remember I
had, among the seamen’s clothes, which were saved
out of the ship, some neckcloths of calico or mus-
lin ; and with some pieces of these I made three
small sieves,‘ but proper enough for the work : and
thus I made shift for some years. How I did.afterl-
wards, I shall show in its place.
The baking part was the next thing to be con-
sidered, and how I should make bread when I
came to"~ have corn; for, rst, I had no yeast. As
to that part, as there was no supplying the want, so
II did not concern myself m-uch about it; but for an
oven, I was indeed in great pain. At length, I
found out an expedient for that also, which was
this: I made some earthen vessels very broad, but
not deep; that is to say, about two feet diameter,
and not above nine inches deep: these I burnt in
the re, as I had done the other, and laid them by,
and when I wanted to bake, I made a great re
upon my hearth, which I had paved with some
square tiles, of my own making and burning also:
but I should not call them square.
I ‘When the re-wood. was burnt pretty much into
embers,_or live coals, I drew them forward upon
this -hearth, so as to cover it all over ; and there I
let them lie, till the hearth was very hot, then
sweeping away all the embers, I set down my loaf
G 2
or loaves, and, whelming down the earthen pot
upon them, drew the embers all round the outside
of the pot, to keep in, and add to the heat; and
thus, as well as in the best oven in the world, I
baked my barley-loaves, and became, in a little
time, a mere pastry-cook into. the bargain; for I
made myself several cakes of the rice, and pud-
dings: indeed I made no pies, neither had I any
thing to put into them, supposing I had, except the
esh either of fowls or goats.
It need not be wondered at, if all these things
took me up most part of the third year of my
abode here; for it is to be observed, that, in the
intervals of these things, I had my new harvest
and husbandry to manage, for I reaped my corn in
its season, and carried it home as well as I could,
and laid it up in the ear, in my large baskets, till I
had time to rub it out; for I had no floor to thresh
it on, or instrument to thresh it with.
And now indeed my stock of corn increasing, I
really wanted to build my barns bigger. I wanted
a place to lay it up in; for the increase of the
corn now yielded me so much, that I had of the
barley about twenty bushels, and of the rice as
much, or more; insomueh that now I resolved to
begin to use it freely, for my bread had been quite
gone a great while; also I resolved to see what
quantity would be sutheient for me a whole year,
and to sow but once a year. '
Upon the whole, I found that the forty bushels
of barley and rice were much more than I could
consume in a year; -so I resolved to sow just the
same quantity every year that l sowed the last, in
hopes that such a quantity would fully provide me
with bread, &c.
All the while these things were doing, you-may
be sure my thoughts ran many times upon the pro-
spect of land, which I had seen from the other
side of the island; and I was not without secret
wishes that ~I were on shore there, faneying that,
seeing the main land, and an inhabited country, I
might nd some way or other to convey myself
farther, and perhaps at last nd some means of
escape.
But all this while I made no allowance for the
dangers of such a condition, and how I might fall
into the hands of savages, and perhaps such as I
might have reason to think far worse than the lions.
and tigers of Africa; that if I once came into their
power, I should run a hazard more than a thousand
to one of being killed, and perhaps of being eaten;
for I had heard, that the people of the Caribbean
coast were cannibals, or men-eaters; and I knew
by the latitude, that I could not be far off from
that shore ; that, suppose they were not cannibals,
yet they might kill me, as many Europeans who
had fallen into their hands had been served, even
when they had been ten or twenty together; much
more I that was but one, and could make little or
no defence. All these things, I say, which I ought
to have considered well of, and did cast up in my
thoughts afterwards, yet took up none of my appre-
hensions at rst; and my head ran mightily upon
the thought of getting over to that shore.
~ Now I wished for my boy Xury, and the longs
boat, with the shoulder-of-mutton sail, with which
I sailed above a thousand miles on the coast of
Africa; but this was in vain. Then I thought I
would go and look at our ship’s boat, which, as I
have said, was blown up upon the shore, a great
way, in the storm, when we were rst cast away.
She lay almost where she did at rst, but not quite;
and was turned, by the force of the waves and the
winds, almost bottom upwards, against a high ridge
of beachy rough sand, but no water about her, as
before.
If I had had hands to have retted her, and to
have launched her into the water, the boat would
have done well enough, and I might have gone
back into thelirasils with her easily enough; but I
might have easily foreseen that I could no more
turn her, and set her upright upon her bottom, than
I could remove the island. However, I. went to
the woods, and cut levers and rollers, and brought
them to the boat, resolved to try hvhat I could do,
suggesting to myself, that if I could but turn her
down, I might’ easily repair the damage she had
received, and she would be a very good boat, and
I might go to sea in her very easily.
I spared no pains indeed in this piece of fruitless
toil, and spent, I think, three or four weeks about
it ; at last, nding it impossible to heave it up with
my little strength, I fell to‘ digging away the sand
to undermine it, and so to make it fall down, set-
ting pieces of wood to thrust and guide it right in
the fall.
But when I had done this, I was unable to stir
it up again, or to get under it, much less to move
it forward towards the water; so I was forced to
give it over: and yet, though I gave over the hopes
of the boat, my desire to venture over for the main
increased, rather than decreased, as the means for it
seemed impossible. _ »
This at length set me upon thinking, whether it
was not possible to make myself a canoe, or peria-
gua, such as the natives of those climates make;
even without tools, or, as I might say, without
hands, viz. of the trunk of a great tree. This I not
only thought possible, but easy; and pleased my-
self extremely with the thoughts of making it, and
with my having much more convenience for it than
any of the -Negroes or Indians, but not at all con—
sidering the particular inconveniences which I lay
under more than the Indians did, viz. want of hands
to move it into the water, when it was made: a
difficulty much harder for me to surmount, than all
the consequences of want of tools could be to them;
for what was it to me, that when I had chosen a
vast tree in the woods, I might with great trouble
cut it down, if after I might be able with my tools
to hew and dub the outside into the proper shape
of a boat, and burn or cut out the inside to make it
hollow, so to make a boat of it, if, after all this, I
must leave it just where I found it, and was not
able to launch it into the water?
One would have thought, I could not have had
thealeast reection upon my mind of my circum-
stance, while I was making this boat, butl should
have immediately thought how I should get it into
the sea; but my thoughts were so intent upon my
voyage over the sea in it, that I never once con-
sidered how I should get it off the land; and it
was really, in its own nature, more easy for me to
guide it over forty-ve miles of sea than about
forty-ve fathom of land, where it lay, to set it
aoat in the water.
I went to work upon this boat the most like a
fool that ever man did, who had any of his senses
awake. I pleased myself with the design, without
determining whether I was ever able to undertake
it: not but that the difficulty of launching my boat
came often into my head ; but I put a stop to my own
inquiries into it, by this foolish answer, which I
gave myself: ‘ Let me rst make it, I'll warrant
I‘ll nd some way or other to get it along, when
it is -done.’ ' ’
e This was a most preposterous method; but the
eagerness ofmy fancy prevailed, and to work I
went, and felled a cedar-t-ree. I question much
whether Solomon ever had such a one for the build-
ing the temple at Jerusalem: it was ve feet ten
inches diameter, at the lower part next the stump,
and four feet eleven inches diameter, at the end of
twenty-two feet; after which, it lessened for a
while, and then parted into branches. It was not
without innite labour that I felled this tree.' I
was twenty days hacking and hewing at it at the
bottom: I was fourteen more getting the branches
and limbs, and the vast spreading head of it cut
off, which I hacked and hewed through with my
axe and hatchet, and inexpressible labour. After
this it cost me a month to shape it, and dub it to a
proportion, and to something like the bottom of a
boat, that it might swim upright as it ought to do.
It cost me near three months more to clear the in-
side, andwork it out so as to make an exactboat of
it. This I did indeed without re, by mere males
let and chisel, and by the dint of hard. labour, till
I had brought it to be a very handsome periagua,
and big enough to have carried six-and-twenty men,
and consequently big enough to have carried me
and all my cargo.
When I had gone through this work, I was ex-
tremely delighted with it. The boat was really
much bigger than I ever saw a canoe, or periagua,
that was made of one tree, in my life: many a
weary stroke it had cost, you may be sure, and there
remained nothing but to get it into the water; and
had I gotten it into the water, I make no question,
but I should~_.have begun the maddest voyage, and
the most unlikely to be performed, that ever was
undertaken. .
But all my devices to get it into the water failed
me, though they cost me innite labour too : it lay
about one hundred yards from the water, and not
more; but the rst inconvenience was, it was up hill
towards the creek. Well, to take away this dis-
couragement, I resolved to dig into the surface of
the earth, and so make a declivity. This I began,
and it cost me a prodigious deal of pains: but
who grudge pains, that have their deliverance in
view? But when this was worked through, and
this difficulty managed, it was still much at one;
for I could no more stir the canoe, than I could
the other boat. =
Then I measured the distance of ground, and
resolved to cut a dock, or canal, to bring the water
up to the canoe, seeing I could not bring the canoe
down to the water. Well, I began this work, and
when.I began to enter into ‘it, and calculated how
deep itwas to be dug,'how broad, how the stuff was to
be thrown out, I found that, by the number of hands
I had, being none but my own, it must have been
ten or twelve years before I should have gone
through with it; for the shore lay high, so that at
the upper end it must have been at least twenty
feet deep; so at length, though with great reluct-
ancy, I gave this attempt over also.
This grieved me heartily; and now I saw. though
too late, the folly of beginning a work before we
count the cost, and before we judge rightly of our
own strength to go through with it.
In the middle of this work, I nished my fourth
year in this place, and kept my anniversary with the
same devotion, and with as much comfort, as ever
before; for by a constant study, and serious appli-
cation of the word of God, and by the assistance
of his grace, I gained a different knowledge from
what I had before. I entertained different notions
of things. I looked now upon the world as a thing
remote, which I had nothing to do with, no expec~
tation from, and indeed no desires about; in a
word, I had nothing indeed to do with it, nor was
ever like to have, so I thought it looked, as we may
perhaps look upon it hereafter, viz. as a place I had
lived in, but was come out of it; and well might I
say, as father Abraham to Dives, ‘Between me and
thee is a great gulfxed.’
In the rst place, I was removed from all the
wickedness of the world here. I had neither the
‘ lust of the flesh, the lust of the eye, nor the pride
of life.’ I had nothing to covet; for I had all I
was now capable of enjoying: 1 was lord of the
whole manor, or, if I pleased, I might call myself
king or emperor over the whole country which I
had possession of. There were no rivals. I had
no competitor, none to dispute sovereignty or com-
mand with me. I might have raised ship~loadings
of corn, but I had no use for it, so I let as little
grow as I thought enough for my occasion. I had
1
tortoises or turtles enough ; but now and then one
was as much as I could put to any use. I had tim-
ber enough to have built a eet of ships. I had
grapes enough to" have made wine, or to have cured
into raisins, to have loaded that eet when they had
been built. ,
But all I could make use of, was all that was
valuable. I had enough to eat, and to supply my
wants, and what was all the rest to me? If I killed
more esh than I could eat, the dog must eat it,‘ or
the vermin ; if I sowed more corn than I could eat,
it must be spoiled. The trees that I cut down
were lying to rot on the ground, I could make no
more use of them than for fuel; and that I hadno
occasion for, but to dress my food. _
In a word, the nature and experience of things
dictated to me, upon just reection, that all the
good things of this world. are no farther good to
us, than they are for our use; and that whatever
we may heap up indeed to give others, we enjoy as
much as we can use, and no more. The most co-
vetous, griping miser in the world would havebeen
cured of the vice of covetousness, if he had been
in my case; for I possessed innitely more than I
knew what to do with. I had no room for desire,
except it was of things which I had not, and they
were but tries, though indeed of great use to me.
I had, as I hinted before, a parcel of money, as well
gold as silver, above thirty-six pounds sterling.
Alas! there the nasty, sorry, useless stuff lay: I had
no manner of business for it; and I often thought
with myself, that I would have given a handful of
it for a gross of tobacco~pipes, or for a hand-1nill.to
grind my corn; nay, I would have given it all for
six—pennyworth of turnip and carrot seed out of
England, or for a handful of peas and beans, and a
bottle of ink. As it was, I had not the least _ad-
vantage by it,.or benet from it.; but there it lay in
a-drawer, and grew mouldy with the damp of the
cave, in the wet season: and if I had had the
drawer full of diamonds, it had been the same case ;
and they had been of no manner of value to me,
because of no use.
I had now brought my state of life to be much
easier in itself than it was at rst, and much easier
to my mind, as well as to my body. I frequently
sat down to my meat with thankfulness, and ad-
mired the hand of God’s providence, which had thus
spread my table in the wilderness. I learned to look
more upon the bright side of my condition, and less
upon the dark side, and to consider what I enjoyed
rather than what I wanted; and this gave me some-
times such secret comforts, that I cannot express
them, and which I take notice of here to put those
discontented people in mind of it, who cannot eu-
joy comfortably what God has given them, because
they see and covet something that he has not given
them. All our discontents about what we want,
appeared to me to spring from the want of thankful-
ness for what we have.
Another reection was of great use to me, and
doubtless would be so to any one that should fall
into such distress as mine was; and this was to
compare my present condition with what I at rst
expected it should be; nay, with what it would cer-
taiul y have been, if the good providence of God had
not wonderfully ordered the ship to be cast up
nearer to the shore, where I not only could come at
her, but could bring what I got out of her to the
shore, for my relief and comfort, without which I
had wanted tools to work, weapons for defence, or
gunpowder and shot for getting my food.
I spent whole hours, I may say, whole days, in
representing to myself, in the most lively colours,
how 1 must have acted, if I. had got nothing out of
the ship ; how, I could not have so much as got any
food, except sh and turtles; and that, as it was
long before I found any of them, I must have pe-
rished rst ; that I should have lived, if I had not
perished, like a mere savage ; that if I had killed a
goat‘ or a fowl, by any contrivance, I had no way
to ay or open them, or part the esh from the skin
and the bowels, or to cut it up, but must gnaw it
with my teeth, and pull it with my claws, like a
beast.
These reections made me very sensible of the
goodness of Providence to me, and very thankful
for my present condition, with all its hardships and
misfortunes : and this part also 1 cannot but recom-
mend to the reection of those who are apt in their
misery to say, ‘ Is any aiiliction like mine?’ Let
them consider how much worse the cases of some
people are, and their ‘case might have been, il’ Pro-
vidence had thought t.
» I had another reection which assisted me also to
comfort my mind with hopes; and this was com-
paring my present condition with what I had de-
served, and had therefore reason to expect from the
hand of Providence. I had lived a dreadful life,
perfectly destitute of the knowledge and fear of
God. I had been well instructed by father and mo-
ther; neither had they been wanting to me in their
early endeavoursto infuse a religious awe of God
into my mind, a sense of my duty, and of what the
nature and end of my being required of me. But,
alas ! falling early into the sea-faring life, which, of
all lives, is the most destitute of the fear of God,
though his terrors are always before them; I say,
falling early into the sea-faring life, and into sea-
faring company, all that little sense of religion
which I had entertained, was laughed out of me by
my messmates ; by a hardened despising of dangers,
and the views of death, which grew habitual to me;
by my long absence from all manner of opportuni-
ties to converse with any thing but what was like
myself, or to hear any thing that was good, or
tended towards it.
So void was I of every thing that was good, or of
the least sense of what I was, or was to be, that in
the greatest deliverances I enjoyed, such as my
escape from Sallee, my being taken up by the Por-
tuguese master of the ship, my being planted so
well in the Brasils, my receiving the cargo from
England, and the like, I never once had the words
‘ Thank God’ so much as on my mind, or in my
-mouth; nor in the greatest distress had I so much
thought as to pray to him; nor so much as to
say, ‘ Lord, have mercy upon me!’ no, nor to men-
tion the name of God, unless it was to swear by, and
blaspheme it. _
I had terrible reections upon my mind for many
months, as I have already observed, on the account
of my wicked and hardened life past; and when I
looked about me, and considered what particular
provide-nces had attended me since my coming into
this place, and how God had dealt bountifully with
me; had notonly punished me less than my ini-
quity deserved, but had so plentifully provided for
me: this gave me great hopes, that my repentance
was accepted, and that God had yet mercies in store
for me.
With these reections I worked my mind up, not
only to resignation to the will of God, inthe pre-
sent disposition of my circumstances, but even to a
sincere thankfulness for my condition, and that I,
who was yet. a living man, ought not to complain,
seeing I had not the due punishment of my sins ;
that I enjoyed so many mercies which I had no
reason to have expected in that place, that I ought
never more to repine at my condition, but to re»
joice, and to give daily thanks, for that daily bread,
which nothing but a crowd of wonders could have
brought; that I ought to consider Iliad been fed
even by a miracle, even as great as that of feeding
Elijah by ravens, nay, by a long series of miracles ;
and that I could hardly have named a place in the
uninhabited part-of the world where I could have
been cast more to my advantage: a place where, as
I had no society, which was my afiction on one
hand, so I found no ravenous beasts, no furious
wolves or tigers, to threaten my life ; no venomous
creatures or poisonous, which I might have fed" on
to my hurt, no savages to murder and devour me.
In a word, as my life was a life of sorrow one
way, so it was a life of mercy another; and lwanted
nothing to make it a life of comfort, but to be able
to make my sense of Go'd’s goodness to me, and
care over me in this condition, my daily consolation:
and after I made a just improvement of these things,
I went away, and was no more sad.
I had now been here so long, that many things
which I brought on shore for my help were either
quite gone, or very much wasted, and near spent.
My ink, as I observed, had been gone for some
time, all but a very little, which I eked out with
water a little and a little, till it was so pale it scarce
left any appearance of black upon the paper. As
long as it lasted, I made use of it to minute down
the days of the month on which any remarkable
thing happened to me: and rst, by casting up
times past, 1 remember that there was a strange
concurrence of days, in the various providences
which befell me, and which, if I had been supersti-
tiously inclined to observe days as fatal or fortun-
ate, I might have had reason to have looked upon
with a great deal of curiosity.
First, I had observed that the same day that I
broke away from my father and my friends, and ran
away to Hull, in order to go sea, the same day after-
wards I was taken by the Sallee man of war, and
made a slave.
The same day of the year that I escaped out of
the wreck of that ship in Yarmouth roads, that same
day of the year afterwards I made my escape from
Sallee in the boat. I
The same day of the year I was born on, viz. the
30th of September, the same day I had my life so
miraculously saved twenty-six years after, when I
was cast on shore in this island : so that my wicked
life, and solitary life, began both on a day.-
The next thing to my ink's being wasted, was
that of my bread, I mean the biscuit which I brought
out of the ship. This I had husbanded to the last
degree, allowing myself but one cake of bread a
day, for above a year; and yet I was quite without
bread, for near a year, before I got any coru of my
own: and great reason I had to be thankful that I
had any at all, the getting it being, as has been
already observed, next to miraculous.
My clothes too began to decay mightily. As to
linen, I had none a good while, except some check
shirts which I found in the chests of the other sea-
men, and which I carefully preserved, because many
times I could bear no other clothes on but a shirt;
and it was a very great help to me that l had
among all the men's clothes of the ship almost
three dozen of shirts. There were also several thick
watch-coats of the seamen, which were left indeed,
but they were too hot to wear; and though it is
true, that the weather was so violent hot, that there
was no need of clothes, yet I could not go quite
naked, no, though I had been inclined to it, which I
was not, nor could l abide the thoughts of it, though
I was all alone.
One reason why I could not go quite naked, was,
I could not bear the heat of the sun so well when
quite naked, as with some clothes on, nay, the very
heat frequently blistcred my skin; whereas, with a
shirt on, the air itself made some motion, and
whistling under that shirt, was twofold cooler than
without it. No more could I ever bring myself to
go out in the heat of the sun without a cap or a
hat, the heat of the sun beating with such violence
as it does in that place, would give me the head-
ach presently, by darting so directly on my head,
without a cap or a hat on, so that I could not bear
it; whereas, if I put on my hat, it would presently
go away.
Upon these views I began to consider about put-
ting the few rags I had, which I called clothes, into
some order. I had worn out all the waistcoats I
had, and my business was now to try if I could not
make jackets out of the great watch-coats which I
had by me, and with such other materials as I had;
so I set to work a tailoring, or rather indeed a
botching, for I made most piteous work of it.
However, I made shift to make two or three new
waistcoats, which I hoped would serve me a_ great
while; as for breeches or drawers, I made but very
sorry shift indeed, till afterwards.
I have mentioned that I saved the skins of all
the creatures that I killed, I mean the four-footed
ones ; and I had hung them up stretched out with
sticks in the sun, by which means some of them
were so dry and hard, that they were t for little,
but others were very useful. The rst thing I made
of these was a great cap for my head, with the hair
on the outside to shoot o? the rain; and this I per-
formed so well, that, after this, I made me a suit of
clothes, wholly of those skins; that is to say, a
waistcoat and breeches, open at knees, and both
loose; for they were rather wanting to keep me
cool, than to keep me warm. I must not omit to
acknowledge, that they were wretchedly made; for
if Irwas a bad carpenter, I was a worse tailor.
I-Iowever, they were such as I made a very good
shift with, and when I was abroad, if it happened
to rain, _the hair of the waistcoat and cap being out-
most, I was kept very dry. I
‘After this I spent a great deal of time and pains
to make me an umbrella: I was indeed in great
want of one, and had a great mind to make one. I
had seen them made in the Brasils, where they are
very useful in the great heats which are there; and
I‘ felt the heats every jot as great here, and greater
too, being nearer the equinox; besides, as I was
obliged to be much abroad, it was a most useful
thing to me, as well for the rains as the heats. I
took a world of pains at it, and was a great while
before I could make any thing likely to hold 3 nay,
after I thought I had hit the way, I spoiled two or
three before I made one to my mind: but, at last,
I made one that answered indierently well. The
main dilliculty I found was to make it to let down.
I could make it to spread; but if it did not let
down too, and draw in, it would not be portable for
me any way butjust over my head, which would
not do. Ilowever, at last, as I said, I made one to
answer: I covered it with skins, the hair upwards,
so that it cast off the rain like a penthouse, and
kept off the sun so effectually, that I could walk
out in the hottest of the weather, with greater ad-
vantage than I could before in the coolest; and
when I had no need of it, I could close it, and carry
it under my arm.
Thus I lived mighty comfortably, my mind being
entirely composed, by resigning to the will of God,
and throwing myself wholly upon the disposal of
his providence. This made my life better than so-
ciable ; for when I began to regret the want of con-
versation, I would ask myself, whether thus convers-
ing mutually with my own thoughts, and, as I hope
I may say, with even my Maker, by ejaculations and
petitions, was not better than the utmost enjoyment
of human society in the world?
I cannot say that after this, for five years, any ex-
traordinary thing happened to me; but I lived on
in the same course, in the same posture and place,
just as before. The chief thing I was employed in,
besides my yearly labour of planting my barley and
rice, and curing my raisins, of both which I always
kept up just enough to have sufficient stock of one
year’s provisions before-hand; I say, besides this
yearly labour, and my daily labour of going out
with my gun, I had one labour to make me a canoe,
which at last I nished. So that by digging a canal
to it six feet wide, and four feet deep, I brought it
into the creek, almost half a mile. As for the rst,
that was so vastly big, as I made it without con-
sidering before-hand, as I ought to do, how I should
be able to launch it; s'o never being able to bring it
to the water, or bring the water to it, I was obliged
to let it lie where it was, as a memorandum to teach
me to be wiser next time. Indeed the next time,
though I could not get a tree proper for it, and was
in a place where I could not get the water to it, at
any less distance than, as I have said, of near half
a mile, yet as I saw it was practicable at last, I
never gave it over; and thou h I was near two
years about it, yet I never grudged my labour, in
hopes of having a boat to go off to sea in at last.
However, though my little periagua was nished,
yet the size of it was not at all answerable to the
design which I had in view, when I made the rst ;
I mean of venturing over to the terra rma, where
it was above forty miles broad: accordingly, the
smallness of my boat assisted to put an end to that
design, and now I thought no more of it. But as I
had a boat, my next design was to make a tour
round the island; for as I had been on the other
side, in one place, crossing, as I have already de-
scribed it,'over the land, so the discoveries I made
in that journey, made me very eager to see other
parts of the coast; and now I had a boat, I thought
of nothing but sailing round the island.
For this purpose, and that I might do every thing
with discretion and consideration, I tted up a little
mast to my boat, and made a sail to it out of some
of the pieces of the ship's sails, which lay in store,
and of which I had a great stock by me.
Having tted my mast and sail, and tried the boat,
I found she would sail very well. Then I made
little lockers or boxes at either end of my boat, to
put provisions, necessaries, and ammunition, &:c.
into, to be kept dry, either from rain, or the spray
of the sea, and a little long hollow place I cut in
the inside of the boat, where l could lay my gun,
making a ap to hang down over it to keep it dry.
I xed my umbrella also in a step at the stern,
like a mast, to stand over my head, and keep the
heat of the sun o‘ me, like an awning; and thus
1 every now and then took a little voyage upon the
sea, but never went far out, nor far from the little
creek; but at last, being eager to view the circum-
ference of my little kingdom, I resolved upon my
tour, and accordingly I victualled my ship for the
voyage, putting in two dozen of my loaves (cakes
I should rather call them) of barley bread, an earth-
en pot full of parched rice, a food I eat a great
deal of, a little bottle of rum, half a goat, and
powder and shot for killing more, and two large
watch-coats, of those which, as I mentioned before,
I had saved out of the seamen’s chests; these I
took, one to lie upon, and the other to cover me in
the night.
It was the 6th of November, in the sixth year of
my reign, or my captivity, which you please, that I
set out on this voyage, and I found it much longer
than I expected; for though the island itself was
not very large, yet when I came to the east side of
it, I found a great ledge of rocks lie out above two
leagues into the sea, some above water, some under
it; and beyond that a shoal of sand, lying dry, half
a league more, so that I was obliged to go a great
way out to sea to double that point.
When I rst discovered them, I was going to give
over my enterprise, and come back, not knowing
how far it might oblige me to go out to sea, and,
above all, doubting how I should get back again ; so
I came to anchor, for I had made me a kind of an
anchor, with a piece of a broken grappling, which I
got out of the ship.
I-Iaving secured my boat, I took my gun, and went
on shore, climbing upon a hill, which seemed to
overlook that point, where I saw the full extent of
it, and resolved to venture.
In my viewing the sea from that hill where I
stood, I perceived a strong, and, indeed, a most
furious current, which ran to the east, and even
came close to the point; and I took the more no-
II
tice of it, because I saw there might be some dan-
ger, that when I came into it, I might be carried
out to sea by the strength of it, and not be able to
make the island again. And indeed, had I not got-
ten rst up upon this hill, I believe it would have
been so; for there was the same current on the
other side of the island, only that it set off at a
farther distance, and I saw there was a strong eddy
under the shore; so I had nothing to do but to get
in out of the rst current, and I should presently
be in an eddy.
I lay here, however, two days; because the wind,
blowing pretty fresh (at E. S. E. and that being
just contrary to the said current), made a great
breach of the sea upon the point; so that it was
not safe for me to keep too close to the shore for
the breach, nor to go too far off because of the
stream.
The third day in the morning, the wind having
abated over night, the sea was calm, and I ven-
tured; but I am a warning-piece again to all rash
and ignorant pilots; for no sooner was I come to the
point, when even I was not my boat’s length from
the shore, but I found myself in a great depth of
water, and a current like the sluice of a mill. It
carried my boat along with it with such violence,
that all I could do, could not keep her so much as
on the edge of it; but I found it hurried me far-
ther and farther out from the eddy, which was on
the left hand. There was no wind stirring to help
me, and all thatl could do with my paddles signied
nothing: and now I began to give myself over for
lost; for, as the current was on both sides the island,
I knew in a few leagues distance they must. join
again, and then I was irrecoverably gone, nor did I
see any possibility of avoiding it; so that I had no
prospect before me but of perishing, not by the sea,
for that was calm enough, but of starving for hun-
ger. I had indeed found a tortoise on the shore, as
big almost as I could lift, and had tossed it into the
boat; and 1 had a great jar of fresh water, that is
to say, one of my earthen pots: but what was all
this to being driven into the vast ocean, where, to be
sure, there was no shore, no main land or island, for
a thousand leagues at least? i
And now I saw how easy it was for the providence
of God to make the most miserable condition that
mankind could be in, worse. Now I looked back
upon my desolate solitary islarrd, as the most plea-
sant place in the world; and all the happiness my
heart could wish for, was to be but there again. I
stretched out my hands to it with eager wishes. ‘ O
happy desert,’ said I, ‘ I shall never see thee more!
0 miserable creature,’ said I, ‘ whither am I going?’
Then I reproached myself with my unthankful tem-
per, and how I had repined at my solitary con-
dition, and now what would I give to be on shore
there again? Thus we never see the true state of
our condition, till it is illustrated to us by its con-
traries ; nor know how to value what we enjoy, but
by the want of it. It is scarce possible to imagine
the consternation I was now in, being driven from
my beloved island (for so it appeared to me now to
be) into the wide ocean, almost two leagues, and in
the utmost despair of ever recovering it again.
However, 1 worked hard, till indeed my strength
was almost exhausted, and kept my boat as much to
the northward, that is, towards the side of the cur-
rent which the eddy lay on, as possibly I could.
When about noon, as the sun passed the meridian, I
thought I felt a little breeae of wind in my face,
springing up from the S. S. E. This cheered my
heart a little, and especially when in about half an
hour more it blew a pretty small gentle gale. By
this time I was gotten at a frightful distance from
the island, and had the least cloud or hazy weather
intervened, I had been undone another way. too; for
I had no compass on board, and should never have
known how to have steered towards the island. if I
had but once lost sight of it: but the weather con-
tinuing clear, I applied myself to get up my mast
again, and spread my sail, standing away to the
north, as much as possible, to get out of the cur-
rent.
Just as I had set my mast and sail, and the boat
began to stretch away, I saw, even by the clearncss
of the water, some alteration of the current was
near; for where the current was so strong, the
water was foul; but perceiving the water clear, I
found the current abate, and presently I found to
the east, at about halfa mile, a breach of the sea
upon some rocks; these rocks I found caused the
current to part again, and as the main stress of it
ran away more southerly, leaving the rocks to the
north-east, so the other returned by the repulse of
the rock, and made a strong" eddy, which ran back
again to the north-west, with a very sharp stream.
They who know what it is to have a reprieve
brought to them upon the ladder, or to be rescued
from thieves just going to murder them, or who
have been in such-like extremities, may guess what
my present surprise ofjoy was, and how gladly I
put my boat into the stream of this eddy; and,
the wind also freshening, how gladly I spread my
sail to it, running cheerfully before the wind, and
with a strong tide or eddy under foot.
This eddy carried me about a league in my way
back again, directly towards the island, but about
two leagues more towards the northward than the
current lay, which carried me away at rst; so that
when I came near the island, I found myself open
to the northern shore of it, that is to say, the
other end of the island, opposite to that which I
went out from.
When I had made something more than a league
of way, by the help of this current or eddy, 1 found
it was spent, and served me no farther. However,
I found that being between the two great currents,
viz. that on the south side, which had hurried mo
away, and that on the north, which lay about two
leagues on the other side; I say, between these
two, in the west of the island, 1 found the water at
least still, and running no way; and having still a
breeze of wind fair for me, I kept on steering di-
rectly for the island, though not making such fresh
way as I did before.
About four o’clock in the evening, being then
within about a league of the island, I found.the
point of the rocks which occasioned this disaster
stretching out, as is described before, to the south-
ward, and casting o the current more southwardly,
had, of course, made another eddy to the north;
and this I found very strong, but not directly set-
ting the way my course lay, which was due west, but
almost full north. However, having a fresh gale, I
stretched across this eddy, slanting north-west, and
in about an hour came within a mile of the shore,
where, it being smooth water, I soon got to land.
When I was on shore, I fell on my knees, and
gave God thanks for my escape, resolving to lay
aside all thoughts of m"y deliverance by my boat;
and refreshing myself with such things as I had, I
brought my boat close to the shore, in a little cove
that I had e-spied under some trees, and laid me
down to sleep, being quite spent with the labour
and fatigue of the voyage.
I was now at a great loss which way to get home
with _my boat. I had run so much hazard, and
knew too much the case, to think of attempting it
by the way I went out; and what might be at the
other side (I mean the west side), I knew not,-nor
had I any mind to run any more ventures : so I
only resolved in the morning to make my way west-
ward along the shore, and to see if there was no
creek, where I might lay up my frigate in safety, so
as to have her again, if I wanted her. In about
three miles, or thereabouts, coasting the shore, I
came to a very good inlet, or bay, about a mile
over, which narrowed till it came to a very little
rivulet or brook, where I found a convenient har-
bour for my boat, and where she lay as if she had
been in a little dock made on purpose for her:
here I put in, and having stowed my boat very safe,
I went on shore to look about me, and see where
I was.
I soon found I had but a little passed by the
place whore I had been before, when I travelled on
foot. to that shore; so taking nothing out of my
boat, but my gun and my umbrella, for it was ex-
ceeding hot, I began my march. The way was com-
fortable enough after such a voyage as I had been
upon, and I reached my old bower in the evening,
where I found every thing standing as I left it; for
I always kept it in good order, being, as I said be-
fore, my country house.
‘1 got over the fence, and laid me down in the
shade to rest my limbs; for I was very weary, and
fell asleep. But judge you, if you can, that read
my story, what surprise I must be in, when I was
awaked out of my sleep, by a voice calling me by
my name several times, "' Robin, Robin, Robin
Crusoe! poor Robin Crusoe I Where are you, Ro-
bin Crusoe? Where are you? Where have you
been ?’
I was so dead asleep at rst, being fatigued with
rowing, or paddling as it is called, the rst part of
the day, and with walking the latter part, that I did
not awake thoroughly, and dozing, between sleeping
and waking, thought I dreamed that somebody
spoke to me. But as the voice continued to repeat
‘ Robin Crusoe! Robin Crusoe!’ at last I began to
awake more perfectly, and was at rst dreadfully
frighted, and started up in the utmost conster-
nation. But no sooner were my eyes open, but I
saw my Poll sitting on the top of the hedge, and
immediately knew that it was he that spoke to me;
for just in such bemoaniug language I had used to
talk to him, and teach him ; and he had learned it
so perfectly, that he would sit upon my nger, and
lay his bill close to my face, and cry, ‘ Poor Robin
Crusoe! Where are you? Where have you been?
Ilow came you here?’ and such things as I had
taught him.
However, even though I knew it was the parrot,
and that indeed it could be nobody else, it was a
good while before I could compose myself. First, I
was amazed how the creature got thither, and then
how he should just keep about the place, and no
where else. But as I was well satised it could be
nobody but honest Poll, I got over it; and holding
out my hand, and calling him by his name,‘ Poll,’
the sociable creature came to me, and sat upon my
thumb, as he used to do, and continued talking to
me, ‘ Poor Robin Crusoe!’ and how did I come
here, and where had I been, just as if he had been
overjoyed to see me again; and so I carried him
home along with me.
I had now had enough of rambling to sea for
some time, and had enough to do for many days to
sit still, and reect upon the dangerl had been in.
I would have been very glad to have had my boat
again on my side of the island; but I knew not how
it was practicable to get it about. As to the east
side of the island, which I had gone round, 1 knew
well enough there was no venturing that way: my
very heart would shrink, and my very blood run
chill, but to think of it. And as to the other side
of the island, I did not know how it might be
there ; but supposing the current ran with the
same force against the shore at the east, as it passed
by it on the other, I might run the same risk of
being driven down the stream, and carried by the
island, as 1 had been before of being carried away
from it ; so with these thoughts I contented myself
to be without any boat, though it had been the
product of so many months‘ labour to make it, and
of so many more to get it into the sea.
In this government of my temper I remained near
a year, lived a very sedate, retired life, as you may
wcll suppose: and my thoughts being very much
composed as to my condition, and fully comforted
in resigning myself to the dispositions of Provi-
dence, I thought I lived really very happily in all
things, except that of society.
I improved myself in this time in all the me-
chanic exercises which my necessities put me upon
applying myself to; and, I believe, could, upon
occasion, have made a very good carpenter, espe-
cially considering how few tools I had.
Besides this, I arrived at an unexpected perfec-
tion in my earthen-ware, and contrived well enough
to make them with a wheel, which I found innitely
easier and better; because I made things round and
shapeable, which before were lthy things indeed to
look on. But I think I never was more vain of my
own performance, or more joyful for any thing I
found out, than for my being able to make a to-
bacco-pipe; and though it was a very ugly, clumsy
thing, when it was done, and only burnt red like
other earthen-ware, yet, as it was hard and firm, and
would draw the smoke, I was exceedingly com-
forted with it; for I had been always used to
smoke, and there were pipes in the ship, but I
forgot them at rst, not knowing that there was
tobacco in the island; and afterwards, when I
searched the ship again, I could not come at any
pipes at all.
In my wicker-ware I also improved _much, and
made abundance of necessary baskets, as well as my
invention showed me, though not very handsome,
yet they were such as were very handy and con-
venient for my laying things up in, or fetching
things home in. For example, if I killed a goat
abroad, I could hang it up in a tree, ay it, and
dress it, and cut it in pieces, and bring it home in
a basket; and the'likc by a turtle, I could cut it
up, take out the eggs, and a piece or two of the
esh, which was enough for me, and bring them
home in a basket, and leave the rest behind me.
Also large deep baskets were iny receivers for my
corn, which I always rubbed out as soon as it was
dry and cured; and kept it in great baskets, instead
of a granary.
I began now to perceive my powder abated con-
siderably, and this was a want which it was impos-
sible for me to supply, and I began seriously to
consider what I must do when I should have no
more powder; that iss to say, how I should do to
kill any goats. I had, as I observed in the third
year of my being here, kept a young kid, and bred
her up tame. I was in hopes of getting a he-kid;
but I could not, by any means, bring it to pass, till
my kid grew an old goat, and I could never nd
in my heart to kill her, till she died at last of mere
age.
But, being now in the eleventh year of my resi-
dence, and, as I have said, my ammunition growing
low, I set myself to study‘ some art to trap and
snare the goats, to see whether I could not catch
some of them alive; and particularlyl wanted a she-
goat great with young.
To this purpose I made snares to hamper them,
and I do believe they were more than once taken in
them; but my tackle was not good, for I had no
wire, and I always found them broken, and my bait
devoured.
At length I resolved to try a pit-fall; so I dug
several large pits in the earth, in places where I had
observed the goats used to feed, and over these pits
I placed hurdles of my own making too, with a
great weight upon them; and several times I put
ears of barley and dry rice, without setting the
trap, and I could easily perceive that the goats had
gone in, and eaten up the corn, for 1 could see the
mark of their feet. At length, I set three traps in
one night, and, going the next morning, I found
them all standing, and yet the bait eaten and gone.
This was very discouraging: however, I altered
my traps; and, not to trouble you with particulars,
going one morning to see my traps, I found in one
H 2
of them a large old he-goat, and, in one of the
others, three kids, a male and two females.
As to the old one, 1 knew not what to do with
him: he was so erce I durst not go into the pit
to him; that is to say, to go about to bring him
away alive, which was what l wanted. I could
have killed him, -but that was not my business, nor
would it answer my end; so I even let him out,
and he ran away as if he had been frighted out of
his wits; but I had forgot then, what I learned
afterwards, that hunger will tame a lion. If 1 had
let him stay there three or four days without food,
and then have carried him some water to drink, and
then a little corn, he would have been as tame as
one of the kids; for they are mighty sagacious,
tractable creatures, when they are well used.
I-Iowever, for the present I let him go, knowing
no better at that time; then I went to the three
kids, and, taking them one by one, I tied them with
strings together, and with some diiculty brought
them all home.
It was a good while before they would feed; but
throwing them some sweet corn, it tempted them,
and they began to be tame. And now I found,
that if I expected to supply myself with goat-esh,
when I had no powder or shot left, breeding
seine up tame was my only way, when perhaps I
might have them about my house like a ock of
sheep.
But then it presently occurred to me, that I must
keep the tame from the wild, or else they would
always run wild when they grew up ; and the only
way for this was to have some enclosed piece of
ground, well fenced either with hedge or pale, to
keep them up so eilectually, that those within
might not break out, or those without break in.
This was a great undertaking for one pair of
hands; yet, as I saw there was an absolute neces-
sity of doing it, my rst piece of work was to nd
out a proper piece.-of ground ; viz. where there was
llkel y to be herbage for them to eat, water for them
to drink, and cover to keep them from the sun.
Those who understand such enclosures will think
I had very little contrivance, when I pitched upon
a place very proper for all these, being a plain open
piece of meadow land, or savanna (as our people
call it in the western colonies), which had two or
threelittle drills of fresh water in it, and at one
end was very woody; I say, they will smile at my
forecast, when I shall tell them I began my enclos-
ing of this piece of ground in such a manner, that
my hedge or pale must have been, at least two
miles about :, nor was the madness of it so great as
to the compass; for if it was ten miles about, I
was like to have time enough to do it in, but I did
not consider that my goats would be as wild in so
much compass, as if they had had the whole island;
and I should have so much room to chase them in,
that I should never catch them.
My hedge was begun and carried on, I believe,
about fty yards, when this thought occurred to
me; so I presently stopped short, and, for the rst
beginning, I resolved to enclose a piece of about
one hundred and fty yards in length, and one hun-
dred yards in breadth, which, as it would maintain
as many as I should have in any reasonable time,
so, as my flock increased, I could add more ground
to my enclosure.
This was acting with some prudence, and I went
to work with courage. I was about three months
hedging in the first piece, and, till I had done. it, I
tethered the three kids in the best part of it, and
used them to feed as near me as possible, to make
them familiar ; and very often 1 would go and carry
them some ears of barley, or a handful of rice, and
feed them out of my hand, so that, after my enclo-
sure was nishcd, and I let them loose, they would
follow me up and down, bloating after me for a
handful of corn.
This answered my end, and in about a year and a
half I had a ock of about twelve goats, kids and
all; and in two years more I had three-and-forty,
besides several that I took and killed for my food:
and after that I enclosed ve several pieces of
ground to feed them in, with little pens to drive
them into, to take them as I wanted them; and
gates out of one piece of ground into another.
But this was not all; for now I not only_ had
goat’s esh to feed on when I pleased, but milk too;
a thing which indeed in the beginning I did not so
much as think of, and which, when it came into
my thoughts, was really an agreeable surprise: for
now I set "up my dairy, and had sometimes a gallon
or two of milk in a day. And as nature, who gives
supplies of food to every creature, dictates even
naturally how to make use of it; so I, that never
milked a cow, much less a goat, or saw butter or
cheese made, very readily and handily, though after
a great many essays and miscarriages, made me
both butter and cheese at last, and never wanted it
afterwards.
How mercifully can our great Creator treat his
creatures, even in those conditions in which they
seemed to be overwhelmed in destruction! I-Iow
can he sweeten the bitterest providences, and give
us cause to praise him for dungeons and prisons!
What a table was here spread for me in a wilder-
ness, where I saw nothing at rst but to perish for
hunger!
It would have made a Stoic smile to have see-u
me and my little family sit down to dinner. There
was my majesty, the prince and lord of the whole
island. I had the lives of all my subjects at my
absolute command: I could hang, draw, give
liberty, and take it away, and no rebels among all
my subjects.
Then to see how like a king I dined too, all
alone, attended by my servants ! Poll, as if he had
been my favourite, was the only person permitted
to talk to me: my dog, who was now grown very
old and crazy, and had found no species to multiply
his kind upon, sat always at my right hand; and
two cats, one on one side the table, and one on the
other, expecting now and then a bit from my hand,
as a mark of special favour.
But these were not the two cats which I brought
on shore at rst; for they were both of them dead,
and had been interred near my habitation by my
own hands; but one of them having multiplied by
I know not what kind of creature, these were two
which I had preserved tame, whereas the rest ran
wild in the woods, and became indeed troublesome
to me at last; for they would often come into my
house, and plunder me too, till at last I was obliged
to shoot them, and kill a great many; at length
they left me with this attendance. And in this plen-
tiful manner I lived; neither could I be said to
want any thing but society, and of that, in some
time after this, I was like to have too much.
I was something impatient, as I before observed,
to have the use of my boat, though very loath to
run any more hazards ; and therefore sometimes I
sat contriving ways to get her about the island, and
at other times I sat myself down contented enough
without her. But I had a strange uneasiness in
my mind to go down to the point of the island,
where, as I have said, in my last ramble, I went
up the hill to see how the shore lay, and how the
current set, that I might see what I had to do.
This inclination increased upon me every day, and
at length I resolved to travel thither by land; and
following the edge of the shore, I did so: but had
any one in England been to meet such a man as I
was, it must either have frighted him, or raised a
great deal of laughter; and as I frequently stood
still to look at myself, I could not but smile at the
notion of my travelling through Yorkshire with
such an equipage, and in such a dress. Be pleased
to take a sketch of my gure as follows:
I had a great, high, shapeless cap, made of a
goat's skin, with a ap hanging down behind, as
well to keep the sun from me, as to shoot the rain
off from running into my neck ;. nothing being so
hurtful in these climates, as the rain upon the esh
under the clothes.
I had a short jacket of goat’s skin, the skirts
coming down to about the middle of my thighs;
and a pair of open-knee’d breeches of the same:
the breeches were made of the skin of an old he-
goat, whose hair hung down such a length on either
side, that, like pantaloons, it reached to the middle of
my legs. Stockings and shoes I had none; but I had
made me a pair of something, I scarce knew what
to call them, like buskins, to ap over my legs, and
lace on either side like spatterdashes, but of a
most barbarous shape, as indeed were all the rest of
my clothes. _
I had on a broad belt of goat's skin dried, which
I drew together with two thongs of the same, in-
stead of buckles; and, in a kind of a frog, on either
side of this, instead of a sword and a dagger, hung-
a little saw and a hatchet, one on one side, one on
the other. I had another belt not so broad, and
fastened in the same manner, which hung over my
shoulder; and at the end of it, under my left arm,
hung two pouches, both made of goat’s skin too:
in one of which hung my powder, in the other my
shot. At my back I carried my basket, on my
shoulder my gun, and over my head a great,clumsy,
ugly, goat-skin umbrella, but which, after all, was
the most necessary thing I had about me, next to
my gun. As for my face, the colour of it was really
not so Mulatto-like as one might expect from a
man not at all careful of it, and living within nine
or ten degrees of the equinox. My beard'I had
once suffered to grow till it was about a quarter of
a yard long; but as I had both scissars and razors
sufficient, I had cut it pretty short, except what
grew on my upper lip, which I had trimmed into a
large pair of Mahometan whiskers, such as I had
seen worn by some Turks, whom I saw at Sallee;
for the Moors did not wear such, though the Turks
did. Of these mustachioes, or whiskers, I will not
say they were long enough to hang my hat upon
them; but they were of a length and shape mon-
strous enough, and such as in England would have
passed for frightful.
But all this is by the bye: for as to my gure, I
had so few to observe me, that it was of no manner
of consequence; so I say no more to that part.
In this kind of gure I went my new journey, and
was out ve or six days. I travelled rst along the
sea-shore, directly to the place where I rst brought
my boat to anchor, to get up upon the rocks;
and, having no boat now to take care of, I went
over the land a nearer way, to the same height that
I was upon before, when looking forward to the
point of the rocks which lay out, and which I was
to double with my boat, as I said above, I was
surprised to see the sea all smooth and quiet: no
rippling, no motion, no current, any more there
than in other places.
I was at a strange loss to understand this, and
resolved to spend some time in observing it, to see
if nothing from the sets of the tide had occasioned
it. But I was presently convinced how it was, viz.
that the tide of ebb setting from the west, andjoin-
ing with the current of waters from some great
river on the shore, must be the occasion _of this cur-
rent; and that, according as the wind blew more
forcibly from the west, or from the north, this cur-
rent came near, or went farther from the shore; for,
waiting thereabouts till evening, I went up to the
rock again, and then the tide of ebb being made,
I plainly saw the current again as before, only that
it ran farther off, being nearhalf a league from the
shore; whereas, in my case, it set close upon the
shore, and hurried me in my canoe along with it,
which at another time it would not have done.
‘I his observation convinced me, that I had nothing
to do but to observe the ebbing and the owing of the
tide, and I might very easily bring my boat about
the island again: but when I began to think of put-
ting it in practice, I had such a terror upon my
spirits at the remembrance of the danger I had
been in, that I could not think of it again with any
patience; but, on the contrary, I toolr up another
resolution, which was more safe, though more labo-
rious, and this was, that I would build, or rather
make me another periagua, or canoe, and so have
one for one side of the island, and one for the
other.
You are to understand that now I had, as I may
call it, two plantations in the island ; one, my little
fortication or tent, with the wall about it under
the rock, with the cave behind me, which, by this
time I had enlarged into several apartments or caves,
one Within another. One of these, which was the
driest and largest, and had a door out beyond my
wall or fortication, that is to say, beyond where
my wall joined to the rock, was all filled up with
large earthen pots, of which I have given an ac-
count, and with fourteen or fteen great baskets,
which would hold ve or six bushels each, where 1
laid up my stores of provision, especially my corn,
some in the ear cut o‘ short from the straw, and
the other rubbed out with my hand.
As for my wall made, as before, with long stakes
or piles, those piles grew all like trees, and were
by this time grown so big, and spread so very
much, that there was not the least appearance, to
any one’s view, of any habitation behind them.
Near this dwelling of mine, but a little far-
ther within the land, and upon lower ground, lay
my two pieces of corn-ground, which I kept duly
cultivated and sowed, and which duly yielded me
their harvest in its season; and whenever I had
occasion for more corn, 1 had more land adjoining
as t as that. '
Besides this, I had my country seat, and I had
now a tolerable plantation there also. For, rst, I
had my little bower, as I called it, which I kept in
repair ; that is to say, I kept the hedge which circled
it in, constantly tted up to its usual height, the
ladder standing always in the inside. I kept the
trees, which at rst were no more than my stakes,
but were now grown very rm and tall; I kept
them always so cut, that they might spread and
grow thick and wild, and make the more agreeable
shade, which they did effectually to my mind. In
the middle of this, I had my tent always standing,
being a piece of a sail spread over poles set up for
that purpose, and which never wanted any repair or
renewing; and under this I had made me a squab
or couch, with the skins of the creatures I had
killed, and with other soft things, and a blanket
laid on them, such as belonged to our sea~bedding,
which I had saved, and a great watch-coat to cover
me: and here, whenever I had occasion to be ab-
sent from my chief seat, I took up my country
habitation.
Adjoining to this, I had my enclosures for my
cattle, that is to say, my goats: and as I had taken
an inconceivable deal of pains to fence and enclose
this ground, I was so uneasy to see it kept entire,
lest the goats should break through, that I never
lcft off, till, with innite labour, I had stuck the
outside of the hedge so full of small stakes, and so
near to one another, that it was rather a pale than
a hedge, and there was scarce room to put a hand
through between them; which afterwards, when
those stakes grew, as they all did in the next rainy
season, made the enclosure strong, like a wall, in-
deed stronger than any wall.
This will testify for me that I was not idle, and
that I spared no pains to bring to pass whatever
appeared necessary for my comfortable support; for
I considered the keeping up a breed of tame crea-
tures thus at my hand, would be a living magazine
of flesh, milk, butter, and cheese for inc as long as
I lived in the place, if it were to be forty years;
and that keeping them within my reach, depended
entirely upon my perfecting my enclosures to such a
degree, that I might be sure of keeping them toge-
ther; which by this method indeed I so effectually
secured, that when these little stakes began to
grow, -I had planted them so very thick, I was forced
to pull some of them up again.
In this place also I had my grapes growing, which
I principally depended on for my winter-store of
raisins, and which I never failed to preserve very
carefully, as the best and most agreeable dainty of
my whole diet; and indeed they were not agreeable
only, but physical, wholesome, nourishing, and re-
freshing to the last degree.
As this was also about half way between my other
habitation and the place where I had laid up my
boat, I generally staid and lay here in my way
thither; for I used frequently to visit my boat, and
I kept all things about or belonging to her in very
good order. Sometimes I went out in her to divert
myself; but no more hazardous voyages would I
go, nor scarce ever above a stone’s cast or two
from the shore, I was so apprehensive of being hur~
ried out of my knowledge again by the currents, or
winds, or any other accident. But now I come to
a new scene of my life.
It happened one day about noon, going towards
my boat, 1 was exceedingly surprised with the print
of a man’s naked foot on the shore, which was very
plain to be seen in the sand. I stood like one thun-
derstruck, or as if I had seen an apparition. I
listened, I looked round me; I could hear nothing,
nor see any thing. I went up to a rising ground to
look farther. I went_up the shore, and down the
shore, but it was all one; I could see no other im-
pression but that one. I went to it again to see if
there were any more, and to observe if it might
not be my fancy; but there was no room for that,
for there was exactly the very print of a foot, toes,
heel, and every part of a foot: how it came thither,
I knew not, nor could in the least imagine. But
after innumerable uttering thoughts, like a man
perfectly confused and out of myself, I came home
to my fortication, not feeling, as we say, the
ground I went _on, but terried to the last degree,
looking behind me at every two or three steps, mis-
taking every bush and tree, and fancying every
stump at a distance to be a man. Nor is it possible
to describe how many various shapes an arighted
imagination represented things to me in ; how many
wild ideas were formed everymoment in my fancy,
and what strange unaccountable whimsies came into
my thoughts by the way.
When I came to my castle, for so I think I called
it ever after this, 1 ed into it like one pursued :
whether I went over by the ladder, as rst con-
trived, or went in at the hole in the rock, which I
called a door, I cannot remember; for never frighted
hare ed to cover, or fox to earth, with more terror
of mind than I to this retreat.
I had no sleep that night. The farther I was from
the occasion of my fright, the greater my apprehen-
sions were; which is something contrary to the
nature of such things, and especially to the usual
practice of all creatures in fear. But I was so em-
barrassed with my own frightful ideas of the thing,
that I formed nothing but dismal imaginations to
myself, even though I was now a great way o’ it.
Sometimes I fancied it must be the devil ; and rea-
son joined in with me upon this supposition: for
how should any other thing, in human shape, come
into the place ? Where was the vessel that brought
them? What marks were there of any other foot-
steps? And how was it possible a man should come
there? But then to think that Satan should take
human shape upon him in such a place, where there
could be no manner of occasion for it, but to leave
the print of his foot behind him, and that even for
no purpose too (for he could not be sure I should
see it), this was an amazement the other way. I
considered that the devil might have found out
abundance of other ways to have terried me, than
this of the single print of a foot: that as I lived
quite on the other side of the island, he would
never have been so simple to leave a mark in a
place where it was ten thousand to one whether I
should ever see it or not, and in the sand too,
which the rst surge of\the sea, upon a high wind,
would have defaced entirely. All this seemed‘in-
consistent with the thing itself, and with all no-
tions we usually entertain of the subtilty of the
devil. _
Abundance of such things as these assisted to
argue me out of all apprehensions of its being the
devil: and I presently concluded then, that it must
be some more dangerous creature; viz. that it must
be some of the savages of the main land over
against me, who had wandered out to sea in their
canoes, and, either driven by the currents, or by
contrary winds, had made the island; and had
been onshore, but were gone away again to sea,
being as loath, perhaps, to have staid in this de-
solate island, as I would have been to have had
them. * '
While these reections were rolling upon my
mind, I was very thankful in my thoughts, that .I
was so happy as not to be thereabouts at that time,
or that they did not see my boat, by which they
would have concluded, that some inhabitants had
been in the-place, and perhaps have searched far-
ther for me. Then terrible thoughts racked my ima-
gination about their having found my boat, and
that there were people here; and that, if so, I
should certainly have them come again in greater
numbers, and devour me; that if it should happen
so that they should not nd me, yet they would
nd my enclosure, destroy all my corn, carry away
all my ock of tame goats, and I should perish at
last for mere want.
I
Thus my fear banished all my religious hope ; all
that former condence in God, which was founded
upon such wonderful experience as I had had of
his goodness, now vanished; as if he that had fed
me by miracle hitherto, could not preserve by his
power the provision which he had made for me by
his goodness. I reproached myself with my easi-
ness, that would not sow any more corn one year
than would just serve me till the next season, as if
no accident could intervene -to prevent my enjoying
the crop that was upon the ground; and this I
thought so just a reproof, that I resolved for the
the future to have two or three years’ corn before-
hand; so that whatever might come, I might not
perish For want of bread.
I-Iow strange a checker-work of Providence is the
life of man! and by what secret different springs
are the affections hurried about, as differing cir-
cumstances present! To-day we love what to-mor-
row we hate: to-day we seek what to-morrow we
shun: to-day we desire what to-morrow we fear;
nay, even tremble at the apprehensions of. This
was exemplied in me, at this time, in the most
lively manner imaginable; for l, whose only amic-
tion was, that I seemed banished from human so-
ciety; that I was all alone, circumscribed by the
boundless ocean, cut o’ from mankind, and con-
demned to what I call silent life; that I was as one
whom Heaven thought not worthy to be numbered
among the living, or to appear among the rest of
his creatures; that to have seen one of my own
species, would have seemed to me a raising me
from death to life, and the greatest blessing that
Heaven itself, next to the supreme blessing oi’ sal~
vation, could bestow; I say, that I should now
tremble at the very apprehensions of seeing a man,
and was ready to sink into the ground at but the
shadow, or silent appearance of a man’s having set
his foot on the island.
Such is the uneven state of human life- and it
)
I
alforded me a great many curious speculations after-
wards, when I had a little recovered my rst sur-
prise. I-considered that this was the station of
life, the innitely wise and good providence of
God had determined for me; that as I could not
foresee what the ends of divine wisdom might be in
all this, so I was not to dispute his sovereignty,
who, as I was his creature, had an undoubted
right, by creation, to govern and dispose of me ab-
solutely as he thought t ; and who, as I was a crea~
ture who had offended him, had likewise a judicial
right to condemn me to what punishment he thought
t; and that it was my part to submit to bear his in-
dignation, because I -had sinned against him;
I then reected that God, who was not only
righteous, but omnipotent, as he had thought fit
thus to punish and afict me, so he was able to de-
liver me; that if he did not think t to do it, it
was my unquestioned duty to resign myself abso-
lutely and entirely to his will: and, on the other
hand, it was my duty also to hope in him, pray to
him, and quietly to attend the dictates and direc-
tions of his daily providence.
These thoughts took me up many hours, days,
nay, I may say, weeks and months ; and one par-
ticular effect of my cogitations on this occasion, I
cannot omit; viz. one morning early, lying in my
bed, and lled with thoughts about my danger from
the appearance of savages, I found it decomposed
me very much; upon which those words of the
Scripture came into my thoughts, ‘ Call upon me in
the day of trouble, and I will deliver thee, and thou
shalt glorify me.’
Upon this, rising cheerfully out of my bed, my
heart was not only comforted, but I was guided
and encouraged to pray earnestly to God for de-
liverance. When I had done praying, I took up
my Bible, and opening it to read, the rst words
that presented to me were ‘ Wait on the Lord, and
be of good cheer, and be shall strengthen thy heart;
wait, I say, on the Lord.’ It is impossible to ex-
press the comfort this gave me: and in return l
thankfully laid down the book, and was no more
sad, at least not on that occasion.
In the middle of these cogitations, apprehensions,
and reections, it came into my thoughts one day,
that all this might be a mere chimera of my own,
and that this foot might be the print of my own
foot, when I came on shore from my boat. This
cheered me up a little too, and I began to persuade
myself it was all a delusion; that it was nothing
else but my own foot; and why might not I come
that way from the boat, as well as I was going that
way to the boat? Again, I considered also, that I
could by no means tell for certain where I had
trod, and where I had not; and that if at last this
was only the print of my own foot, I had played the
part of those fools, who strive to make stories of
spectres and apparitions, and then are themselves
frighted at them more than any body else.
Now I began to take courage, and to peep abroad
again; for I had not stirred out of my castle for
three days and nights, so that I began to starve for
provision, for I had little or nothing within doors,
but some barley cakes and water. Then I knew
that my goats wanted to be milked too, which
usually was my evening diversion; and the poor
creatures were in great pain and inconvenience for
want of it, and indeed it almost spoiled some of
them, and almost dried up their milk.
Heartening myself therefore with the belief, that
this was nothing but the print of one of my own
feet (and so I might be truly said to start at my
own shadow), I began to go abroad again, and went
to my country house to milk my ock; but to see
with what fear I went forward, how often 1 looked
behind me, how I was ready, every now and then,
to lay down my basket, and run for my life, it
would have made any one have thought I was
haunted with an evil conscience, or that I had
been lately most terribly frighted ; and so indeed
I had.
However, as I went on thus two’ or three
days, and had seen nothing, I began to be a little
bolder, and to think there was really nothing in it
but my own imagination; but I could not persuade
myself fully of this, till I should go down to the
shore again, and see this print of a foot, and mea-
sure it by my own, and see if there was any simi-
litude or tness, that I might be assured it was my
own foot. But when I came to the place rst, it
appeared evidently to me, that when I laid up my
boat, I could not possibly be on shore~any where
thereabouts. Secondly, when I came to measure
the mark with my own foot, I found my foot not
so large by a great deal : both these things lled my
head with new imaginations, and gave me the va-
pours again to the highest degree, so that I shook
with cold, like one in an ague, and I went home
again, lled with the belief that some man or men
had been on shore there; or, in short, that the
island was inhabited, and I might he surprised be~
fore I was aware; and what course to take for my
security, I knew not.
0 what ridiculous resolutions men take, when
possessed with fear! It deprives them of the use
of those means which reason offers for their relief.
The rst thing I proposed to myself was, to throw
down my enclosures, and turn all my tame cattle
wild into the woods, that the enemy might not
nd them, and then frequent the island in prospect
of the same, or the like booty; then the simple
th-ing of digging up my two corn elds, that they
-might not nd such a grain there, and still be
prompted to frequent the island; then to demolish
my bower and tent, that they might not see any
vestiges of habitation, and be tempted to look far-
ther, in order to nd out the persons inhabiting.
These were the subjects of the rst night’s cogi-
tation, after I was come home again, while the ap-
prehensions which had so over-run my mind were
fresh upon me, and my head was full of vapours,
as above. Thus fear of danger is ten thousand
times more terrifying than danger itself, when ap-
parent to the eyes; and we nd the burden of
anxiety greater by much, than the evil which we
are anxious about; but, which was worse than all
this, I had not that relief in this trouble from the
resignation I used to practise, that I hoped to have.
I looked, I thought, like Saul, who complained not
only that the Philistines were upon him, but that
God had forsaken him; for I did not now take due
ways to compose my mind, by crying to God in my
distress, and resting upon his providence, as I had
done before, for my defence and deliverance; which
if I had done, I had, at least, been more cheerfully
supported under this new surprise, and perhaps car-
ried through it with more resolution.
This confusion of my thoughts kept me waking all
night; but, in the morning, I fell asleep, and hav-
ing, by the amusement of my mind, been, as it were,
tired, and my spirits exhausted, I slept very soundly,
and awaked much better composed than I had ever
been before. And now I began to think sedately;
and, upon the utmost debate with myself, I con-
cluded, that this island, which was so exceeding
pleasant, fruitful, and no farther from the main land
than as I had seen, was not so entirely abandoned
as I might imagine: that although there were no
stated inhabitants who lived on the spot, yet that
there might sometimes come boats off from the
shore, who either with design, or perhaps never but
when they were driven by cross winds, might come
to this place: that I had lived fteen years now, and
had not met with the least shadow or gure of any
people before; and that if at any time they should
be driven here, it was probable they went away
again as soon as ever they could, seeing they had
never thought t to x there, upon any occasion, to
this time: that the most I could suggest any dan-
I
ger from, was, from any such casual accidental land-
ing of straggling people from the main; who, as it
was likely, if they were driven hither, were here
against their wills, so they made no stay here, but
went off again with all possible speed, seldom stay-
ing one night on shore, lest they should not have
the help of the tides and daylight back again; and
that therefore I had nothing to do but to consider
of some safe retreat, in case I should see any savages
land upon the spot.
Now I began sorely to repent, that I had dug my
cave so large-as to bring a door through again,
which door, as I said, came out beyond where my
fortication joined to the rock. Upon maturely
considering this, therefore, I resolved to draw me a
second fortication, in thesame manner of a semi-
circle, at a distance from my wall, just where I had
planted a double row of trees, about twelve years
before, of which I made mention. These trees hav-
ing “been planted so thick before, there wanted but a
few piles to be driven between them, that they should
bethicker and stronger, and my wall would be soon
nished.
So that I had now a double wall, and my outer
wall was thickened with pieces of timber, old cables,
and every thing I could think of to make it strong;
having in it seven little holes, about as big as I
might put my arm out at. In the inside of this I
thickened my wall to about ten feet thick, con-
tinually bringing earth out of my cave, and laying it
at the foot of the wall, and walking upon it; and
through the seven holes I contrived to plant the
muskets, of which I took notice that l got seven on
shore out of the ship; these, I say, I planted like
my cannon, and tted them into frames that held
them like a carriage, that so I could re all the seven
guns in two minutes’ time. This wall I was many
a weary month in nishing, and yet never thought
myself safe till it was done.
When this was done, 1 stuck all the ground with-
out my wall, for a great way every way, as full with
stakes or sticks of the osier-like wood, which I found
so apt to grow, as they could well stand; insomuch
that I believe I might set in near twenty thousand
of them, leaving a pretty large space between them
and my wall, that I might have room to see an
enemy, and they might have no shelter from the
young trees, if they attempted to approach my outer
wall. '
Thus, in two years’ time, I had a thick grove;
and, in ve or six years’ time,‘ I had a wood before
my dwelling grown so monstrous thick and strong
that it was indeed perfectly impassable: and no
man, of what kind soever, would ever imagine that
there was any thing beyond it, much less a habita-
tion. As for the way I proposed to myself to go
in and out (for I left no avenue), it was by setting
two ladders; one to a part of the rock which was
low, and then broke in, and left room to place an~
other ladder upon that; so when the two ladders
were taken down, no man living could come down
to me without mischieng himself; and if they
had come down, they were still on the outside of
my outer wall.
’l‘h-us I took all the measures human prudence
could suggest for my own preservation ; and it will
be seen, at length, that they were not altogether
without just reason, though I foresaw nothing at
that time, more than my mere fear suggested to
me. l
While this was doing, I was not altogether care-'
less of my other affairs; for I had a great concern
upon me for my little herd of goats : they were not
only a present supply to me upon every occasion,
and began to be sutlicient to me, without the ex-
pense of powder and shot, but also abated the fa-
tigue of my hunting after the wild ones ; and I was
loath to lose the advantage of them, and to have
them all to nurse up over again.
To this purpose, after long consideration, I could
think of but two ways to preserve them: one was
to nd another convenient place to dig a cave under
ground, and to drive them into it every night ; and
the other was to enclose two or three little bits of
land, remote from one another, and as much con-
cealed as I could, where I might keep about half a
dozen young goats in each place, so that if any
disaster happened to the ock in general, I might
be able to raise them again with little trouble and
-time: and this, though it would require a great deal
of time and labour, I thought was the -most rational
design. .
Accordingly I spent some time to nd out the
most retired parts of the island; and I pitched upon
one which was as private indeed as my heart could
wish; for it was a little damp piece of ground in
the middle of the hollow and thick woods, -where, as
is observed, I almost lost myself once before, en-
deavouring to come back that way from the eastern
part of the island. Here I found a clear piece of
land, near three acres, so surrounded with woods,
that it was almost an enclosure by nature; at least
it did not want near so much labour to make it
so. as the other pieces of ground I had -worked so
hard at. _
I immediately went to work with this piece of
ground; and, in less than _a month’s time, I had so
fenced it round, that my ock or herd, call i-t which
you please, which were not so wild now as at rst
they might be supposed to be, were well enough
secured in it. So, without any farther delay, I re-
moved ten she-goats and two he~goats to this piece;
and when they were there, I continued to perfect
the fence, till I had made it as secure as the other,
which, however, I did at more leisure, and it took
me up more time by a great deal-.
. All this labour I was at the expense of, purely
from my apprehensions on the account of the print
of a man’s foot which I had seen; for as yet I
rnever saw any human creature come near the island;
and I had now lived two years under these uneasi-
nesses, which indeed made my life much less com-
fortable than it was before, as may well be imagined
by any who know what it is to live in the constant
snare of the fear of man: and this I must observe
with grief too, that the discomposure of my mind
had too great impressions also upon the religious
part of my thoughts; for the dread and terror of
falling into the hands of savages and cannibals lay
so upon my spirits, that I seldom found myself in
a due temper for application to my Maker, at least
not with the sedate calmness and resignation of
soul which I was wont to do. I rather prayed to
God as under great aliction and pressure of mind,
surrounded with danger, and in expectation every
night of being murdered and devoured before morn-
ing ; and I must testify, from my experience, that a
temper of peace, thankfulness, love, and aection,
is much the more proper frame for prayer, than that
of terror and discomposure; and that under the
dread of mischief impending, a man is no more t
for a comforting performance of the duty of praying
to God, than he is for repentance on a sick bed;
for these discomposures affect the mind as the others
do the body; and the discomposure of the mind
must necessarily be as great a disability as that of
the body, and much greater, praying to God being
properly an act of the mind, not of the body.
But to go on: after I had thus secured one part
of my little living stock, I went about the whole
island, searching for another private place, to make
such another deposit; when wandering more to the
west point of the island than I had ever done yet,
and looking out to sea, I thought I saw a boat upon
the sea, at a great distance. I had found a perspec-
tive glass or two, in one of the seamen’s chests
which I saved out of our ship, but I had it not
about me, and this was so remote that I "could not
tell what to make of it, though I looked at it till
my eyes were not able to hold to look any longer.
Whether it was a boat or not, I do not know; but
as I descended from the hill, I could see no_ more
of it, so I gave it over ; only I resolved to go no
more without a perspective glass in my pocket.
“When I was come down the hill, to the end of the
island, where indeed I had never been before, I was
presently convinced that the seeing the print of a
man’s foot was not such a strange thing in the
island as I imagined; and, but that it was a special
providence that I was cast upon the side of the
island where the savages never came, I should
easily have known that nothing was more frequent
than for the canoes from the main, when they hap-
pened to be a little too far out at sea, to shoot over
to that side of the island for harbour; likewise, as
they often met, and fought in their canoes, the
victors, having taken any prisoners, would bring
them over to this shore, where, according to their
dreadful customs, being all cannibals, they would
kill and eat them. Of which hereafter.
When I was come down the hill to the shore, as
I said above, being the S. W. point of the island, I
was perfectly confounded and amazed; nor is it
possible for me to express the horror of my mind,
at seeing the shore spread with skulls, hands, feet,
and other bones of human bodies ; and particularly
I observed a place where there had been a re made,
and a circle dug in the earth, like a cockpit, where
it is supposed the savage wretches had sat down to
their inhuman feastings upon the bodies of their fel-
low-creatures.
I was so astonished with the sight of these things,-
that I entertained no notions of any danger to my-
self from it for a long while: all my apprehensions
were buried in the thoughts of such a pitch of in-
human, hellish brutality, and the horror of the de-
generacy of human nature, which, though I had
heard of often, yet I never had so near a view of~
before; in short, I turned away my face from the
horrid spectacle : my stomach grewsick, and I was
just at the point of fainting, when nature discharged
the disorder from my stomach; and, having vo-
mited with an uncommon violence, I was a little
relieved, but could not bear to stay in the place a
moment; so I got me up the hill again, with all the
speed I could, and walked on towards my own ha-
bitation.
When I came a little out of that part of the
island, I stood still a while as amazed; and then
recovering myself, I looked up with the utmost
alfection of my soul, and, with a ood of tears in
my eyes, gave God thanks, that had cast my rst
lot in a part of the world where Iwas distinguished
from such dreadful creatures as these; and that
though I had esteemed my present condition very
miserable, had yet given me so many comforts in
it, that I had still more to give thanks for, than to
complain of; and this, above all, that I had, even
in this miserable condition, been comforted with
the knowledge of Himself, and the hope of his
blessing, which was a felicity more than sufficiently
equivalent to all the misery which I had suffered,
or could suffer.
In this frame of thankfulness, I went home to my
castle, and began to be much easier now, as to the
safety of my circumstances, than ever I was be-
fore; for I observed that these wretches never
came to this island in search of what they could
get; perhaps not seeking, not wanting, or not ex-
pecting any thing here; and having often, no doubt,
been up in the covered woody part of it, without
nding any thing to their purpose. I knew I had
been here now almost eighteen years, and never
saw the least footsteps of human creature there be-
fore ; and might be here eighteen more as entirely
concealed as I was now, if I did not discover my-
self to them, which I_ll3.(I no manner of occasion to
do; it being my only business to keep myself entirely
concealed where I was, unless I found a better sort
of creatures than cannibals to make myself known to.
Yet I entertained such an ahhorrence of the
savage wretches that I have been speaking of, and
of the wretched inhuman custom of their devour-
ing and eating one another up, that I continued
pensive and sad, and kept close within my own
circle for almost two years after this. When I say
my own circle, I mean by it my three plantations,
viz. my castle, my country seat, which I called my
bower, and my enclosure in the woods; nor did I
look after this for any other use than as an enclo-
sure for my goats: for the aversion which nature
gave me to these hellish wretches was such that I
was as fearful of seeing them, as of seeing the
devil himself. Nor did I so much as go to look
after my boat in all this time, but began rather to
think of making me another; for I could not think
of ever making any more attempts to bring the other
boat round the island to inc, lest I should meet
with some of those creatures at sea, in which, if I
had happened to have fallen into their hands, I knew
what would have been my lot.
‘lime, however, and the satisfaction I had that I
was in no danger of being discovered by these peo~
pie, began to wear off my uneasiness about them;
and I began to live just in the same composed man-
ner as before; only with this difference, that I used
more caution, and kept my eyes more about me than
I did before, lest I should happen to be seen by any
of them; and particularly I was more cautious in
ring my gun, lest any of them being on the island
should happen to hear it; and it was therefore a
very good providence to me that I had furnished
myself with a tame breed of goats, that I needed
not hunt any more about the woods, or shoot at
them; and if I did catch any of them after this, it
was by traps and snares, as I had done before: so
that for two years after this, I believe 1 never red
my gun once off; though I never went out without
it; and, which was more, as I had saved three pis-
tols out of the ship, I always carried them out with
me, or at least two of them, sticking them in my
goat-skin belt: I likewise furbished up one of the
great cutlasses that I had out of the ship, and made
me a belt to put it on also; so that I was now a
most formidable fellow to look at, when I went
abroad, if you add to the former description of my-
self the particular of two pistols, and a great broad
sword, hanging at my side in a belt, but without a
scabbard. l
Things going on thus, asl have said, for some time,
I seemed, excepting these cautions, to be reduced to
my former calm, sedate way of living. All these
things tended to showing me, more and more, how
far my condition was from being miserable, coin-
pared to some others, nay, to many other particulars
of life, which it might have pleased God to have
made my lot. It put me upon reecting how little
repining there would be among mankind, at any
condition of life, if people would rather compare
their condition with those‘ that are worse, in order
to be thankful, than be always comparing them with
those which are better, to assist their murmurings
and complainings.
As in my present condition there were not really
many things which I wanted, so indeed I thought
that the frights I had been in about these savage
wretches, and the concern I had been in for my own
preservation, had taken off the edge of my‘ inven-
tion for my own conveniences; and I had dropped
a good design, which I had once bent my thoughts
upon, and that was, to try if l could not make some
of my barley into malt, and then try to brew my-
self some beer. This was really a whimsical thought,
and I reproved myself often for the simplicity of
it; for I presently saw there would be the want of
several things necessary to the making my beer
that it would be impossible for" me to supply; as,
rst, casks to preserve it in, which was a thing that,
as I have observed already, I could never compass ;
no, though I spent not many days, but weeks, nay,
I ‘J
months, in attempting it, but to no purpose. In
the next place, I had no hops to make itkeep, no
yeast to make it work, no copper or kettle to make
it boil ; and yet, had not all these things intervened,
Imean the frights and terrors I was in about the
savages, I had- undertaken it, and perhaps brought
it to pass too ; for I seldom gave any thing over
without accomplishing it, when I once had it in my
head enough to begin it.
-But my invention now ran quite another way ; for
night and day I could think of nothing but how I
might destroy some of these monsters in their cruel
bloody entertainment, and, if possible, save the vic-
tim they shduld bring hither to destroy. It would
take up a larger volume than this whole work is in-
tended to be, to set down all the contrivances_I
hatched, or rather brooded upon, in my thoughts,
for the destroying these creatures, or at least fright-
ing them, so as to prevent their coming hither any
more; but all was abortive, nothing could be pos-
sible to take e’ect, unless I was to be there to do
it myself: and what could one man do among them,
when perhaps there might be twenty or thirty of
them together, with their darts, or their bows and
arrows, with which they could shoot as true to a
mark, as I could with my gun?
SometimesI contrived to dig a hole -under the place
where they made their re, and put in t-ve or six
pounds of gunpowder, which, when they kindled their
re, would consequently take re, and blow up all
that was near it. But as, in the rst place, I should
be very loath to waste so much powder upon them,
my store being now within the quantity of one bar-
rel, so neither could I be sure of its going off, at
any certain time, when it might surprise them, and
at best that it would do little more than just blow
the lire about their ears, and fright them, but not
sufficient to make them forsake the place; so I laid
it aside, and then proposed that I would place my-
self in ambush, in some COIIVGQICHC place, with my
three guns, all double loaded, and, in the middle
of their bloody ceremony, let y at them, when I
should be sure to kill or wound perhaps two or three
at every shot, and then falling in upon them with
my three pistols, and my sword, I made" no doubt
but that if there were twenty, I should kill them" all.
This fancy pleased my thoughts for some weeks, and
I was so full of it that I often dreamt of it, and
sometimes that I was just going to let y at them in
my sleep.
I went so far with it in my imagination, that I
employed myself several days to nd out proper
places to put myself in ambuscade,as Isaid, to watch
for them; and I went frequently to the place itself,
which was now grown more familiar to me, andies-
pecially while my mind was thus lled with thoughts
of revenge, and of a bloody putting twenty or thirty
of them to the sword, as I may call it; but the
horror I had at the place, and at the signals of the
barbarous wretches devouring one another, abated
my malice.
Well, at length I found a place in the side of the
hill, where I was satised I might securely wait
till I saw any of their boats coming, and might then,
even before they would be ready to come on shore,
convey myself unseen into thickets of the trees,
in one of which there was a hollow large enough
to conceal me entirely, and where I might sit, and
observe all their bloody doings, and take my full
aim at their heads, when they were so close to-
gether as that it would be next to impossible that
I should miss my shot, or that I could fail wounding
three or four of them at the first shot.
In this place then I resolved to x my design,
and accordingly I prepared two muskets, and my
ordinary fowling-piece. The two muskets I loaded
with a brace of slugs each, and four or ve smaller
bullets, about the size of pistol bullets; and the
fowling-piece I loaded with near a handful of swan-
shot, of the largest size. I also loaded my pistols
\
with about four bullets each: and in this posture,
wellprovided with ammunition for a second and
third charge, I prepared myself for my expedition.
After I had thus laid the scheme for my design,
and, in my imagination, put it in practice, I con-
tinually made my tour every morning up to the top
of the hill, which was from my castle, as I called it,
about three miles, or more, to sce if I could observe
any boats upon the sea, coming near the island, or
standing over towards it; but I began to tire of this
hard duty, after I had pfortwo or three months con-
stantly kept my watch, and come always back with-
out any discovery, there having not in all that time
been the least appearance, not only on or near the
shore, butnot on the whole ocean, so far as my eyes
or glasses could reach every way. . _
As long as I kept up my daily tour to the hill to
look ou-t, so long also I kept up the vigour of my
design; and my spirits seemed to be all the while in
a suitable frame, for so outrageous an execution as
the killing twenty or thirty naked savages for an
offence which I had not at all entered into a discus-
sion of in my thoughts, any further than my passions
were at rst red by the horror I conceived at the
unnatural custom of the people of that country;
who, it seems, had been suffered by Providence, in
his wise disposition of the world, to have no other
guide than that of their own abominable and vitiated
passions; and consequently were left, and perhaps
had been so for some ages, to act such horrid things,
and receive such dreadful customs, as nothing but
nature, entirely abandoned of Heaven, and actuated
by some hellish degeneracy, could have run them
into. But now, when, as I have said, l began to
be weary of the fruitless excursion which I had
made so long, and so far, every morning in vain, so
my opinion of the action itself began to alter, and
I began, with cooler and calmer thoughts, to con-
sider what it was I was going to engage in; what
authority or call I had, to pretend to be judge and
1
executioner upon these men as criminals, whom
I-Ieaven had thought t, for so many ages, to suf-
fer, unpunished, to go on, and to be, as it were,
the executioners of his judgements upon one an-
other; also how far these people were offenders
against me, and what right I had to engage in the
quarrel of that blood, which they shed promiscu-
ously one upon another. I debated this very often
with myself thus: How do I know what God him-
self judges in this particular case? 1t is certain
these people do not commit this as a crime: it is
not against their own consciences reproving, or
their light reproaching them. They do not know it
to be an offence, and then commit it in deance of
divine justice, as we do in almost all the sins we
commit. They think it no more a crime to kill a.'
captive taken in war, than we do to kill an ox; nor
to eat human esh, than we do to eat mutton.
When I had considered this a little, it followed
necessarily that I was certainly in the wrong in it ;
that these people were not murderers in the sense
that L had before condemned them in my thoughts,
any more than those Christians were murderers
who often put to death the prisoners taken in bat-
tle, or more frequently, upon many occasions, put
whole troops of men to the sword, without giving
quarter, though they threw down their arms, and
submitted.
In the next place it occurred to me, that albeit the
usage they gave one another was thus brutish and
inhuman, yet it was really nothing to me; that these
people had done me no injury; that if they at-
tempted me, or I saw it necessary for my immediate
preservation to fall upon them, something might be
said for it; but that l was yet out of their power,
and they had really no knowledge of me, and conse~
quently no design upon me; and therefore it could
not be just for me to fall upon them: that this
would justify the conduct of the Spaniards, in all
their barbarities practised in America, where they
destroyed millions of these people, who, however
they were idolaters and barbarians, and had several
bloody and barbarous rites in their customs, such as
sacricing human bodies to their idols, were yet, as
to the Spaniards, very innocent people; and that
the rooting them out of the country is spoken of
with the utmost abhorrence and detestation, even
by the Spaniards themselves, at this time, and by all-
other Christian nations of Europe, as a mere butch-
ery, and a- bloody and.unnatural piece of cruelty,
unjustiable either to God or man; and such, as
for which the very name of a Spaniard is reckoned
to be frightful and terrible to all people of humanity,
or of Christian compassion; as if the kingdom of
Spain were particularly eminent for the product of
a race of men who were without principles of ten-
derness, or the common bowels of pity to the miser-
able, which is reckoned to be a mark of generous
temper in the mind.
These considerations really put me to a pause, and
to a kind of a full stop ; and I began, by little and
little, to be off my design, and to conclude I had
taken wrong measures in my resolutions to attack
the savages; that it was not my businessto meddle
with them, unless they rst attacked me, and this it
was my business, if possible, to prevent; but that
if I were discovered, and attacked, then I knew my
duty. A h ~
On the other hand, I argued with myself that this
really was the way not to deliver myself, but en-
tirely to ruin and destroy myself; for unless I was
sure to kill every one that not only should be on
shore at that time, but that should ever come on
shore afterwards, if but one of them escaped to tell
their country people what had happened, they would
_come over again, by-thousands, to revenge the death
of their fellows; and 'I should only bring upon my-
self a certain destruction, which at present I had no
manner of occasion for.
Upon the whole I concluded that neither in prin-
\
ciples nor in policy I ought, one way or other, to
concern myself in this affair; that my business
was, by all possible means, to conceal myself from
them, and not to leave the least signal to them to
guess by that there were any living creatures upon
the island; I mean of human shape.
Religion joined in with this prudential resolu-
tion; and I was convinced now many ways, that I
was perfectly out of my duty, when I was laying
all my bloody schemes for the destruction of inno-
cent creatures; 1 mean innocent as to me. As to
the crimes they were guilty of towards one another,
I had nothing to do with them: they were national,
and I ought to leave them to the justice of God,
who is the governor of nations, and knows how to
bring public judgements upon those who oend in
a public manner, by such -ways as best please him.
This appeared so clear to me now, that nothing
was a greater satisfaction to me than that I had not
been suffered to do a thing which I now saw so
much reason to believe would have been no less a
sin, than that of wilful murder, if I had committed
it; and I gave most humble thanks on my knees to
God, that had thus delivered me from blood-guilti-
ness, beseeching him to grant me the protection of
his providence, that I might not fall into the hands
of barbarians, or that I might not lay my hands
upon them, unless I had a more clear call from Hea-
ven to do it, in defence of my own life.
In this disposition I continued for near a year
after this; and so far was I from desiring an oc-
casion for falling upon these wretches, that in all
that time I never once went up the hill to see
whether there were any of them in sight, or to
know whether any of them had been on shore
there or not, that I might not be tempted to renew
any of my contrivances against them, or be pro-
voked by any advantage which might present itself
to fall upon them; only this '1 did, I went and re-
moved my boat, which I had on the other side of
the island, and carried it down to the east end of
the whole island, where I ran it into a little cove,
which I found under some high rocks, and where I
knew, by reason of the currents; the savages durst
not, at least would not, come with their boats, upon
any account whatsoever.
With my boat, I carried away every thing that I
had left there belonging to her, though not neces-
sary for the bare going thither, viz. a mast and sail,
which I had made for her, and a thing like an an-
chor; but indeed which could not be called either
anchor or grappling: however, it was the best I
could make of its kind. All these I removed, that
there might not be the least shadow of any disco-
very, or any appearance of any boat, or of any hu-
man habitation upon the island. '
Besides this, I kept myself, as I said, more re-
tired than ever, and seldom went from my cell,
other than upon my constant employment, viz. to
milk my she-goats, and manage my little ock in
the wood, which, as it was on the other part of the
island, was quite out of danger: for certain it is,
that these savage people, who sometimes haunted
this island, never came with any thoughts of nding
any thing here, and consequently never wandered
off from the coast; and I doubt not, but they might
have been several times on shore, after my appre-
hensions of them had made me cautious, as well as
before; and indeed I looked back with some hor-
ror upon the thoughts of what my condition would
have been, if I had chopped upon them, and been
discovered before that, when naked and unarmed,
except with one gun, and that loaded often only
with small shot. I walked every where peeping and
peering about the island, to see what I could got:
what a surprise should I have been in, if, when I
discovered the print of a man’s foot, I had, instead
of that, seen fteen or twenty savages, and found
them pursuing me, and, by the swiftness of their
running, no possibility of my escaping them !
The thoughts of this sometimes sunk my very
soul within me, and distressed my mind so much
that I could not soon recover it; to think what I
should have done, and how I not only should not
have been able to resist them, but even should not
have had presence of mind enough to do what 1
might have done, much less what now, after so
much consideration and preparation, I might be able
to do. Indeed, after serious thinking of these
things, I would be very melancholy, and sometimes
it would last a great while; but I resolved it at
last all into tbankfulness to that Providence which
had delivered me from so many unseen dangers,
and had kept me from those mischiefs, which I
could no way have been the agent in delivering my-
self from; because I had not the least notion of
any such thing depending, or the least supposition
of its being possible.
This renewed a contemplation which often had
come to my thoughts in former time, when rst I
began to see the merciful dispositions of Heaven, in
the dangers we run through in this life: how won-
derfully we are delivered, when we know nothing of
it : how when we are in (a quandary, as we call it)
a doubt or hesitation, whether to go this way, or
that way, a secret hint should direct us this way,
when we intended to go that way; nay, when sense,
our own inclination, and perhaps business, has called
to go the other way, yet a strange impression upon
the mind, from we know not what springs, and by
we know not what power, shall over-rule us to go
this way; and it shall afterwards-appear that had
we gone that way which we should have gone, and
even to our imagination ought to have gone, we
should have been ruined and lost. Upon these,
and many like reections, I afterwards made it a
certain rule with me, that whenever 1 found those
secret hints, or pressings of my mind, to doing or
not doing any thing that presented, or to going this
way or that way, I never failed to obey the secret
dictate, though I knew no other reason for it, than
that such a pressure, or such a hint, hung upon my
mind. I could give many examples of the success
of this conduct, in the course of my life; but more
especially in the latter part of my inhabiting this
unhappy island: besides many occasions which it
is very likely I might have taken notice of, if I had
seen with the same eyes then, that I saw with now.
But it is never too late to be wise; and I cannot but
advise all considering men, whose lives are attended
with such extraordinary incidents as mine, or even
though not so extraordinary, not to slight such se-I
cret intimations of Providence, let them come from
what invisible intelligence they will, that I shall
not discuss, and perhaps cannot account for; but
certainlythey are a proof of the converse of spirits,
and the secret communication between those imbe-
died and those unimbodied, and such a proof as
can never be withstood: of which I shall have oc-
casion to give some very remarkable instances in
the remainder of my solitary residence in this dis-
mal place.
I believe the reader of this will not think it
strange if I confess that these anxieties, these con-
stant dangers I lived in, and the concern that
was now upon me, put an end to all invention,
and to all the contrivances that I had laid for
my future accommodations and conveniences. I
had the care of my safety more now upon my hands,
than that of my food. I cared not to drive a nail,
or chop a stick of wood now, for fear the noise I
should make should be heard, much less would I
re a gun for the same reason; and, above all, I
was very uneasy at making any re, lest the smoke,
which is visible at a great distance in the day,
should betray me; and for this reason I removed
that part of my business, which required re, such
as burning of pots and pipes, &c. into my new
apartment in the woods, where, after I had been
some time, I found, to my unspeakable consolation,
a mere natural cave in the earth, which went in a
vast way, and where, I dare say, no savage, had
he been at the mouth of it, would be so hardy as
to venture in; nor indeed would any man else, but
one who, like me, wanted nothing so much as a safe
retreat.
The mouth of this hollow was at the bottom of
a great rock, where, by mere accident (I ‘would
say, if I did not see abundant reason to ascribe all
such things now to Providence), I was cutting down
some thick branches of trees, to make charcoal ;
and before I go on, I must observe the reason of my
making this charcoal, which was thus:
I was afraid of making a smoke about my habita-
tion, as I said before ; a.nd yet I could not live there
without baking my bread, cooking my meat, &c.; so I
contrived to burn some wood here, as I had seen
done in England under turf, till it became chark, or
dry coal ; and then putting the re out, I preserved
the coal to carry home, and perform the other ser-
vices which re was wanting for at home, without
danger of smoke.
But this by the bye. While I was cutting down
some wood here, I perceived that, behind a very
thick branch of low brushwood, or underwood, there
was a kind of hollow place. I was curious to look
into it, and getting with diiculty into the mouth of
it, I found it was pretty large, that is to say, suf-
cient for me to stand upright in it, and perhaps
another with me; but I must confess to you, I made
more haste out than I did in, when looking furtherinto
the place, which was perfectly dark, I saw two broad
shining eyes of some creature, whether devil or
man I knew not, which twinkled like two stars;
the dim light from the cave’s mouth shining directly
in; and making the reection.
However, after some pause, I recovered myself,
and began to call myself a thousand fools, and tell
myself, that he that was afraid to see the devil, was
not t to live twenty years in an island all alone,
ms Robinson on USOE.
and that I durst to believe there was nothing in this
cave that was more frightful than myself. Upon
this, plucking up my courage, I took up a great re-
brand, and in I rushed again, with the stick aming
in my hand. I had not gone three steps in, but I
was almost as much frighted as I was before ; for I
heard a very loud sigh, like that of a man in some
pain, and it was followed by a broken noise, as if of
words half expressed, and then a deep sigh again. I
stepped back, and was indeed struck with such a
surprise, that it put me into a cold sweat; and if I
had had a hat on my head, I will not answer for it,
that my hair might not have lifted it off. But still
plucking up my spirits as well as I could, and en-
couraging myself a little, with considering that the
power and presence of God was every where, and
was able to protect me, I stepped forward again,
and, by the light of the rebrand, holding it up a
little over my head, I saw, lying on the ground, a
most monstrous frightful old he-goat, just making
his will, as we say, gasping for life, and dying indeed
of more old age.
I stirred him a little, to see if I could get him
out, and he essayed to get up, but was not able to
raise himself: and I thought with myself lie might
even lic there; for if he had frighted mo so, he would
certainly fright any of the savages, if any of them
should be so hardy as to come in there, while he had
any life in him.
I was now recovered from my surprise, and began
to look round me, when I found the cave was but
very small ; that is to say, it might be about twelve
feet over, but in no manner of shape, cithcr round or
square, no hands having over been employed in
making it, but those of mere nature. 1 observed
also, that there was a place at the farther side of it,
that went in farther, but was so low that it required
me to creep upon my hands and knees to go into it,
and whither it went, I knew not; so having no
candle, I gave it over for some time, but resolved
to come again the next day, provided with candles
and a tinder-box, which I had made of the lock of
one of the muskcts, with some wildre in the pan.
Accordingly, the next day,I came provided with six
large candles of my own making, for I made very
good candles now of goat’s tallow ; and, going into
this low place, I was obliged to creep upon all fours,
as I have said, almost ten yards, which, by the way,
I thought was a venture bold enough, considering
that I knew not how far it might go. or what was
beyond it. When I was got through the strait, I
found the roof rose higher up, I believe near twenty
feet; but never was such a glorious sight seen in the
island, I dare say, as it was, to look round the sides
and roof of this vault or cave. The walls reected
a hundred thousand lights to me from my two can-
dles : whatit was in the rock, whether diamonds, or
any other precious stones, or gold, which I rather
supposed it to be, I knew not.
The place I was in, was a most delightful cavity,
or grotto, of its kind, as could be expected, though
perfectly dark : the floor was dry and level, and had
a sort of small loose gravel upon it, so that there
was no nauseous or venomous creature to be seen;
neither was there any damp or wct on the sides or
roof. The only diiculty in it was the entrance,
which, however, as it was a place of security, and
such a retreat as I wanted, I thought that was a
"convenience; so that I was really rejoiced at the
discovery, and resolved, without any delay, to bring
some of those things which I was most anxious
about to this place; particularly 1 resolved to bring
hither my magazine of powder, and all my spare
arms, viz. two fowling-pieces (for I had three in
all), and three muskets (for of them I had eight in
all); so I kept at my castle only ve, which stood
ready mounted, like pieces of cannon, on my out-
most fence, and were ready also to take out upon
any expedition.
Upon this occasion of removing my ammunition,
I was obliged to open the barrel of powder which
I tookup out of the sea, and which had been wet;
and I found that the water had penetrated about
three or four inches into the powder on every side,
which, caking and growing hard, had preserved the
inside like a kernel in a shell, so that 1 had near
sixty pounds of very good powder in the centre of
the cask; and this was an agreeable discovery to
me at that time: so I carried all away thither, never
keeping above two or three pounds of powder with
me in my castle, for fear of a surprise of any kind.
I also carried thither all the lead I had left for
bullets.
I fancied myself now like one of the ancient
giants, which were said to live in caves and holes
in the rocks, where none could come at them; for
I persuaded myself, while I was here, if ve hun-
dred savages were to hunt me, they could nevernd
me out ; or if they did, they would not venture to
attack me here.
The old goat, whom I found expiring, died in the
mouth of the cave, the next day after I made this
discovery ; and I found it much easier to dig a great
hole there, and throw him in, and cover him with
earth, than to drag him out: so I interred him there,
to prevent offence to my nose.
I was now in my twenty-third year of residence
in this island, and was so naturalized to the place,
and to the manner of living, that could I have but
enjoyed the certainty, that no savages would come
to the place to disturb me, I could have been con-
tent to have capitulated for spending the rest of my
time there, even to the last moment, till I had laid
me down and died, like the old go-at in the cave. I
had also arrived to some little diversions and amuse-
ments, which made the time pass more pleasantly
with me a great deal than it did before; as, rst, I
had taught my Poll, as I noted before, to speak, and
he did it so familiarly, and talked so articulately and
plain, that it was very pleasant to me; and he lived
with me no 'less than six-and-twenty years. How
long he might live afterwards I know not; though I
know they have a notion, in the Brasils, that they
live a hundred years. Perhaps poor Poll may be
alive there still, calling after ‘ poor Robin Crusoe ’
to this day. I wish no Englishman the ill luck to
come there and hear him; but if he did, he would
certainly believe it was the devil. My dog was a
very pleasant and loving companion to me for no
less than sixteen years of my time, and then died
of mere old age. As for my cats, they multiplied,
as I have observed, to that degree, that I was
obliged to shoot several of them at rst, to keep
them from devouring me, and all I had; but at
length, when the two old ones I brought with me
were gone, and after some time continually driving
them from me, and letting them have no provision
with me, they all ran wild into the woods, except
two or three favourites, which I kept tame, and
whose young, when they had any, I always drown-
ed; and these were part of my family. Besides
these, I always kept two or three household kids
about me, which I taught to feed out of my hand;
and lhad some more parrots, which talked pretty
well, and would all call‘ Robin Crusoe,’ but none
like my rst ; nor, indeed, did I take the pains with
any of them that 1 had done with him. I had also
several tame sea fowls, whose names I know not,
which I caught upon the shore, and cut their wings;
and the little stakes, which I had planted before my
castle wall, being now grown up to a good thick
grove, these fowls all lived among these low trees,
and bred there, which was very agreeable to me; so
that, as I said above, I began to be very well con-
tented with the life I led, if it might but have been
secured from the dread of the savages.
- But it was otherwise directed ; and it may not be
amiss for all people who shall meet with my story,
to make this just observation from it; viz. how fre~
quently, in the course of our lives, the evil, which
in itself we seek most to shun, and which, when we
are fallen into, is the most dreadful to us, is often-
times the very means or door of our deliverance, by
which alone we can be raised again from the alilic~
tion we are fallen into. I could give many examples
of this in the course of my unaccountable life; but
in nothing was it more particularly remarkable, than
in the circumstances of the last years of my solitary
residence in this island.
It was now the month of December, as I said
above, in my twenty-third year; and this being the
southern solstice, for winter I cannot call it, was the
particular time of my harvest, and required my
being pretty much abroad in the elds; when going
out pretty early in the morning, even before it was
thorough daylight, I‘ was surprised with seeing a
light of some re upon the shore, at a distance from
me of about two miles, towards the end of the
island where I had observed some savages had
been, as before; but not on the other side, but, to
my great affliction, it was on my side of the island.
I was indeed terribly surprised at the sight, and
‘stopped short within my grove, not daring to go out,
lest 1 might be surprised; and yeti had no more peace
within, from the apprehensions I had that if these
savages in rambling over the island, should nd my
corn standing, or cut, or any of my works and im-
provements,‘ they would immediately conclude, that
there were people in the place, and would then never
give over till they found me out. In this extremity
I went back directly to my castle, pulled up the lad-
der after me, having made all things without look as
wild and natural as I could. .
Then I prepared myself within, putting myself in
a posture of defence. I loaded all my cannon, as I
called them, that is to say, my musquets, which
were mounted upon my new fortication, and all
my pistols, and resolved to defend myself to the
last gasp ; not forgetting seriously to commend my-
self to the Divine Protection, and earnestly to pray
to God to deliver me out of the hands of the bar-
barians : and in this posture I continued about two
hours, but began to be mighty impatient for intelli-
gence abroad, for I had no spies to send out.
After sitting awhile longer, and musing what I
should do in this case, I was not able to bear sitting
in ignorance longer; so setting up my ladder to the
side of the hill, where there was a at place, as I
observed before, and then pulling the ladder up
after me, I set it up again, and mounted to the top
of the hill; and pulling out my perspective glass,
which I had taken on purpose, I laid me down at
on my belly on the ground, and beganto look for
the place. I presently found there were no less
than nine naked savages sitting round a small re
they had made ; not to warm them, for they had no
need of that, the weather being extreme hot, but,
as I supposed, to dress some of their barbarous diet
of human esh, which they had brought with them,
whether alive or dead, I could not know.
They had two canoes with them, which they had
hauled up upon the shore; and as it was then tide
of ebb, they seemed to mo to wait the return of the
ood to go away again. It is not easy to imagine
what confusion this sight put me into, especially
seeing them come on my side the island, and so
near me too; but when I observed their coming
must be always with the current of the ebb, I began
afterwards to be more sedate in my mind, being
satised that I might go abroad with safety, all the
time of tide of ood, if they were not on shore be-
fore; and having made this observation, 1 went
abroad about my liarvest-work with the more com~
posure.
As I expected, so it proved; for as soon as the
tide made to the westward, I saw them all take
boat, and row (or paddle, as we call it) all away. I
should have observed, that for an hour and more
before they went "off, they went to dancing, and I
could easily discern their postures and gestures by
K
my glasses: I could not perceive, by my nicegt ob.
servation, but that they were stark naked, and had
not the least covering upon them ; but whether they
were men or women, that I could not distinguish.
As soon as I saw them shipped and gone, I took
two guns upon my shoulders, and two pistols at
my girdle, and my great sword by my side, without
a scabbard, and with all the speed I was able to
make, I went away to the hill, where I had dis-
covered the rst appearance of all. As soon as I
got thither, which was not less than two hours (for
I could not go apace,_ being so loaden with arms as
I was), I perceived there had been three canoes
more of savages onhthat place; and looking out fur-
ther, I saw they were all at sea together, making
over for the main.
This was a dreadful sight to me; especially when
going down to the shore, l could see the marks of
horror which the dismal work they had been about
had left behind it, viz. the blood, the bones, and part
of the esh of human bodies, eaten and devoured
by those wretches with mcrriment and sport. I
was so lled with indignation at the sight, that I
began now to premeditate the destruction of the
next that I saw there, let them be who or how many
soever.
‘It seemed evident to me, that the visits which
they thus made to this island, were not very fre-
quent; for it was above fteen months before any
more of them came on shore there again; that is
to say, I never saw them, or any footsteps or signals
of them, in all that time: for, as to the rainy sea-
sons, then they are sure not to come abroad, at
least not so far; yet all this while I lived uncom-
fortably, by reason of the constant apprehensions I
was in of their coming upon me by surprise: from
whence I observe, that the. expectation of evil is
more bitter than the suffering, especially if there is
no room to shake off that expectation, or those ap-
prehensions. ~ ' . _ I . '
During all this time, I was in the murdering hu-
mour; and took up most of my hours, which should
have been better employed, in contriving how to
circumvent and fall upon them the very next time
I should seeithem, especially if they should be
divided. as they were the last time, into two par-
ties: nor did I consider at all, that if I killed one
party,.suppose terf or a dozen, I was still the next
day, or week, or month, to kill another, and so
another, even ad 11-nnitum, till I should be at
length no less a murderer than they were in being
man-eaters, and perhaps much more so. '
I spent my days now in great perplexity and
anxiety of mind, expecting that I should one day or
other fall into the hands of these merciless crea-_
tnres. If I did at any time venture abroad, it was
not without looking round me with the greatest
care and caution imaginable; and now I found, to-
my great comfort, how happy it was that I had pro-
vided a tame ock or herd of goats; for I durst not,
upon any account, re my gun, especially near that
side of the island, where they usually came, lest I
should alarm the savages; and if they had edfrom
me now, I was sure to have them come back again,
with perhaps two or three hundred canoes with
them, in a few days, and then I knew what to
expect.
However, I wore out a year and three months
more, before I ever saw any more of the savages; and
then I found them again, as I shall soon observe. It
is true. they might have been there once or twice;
but either they made no stay, or at least I did not
hear them: but in the month of May, as near as I
could calculate, and in my four-and-twentieth year,
I had a very strange encounter with them, of which
in its place.
The perturbation of my mind, during this fteen
or sixteen months’ interval, was very great. I ‘slept
unquiet, dreamed always frightful dreams, and often
started out of my. sleep in the night: in the day
196 nonmson CRUSOE.
great troubles overwhelmed my mind ; in the night
I dreamed often of killing savages, and the reasons
why I might justifythe doing of it. But, to wave
all this for a while, it was in the middle of May, on
the sixteenth day, I think, as well as my poor
wooden calendar would reckon; for I marked all
upon the post still: I say. it was on the sixteenth
of May, that it blew a very great storm of wind
all day, with a great deal of lightning and thunder,
and a very foul night was after it. I know not
what was the particular occasion of it; but as I was
reading in the Bible, and taken up with serious
thoughts about my present condition, I was sur-
prised with the noise of a gun, as I thought, red
at sea.
This was, to be sure, a surprise of a quite differ-
ent nature from any I had met with before; for the
notions this put into my thoughts were quite of
another kind. I started up in the greatest haste
imaginable; and, in a trice, clapped up my ladder
to the middle place of the rock, and pulled it after
me, and, mounting it the second time, got to the
top of the hill: that very moment a ash of re
bade me listen for a second gun, which accordingly,
in about half a minute, 1 heard ; and by the sound
knew that it was from that part of the sea where I
was driven out with the currentin my boat.
I immediately considered, that this must -be some
ship in distress, and that they had some comrade, or
some other ship in company, and red these guns
for signals of distress, and to obtain help. I had
this presence of mind at that minute, as to think
that though I could not help them, it may be they
might help me; so I brought together all the dry
wood I could get at hand, and making a good hand-
some pile, I set it on re upon the hill. The wood
was dry, and blazed freely; and though the wind
blew very hard, yet it burnt fairly out, so that I
was certain, if there was any such thing as a ship,
they must needs see it, and no doubt they did;
for as soon as ever my re blazed up, I heard an-
other gun, and after that several others, all from
the same quarter. I plied my re all night long,
till day broke; and when it was broad day, and the
air cleared up, I saw something at a great distance
at sea, full east of the island, whether a sail, or a
hull, I could not distinguish, no not with my glass-
es, the distance was so great, and the weather still
something hazy also; at least it was so out at sea.
I looked frequently at it all that day, and soon
perceived that it did not move; so I presently con-
cluded that it was a ship at anchor; and being
eager, you may be sure, to be satised, I took my
gun in my hand, and ran towards the south-east
side of the island, to the rocks, where I had been
formerly carried away with the current; and get-
ting up there, the weather by this time being per-
fectly clear, I could plainly see, to my great sor-
row, the wreck of a ship cast away in the night
upon those concealed rocks, which I found when
I was out in my boat; and which rocks, as they
checked the violence of the stream, and made a
kind of counter-stream, or eddy, were the occa-
sion of my recovering then from the most desper-
ate, hopeless condition that ever I had been in, all
my life.
Thus, what is one man’s safety, is another man’s
destruction; for it seems these men, whoever they
were, being out of their knowledge, and the rocks
being wholly under water, had been driven upon
them in the night, the wind blowing hard at E. and
E.N. E. I-Iad they seen the island, as I must ne-
cessarily suppose they did not, they must, as I
thought, have endeavoured to have saved them-
selves on shore by the help of their boat; but their
ring of their guns for help, especially when they
saw, as I imagined, my re, lled me with many
thoughts. Ifirst, I imagined that, upon seeing my
light, they might have put themselves into their
boat, and have endeavoured to make the shore;
198 nomnson enuson. '
but that the sea going very high, they might have
been cast away. Other times I imagined that they
might have lost their boat before, as might be the
case many ways; as particularly by the breaking
of the sea upon their ship, which many times
obliges men to stave, or take in pieces their boat;
and sometimes to throw it overboard with their
own hands. Other times I imagined they had some
other ship or ships in company, who, upon the sig-
nals of distress they had made, had taken them
up, and carried them oil’. Other whiles I fancied
they were all gone off to sea in their boat, and,
being hurried away by the current that I had been
formerly in, were carried out into the great ocean,
where there was nothing but misery and-perish-
ing; and that perhaps they might, by this time,
think of starving, and of being in a condition to eat
one another.
As all these were but conjectures at best, so, in
the condition I was in, I could do no more than
look upon the misery of the poor men, and pity
them, which had still this good eifect on my side,
that it gave me more and more cause to give thanks
to God, who had so happily and comfortably pro-
vided for me in my desolate condition; and that of
two ships’ companies, who were now cast away
upon this part of the world, not one life should be
spared but mine. I learnt here again to observe,
that it is very rare that the providence of God casts
us into any condition of life so low, or any misery
so great, but we may see something or other to be
thankful for, and may see others in worse circum-
stances than our own.
Such certainly was the case of these men, of whom
I could not so much as see room to suppose any of
them were saved: nothing could make it rational,
so much as to wish or expect that they did not all
perishthere, except the possibility only of their
being taken up by another ship in company: and
this was but mere possibility indeed; for I saw
not the least signal or appearance of any such
thing. _
I cannot explain, by any possible energy of words,
what a strange longing orhankering of desires I felt
in my soul upon this sight, breaking out sometimes
thus: ‘ O that there had been but one or two, nay,
or but one soul saved out of the ship, to have
escaped to me, that I might but have had one com-
panion, one fellow-creature, to have spoken to me,
and to have conversed with!’ In all the time of
my solitary life, l never felt so earnest, so strong a
desire after the society of my fellow-creatures, or so
deep a regret at the want of it.
There are some secret moving springs in the affec-
tions, which, when they are set agoing by some
object in view, or bc it some object, though not in
view, yet rendered present to the mind by the
power of imagination, whose motion carries out the
soul by its impetuosity to such violent, eager em-
bracings of the object, that the absence of it is in-
supportable. '
Such were these earnest wishings; that but one
man had been saved. O that it had been but one!
I believe I repeated the words, ‘ .0 that it had been
but one!’ a thousand times; and my desires were
so moved by it, that when I spoke the words, my
hands would clinch together, and my lingers press
the palms of my hands, that if I had had any soft
thing in my hand, it would have crushed it in.
voluntarily; and my teeth in my head would strike
together, and set against one another so strong, that
for some time I could not part them again.
Let the naturalists explain these things, and the
reason and manner of them: all I can say, is, to
describe the fact, -which \\ as even surprising to me
when I found it, though 1 knew not from what it
should proceed; it was doubtless the ellect of ar-
dent wishcs, and of strong ideas formed in my mind,
realizing the comfort which the conversation of one
of my fellow Christians would have been to me.
But it was not to be; either their fate, or mine,
or both, forbade it: for, till the last year of my
being on this island, I never knew whether any
were saved out of that ship or no; and had only
the aliction, some days after, to see the corpse of a
drowned boy come on shore, at the end of the
island, which was next the shipwreck. IIe had on
no clothes but a seaman’s waistcoat, a pair of
open-l<nee'd linen drawers, and a blue linen shirt;
but nothing to direct me so much as to guess what
nation he was of. He had nothing in his pocket but
two pieces ol’ eight, and a tobacco-pipe; the last was
to me often times more valuo than the rst.
It was now calm, and I had a great mind to ven-
ture out in my boat to this wreck, not doubting but
I might nd something on board that might be use.-
ful to me; but that did not altogether press me so
much, as the possibility that there might be yet some
living creature on board, whose life 1 might not only
save, but might, by saving that life, comfort my
own to the last degree: and this thought clung so
to my heart, that I could not be quiet, night nor
day, but I must venture out in my boat on board
this wreck; and committing the rest to (3od's pro-
vidence, I thought the impression was so strong
upon my mind, that it could not be resisted, that
it must come from some invisible direction, and that
I should he wanting to myself, if 1 did not go.
Under the power of this impression, I hastened
back to my castle, prepared every thing for my
voyage, took a quantity of bread, a great pot for
fresh water, a compass to steer by, a bottle of rum
(For l had still a great deal of that left), a basket
full of raisins: and thus loading myself with every
thing necessary, I went down to my boat, got the
‘water out of her, and got her afloat, loaded all my
cargo in her, and then went home again for more.
My second cargo was a great bag full of rice, the
umbrella to set up over my head for shade, another
large pot full of fresh water, and about two dozen
of my small loaves, or barley-cakes, more than be-
fore, with a bottle of goat’s milk, and a cheese ; all
which, with great labour and sweat, I brought to
my boat, and praying to God to direct my voyage,
I put out, and rowing or paddling the canoe along
the shore, I came at last to the utmost point of the
island, on that side, viz. N. E. And now I was to
launch out into the ocean; and either to venture,
or not to venture. I looked on the rapid currents
which ran constantly on both sides of the island, at
a distance, and which were very terrible to me,
from the remembrance of the hazard I had been in
before, and my heart began to fail mo; for I fore-
saw, that if I was driven into either of those cur-
rents, I should be carried a vast way out to sea,
and perliaps out of my, reach, or sight of the island
again ; and that then, as my boat was but small, if
any little gale of wind should rise, I should be in-
evitably lost.
. These thoughts so oppressed my mind, that I
began to give over my enterprise, and having hauled
my boat into a little creek on the shore, 1 stepped
out, and sat mo down upon a little spot of rising
ground, very pensive and anxious, between fear and
desire about my voyage; when, as I was musing, I
could perceive that the tide was turned, and the
ood came on, upon which my going was for so
many hours iinpracticable. Upon this it presently
occurred to me, that I should go up to the -highest
piece of ground I could nd, and observe, if I could,
how the sets of the tide or currents lay, when the
ood came in, that I niightjudge whether, ifl was
driven one way out, I might not expect to be driven
another way home, with the same rapidness of the
currents. This thought was no sooner in my head,
but I cast my, eye upon a little hill, which sulfi-
ciently overlooked the sea both ways, and from
whence I had a clear view of the currents, or sets
of the tide, and which way I was to guide myself
in my return. Here I found that as the current of
K Q
the ebb set out close by the south point of the
island, so the current of the ood set in close by
the shore of the north side; and that I had nothing
to do but to keep to the north of the island in my
return, and I should do well enough.
Encouraged with this observation, I resolved the
next morning to set out with the rst of the tide;
and reposing myse.lf for that night in the canoe,
under the great watch-coat I mentioned, I launched
out. I made rst a little out to sea, full north, till
I began to feel the benet of the current, which set
eastward, and which carried me at a great rate, and
yet did not so hurry me as the southern side cur-
rent had done before, and so as to take--e from me
all government of the boat; but, having a strong
steerage with my paddle, I went, I say, at a great
rate, directly for the wreck, and in less than two
hours I came up to it.
It was a dismal sight to look at: the ship, which
by its building was Spanish, stuck fast, jambed in
between two rocks; all the stern and quarter of her
was beaten to pieces with the sea; and as her fore-
castle, which stuck in the rocks, had run on with
great violence, her main-mast and fore-mast were
brought by the board, that is to say. broken short
off; but her bowsprit was sound, and the head and
bow appeared rm. When 1 came close to her, a
dog appeared upon her, who, seeing me coming,
yelped and cried; and as soon as I called him,
jumped‘ into the sea, to come to me; and I took
him into the boat, but found him almost dead for
hunger and thirst. I gave him a cake of my bread,
and he eat like a ravenous wolf, that had been
starving a fortnight in the snow. I then gave the
poor creature some fresh water, with which, if I
would have let him, he would have burst him-
self.
After this I went on board. The rst sight I met
with was two men drowned in the cook-room, or
forecastle of the ship, with their arms fast about
one another. I concluded, as is indeed probable,
that when the ship struck, it being in a storm, the
sea broke so high, and so continually over her, that
the men were not able to bear it, and were strangled
with the constant rushing in of the water, as much
as if they had been under water. Besides the dog,
there was nothing left in the ship that had life, nor
any goods that I could see, but what were spoiled
by the water. There were some easks of liquor,
whether wine or brandy, 1 knew not, which lay
lower in the hold, and which, the water being ebbed
out, I could see; but they were too big to meddle
with. 1 saw several chests, which I believed be-
longed to some of the seamen, and I got two of
them into the boat, without examining what was in
them.
Had the stern of the shi been xed, and the fore
part broken off, 1 am pergaded I might have made
a good voyage; for, by what 1 found in these two
chests, I had room to suppose the ship had a great
deal of wealth on board: and, if I may guess by the
course she steered, she musghave been bound from
Buenos Ayres, or the Rio de la Plata, in the south
part of America, beyond the Brasils, to the Havanna,
in the gulf of Mexico, and so perhaps to Spain. She
had, no doubt, a great treasure in her, but of no
use at that time to any body; and what became of
the rest of her people, I then knew not.
I found, besides these chests, a little cask full of
liquor, of about twenty gallons, which l got into my
boat with much diiculty. ’l‘here were several mus-
kets in a cabin, and a great powder-horn, with about
four pounds of powder in it: as for the inuskets I
had no occasion for them, so l left them, but took
the powder-horn. I took a re-shovel and tongs,
which I wanted extreinely; as also two little brass
kettles, a copper pot to make chocolate, and a grid-
iron ; and with this cargo, and the dog, I came
away, the tide beginning to make home again: and
the same evening, about an hour within night, I
reached the island again, weary and fatigued to the
last degree.
I reposed that night in the boat-, and in the morn-
ing I resolved to harbour what I had gotten in my
new cave, not to carry it home to my castle. After
refreshing myself, I got all my cargo on shore, and
began to examine the particulars. The cask of
liquor I found to be a kind of rum, but not such as
wef had at the Brasils; and, in a word, not at all
good. But when I came to open the chests, I found
several things which I wanted: for example, I found
in one a ne case of bottles, of an extraordinary
kind, and lled with cordial waters, ne, and very
good: the bottles held about three pints "each, and
were tipped with silver. I found two pots of very
good succadcs, or sweetmeats, so fastened also on
top, that the salt water had notihurt them; and
two more of the same, which the water had spoiled.
I found some very good shirts, which were very wel-
come to me, and about a dozen and a half of white
linen handkerehiefs, and coloured neckcloths; the
former were also vex; welcome, being exceeding
refreshing to.wipe my face in a hot-day. Besides
this, when I "came to the till in the chests, I found
there three great bags of pieces of eight, which held
about eleven hundred pieces in all; and in one of
them, wrapt up in a paper, six doubloons of gold,
and some small bars of wedges of gold; I suppose
they might all weigh near a pound.
The other chest I found had some clothes in it,
but of little value; but by the circumstances it
must have belonged to the gunners mate, though
there was no powder in it, but about two pounds
of glazed powder, in three small asks, kept, I sup-
pose, for charging their fowling-pieces on occasion.
Upon the whole, I got very little by this voyage,
that was of much use to me; for, as to the money,
I had no manner of occasion for it, it was to me as
the dirt under my feet, and Lwould have given it
all for three or four pair of English shoes and stock-
ings;whieh were things I greatly wanted, but had not
had on my feet now for many years. I had, indeed,
gotten two pair of shoes now, which I took o‘ the
feet lof the two drowned men whom I saw in the
wreck; and I found two pair more in one of the
chests, which were very welcome to me ; but they
were not like our English shoes, either for ease or
service, being rather what we call pumps than shoes.
I found in this seaman’s chest about fty pieces of
eight in royals, but no gold: I suppose this belonged
to a poorer man than the other, which seemed to
belong to some ofcer.
Well, however, I lugged this money home to my
cave, and laid it up, as I had done that before,
which I brought from our own ship ; but it was great
pity, as I said, that the other part of the ship had
not come to my ‘share, for I am satised I might
have loaded my canoe several times over with mo-
ney, which, if I had ever escaped to England, would
have lien here safe enough till I might have come
again and fetched it."
Having now brought all my things on shore, and
secured them, Iiwent back to my boat, and rowed
or paddled her along the shore to her old harbour,
where I laid her up, and made the best of my way
to my old habitation, where I found every thing
safe and quiet; so I began to repose myself, live
after my old fashion, and take care of my family
affairs; and for a while I lived easy enough, only
that I was more vigilant than I used to be, looked
out oftener, and did not go abroad so much; and if
at any time I did stir with any freedom, it was
always to the east part of the island, where I was
pretty well satised the savages never came, and
where I could go without so many precautions, and
such a load of arms and ammunition as I always
carried with me, if I went the other way.
I lived in this condition near two years more; but
my unlucky head, that was always to let me know
it was born to make my body miserable, was all
those two years lled with projects anddesigns,
how, if it were possible, I might get away from this
island; for sometimes I was for making another
voyage to the wreck, though my reason told me,
that there was nothing left there worth the hazard
of my voyage; sometimes for a ramble one way,
sometimes another; and I believe verily, if I had
had the boat that I went from Sallee in, I should
have ventured to sea, bound any where, I knew not
whither. g
I have been, in all my circumstances, a memento
to those who are touched with that general plague
of mankind, whence, for aught 1 know, one half of
their miseries ow; I mean, that of not being satis-
ed with the station wherein God and nature hath
placed them. For, not to look hack upon my primi-
tive condition, and the excellent advice of my fa-
ther, the opposition to which was, as I may call it,
my original sin, my subsequent mistakes of the
same kind have been the means of my coming into
this miserable condition; for had that Providence,
which so happily had seated me at the Brasils, as a
planter, blessed me with conned desires, and could
I have been contented to have gone on gradually,
I might have been by this time, 1 mean in the time
of my being in this island, one of the most con-
siderable planters in the Brasils; nay, I am per-
suaded that, by the improvements I had made in
that little time I lived there, and the increase I
should probably have made, if I had staid, 1 might
have been worth a hundred thousand moidores. And
what business had I to leave a settled fortune, a
well stocked plantation, improving and increasing,
to turn supercargo to Guinea, to fetch Negroes,
when patience and time would have so increased
our stock at home, that we could have bought them
at our own doors, from those whose business it was
to fetch them? and though it had cost us something
more, yet the difference of that price was by no
means worth saving at so great a hazard.
But as this is ordinarily the fate of young heads,
so reection upon the folly of it, is as ordinarily
the exercise of more years, or of the dear-bought
experience of time; and so it was with me now:
and yet so deep had the mistake taken root in my
temper, that I could not satisfy myself in my sta-
tion, but was continually poring upon the means and
possibility of my escape from this place. And that
I may, with the greater pleasure to the reader,
bring on the remaining part of my story, it may
not be improper to give some account of my rst
conceptions on the subject of this foolish scheme
for my escape, and how, and upon what foundation,
I acted.
I am now to be supposed to be retired into my
castle, after my late voyage to the wreck, my frigate
laid up, and secured under water as usual, and my
condition restored to what it was before. I had
more wealth, indeed, than I had before, but was
not at all the richer; for I had no more use for it
than the Indians of Peru had before the Spaniards
came thither.
It was one of the nights, in the rainy season, in
March, the four-and-twentieth year of my rst set-
ting foot in this island of solitariness, I was lying
in my bed, or hammock, awake, very well in health,
had no pain, no distemper, no uneasiness of body,
no, nor any uneasiness of mind more than ordinary;
but could by no means close my eyes; that is, so
as to sleep, no, not a wink all ‘night long, otherwise
than as follows:
It is as impossible as needless to set_ down the
innumerable crowd of thoughts that whirled through
that great thoroughfare of the brain, the memory,
in this night's time. I ran over the whole history
of my life in min-iaturc, Ol‘- by abridgement, as I
may call it, to my coming to this island; and also
of that part of my life since I came to this island.
In my reections upon the state of my case, since I
came on shore on this island, I was comparing the
happy posture of my affairs, in the rst years of my
habitation here, to that course of anxiety, fear, and
care, which I had livedin ever since I had seen
the print of a foot in the sand. Not that I did not
believe the savages had frequented the island even
all the while, and might have been several hundreds
of them at times on shore there ; but as I had never
known it, and was incapable of any apprehensions
about it, my satisfaction was perfect, though my
danger was the same; and I was as happy in not
knowing my danger, as if I had never really been
exposed to it. This furnished my thoughts with
many very protable reections, and particularly;
this one, How innitely good that Providence is,
which has settled in. its government of mankind
such narrow bounds to his sight and knowledge of
things; and though he walks in the midst of so
many thousand dangers, the sight of which, if dis-
covered to him, would distract his mind, and sink
his spirits, he is kept serene and calm, -by. hav-
ing the events of things hid from his eyes, and
knowing nothing of the dangers which surround,
him. -
After these thoughts had for some time enter-
tained me, 1 came to reect seriously upon the real
danger I had been in for so many years in this very.
island; and how l had walked about in the greatest
security, and with all possible tranquillity, even
when perhaps nothing but a brow of a hill, a great
tree, or the casual approach of night, had been be-
tween me and the worst kind el’ destruction; viz.
that of falling into the hands ofcannibals and sa-
vages, who would have seized on me with the same
view as 1 did on a goat or a turtle, and have thought
it no more a crime to kill and devour me, than I
did‘ of a pigeon or a curlieu; I should unjustly
slander myself, if I should say I was not sincerely
thankful to my great Preserver, to whose singular
protection I acknowledged, with great humility,
that all these unknown deliverances were due, and-
without which 1 should inevitably have fallen into
their merciless hands.
When these thoughts were over, my head was for
some time taken up in considering the nature of
these wretched creatures, l mean, the savages; and
how it came to pass in the world, that the wise
Governor of all things should give up any of his
creatures to such inhumanity, nay, to something so
much below even brutality itself, as to devour its
o\vn kind. But as this ended in seine (at that time
fruitless) speculations, it occurred to me to inquire
what part of the world these wretches lived in;
how far oif the coast was from whence they came;
what they ventured over so far from home for;
what kind of boats they had; and why l might
not order myself, and my business so, that I might
he as able to go over thither, as they were to come
to me.
I never so much as troubled myself to consider
what I should do with myself when I came thither;
what should become of me, if I fell into the hands
of the savages; or how I should escape from them,
if they attempted me; no, nor so much as how it
was possible for me to reach the coast, and not be
attempted by seine or other of them, without any
possibility of delivering myself; and ifl should not
fall into their hands, what I should do for pro-
vision, or whither 1 should bend my course; none
of these thoughts, I say, so much as came in my
Way; but my mind was wholly bent upon the no-
tion of my passing over in my boat to the main
land. I looked hack upon my present condition, as
the most miserable that could possibly be; that I
was not able to throw myself into any thing but
death that could be called worse; that ifl reached
the shore of the main, I might, perhaps, meet with
relief; or 1 might coast along, as I did on the shore
of Africa, till I came to some inhabited country,
and wherovl might nd some relief; and after all,
perhaps, I might fall in with some Christian ship
that might take me in; and if the worst came to
the worst. I could but die, which would put an end
to all these miserieslat once. Pray note, all this
was the fruit of a disturbed mind, an impatient
temper, made, as it were, desperate by the long
continuance of my troubles, and the disappoint-
ments I had met in the wreck I had been on board
of, and where I had been so near the obtaining what
I so earnestly longed for, viz. somebody to speak to,
and to learn some knowledge from, of the place
where I was, and of the probable means of my de-
liverance; I say, I was agitated wholly by these
thoughts. All my calm of mind, in my resignation
to Providence, and waiting the issue of the disposi-
tions of Heaven, seemed to be suspended; and I
had, as it were, no power to turn my thoughts to
any thing, but the project of a voyage to the main,
“which came upon me with such force, and such an
impetuosity of desire, that it was not to be resisted.
When this had agitated my thoughts, for two hours
or more, with such violence, that it set my very
blood into a ferment, and my pulse beat as high as
if I had been in a fever, merely with the extraor-
dinary fervour of my mind about it; nature, as if
I had been fatigued and exhausted with the very
thought of it, threw me into a sound sleep. One
would have thought I should have dreamed of it;
but I did not, nor of any thing relating to it: but I
dreamed, that as I wasgoing out in the morning, as
usual, from my castle, I saw upon the shore two
canoes, and elevenysavages coming to land, and that
they brought with them-another savage, whom they
were going to kill, in order to eat him, when, on
a sudden, the savage that they were going to kill,
jumped away, and ran for his life : then I thought, in
my sleep, that he came running into my little thick
grove, before my fortication, to hide himself; and
that Iseeing him alone, and not perceiving that the
others sought him that way, showed myself to him,
and smiling upon him, encouraged him: that he kneel-
ed down to me, seeming to pray to me to assist him;
upon which I showed my ladder, made him go upon
it, and carried him into my cave, and he became my
servant; and that as soon as I had gotten this man, I
said to myself, ‘ Now I may certainly venture to the
main land ; for this 'fellow» will serve me as a pilot,
and will tell me what to do, and whither to go for
provisions, and whither not to go for fear of being
devoured, what places to venture into, and what to
escape.’ I waked with this thought, and was under
such inexpressible impressions of joy at the pro-
spect of my escape in my dream, that the dis-
appointments which I felt upon coming to myself,
and nding it was no more than a dream, were
equally extravagant the other way, and threw me
into a very great dejection of spirit.
Upon this, however, I made this conclusion, that
my only way to go about an attempt for an escape,
was, if possible, to get a savage in my possession;
and, if possible, it should be one of their prisoners,
whom they had condemned to be eaten, and should
bring hither to kill; but these thoughts still were
attended with this diiculty, that it was impossible
to effect this, without attacking a whole caravan of
them, and killing them all; and this was not only
a very desperate attempt, and might miscarry, but,
on the other hand, l had greatly serupled the law-
fulness of it to me, and my heart trembled at the
thoughts of shedding so much blood, though it was
for my deliverance. I need not repeat the argu-
ments which .occurred to me against this, they being
the same mentioned before: but though I had other
reasons to offer now ; viz. that those men were ene-
mies to my life, and would devour me,_ if they could;
that it was self-preservation, in the highest degree,
to deliver myself from this death of a life, and was
acting in my own defence, as much as if they were
actually assaulting me, and the like; I say, though
these things argued for it, yet the thoughts of shed-
ding‘ human blood for my deliverance, were very ter-
ribl.e to me, and such as I could by no means recon-
cile myself to a great while.
However, at last, after many secret disputes with
myself, and after great perplexities about it (for all
these arguments, one way and another, struggled in
my head a long time), the eager prevailing desire of
deliverance at length mastered all the rest, and I
resolved, if possible, to get one of these savages
into my hands, cost what it would. My next thing
then was to contrive how to do it; and this indeed
was very difficult to resolve on: but as I could
pitch upon no probable means for it, so I resolved
to put myself upon the watch, to see them when
they came on shore, and leave the rest to the event,
taking such measures as the opportunity should pre-
sent, let be what would be.
With these resolutions in my thoughts, I set my-
self uponthe scout, as often as possible, and indeed
so often, till I was heartily tired of it; for it was
above a year and a half that I waited, and for a
great part of that time went out to the west end,
and to the south-west corner of the island, almost
every day, to see the canoes; but none appeared.
This was very discouraging, and began to trouble
me much; though I cannot say that it did in this
case, as it had done some time before that; viz.
wear off the edge of my desire to the thing; but
the longer it seemed to be delayed, the more eager
I was for it. In a word, I was not at rst more care-
ful to shun the sight of these savages, and avoid
being seen by them, than I was now eager to be
upon them.
Besides, I fancied myself able to manage one,
nay, two or three savages, if I had them, so as to
make them entirely slaves to me, to do whatever I
should direct them, and to prevent their being able,
at any time to do me any hurt. It was agreat while
that I pleased myself with this affair; but nothing
still presented; all my fancies and schemes came to
nothing, for no savages came near meforagreat while.
About a year and a half after I had entertained
these notions, and, by long musing, had, as it were,
resolved them all into nothing, for want of an oc-
casion to put them into execution, I was surprised
one morning early, with seeing no less than ve
canoes, all on shore together, on my side the island,
and the people who belonged to them all landed,
and out of my sight. The number of them broke
all my measures ; for seeing so many, and knowing
that they always came four or six, or sometimes
more, in a boat, I could not tell what to think of
it, or how to take my measures to attack twenty or
thirty men single-handed‘; so I lay still in my
castle, perplexed and discomforted. However, I put
myself into all the same postures for an attack, that
I had formerly provided, and was just ready for
action, if any thing had presented. Having waited
a good while, listening to hear if they made any
noise, at length, being very impatient, I set my
guns at the foot of my ladder, and clambered up to
the top of the hill by my two stages, as usual;
standing so, however, that my head did not appear
above the hill; so that they could not perceive me,
by any means. I-Iere I observed, by the help of my
perspective glass, that they were no less than thirty
in number, that they had a re kindled, and that
they had had meat dressed: how they cooked it,
that 1 know not, or what it was; but they were all
dancing, in I know not how many barbarous ges-
tures and gures, their own way, round the re.
While I was thus looking on them, I perceived,
by my perspective, two miserable wretches dragged
from the boats, where, it seems, they were laid by,
and were now brought out for the slaughter. I per-
ceived one of them immediately fell, being knocked
down, l suppose, M94’ a club or wooden sword, for
that was their way, and two or three others were
at work immediately, cutting him open for their
cookery while the other victim was left standin"
by himself, till they should be ready for him. 13
that very moment this poor wretch seeing himself
a little at liberty, nature inspired him with hopes of
life, and he started away from them, and ran with
incredible swiftness along the sands, directly to-
wards me, I mean, towards that part of the coast
where my habitation was. . _
I was dreadfully frighted (that I must acknow-
ledge), when I “perceived him to run my way ; and
especially when‘, as I thought, I saw him pursued
by the whole body; and now I expected that part
of my dream was coming to pass, and that he would
certainly take shelter in my grove; but I could not
depend, by any means, upon my dream for the rest
of it, viz. that the other savages would not pursue
him thither, and nd him there. However, I kept
my station,. and my spirits began to recover, when I
found that there were not above three men that
followed him;_ and still more was I encouraged,
when 1 found that he outstripped.them exceedingly
in running, and gained ground of them, so that if he
could but hold it out for halfan hour, I saw easily
he would fairly get away from them all.
There was between them and my castle the creek,
which I mentioned often at the rst part of my
story, when I landed my cargoes out of the ship ;
and this I knew he must necessarily swim over, or
the poor wretchwould-v be taken there: but when
the savage escaping came thither, he made nothing
of it, though the_tide was then up; but, plunging
in, swam through, in about thirty strokes, or there-
abouts, landed, and ran on with exceeding strength
and swiftness. When the three pursuers came to
the creek, I found that two of them could swim,
but the third could not, and that he standing on
the other,side, looked at the other, but went no
farther; and soon after went softly back again,
which, as it happened, was very well for him in the
main. '
I observed that the two who swam, were yet more
than twice as long swimming over the creek, than
thefellow was that ed from them. It came now
very warmly upon my thoughts, and indeed irresis-
tibly, that now was my time to get me a servant,
and, perhaps, a companion or assistant, and that I
was called plainly, by Providence, to save this poor
creature’s life. I immediately got down the lad-
ders, with all possible expedition, fetched my two
guns, for they were both at the foot of the ladders,
as I observed above ; and getting up again with the
same haste to the top of the hill, I crossed towards
the sea; and, having avery short cut, and all down
hill, clapped myself in the way between the pur-
suers and the pursued, hollowing aloud to him that
fled, who, looking back, was at rst perhaps as much
frighted at me, as at them; but I beckoned with
my hand to him to come back, and, in the mean
time, I slowly advanced towards the two that fol-
lowed; then rushing at once upon the foremost, I
knocked him down with the stock of my piece: I
was loath to re, because I would not have the rest
hear; though at that distance it would not have
been easily heard; and being out of sight of the
smoke too, they would not have easily known what
to make of it. Having knocked this fellow down,
the other who pursued him stopped, as if he had
been frightened, and I advanced apace towards
him ; but as I came nearer, I perceived presently
he had a bow and arrow, and was tting it to shoot
at me; so I was then necessitated to shoot at him
rst, which I did, and killed him at the rst shot.
The poor savage wlio..ed, but had stopped, though
he saw both his enemies fallen, and killed (as he
thought), yet was so frighted with the re and noise
of my piece, that he stood stock-still, and neither
came forward, nor went backward, though he
seemed rather inclined to y still, than to come
on. I hollowed again to him, and made signs to
come forward, which he easily understood, and
came a little way, then stopped again, and then a
little farther, and stopped again, and_I could then
perceive that he stood trembling, as if he had been
taken prisoner, and had just been to be killed, as
his two enemies were. I beckoned him again to
come to me, and gave him all the signs of encou-
ragement that I could think of; and he_ came nearer
and nearer, kneeling down every ten or twelve
steps, in token of acknowledgement for saving his
life. I smiled at him, and looked pleasantly, and
beckoned to him to come still nearer. At length
he came close to me, and then he kneeled down
again, kissed the ground, and laid his head upon
the ground, and taking me by the foot, set my foot
upon his head: this, it seems, was in token of
swearing to be my slave for ever. I took him up,
and made much of him, and encouraged him all I
could. But there was more work to do yet; for
I perceived the savage whom I knocked down was
not killed, hut stunned with the blow, and began to
come to himself. So 1 pointed to him, and showing
him the savage, that he was not dead; upon this he
spoke some wordsto me, and though I could not
understand them, yet I thought they were pleasant
to hear, for they were the rst sound of a man's
voice that I had heard, my own excepted,‘ for above
ve-and-twenty years. But there was no time for
such reections now. The savage who was knocked
down, recovered himself so far as to sit up upon
the ground; and I perceived that my savage began
to be afraid: but when I saw that, I presented my
other piece at the man, as if I would shoot him;
upon this my savage, for so I call him now, made a
motion to me to lendhim my sword, which hung
naked in abeltby my side; so I did. Isle no sooner
had it, but he runs to his enemy, and, at one blow,
cut off his head as cleverly, no executioner in Ger-
many could have done it sooner or better; which I
thought very strange for one, who, I had reason to
believe, never saw a sword. in his life before, except
their own wooden swords. However, it seems, as I
learned afterwards, they make their wooden swords’
so sharp,» so heavy, and the wood is so hard, that
they will cut oil‘ heads even with them, ay, and
arms, and that at one blow too. When he had
done this, he comes laughing to me in sign of
triumph, and brought me the sword again, and, with
abundance of gestures, which I did not understand,
laid it down, with the head of the savage that he
had killed, just before me.
But that which astonished him most was to know
how I had killed the other Indian so far off ; so
pointing to him, he made signs to me to let him go
to him; so I bade him go, as well as I could. When
he came to him, he stood like one amazed, looking
at him; turned him rst on one side, then on the
other; looked at the wound the bullet had made,
which, it seems, was just in his breast, where it had
made a hole, and no great quantity of blood had
followed, but he had bled inwardly, for he was
quite dead. Then he took up his bow and arrows,
and came back ; so I turned to go away, and beck-
oned to him to follow me, making signs to him
that more might come after them.
Upon this, he signed to me, that he should bury
them with sand, that they might not be seen by the
rest, if they followed; and so I made signs again
to. him to do so : he fell to work, and, in an instant,
he scraped a hole in the sand with his hands, big
enough to bury the rst in, and then dragged him
into it, and covered him; and did so also by the
other. I believe he had buried them both in a quar-
ter of an hour; then calling him away, I carried
him not to my castle, but quite away to my cave, on
the farther part of the island: sol did not let my
dream come to pass in that part; viz. that he came
into my grove for shelter.
Here I gave him bread, and a bunch of raisins to
eat, and a draught of water, which I found he was
indeed in great distress for, by his running; and
having refi-eslied him, I made signs for him to go
lie down and sleep, pointing to a place where I had
' L
laid a great parcel of rice straw, and a blanket upon
it, which I used to sleep upon myself sometimes:
so the poor creature lay down, and went to sleep.
I-Ie was a comely, handsome fellow; perfectly well
made, with straight, long limbs. not too large; tall,
and well shaped; and, as I reckon, about twenty-six
years of age. Ile had a very good countenance;
not a erce and surly aspect, but seemed to have
something very manly in his face, and yet he had
all the sweetness and softness of an European in
his countenance too, especially when he smiled.
His hair was long and black, not curled like wool;
his forehead very high, and large, and a great viva-
city and sparkling sharpness in his eyes. The co-
lour of his skin was not quite black, but very
tawny, and yet not of an ugly, yellow, nauseous
tawny, as the Brasili-ans, and Virginians, and other
natives of America are, but of a bright kind of a
dun olive colour, that had in it something very
agreeable, though not very easy to describe. His
face was round and plump, his nose small, not llat
like the Negroes, a very goodmouth, thin lips, and
his teeth ne, well set, and white as ivory. After
he had slumbcred, rather than slept, about half an
hour, he waked again, and comes out of the cave to
me, for l had been milking my goats which I had in
the enclosure just by. When he espied me, he came
running to me, laying himself down again upon the
ground, with all the possible signs of a humble,
thankful disposition, making many antic gestures
to show it. At last he lays his head at upon the
ground, close to my foot, and sets my other foot
upon his head, as he had done before; and after
this, made all the signs to me of subjection, servi-
tudc, and submission imaginable, to let me know
how much he would servo me as long as he lived.
I understood him in many things, and let him
know I was very well pleased with him. In a little
time I began to speak to him, and teach him to
speak to mo ; and rst, I made him know his name
should be Friday, which was the day I saved his
life; and I called him so for the memory of the
time: I likewise taught him to say, ‘ Master,’ and
then let him know that was to be my name. I like-
wise taught him to say, ‘ Yes’ and ‘ No,’ and to
know the meaning of them. I gave him some milk
in an earthen pot, and let him see me drink it be-
fore him, and sop my bread in it; and I gave him
a cake of bread to do the like, which he quickly
complied with, and made signs that it was very good
for him.
I kept there with him all that night; but as soon
as it was day, I beckoned him to come with me,
and let him know I would give him some clothes;
at which he seemed very glad, for he was stark
naked. As we went by the place where we had
buried the two men, he pointed exactly to the spot,
and showed me the marks that he had made to
nd them again, making signs to me that we should
dig them up again, and eat them: at this I ap-
peared very angry, expressed my abhorrence of it,
made as if I would vomit at the thoughts of it, and
beckoned with my hand to him to come away,
which he did immediately, with great submission.
I then led him up to the top of the hill, to see if
his enemies were gone, and pulling out my glass, I
looked, and saw plainly the place where they had
been, but no appearance of them, or of their ca-
noes; so that it was plain that they were gone, and
had left their two comrades behind them, without
any search after them.
But I was not content with this discovery; but,
having now more courage, and consequently more
curiosity, I took my man Friday with me, giving
him the sword in his hand, with the bow and ar-
rows at his back, which I found he could use very
dexterously, making him carry one gun For me, and
I two for myself, and away we marched to the
place where these creatures had been; for I had a
mind now to get some fuller intelligence of them.
Vi/hen I came to the place, my very blood ran chill
in my veins, and my heart sunk within me at the
horror of the spectacle. Indeed it was a dreadful
sight, at least it was so Lo me, though Friday made
nothing of it: the place was covered with human
bones, the ground dyed with the blood, great pieces
of flesh left,‘ here and there, half eaten, mangled,
and scorched; and, in short, all the tokens of the
triumphant feast they had been making there, after
avictory over the enemies. I saw‘ three skulls, live
hands, and the bones of three or four legs and
feet, and abundance of other parts of the bodies:
and Friday, by his signs, made me understand,
that they brought over four prisoners to feast upon;
that three of them were eaten up, and that he,
pointing to himself, was the fourth; that there had
been a great battle between them and their next
king, whose subjects, it seems, he had been one of;
and that they had taken a great number of prison-
ers, all which were carried to several places by those
that had taken them in the ght, in order to feast
upon them, as was done here by these wretches
upon those they brought hither.
I caused Friday to gather all the skul-ls, bones,
flesh, and whatever remained, and lay them toge-
ther on a heap, and make a great lire upon it, and
burn them all to ashes. I found Friday had still
a hankering stomach after some of the esh, and
was still a cannibal in his nature; but I discovered
so much abhorrence at the very thoughts ol’ it, and
at the least appearance of it, that he durst not dis.
cover it; for I had, by some means, let him know,
that I would kill him if he offered it.
When we had done this, we came back to our
castle, and there I fell to work for my man '["riday.
And rst of all, 1 gavehim a pair of linen drawers,
which I had out of the poor gunner's chest I men-
tioned, and which I found in the wreck; and which,
with a little alteration, tted him very well. then
I made him lavjerkin of goat’s skin, as well as my
skill would allow, and I was now grown a tolerable
good tailor;,and I gave him a cap, which I had
made of a hare-skin, very convenient, and fashion-
able enough: and thus he was dressed, for the pre-
sent, tolerabl y well; and mighty well was he pleased
to see himself almost as well clothed as his master.
It is true, he went awkwardly in these things at
rst: wearing the drawers was very awkward to
him; and the sleeves of the waistcoat galled his
shoulders, and the inside of his arms; but a little
easing, them where he complained they hurt him,
and using himself to them, at length he took to
them very well. “
The next day after I came home to my hutch
with him, I began to consider where I should lodge
him; and that I might do well for him, and yet be
perfectly easy myself, I made a little tent for him,
in the vacant place between my two fortications,
in the inside of the last, and in the outside of the
rst: and as there was a door or entrance there
into my cave, I made a formal framed door-case,
and a door to it of boards, and set it up in the pas-
sage, a little within the entrance; and, causing the
door to open on the inside, I barred it up in the
night, taking in my ladders too; so that Friday
could no way come at me in the inside of my in.
nermost wall, without making so much noise in get;
ting over, that it must needs awaken me; for my
rst wall had now a complete roof over it of long
poles, covering all my tent, and leaning up to the
side of the hill, which was again laid cross with
small sticks instead of laths, and then thatched over
a great thickness with the rice straw. which was
strong like reeds; and at the hole or place which
was left to go in or out by the ladder, l had placed
a kind of trap-door, which, if it had been attempted
on the outside, would not have opened at all, but
would have fallen down, and made a great noise:
and as to weapons, I took them all in to my side
every night,
' But I needed none of all this precaution; for
never man had a more faithful, loving, sincere ser-
vant than Friday was to me; without passions, sul-
lenness, or designs; perfectly obliged and engaged;
his very affections were tied to me, like those of a
child to a father; and, I dare say, he would have
sacriced his life for the saving mine, upon any oc~
casion whatsoever. The many testimonies he gave
me of this, put it out of doubt ; and soon convinced
me, that I needed to use no precautions as to my
safety on his account.
This frequently gave me occasion to observe, and
that with wonder, that, however it had pleased God
in his providence, and in the government of the
works of his hands, to take from so great a part of
the world of his creatures, the best uses to which
their faculties, and the powers of their souls, are
adapted; yet that he has bestowed upon them the
same powers, the same reason, the same affections,
the same sentiments of kindness and obl'1gati0n, the
same passions and resentments of wrongs, the same
sense of gratitude, sincerity, delity, and all the
capacities of doing good, and receiving good, that
he has given to us; and that when he pleases to
offer them occasions of exerting these, they are as
ready, nay, more ready to apply them to the right
uses for which they were bestowed, than we are.
And this made me very melancholy sometimes, in
reecting, as the several occasions presented, how
mean a use we- make of all these, even though we
have these powers enliglitened by the great lamp of
instruction, the. Spirit of God, and by the know-
ledge of his word, added to our understanding; and
why it has pleased God to hide the like saving
knowledge from so many millions of souls, who, if I
might iudge by this poor savage, would make a
much better use of it than we did.
From hcnce I sometimes was led too far to invade
the sovereignty of I’rov~ideuce, and, as it were, ar-
raign the justice of so arbitrary a disposition of
things, that should hide that light from some, and
reveal it to others, and yet expect a like duty from
both. But I shut it up, and checked my thoughts
with this conclusion; rst, That we did not know
by what light and law these should be condemned ;
but that as God was necessarily, and by the nature
of his being, infinitely holy and just, so it could
not be, but that if these creatures were all sentenced
to absence from himself, it was on account of sin-
ning against that light, which, as the Scripture says,
was a law to themselves, and by such rules as their
consciences would acknowledge to be just, though
the foundation was not discovered to us: and, se-
condly, That still, as we are all the clay in the
hand of the potter, no vessel could say to him,
‘ Why hast thou formed me thus ?’
.But to return to my new companion: I was
greatly delighted with him, and made it my busi-
ness to teach him every thing that was proper to
make him useful, handy, and helpful; but espe-
cially to make him speak, and understand me when
I spake; and he was the aptest scholar that ever
was, and particularly was so merry, so constantly
diligent, and so pleased when he could but under-
stand me, or make me understand him, that it was
very pleasant to me to talk to him. And now my
life began to he so easy, that I began to say to my-
self, that could I but have been safe from more sa~
vages, I cared not if I was never to remove from the
place while I lived.
After I had been two or three days returned to
my castle, I thought, that, in order to bring Friday
off from his horrid way of feeding, and from the
relislrof a cannibal‘s stomach, I ought to let him
taste other esh. So .I took him out with me one
morning to the woods; I- went, indeed. intending to
kill a kid out of my own tlock. and bring it home
and dress it: but, as l was going, I saw a slie-goat,
lying down in the shade, and two young kids sitting
by her. I catchcd hold of Friday; ‘ Hold,’ said I :
‘ stand still ;’ and made signs to him not to stir:
immediately I presented my piece, shot, and killed
one of the kids. ’].‘he poor creature who had, at a
distance, indeed, seen me kill the savage, his enemy,
but did not know, nor could imagine, how it was
done, was sensibly surprised, trembled, and shook,
and looked so amazed, that I thought he would
have sunk down. He did not see the kid I had
shot at, nor perceive I had killed it, but ripped up
his waistcoat to feel if he was not wounded; and,
as 'l' found, presently thought I was resolved to
kill him; for he came and kneeled down to me,
and, embracing my knees, said a great many things
I did not understand, but 1 could easily see, that
his meaning was to pray me not to kill him.
I soon found a way to convince him, that I would
do him no harm; and, taking him up by the hand,
laughed at him, and, pointing to the kid which I
had killed, beckoned to him to run and fetch it,
which he did; and while he was wondering and
looking to see how the creature was killed, I loaded
my gun again, and by-and-by I saw a great fowl,
like a hawk, sit upon a tree within shot; so, to let
Friday understand a little what I would do, I
called him to me again, pointing at the fowl, which
was indeed a parrot, though I thought it had been
:1 hawk; I say, pointing to the parrot, and to my
gun, and to the ground under the parrot, to let him
see I would make him fall, I made him understand
that I would shoot and kill that bird: accordingly
I red, and bade him look, and immediately he
saw the parrot fall. I-Ie stood like one frighted
again, notwithstanding all that I had said to him;
and I found he was the more amazed, beuw be
did not see me put any thing“'intn the gun; but
thought. there must be some wonderful fund of
death and destruction in that thing, able to kill man,
beast, bird, or any thing near or far off; for the
astonishment this created in him was such as could
not wear elf for a long time; and I believe, if I
would have let him, he would have worshipped me
and my gun: as for the gun itself, he would not so
much as touch it for several days after ; but would
speak to it, and talk to it, as if it had answered him,
when he was by himself, which, as I afterwards
learned of him, was to desire it not to kill him.
Well, after his astonishment was a little over at
this, I pointed to him to run and fetch the bird I
had shot, which he did, but staid some time; for
the parrot, not being quite dead, was uttered a
good way off from the place where she fell. How-
ever, he found her, took her up, and brought her to
me; and, as I had perceived his ignorance about
the gun before, I took this advantage to charge the
gun again, and not let him see me do it, that I
might be ready for any other mark that might pre-
sent; but nothing more offered at that time. So I
brought home the kid, and the same evening I
took the skin o’, and cut it out as well as I could;
and, having a pot for that purpose, I boiled or
stewed some of the esh, and made some very good
broth: after I had begun to eat some, I gave some
to my man, who seemed very glad of it, and liked
it very well; but that which was strangest to him
was to see me eat salt with it. I-Ie made a sign to
me, that the salt was not good to eat, and putting a
little into his own mouth, he seemed to nauseate it,
and would spit and sputter at it, washing his mouth
with fresh water after it; on the other hand, I took
some meat in my mouth without salt, and I pre-
tended to spit and sputter for want of salt, as fast
as he had done at the salt: hut it would not do, he
would never. care for salt with meat, or in his broth,
at least, not a great while, and then but a very little.
Having thus l"ed him with boiled lneat and broth,
I was resolved to feast him the next day with roast-
ing a piece of the kid : this l did by hanging it before
the lire in a string, as l had seen many people do in
England, setting two poles up, one on each side the
re, and one cross on the top, and tying the string
L 2
to the cross stick, letting the meat turn c<ml;i1iu~
ally. This Friday admired very much; but when
he came to taste the esh, he took so many ways
to tell me how well he liked it, that I could not
but understand him: and, at last, he told me he
would never eat man’s esh any more, which I was
very glad to hear. I
The next day I set him to work to beating some
corn out, and sifting it in the manner I used to do,
as I observed before; and he soon understood how
to do it as well as I, especially after he hadseen
what the meaning of it was, and that it was to make
bread of; for after that I let him sec me make my
bread, and bake it too; and in a little time Fri-
day was able to do all the work for me, as well as I
could doit myself.
I began now to consider, that, having two mouths
to feed instead of one, I must provide more ground
for my harvest, and plant a larger quantity of corn
than I used to do ; so I marked out a larger piece
of land, and began the fence in the same manner as
before, in which Friday not only worked very will-
ingly, and very hard, but did it very cheerfully;
and I told him what it was for, that it was for corn
to make more bread, because he was now with me,
and that I might have enough for him and myself
too. I-Ie appeared very sensible of that part, and
let me know that he thought I had much more la-
bour upon me on his account, than I had for my-
self, and that he would work the harder for me, if I
would tell him what to do.
This was the pleasantest year of all the life I led
in this place. Friday began to talk pretty well, and
understand the names of almost every thing I had
occasion to call for, and of every placel had to
send him to, and talk a great deal to me; so that,
in short, I began now to have some use for my
tongue again, which indeed I had very little occa-
sion for before ; that is to say,.ab0ut~ speech. Be-
sides the pleasure of talking to him, I had a singu-
lar satisfaction in the fellow himself: his simple,
unfeigned honesty appeared to me more and more
every day, and 1 began really to love the creature;
and on. his side, I believe he loved me more than
it was possible for him ever to love any thing be-I
fore.
I had a mind once to try if he had any hankering
inclination to his own country again; and having
learned him English so well, that he could answer
me almost any questions, I asked him whether the
nation that he belonged to never conquered in
battle. At which he smiled, and said, ‘ Yes, yes;
we always ght the better;’ that is, he meant,
always get the better in ght: and so we began
the following discourse. ‘ You always ght the
better!’ said I: ‘ I-Iow came you to be taken pri-
soner then, Friday?’
Friday. My nation beat much for all that.
M¢zst'er. I-Iow beat? If your nation beat them,
how came you to be taken?
Friday. They more than my nation in the place
where me was: they take ‘one, two, three, and me.
My nation over-beat them in the yonder place,
where me no was: there my nation take one, two,
great thousand. :
Master. But why did not your side recover you
from the hands of your enemies then ?
Friday. They run one, two, three, and me, and
make go in the canoe: my nation have no canoe
that time.
Master. Well, Friday, and what does your nation
do with the men they take? Do they carry them
away, and eat them, as these did?
Friday. Yes, my nation eat mans too, eat all up.
Master. Where do they carry them ?
Friday. Go to other place where they think.
Mrastcr. ])o they come hither?
Friday. Yes, yes, they come hither; come other
else place.
Jastcr. Have you been here with them?
Fridag/. Yes, I been here. (Points to the N. W.
side of the island, which, it seems, was their side.)
By this I understood that my man Friday had
l‘ornierly been among the savages, who used to come
on shore, on the farther part of the island, on the
said man-eating occasions that he was now brought
for; and some time after, when I took courage to
carry him to that side, being the same I formerly
mentioned, he presently knew the place, and told
me, he was there once when they eat up twenty
men, two women, and one child: he could not tell
twenty in English, but he numbered them by laying
so many stones sin a row, and pointing to me to tell
them over. _
I have told this passage, because it introduces
what follows: that, after I had had this discourse
with him, I asked him how far it was from our island
to -the shore, and whether the canoes were not often
lost. He told me there was no danger, no canoes
ever lost; but that, after a little way out to sea,
there was a current, and a wim‘al\vays one way in
the morning, the other in the afternoon.
'.l‘his I understand to be no more than the sets of
the tide, as going out, or coming in; but I after-
wards understood it was occasioned by the great
draught and reux of the mighty river Oroonoque;
in the mouth of which river, as I thought after-
wards, our island-lay; and that this land, which I
perceived to the W. and N.W. was the great island
Trinidad, on the north point of the mouth of the
river. 1 asked Friday a thousand questions about
the country, the inhabitants, the sea, the coast, and
what nations were near: he told me all he knew,
with the greatest openness imaginable. I asked’
him the names of the several nations of his sort of
people, but could get no other name than Caribs;
from whence 1 easily understood, that these were
the Caribbees, which our maps place on that part of
America which reaches-from the mouth of the river
Oroonoque to Guiana, and onwards to St. Martha.
Ho told me, that up a great way beyond the moon,
that was, beyond the setting of the moon, which
must be west from their country, there dwelt white,
bearded men, like me, and pointed to my great
whiskers, which I mentioned before; and that they
had killed ‘ much mans,’ that was his word. By
all which I understood he meant the Spaniards,
whose cruelties in America had been spread over
the whole countries, and were remembered by all
the nations from father to son,
I inquired if he could tell me how I might come
from this island, and get among those white men:
he told me, yes, yes, 1 might go in ‘ two canoe.’ I
could not understand what he meant by ‘ two
canoe,’ till at last, with great diieulty,~ I found he
meant, that it must be in a large, great boat, as big
as two canoes.
This part of Friday’s discourse began to relish
with me very well; and from this time I entertained
some hopes, that, one time or other, I might nd an
opportunity to make my escape from this place, and
that this poor savage might be a means to help me
to do it.
During the long time that Friday had now been
with me, and that he began to speak to inc, and
understand me, I was not wanting to lay a foun-
dation of religious knowledge in his mind; particu-
larly 1 asked him one time, who made him. The
poor creature did not understand me at all, but
thought I had asked who was his father. But I
took it by another handle, and asked him, who made
the sea, the ground he walked on, and the hills and
woods. He told me, it was one old Bcnamuckee,
that lived beyond all. I-Ie could describe nothing
of this great person, but that he was very old;
much older, he said, than the sea or the land, than
the moon or the stars. I asked him then, if this
old person had made all things, Why did not all
things worship him. Ile looked very grave, and
with a perfect look of innocence, said, ‘ All things
230 ' nonmson causes.
1
said O" to him.’ I asked him if the people who die
in his country went away any where. He said,
yes, they all went to Benamuckee. Then I asked
him, whether those theyieat up went thither too:
he said, ‘ Yes.’
From these things I began to instruct him in the
knowledge of the true God. l told him, that the
great Maker of all things lived up there, pointing
up towards heaven: that he governs the world by
the same power and providence by which he had
made it: that he was omnipotent, could do every
thing for us, give every thing to us, -take every
thing from us ; and thus, by degrees, I opened his
eyes. ‘He listened with great attention, and re-
ceived with pleasure the notion of Jesus Christ
being sent to redeem us, and of themanner of mak-
ing our prayers to God, and his being able to hear
us, even into heaven. He told me one day, that if
our God could hear us up beyond the sun, he must
needs be a greater God than their Benamuckce, who
lived but a little way off, and yet could not hear,
till they went up to the great mountains where he
dwelt, to speak to him. I asked him, if ever he
went thither to speak to him: he said, no; they
never went that were young men; none went
thither but the old men, whom he called their Oo-
wokakee, that is, as I made him explain it to me,
their religious, or clergy; and that they went to
say O (so he called saying prayers), and then came
back, and told them what Benamuckee said. By
this I observed, that there is priestcraft even amongst
the most blinded ignorant Pagans in the world ; and
the policy of making a secret religion, in order to
preserve the veneration of the people to the clergy,
is not only to be found in the Roman, but perhaps
among all religions in the world, even among the
most brutish and barbarous savages. .
I endeavoured to clear up this fraud to my man
Friday, and told him, that the pretence of their
old men going up to the mountains to say O to their
god Benamuckee, was a cheat; and their bringing
word from thence what he said, was much more so ;
that if they met with any answer, or spoke with any
one there, it must be with an evil spirit: and then
I entered into a long discourse with him about the
devil, the original of him, his rebellion against God,
his enmity to man, the reason of it, his setting him-
self up in the dark parts of the world to be wor-
shipped instead of God, and as God, and the many
stratagems he made use of, to delude mankind to
their ruin; how he had a secret access to our pas-
sions, and to our affections, to adapt his snares so to
our inclinations, as to cause us even to be our own
tempters,. and to run upon our own destruction, by
our own choice.
I found it was not so easy to imprint right no-
tions in his mind about the devil, as it was about
the being of a God. Nature assisted all my argu-
ments to evidence to him even the necessity of a
great First Cause, and over-ruling, governing power,
asecret, directing providence, and of -the equity and
justice of paying homage to him that made us, and
the like: but there appeared nothing of all this in
the notion. of an evil spirit, of his original, his
being, his nature, and, above all, of his inclination
to do evil, and to draw usin to do so too. And the
poor creature puzzled me once in such a manner, by
a question merely natural and innocent, that I
scarce knew what to say to him. I had been talk-
ing a great deal to him of the power of God, his
omnipotence, his dreadfulaversion to sin, his being
a consuming re to the workers of iniquity; how,
as he had made us all, he could destroy us, and all
the world, in a moment: and he listened with great
seriousness to me all the while.
After this, I had been telling him how the devil
was God's enemy in the hearts of men, and used all
his malice and skill to defeat the good designs of
Providence, and to ruin the kingdom of Christ in
the world, and the like: ‘ Well,’ says Friday, ' but
you say, God is so strong, so great, is he not much
strong, much might, as the devil ?’ ‘ Yes, yes,’ said
I, ‘ Friday, God is stronger than the devil, God
is above the devil, and therefore we pray to God
to tread him under our feet, and enable us to re-
sist his temptations, and quench his ery darts.’
‘ But,’ says he again, ‘ if God much strong, much
might, as the devil, why God not kill the devil ,so
make him no more wicked ?’
I was strangely surprised at his question, and
after all, though I was now an old man, yet I was
but a young doctor, and ill enough qualied for a
casuist, or a solver of difculties: and, at rst, I
could not tell what to say; so I pretended not to
hear him, and asked him what he said. But he
was too earnest for an answer to forget his que-
stion, so that he repeated it in the very same broken
words as above. By this time I had recovered my-
self a little, and I said, ‘God will at last punish
him severely ; he is reserved for the judgement, and
is to be cast into the bottomless pit, to dwell with
everlasting re.’ This d-id not satisfy Friday; but
he returns upon me, repeating my words, ‘ Reserve
at last! me no understand. But why not kill the
devil now, not kill great ago 2’ ‘ You may as well
ask me,’ said I, ‘ why God does not kill you and
me, when we do wicked things here that oend
him : we are preserved to repent and be pardoned.’
He muses awhile at this: ‘ Well, well,’ says he,
mighty aectionately, ‘ that well; so you, I, devil,
all wicked, all preserve, repent, God pardon all.’
Here I was run down again by him to the last de-
gree, and it was a testimony to me, how the mere
notions of nature, though they will guide reason-
able creatures to the knowledge of a God, and of a
worship or homage due to the supreme being of
God, as the consequence of our nature ; yet nothing
but divine revelation can form the knowledge of
Jesus Christ, and of a redemption purchased for us,
of a mediator of a new covenant, and of an inter-
clcssor at the footstool of God’s_ throne; I say,
nothing but a revelation from heaven can form
these in the soul ; and that therefore the Gospel of
our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, I mean, the
word of God, and the Spirit of God, promised for
the guide and sanctier of his people, are the ab-
solutely necessary instructors of the souls of men
in the saving knowledge of God, and the means of
salvation.
I therefore diverted the present discourse be-
tween me and my man, rising up hastily, as upon
some sudden occasion of going out; then sending
him for something a great way off, I seriously
prayed to God that he would enable me to instruct
saving] y this poor savage, assisting by his Spirit the
heart of the poor ignorant creature. to receive the
light of the knowledge of God in Christ, reconciling
him to himself, and would guide me to speak so to
him from the word of God, as his conscience might
be convinced, his eyes opened, and his soul saved.
When he came again to me, I entered into a long
discourse with him upon the subject of the redemp-
tion of man, by the Saviour of the world, and of
the doctrine of the Gospel preached from heaven,
viz. of repentance towards God, and faith in our
blessed Lord Jesus. I then explained to him, as
well as I could, why our blessed Redeemer took
not on him the nature of angels, but the seed of
Abraham, and how, for that reason, the fallen an-
gels had no share in the redemption ; that he came
only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel, and
the like.
I had, God knows, more sincerity than know-
ledge, in all the methods I took for this poor crea-
ture’s instruction; and must acknowler.ige what I
believe all that act upon the same principle will
nd, that, in laying things open to him. I really in-
formed and instructed myself in many things that
either I did not know, or had not fully considered
before ; but which occurred naturally to my mind,
upon my searching into them for the information
of this poor savage; and I had more affection in
my inquiry after things upon this occasion, than
ever I felt before; so that whether this poor wild
wretch was the better for me or no, I had great rea-
son to be thankful that ever he came to me: my
grief sat lighter upon me, my habitation grew com-
fortable to me beyond measure; and when I re-
ected, that, in this solitary life, which I had been
conned to, I had not only been moved myself to
look up to heaven, and to seek to the I-Iand that
brought me thither, but was now to be made an in-
strument, under Providence, to save the life, and,
for aught I knew, the soul, of a poor savage, and
bring him to the true knowledge of religion, and of
the Christian doctrine, that he might know Christ
Jesus, ‘ to know whom is life eternal;’ 1 say, when I
reected upon all these things, a secret joy ran
through every part of my soul, and I frequently re-
joiced that ever I was brought to this place, which
I had often thought the most dreadful of all amic-
tions th-at could possibly have befallen me.
In this thankful frame I continued all the re-
mainder of my time; and the conversation which
employed the hours between Friday and me was
such as made the three years, which we lived there
together perfectly and completely happy, if any
such thing as complete happiness can be found in a
sublunary state. The savage was now a good Chris-
tian; a. much better than I: though [ have rea-
son to hope, and bless God for it, that we were
equally pcnitent, and comforted restored penitents.
We had here the word of God to read, and no far-
ther off from his Spirit to instruct, than if we had
been in England.
I always applied myself to reading the Scripture,
and to let him knov. , as well as I could, the meaning
of what I read; and he again, by his serious in-
quiries and questions, made me, as .I said before, a
much better scholar in the Scriptureknowledge
than I should ever have been by my own mere pri-
vate reading. Another thing I cannot refrain from
observing here also, from experience, in this re-
tired part of my life; viz. how infinite and inex-
pressible a blessing it is, that the knowledge of God,
and of the doctrine of salvation by Christ Jesus, is
so plainly laid down in the word of God, so easy to
be received and understood, that as the bare read-
ing the Scripture made me capable of understand-
ing enough of my duty to carry me directly on to
the great work of sincere repentance for my sins,
and laying hold of a Saviour for life and salvation,
to a stated, reformation in practice, and obedience
to all God’s commands, and this without any
teacher or instructor (I mean human); so the same
plain instruction suiciently served to the enlight-
ening this savage creature, and bringing him to be
such a Christian, as 1 have known few equal to him
in my life.
As to the disputes, wranglings, strife, and con-
tention, which has happened in the world about re-
ligion, whether niceties in doctrines, or schemes of
church government, they were all perfectly useless
to us, as, for aught I can yet see, they-have been to
all the rest in the world. We had the sure guide
to heaven, viz. the word of God; and we had,
blessed be God! comfortable views of the Spirit of
God, teaching and instructing us by his word, lead-
ing us into all truth, and making us both willing
and obedient to the instruction of his word; and I
cannot see. the least use that the greatest knowledge
of the disputed points in religion. which have made
such confusions in the world, would have been to
us. if we could have obtained it. But I must go
on with the historical part of things, and take every
part in its order.
After Friday and I became more intimately ac-
quainted. and that he could understand almost all
1 said to him, and speak uently, though in broken
English, to me, I acquainted him with my own story,
or at leastso much of it as related to my coming
into the place, how I had lived there, and how long.
I let him into the mystery (for such it was to him)
of gunpowder and bullet, and taught him how to
shoot. I gave him a knife, which he was wonder-
fully delighted with, and I made him a belt with a
frog hanging to it, such as in England we wear
hangers in; and, in the frog, instead of a hanger,
I give him a hatchet, which was not only as good
a weapon in some cases, but much more useful upon
many occasions.
p I described to him the countries of Europe, and
particularly England, which I came from; how we
lived, how we worshipped God, show we behaved to
one another, and how we traded in ships to all
parts of the world. I gave him an account of the
wreck which I had been on board of, and showed
him, as near as I could, the place where she lay;
but she was all beaten in pieces long before, and
quite gone.
I showed him the ruins of our boat, which we
lost when I escaped, and which I could not stir
with my whole strength then, but was now fallen
almost all to pieces. Upon seeing this boat, Friday
stood musing a greatwhile, and said nothing. I
asked him what it was he studied upon; at last,
says he, ‘ Me see such boat like come to place at
my nation.’
I did not understand him a good while; but, at
last, when I had examined further into it, I under-
stood by him, that a boat, such as that had been,
came on shore upon the country where he lived;
that is, as he explained it, was driven thither by
stress of weather. I presently imagined, that some
European ship must have been cast away upon
their coast, and the boat might get loose, and drive
ashore ; but was so dull that I never once thought
of men making escape from a wreck thither, much
less whence they might come; so I only inquired
after a-description of the boat. r
Friday described the boat to me well enough; but
brought me better to understand him, when he added,
with some warmth, ‘ We save the white mans from
drown.’ Then 1 presently asked him, if there were
any white mans, as he called them, in the boat:
‘ Yes,‘ he said, ‘ the boat full of white mans.’ I
asked him, ‘ I-{ow many ?’ He told upon his ngers
seventeen. I asked him then, ‘ What became of
them?’ He told me, ‘ They live, they dwell at my
nation.’
This put new thoughts into my head again; for
I presently imagined, that these might be the men
belonging to the ship that was cast away in sight
of my island, as I now call it; and who, after the
ship was struck on the rock, and they saw her in-
evitably lost, had saved themselves in their boat,
and were landed upon that wild shore, among the
savages.
Upon this, I inquired of him more critically, what
was become of them: he assured me they lived still
there; that they had been there about four years;
that the savages let them alone, and gave them vic-
tuals to live. I asked him, how it came to pass
they did not kill them, and eat them. I-Ie said,
‘ No, they make brother with thcm;’ that is, as I
understood him, a truce : and then he added, ‘They
no eat mans, but when make the war ght ;‘ that is
to say, they never eat any men, but such as come to
ght with them, and are takenin battle.
It was after this, some considerable time, that
being on the top of the hill, at the east side of the
island, from whence, as I have said, I had, in a
clear day, discovered the main or continent of
America; Friday, the weather being very serene,
looks very earnestly towards the main land, and, in
a kind of surprise, falls ajumping and dancing, and
calls out to me, for I was at some distance from
him: I asked him what was the matter. ‘ 0 joy!’
says he, ‘ O glad! There see my country! there
my nation l’
I observed an extraordinary sense of pleasure ap-
peared in his face, and his eyes sparkled, and his
countenance discovered a strange eagerness, as if
he had a mind to be in his own country again; and
this observation ofmine put a great many thoughts
into me, which made me at first not so easy about
my new man Friday, as l was before; and 1 made
no doubt, but that if Friday could get back to his
own nation again, he would not only forget all his
religion, but all his obligation to me; and would be
forward enough to give his countrymen an account
of me, and come back, perhaps, with a hundred or
two of them, and make a feast upon me, at which he
might be as merry as he used to be with those of his
enemies, when they were taken in war.
But I wronged the poor honest creature very
much, for which I was very sorry afterwards: how-
ever, as my jealousy increased, and held mo some
weeks, I was a little more circumspect, and not so
familiar and kind to him as before; in which I was
certainly in the wrong too, the honest, grateful
creature having no thought about it, but what con-
sisted of the best principles,both as a religious Chris-
tian, and as a grateful friend, as appeared afterwards
to my full satisfaction.
Whilst my jealousy of him lasted, you may be
sure I was every day pumping him to see if he
would discover any of the new thoughts, which I
suspected were in him ; but 1 found every thing he
said was honest, and so innocent, that I could nd
nothing to nourish my suspicion; and, in spite of
all my uneasiness, he made me at last entirely his
own again ; nor did he in the least perceive, that I
was uneasy; and therefore 1 could not suspect him
of deceit.
One day, walking up the same hill, but the wea-
ther being hazy at sea, so that we could not see the
continent, I called to him, and said, ‘ I.-‘riday, do not
you wish yourself in your own country, your own
nation?’ ‘ Yes,’ he said, ‘ I be much O glad to be
at my'own nation.’ ‘ What would you do there ?’
said I: ‘ would you turn wild again, eat man's
esh again, and be a savage as you were-before?’
I'Ie looked full of concern, and shaking his head,
said, ‘ No, no; Friday tell them to live good, tell
them to pray God, tell them to eat corn-bread,
cattle-esh, milk: no cat man again.’ ‘ Why then,’
said I to him, ‘ they will kill you.’ He looked grave
at that, and then said, ‘ No, they no kill me; they
willing love learn.’ He meant by this, they would
be willing to learn: he added, they learned much of
the bearded mans that came in the boat. Then I
asked him, if he would go back to them. I-Ie smiled
at that, and told me he could not swim so far. I
told him I would make a canoe for him. I-Ie told
me he would go, if I would go with him. ‘ I go !’
said I, ‘ why they will eat me, if I come the. ~_,’
‘ No, no,’ says he, ‘ me make them no eat you: me
make they much love you.’ He meant he would
tell them how I had killed his enemies, and saved
his life, and so he would make them love me.
Then he told me, as well as he could, how kind
they were to seventeen white men, or bearded men,
as he called them, who came on shore there in
distress.
From this time, I confess, I had a mind to ven-
ture over, and see if I could possibly join with these
bearded men, who, I made no doubt, were Spa-
niards or Portuguese; not doubting but, if I could,
we might nd some method to escape from thence,
being upon the continent, and a good company
together, better than I could from an island, forty
miles off the shore, and alone without help. So,
after some days, I took Friday to work again, by
way of discourse; and told him, I would give him a
boat to go back to his own nation: and accordingly
I carried him to my frigate, which lay on the other
side of the island;.and having cleared it of water
(for I always kept it sunk in the water) I brought
it out, showed it him, and we both went into it.
I found he was a most dexterous’ Fellow at manag-
ing it, would make it go almost as swift and fast
again as I could; so when he was in, I said to him,
‘ Well, now, Friday, shall we go to your nation 2’
He looked very, dull at my saying so, which, it
seems, was because he thought the boat too small
to go s'o far. I told him: then I had a bigger; so
the next day, I went tothe place where the rst
boat lay which I had made, but which I could not
get into the water, I-Ie said that was big enough ;
but then, ais I had taken no care of it, and it had
lain two or three-and~twenty yea-rs there, the sun
had split and dried it, that it was in a manner rot-
ten. Friday told" me that such a boat would do very
well, and would carry ‘ much enough vittle-, drink,
bread ;’ that was his way of talking.
Upon the whole, I was by this time so xed upon
my design of going over with him to the continent,
that I told him we would go and make one as big
as that, and he should go home in it. He an-
swered not one word, but looked very grave and
sad. I asked him what was the matter with him.
He asked me again thus, ‘ Why you angry mad
with Friday? What me done?’ I asked him what
he meant: I told him I was not angry with him at
all. ‘ No angry ! no angry !’ says he, repeating the
words several times : ‘ why send Friday home away
to my nation 2’ ‘ Why,’ said I, ‘ Friday did you not
say you wished you were there ?’ ‘ Yes, yes,’ says
he, ‘ wish be both there; no wish Friday there; no
master there.’ In a word, he would not think of
going there without me. ‘ I go there, Friday !’ said
I: ‘ what should I do there?’ He turned very
quick upon me at this: ‘ You do great deal much
good,’ says he; ‘ you teach wild mans be good,
sober, tame mans: you tell them know God, pray
God, and live new life.’ ‘Alas, Friday,’ said I,
‘ thou knowest not what thou sayest: I am but an
ignorant man myself.’ ‘ Yes, yes,’ says he, ‘ you
teachee me good, you teachee them good.’ ‘ No, no,
Friday,’ said I, ‘ you shall go without me: lea{'e
me here to live by myself, as I did before. He
looked confused again at that word; and, running to
one of the hatchets which he used to wear, he
takes it up hastily, and gives it me. ‘ What must I
do with this?’ said" Ito him. ‘ You take kill Fri~
day,’ says he. ‘ Wliat must I kill you for?’ said I
again. He returns very quick, ‘ What you send
Friday away for? Take kill Friday: no send Friday
away.’ This he spoke so earnestly, that I saw tears
stand in his eyes. In a word, I so plainly disc0~
vered the utmost affection in him to me, and a rm
resolution in him, that I told him then, and often
after, that I would never send him away from me,
if he was willing to stay with mo. ‘
Upon the whole, as I found, by all his discourse,
a settled affection to me, and that nothingishould
part him from me, so I found all the foundation of
his desire to go to his own country was laid in his
ardent affection to the people, and his hopes of my
doing them good; a thing, which as I had no no-
tion of myself, so I had not the least thought, or
intention, or desire of undertaking it. But still I
found a strong inclination to my attempting an
escape, as above, founded on the supposition gather~
ed from the f0l‘lT1&i‘ discourse; viz. that there were
seventeen bearded men there‘; and therefore,witho-.1L
any more delay, I went to'work with Friday, to find
out a great tree proper to fell, and make a large pe-
riagua, or canoe,‘ to undertake the voyage. There
were trees enough in the island to have built a
little eet, not of periaguas and canoes only, but
even of good large vessels; but the main thing I
looked at, was to get one so near the water, that we
might launch it when it was made, to avoid the mis-
take I committed at rst.
At last Friday pitched upon a tree; for I found
he knew much better than I what kind of wood was
ttest for it; nor can I tell, to.this day, what wood
to call the tree we cut down, except that it was
. M
very like the tree we call fustic, or between that
and the~Nicaragua wood, for it was much ~of -the
same colour and smell. Fridaywas for burning the
hollow or cavity of this tree out, to make -it into a
boat: but I showed him how rather to cut it out
with tools, which after I showed him how to use,
he did it very handily; and, in about a month's
hard labour, we nished it, and made it very hand-
some, especially when with our axes, which I showed
him how to handle, we cut and hewed the outside
into the true shape of a boat. After this, however,
it cost us near a fortnight’s time to get her along,
as it were, inch -by inch, upon great rollers, into the
‘water zibut when she was in, she would have car-
ried" twenty men with great ease. I
When she was in the~water,-and though she was
so big, it amazed me to see with what dexterity and
how swift my man Friday would manage her, turn
her, and paddle her along. So I asked him if he
would, and if we might, venture over in her ; ‘ Yes,’
he said, ‘ me venture over in her very well, though
great blow wind.’ However, I had a farther design
that he knew nothing of, and that was to make a
mast and a sail, and to.,f1t her with an anchor and
cable. As to a mast, that was easy enough to get ;
so I pitched upon a straight young cedar-tree, which
I found near the place, and which there was great
plenty of in the island; and I set Friday to_work to
cut it down, and gave him directions how to shape
and order it: but as to the sail, that was my par-
ticular care. I knew I had old sails, or rather pieces
of old sails enough, but as I had had them now twen-
ty-six years by me, and had not been very careful to
preserve them, not imagining that I should ever
have this kind of use for them, I did not doubt but
they were all rotten; and indeed most of them
were so. However, I found two pieces which ap-
peared pretty good, and with these I went to work;
and with a great deal of pains, and awkward tedious
stitching (you may be sure), for want of needles, I
1
at length made a three-cornered ugly thing, like
what We call in England a shoulder-of-xnutton sail,
to go with a boom at-bottom, and a little short sprit
at the top, such as usually our ships’ long-boats sail
with, and such as I best knew how to manage, be-
cause it‘ was such a one as I used in the boat in
which I made my escape from Barbary, as related in
the rst part of my story. "
_ I was near two months performing this last work;
viz. rigging and tting my mast and sails; for I
nished them very complete, making a small stay,
and a sail or foresail to it, to assist, if we should
turn to windward; and, which was more than all,
I xed a rudder to the stern of her, to steer with:
and though I was but_a bungling shipwright, yet as
I knew the usefulness and even necessity of such a
thing, I applied myself with so much pains to do it,
that at last’l brought it to pass; though, considering
the many dull contrivances I had for it that failed,
I think it cost me almost as much labour as making
the boat. '
After all this was done, I had my man Friday to
teach as to what belonged to the navigation of my
boat; for though he knew very well how to paddle
the canoe, he knew nothing what belonged to a sail
and a rudder, and was the most amazed when he
saw me work the boat to-and-again in the sea, by
the rudder, and how the sail gibbed, and lled this
way or that way, as the course we sailed changed;
I say, when he saw this, he stood like one asto-
nished and amazed. However, with a little use, I
made all these things familiar to him, and he became-
an expert sailor, except that as to the compass, I
could make him understand very little of that: on
the other hand, as there was very little cloudy wea~
ther, and seldom or never any fogs in those parts,
there was the less occasion for a compass, seeing
the stars were always to be seen by night, and the
shore by day, except in the rainy seasons ; and then
nobody cared to stir abroad, either by land or sea. .
I was now entered on the seven-and-twentieth
year of my captivity in this place; though the three
last years that I had this creature with me ought
rather to be left out of the account, my habitation
being quite of another kind, than in all the rest of
the time. I kept the anniversary of my landing
here, with the same thankfulness to God for his
mercies as at_rst; and if I had such cause of'ac-
knowledgement at rst, I had much more so now,
having such additional testimonies of the care of
Providence over me, and the great hopes I had of
being effectually and speedily delivered: for I had
an invincible impression upon my thoughts, that
my deliverance was at hand, and that I should not
be another year in this place. However, I went on
with my husbandry, digging, planting, fencing, as
usual; I gathered and cured my grapes, and did
every necessary thing, as before. '
The rainy season was in the mean time upon me,
when I kept more within doors than at other times ;
so I had stowed our new vessel as secure as we
could,‘ bringing her up into the creek, where, as I
said in the beginning, I landed my rafts from the
ship: and hauling her up to the shore, at high-
water mark, I made my man Friday dig a little
dock, just big enough to hold her, and just deep
enough to give her water enough to oat in ; and
then when the tide was out, we made a strong dam
cross the end of it, to keep the water out; and so
she lay dry, as to the tide from the sea; and to
keep the rain off, we laid a great many boughs of
trees so thick, that she was as well thatched as a
house: and thus we waited for the months of No-
vember and December, in which I designed to make
my adventure.
When the settled season began to come in, as the
thought of my design returned with the fair wea~
ther, I was preparing daily for the voyage; and the
rst thing I did was to lay by a certain quantity of
provisions, being the stores for our voyage; and in-
*3
\P~
(.1
tended, in a week or a fortnight’s time, to open the
dock, and launch out our boat. I was busy one
morning upon something of this kind, when I called
to Friday, and bade him go to the sea-shore, and
see [if he" could nd a turtle, or tortoise, a thing
which we generally got once a week, for the sake of
the eggs, as well as the flesh. Friday had not been
long gone, when he came running back, and ew
over my outward wall, or fence, like one that felt
not the ground, or the steps he set his feet on ; and
before I had time to speak to him, he cried out to
me, ‘ 0 master! 0 master! O sorrow! O bad !’
‘ What's the matter, Friday?’ said I. ‘ O yonder
there,’ says he, ‘ one, two, three canoe! one, two,
three l’ By this way of speaking, I concluded there
were six ; but, on inquiry, I found there were but
three. ‘ Well, Friday,’ said I, ‘ do not be frightedz’
so I heartened him up as well as I could. How-
ever, I saw the poor fellow was most terribly scared;
for nothing ran in his head but that they were
come to look for him, and would cut him in pieces,
and eat him; and the poor fellow trembled so, that
I scarce knew what to do with him. I comforted
him as well as 1 could, and told him I was in as‘
much danger as he, and that they would cat me as
well as him. ‘ But,’ said I, ‘ Friday, we must re-
solve to ght them. Can yon ght, Friday ?' ‘ Me
shoot,’ says lie; ‘ but there come many great num-
ber.’ ‘ No matter for that,’ said I again, ‘ our guns
will fright them that we do not kill.’ So I asked
him, whether, if I resolved to defend him, he would
defend me, and stand by me, and do just as I bade
him. He said, ‘ Me die, when you bid die, master.’
Soil went and fetched a good dram of rum, and
gave him ; for I had been so good a husband of my
rum, that I had a great deal left. When he had
drank it, I made him take the two fowling-pieces,
which we always carried, and load them with large
swan-shot. as big as small pistol-bullets: then I tool:
four muskets, and loaded them with ‘two slugs, and
ve small bullets each; and my two pistols I loaded
with a brace of bullets each. I hung my great
sword, as usual, naked by my side, and gave Friday
his hatchet. .
' When I had thus prepared myself, I took my per-'
spective glass, and went up to the side of the hill,
to see what I could discover; and I found quickly,
by my glass, that there were one-and-twenty savages,
three prisoners, and three canoes; and that their
whole business seemed to be the triumphant ban-
quet upon these three humanbodies (a barbarous
feast indeed l) ; hut nothing more than as I had ob-
served-was usual with them.
- I observed also, that they were landed, not where
they had done when Friday made his escape, but
nearer to my creek, where the shore was low, and
where a thick wood came close almost down to the
sea. This, with the abhorrence of the inhuman
errand these wretehes came about, so lled me with
indignation, that I came down again to Friday, and
told him I was resolved to go down to them, and
kill them all; and asked him if he would stand by
me. Isle had -new gotten over his fright, and his
spirits being a little raised with the dram I had given
him, he was very cheerful; and told me, as before,
‘ he would die,.when I bid die.’ l ' I »_
In this t of fury, Itook rst and divided the
arms which I had charged, as before, between us:
I gave Friday one pistol to stick in his girdle, and
three guns upon his shoulder; and I took one pis-
tol, and the other three myself; and in this posture
we marched out. I took as small bottle of rum in
my pocket, and gave Friday a large bag with more
powder and bullet ; and as to orders, I charged him
to -keep close behind me, and not to stir, or shoot,
or do any thing till I bade him; and, in the mean
time, not to speak a word. In this posture I fetched
a compass to my right hand of near a mile, as well
to get over the creek as to get into the wood; so
that I might come within shot of them, before I
should be discovered, which I had seen by my glass
it was easy to do.
While I was making this march, my former thoughts
returning, I began to abate my resolution. I do not
mean that I entertained any fear of their number:
for as they were naked, unarmed wretches, it is cer-
tain I was superior to them; nay, though Iliad been
alone: but it occurred to my thoughts, what call,
what occasion, much less what necessity I was in
to go and dip my hands in blood, to attack people
who had neither done nor intended me any wrong;
who, as to me, were innocent, and whose barbarous
customs were their own disaster, being in them a
token indeed of God’s having left them, with the
other nations of that part of the world, to such stu~
‘pidity, and to such inhuman courses; but did not
call me to take upon me to be a judge of their ac-
tions, much less an executioner of his justice: that
whenever he thought t, he would take the cause
into his own hands, and, by national vengeance,
punish them fornational crimes; but that in the mean
time, it was none of my business : that it was true,
Friday might justify it, because he was a declared
enemy, and in a state of war with those very par-
ticular people, and it "was lawful for him to attack
them; but I could not say the same with respect
to me. These things were so warmly pressed upon
my thoughts all the way as I went, thatl resolved I
would only go and place myself near them, that I
might observe their barbarous feast, and thatl would
act then as God should direct; but that, unless some-
thing oifered that was more a call to me than yet I
knew of, I would not meddle with them. r
With this resolution I entered the wood, and with
all possible wariness and silence (Friday following
close at my heels), I marched till I came to the
skirt of the wood, on the side which was next to
them; only that one corner -of the wood lay be-
tween me and them. I-Iere I called softly to l-‘ri-t
day, andshowing him a great tree, which was just-
Y
at the corner of the wood, I bade him go to the tree,
and bring me word if he could see there plainly
what they were doing. He did so, and came im~
piediately back to me, and told me they might be
plainly viewed there; that they were all about the
re, eating the esh of one of their prisoners; and
that another lay bound upon the sand, a little from
them, whom, he said, they would kill next, and
which fired the very soul within me. He told me it
was not one of their nation, but one of the bearded
men whom he had told me of, that came to their
country‘ in the boat. I was lled with horror at
the very naming the white, bearded man; and, going
to the tree, I saw plainly, by my glass, a white
man, who lay upon the beach of the sea, with his
hands and his feet tied with flags, or things like
rushes; and that he was an European, and had
clothes on.
There was another tree, and a little thicket be-
yond it, about fty yards nearer to them than the
place where I was, which, by going a, little way
about, I saw I might come at undiscovered, and
that then I should be within half shot of them. So
I withheld my passion, though I was indeed enraged
to the highest degree; and,_going back about twenty
paces, I got behind some bushes, which held all the
way till I came to the other tree, and then I came
to a little rising ground, which gave me a full view
of them, at the distance of about eighty yards.
I hadnow not a moment to lose; for nineteen of
the dreadful wretehes sat upon the ground, all close
huddled together, and had just sent the other two to
butcher the poor Christian, and bring him, perhaps,
limb by limb, to their re; and they were stooped
down to untie the bands at his feet. I turned to Fri-
day: ‘Now, Friday,’said'I,‘do as I bid thee.’ Friday
said he would. ‘ Then, 1-‘riday,’_said I, ‘ do exactly
as you see me do; fail iirnotliing.’ So I set down
one of the mnskcts, and the fowling-piece, upon the
ground, and Friday did the like by his; and with
\
the other musket I took my aim at the savages, bid-
ding him to do the like: then asking him if he was
ready, he said, ‘ Yes.’ ‘ Then lire at them,’ said I ;
and the same moment I red also. i
. Friday took his aim so much better than I, that, on
the side that he shot, he killed two of them, and
wounded three more ; and, on my side, I killed
one, and wounded two. They were, you may be
sure, in a dreadl’u‘. consternation; and all of them,
who were not hurt, jumped up upon their feet im-
mediately, but did not know which way to run, or
which way to look ; for they knew not from whence
their destruction came. I-‘riday kept his eyes close
upon me, that, as I had bid him, he might observe
what I did: so, as soon as the rst shot was made,
I threw down the piece, and took up the fowling-
piece, and Friday did the like : he sees me cock and
present; he did the same again. ‘ Are you ready,
I-‘riday?’ said I. ‘ Yes,’ said he. ‘ Let y, then,’
said I, ‘ in the name of God ;’ and with that I red
again among the amazed wretches, and so did Fri-
day ; and as our pieceswere now loaden with what
1 called swan-shot, or small pistol bullets, we found
only two drop; but so many were wounded, that
they ran about yelling and screaming like mad crea-
tures, all bloody and miserably wounded, most of
them ; whereof three more fell quickly after, though
not quite dead. ' .
‘ Now, Friday,’ said I, laying down the discharged
pieces, and taking up the musket, which was yet
loaden, ‘follow me,’ said I; which he did, with a
deal of courage; upon which I rushed out of the
wood, and showed myself, and Friday close at my
foot. As soon as I perceived they saw me, I shouted
as loud as I could, and bade Friday do so too;
and running as fast as I could, which, by the way,
was not very fast, being loaded with arms as I was,
I made directly towards the poor victim, who was,
as I said, lying upon the beach or shore, between the
place where they sat, and the sea. The two butchers‘,
M 2
who were just going to work with him, had left
him, at the surprise of our rst re, and lied, in a
terrible fright, to the sea-side, and had jumped into a
canoe, and three. more of the rest made the same
way. I turned to Friday, and bade him step for-
wards, and fire at them: he understood me imme-
diately, and, running about forty yards to be near
tbem, he shot atthem, and I thought he had killed
‘them all; forI saw them all fall on at heap in the
boat; though I saw two of them up again quickly:
however, he killed two of them, and wounded the
third, so that he lay down in the bottom of the
boat, as if he had been dead.
While my man Friday red at them, I pulled out
my knife, and cut the ags that bound the poor vic-
tim; and, loosing; his hands and feet, I lifted him
up, and asked him, in the Portuguese tongue, what
he was. He answered, in Latin, ‘ Christianus ;’ but
was so weak and faint, that he could scarce stand,
ior speak.' I took my bottle out of my pocket, and
gave it him, making signs that he should drink,
which he did; and I gave him a piece of bread,
which-he eat. Then I asked him what countryman
he was; and he said, ‘ Espagnolc :’ and, being a
littlerecovered, let me know, by all the signs he
couldpossibly make, how much he was in my debt
for his deliverance. ' Seignior,’ said I , with as much
Spanish as I could make up, ‘ we will talk after-
wards, but we must ght now: if you have any
strength left, take this pistol and sword,“and lay
about you.’ He took them very thankfully, and no
sooner had he the arms in his hands, but, as if they
had'put new vigour into him, he ew upon his'mur-
derers, like a fury, and had cut two of them in
pieces in an instant; for the truth is, as the whole
was a surprise to them, so the poor creatures were
so much frighted with the noise of our pieces, that
they fell down for mere amazement and fear, and
had no more power to attempt their own escape,
than their esh had to resist our shot; and that
was the case of those ve that Friday shot at in the
boat; for as three of them fell with the hurt they
received, so the other two fell with the fright.
I kept my piece in my hand still, without ring,
being willing to keep my charge ready, because I had
given the Spaniard my pistol and sword ; so I called
to Friday, and bade him run up to the tree from
whence we rst fired, and fetch the arms which lay
there, that had been discharged, which he did with
great swiftncss; and then giving him my musket, I
sat down myself to load all the rest again, and bade
them come to me when they wanted. "While I was
loading these pieces, there happened a erce en-
gagement between the Spaniard and one of the
savages, who made at him with one of their great
wooden swords, the same weapon that was to have
killed him before, if I had not prevented it. The
Spaniard, who was as bold and as brave as could be
imagined, though weak, had fought this Indian a
good while, and had cut him two great wounds. on
his head : but the savage, being a stout, lusty fellow,
closing in with him, had thrown him down (being
faint), and was wringing my sword out of his hand,
when the Spaniard, though undermost, wisely quit~
ting the sword, drew the pistol from his girdle, shot
the savage through the body, and killed him upon
the spot, before I, who was running to help, could
come near him.
Friday, being now left at his liberty, pursued the
ying wretches with no weapon in his hand but his
hatchet; and with that he dispatched those three
who, as I said before, were wounded at rst and
fallen, and all the rest he could come up with; and
the Spaniard coming to me for a gun, I gave him one
of the fowling-pieces, with which he pursued two of
the savages, and wounded them both ; but as he was
not able to run, they both got from him into, the
wood, where Friday pursued them, and killed one
of them; but the other was too nimble for him;
and though he was wounded, yet had plunged -into

-*1.->T'I11 all. ‘ I
Those that were in the canoe, worked hard to get
out of gun-shot; and though _I"i-iday made two or
three shot at them, I did not nd that he hit any
of them. Friday would fain have had me take one
of their canoes, and pursue them; and indeed I was
very anxious about their escape, lest, carrying the
news home to their people, they should come back,
perhaps, with two or three hundred of their canoes,
and devour us by mere multitude; so I consented
to piu'sue them by sea; and running to one of their
canoes, I jumped in, and bade Friday follow me;
but when I was in the canoe, I was surprised to
nd another -poor creature lie there alive, bound
hand and foot, as the Spaniard was, for the slaughter,
and almost dead with fear, not knowing" what the
matter was, for he had not been able to look up
over the sideof the boat: he was tied so hard, neck
and heels, and had been tied so long, that he had
really little life in him.
. -
Q
L
' I immediately cut the twisted ags, or rushes;
which they had bound him, with, and would have
helped him up; but he could not stand, or speak,
but groaned most piteously, believing, it seems, still
that he was only unbound in order to be killed.
- When Friday came to him, I bade him speak to
him, and tell him of his deliverance; and pulling
out my bottle, made him give the poor wretch a
dram, which, with the news of his being delivered,
revived him, and he sat up in the boat; but when
Friday came to hear him- speak, and looked in his
face, it would have moved any one to tears, to have
seen how Friday kissed him, embraced him, hugged
him, cried, laughed, hal1ooed,jumped about, danced,
sung, then cried again, wrung his hands, beat his
own face and head, and then sung and jumped about
again, like a distracted creature. It was a good
while before I could make him speak to me, or tell
me what was-the matter; but when he came a little
to himself, he told me, that it was his father.
-' It is not easy for me to express how it moved
me, to see what ecstasy and lial-affection had
worked in this poor savage, at the sight of his
father, and of his being delivered from death; nor
indeed can I describe half the extravagances of his
aection after this; for he went into the boat, and
out of the boat, a great many times. When he went
in to him, he would sit down by him, open his
breast, and hold his father’s head close to his bosom,
half an hour together, to nourish it; then he took
his arms and aneles, which were numbed and stiff
withthe binding, and ehafed and rubbed them with
his hands; and I, perceiving what the case was,
gave him some rum out of my bottle to rub them
with, which did them a ‘great deal of good. '
This action put an end to our pursuit of the canoe
with the other savages, who were new gotten almost
out of sight; and it was happy for us that we did
not, for it blew so hard within two hours after, and
before they could be gotten a quarter of their way,
and continued blowing so hard all night, and that
from the north-west, which was against them, that I
could not suppose their boat could live, or that they
ever reached to their own coast.~
But to return to Friday, he was so busy about
his father, that I could not nd in my heart to take
him off, for some time: but after I thought he
could leave him-a little, I called him to me, and he
came jumping and laughing, and pleased to the high-
est extreme. Then I asked him, if he had given his
father any bread. He shook his head, and /said,
‘: None: ugly dog eat all up self.’ So I gave him a
cake of bread out of a little pouch I carried on pur-
pose; I also gave him a dram for himself, but he
would not taste it; but carried it to his father. I
had in my pocket also two or three bunches of my
raisins, so I gave him a handful of them "for his
father. I-Ie had no sooner given his father these
raisins, but I saw. him come out of the boat, and run
away, as if he had beenbewitched. He ran at such
a‘ rate (for he was The swiftest fellow of his foot that
ever I saw), I say, he ran at such a rate, that he was-
out of sight, as it were, -in an instant ; and though I
called and -hallooed too after him, it was all one:
away he went, and, in a quarter of an hour, I saw
him come back again, though not so fast as he went;
and as he came nearer, I found his pace was slacker,
because he had something in his hand. w
. When he came up to me, I found he had. been
quite home for an earthen jug, or pot, to bring his
fatl‘1er_ some fresh water; and that he had got two
more cakes, or loaves of bread. The bread he gave
me, but the water he carried to his father : however,
as I was very thirsty too, I took a little ‘sup of it.
This water revived his father more than all the rum
or spirits I had given him ; for he was just fainting
with thirst. .
1' When his father had drunk, I called to him to
klnow if there was any water left: he said, ‘ Yes ;’
andlbade him give it to the poor Spaniardnvho was
in as much want of it as his father; and I sent one
of the cakes, that Friday brought, to the Spaniard
too, who was indeed very weak, and was reposing
himself upon a green place, under the shade of a
tree, and whose limbs were also very stiff, and very
much swelled with the rude bandage he had been
tied with. When I saw that upon Friday’s com-
ing to him with the water, he sat up, and drank,
and took the bread, and began to eat, I went to
him, and gave him a handful of raisins. He looked
up in my face with all the tokens of gratitude and
thankfulness that could appear in any countenance;
but was so weak, notwithstanding he had so exerted
himself in the ght, that he could not stand up upon
his feet: he tried to do it two or three times, but
was really not able, his ancles were so- swelled, and
so painful to him ; so I bade him sit still, and caused
Friday to rub his ancles, and bathe them with rum,
as he had done his father’s.
I observed the poor afectionate creature every
two minutes, or perhaps less, all the while he was
here, turned his head about, to see if his father was
in the same place and posture as he left him sitting;
and at last he found he was not to be seen, at which
he started up, and, without speaking a word, flew
with that swiftness to him, that one could scarce
perceive his feet to touch the ground as he went:
but when he came, he only found he had laid him-
self down to ease his limbs. So Friday came back to
me presently; and I then spoke to the Spaniard to
let Friday help him up, if he could, and lead him
to the boat, and then he should carry him to our
dwelling, where I would take care of him: but
Friday, a lusty young fellow, took the Spaniard
quite up upon his back, and carried him away to the
boat, and set him down softly upon the side or gun-
nel of the canoe, with his feet in the inside of it,
and then lifted him quite in, and set him close to his
father, and presently stepping out again launched
the boat off, and paddled it.al0ng the shore faster
than I could walk,*though the wind blew pretty
hard too ; so he brought them both safe -into. our
creek, and leaving them in the boat, runs away to
fetch the other canoe. As he passed me, Ispoke
to him, and asked him whither he went. He told
me, ‘ Go fetch more boat.’ So away he went, like
the wind; for sure never man or horse ran like him,
and he had the other canoe in the creek, almost as
soon as I got to it by land : so he wafted me over;
and then went to help our new guests out of the
boat,‘which he did; but they were neither of them able
to walk; so that poor Friday knew not what to do.
.To remedy this, I went to work in my thought,
and calling to Friday to bid them sit down on the
bank while he came to me, I soon made a kind of
hand-barrow to lay them on, and Friday and I car-
ried them up both together upon it between us.
But when we got them to the outside of our wall,
or fortication, we were at a worse loss than before,
for it was impossible to get them over; and I was
resolved not to break it down. So I set to work
again ; and Friday and I, in about two hours’ time,
made a very handsome tent, covered with old sails-,
and above that with boughs of trees, being in- the
space without our outward fence, and between that
and the grove of young wood which I had planted:
and here we made them two beds of such things as I
had;.viz. of g00d rice straw, with blankets laid
upon it to lie on, and another to cover them on
each bed. ' -
i- My island was now peopled, and I thought my-
self very rich in subjects; and it was a merry reec-
tion which I frequently made, how like a king I
looked. First of all, the whole country was my own
mere property, so that I had an undoubted right of
dominion. Secondly, my people were perfectly sub-
jected: I was the absolute lord and lawgiver: they
all owed their lives to me, and were ready to lay
down their lives, if there had been occasion of
it, for me. it was remarkable too, I had but three
. _\ p _
subjects, and they were of three different religions:
my man Friday was a protestant; his father was a
pagan and a cannibal; and theSpaniard was a papist.
However, I allowed liberty of conscience throughout
my dominions. But this is by the way.
" As soon as I had secured my two weak, rescued
prisoners, and given them shelter, and a place to
rest them upon, I began to think of making some
provision for them : and the rst thing I did, I or-
dered Friday to take a yearling goat, betwixt a kid
and a goat, out of my particular ock, to be killed.
Then I cut off the hinder quarter, and chopping it
into small pieces, I set Friday to work to boiling and
stewing, and made them a very good dish, I assure
you, of esh and broth, having put some barley and
rice also into the broth; and as I cooked it without
doors, for I made no re within my inner wall, so I
carried it all into the new tent: and having set a.
table there for them, I sat down and eat my dinner
also with them; and, as well as I could, cheered
them and encouraged them, Friday being my inter-
preter, especially to his father, and indeed to the
Spaniard too; for the Spaniard spoke the language
of the savages pretty well.
‘ After we had dined, or rather supped, I ordered
Friday to take one of the canoes, and go and fetch
our muskets and other re-arms, which, for want of
time, we had left upon the place of battle; and the
next day I ordered him to go and bury the dead.
bodies of the‘ savages, which lay open to the sun,
and would presently be offensive; and I also or-
dered him to bury the horrid remains of their ban-
barous feast, which I knew were pretty much, and
which I could not think of doing myself; nay, I
could not bear to see them, if I went that way. All
which he punctuall y performed, and defaced the very
appearance of the savages being there; so that when
1 went again, I could scarce know where it was,
otherwise than by the corner of the wood, pointing
r.o'thc place. . '
£58 ROBINSON CRUSOE.
- I then began to enter into a little conversation
with my two new subjects; and rst I set Friday to
inquire of his father what he thought of the escape of
the savages in that canoe, and whether we might
expect a return of them with a power too great for
us to resist. I-Iis rst opinion was, that the savages
in the boat never could live out the storm which
blew that night they wont off, but must of neces-
sity be drowned or driven south to those other
shores, where they were as sure to be devoured as
they were to be drowned, if they were cast away:
but as to what they would do, if they came safe on
shore, he said, he knew not; but it was his opinion
that they were so dreadfully frightcd with the manner
of their being attacked, the noise, and the re, that
he believed they would tell their people they were
all killed by thunder and lightning, and not by the
hand of man; and that the two which appeared
(viz. 1-‘riday and I) were two -heavenly spirits or
furies come down to destroy them, and not men with
weapons. This, he said, he knew, because ho heard
them all cry out so in their language to one an-
other; for it was impossible to them to conceive that
a man could dart re, and speak thunder, and kill
at a distance, without lifting up the hand, as was
done now. And this old savage was in the right;
for, as I understood since by .other hands, the sa-
vages of that part never attempted to go over to the
island al’te1‘wards. They were so terried with the
accounts given by those four men (for it seems they
did escape the sea), that they believed, whoever
wont to that enchanted island, would be destroyed
with re from the gods.
This, however, I knew not, and therefore was un-
der continual apprehensions for a good while, and
kept always upon my guard, I and all my army; for
as we were now four of us, I would have ventured
upon a hundred of them fairly, in the open eld, at
any time. ' ,
In a little time, however, no more canoes appear-;
I
ing, the fear of their coming wore o‘, and I began
to take my former thoughts of a voyage to the main
into consideration, being likewise assured by Fri-
day’s father, that I might depend upon good usage
from their nation, on his account, if I would go.
But my thoughts were a little suspended, when I
had a serious discourse with the Spaniard, and when
I understood that there were sixteen more of his
countrymen and Portuguese, who having been cast
away, and made their escape to that side, lived
there at peace indeed with the savages, but were
very sore put to it for necessaries, and indeed for
life. I asked him all the particulars of their voy-
age, and found they were a Spanish ship, bound
from the Rio dc la Plata, to the Havanna, being di-
rected to leave their loading there, which was chiefly
hides and silver, and to bring back what European
goods they could meet with ‘there; that they had
ve Portuguese seamen on board, whom they took
out of another wreck; that ve of their own men
were drowned when rst the ship was lost; and
that these escaped through infinite dangers and ha-
zands, and arrived almost starved on the cannibal
coast, where they expected to have been devoured
every moment.
He told me, they had some arms with them, but
they were perfectly useless, for that they had nei-
ther powdcr nor ball, the washing of the sea having
spoiled all their powder, but a little which they used
at their rst landing to provide themselves some
food. r "
I asked him what he thought would become of
them there ; and if they had formed no design of
making any escape. I-Ie said, they had many con~
sultations about it; but that having neither ves~
sel, nor tools to build one, nor provisions of any
kind, their counsels always ended in tears and
despair. ‘-
. I asked him how he thought they would receive
aproposal from me, which might tend towards an
escape ; and whether, if they were all here,'it might
not be done. I told him, with freedom, I feared
mostly their treachery and ill usage of me, if I put
my life into their hands; for that gratitude was'no
inherent virtue in the nature of man; nor did men
always square their dealings by the obligations they
had received, so much as they did by the advan-
tages they expected. I told him it would be very
hard, that .1 should be the instrument of s their de-
liverance, and that they should afterwards make me
their prisoner in New Spain, where an Englishman
was certain to be made a sacrice, what necessity,
or- what accident soever, brought him thither: and
that I had rather be delivered up to the savages,
and bedevoured alive, than fall into the merciless
claws of the priests, and becarried into the Inqui-
sition. I added, that otherwise I was persuaded, if
they were all here, we might, with so many hands,
build a bark large enough to carry us all away,
either to the Brasi-ls, southward, or to the islands,
or Spanish coast, northward: but tliat if, in requital,
they should, when I had put weapons into their
hands, carry me, by force, among their own people,
Imight be -ill used for my kindness to them, and
make my case worse than it was before. '
~H,e answered with a great deal of candour and
ingenuity, that their condition was so miserable,
and they were so sensible of it, that he believed
they would abhor the thought of using any man
unkindly, that should contribute to their deliver-
ance; and that, if I pleased, he would go to them
with the old man, and discourse with them about it,
and return again, and bring me their answer: that
he would make conditions with them, upon their
solemn oath, that they should be absolutely under
my leading, as their commander and captain; and
that they should swear upon the holy sacraments
and the Gospel, to be true to me, and to go to such
Christian country as I should agree to, and no
other; and to be directed wholly and absolutely"
by my orders, till they were landed safely in such
country as I intended; and that he would bring
a contract from them, under their hands, for that
purpose.
Then he told me, he would rst swear to me
himself, that he would never stir from me as long
as he lived, till I gave him orders; and that he
would take my side to the last drop of blood, if
there should happen the least breach of faith among
his countrymen.
He told me they were all of them very civil,
honest men, and they were under the greatest dis-
tress imaginable, having neither weapons nor clothes,
nor any food, but at the mercy and discretion of
the savages, out of all hopes of ever returning to
their own country; and that he was sure, if I
would undertake their relief, they would live and
die by me.
Uponrthese assurances, I resolved to venture to
relieve them, if possible, and to send the old savage
and this Spaniard over to them to treat. But when
he had gotten all things in readiness to go, the Spa-
niard himself started an objection, which had so
much prudence in it on one hand, and so much
sincerity on the other hand, that I could not but
be very well satised in it; and, by his advice, put
off the deliverance of his comrades for at least half
a year. The case was thus :
He had been with us now about a month, during
which time I had let him see in what manner I had
provided, with the assistance of Providence, for my
support; and he saw evidently what stock of corn
and rice I had laid up, which, as it was more than
sutlicient for myself, so it was not suliicicnt, at least,
without good husbandry, for my family, now it was
increased to number four: but much less would it
be suicient, if his countrymen, who were, as he
said, fourteen, still alive, should come over; and,
least of all, would it be sufcient to victual our ves-
sel, if we should build one, for a voyage to any of
the Christian colonies of America. So he told me,
hecthought it would be more advisable to let him,
and the two other, dig and cultivate some more
land, as much as I could spare seed to sow; and
that we should wait another harvest, that we might
have a supply of corn for his countrymen, when
they should come; for want might be a temptation
to them to disagree, or not to think themselves de-
livered, otherwise than out of one diiculty into
another. ‘ You know,’ says he, ‘ the children of
Israel, though they rejoiced at rst at their being
delivered out of Egypt, yet rebelled even against
God himself, that delivered them, when they ‘came
to want bread in the wilderness.’
His caution was so seasonable, and his advice so
good, that I could not but be very well pleased
with his proposal, as well as I was satised with
his delity. So we fell to digging all four of
us, as well as the wooden tools we were furnished
with permitted; and in about a month's time, by
the end of which it was seed-time. we had gotten
as much land cured and trimmed up as we sowed
twenty-two bushels of barley on, and siiteen jars of
rice, which was, in short, all the seed we had to
spare; nor indeed did we leave ourselves barley
suicient for our own food, for the six months" that
we had to expect our crop, that is to say, reckoning
from the time we set our seed aside for sowing ; for
it is not to be supposed it is six months in the
ground in that country.
Having now society enough, and our number
being sufeient to put us out of fear of the savages,
if they had come, unless their number had been
very great, we went freely all over the island, where-
ever .we found occasion; and as here we had our
escape or deliverance upon our thoughts, itiwas im-
possible, at least for me, to have the means of it
out of mine. To this purpose, I marked out several
trees, which I thought t, for our work, and I set
Friday and his father to cutting them down; and
then I caused the Spaniard, to whom I imparted my
thoughts on that affair, to oversee and direct their
work. I showed them with what indefatigable pains
I had hewed a large-tree into single planks, and I
caused them to do the like, till they had made about
a dozen large planks of good oak, near two feet
broad, thirty-ve feet long, and from two inches to
four inches thick. What prodigious labour it took
up; any one may imagine. -
At the same time, I contrived to increase my little
ock of tame goats as much as I could; and to this
purpose I made Friday and the Spaniard go out one
day, and myself with Friday the next day; for we
took our turns: and, by this means, we got about
twentyyoung kids to breed up with the rest; for
whenever we shot the dam, we saved the kids, and
added them to our ock. But, above all, the season
for curing the grapes coming on, I caused such a
prodigious quantity to be hung up in the sun, that I
believe, had we been at Alicant, where the raisins
of the sun are cured, we should have lled sixty or
eighty barrels; and these, with our bread, was a
great part of our food, and very good living too, I
assure you; for it isan exceeding nourishing food.
It was now harvest, and our crop in good order.
It was not the most plentiful increase I had seen in
the island, but, however, it was enough to answer
our end; for from our twenty-two bushels of barley,
we brought in and threshed out above two hundred
and twenty bushels, and the like in proportion of the
rice, which was store enough for our food to the next
harvest, though all the sixteen Spaniards had been on
shore with me; or, if we had been ready for a voyage,
it would very plentifully have victualled our ship, to
have carried us to any part of the world, that is to
say, of America. When we had thus housed and
secured our magazine of corn, we fell to work to
make more wicker-work ; viz. great baskets, in which
we kept it: and the Spaniard was very handy and
dexterous at this part, and often blamed me, that I
\
did;not -make somethings for defence, of this kind
of work; but I saw noneed of "it. - ~
~ And now having a full supply of food for all the
guests I expected, I gavethe Spaniard leavel to "go
over to the main", to see what he could do with those
he-had‘ "l"eft-"behind him there.‘ I gaveihiml astriot
charge. in writingrnot to bring any man with hirn,vwho
would not rst swear in the presence of himself, and
of theold savage, that he would no way injure, ‘ght
with, or attack the peirson he should nd in the island,
who was so kind ass-toi send for them, in order to their
deliverance; but tbat"~they‘wouldl stand by and de-
fend him against-a=l~'l~ such ‘attempts; and, wherever
they went, -wou~ldi- be entirely under, and subjected to,
his command; and that this should be put in writing,
and signed with their hands. How we were to have
this_sdone,_when -1 knew» they r-had neither pen nor ink,
that indeed was a question which we never asked.
Under these--instructions, the Spaniard, and the
old savage (the father of Friday), went away in one
of the canines, which they might be said to come
in, or rather were brought in, when they came as
prisoners to be devoured-by the savages.
- I -gave each of them a musket, with a'relock on
it, and about eight charges of powder and ‘ball,
charging them to be very good husbands of both,
and not to use either of them but upon urgent“ oc-
casion. ‘
’I.‘his~was a cheerful work, being the rst mea-
‘sirres used byrme, in view of my deliverance,’ for
now twenty-seven years and some days-. I gave
them provisions of bread, and of dried grapes, suf-
ficient for themselves for many days, and sufcient
for all their countrymen for about eight days’ time;
and wishing them a. good voyage, _I let them go,
agreeing with them about a signal they should hang
out at their return, bywhich I should know them
again, when theylcame back, ata distance, before
they came on shore. -
They went a'way,'with a fair gale, on the day that

about two leagues and a half’s distance from me;
S. S. but not above a league and a half from the
shore. By my observation, it appeared plainly to
be an English ship, and the boat appeared to be an
English long-boat.
I cannot express the confusion I was in, though
the joy of seeing a ship, and one which, I had rea-
son to believe, was manned by my own countrymen,
and consequently friends, was such as I cannot
describe; but yet I had some secret doubts hung
about me, I cannot tell from whence they came,
bidding me keep upon my guard. In the rst
place, it occurred to me to consider what busi-
ness an English ship could have in that part of the
world, since it was not the way to or from any
part of the world where the English had any traf-
c; and I knew there had been no storms to drive
them in there, as in distress; and that if they were
English really, it was most probable that they were
here upon no good design, and that I had better
continue as I was, than fall into the hands of thieves
and murderers.
Let no man despise the secret hints and notices
of danger, which sometimes are given him, when he
gnay think there is no possibility of its being real.
That such hints and notices are given us, I believe
few, that have made any observations of things, can
deny; that they arecertain discoveries of an invi-
sible world, and a converse of spirits, we cannot
doubt; and if the-tendency of them seems to be to
warn us of danger, why should we not suppose
they are from some friendly agent (whether su-
preme, or inferior and subordinate, is not the que-
stion), and that they are given for our good? .
The present question abundantly conrms me in
the justice of this reasoning; for had I not been
made cautious bypthis secret admonition, come it
from whence it will, I had been undone inevitably,
and in afar worse condition than before, as you will
see presently. . _ 1
' I had not kept myselflong in this posture, when I
saw the boat draw near the shore, as if they looked
for a creek to thrust in at, for the convenience of land-
ing: however, as they did not come quite far enough,
they \did not see the little inlet where I formerly
landed my rafts, but run their boat on shore upon
the beach, at about half a mile from me, which was
very happy for me; for otherwise they would have
landed just, as I may say, at my door, and would
soon have beaten me out of my castle, and, perhaps,
have plundered me of all I had.
When they were on shore, I was fully satised
they were Englishmen, at least, most of them : one
or two I thought. were Dutch, but it did not
prove so. There were in all eleven men, whereof
three I found were unarmed, and (as I thought)
bound; and when the rst four or ve of them
were jumped on shore, they took those three out of
the boat as prisoners. One of the three I could
perceive using the most passionate gestures of en-
treaty, aiiction, and despair, even to a kind of ex-
travagance ; the other two I could perceive lifted
up their hands sometimes, and appeared concerned
indeed, but not to such a degree as the rst.
1 was perfectly confounded at the sight, and knew
not what the meaning of it should be. Friday
called out to me, in English, as well as he could,
‘ 0 master, you see English mans eat prisoners as
well as savage mans.’ ‘ Why,’ said I, ‘ Friday, do
you think they are going to eat them then?’ ‘ Yes,’
says Friday, ‘ they will eat them.’ ‘ No, no,’ said I,
‘ Friday ; I am afraid they will murder them indeed;
but you may be sure they will not eat them.’
All this while, I had no thought of what the inat-
ter really was, but stood trembling with the horror
of the sight, expecting, every moment, when the
three prisoners should be killed; nay, once I saw
one of the villains lift up his arm, with a great cut~
lass (as the seamen call it) or sword, to strike one of
the poor men ; and I expected to see him fall every
moment, at which all the blood in my body seemed
to run chill in my veins.
I wished heartily now for my Spaniard, and the
savage that was gone with him; or that I had any
way to have come undiscovered within shot of them,
that I might have rescued the three men; for I saw
no -re-arms they had among them: but it fell out to
my mindianother way. -
After I had observedthe outrageous usage of the
three men, by the insolent seamen, I observed the
fellows ran scattering about the land, as il’ they
wanted to see the country. I observed also, that
the three other men had liberty to go where they
pleased; ‘but they sat down all three upon the
ground very pensive, and looked like men in de-'
spair. l <
This put me in mind of the rst time when I came
on shore, and began to look about me: how I gave
myself over for lost, how wildly I looked round me,
what dreadful apprehensions I had, and how I lodged
in the tree all night, for fear of being devoured by
wild beasts. ‘
As I knew nothing that night of the supply I was
to receive, by the providential driving of the ship
nearer the land, by the storms and tide, by which I
have since been so long nourished and supported ;
so these three poor, desolate men» knew nothing
how certain of deliverance and supply they were,
how near itwas to them, and howcffectually and
really they were in a condition of safety, at the
same time that they thought themselves lost, and
their case desperate. l '
So little do we see before us in the world, and so
much reason have we to depend cheerfully upon
the great Maker of the world,~that he does not
leave his creatures so absolutely destitute, but that
in the worst circumstances they have always some-
thing to be thankful for, and sometimes are nearer
their deliverance than they imagine; nay, are
even brought to their deliverance by the means _by
which they seem to be brought to their destruc-
tion.
It was just at the top of _high_-water when these
people camcon shore, and while partly they stood
parlyingwith the prisoners they brought, and partly
while they rambled about to see what kind of place
they were in, they had carelessly staid till the tide
was spent, and the water was ebbed considerably
away, leaving their boat aground.
They had left two men in the boat, who, as I
found afterwards, having drank a little too much
brandy, fell asleep. However, one of them waking
sooner than the other, and nding the boat too fast
aground for him to stir it, halloocd for the rest,
who were straggling about, upon which they all
soon came to the boat; but it was past all their
strength to launch her; the boat being very heavy,
and the shore on that side being a soft, oosy sand,
almost like a _quicksan_d.
In this condition, like true seamen, who are, per-
haps, the least of all mankind given to forethought,
they gave it over, and awaylthcy strolled about
the country again ; and I heard one of them say
aloud to another (c_alli_ng them off from the boat),
,' Why, let her alone, Jack, can’t ye? She’ll oat
next tide.’ By which I was fully conrmed in the
lmain inquiry, of what countrymen they were.
r All this while, I kept myself close, not once dar-
ing to stir out of my castle, any farther than to my
placeof observation, near the top of -the hill ; and
-very glad I was tolthinlchow well it was fortied.
I knewiit was no less than ten hours before the
boat couldibe aoat again,» and by that time it
would be dark, and I might be more at liberty to
sce..»their motions, and to hear their discourse, if
theyhed any. _ L
-» »I~n-the moan time, I ttedmyself up for a battle,
,as~before, though with more caution, knowing I had
to do with another kind of enemy than I had at
rst. I ordered Friday also,whon1 I had made an ex-
cellent marksman with his gun, to load himself with
arms. I took myself two fowling-pieces, and I gave
him three muskets. My gure indeed was very erce:
I had my formidable goat-skin coat on, with the great
cap I have mentioned, a naked sword by my side,
two pistols in my belt, and a gun upon each shoulder.
It was my design, as I said above, not to have
made any attempt till it was dark ; but about two
o’clock, being the. heat of the day, I found, that, in
short, they were all gone straggling into the wood/s,
and, as I thought, were all laid down to sleep. The
three poor distressed men, too anxious for their con-
dition to get any sleep, were, however, set down
under the shelter of a great tree, at about a quarter
of a mile from me, and, as I thought, out of sight of
any of the rest. '
Upon this, I resolved to discover myself to them,
~and learn something of their condition. Immedi-
ately I marched, in the gure above; my man Fri-
day at a good distance behind me, as formidable for
his arms as I, but not making quite so staring a spec-
tre-like gure as I did.
I I came as near them undiscovered as I could,
and then, before any of them saw me, I called
aloud to them, in Spanish, ‘ What are ye, gentle-
men?’ ' ~
They started up at the noise, but were ten times
-more confounded when they saw me, and the un-
'couth gure that I made. They made no answer
ut‘all', but I thought I perceived them just going to
'y from me, when I spoke to _ them in 1-lnglish:
‘ Gentlemen,’ said I, ‘ do not be surprised at me:
-perhaps you may have a friend near you, when you
did not expect it.’ ‘ He must be sent directly from
Heaven then,’ said one of them, very gravely-to me,
and pulling off his hat at the same time; ‘ for our
condition is past the help of man.’ ‘ All help is
from Heaven, sir,’ said 1. ‘ But can you put a
stranger in the way how to help you; for you seem to
me to be in some great distress? I saw you when you
landed ; and when you seemed to make application
to the brutes that came with you, I saw one of them
lift up his sword to kill you.’
The poor man, with tears running down his face.
and trembling, looking like one astonished, returned,
‘ Am I talking to God or man? Is it a real man, or
an angel?’ ‘ Be in no fear about that, sir,’ said I.
‘ If God had sent an -angel to relieve you, he would
have come better clothed, and aimed after another
manner, than you see me. Pray lay aside your
fears ; I am a man, an Englishman, and disposed to
assist you, you see. I have one servant only: we
have arms and ammunition. Tell us freely: can we
serve you 8 What is your case ?’
‘ Our case,’ said he, ‘ sir, is too long to tell you,
while our murderers are so near ; but, in short, sir,
I was commander of that ship ; my men having mu-
tinied against me, they have been hardly prevailed
on not to murder me, and, at last, have set me on
shore in this desolate place, with these two men
with me, one my mate, the other a passenger, where
we expected to perish, believing the place to be
uninhabited, and know not yet what to think of it.‘
‘ Where are those brutes, your enemies P‘ said I.
‘ Do you know where they are gone ?‘ ‘ There they
are, sir,’ said he, pointing to a thicket of trees. ‘ My
heart trembles for fear they have seen us, and
heard you speak; if they have, they will certainly
murder us all.’
‘ Have they any re-arms 9’ said I. I-Ie answered
they had only two pieces, ' and one which they left
in the boat. ‘ Well then,’ said I, ‘ leave the rest to
me. I see they are all asleep; It is an easy thing
to kill them all: but shall we rather take them
prisoners?’ He told me there were two desperate
villains among them, that it was scarce safe to show
any mercy to ; but if they were secured, he believed
all the rest would return to their duty. I asked
him which they were. Isle told me he could not at
that distance describe them; but he would obey
my orders in any thing I would direct. ‘ Well,’
said I, ‘ let us retreat out of their view or hearing,
lest they awake; and we will- resolve farther. So
they willingly went back with me, till the woods
covered us from them.
‘ Look you, sir,’ said I, " if I venture upon your
deliverance, are you willing to make two conditions
with me?’ I-I0 anticipated my proposals, by telling
me, that both he and the ship, if recovered, should
be wholly directed‘ and commanded by me in every
thing; and if the ship was not recovered, he would
live and die with me, in what part of the world so-
ever I would send him; and the two other men said
the same. ‘ .
‘ mVell,’ said I, ‘ my conditions are but two: rst,
'l'hat' while you stay on this island with me, you
will not pretend to any authority here; and if I
put arms into your hands, you will, upon all occa-
sions, give them up to me, and do no prejudice to
me or mine, upon this island; and, in the mean
time, be governed by my orders- . ,t . ,
Secondly, That if the ship is or may be recovered,
you will carry me and my man to England passage.
free. ~ . Y -
He gave me all the assurances that the invention
and faith of man could devise, that he would com-
ply with these most reasonable demands; and, be-
sides, would owe his life to me, and acknowledge it
upon all occasions as long as he 1ived.~ , i
‘ Well then,’ said I, ‘here are three muskets for
you, with powder and ball. Tell me next what you
think is proper to be done.’ He showed al-l the tes-
timony of his gratitude that he was able; but offered
to be wholly guided by me. I told him I thought
it was hard venturing any.thing,.but the best me,
thod I could think of, was to re upon them at
once, as they lay; and if any were not killed at the
rst volley, and offered to submit, we mightsavo
them, and so put it wholly upon God’s providence
to direct the shot.
“ He saidvery modestly, that he was loath to kill
them, ifwhc could‘ hclp it;’ but that those two
were incorrigible villains, and had been the authors
of all the mutiny in the ship; and if they escaped,
we should be undone still; for they would go on
board, and ~bring the whole ship’s company, and de-
stroy us all. w‘ Well then,’ said I, ‘ necessity legiti-
mates my advice; for it is the only way to save our
lives.’ However, seeing him still cautious of shed-
ding blood, I told him they should go themselves,
and manage as they found convenient. I
In the middle of this d-iscourse, we heard some
of them awake, and soon after we saw two of them
on their feet. I asked him if either of them were
the men who, he had said, were the heads of the
mutiny. I-Ie said, ‘ No.’ ‘ Well then) said I, ‘ you
may let them escape; and Providence seems to have
wakencd them on purpose to save themselves. Now,’
said I, ‘ if the rest escape you, it is your fault.’
Animated with this,. he took the musket I had
given him in his hand, and a pistol in his belt, and
his two comrades with him, with each man a piece
in his hand. The two men, who were with him,
going rst, made some noise, at which one of the
seamen, who was awake, turned about, and, seeing
them coming, cried out to the rest; but it was too
late then,. for the moment he cried out, they red,
I mean the two men, the captain wisely resewing
his own piece. They had so well aimed their shot
at the men they knew, that one of them was killed
on the spot, and the other very much wounded ;
but not being dead, he started up upon his feet,
and called eagerly for help to the other: but the
captain, stepping to him, told him it was too late
to cry for help; he should call upon God to forgive
his villany, and, with that word, knocked him
down, with the stock of his musket, so that he
never spoke more. The-re were three more in the
company, and one of them was also slightly wound-
ed. By this time I was come; and when they saw
N *2
their danger, and that it was invain-toovresist, they
begged for mercy. The captain told them, he would
spare their lives, if they would give him any‘assur-
ance of their abhorrence of the treachery they had
been guilty of, and would swear to be faithful to
him in recovering the ship, and afterwards in car-
rying her back to Jamaica, from whence they came.
They gave-him‘ all the protestations of their sin.
cerity that could be desired, and he was willing to
believe them, and spare theirllves, which I was not
against; Only I obliged him to keep them bound,
hand and foot, while they were upon the -island.
' While this iwas‘ doing, Iisent Friday, with the
captain's mate, to the boat, with orders to-secure
her, and bring away the oars and sail, which they
did‘; and, by-and-by, three straggling men, that
were (happily for -them) parted from the rest, came
back, upon hearing the g-uns red ; and seeing their
captain, who was before their prisoner, now their
conqueror, they submitted to be bound also; and so
ourfvictory was complete. .
It now remained that the captain andlishould
inquire into one another’s circumstances. I began
rst, and told him my whole history, which he
heard with an attention even to amazement, and
particularly at the wonderful manner of my being
furnished with provisions and ammunition; and in-
deed, as my story is a whole collection of wonders,
it" affected him deeply; but when he reected from
thence upon himself, and how I seemed to have
been preserved there on- purpose to save his life, the
tears ran down his -face, andhe could not speak a
word more. D V "
After this communication was at an end,’ I car-
ried \him, and his two men, into my apartment,
leading them in just where I came out, viz; at the
top oi’ the house, where I refreshed-them» with -such
provisions as I had, and showed them all the con~
trivances I had made, during my long, long inha-
biting that place. r
All I showed them, all I Said to them, was per-
fectly amazing; but, above all, the captain admired
my fortication, and how perfectly I had concealed
my retreat with a grove of trees, which having been
now planted near twenty years, and the trees grow-
ing much faster than in England, was become a
little wood, and so thick that it was impassable in
any part of it, but at that one side where I had
reserved my little winding passage into it. This I
told him was my castle, and my residence ; but that
I had a seat in the country, as most princes have,
whither I could retreat upon occasion, and 1 would
show him that too another time; but at present
our business was to consider, how to recover the
ship. Ile agreed with me as to that; but told me,
he was perfectly at a loss what measures to take,
for that there were still six-and-twenty hands on
board, who, having entered into a cursed conspiracy,
by which they had all forfeited their lives to the
law, would be hardened in it new by desperation,
and would carry it on, knowing that if they were
reduced, they should be brought to the gallows as
soon as they came to England, or to any of the
English colonies; and that therefore there would
be no attacking them with so small a number as
we were.
' I mused for some time upon what he had said,
and found it was a very rational conclusion; and
that therefore something was to be resolved on
very speedily, as well to draw the men on hoard
into some snare for their surprise, as to prevent
their landing upon us, and destroying us. Upon
this it presently occurred to me, that, in a little
while, the ship’s crew, wondering what was become
of their comrades, and of the boat, would cer-
tainly come on shore in their other boat, to see
for them; and that then, perhaps, they might come
armed, and be too strong for us: this, he allowed,
was rational. .
Upon this I told him the rst thing we had to do
was to stave the boat, which-lay upon the beach,
so that they might not carry her off; and taking
every thing out of her, leave her so far useless as
not to be t to swim. Accordingly we went on
board, took the arms which were left on board out
of her, and whatever else we found there, which
was a bottle of brandy, and another of rum, a few
biscuit cakes, a horn of powder, and a great lump of
sugar, in a piece of canvass; the sugar was ve or
six pounds: all which ‘was very welcome to nie,
especially the brandy and sugar, of which I had had
none left for many years.
\'}\/lien we had carried all these things on shore
(tho oars, mast, sail, and rudder of the boat were
carried away before, as above), we knocked a great
hole in her bottom, that if they had come strong
enough to master us, yet they could not carry oil‘
the boat.
Indeed it was not much in my thoughts, that we
could be capable to recover the ship; but my view
was, that if they went away without the boat, I did
not much question to make her t again to carry us
away to the Leeward Islands, and call upon our
friends, the Spaniards, in my way; for l had ‘them
still in my thoughts.
While we were thus preparing our designs, and
had rst, by main strength, heaved the boat up
upon the beach, so lll[:,‘l1"l2l‘l3.l1 the tido would not
float hcr oil’ at high-water mark; and, besides, had
broken a hole in her bottom too big to be quickly
stopped, and were sat down musing what we should
do, we heard the ship re a gun, and saw her make a
w aft with her ancient, as a signal for the boat to come
on hoard ; but no boat stirred, and they red seve-
ral times, making other signals for the boat.
At last, when all their signals and rings proved
fruitless, and they found the boat did not stir, we
saw them (by the help of my glasses) hoist an-
other boat out, and row towards the shore; and we
found, as they approached, that there were no less
rtonmson causes. 217
-than ten men in her, and that they had re-arms
with them.
- As the ship lay almost two leagues from the
-shore, we had a full view of them as they came,
and a plain sight of the men, even of their faces;
because the tide having set them a little to the east
of the other boat, they rowed up under shore, to
come to the same place where the other had landed,
and where the boat lay.
By this means, I say, we had a full view of them,
and the captain knew the persons and characters of
all the men in the boat, of whom he said that there
were three very honest fellows, who, he was sure,
were led into this conspiracy by the rest, being over-
powered and frighted. ' ~
But that as for the boatswain, who, it seems, was
the chief ofcer among them, and all the rest, they
were as outrageous as any of the ship’s crew; and
were, no doubt, made desperate in their new enter-
prise: and terribly apprehensive he was, that they
would be too powerful for us.
I smiled at him, and told him that men in our
eircumstances were past the operations of fear: that
seeing almost every condition that could be, was
better than that which we were supposed to be in,
we ought to expect that the consequence, whether
death or life, would be sure to be a deliverance.
I asked him what he thought of the circumstances
of my life; and whether a deliverance were not
worth venturing for. ‘ And where, sir,’ said I, ‘ is
your belief of my being preserved here on purpose
to save your life, which elevated you a little while
ago? For my part,’ said l, ‘ there seems to be but
one thing amiss in all the prospect of it.’ ‘ What's
that ?' said he. ‘ Why,’ said I, ‘ ’tis that, as you
say, there are three or four honest fellows among
them, which should be spared; had they been all
of the wicked part of the crew, I should have
thought G od‘s providence had singled them out, to
deliver them into your hands; for, depend upon it
every man of them that comes ashore are our own,
and shall die or live, ‘as they behave to us.’
As I_sp0.ke this with a raised voice and cheerful
countenance, _I, olund it greatly encouraged him;
so we set vigorously to our business. We had,
upon the rst appearance of the boat_’s coming from
the ship, considered of separating our prisoners, and
had indeed secured them eifectually.
Two of them, of whom the captain was less'as-
sured than ordinary, I sent with Friday, and one
of the, three delivered men, to my cave, where they
were remote enough, and out of dangerof being
heard or_ discovered, or of nding their way out of
the woods, if they could have delivered themselves.
Here they left them bound, but gave them provi-
sions, and promised them, if they continued there
quietly, to give them their liberty in a day or two ;
but that if they attempted their escape, they should
he put to death without mercy. _They, promised
faithfully to bear their connement with patience,
and were very thankful thattliey had such good
usageas to have provisions, and a light left them ;
for Friday gave them candles (such as we made
ourselves) for their comfort: and they did not
know but that he stood sentinel ‘over them at the
entrance. '
_- The other prisoners had better usage: two of
them were kept pinioned indeed, because the cap.
tain was not free to trust them ; but the other two
were taken into my service, upon their captain's
fecqmmendation, and upon their solemnly engaging
to live and die with us ; so, with them and the
three honest men, we were seven men, well armed;
and I made no doubt we should be able to deal well
enough __with the ten that were a coming, considering
that the captain had said there were three or four
honest men among them also.
As soon as they got to the place where their other
boat lay-,~ they ran their boat into the beach, and
came all on shore, hauling the boat up aftcrthem,
which I was glad to see; for I was afraid they
would rather have left the boat at an anchor, some
distance from the shore, with some hands in her to
guard her; and so we should not be able to seize
the boat.
Being on shore, the rst thing they did, they ran
all to the other boat; and-it was easy to see they
were under a great surprise, to nd her stripped,
as above, of all that was in her, and‘ a‘ great hole in
her bottom. '
After they had mused a while upon this, they set
up two or three great, shouts, hallooing with all
their might, to try if they could make their compa-
nions hear; but it was all to no purpose: then they
came all close in a ring, and red‘ a volley of their
small arms, which indeed we heard, and the echoes
made the woods ring : but it was all one; those in
the cave we were sure could not hear, and those in
our keeping, ‘though they heard it well enough, yet
durst give no answer to them.
They were so astonished at the surprise of this,
that, as they told us afterwards, they resolved to
go all on board again to their ship, and let them
know there, that the men were all murdered, and
the long-boat staved’; accordingly they immediately
launched their boat again, and got all of them on
board.
" The captain was terribly amazed, and even con-
founded at this, believing they would go on board
the ship again, and set sail, giving their comrades
for lost, and sohe should still lose the ship, which
he was in hopes we should have recovered : but he
was quickly as much frighted the other way.
They had not been long put off with the boat, but
we perceived them all coming on shore again; but
with this new measure in their conduct, which, it
seems, they consulted together upon; viz. to leave
three men in the boat, and the rest to go on shore,
and go up into the country to look for their fellows.
‘ This was a great disappointment to us; for now
we were atr a. loss wliattoldo; for our seizing those
seven men out shore would -be no advantage to us,
if we-rlctvthoboat escape; because they would then
row away to the ship; and then the rest of them
woui_d,bc sure to weigh, and set sail, and so our
hope .of,r.eco.vering the ship would be lost.
1-Iowever,-we had no remedy but to wait and see
what-the issue of things might present. The seven
menmcame.-on shore, and the three who remained
in the boat, put her off to a good (lilli-U100 from the
shore, and came to an anclior to wait for them ; 50
that it was impossible for us to come at them in
the boat.
Those that came on shore kept close together,
marching towards the top of the little hill, under
which my habitation lay; and we could see them
plainly, though they could not perceive us. We
could have been very glad they would have come
nearer to us, so that we might have red at them;
or that they would have gone farther off, that we
might have come abroad.
But when they were come to the brow of the hill,
where they could see a great way into the valleys and
woods, which lay towards the north-east part, and
where the island lay lowest, they shouted and hal-
looed till they were weary; and not caring, it
seems, to venture far from tho shore, nor far from
one another, they sat down together under a tree,
to consider of it. I-Iad they thought t to have
gone to sleep there, as the other part y of them had
done, they had done the job for us; but they were
too full of apprehensions of danger, to venture to go
to sleep, though they could not toll what the danger
was they had to fear neither.
The captain made a very just proposal to mo l1pOI1.
this consultation of theirs, viz. that perhaps they
would all re a volley again, to endeavour to make
their fellows hear, and that we should all sally upon
them, just at the juncture when their pieces were
all discharged, and they would certainly yield, and
we should have them without bloodshed. 1 liked
the proposal, provided it was done while we were
near enough to come up to them, before they could
load their pieces again.
But this event did not happen, and we lay still
a long time, very irresoluto what course to take:
at length I told them thcrc would be nothing to be
done in my opinion till night; and then, if they
did not return to the boat, perhaps we might nd
o wny to get between them and the shore, and so
might use some stratagem with them in tho boat, to
get them on shore. ; _ ;
We waited a great while, though very impatient
for their removing, and were very uneasy; when,
after long consultations, we saw them start all up,
and march down toward the sea. It seems, they
had such dreadful apprehensions upon them of the
danger of the place, that they resolved to go on
board the ship again, give their companions over for
lost, and solgo on with their intended voyage with
the ship.
As soon as I perceived them go towards the shore,
I imagined it to be as it really was, that they had
given over their search, and were for going back
again; and the captain, as soon as I told him my
thoughts, was ready to sink at the apprehensions or
it: but I presently thought of a stratagein to fetch
them back again, and which answered my end to
a tittle. '
I ordered Friday, and the captain’s mate, to go
over the little creek westward, towards the place
where the savages came on shore when Friday was
rescued, and as soon as they came to a little rising
ground, at about half a mile’s distance, I bade them
halloo as loud as they could, and wait till they
found the seamen hoard them; that as soon as
over they heard the seamen answer them, they
should return it again, and then keeping out of
sight, take a round, always answering when the
other hallooed, to draw them as far into the island
Q
A
and among the woods as possible; and then wheel
about again to me, by such ways as I directed.
They were just going into the boat, when Friday
and the mate hallooed, and they presently heard
them, and answering, run along the shore west-
ward, towards the voice they heard, when they
were presently stopped by the creek, where the
water being up, they could not get over, and called
for the boat to come up, and set them over, as in-
deed I expected.
When they had set themselves over, I observed
that the boat being gone up a good way into the
creek, and, as it were, in a harbour within the
land, they took one of the three men out of her to
go along with them, and left only two in the boat,
having fastened her to the stump of a little tree on
the shore.
This was what I wished for, and immediately
leaving Friday and the captain's mate to their busi-
ness, I took the rest with me, and crossing the
creek out of their sight, we surprised the two men
before they were aware, one of them lying on shore,
and the other being in the boat: the fellow on
shore was between sleeping‘ and waking, and going
to start up, the captain, who was foremost, ran
in upon him, and knocked him down, and then
called out to him in the boat toyield, or he was a
dead man. ‘
There needed very few arguments to persuade a
single man to yield, when he saw ve men upon
him, and his comrade knocked down; besides, this
was, it seems, one of the three who were not so
hearty in the mutiny as the rest of the crew, and
therefore was easily persuaded not only to yield,
but afterwards to join very sincerely with us.
In the mean time, Friday and the captain’s mate
so well managed their business with the rest, that
they drew them, by hallooing and answering, from
one hill to another, and from one wood to another,
till they not only heartily tired them, but left them
where they were very sure they could not reach
back to the boat before it was dark; and indeed
they were heartily tired themselves also by the
time they came back to us. g
We had nothing now to do but to watch for them
in the dark, and to fall upon them, so as to make
sure work with them.
' It was several hours after Friday came back to
me, before they came back to their boat; and we
could hear the foremost of them,'1ong before they
came quite up, calling to those behind to come
along, and could also hear them answer, and com-
plain how lame land tired they were, and not able
to come any faster, which was very welcome news
to us.
At length they came up to the boat; but it is
impossible to express their confusion when they
found the boat fast‘ aground in the creek, the tide
ebbed out, and their two men gone: we could hear
them call to one another, in a most lamentable man-
ner, telling one another they were gotten into an
enchanted island; that either there were inhabitants
in it, and they should all be murdered, or else there
were devils or spirits in it, and they should be all
carried away and devoured.
They hallooed again, and called their two com-
rades by their names a great many times, but no
answer. After some time, we could see them, by
the little light there was, run about wringing their
hands, like men in despair; and that sometimes
they would go and sit down in the boat to rest
themselves, then come ashore again, and walk about
again, and so the same thing over again.
‘ My men would fain have had me given them
leave to fall upon them at once in the dark; but
I was willing to take them at some advantage, so
to spare them, and kill as few of them’ as I could§
and especially I was unwilling to hazard the killing
any of our own men, knowing the other were very
well armed. I resolved to wait to sec if they didnot
\
sepzuate, and therefore, to make sure of them, I
drew my ambuscade ncaler, and ordered Fraday
and the eaptam to creep upon thelr hands and
feet, as (lose to the ground as they could, that they
mxght not be dxstovered, and get as near them es
they poss1hly could, before they offered to re.
They had not been long m that posture, when
the boatswam, who was the pnnc1pa1 rmgleadel of
the mutmy, and had now shown huuself the most
dejected and dlspmted of all the xest, came walkmg
to\v’ards them, vnth two more of their crew‘ The
captam vx as so eager, at havmg the prmupal rogue
so much m hrs power, that he could hardly have
patxente to let h1m come so near as to be sme of
lnm, for he only heard hls tongue befomc: but
when thev came nearer, the captaln and Fnday,
star tmg hp on thelr feet, let y at them.
'lhe boatswaln was kxlled upon the spot: the next
man was shot mto the body, and fell _]L1St by lnrn,
though he dxd not (he 1;111 an hour 01 two aftex;

At the norse of the re, I 1mmed1a,toly advanced

We came upop them mdeed m the dark, so that
they could not see om number, and 1 made the
man they had left m the boat, who was how one of
us, to cal1'them by name, to try 1f I copld, hrmg

he calls out, as loqd as he coyld, t0-IQIIQ of them,
‘ Tom Sm1th' Tom iimlflll" Torn,,Sx;;1th xanswen
ed 1mmed1a.tely, ‘whpis thgt? R,ob1hson,?;’ Jgr 1:;
seems he knew his \'0lpP. The,otl1err answered,
‘ Aye, aye _. for God’s sake, Tom $m1th, throw down
your arms, and yield; or you are all dead men this
moment !’ ~
-‘ Who must we yield to? .where are gthev?’ says
Smith ._again. ‘ Here they are,’ says he. ‘Here is
our captain, and fty men with him, have been
hunting you this two hours. The boatswain» is
killed, Will Frye is wounded, and I» am a‘ prisoner;
and if you do not yield, you are all lost.’ ' -
. ‘ Will they give us 'ql1?ll‘l26I‘-111163.11?’ says Tom Smith,
‘ and we will yield.’ ‘ I’l1 go‘ and ask, if you? pro-’
mise to yield,’ says Robinson. So- he asked the
captain, and the captain himself then calls out,
‘_ You, Smith, you know my voice: if you" lay down
your arms immediately, and submit, you shall have
you-r lives, all.but Will Atkins.’ i
Upon this, Will Atkins cried out,‘ For God’s
sake, captain, give me quarter ! What have I done?
They have been all as bad as,I !’ which, ‘by the way,
was not true neither; for it seems this Will Atkins
was the rst man that laid hold of the captain, when
they rst mutinied, and used him -barbarously, in
tying his hands, and giving him injurious ‘language.
However, the captain told him hemust laydown his
arms at discretion, and trust to the Governor-’s
mercy, by which he meant me: for they all called
me governor. _ ~ l
In a word, they all laiddown their arms, and
begged their lives; and I sent the man that had par-
leyed with them, and two more, who bound them all;
and then my great army of fty men, which, particu-
larly with those three, were all but eight, came up,
iwdlseized upon them all, and upon their boat, only
that I kept myself, and one more, out of sight, for
reasons of state. . . . -
A Our‘ next work was to repairthe boat, and to
think of seizing the ship; and as for the captain,
now he had leisure to parley with them, he expostu-
lated with them upon the villany of ~ theirpractices
with him, and, at length, upon the farther wicked-
ness of their design; and how certainly it must
bring them to misery and distress in the end, and
perhaps to the gallows.
They all appeared very penitent, and begged hard
for their lives. As for that, he told them they were
none of his prisoners, but the commander’s of the
island; that they thought they had set him on
shore in a barren, uninhabited island, but it had
pleased God so to direct them, that the island was
inhabited, and that the governor was an English-
man; that he might hang them all there, if he
pleased ; but as he had given them all quarter, he
supposed he would send them to England to be
dealt with there as justice required, except Atkins,
whom he was commanded by the governor to advise
to prepare for death; for that he would be hanged
in the morning.
Though this was all a ction of his own, yet it
had its desired effect: Atkins fell upon his knees to
beg the captain to iutercede with the governor for
his life; and all the rest begged of him, for God's
sake, that they might not be sent to England.
It now occurred to me that the time of our deli-
verance was come, and that it would be a most
easy thing to bring these fellows in, to be hearty in
getting possession of the ship. ,,;So I retired in the
dark from them, that they might not see what kind
of a governor they had, and called the captain to
me. When I called, as at a good distance, one of
the men was ordered to speak again, and say to the
captain, ‘ Captain, the commander calls for you ;'
and presently the captain replied, ".l.‘ell his excel-
lency, I am just acoming.’ This more perfectly
amused them; and they all believed that the com—
mander was just by, with his fifty men.
Upon the captain’s coming to me, I told him my
project for seizing the ship, which he liked of won-
derfully well, and resolved to put it in execution
the next morning. _ l
.But, in order to execute it with more art, and to
be secure of success, 1 told him we must divide the
prisoners, and that he should go and take Atkins,
and two more of the worst of them, and send them
pinioned to the cave where the others lay. This
was committed to Friday, and the two men who
came on shore with the captain.
They conveyed them to the cave, as to a prison ;
and it was indeed a dismal place, especially to men
in their condition.
The other I ordered to my bower, as I called it,
of which I have given a full description; and as it
was fenced in, and they pinioned, the place was
secure enough, considering they were upon their
behaviour. g
To these, in the morning, I sent the captain, who
was to enter into a parley with them ; in aword, to
try them, and tell me whether he thought they
might be trusted or no, to go on board, and surprise
the ship. He talked to_ them of the injury done
him, of the condition they were brought to; and
that though the governor had given them quarter
for their lives, as to the present action, yet that if
they were sent to England, they would all be
hanged in chains to be sure; but that if they would
join in so just an attempt, as to recover the ship,
he would have the governor’s engagement for their
pardon. - ~
Any one may guess how readily such a proposal
would be accepted by men in their condition; they
fell down on their knees to the captain, and pro-
mised,‘ with the deepest imprecations, that they
would be faithful to him to the last drop, and that
they should owe their-lives to him, and would go
with him all over the world; that they would own
him fora father to them as long as they lived.
‘ Well,’ says the captain, ‘ I must go and tell the
governor what you say, and see what I can do to
bring him to consent to it. So he brought me an
account of the temper he found them in; and that
he verily believed they would be faithful.
However, that we might be very secure, I told
him he should go back-again, and choose out‘ ve
of them, and tell them that theyshould see that
they did not want men; but he would take out
those ve to be his assistants, and that the gover-
nor would keep the other -two, and the three that
were sent prisoners -to. the castle (myzoave), as host-
ages, for the delity of those ve ; and that if they
proved unfaithful in the-execution, therve hostages
should be hanged -in-chains‘-alive upon the shore.
This looked sevoreyanri convinced 'them,:th'at the
governor was in earnest. However, theyhad no
way left them butto aooopt it; and it was now the
business of the prisoners, as much as of the captain,
to persuade the other ve to do their duty.
Our strength was nowthus ordered for the expe-
dition : First, The captain, his mate, and passenger.
Second, Then the two prisoners -of the rst gang,
to whom-, having their characters from the ‘captain,
I.had given their liberty, -and trusted them with
arms. Third, The other two, -whom I had kept till
now in my bower pinioned ; but, upon the captain’s
motion, had now -released. Fourth, These ve re-
leased at last: so that they were twelve in all, be-
sides ve we kept prisoners in the cave for hostages.
I asked the captain, if he was willing to venture
with these hands on board the ship; for, as for me
and my man Friday, I did not think it was proper
for us to stir, having seven men left behind; and it
was employment enough for us to keep them asun-
der, and supply them with victuals.
As to the ve in the cave, I resolved to keep them-
fast; but Friday went. twice a day tethem, to sup.
ply them with necessaries: and I made the other
two carry provisions ‘to a certain distance, where
Friday was to take it. ~ ‘ ‘
When I showed myself to the two hostages, it
was with the captain, who told them I was the per-l
son the governor had orderedto look after them,
and that it was the govcrnor’s pleasure they should
not stir any where, but by my direction; that if they
did, they should be fetchedinto the castle, and be
laid in irons: so that as we never suifered them to
see me as governor, so I now appeared as another
person, and spoke of they governor, the garrison, the
castle, and the‘like,’upon=all occasions. . - -
The captain now had no-*diicu_lty. before him,
but to furnish histwo boats, stop the breach of one,
and man them. Ileimd his passenger captain of
one,. with four other =_me,n; and himself, and his
mate, and ‘ve more, went in the othex-.~,. And they
contrived their, business very Wlls; for they came
up to the shiprabout midnight. ,As-soon as they
came witl1_in_call.o_1:';i the ship, he made Robinson
hail them,-. and tell them .he had broug,ht.~o' the
men and the boat, .bnt.that, it, was a long time be-
fore they had found them, and the like»; holding
them in a chat, till they came to, the ship's side:
when the captain andtthe mate, ‘entering rst with
their arms, immediate] y_knocked-. down the second
mate and (carpenter with the butt-end of their mus.
kets, beinggvery faithfully seconded;-by their men.
They secured all the-,rest~that.~were upon the main
and quarter-decks, and began» to fasten the hatches
to keep them down who were below, when the other
boat,.=and their men-> entering at. the foreschains, se-
cured the forecastle of. the; ship, and themskuttle
w_hich~went down into the cool<-rnom,- making three
menthey found thereiprisoners. <- . , . _¢.~
When this was done, and all safe upon the~deck,
the captain ordered the mate, with, three men, to
break into the round-house,» where the~~new rebel
captain'la.Y>.,and,»~having taken tllmalarm,-.was gotten
up, and,-';1vitl1-.,l;_.W0 men and aiboy, had gotten re.
arins-,in_tl1gir,,lxands,;»and when,» the mate»,¢wiu, 3,
crow, split open the door, the.n.ew;c2.ptain and -his
men red boldiy among theme-and~~ woundedithe
mate w-ith_a ball; which brpkehis arm,*and
wounded two more, othe men, butkilled nobody.
The mate, calling for help, rushed, however, into
the round-house, wounded as he was, and, with his
, ‘O
pistol, shot the new captain through the head, the
bullet entering at his mouth, and came out again
behind one of his ears; so that he never spoke a
word: upon which the rest yielded, and the ship was
taken eftectually, without any more lives lost.
As soon as the ship was thus secured, the captain
ordered seven guns to be red, which was the sig-
nal agreed upon with me, to give me notice of his
success, which, you may be sure, I was very glad to
hear, having sat watching upon the shore for it, till
near two of the clock in the morning.
Having thus heard the signal plainly, I laid me
down; and it having been a day of great fatigue to
me, I slept very sound, till I was something sur-
prised with the noise of a gun; and presently start-
ing up, I heard a man call me by the name of
‘ Governor, governor,’ and presently I knew the
captain’s voice, when climbing up to the top of the
hill, there he stood, and pointing to the ship, he
embraced me in his arms. ‘ My dear friend and
deliverer,’ says he, ‘ there's your ship ; for she is
all yours, and so are we, and all that belong to
her.’ I cast my eyes to the ship, and there she
rode within little more than half a mile of the
shore ; for they had weighed her anchor as soon as
they were masters of her, and the weather being
fair, had brought her to an anchor just against the
mouth of a little creek ; and the tide being up, the
captain had brought the pinnace in near the place
where 1 rst landed my rafts, and so landed just
at my door. -
I was, at rst, ready to sink down with the sur-
prise; for I saw my deliverance indeed visibly put
into my hands, all things easy, and a large ship just
ready to carry me away, whither 1 pleased to go.
At rst, for some time, I was not able to answer
one word; but as he had taken me in his arms, I
held fast by him, or I should have fallen to the
ground.
He perceived the surprise, and immcdiatcl y pulls
a bottle out of his pocket, and gave me a dram of
cordial, which he had brought on purpose for me.
After I drank it, I sat down upon the ground, and
though it brought me to myself, yet it was a good
while before I could speak a word to him.
All this while, the poor man was in as great an
ecstasy as I, only not under any surprise, as I was;
and he said a thousand kind, tender things to me,
to compose and bring me to myself; but such was
the ood of joy in my breast, that it put all my
spirits into confusion : at last, it broke out into tears,
and in a little while after I recovered my speech.
Then I took my turn, and embraced him as my
deliverer; and we rejoiced together. I told him,
I looked upon him as a man sent from heaven to
deliver me, and that the whole transaction seemed
to be a chain of wonders; that such things as these
were the testimonies we had of a secret hand of
Providence governing the world, and an evidence
that the eyes of an innite power could search into
the rcmotest corner of the world, and send help to
the miserable whenever he pleased.
I forgot not to lift up my heart in thankfulncss
to Heaven ; and what heart could forbear to bless
him, _who had not only, in a miraculous manner,
provided for one in such a wilderness, and in such
a desolate condition, but from whom every deliver~
ance must always be acknowledged to proceed !
When we had talked awhile, the captain told me
he had brought me some little refreshment, such
as the ship afforded, and such as the wretches, who
had been so long his masters, had not plundered
him of. Upon this, he called aloud to the boat,
and bade his men bring the things ashore, that
were for the governor; and indeed it was a pre-
sent, as if I had been one, not that was to be car-
ried away along with them, but as if I had been to
dwell upon the island still, and they were to go
without me.
First, he had brought me a case of bottles full of
excellent cordial waters, six large bottles of Ma-
deira wine, the bottles held two quarts a piece,
two pounds of excellent good tobacco, twelve good
pieces of the ship’s beef, and six pieces of pork,
with a bag of pease, and about a hundred weight of
biscuit.
He brought me also a box of sugar, a box of
our, a bag full of lemons, and two bottles of lime
juice, and abundance of other things. But, besides
these, and what was a thousand times more useful
to me, he brought me six clean, new shirts, six very
good neckcloths, two pair of gloves, one pair of
shoes, a hat, and one pair of stockings, and a very
good suit of clothes of his own, which had been
worn but very little: in a word, he clothed me from
head to foot.
It was a very kind and agreeable present, as any
one may imagine, to one in my circumstances ; but
never was any thing in the world of that kind so
unpleasant, awkward, and uneasy as it was to me to
wear such clothes at their rst putting on.
After these ceremonies past, and after all his
good things were brought into my little apartment,
we began to consult what was to be done with the
-prisoners we had; for it was worth considering,
whether we might venture to take them away with
us or no, especially two of them, whom we knew
to be incorrigible and refractory to the last degree;
and the captain said he knew that they were such
rogues, that there was no obliging them; and if he
did carry them away, it must be in irons, as male-
factors, to be delivered over to justice, at the rst
English colony he could come at; and I found that
the captain himself was very anxious about it.
Upon this, I told him, that, if he desired it, I
durst undertake to bring the two men he spoke of,
to make it their own request that he should leave
them upon the island. ‘ I should be very glad of
that,’ says the captain, ‘ with all my heart.’
‘ Well,’ said I, ‘I will send for them, and talk
with them for you.’ So I caused Friday and the
two hostages, for they were now discharged, their
comrades having performed their promise; I say, I
caused them to go to the cave, and bring up the ve
men, pinioned as they were, to the bower, and keep
them there till I came.
After some time, I came thither, dressed in my
new habit, and now I was called governor again.
Being all met, and the captain with me, I caused
the men to be brought before me, and I told them
I had had a full account of their villanous beha-
viour to the captain, and how they had run away
with the ship, and were preparing to commit far-
ther robberies; but that Providence had ensnared
them in their own ways, and that they -were fallen
into the pit which they had digged for others.
I let them know that, by my direction, the ship
had been seized ; that she lay now in the road, and
they might see by-and-by that their new captain
had received the reward of his villany; for that
they might see him hanging at the yard-arm.
That as to them, I wanted to know what they had
to say, why I should not execute them as pirates,
taken in the fact, as by my commission they could
not doubt I had authority to do.
One of them answered in the name of the rest,
that they had nothing to say but this, that when
they were taken, the captain promised them their
lives, and they humbly implored my mercy. But I
told them I knew not what mercy to show them ;
for, as for myself, I had resolved to quit the island
with all my men, and had taken passage with the
captain to go for England: and as for the captain,
he could not carry them to England, other than as
prisoners in irons, to be tried for mutiny and run-
ning away with the. ship; the consequence of which,
they must needs know, would be the gallows: so
that I could not tell which was best for them, un~
less they had a mind to take their fate in the island ;
if they desired that, I did not care, as 1 had liberty
to leave it. I had some inclination to give them
their lives, if they thought they could shift on
shore. They seemed very thankful for it; said they
would much rather venture to stay there, than to
be carried to England to be hanged: so I left it on
that issue.
- However, the captain seemed to make some dii-
culty of it, as if he durst not leave them there.
Upon this I seemed a little angry with the captain,
and told him that they were my prisoners, not his;
and that seeing I had o’cred them so much favour,
I would be as good as my word; and that if he did
not think fit to consent to it, I would set them at
liberty as I found them; and if he did not like
that, he might take them again, if he could catch
them. -
Upon this they appeared very thankful, and I
accordingly set them at liberty, and bade them re-
tire into the woods, to the place whence they came,
and I would leave them some re-arms, some am-
munition, and some directions how they should live
very well, if they thought t.
Upon this I prepared to go on board the ship ;
but told the captain that I would stay that night to
prepare my things, and desired him to go on board
in the mean time, and keep all right in the ship, and
send the boat‘ on shore the next day for me; order-
ing him in the mean time to cause the new captain
who was killed, to be hanged at the yard-arm, that
these men might see him.
When the captain was gone, I sent for the men
up to me in my apartment, and entered seriously
into discourse with them of their circumstances. I
told them, I thought they had made a right choice ;
that if the captain carried them away, they would
certainly be hanged. T showed them the new cap-
tain hanging at the yard-arm of the ship, and told
them they had nothing less to expect.
When they had all declared their willingness to
$tay, I then told them, I would let them into the
\
‘Q
story of my living there, and put them into the
way of making it easy to them. Accordingly I
gave them the whole history of the place, and of
my coming to it; showed them my fortications,
the way I made my bread, planted my corn, cured
my grapes; and, in :1. word, all that was necessary
to maize them easy. I told them the story also of
the sixteen Spaniards that were to be expected; for
whom I left a letter, and mzide them promise to
treat them in common with themselves.
I left them my re-arms; viz. ve musliets, three
fowling-pieces, and three swords. I had about a.
barrel and ahall’ of powder left; for after the rst
year or two I used but little, and wasted none. I
gave them n description of the way I managed the
goats. and directions to milk and fatten them, to
make both butter and cheese.
In a word, I gave them every part of my own
story; and I told them I would prevail with the
captain to leave them two barrels of gunpowder
more, and some garden-seeds, which T told them I
would have been very glad of; also I gave them
the bag of pease which the captain had brought me to
eat, and bade them be sure to sow and increase them.
Having done all this, [left them the next day,
and went on board the ship. We prepared imme-
diately to sail, but did not weigh that night. The
next morning early, two of the ve men came
swimming to the ship’s side, and, making a most
lamentable complaint of the other three, begged to
be taken into the ship, for God’s sake, for they
should be murdered; and begged the captain to
take them on board, though he hanged them im-
mediately. . -
Upon this, the captain pretended to have no
power without me ; but after some difculty, and
after their solemn promises oi’ amendment, they
were taken on board, and were some time after
soundly whipped and pickled; after ‘which they
proved very honest and quiet fellows.
Some time after this, I went with the boat on
shore, the tide being up, with the things promised
to the men, to which the captain, at my interces-
sion, caused their chests and clothes to be added,
which they tgok, and were very thankful for. I
also encouraged them, by telling them that if it lay
in my way to send any vessel to take them in, I
would not forget them.
When I took leave of this island, I carried on
board, for relics, the great goat-skin cap I had
made, my umbrella, and one of my parrots; also I
forgot not to take the money I formerly mentioned,
which had lien by me so long useless, that it was
grown rusty, or tarnished, and could hardly pass
for silver, till it had been a little rubbed and
handled; and also the money I found in the wreck
of the Spanish ship.
And thus I left the isla‘nd, the nineteenth of De-
cember, as I found, by the ship's account, in the
year 1686, after I had been upon it eight-and-twem
ty years, two months, and nineteen days; being
delivered from the second captivity the same day
of the month that I rst made my escape in the
barco-longo, from among the Moors of Sallee.
In this vessel, after a long voyage, I arrived in
England the eleventh of June, in the year 1687, hav-
ing been thirty-and-ve years absent.
When I came to England, I was as perfect a stran-
ger to all the world, as if I had never been known
there._ My benefactor and faithful steward, whom
‘I had left in trust with my money, was alive, but
had had great misfortunes in the world, was be-
come a widow the second time, and very low in the
world. I made her easy as to what she owed me,
assuring her I would give her no trouble; but, on
the contrary, in gratitude to her former care and
falthl’ulnc~ss to me, I relieved her as my little stock
would afford, which at that time would indeed
allow mc t<; lo but little for her; but I assured her
l would never forget her former kindness to me:
nor did I forget her, when I had sufficient to help
her, as ‘shall be observed in its place.
I went down afterwards into Yorkshire ; but my
father was dead, and my mother, and all the family
extinct, except that I- found two sisters, and two of
the children of one of my brothers; and as I had
been long ago given over for dead, there had been
no provision made for me, so that, in a word, I found
nothing to relieve or assist me ; and that the little
money 1 had, would not do much for me, as to
settling in the world.
'.l met with one piece of gratitude, indeed, which
I did not expect; and this was, that the master of
the ship, whom I had so happily delivered,‘and, by
the same means, saved the ship and cargo. having
given a very handsome account to the owners of
the manner how I had saved the lives of the men
and the ship, they invited me to meet them, and
some other merchants concerned, and all together
made me a very handsome compliment upon the
subject, and a present of almost two hundred pounds
sterling.
But, after mal<ing_ several reections upon the cir-
cumstances of my life, and how little way this
wouldigo toward settling me in the world, I re-
solved to go to Lisbon, and see il’I might not come
by some information of the state of my plantation
in the Brasils, and of what was become of my part-
ner, who, 1 had reason to suppose, had some years
now given me over for dead.
With this view, I took shipping for Lisbon, where
I arrived in April following: my man Friday ac-
companying me very honestly in all these ram-
blings, and proving a most faithful servant upon all
occasions. A '
When I came to Lisbon, I found out by inquiry,
and to my particular-satisfaction, my old friend, the
captain of the ship, who rst took me up at sea,
off the shore of Afric. I-le was now grown old, and
had left o’ the sea, having put his son, who was
O Q.
far from a young man, into his ship, and who still
used the Brasil trade. The old man did not know
me, and indeed I hardly knew him; but I soon
brought myself to his remembrance, when I told
him who I was.
After some passionate expressions of our old ac-
quaintance, I inquired, you may be sure, after my
plantation and my partner. The old man told me
he had not been in the Brasils for about nine years;
but that he could assure me, that when he came
away my partner was living, but the trustees, whom
I had joined with him to take cognisance of my
part, were both dead; that, however, he believed
that I would have a very good account of the im-
provement of the plantation, for that, upon the ge-
neral belief of my being cast away and drowned,
my trustees had given in the account of the pro-
duce of my part of the plantation to the proeurator
scal, who had appropriated it, in case I never
came to claim it, one third to the king, and two
thirds to the monastery of St. Augustine, to be ex-
pended for the benet of' the poor, and for the
conversion of the Indians to the catholic faith ; but
that if I appeared, -or any one for me, to claim the
inheritance, it would be restored; only that the im-
provement, or annual production, being distributed
to charitable uses, could not be restored: but he
assured me, that the steward of the kiug’s revenue
(from lands), and the provedore, or steward of the
monastery, had taken great care all along, that the
incumbent, that is to say, my partner, gave every
year a faithful account of the produce, of which
they received duly my moiety.
I asked him if he knew to what height of improve-
ment he had brought the plantation; and whether
he thought it might be worth looking after; or
whether, on my going thither, I should meet with
no obstruction to my possessing my just right in the
-moiety.
He told me he could not tell exactly to what
degree the plantation was improved; but this he
knew, that my partner was grown exceeding rich
upon the enjoying but one half of it: and that, to
the best of his remembrance, he had heard that the
king’s third of my part, which was, it seems, granted
away to some other monastery, or religious house,
amounted to above two hundred moidores a year;
that, as to my being restored to a quiet possession
of it, there was no question to be made of that, my
partner being alive to witness my title, and my
name being also enrolled in the register of the coun-
try. Also he told me, that the survivors of my two
trustees were very fair, honest people, and very
wealthy; and he believed I would not only have
their assistance for putting me in possession, but
would nd a very considerable sum of money in
their hands, for my account, being the produce of
the farm, while their fathers held the trust, and
before it was given up, as above, which, as he rc~
membered, was for about twelve years.
I showed myself a little concerned and uneasy at
this account, and inquired of the old captain how
it came to pass that the trustees should thus dis-
pose of my effects, when he knew that I had made
my will, and had made him, the Portuguese captain,
my universal heir, &c.
g He told me that was true, but that as there was
no proof of my being dead, he could not act as
executor, until some certain account should come
of my death; and that, besides, he was not willing
to intermeddle with a thing so remote: that it was
true, he had registered my will, and put in his
claim; and could he have given any account of my
being dead or alive, he would have acted by pro-
curation, and taken possession of the ingenio (so
they called the sugar-house), and had given his son,
who was now at the Brasils, order to do it.
‘ But,’ says the old man, ‘ I have one piece of
news to tell you, which perhaps may not be so
acceptable to you as the rest; and that is, that, be-
licving you were lost, and all the world believing
so also, your partner and trustees did o’er to ac-
count to me, in your name, for six or eight of the
rst years of pr(>llLS, which I received; but there
being at that Lime,’ says he, ‘ great disbursements
for increasing the works, building an ingenio, and
buying slaves, it did not amount to near so much as
afterwards it produced. However,’ says the old
man, ‘ I shall give you a true account of what I
have received in all, and how I have disposed of it.’
After a few days farther conference with this an-
cient friend, hc brought me an account of the rst
six years’ income of my plantation, signed by my
partner, and the merehant’s trustees, being always
delivered in goods; viz. tobacco in roll, and sugar
in chests, besides rum, molasses, &:c. which is the
consequence of a sugar work; and I found, by this
account, that every year the income considerably
increased. But, as above, the disbursement being
large, the sum at rst was small. However, the old
man let me see that he was debtor to me four hun~
dred and seventy-moidores of gold, besides sixty
chests of sugar, and fteen double rolls of tobacco,
which wz; ‘e lost in his ship, he having been ship-
wrecked coming home to Lisbon, about eleven years
after my leaving the place.
The good man then began to complain of his mis-
fortunes, and how he had been obliged to make
use of my money to recover his losses, and buy
him a share in a new ship. ‘ However, my old
friend,’ says he, ‘ you shall not want a supply in
your necessity; and as soon as my son returns, you
shall be fully satised.’
Upon this he pulls out an old pouch, and gives
me one hundred-and-sixty Portugal moidores in
gold ; and giving me the writings of his title to the
ship which his son was gone to the Brasils in, of
which he was a quarter-part owner,.and his son an-
other, he puts them both into my hands for security
of the rest.
I was too much moved with the honesty and
kindness of the poor man, to be able to bear this;
and remembering what he had done for me, how he
had taken me up at sea, and how generously he
had used me on all occasions, and particularly how
sincere a friend he was now to me, I could hardly
refrain weeping at what he said to me. Therefore,
rst I asked him if his circumstances admitted him
to spare so much money at that time, and if it
would not straiten him. He told me he could
not say but it might straiten him a little: but, how-
ever, it was my money, and I might want it more
than he.
Every thing the good man said was full of affec-
tion, and I could hardly refrain from tears while he
spoke. In short, I took one hundred of the moi-
dores, and called for. a pen and ink to give him a
receipt for them ; then I returned him the rest, and
told him, if ever 1 had possession of the plantation,
I would return the other to him also, as indeed I
afterwards did; and that, as to the bill of sale of
his part in his son’s ship, I would not take it by
any means; but that, if I wanted the money, I
found he was honest enough to pay me ; and if I
did not, but came to receive what he gave me rea-
son to expect, I would never have a penny more
from him.
When this was passed, the old man began to ask
me, if he should put me in a method to make my
claim to my plantation. I told him, I thought to
go over to it myself. He said, I might do so, if I
pleased; but that if I did not, there were ways
enough to secure my right, and immediately to ap-
propriate the prolits to my use ; and as there were
ships in the river of Lisbon,_just ready to go away
to Brasil, he made me enter my name in a public
register, with his aidavit, airming, upon oath, that
I was alive, and that I was the same person who
took up the laud for the planting the said plantation
at rst.
This being regularly attested by a notary, and a
procuration affixed, he directed me to send it with
a letter of his writing, to a merchant of his ac-
quaintance at the place; and then proposed my
staying with him till an account came of the
return.
Never any thing was more honourable than the
proceedings upon this procuration; for in less than
seven months I received a large packet from the
survivors of my trustees, the merchants for whose
account I went to sea, in which were the following
particular letters and papers enclosed:
First, There was the account current of the pro-
duce of ' my farm, or plantation, from the year when
their fathers had balanced with my old Portugal
captain, being for six years: the balance appeared
to be one thousand one hundredand seventy-four
moidores in my favour.
Secondly, There was the account of four years
more, while they kept the effects in their hands,
before the government claimed the administration,
as being the effects of a person not to be found,
which they call civil death; and the balance of this,
the value of the plantation increasing, was to an
amount in crusadoes, which made three thousand
two hundred and forty-one moidores.
Thirdly, There was the prior of. the Augustinefs
account, who had received the prots for above
fourteen years; but not being able to account for
what was disposed to the hospital, very honestly
declared he had eighthundred and seventy-two moi-
clores not distributed, which he acknowledged to
my account. As to the king’s part, that refunded
nothing. .
There was also a letter of my partner’s congratu-
-lating me very affectionately upon my being alive,
giving me an account how the estate was improved,
and what it produced a year, with a particular of
the number of squares or acres that it contained:
how planted; how many slaves there were upon it;
and, making two-and-twenty crosses for blessings,
told me he had said so many ‘Ave Marias,' to thank
the Blessed Virgin that I was alive; inviting me
very passionately to come over and take possession
of my own; and, in the mean time, to give him orders
to whom he should deliver my elfects, if I did not
come myself; concluding with a hearty tender of
his friendship, and that of his family; and sent me,
as a present, seven ne leopards’ skins, which he
had, it seems, received from Africa, by some other
ship, which he had sent thither, and who, it seems,
had made a better voyage than I. He sent me also
ve chests of excellent sweatmeats, and a hun-
dred pieces of gold uncoined, not quite so large as
moidores. .
By the same fleet, my two mercha_nt-trustees
shipped me twelve hundred chests of sugar, eight
hundred rolls of tobacco, and the rest of the whole
account in gold.
I might well say now, indeed, that the latter end
of Job was better than the begihning. It is impos-
sible to express the utterings of my very heart,
when I looked over these letters, and especially
when I found all my wealth about me; for as the
Brasil ships come all in eets, the same ships which
brought my letters brought my goods; and the
e’ects were safe in the Tagus before the letters came
to my hand. In a word, I turned pale, and grew
sick ; and had not the old man run and fetched me
a cordial, I believe the sudden surprise of joy had
overset nature, and I had died upon the spot.
Nay, after that, I continued very ill, and was so
some hours, till a physician being sent for, and
something of the real cause of my illness being
known, he ordered me to be let blood: after which
I had relief, and grew well; but I verily believe, if
it had not been eased by the vent given in that man-
ner to the spirits, I should have died.
I was now master, all on a sudden, of above
ve thousand pounds sterling in money, and had
an estate, as I might well call it, in the Brasils,
of above a thousand pounds a year, as sure as an
estate of lands in England; and, in a word, I was
in a condition which I scarce knew how to under-
stand, or how to compose myself for the enjoy-
ment of.
The rst thing I did, was to recompense my ori-
ginal benefactor, my goodold captain, who had
been” rst charitable to me in my distress, kind to
_me in the beginning, and honest to me at the end.
I showed him all that was sent me. I told him
that, next to the providence of I-Ieaven, which dis-
poses all things, it was owing to him; and that it
now lay on me to reward him, which I would do a
hundredfold. So I rst returned to him the hun-
dred moidores I had received of him; then I sent
for a notary, and caused him to draw up a general
release, or discharge, for the four hundred and
seventy moidores, which he had acknowledged he
owed me, in the fullest and rmest manner pos-
sible: after which, I caused a procuration to be
drawn, empowering him to be my receiver of the
annual prots of my plantation, and appointing my
partner to account to him, and make the returns by
the usual eets to him, in my name. And a clause
in the end, being a grant of one hundred moi-
dores a year to him, during his life, out of the
effects; and fty moidores a year to his son after
him, for his life: and thus~I requited my old man.
1 was new to consider which way to steer my
course next, and what to do with the estate that
Providence had thus put into my hands; and, in-
deed, I had more care upon my head now, than I
had in my silent state of life in the island, where I
wanted nothing but what I had, and had nothing
but what I wanted; whereas I had now a great
charge upon me, and my business was how to
secure it.‘ I had ne’er a cave now to hide my money
in, or a place where it might lie without lock or
key, till it grew mouldy and tarnished before any
‘body would meddle with it: on the contrary, I
knew not where to put it, or whom to trust with
it; my old patron the captain indeed was honest,
and that was the only refuge I had.
In the next place, my interest in the Br-asils
seemed to summon me thither; but now I could
not tell how to think of going thither till I had
settled my aairs, and left my effects in some safe
hands behind me. At rst, I thought of my old
friend the widow, who I knew was honest, and
would be just to me; but then she was in years,
and but poor, and, for aught I knew, might be in
debt; so that, in a word, I had no way but to go
back to England myself, and take my effects with
me. -
I was some months, however, before I resolved
"upon this ; and therefore as I had rewarded the old
captain fully, and to his satisfaction, who had been
my former benefactor, so I began to think of my
poor widow, whose husband had been my rst be.
nefactor, and she, while it was in her power, my
faithful steward and instructor. So the rst thing
I did, I got a merchant in Lisbon to write to his
correspondent in London, not only to pay a bill,
but to go nd her out, and carry her in money a
hundred pounds fr0m_1ne, and to talk with her,
and comfort her in her poverty, by telling her, she
should, if I lived, have a further supply. At the
same time, I sent my two sisters in the country,
each of them, a hundred pounds, they being,
though not in want, yet not in very good circum-
stances; one having been married, and left a
widow, and the other having a husband, not so
kind to her as he should be.
But among all my relations or acquaintances I
could not yet pitch upon one, to whom I durst
commit the gross of my stock, that I might go away
to the Brasils, and leave things safe behind me ;
and this greatly perplexed me.
‘I had once a mind to have gone to the Brasils,
and have settled myself there; for I was, as it
\
were naturalized to the place; but I had some
little scruple in my mind about religion, which in-
sensibly drew me back, of which I shall say more
presently. However, it was not religion that kept
me from going thither for the present; and as I
had made no scruple of being openly of the religion
of the country all the while I was among them, so
neither did I yet; only that now and then having
of late thought more of it than formerly, when I
began to think of living and dying among them, I
began to regret my having professed myself a
papist, and thought it might not be the best reli-
gion to die with.
But, as I have said, this was not the main thing
that kept me from going to the Brasils, but that
really I did not know with whom to leave my
effects behind me; so I resolved at last to go to
England with them, where, if I arrived, I con-
cluded I should make some acquaintance, or nd
some relations that would be faithful to me: and
accordingly I prepared to go for England with all
my wealth. _
. In order to prepare things for my going home, I
rst (the Brasil fleet being just going away) rc-
solved to give answers suitable to the just and
faithful account of things I had from thence. And
rst to the prior of St. Augustine I wrote a letter
full of thanks for his just dealings, and the offer of
the eight hundred and seventy-two moidores, which
was undisposed ol’, which I desired might be given,
ve hundred to the monastery, and three hundred
and seventy-two to the poor, as the prior should
direct ; desiring the good padre’s prayers for me, and
the like.
I wrote next a letter of thanks to my two trus-
tees, with all the acknowledgement that so much
justice and honesty called for ; as for sending them
any present, they were far above having any occa-
sion for it.
Lastly, I wrote to my partner, acknowledging his
industry in the improving the plantation, and his
integrity in increasing the stock of the works, giv-
ing him instructions for his future government of
my part, according to the powers I had left with
my old patron, to whom I desired him to send what-
ever became due to me, till he should hear from me
more particularly; assuring him that it was my in-
tention not only to come to him, but to settle my-
self there for the remainder of my life: to this I
added a very handsome present of some Italian
Silks for his wife and two daughters, for such the
capte.in’s son informed me he had; with two pieces
of ne English broad-cloth, the best I could get in
Lisbon, ve pieces of black baize, and some Flanders
lace of a good value.
Having thus settled my affairs, sold my cargo,
and turned all my effects into good bills of ex-
change, my next difficulty was, which way to go to
England. I had been accustomed enough to the
sea, and yet I had a strange aversion to go to Eng-
land by sea at that time; and though I could give
no reason for it, yet the difficulty increased upon
me so much, that though I had once shipped my
baggage in order to go, yet I altered my mind, and
that not once, but two or three times.
It is true, I had been very unfortunate by sea, and
this might be one of the reasons: but let no man
slight the strong impulses of his own thoughts in
cases of such moment. Two of the ships which I had
singled out to go in, I mean more particularly
singled out than any other, that is to say, so as in
one of them to put my things on board, and in the
other to have agreed with the captain ; I say, two
of these ships miscarried, viz. one was taken by
the Algerincs, and the other was cast away on the
Start near Torbay, and all the people drowned ex-
cept three: so that in either of those vessels I had
been made miserable, and in which most, it was
hard to say.
'-
Having been thus harassed in my thoughts, my
old pilot, to whom I communicated every thing,
pressed me carncstly not to go by sea; but either
to go by land to the Groync, and cross over the
bay of Biscay to Rochelle, from whcnce it was but
an easy and safe journey by land to Paris, and so
to Calais and Dover; or to go up to Madrid, and so
all the way by land through France.
In a word, I was so prepossessed against my
going by sea at all, except from Calais to Dover,
that I resolved to travel all the way by land, which,
as I was not in haste, and did not value the charge,
was by much the plcasautcr way; and to make it
mbro so, my old captain brought an English gentle-
man, the son of a merchant in Lisbon, who was
willing to travel with mo: after which, we picked up
two more, who were English, and merchants also, and
two young Portuguese gentlemen, the last going to
Paris only; so that we were in all six of us, and
ve servants : the two merchants, and the two Por-
tuguese, contenting themselves with one servant
between two, to save the charge; and as for me,
I got an l?.nglish sailor to travel with me as a serv-
ant, besides my man Friday, who was too much a
stranger to be capable of supplying the place of a
servant upon the road.
In this manner I set out from Lisbon: and our
company being all very well mounted and armed,
we made a little troop, whereof they did mo the
honour to call mo Captain, as well because I
was the oldest man, as because I had two serv-
ants, and, indeed, was tho original of the whole
journey.
As 1 have troubled you with none of my sea
journals, so shall I trouble you with none of my
land journal: but some adventures that happened
to us in this tedious and dillicult journey, I must
not omit.
When we came to Madrid, we, being all of us
strangers to Spain, were willing to stay some time
to see the court of Spain, and to see what was
worth observing; but it being the latter part of the
summer, we hastened away, and set out from Ma-
drid about the middle of October. But when we
came to the edge of Navarre, we were alarmed at
several towns on the way, with an account that so
much snow was fallen on the French side of the
mountains, that several travellers were obliged to
come back to Pampeluna, after having attempted,
at an extreme hazard, to pass on.
When we came to Pampeluna itself, we found it
so inrlccd; and to me, that had been always used to
a hot climate, and indeed to countries where we
could scarce boar any clothes on, the cold was in-
sufferable. Nor indeed was it more painful than
it was surprising, to come but ten days before out
of the Old Castilc, where the weather was not
only warm, but very hot; and immediately to feel
a wind from the Pyrenean mountains, so very
keen, so severely cold, as to be intolerable, and to
endanger bt-numbing and porishing of our lingers
and toes.
Poor l-‘riday was really frighted when he saw the
mountains all covered with snow, and felt cold
weather, which ho had never seen or felt before in
his life.
To mend the matter, after we came to Pampe-
luna, it continued snowing with so much violence,
and so long, that tho people said winter was come
before its time, and the roads, which were diicult
before, were now quite impassable; in a word, the
snow lay in some places too thick for us to travel ;
and being not hard frozen, as is the case in north-
crn countries, there was no going without being
in danger of being buried alive every stop. We
staid no less than twenty days at Pznripeluna, when
(seeinil, the winter (20lTlll1{1,’ on, and no likelihood of
its being better, for it was the severest winter all
over Europe that had been known in many years) I
proposed that we should all go away to I-‘0nturabia_,
and there take shipping for Bourdeaux, which was
a very little voyage.
But’while we were considering this, there came
in four French gentlemen, who, having been stopped
on the French side of the passes, as we were on
the Spanish, had found out a guide, who, travers-
ing the country near the head of Languedoc, had
brought them over the mountains by such ways,
that they were not much incommoded with the
snow; and where they met with snow in any
qua-ntity, they said it was frozen hard enough to
bear them, and their horses.
We sent for this guide, who told us, he would
undertake to carry us the same way, with no haz-
ard from the snow, provided we were armed suf-
ciently to protect us from wild beasts; for he
said, upon these great snows, it was frequent for
some wolves to show themselves at the foot of the
mountains, being made ravenous for want of food,
the ground being covered with snow. We told him
we were well enough prepared for such creatures
as they were, if he would ensure us from a kind of
two-legged wolves, which we were told we were in
most danger from, especially on the French side of
the mountains.
He satised us there was no danger of that kind
in the way that we were to go. So we readily
agreed to follow him; as did also twelve other
gentlemen, with their servants, some French, some
Spanish, who, as I said, had attempted to go, and
were obliged to come back again.
Accordingly we all set out from Pampeluna, with
our guide, on the fteenth of November; and in-
deed, I was surprised, when, instead of going for-
ward, he came directly back with us, on the same
road that we came from Madrid, above twenty
miles; when having passed two rivers, and come
into the plain country, we found ourselves in a.
warm climate again, where the country was pleas-
ant, and no snow to be seen; but on a sudden.
turning to the left, he approached the mountains
another way ; and though it is true, the hills and
‘the precipices looked dreadful, yet he made so
many tours, such meanders, and led us by such
winding ways, we were insensibly passed the
height of the mountains, without being much en-
cumbered with the snow; and, all on a sudden, he
showed us the pleasant fruitful provinces of Lan-
guedoc and Gascoigne, all green and ourishing;
though indeed they were at a great distance, and
we had some rough way to pass yet. .
We were a little uneasy, however, when we
found it snowed one whole day, and at night so fast
that we could not travel; but he bade us be easy,
we should soon be past it all. We found, indeed,
that we began to descend every day, and to come
more north than before; and so, depending upon
our guide, we went on.
It was about two hours before night, when our
guide being something before us, and not just in
sight, out rushed three monstrous wolves, and after
them a bear, out of a hollow way, adjoining to a
thick wood. Two of the wolves ew upon the
guide, and had he been half a mile before us he
had been devoured indeed, before we could have
helped him. One of them fastened upon his horse,
and the other attacked the man with that violence,
that he had not time, or not presence of mind
enough, to draw his pistol, but hallooed and cried
out to us most lustily. My man Friday being next
to me, I bade him ride up, and see what was the
matter. As soon as Friday came in sight of the
man, he hallooed as loud as the other, ‘ O mas-
ter! Omaster!’ but, like a bold fellow, rode di-
rectly up to the man, and, with a pistol, shot the
wolf that attacked him into the head.
It was happy for the poor man that it was my
man Friday ; for he, having been used to that kind
of creature in his country, had no fear upon him,
but went close up to him, and shot him as above:
whereas any of us would have red at a farther
distance, and have, perhaps, either missed the wolf,
or endangered shooting the man.
But it was enough to have terried a bolder man
than I; and indeed it alarmed all our company,
when, with the noise of Friday’s pistol, we heard
on both sides the dismalest howling of wolves, and
the noise redoubled by the echo of the mountains,
that it was to us as if there had been a prodigious
multitude of them; and perhaps indeed there were
not such a few, as that we had no cause of appre-
hensions.
However, as Friday had killed this wolf, the
other, that had fastened upon the horse, left him
immediately, and ed, having happily fastened upon
his head, where the bosses of the bridle had stuck
in histeeth, so that he had not done him much
hurt. The man, indeed, was most hurt; for the
raging creature had bit him twice, once on the arm,
and the other time a little above his knee; and
he was just, as it were, tumbling down by the dis-
order of his horse, when Friday came up, and shot
the wolf.
It is easy to suppose, that at the noise of Friday's
pistol we all mended our pace, and rid up,‘as fast as
the way (which was very difcult) would give us
leave, to see what was the matter. As soon as we
came clear of the trees, which blinded us before,
we saw plainly what had been the case, and how
Friday had disengaged the poor guide; though we
did not presently discern what kind of creature it
was he had killed.
But never was a ght managed so hardily, and in
such a surprising manner, as that which followed
between Friday and the bear, which gave us all
(though at rst we were surprised and afraid for
him) the greatest diversion imaginable. As the
bear is a heavy, clumsy creature, and does not gal-
lop as the wolf does, which is swift and light; so
he has two particular qualities, which generally are
the rule of his actions. First, as to men, who are
not his proper prey, I say, not his proper prey, be-
cause, though I cannot say what excessive hunger
might do, which was now their case, the ground
being all covered with snow; yet, as to men, he
does not usually attempt them, unless they rst
attack him: on the contrary, if you meet him in
the woods, though if you do not meddle with him,
he will not meddle with you; yet then you must
take care to be very civil to him, and give him the
road; for he is a very nice gentleman", he will not
go a step out of his way for a prince; nay, if you
are really afraid, your best way is to look another
way, and keep going on; for sometimes if you stop
and stand still, and look steadfastly at him, he takes
it for an aifront; but if you throw or toss any
thing. at him, and it hits him, though it were but
a bit of stick, as big as your nger, he takes it for
an affront, and sets all other business aside to pur-
sue his revenge; for he will have satisfaction in
point of honour: and this is his rst quality. The
next is, that if he be once affronted, he will never
leaveyou, night or day, till he has his revenge,
but follow, at a good round rate, till he overtakes
you. -
My man Friday had delivered our guide, and
when we came up to him, he was helping him off
from his horse; -for the man was both hurt and
frighted, and indeed the last more than the rst‘;
when, on a sudden, we spied the bear come out of
the wood, and a vast monstrous one it was, the
biggest by far that ever I saw. We were all a little
surprisedlwhen we saw him; but when Friday saw
him, it was easy to see joy and courage in the fel-
low’s countenance. ‘ O! O! O !' says Friday, three
times, pointing to him; ‘ O master! you give me
te leave, me skakee te hand with him, me makee
you good laugh.’ _
I was surprised to see the fellow so pleased.
‘ You fool you,’ said I, ‘he will eat you up!’ ‘ Eatee
P
me up! Eaten me up!’ says Friday, twice over
again. ‘ Me eatee him up: me make you good
laugh. You all stay here: me show you good
laugh.’ So down he sits, and gets his boots oil‘ in
a moment, and put on a pair ofgumps (as we call
the at shoes they wear), and Wlllcll he had in his
pocket, gives my other servant his horse, and with
his gun, away he flew, swift like the wind.
The bear was walking softly 011, and offered to
meddle with nobody, till }"i'irluy, coming pretty
near, calls to him, as if the bear could understand
him, ‘ Hark ye, hark ye,’ says Friday, ‘ me speakee
wit you.’ We followed at a distance; for now
being come down to the Gascoigne side of the
mountains, we were entered a vast great forest,
where the country was plain, and pretty open,
though many trees in it scattered here and there.
I-‘riday, who had, as we say, the heels of the
bear, came up with him quickly, and takes up a
great stone, and throws it at him, and hit him just
on the head; but did him no more harm, than it
he had thrown it against a wall: but it answered
I"ri<lay’s end; for the rogue was so void of fear,
that he did it purely to make the bear follow him,
and ‘ show us some laugh,’ as he called it.
As soon as the bear felt the stone, and saw him,
he turns about, and comes after him, taking devil-
ish long strides, and slniffliiig along at a strange
rate, so as would put a horse to a middling gallop.
Away runs Friday, and takes his course, as if he
ran towards us for help; so we all resolved to re
nt once upon the bear, and deliver my man;
though I was angry at him heartily for bringing
the bear back upon us, when he was going about
his own business another way; and especially I
was angry that he had turned tho bear upon us,
and then run away; and I called out,-‘ You dog,’
said I, ‘ is this your making us lauggh? Come
away, and take your horse, that we may shoot the
creature.’ He hears me, and cries out, ' No shoot,
no shoot! Stand still: you get much laugh.’ And
as the nimble creature ran two feet for the beast’s
one, he turned, on a sudden, on one side ofus, and
seeing a great oak tree, t for his purpose, he
beckoned us to follow, and doubling his pace, he
gets niinbly up the tree, laying his gun down upon
the ground, at about live or six yards from the
bottom of the tree.
The bear soon came to the tree, and we followed
at a distance. The first thing he did, he stopped
at the gun, smelt to it, but let it lie, and up he
scrambles into the tree, climbing like a eat. though
so monstrously heavy. I. was amazed at the folly,
as I thought it, of my man, and could not for my
life see any thing to laugh at yet, till, seeing the
liear get up the tree, we all rode nearer to him.
When we came to the tree, there was Friday got
out to the small end of a large limb of the tree, and
the bear got about halfway to him : as soon as the
bear got out to that part where the limb of the tree
was weaker, ‘ Ha,’ says he, to us, ‘ now you see me
teachee the bear dance :’ so he falls a jumping, and
shaking the bough, at which the hear began to tot-
ter, but stood still, and began to look behind him,
to see how he should get back; then indeed we did
laugh heartily. But Friday had not done with him
by a great deal: when he sees him stand still, he
calls out to him again, as if he had supposed the
bear could speak English, ‘ What, you no come Far-
ther? Pray you come farther.’ So he left jumping‘
and shaking the bough; and the bear, just as it‘ he
had understood what he said, did come a little f'ar~
ther: then he fell a jumping again, and the bear
stopped again.
We thought now was a good time to knock him
on the head, and l called to I-‘riday to stand still,
and we would shoot the bear; but he cried out
earnestly, ‘ O pray ! O pray! no shoot! Me shoot
by and then.’ Ile would have said, ‘ By and by.’
However, to shorten the story, Friday danced so
much, and the bear stood so ticklish, that we had
laughing enough indeed, but still could not imagine
what the fellow would do; for rst we thought he
depended upon shaking the bearoff, and we found
the bear was too cunning for that too ; for he would
not go out far enough to be thrown down, but
clings fast with his great, broad claws and feet, so
that we could not imagine what would be the end of
it, and where the jest would be at last.
But Friday put us out of doubt quickly; for see-_
ing the bear cling fast to the bough, and that he
would not be persuaded to come any farther, ‘ Well,
well,’ said Friday, ‘ you no come farther, me go, me
go; you no come to me, me come to you.’ And
upon this, he goes out to the smallest end of -the
bough, where it should bend with his weight, and
and gently lets himself down by it, sliding down
the bough, -till he came near enough to jump dawn
on his feet, and away he ran to his gun, takes it up,
and stands still.
‘ Well,’ said I -tohim, ‘ Friday, what will you do
now? .Why don’t you shoot him?’ ‘ No shoot,’
says Friday, ‘ no yet, me shoot now, me no kill:
me stay, give you one more laugh.’ And indeed so
he did, as you will see presently; for when the bear
saw his enemy gone, he comes back from the bough
where he stood; but did it mighty leisurely, looking
behind him every step, and coming backward till he
got into the body of the tree. Then with the same
hinder end foremost, he came down the tree, grasp-
ing it with his claws, and moving one foot at a
time, very leisurely: at this juncture, and just be-
fore he could set his hind feet upon the ground,
Friday stepped close to him, clapped the muzzle of
his piece into his ear, and shot him dead as a
stone.
Then the -rogue turned about, to see if we did
not laugh; and when he saw we were pleased by
our looks, he falls a laughing himself very loud.
‘ Sojwe kill bear in my country,’ says Friday. ‘ So
you kill them !’ said I; ‘ why you have no guns.’
‘ No,’ says he: ‘ no ‘gun; but shoot great, much,
long arrow.’ ‘
This was, indeed, a good diversion to us ; but we
were still in a wild place, and our guide very much
hurt, and what to do we hardly knew: the howling
of wolves ran much in my head; and indeed, ex-
cept the noise I once heard on the shore of Africa,
of which I have said something already, I never
heard any thing that lled me with so much
horror.
' These things, and the approach of night, called
ns off, or else, as Ffid6=y'-iiLW—;Ot1ld have hadus, we
should certainly have taken the skin of this mon-
strous creature o’, whicli was worth saving; but
we had three leagues ‘t‘o go, and our guide hast~
ened us; so we left him, and went forward on our
journey.
‘ The ground was still covered with snow, though
not so deep and dangerous as on the mountains;
and the ravenous creatures, as\we heard after-
wards, were come down into the forest and plain
country, pressed by hunger, to seek for food; and
had done a great deal of mischief in the villages,
where they surprised the country people, killed a
great many of their sheep and horses, and some
people too.
We had one dangerous place to pass, of which
our guide told us, if there were any more wolves
in the country, we should nd them there; and
this was a small plain, surrounded with woods on
every side, and a long, narrow dele or lane, which
we were to pass, to get through the wood, and then
we should come to the village where we were to
lodge. -
It was within hall’ an hour of suh-set, when we
entered the rst wood; and a little after sun-set,
when we came into the plain. We met with nothing
in the rst wood, except that, in a little plain,
within the wood, which was not above two furlongs
over, we saw ve great wolves cross the road, full
speed, one after another, as if they had been in
chase of some prey, and had it in view. They
took no notice of us, and were gone, and out of our
sight in a few moments.
Upon this, our guide, who, by the way, was a
wretched faint-hearted fellow, bade us keep in a
ready posture; for be believed there were more
wolves a coming.
We kept our arms ready, and our eyes about us;
but we saw no more wolves till we came through
that wood, which was near half a league, and en-
tered the plain. As soon as we came into the plain,
we had occasion enough to look about us. The rst
object we met with, was a dead horse; that is to
say, a poor horse, which the wolves had killed,
and at least a dozen of them at work; we could
not say, eating of him, but picnking of his bones
rather; for they had eaten up all the esh before.
.We did not think t to disturb them at their
feast, neither did they take much notice of us.
Friday would have let y at them, but I would not
suffer him by any means ; for I found we were like
to have more business upon our hands than we were
aware of. We were not gone half over the plain,
but we began to hear the wolves howl, in the wood
on our left, in a frightful manner; and, pr,esently
after, we saw about a hundred coming on directly
towards us, all in a body, and most of them in a
line, as regularly as an army drawn up by ex-
perienced oicers. I scarce knew in what manner
to receive them ; but found to draw ourselves in a
close line, was the only way. So we formed in a
moment. But that we might not have too much
interval, I ordered that only every other man should
re, and that the others, who had» not red, should
stand ready to give them a second volley imme-
diately, if they continued to advance upon us; and
that then those who had red at rst should not
pretend to load their fusils again, but stand ready
’ .
with every one la pistol; fior we were all armed
with a fusil, and a pair of pistols, each man : so we
were, by this method, able to re six volleys, half
of us at a time. However, at present, we had no
necessity; for, upon ring the rst volley, the
enemy made a full stop, being terried as well with
the noise as with the re: four of them being shot
into the head, dropped; several others were wound-
ed, and went bleeding off, as we could see by the
snow. I found they stopped, but did not imme-
diately rctreat; whereupon remembering that I had
been told, that the ercest creatures were terried
at the voice of a man, I caused all our company
to halloo as loud as we could: and 1 found the
notion not altogether mistaken; for, upon our
shout, they began to retire, and turn about: then
I ordered a second volley to be red in their rear,
which put them to the gallop, and away they \vent
to the woods.
This gave us leisure to charge our pieces again,
and that we might lose no time, we kept doing; but
we had but little more than loaded our fusils, and
put ourselves into a readiness, when we heard a
terrible noise in the same wood on our left; only
that it was farther onward, the same way we were
to go.
The night was coming on, and the light began to
be dusky, which made it the worse on our side;
but the noise increasing, we could easily perceive
thht it was the howling and yelling of those hellish
creatures; and, on a sudden, we perceived two or
three troops of wolves, one on our left, one behind
us, and one on our front: so that we seemed to be
surrounded with them. However, as they did not
fall upon us, we kept our way forward, as fast we
could make our horses go, which, the way being
very rough, was only agood, large trot ; and in this
-manner we only came in view of the entrance of
the wood, through which we were to pass, at the
farther side of the plain ; but we were greatly sur-
prised, when, coming near the lane, or pass, we
saw a confused number of wolves standing just at
the entrance.
On a sudden, at another opening of the wood, we
heard the noise of a gun; and, looking that way,
out rushed a horse, with a saddle and a bridle on
him, ying like the wind, and sixteen or seventeen
wolves after him, full speed. Indeed, the horse
had the heels of them; but, as we supposed, that
he could not hold it at that rate, we doubted not
but they would get up with him at last; and no
question but they did. _. I
Here we had a most horrible sight; for-, riding
up to the entrance where the horse came out, we
found the carcase of another horse, and of two
men devoured by the ravenous creatures, and one
of the men was no doubt the same whom we heard
iire the gun; for there lay a gun just by him red
off; but, as to the man, his head, and the upper
part of his body, were eaten up.
This lled us with horror, and we knew not what
course to take ; but the creatures resolved us soon,
for they gathered about us presently, in hopes of
prey: and I verily believe there were three hun-
dred of them. It happened very much to our ad-
vantage, that at the entrance into the wood, but a
little way from it, there lay some large timber trees,
which had been cut down the summer before, and
I suppose lay there for carriage. I drew. my little
troop in among these trees, and placing ourselves
in a line, behind onelong tree, I advised them all
to alight, and, keeping that tree before us, for a
breastwork, to stand in a triangle or three fronts,
enclosing our horses in the centre.
Wedid so; and i-t was well we did, for never
was a more furious charge than the creatures made
upon us in this place: they came on us with a
growling kind of noise, and mounted the piece of
timber (which, as I said, was our breastwork), as if
they were only rushing upon their prey; and this
fury of theirs; it seems, was principally occasioned
by their seeing our horses behind us, which was
the prey they aimed at. I ordered our men to re
as before, every other man; and they took their
aim so sure, that indeed they killed several of the
wolves at the rst volley; but there was a neces-
sity to keep a continual ring, for they came on
like devils, those behind pushing on those before.
When we had red our second volley of our fu-
ails, we thought they stopped a little, and I hoped
they would have gone off, but it was but a moment,
for others came forward again; so we red two
volleys of our pistols, and I believe, in these four
rings, we killed seventeen or eighteen of them,
and lained twice as many: yet they came on
again.
I was loath to spend our last shot too hastily; so
I called my servant, not my man Friday, forhe was
better employed; for, with the greatest dexterity
imaginable, he charged my fusil, and his own,
while we were engaged ; but, as I said, I called my
other man; and giving him a horn of powder, I
bade him lay a train, all along the piece of timber,
and let it he a large train. I-Ie did so, and had
but just time to get away, when the wolves came
up to it, and some were got up upon it, when I,
snapping an uncharged pistol, close to the powder,
set it‘ on re. Those that were upon the timber
were scorched with it, and six or seven of them
fell, or rather jumped in among us, with the force
and fright of the lire. We dispatched these in an
instant, and the rest were so frighted with the
light, which the night, for now it was very near
dark, made more terrible, that they drew back a
little. y .
Upon which, T ordered our last pistols to be
red off in one volley, and after that we gave a
shout: upon this, the wolves turned tail, and we
sallied immediately upon near twenty lame ones,
which we found struggling on the ground, and fell

a cutting them with our swords, which answered
our expectation; for the crying and howling they
made were better understood by their fellows, so
that they all fled, and left us.
-We had, rst and last, killed about threescore of
them; and had it been daylight, we had killed
many more. The eld of battle being thus cleared,
we made forward again; for we had still near a
league to go. We heard the ravenous creatures
howl and yell in the woods as we went, several
times; and sometimes we fancied we saw some of
them, but the snow dazzling our eyes, we were not
certain: so in about an hour more, we came to the
town, where we were to lodge, which we found in
a terrible fright, and all in arms; for it seems,
that, the night before, the wolves and some bears,
had broken into the village, and put them in a
terrible fright; and they were obliged to keep
guard, night and day, but especially in the night,
to preserve their cattle, and indeed their people.
The next morning our guide was so ill, and his
limbs so swelled with the -rankling of his two
wounds, that he could go no farther; so we were
obliged to take a new guide there, and go to TIIO7
louse, where we found a warm climate, a fruitful,
pleasant country, and no snow, no wolves, or any
thing like them. But when we told our story at
Tholouse, they told us it was nothing but what was
ordinary in the great forest, at the foot of the
mountains, especially when the snow lay on the
gro_und._ But they inquired much what kind of a
guide we had gotten, that would venture to bring
us that way in such a severe season; and told us,
it was very much we were not all devoured. When
we told them how we placed ourselves‘, and the,
horses in the middle, they blamed us exceedingly,
and told us, itwas fty to one, but -we had been
all destroyed; for it was the sight of the horses
that made_the_wolves so furious, seeing their prey,
and that at other times they are really afraid of
a gun; but they being excessive hungry, and
raging on that account, the eagerness to come at
the horses had made them senseless of danger; and
that if we had not by the continued re, and at
last by the stratagem of the train of powder, ma-
stered them, it had been great odds but that we
had been torn to pieces; whereas had we been
content to have sat still on horseback, and red as
horsemen, they would not have taken the horses
so much for their own, when men were on their
backs, as otherwise; and,withal, they told us, that,
at last, if we had stood all together, and left our
horses, they would have been so eager to have de-
voured them, that we might have come off safe,
especially having our re-arms in our hands, and
being so many in number.
For my part, I was never so sensible of danger
in my life; for seeing above three hundred devils
come roaring and open-mouthed to devour us, and
having nothing to shelter us, or retreat to, I gave
myself over for lost; and, as it was, I believe, I
shall never care to cross those mountains again;
I think I would much rather go a thousand leagues
by sea, though I were sure to meet with a storm"
once a week.
' I have nothing uncommon to take notice of in
my passage through France; nothing but what
other travellers have given an account of, with
much more advantage than I can. I travelled from
Tholouse to Paris, and, without any considerable
stay, came to Calais, and landed safe at Dover, the
fourteenth of January, after having had a severe
cold season to travel in. _ l
‘ I was now come to the centre of my travels, and
had, in a little time, all my new-discovered estate
safe about me; the bills of exchange which I
brought with me having been very currently paid.
My principal guide, and privy-counsellor, was my
good, ancient widow, who, in gratitude for the
money I had senther, thought no pains too much.
or care too great, to employ for me; and I trusted
her so entirely with every thing, that I was per-
fectly easy as to the security of my e’ects: and
indeed I was very happy from my beginning, and
now to the end, in the unspotted integrity of this
good gentlewoman.
And now I began to think of leaving my effects
with this woman, and setting out for Lisbon, and so
to the Brasils. But now another scruple came in
my way, and that was religion; for as I had enter-
tained some doubts about the Roman religion, even
while I was abroad, especially in my state of soli-
tude: so I knew there was no going to the Brasils
for me, much less going to settle there, unless I
resolved to embrace the Roman catholic religion,
without any reserve; except, on the other hand,
I resolved to be a sacrice to my principles, be a
martyr for religion, and die in the Inquisition : so I
resolved to stay at home, and, if I could nd means
for it, to dispose of my plantation.
To this purpose I wrote’ to my old friend at
Lisbon, who, in return, gave me notice, that lie
could easily dispose of it there; but that, if I
thought t to give him leave to offer it in my name
to the two merchants, the survivors of my trns~
tees, who lived in the Brasils, who must fully un-
derstand the value of it, who lived just upon the
spot, and whom I knew to be very rich, so that he
believed they would be fond of buying it; he did
not doubt, but I should make four or ve thousand
pieces of eight the more of it.
Accordingly I agreed, gave him order to oifer it
to them, and he did so ; and in about eight months
more, the ship being then returned, he sent me an
account, that they had accepted the offer, and had
remitted thirty-three" thousand pieces of eight to a
correspondent of theirs at Lisbon, to pay for it.
In return, I signed the instrument of sale in the
form which they sent from Lisbon, and sent it to
my old man, who sent me bills of exchange for
thirty-two thousand eight hundred pieces of eight,
for the estate, reserving the payment of one hun-
dred moidores a year to him, the old man, during
his life, and fty moidores afterward to his son for
his life, which I had promised them ; and which the
plantation was to make good as a rent-charge.
And thus I have given the rst part of a life of
fortune and adventure, a life of Providence’s check-
er-work, and of a variety which the world will sel-
dom be able to show the like of. Beginning fool-
ishly, but closing much more happily than any part
of it ever gave me leave so much as to hope for.
Any one would think, that, in this state of com-
plicated good fortune, I'was past running any more
hazards; and so indeed I had been, if other cir-
cumstances had concurred: but I was inured to a.
wandering life, had no family, nor many relations,
nor, however rich, had I contracted much acquaint-
ance; and though I had sold my estate in the
Brasils, yet I could not keep that country out of
my head, and had a great mind to be upon the
wing again; especially I could not resist the strong
inclination I had to see my island, and to know if
the poor Spaniards were in being there, and how the
rogues I left there had used them.
My true friend, the widow, earnestly dissuaded
me from it, and so far prevailed with me, that for
almost seven years she prevented my running
abroad: during which time I took my two nephews,
the children of one of my brothers, into my care.
The eldest having something of his own, I bred up
as a gentleman, and gave him a settlement of some
addition to his estate after my disease; the other
I put out to a captain of a ship: and after ve
years, nding him a sensible, bold, enterprising young
fellow, I put him into a good ship, and sent him
to sea. And this young fellow afterwards drew me
in, as old as I was, to farther adventures myself.
In the mean time, I in part settled myself here;
for rst of all I married, and that not either to my
disadvantage or dissatisfaction; and had three
children, two sons and one daughter. But my
wife dying, and my nephew coming home, with
good success, from a voyage to Spain, my inclina-
tion to go abroad, and his importunity, prevailed,
and engaged me to go in his ship as a private trader
tq the East Indies. This was in the year 1694.
In this voyage, I visited my new colony in the
island, saw'my successors, the ‘Spaniards, had the
"whole story of their lives, and of the villains I left
there, how at rst they insulted the poor Spaniards,
how they afterwards agreed, disagreed, united, se-
parated, and how at last the Spaniards were obliged
to use violence with them ;'how they were subject,-
ed to the Spaniards; how honestly the Spaniards
used them; a history,'if it were entered into, as
full of variety and wonderful accidents, as my own
part: particularly also as to theirebattles with the
Caribbeans, who landed several times upon the
island, and as to the improvement they made upon
the island itself; and how ve of them made an
attempt upon the main land, and brought away
eleven men and ve women prisoners, by which, at
my coming, I found about twenty young children
on the island.
Here I staid about twenty days, left them supplies
of all necessary things, and particularly of arms,
powder, shot, clothes, tools, and two workmen,
which I brought from England with me; viz. a
carpenter and a smith.
' Besides this, I shared the island into parts with
them, reserved to myself the property of the whole,
but gave them such parts respectively as they agreed
on; and having settled all things with them, and
engaged them not to leave the place, I left them
there.
From thence I touched at the Brasils, from
whence I sent a bark,‘which I bought there, with
more people, to the island ; and in it, besides other
supplies, I sent seven women, being such as I
$5’
~4
found proper for service, or for wives to such as
would take them. As to.the Englishmen, I pro-
mised them to send them some women from Eng-
land, with a good cargo of necessaries, if they
would apply themselves to planting, which I after-
wards could not perform. The fellows proved
very honest and diligent, after they were mastered,
and had their properties set apart for them. I sent
them also from the Brasils ve cows, three of them
being big with calf, some sheep, and some hogs,
which, when I came again, were considerably in-
creased. ' _
But all these things, with an account how three
hundred Caribbees came and invaded them, and
ruined their plantations, and how they fought with
that whole number twice, and were at rst defeat-
ed, and one of them killed; but at last a storm de-
stroying their enemies canoes, they famished or
destroyed almost all the rest, and renewed and re-
covered the possession of their plantation, and still
ived upon the island: I
All these things, with some very surprising inci-
dents, in some new adventures of my own, for ten
years more, I may, perhaps, give a farther account
of hereafter.
TI-IE
‘FARTI-IER ADVENTURES
OF
‘ROBINSON CRUSOE.
‘\
TI~IAT homely proverb, used on so many ocea-
sions in England, viz. that ‘ What is bred in
the bone will not go out of the esh,’ was never
more veried than in the story of my life. Any one
would think, that, after thirty-ve years’ aiictiou,
and a variety of unhappy circumstances, which few
men, if any, ever went through before, and after
near seven years of peace and enjoyment in the
fnlness of all things; grown old, and when, if
ever, it might be allowed me to have had experi-
ence of every state of middle life, and to know
which was most adapted to make a man completely
happy; I say, after all this, any one would have
thought that the native propensity to rambling,
which I gave an account of, in my rst setting out
into the world, to have been so predominant in my
thoughts, should be worn out, the volatile part be
fully evacuated, or at least condensed, and Imight
at sixty-one years of agehave been a little inclined
to stay at home, and have done venturing life and
fortune any more.
Nay, fiuther, the common motive of foreign ad-
ventures was taken away in me; for I had no for»
tune to make, I had nothing to seek. If I had
gained ten thousand pounds, I had been no richer;
for I had already suicient for me, and for those I
had to leave it to: and that I had was visibly in-
creasing; for having no great family, I could not
spend the income of what I had, unless I would
set up for an expensive way of living, such as a
great family, servants, equipage, gaiety, and the
like, which were things I had no notion of, nor in-
clination to ; so that I had nothing indeed to do,
but to sit still, and fully enjoy what I had got, and
see it increase daily upon my hands.
Yet all these things had no effect upon me, or at
least not enough to resist the strong inclination I
had to go abroad again, which hung about me like
a chronical distemper; particularly the desire of
seeing my new plantation in the island, and the
colony I left there, run in my head continually. I
dreamed of it all night, and my imagination ran
upon it all day; it was uppermost in all my
thoughts, and my fancy worked so steadily and
strongly upon it, that I talked of it in my sleep.
In short, nothing could remove it out of my mind:
it even broke so violently into all my discourses,
that it made my conversation tiresome, for I could
talk of nothing else; all my discourse ran into it,
even to impertinence; and I saw it myself.
I have often heard persons of good judgement
say, that all the stir people make in the world about
ghosts and apparitions, is owing to the strength of
imagination, and the powerful operation of fancy
in their minds: that there is no such thing as a
spirit appearing, or a ghost walking, and the like:
that people’s poring affectionately upon the past
conversation of their deceased friends, so realizes
it to them, that they are capable of fancying, upon
some extraordinary circumstances, that they see
them, talk to them, and are answered by them,
when in truth, there is nothing but shadow and
vapour in the thing, and they really know nothing"
of the matter.
»
For my part, I know not to this hour, whether
there are any such things as real apparitions, spec-
tres, or walking of people after they are dead; or
whether there is any thing in the stories they tell
us of that kind, more than the product of va-
pours, sick minds, and wandering fancies ; but this
I know, that my imagination worked up to such a
height, and brought me into such excess of vapours,
or what else I may call it, that I actually supposed
myself oftentimes updn the spot, at my old castle
behind the trees; saw my old Spaniard, Friday’s
father, and the reprobate sailors, whom I left upon
the island; nay, I fancied I talked with them, and
looked at them so steadily, though I was broad
awake, as at persons just before me; and this I
did, till I often frighted myself with the images my
fancy represented to me. One time in my sleep I
had the villany of the three pirate sailors so lively
related to me, by the rst Spaniard, and Friday's
father, that it was surprisi-ngzithey told me how
they barbarously attempted to murder all the Spa-
niards, and that they set re to the provisions they
had_laid up, on purpose to distress and starve
them: things that I had never heard of, and that in-
deed were never all of them true in fact. And it was
so warm in my imagination, and so realized to me,
that, to the hour I saw them, I could not be per-
suaded, but that it was, or would be true; also how
I resented it, when the Spaniards complained to
me ; and how I brought them to justice, tried them
before me, and ordered them all three to be hanged.
What there was really in this, shall be seen in its
place; for, however I came to form such things in
my dream, and what. secret converse of spirits in-
jected it, yet there was, I say, very much of it
true. I own, that this dream had nothing in it
literally and specically true; but the general part
was so true, the base and villanous behaviour of
these three hardened rogues was such, and had
been so much worse than all I can describe, that
the dream had too much similitude of the fact;
and as I would afterwards have punished them se-
verely, so if 1 had hanged them all,-I had been
much in the right, and should have been justified
‘both by the laws of God and man.
But to return to my story: in this kind of tem-
per I had lived some years. I had no enjoyment
of my life, no pleasant hours, no agreeable diver-
sion, but what had something or other of this in it;
so that my wife, who saw my mind so wholly bent
upon it, told me very seriously one night. that she
believed there was some secret, powerful impulse
of I’rovidc.nc.e upon me, which had determined me
to go thither again; and that she Found nothing
hindered my going, but my being engaged to a
wife and children. She told me, that it was true,
she could not think of parting with me; but as she
was assured, that it‘ she was dead, it would be the
rst thing I would do; so, as it seemed to her, that
the thing was determined above, she would not be
the only obstruction. For if I thought t, and rc-
solved to go........I-Iere she found me very intent
upon her words, and that I looked very earnestly
at her; so that it a little disordered her, and she
stopped. I asked her why she did not go on, and
say out what she was going to say. But I per-
ceived her heart was too full, and some tears stood
in her eyes. ‘ Speak out, my dear,’ said I. ‘ Are
you willing I should go?’ ‘ No,’ says she, very
affectionately: ‘ I am far from willing. But if you
are resolved to go,’ says she, ‘ and rather than I
will be the only hindrance, I will go with you;
for though I think it a preposterous thing for one
of your years, and in your condition, yet if it
must he,’ said she again, weeping, ‘ I won’t leave
yon; for if it be of Heaven, you must do it, there
is no resisting it; and‘ if Heaven makes it your
duty to go, he will also make it mine to go with
you, or otherwise dispose of me, that I may not
obstruct it.‘
'1his aiTectionate behaviour of my wife brought
‘me a little out of the vapours, and I began to con-
sider what I was a doing. I corrected my wander-
ing fancy, and began to argue with mysclfsedately,
what business I had, after threcscore years, and
after such a life of tedious sufferings and disasters,
and closed in so happy and easy a manner; I say,
what business had I to rush into new hazards, and
put myself upon adventures,‘ t only for youth and
poverty to run into?
With those thoughts, I considered my new en-
gagements, that I had a wife, one child born, and
my wife then great with child of another; that I
had all the world could give mo, and had no need
‘to seek hazards for gain; that I was declining in
years, and ought to think rather of leaving what I
had gained, than of seeking to increase it; that as
to what my wife had said, ,of its being an impulse
from Heaven, and that it should be my duty to go,
I had no notion of that; so after many of these
cogitations, I struggled with the power of my ima-
gination, reasoned myself out of it, as I believe
people may always do in like cases, if they will;
and, in a word, I conquered it; composed myself
with such arguments as ‘occurred to my thoughts,
and which my present condition furnished me plen~
tifully with ; and particularly, as the most cilcctual
method, I resolved to divert ‘myself with other
things, and to engage in some business that might
effectually tie me up from any more excursions of
this ‘kind ; for I found the thing returned upon
me, chiey when I was idle, had nothing to do, nor
any thing of moment immediately before me.
To this purpose, I bought a little farm in the
county of Bedford, and resolved to remove myself
thither. Ihad a little convenient house upon it,
and the land about it I found was capable of gri-.at
improvement, and that it was many ways suited to
my inclination, which delighted in cultivating, ma-
naging, planting, and improving of land; and par-
ticularly, being an inland country, I was removed
from conversing among ships, sailors, and things
relating to the remote parts of the world.
~ In a word, I went down to my farm, settled my
family, bought me ploughs, harrows, a cart, waggon,
horses, cows, sheep; and, setting seriously to work,
became, in one half-year, a more country gentle-
man. My thoughts were entirely taken up in ma-
naging my servants, cultivating the ground, enclos-
ing, planting, &c.; and I lived, as I thought, the
most agreeable life that nature was capable of di-
recting, or that a man always bred to misfortunes
was capable of being retreated to.
I farmed upon my own land; Ihad no rent to
pay; was limite_d by no articles. I could pull up,
or cut down, as I pleased. What I planted was for
myself; and what I improved was for my family;
and having thus left off the thoughts of wandering,
I had, not the least ‘discomfort in any part of my
life, as to this world. Now l thought indeed, that
I enjoyed that middle state of life, which my father
so earnestly recommended to me; and lived a kind
of heavenly life, something like what is described
by the poet upon the subject of a country life:
Free from vices, free from care;
Age has no pain, and youth no snare.
But ‘in the middle of all this felicity, one blow
from unseen Providence unhingecl me at once; and
not only made a breach upon me inevitable and
incurable, but drove me, by its consequence, into
a deep relapse of the wandering disposition, which,
as. I, may say, being born in my very blood,
soon recovered its hold of me; and, l.ike the returns
of a violent distemper, came on with an irresistible
force upon me, so that nothing could make any
more impression upon me. This blow was the loss
of my wife. i p
It is not my bnsinesp here to write an elegy upon
my wife, to give a character of her particular vir-
tues, and make my court to the sex by the attery
of a funeral sermon. She was, in a few words, the
stay of all my affairs, the centre of all my enter-
prises; the engine, that by her prudence reduced
me to that happy compass I was in, from the most
extravagant and ruinous project that uttered in
my head, as above; and did more to guide my»
rambling genius, than a mother’s tears, a father's
instructions, a friend's counsel, or all my own rea-
soning powers, could do. I was happy in listening
to her entreaties, and in being moved by her tears,
and to the last degree desolate and dislocated gin
the world by the loss of her. _
When she was gone, the world looked awkwardly
round me: I was as much a stranger in it, in my
thoughts, as I was in the Brasils, when I rst went
on sh-ore there; and as much alone, except as to
the assistance of servants, as I was in my island.
I knew neither what to do, or what not to do. I
saw the world busy round me, one part labouring
for bread, and the other squandering it in vile
excesses, or empty pleasures; equally miserable,
because the end they proposed still ed from them;
for the men of pleasure every day surfeited of their
vice, and heaped up work for son ow and repent-
ance: and the men of labour spent their strength
in daily strugglings for bread, to maintain the vital
strength they laboured with; so living in a daily
circulation of sorrow, living but to work, and
working but to live, as if daily bread were the only
end of a wearisome life, and a wcarisome life the
only occasion of daily bread.
This put me in mind of the life I lived in my
kingdom, the island; where I suffered no more
corn to grow, because I did not want it; and bred
no more goats, because I had no more use for them:
where the money lay in the drawer till it grew
mouldy, and had scarce the favour to be looked
upon in twenty years.

I was twenLy-six days a making me 2» cI'e_,ul'beard.
It was now the beginning of the year 1093, nvhen
my nephew, whom, as I have observed before, I had
brought up to the sea, and had made him com-
mander of a ship, was come home from a short
voyage to Bilboa, being the rst he had made. I'Ie
(.'£\ll1Q to me, and told me, that some nierclmnts of
his acquailmmco had been proposing to him to go
a voyage for tham to the East Indies and to China,
asprivato traders. ‘ Add now, uncle,’ says he, ‘ it‘
you ‘will go no son. with me, Pl! engage to land
yon upon your OM hahilmtiau in the island ; for we
are to tend: at the Emails.’
Nothing om lie a gceaeor demonstration of 21.

world, than tho conourreuee of second causes with
the idem of things whioh we form in our minds
porfeobly reserved, and not communicated to any in
the world.
My. nephow "knew nothing how far my distempor
of wotuiering woe retmunml upon me, and I knew
nothing of what he had in his thoughts to s'ay,
when that vary morning before he came to me, I
had, in a great deal of confusion of thought, and
rovolving every part of my circumstances in my
mind, come to this resolution; viz. that I would go
.to Lisbon, and consult with my old sea captain,
and so, if it was rational and practicable, 1 would
go and see the island a»gaiu,1:mcl seo what was_be-
come of my people there. I had pleased’ myself
also with Lho thoughts of peopling the place, and
carrying inlmbitants from hence, getting a patent
for the possession, and I know not what; when, in
the middle of all this, in comes my nephew, as I
have said, with his project of carrying me thither,
in his way to the East Indies.
- I paused a while at his words, and looking steadily
at him, ‘ What devil,’ said I, ‘ sent you of this un~
lucky errand?’ My nephew startled, as if he had
been frighted at rst; but perceiving? I was not
-much displeased with the proposal, he recovered
himself. ‘ I hope it may not be an unlucky pm.
posal, sir,’ says he: ‘ I dare say, you would be
pleased to see your new colony there, where you
once reigned with more felicity than most of your
brothor monarchs in the world.’
In :1 word, the schome hit so exactly with my

my old habitation.
As soon as I saw the place, I called for Friday,
and asked him, if he knew where he was. Ilo
looked about a little, and presently, clapping his
hands, cried, i O yes! O there! O yes! O there!’
pointing to our old llElbl128.i.l0l], and fell a dancing
and capering like a mad fellow; and I had much
ado to keep him from jumping into the sea, to swim
ashore to the place.
‘ Well, Friday,’ said I, ‘ do you think we shall
nd any body here or no? And- what do you
thi-nlc, shall we ace your father?’ The fellow stood
mute as a stock a- good while; but when I named
his father, the poor affectionate creature looked
dejected; and I-could see the tears run down his
face very plexitifnlljn ‘ What is’ the matter, Fri-
day?’ said I. ' Are you troubled because you may
see your father?’ ‘ No, no,‘ says ho, shaking his
head, ‘ no see him more ; no, ever more sec again 2’
‘Why so,’ said I, ‘ Friday? how do you know
that?’ ‘ 0 no, no,’ says Friday; ‘ he long ago die:
long ago; he much old man.’ ‘ Well, well,’ said I,
‘1-‘riday, you don’t know. Bub shall we see any
one else then?’ The follow, it seems, had better

Friday in‘*thc boat; -for the affectionate creature
had spied his fa‘ther at a» distance, :1 good way off
of the Spaniards; ‘where indeed I saw nothing of
him; and if they had‘not let lnm go on shore, he
would have jumped into the sea. He was no

like an arrow out of a bow. It would have made
R
any man shed tears, in spite of the rrnest rcsolui
tion, to have seen the rst transports» of this poor
fellow’s joy when he came to his father: how he
embraced him,~kissed him, stroked his face, took
him up in his arms, set him down upon a tree, and
lay down by him; then stood and looked at him,
as any one would look at-a strange picture, for a
quarter of an hour -together; then lay down upon
the ground, and stroked his legs, and kissed them,
and then got up again, and stared at him: one
\'vould~ have thought the fellow bewitched. But it
would have made a dogelaugh to see how the next
day his passion ran out another way. In the morn-
ing; he walked along the shore, to and again, with
his father, several hours, always leading him by the
hand, as if he had been a lady; and every now
‘and then- would come to-V fetch something or other
for him' to the boat, eitheria lump of sugar, or_ a‘
dram, a biscuit, or something or other that was
good. In the afternoon, his frolics ran another
way, for then he would set the old man down upon‘
the groui1d,_and dance about him, and make a
thousand antic postures and gestures; and all the
while he did this, he would be talking to him, and
telling him one story oranother of his travels, and
of what had happened to him abroad, to divert him;
ln short, if the same lial aliection was to be found
in Christians to their parents in" our parts of the‘
world, one would be tempted to say, there hardly
would have been any no-ed of the fth command-
lhent. .~ . : ~ i
Y But this is a digression :- I return to my landing.-
lt would be endless to take notice of all. the cere-'
monies and civilities that the Spaniards received me
with. The rst Spaniard, whom, as I said, I knew
very well, was he whose life I had saved: he came
towards the boat, attended by" one more, carrying; a
ag of truce also; and he did not only not know"
me at rst, but he had no thoughts, no notion, of
its being metliat-was c01ne,- till 1- spoke to ‘him:
" Seignior,’ said I, in Portuguese, ‘ do you not know
rne?’ Atwhich he spoke not a word; but giving
his musket to the man that was with him, threw his
arms abroad, and, saying something in Spanish that
I did not perfectly hear, came forward, and emi
braced‘ me, tellingime he was inexcusable not to-
know that face again, that he had" once seen, as of_
an angel" from heaven sent to save his life. He
said abundance of very handsome things, as a well-
bred Spaniard always knows-how; and then beck-
oning to the person that attended him, bade him
go and call out his“ comrades. He then asked me,
if I would walk to myiold habitation, where he
would give me possession of my own house again,
and where I should see there had been but mean-
improvements. So I walked along with him; but,-
alas! I could no more-nd "the placeagain, than
if 1 hadnever been there : for they had planted so-
inmiy trees, and placed them in such a posture, so
thick? and close to one another, "<\nd'in- ten years’
time they were grown so big‘, that, in short, the
place was inaccessible; -except by such windings,
and blind ways, as they themsel\_'cs~ only who made
them could nd. ' ' ' '
" 1 asked them, what put them upon all these for-n
tications. I-Ie told me, 1- would say there was
need enough of" it, when they had given me an
account how they had passed their time since their
arriving in the island, especially after they had the
misfortune to nd I was gone. Ile told me, he
‘could not but have some satisfaction ‘in my good‘
fortune, when he heard that "I was gone in a good
ship, and to my satisfaction; and that he had
oftentimes a strong persuasion, that one time or
other he" should see me again. But ‘nothing~ that
ever befel him in his life, he said, was so surprising
and afictingto him at rst, as the -disappointment
he was-under when he came back to the island, and
found I was not there. V ’ * ' '
"’ Asitolhe three barbarians“(so"he called them)
that were left behind, and of whom he said he had
a long story to tell me, the Spaniards all thought
themselves much better among. the savages, only
that their number was so small. ‘And,’ saysjhe,
F had they been strong enough, we had been all
long ago in purgatory ;’ and with that he crossed
himself upon the breast. ‘ But, sir,’ says he, ‘ I
hope you willnot be displeased, when I shall tell
you how, forced by necessity, we were obliged, for
Our own preservation, to disarm them, and make
them our subjects, who would not be content with
being moderately our masters, but would be our
murderers. I answered, I was heartily afraid of it
when I left them there ; and nothing troubled me
at my parting from the island, but that they were
not come back, that I might have put them in pos-
session of every thing rst, and ‘left the other in a
state of subjection, as they deserved. But if they
had reduced them to it, I was very glad, and should
be very far from nding any fault with it; for
I knew they were a parcel of refractory, ungo-
vernable villains‘, and were t for any manner of
mischief.
While I was saying this, came the man whom he
had sent back, and with him eleven men more. In
the dress they were in, it was impossible to guess
what nation they were of ; but he made all clear
both to them and to me. First, he turned to me,
and, pointing to them, said, ‘ These, sir, are some of
the gentlemen who owe their lives to you ;’ and
then turning to them, and pointing to me, he let
them know who 1 was. Upon which, they all
came up, one by one, not as if they had been
sailors, and ordinary fellows, and I the like, but
really as if they had been ambassadors of noble-
men, and I a monarch, or a great conqueror. Their
behaviour w-as, to the last degree, obliging and
courteous, and yet mixed with a manly, majestic
gravity which very well became them; and, in
short, they had so much more manners than I, that
ca
Oi
U:
I scarce knew how to receive their civilities, much
less how to return them in kind.
The history of their coming to, and conduct in,
the island, after my going away, is so remarkable,
and has so many incidents, which the former part
of my relation will help to understand, and which
will, in most of the particulars, refer to that ac-
count I have already given, that I cannot but com-
mit them with great delight to the reading of those
that come after me.
I shall no longer trouble the story with a rela-
tion in the rst person, which will put me to the
expense of ten thousand ‘ said I’s,’ and ‘ said he‘s,’
and ‘he told me’s,’ and ‘ I told him’s,‘. and the like ;
but Ishall collect the facts historically, as near as
I can gather them out of my memory, from what
they related to me, and from what 1 met with in
my conversing with them, and with the place.
In order to do this succinctly, and as intelligi-
bly as I can, 1 must go back to the circumstance in
which I left the island, and which the persons
were in, of whom I am to speak. And rst, it is
necessary to repeat, that I had sent away Friday's
father and the Spaniard, the two whose lives I had
rescued from the savages; I say, I had sent them
away, in a large canoe, to the main, as I then
thought it, to fetch over the Spaniard’s companions
whom he had left behind him, in order to save
them from the like calamity that he had been in ;
and in order to succour them for the present, and
that, if possible, we might together nd some way
for our deliverance afterward. \
When I sent them away, I had no visible appear-
ance of, or the least room to hope for, my own de-
liverance any more than I had twenty years before;
much less had I any foreknowledge of what after
happcned, I mean of an English ship coming on
shore there to fetch me off;'and it could not but
be a very great surprise to them, when they came
back, not only to nd that I was gone, but to nd
three strangers left on the spot, possessed of alllthal:
I had left behind me, which would otherwise have
_been their own. A ~ A
. The rst thing,’ however, which I inquired into,
that I might begin where I left o‘, was of their
_,own part; Vandl desired he would give me a par,-
,ticu_lar account of his voyage back to his c_ountry,-
men with the boat, when I sent him to fetch them
~._over. He told me there was little variety in that
part; for nothing remarkable' happened to them on
,the way, they having very calm weather, and a
smooth sea. For his countrymen, it could not be
‘doubted, heysaid, but that they were overjoyed to
see him: (It seems, he was the principal man
aniong them, the ‘captain of the vessel they had
been shipwrecked in, havingheen dead some time.)
‘The-y were, he said, the more surprised to see him,
because they knewthat he was fallen into the hands
of savages. who, they were satised, would devour
him, as they did all the rest of their prisoners:
-that when he told them the story of his deliver-
ance, and in what manner he was furnished for car-
rying them away, it was like a dreamyto thenf; and
their astonishment, they said, was something like
that ofJoseph‘s brethren, when he told them who
he was, and told them the story of his exaltation
in Pharaoh’s court. But when he showed them the
arms, the powder, the ball,_and the provisions, that
he brought them for their journey, or voyage,
they were restored to themselves, took a just share
.of the joy of their deliverance, and immediately
prepared to come away with him.
_ Their rst business was to get canoes; and in
this they were obliged not to _stiek so much upon
the honest part of it, but to trespass upon their
friendly savages. and to borrow two large canoes,
or periaguas, on pretence of going out a lisliirfg, or
for pleasure. . ~
In these they came away the next morning. It
seems they wanted no time toyget themselves ready;
for they had no- baggage, I10ltl1(2I‘»Cl0i.l"l€S, nor pro’-
visions, nor any thing in the world, but what they
had on them, and a few roots to eat, of which they
used to make their bread.
They were in all three weeks absent, and in that
time, unluckily for them, l had the occasion offered
for my escape, as I mentioned in my other part;
and to get oil" from the island, leaving three of the
most impudent, hardened, ungovernod, disagreeable
yillains behind me, that any man could desire to
meet with; to the poor Spaniards’ great grief’ and
_disappointment, you may be sure.
'1'he'only just thingtlie rogues did, was, that
when the Spaniards came on shore they gave my
letter to them, and gave them provisions, rand
other relief, as I had ordered them to do. Also
they gave them the long paper of directions, which
I had left with them, containing the particular
methods which I took for managing every part of
my life there, the way how I baked my bread, bred
up my tame goats, and planted my corn‘; how I
cured my grapes, made my pots, and, in a word,
every thing 1 did. “All this being-written do\vn,
they gave to the Spaniards, two of whom under-
stood English well enough. Nor did they refuse to
accommodate-the Spaniards with any thing else,
for they agreed very well for some time: they gavel
them an equal admission into the house, or cave,
and they began to live very sociably; and the
head Spaniard, who had seen pretty much of my
methods, and Friday's father together, managed all
their .a°airs; for, as for the Englishmen, they did
nothing but ramble about the island, shoot parrots,
and catch tortoises; and when they came home at
night, -the ‘Spaniards provided their suppers for
them. -
The Spaniards would have been satised with
this, would the other -but have let them alone‘,
which, however, they could not nd in their hearts
to do long: but, like the dog in the manger, they
would not eat themselves, and would not let others
eat neither. The differences, nevertheless, were at
rst but trivial, and such as are not worth relat-
ing; but at last it broke out into open war, and it
began with all the rudeness and insolence that can
be imagined, without reason, without provocation,
contraryito nature, and, indeed, to common sense ;
and though it is true, the rst relation of it came
from the Spaniards themselves, whom I may call the
accusers, yet when I came to examine the fellows
they could not deny a word of it.
But before I come to the particulars of this part,
I must supply a defect in my former relation; and
this was, that I forgot to set down among the rest,
that, just as we were weighing the anchor to set
sail, there happened a little quarrel on board our
ship, which I was afraid once would turn to a
second mutiny; nor was it appeased, till the cap-
tain, rousing up his courage, and taking us all to
his assistance, parted them by force, and making
two of .he most refractory fellows prisoners, he
laid them in irons; and as they had been active
in the former disorders, and let fall some ugly,
dangerous words the second time, he threatened
to carry them in irons to England, and have them
hanged there for mutiny and running away with
the ship.
_ This. it seems, though the captain did not intend
to do it, frighted some other men in the ship ; and
some of them had put it into the heads of the rest,
that the captain only gave them good words for the
present, till they should come to some English
port; and that then they should be all put into a
gaol, and tried for their lives.
The mate got intelligence of this, and acquainted
us with it; upon which it was desired, that I, who
still passed for a great man among them, should go
down with the mate, and satisfy the men, and tell
them, that they might he assured, ii’ they behaved

iienmson cmrson’. sag
the time past; sh'oul’d' be‘ pardoned'.' So I went,
and‘, after passing tiny 'h’onour"s’ word to them,
they appeared easy, and the more so, when I caused
the two men, ‘who were in irons, to be released and
forgiven. "
‘But this mutiny had brought us to an anchor
for that night, the wind also falling calm. Next
morning we found that our two men, Wll0"ll2l(l been
laid in irons, had stole each of them a musket,
and some other weapons; what powder or shot
they had, we know not; and had taken the ship’s
pinnace, which was not yet hauled up, and run
away with her to their companions in roguery on
shore. - '
I As soon as we found this, I ordered the long-
boat on shore, with twelve men and the mate, and
away they went to seek the rogues; but they could
neither nd them, nor any of the rest, for they all
ed into the woods, when they saw the boat coming
on shore. The mate was once resolved, in justice
to their roguery, to have destroyed their planta-
tions, burnt all their household stuff and furniture,
and left them to shift without it; but having no
order, he let all alone, left every thing as he found
it, and, bringing the‘ pinnace away, came on board
without them. -
» These two men made’ their number five ;_ but
the‘ other three villains were so much wickcdur than
these, that, after they. had been two or three days
together, they turned their. two new-comers out
of doors to shift For themselves, and would have
‘nothing to do with them, nor could they, fora
good while, be persuaded» to give them any foods:
as for the Spaniards, they were not yet come.
‘ When the Spaniards came rst on shore, the busi-
-ness began to go forward: the Spaniards would
-have persuaded the three English brutcs to have,
‘taken in their two countrymen again, that, as they
‘said, they might be all one family’; but they ‘would
not hear of it. So the two poor fellows livcd by
R 2
themselves, and, nding nothingbut industry and
_&t}Ypii(2ttl2l01I would make themalive comfortably, they
pitched their tents on the north shore of the island,
but a little more to the west, to be out of the dan.‘
ger of the savages, who alwayslandedon the east
parts of the island. »
Here they built them two huts ; one to lodge in,
and the other to lay up their magazines and stores
in: and the Spaniards having given them some corn
for seed, and especially some of the pease which I
had left them, they dug and planted, and enclosed,
after the pattern I had set for them all, and began
to live pretty well. Their rst crop of corn was
on the ground, and though it was but a little bit
of land which they had dug up at rst, having had
but a little time, yet it was enough to relieve them,
and nd them with bread, and other eatables ; and
one of the fellows, being the cook’s mate of the
ship, was very ready at making soup, puddings,
and such other preparations as the rice, and the
milk, and such little esh as they got, furnished
him to do.
They were going on in this little thriving pos.
ture, when the three unnatural rogues, their own
countrymen too, in mere humour, and to insult
them, came and bullied them, and told them the
island was theirs; that the governor, meaning me,
had given them possession of it, and nobody else
had any right to it; and d---n them, they should
build no houses upon their ground, unless they
would pay "them rent for them.
The two men thought they had jested at rst, and
asked them to come and sit down, _aud see what
ne houses they were that they had built, and tell
them what rent they demanded. And one of them
merrily told them, if they were ground landlords,
he hoped, if they built tenements upon the land,
and made improvements, they would, according to
the custom of all landlords, grant them a long
-lease; and bade them go fetch 8- scrivener to draw
O9
-l
I4
the writings. One of the three, d--ning and rag-
ing, told them, they should see they were not in
jest; and going to a little place at a distance,
where the honest men had made a re to dress
their victuals, he takes a rebrand, and claps it
to the outside of their hut, and very fairly set
it on re; and it would have been all burnt down
in a few minutes, if one of the two had not run to
the fellow, thrust him away, and trod the re out
"with his feet, and that ‘not without some difii-
culty too. i '
The fellow was in such a. rage at the honest
man’s thrusting hY?n away, that he turned upon him
with a pole he had in his hand; and had not the
man avoided the blow very nimbly, and run into
the hut, he had ended his days at once. His com-
rade seeing the danger they were both in, ran in
after him, and immediately they came both out
with their muskets; and the man that was rst
struck at with the pole, knocked the fellow down
who began the quarrel with the__ stock of his mus~
lcet, and that before the other two could come tn
help him; and then seeing the rest come at them,
they stood together, and, presenting the other ends
of their pieces to them, bade them stand off.
The others had re-arms with them too; but one
of the two honest men, holder than his comrade,
and made desperate by his danger, told them, if
they o’ered to move hand or foot, they were all
dead men; and boldly coinmrmded them to lay
dowu their arms. They did not,'indeed, lay down
their arms; but seeing him so resolute, it brought
them to a paring, and they consented to take their
wounded man with them, and he gone: and, in-
deed, it seems the fellow was wounded suieiently
with the blowi I-Iowevcr, they 'were much in the
wrong, since they had the advantage, that they
did not disarm them effectually, as they might have
done, and have gone immediately to the Spaniards.
and’ given them an account how the rogues had
treated them ; for the three. villains studied nothing
but revenge, and every day gave them some intima-
tion that they did so. I V
. But not to crowdythis part with an account of
the lesser partof tlieirrogueries, such as treading
down their corn, shooting three young kids, and a
she goat, which the poor men had got to breedup
tame for their store; and, in a word, plaguing them
night and day in this manner; it forced the t.wo
men to such a desperation, that they resolved to
ght them all three the rst time they had a fair
opportunity. In order to do this, they resolved to
go to the castle, as they called it, that was my old
dwelling, where the three rogues and the Spaniards
all lived together, at that time, intending to have a
fair battle, and the Spaniards should stand by to
see fair play. So they got up in the morning before
day, and came to the place, and called the English-
men by their names, telling a Spaniard that answer-
ed, that they wanted to speak with them.
It happened that the day before two of the Spa-
niards having been in the woods, had seen one
of the two Englishmen, whom, for distinction, I call
the honest men; and he had made a sad complaint
to the Spaniards, of the barbarous usage they had
met with from their three countrymen, and how
they had ruined their plantation, and destroyed
their corn, that they had laboured so hard to bring
forward, and killed the mileh-goat, and their three
kids, which was all they had provided for their sus-
tenance; and that if he and his friends, meaning
the Spaniards, did not assist them again, they
should be starved. When the Spaniards came
home at night, and they were all at supper, he took
the freedom to reprove the three Englislnnen,
though in gentle and mannerly terms, and ask-
ed them, ho\v theycould he so cruel, they being
harmless, inoffensive fellows; and that they were
putting themselves in a way to subsist by their
labour, and that it had cost them la greal deal
1
non-mson ettoson. .373
of .pains- to bring things to such a perfection as
they had. . _
- One of- the Englishmen returned very briskly,
-what had they to do there: that they came on
shore without leave, and that they should not plant
or build upon the island; it was none of their
ground. ‘,Why,’ says the Spaniard‘, very calmly,
f Seignior Inglese, they must not starve.’ The Eng-
-lishman replied, like at true rou';h-lxesvn tarpaulin,
they might starve and be d--ned: they should not
plant, nor build in that place. ‘ But what must
they do then, seignior?’ says the Spaniard. An-
other of the brutes rc-.turned,,,Do! d-_--n them, they
should be servants, and avork for them. ‘ But how
-can you expect that of them? They are not bought
with your money : you have no right to make them
servants.’ The >Englishmc-in answered, the island
was theirs, the governor had given it to them, and
no man had any thing to do there but themsc-lves.;
and with that swore by his Maker, that they would
go and burn all their new huts: they should build
none upon their land. _
, ‘ Why, seignior,’ says the Spaniard, ‘ by the same
rule, we must be your servants too.’ ‘ Aye,“ says
the bold dog, ‘and so you shall too, before we have
done with you,’ mixing two or three "G-d d---n
me's‘ in the proper intervals of his speech. The
Spaniard only smiled at that, and made him no an-
swer. Ilowever, this little discourse had heated
them; and starting up, one says to the other, I
think it was he they called Will Atkins, ‘ Come,
Jack, let us go and have t'other brush with them:
,we’ll demolish their castle, 1’ll warrant you; they
shall plant no colony in our dominions.’
, Upon this, they went all trooping away, with
every man a gun, a pistol, and a sword, and mut-
tered some insolent things among themselves, of
.what they would do t_o the Spaniards too, when op-
poi'tunity oered. But the Spaniards, it seems, did
not so perfectly understand them, as to know all the
particulars; only that, in general, they threatened
them hard for_tal<ing the two I-3nglishn1en’s part.
Whither they went, or how they bestowed their
time that evening, the Spaniards said, they did not
know ; but it seems they wandered about the coun-
try, part of the night, and then lying down in the
place which I used to call my bower, they were
weary, and overslept themselves. The case was
this: they had resolved to stay till midnight, and
so take the poor men when they were asleep; and,
as they acknowledged afterwards, intended to set
re to their huts, while they were in them, and
either burn them in them, or murder them as
they came out. And as malice seldom sleeps very
sound, it was very strange they should not have
been kept waking.
However, as the two men had also a design upon
them, as I have said, though a much fairer one than
that of burning and murdering, it happened, and
very luckily for them all, that they were up and
gone abroad, before the bloody-minded rogues came
to their huts.
When they came thither, and found the men
gone, Atkins, who, it seems, was the for-wardest
man, called out to his comrades, ‘ Ha! Jack, here‘s
the nest; but, d---n them, the birds are own.’
They mused a while to think what should be the
occasion of their being gone abroad so soon, "and
suggested presently that the Spaniards had given
them notice of it; and with that they shook hands,
and swore to one another, that they would be re-
venged of the Spaniards. As soon as they had
made this bloody bargain, they fell to work with
the poor men‘s habitation. They did not set re
indeed to any thing, but they pulled down both
their houses; and pulled them so limb from limb
that they left not the least stick standing, or scarce
any sign on the ground where they stood. They
tore all their little collected household stuff in
pieces, and threw every thing about in such a man-
neg, that ‘the poor men found, afterwards, some of
their thing$,_,,mile off from their habitation.
_When they had done this, they pulled yup all the
young, trees which the poor men had planted:
pulled up the enclosure they had made to secure
their cattle and their corn; and, in a word, sacked
and plundered every thing as completely as a horde
of Tartars would have done,
The two men were, at this juncture, gone to nd
them out,‘ and had resalved to ght them where~
ever they had been, though they were but two to
three: so that, had they met, there certainly would
have been bloodshed among them; for they were
all very stout, resolute fellows, to give them their
due, '
But Providence tool: more care to keep them
asunder, than they themselves could do to meet;
for, as if they had dogged one another, when the
three were gone thither, the two were here; and
afterwards when the two went back to nd them,
the three were come to the old habitation again:
we shall see their differing conduct presently.
When the three came back, like furious creatures,
ushed with the rage which the work they had
been about had put them into, they came up to the
Spaniards, and told them what they had done, by
way of scoff and bravado; and one of them Sl‘.Gp<
ping up to one of the Spaniards, as if they had
been a couple of boys at play, takes hold of his
hat, as it was upon "his head; and giving it a twirl
about, eering in his face, says he to him, ‘ And
you, seignior Jack Spaniard, shall have the same
sauce, if you do not mend your manners.’ The
Spaniard, who, though a quiet, civil man, was as
brave as a man could be desired to be, and withal
a strong well-made man, looked steadily at him,
for a good while; and then, having no weapon iu
his hand, stepped gravely up to him, and, with one
blow of his st, knocked him down, as an ox_ is fell-
ed with la pole-axe; at which one of the rogues,
376' Itoeinsoéu "eaesoai
insolent as the rst‘, red his-pistol at the S'paniard
immediately. He missed his body, indeed, for the‘
iiulletsi went through his hair; but~one"of them
touched the tip ‘of hisiear, and he bled pretty much.‘
The blood "made the Spaniard believe he was more
hurt than’ he really was, and that put him into
some heat; for before he acted all in a perfect calm;
but, now resolving to go through with his work, he
stooped, and took the fe.llow’s musket whom‘ he had
knocked down, and was just going to shoot the. man
who had red at him, when the rest of the Spa-'
niards, being in the cave, came out, and, calling to
him not to shoot, they stepped in, secured the other
two, and took their arms from them. i, ~
When they were thus dis-armed, and found they
liad made all the Spaniards their enemies, as well
as theirown countrymen, they began to cool, and»;
giving the Spaniards better words, would have had
their arms again; but the Spaniards, considering
the feud that was‘ between them and the other two
Englishmen, and that it would be the best method
they could take, to keep them from one another;
told'them they would do them no harm ;i and if
they would live pcaceabl y, they would be very will-
ing to assist and associate with them, as they did
before; but that they could not think of giving them
their arms again, while -they appeared so resolved
to do mischief with them to their own countrymen,
and had even threatened them all to make them
their servants.
5 'l‘h'e rogues were not more capable to hear rea-
son, than to act reason; and, being refused their,
arms, they went raving away, and raging like mad-
rnen, threatening what they would do, though they?
had no re-arms But the Spaniards, despising
their threatening, told them, they should take cure
how‘ they offered any injury to their plantation or
cattle; for if they did, they would shoot them, as
they would do ravenous beasts, wherever tliey
found them; and if they fell intotheir hands alive,
they would certainly be hanged. However, this
was far from cooling them; but away they went
raging and swearing, like furies of hell. As soon
as they were gone, came back the two men, in pas-
sion and rage enough also, though of another kind:
for having been at their plantation, and nding
it all demolished and destroyed, as above, it will
easily be supposed they had provocation enough:
they could scarce have room to tell their tale, the
Spaniards were so eager to tell them theirs; and
it was strange enough to nd, that three men
should thus bully nineteen, and receive no punish-
mt-nt at all.
- The Spaniards, indeed, despised them, and, espe-
cially having thus disarmed them, made light of
their tbreatenings; but the two Englishmen re-
solved to have'their remedy against them, what
pains soever it cost to nd them out.
But the Spaniards interposed here too, and told
them, that as they were already disarmed, they could
not consent that they (the two) should pursue
them with re-arms, and perhaps kill them. ‘ But,’
said the grave Spaniard, who was their governor,
‘ we will endeavour to make them do you justice,
if you will leave it to us; for as there is no doubt
but they will come to us again when their passion
is over, being not able to subsist without our as-
sistance, we promise you to make no peace with
them, without having a full_satis_i’action for you;
and, upon this condition, we hope you will promise
to use no violence with them, other than in your
own defence.
The two Englishmen yielded to this very awk-
wardly, and with great reluctance; but the Spa-
niards protested, they did it only to keep them
from bloodshed, and to make all easy at last;
' for,’ said they, ‘ we are not so many of us: hero
is room enough for us all, and it is great pity we
should not he all good friends.’ At length they did
consent, and waited for the issue of the thing, liv-
ing for some days with the Spaniards; for their
own habita-tion was destroyed. .1
_ In about ve days‘ time, the three vagrants, tired
with wandering, and almost starved with hunger,
having chiey lived on turtlels eggs all that while,
came back tothe grove; and nding my Spaniard,
‘who, as I have said, was the governor, and two
more with him, walking by the side of the creek:
they came up in a very submissive, humble man-
ncr, and begged to be received again into the
family. The Spaniards used them civilly, but told
thern, they had acted so unnaturally by their coun-
trymen, and so very grossly by them (the Spa-
niards), that they could‘ not come to any conclu-
siou without consulting the two Englishmen, and
the rest. But, however, they would go to them,
and discourse about it, and they should know in
half an hour. _1t may be guessed, that they were
very hard put to it; for, it seems, as they were to
wait this half hour for an answer, they begged they
would send them outsome bread in the mean time;
which they did, and sent them, at the same time,
a large piece of goat's flesh, and a broiled parrot,
which they cat very heartily, for they were hungry
enough. . ;
After half an hour’s consultation, they were
called in, and a long debate had about them, their
two countrymen charging thcm. with the ruin of all
their labour, and a design to murder them: all
which they owned before, and therefore could not
deny now. Upon the whole, the Spaniards acted
the moderators between them; and as they had
obliged the two Englishmen not to hurt the three,
while they were naked and unarmed, so they
now obliged the three to go and rebuild their
fellows’ two huts, one to be of the same dimen-
sions, and the other larger than before; also to
fence their ground again, where-they had pulled
up the fences, plant trees in the room of those
pulled up, dig up the land again for planting corn,
wherethey had spoiled it; and. in a word, to rc-
store every thing in the same state as they found
it, as near as they could; for entirely it could not
be, the season for the corn, and the growth of the
trees and hedges, not being possible to be re-
govercd. - - -
, Well, they submitted to all this; and as they
had plenty of provisions given them all the while,
-they grew very orderly, and the whole society
began to live pleasantly and agreeably together;
again; only that these, three fellows could never
be persuaded to work; I mean, for themselves,
except now and then a little, just as they pleased.
llowever, the Spaniards told them plainly, that if
they would butlive sociably and friendly together,
and study, in the whole, the good of the plantation,
they would be content to work for them, and let
them walk about and be as idle as they pleased:
and thus having lived pretty well together for a
month or two, the Spaniards gave them, their arms
again, and gave them liberty to go abroad with them
as before. - l
It was not above a wee]; after they had these
arms and went abroad, but the ungrateful creatures
began to be -insolent and troublesome as before.
But, - however, an accident happening presently
upon this, which endangered‘ the safety of them
all, they were obligedto lay by all private re-
sontments, and look to the preservation of their
lives. A
- It happened one night, that the Spaniard gover-
nor, as l call him; that is to say,‘ the Spaniard,
whose life lhad saved, who was now the captain,
or leader, or governor of the rest, found himself
.v0ry uneasy in the night, and could by no means
get any sleep. Ilc was perfectly well in body, as
he told me the story, only found his thoughts tu-
multuous: his mind ran upon men lighting, and
-killing one another, but was broad awake, and
could not by any means get any sleep. In short,
he lay a great while, but growing more and more
uneasy, he resolved to rise. As they lay, being
so many of them, upon goat-skins, laid thick upon
such couches and pads as they made for them-
selves, and not in hammocks and ship-beds, as
I did, who was but one: so they had little to do,
when they were willing to rise, but to get up upon
their feet, and, perhaps, put on a coat, such as it
was, and their pumps, and they were ready for
going any way that their thoughts guided them.
Being thus gotten up, he looked out; but, being
dark, he could see little or nothing: and, besides,
the trees which I had planted, as in my former ac-
count is described, and which were now grown tall,
intercepted his sight, so that he could only look
up, and see that it was a clear star-light night;
and, hearing no noise, he returned, and laid him
down again; but it was all one, he could not sleep,
nor could he compose himself to any thing like
rest, but his thoughts were, to the last degree, un-
easy, and yet he knew not for what.
I-Iaving made some noise with rising and walking
about, going out and coming in, another of them
Waked, and, calling, asked who it was that was
up. The governor told him, how it had been with
him. ‘ Say you so?’ says the other Spaniard. ‘Such
things are not to be slighted, I assure you : there is
certainly some mischief working,’ says he, ‘ near
us.’ And presently he asked ‘him, ‘ Where are the
Englishmen?’ _‘ They are all in their huts,’ says h__e,
‘ safe enough.’ It seems, the Spaniards had kept
possession» of ‘the main apartment, and had made
a place where the three Englishmen, since their
last mutiny, always quartered by themselves, and
could not come at the rest. ‘ ‘Well,’ says the Spa.
niard, ‘ there is something in it, I am persuaded
from my own experience. I am satised our spirits
embodied have a converse with, and receive intelli-
gence from, the spirits unembodied, and inhabiting
the invisible world , and this friendly notice is given
for our advantage, if we know how to make use
of it. Come,’ says he, ‘let us go out, and look
abroad; and if we nd nothing at all in it to justify
our trouble, I will tell you a story to the purpose,
that shall convince you of the justice of my pro-
posing it.’,
In a word, they went out to go the top of the
hill, where I used to go; but they, being strong, and
in good company, not alone, as I was, used none of
my cautions, to go up by the ladder, and then pull-
ing it up after them, to go up a second stage to
the top, but were going round through the grove,
unconcerned and unwary, when they were sur-
prised with sec-ing a light, as of re, a very little
way oil" from them, and hearing the voices of men,
not of one, or two, but of a great number.
In all the discoveries I had made of the savages
landing on the island, it was my constant care to
prevent them making the least discovery of there
being any inhabitant upon the place; and when, by
any occasion, they came to know it, they felt it so
effectually, that they that got away were scarce
able to give any account of it; for they disappeared
as soon as possible; nor did ever any that had seen
me escape to tell any one else, except it were
the three savages in our last encounter, who jump.
ed into the boat, of whom I mentioned that I was
afraid they should go home, and bring more help.
Whether it was the consequence of the escape of
those men, that so great a number came now to-
gether; or whether they came ignorantly, and by
accident, on their usual bloody errand, the Spa-
niards eould not, it seems, understand. But what-
ever it was, it had been their business, either to-
have concealed themselves, and not have seen
them at all, much less to have let the savages have
seen that there were any inhabitants in the place ;
or to have "fallen upon them so effectually, as that
not a man of them should have escaped, which
could only have been by getting in between them
and their boats; but this presenceef mmdwas want-‘
iug to them, which was the ruin of their tranquil-
lity for a great while. - - -
- We need not doubt, but that th-e governor, and‘
the man with him, surprised with this sight, ran
back immediately, and raised their fellows, giving
them‘ an account of the imminent danger they
were all in; and they again as readily took the
alarm; but it was impossible to persuade them to-
stay close within where they were, but that they
must run all out to see how things stood.
. While it was dark, indeed, they were well enough,-
and they had opportunity enough, for some hours,
to view them by the light of three res, they had'
made, at some distance from one another. What
they were doing, they knew not, and what to do-
themselvos,- they knew not; for, rst, the enemy
were too many; and, secondly, they did not keep‘
together, but were divided into several parties,
and were on shore in several places. ~
i The Spaniards were in no small consternation at‘-
this sight; and as they found that the fellows ran‘
straggling all over the shore, they made no doubt,
but, rst or last, some of them would chop in
upon their habitation, or upon some other place,
where they would see the tokens of inhabitants;
and they were in great perplexity also for fear of
tlieiroek of goats, which would have been little
less than starving them, if they should have been
destroyed; so‘ the rst thing they resolved upon,
was, to dispatch three men away, before it was-
light, viz. two Spaniards and one Englishman, to
drive all thegoats away to the great valley where?
the cave was, and, if need were, to drive them into'
the very cave itself‘. -
l‘ Could they have seen the savages altogether in
one body, and at any dislzmee from their canoes,
they resolved, if they had been a hundred of them;
to have attacked them; but that could not be ob-\
tained, for they were some» of them two, miles oi?
from the other, and, as it appeared afterwards, were
of two different nations. g '
After having mused a great while on the course
they should take, and beaten their brains in cow-
sidering their present circumstances, they resolved
at last, while it was dark, to send the old savage
(Friday’s father) out, as a spy, to learn, if possible,
something concerning them, as what they came for,
and what they intended to do, and the like. The
old man readily undertook it, and, stripping him-
self quite naked, as most of the savages were, away
he went. After he had been gone an hour or two,
he brings word, that he had been among them un-
discovered, that he found they were two parties,
and of two several nations, who had war with one
another, and had had a great battle in their own
country, and that both sides having had several
prisoners taken in the ght, they were, by mere
chance, landed in the same island, for the devour-
ing their prisoners, and making merry; but their
coming so by chance to the same place had spoiled
all their mirth; that they were in a great rage at
one another, and were so near that he believed
they would ght again, as soon as daylight began
to appear: but he did not perceive that they had‘
any notion of any body’s being on the island but
themselves. He had hardly made an end of tell-
iug his story, when they could perceive by the
unusual noise they made, that the two little‘
armies were engaged in a bloody ght.
Frid_ay's_ father used all the arguments he coulrf
to persuade our peopleto lie close, _and not be
seen. He told them their safety consisted in it,
and that they had nothing to do but to lie still,
and the savages would kill one another to their
hands,_and then the rest would go away; and it was‘
so tea tittle. But it was impossible to prevail, cspe--
eially upon the Englislnmin; their curiosity was so‘
importunate upon their prudentials, that they must
run out and see the battle. However, they used some
caution too, viz. they did not go openly, just by
their own dwelling, but went farther into the woods,
and placed themselves to advantage, where-they
might securely see them manage the ght, and,
as they thought, ‘notebe seen by them; but, it
seems, the savages did see them, as we shall nd
hereafter.
The battle was very erce, and, if I might be.
lieve the Englishmen, one of them said, he could
perceive, that some of'them_ were men of great
bravery, of invincible spirits, and of great po.
licy in guiding the ght. The battle, they said,
held two hours, before they could guess which
party would be beaten; but then that party which
was nearest our people’s habitation began to ap-
pear weakest, and after some time more, some of
them began to y; and this put our men again
into a great consternation, lest any of those that
fled should run into the grove, before their dwell-
ing, ‘for shelter, and thereby involuntarily discover
the place; and that, by consequence, the pursuers
should do the like in search for them. Upon this,
they resolved that they would stand armed within
the wall, and whoever came into the grove, they
should sally out over the wall, and kill them; so
that, if possible, not one should return to give an
account of it: they ordered also, that it should
be done’ with their swords, or by knocking them
down with the stock of the musket, not by shoot-
ing them, for fear of raising an alarm by the
noise.
As they expected, it fell out: three of the rout-
ed army ed for life, and, crossing the creek, ran
directly into the place, not in the least knowing
whither they went, but running as into a thick
wood for shelter. The scout they kept to look
abroad, gave notice. of this within, with this ad-
dition, to our men's great satisfaction, viz. that
the conquerors had not pursued them, nor seen
which way they were gone. Upon this, the Spa-
niard governor, a man of humanity, would not
suffer them to kill the three fugitives; but, send-
ing three men out by the top of the hill, ordered
them to' go round, and come in behind them, sur-
prise and take them prisoners, which was done.
The residue of the conquered people ed to their
canoes, and got oif to sea; the victors retired, and
made no pursuit, or very little, but drawing them-
selves into a body together, gave two great scream-
ing shouts, which they supposed was by way of
triumph; and so the ght ended. And the same
day, about three o'clock in the afternoon, they also
marched to their canoes. And thus the Spaniards
had their island again free to themselves, their fright
was over, and they saw no savages in several years
after.
After they were all gone, the Spaniards came out
of their den; and viewing the eld of battle, they
found about two-and-thirty dead ‘men upon the
spot: some were killed with great,-long arrows,
several of which were found sticking in their bodies;
but most of them were killed with their great
wooden swords, sixteen or seventeen of which they
they found in the eld of battle, and as many
bows, with a great many arrows. These swords
were great, unwieldy things, and they must be
very strong men that used them. Most ‘of those
men that were killed with them had their heads
mashed to pieces, as we may say; or, as we call it
in English, their brains knocked out, and several
of their arms and -legs broken: so that it is evi-
dent they light with inexpressible rage and fury.
They found not one wounded man that was not
stone -dead; for either they stay by their enemy till
they have quite killed him, or they carry all the
wounded men, that are not quite dead, away with
them.
This deliverance tamed our Englishmen for a
great while; the sight had lled them with horror,
and the consequences appeared terrible to the
S
last degree, especially upon supposing that somg
time or other they should fall into the hands of
those creatures, who would not only kill them as
enemies, but kill them for food, as we kill our
cattle. And they professed to me, that the thoughts
of being eaten up like beef or mutton, though it
was supposed it was not to be till they were dead,
had something in it so horrible, that it nauseated
their very stomachs, made them sick when they
thought of it, and lled their minds with such un-
usual terror, that they were not themselves for some
wceks after.
This, as I said, tamed even the three English
brutes I have been speaking of; and, for a great
while after, they were very tractable, and went
about the common business of the whole society
well enough; planted, sowed, reaped, and be-
gan to be all naturalized to the country: but
some time after this, they fell all into such mea-
sures again as brought them into a great deal of
trouble.
They had taken three prisoners, as I have observ.
1-d; and these three being lusty, stout, young fel-
lows, they made them servants, and taught them to
work for them; and as slaves, they did well enough.
But,’ they did not take their measures with them,
as I did by my man Friday, viz. to begin with
them upon the principle of having saved their
lives, and then instruct them in the rational prin-
ciples of life, much less of religion, eivilizing and
reducing them by kind usage, and affectionate ar.
guings; but, as they gave them their food every
day, so they gave them their work too, and lgept
them fully employed in drudgery enough: but
they failed in this by it, that they never had them
to assist them and ght for them, as I had my man
Friday, who was as true to me as the very esh
upon my bones.
But to come to the family part: being all now
good friends (-for common danger, as I said above,
had eectually reconciled them), they began to
consider their general circumstances. And the rst
thing that came under their consideration was,
whether seeing the savages particularly haunted
that side of the island, and that there were more
remote and retired parts of it equally adapted to
their way of living, and manifestly to their advan-
tage; they should not rather remove their habita-
tion, and plant in some more proper place for their
safety, and especially for the security of their cattle
and corn.
Upon this, after long debate, it was concluded,
that they would not remove their habitation, be~
cause that some time or other they thought they
might hear from their governor again, meaning
me; and if I should send any one to seek them, I
would be sure to direct them on that side, where,
if they should nd the place demolished, they
would conclude the savages had killed us all, and
we were gone; and so our supply would go away
too.
But as to their corn and cattle, they agreed to
remove them into the valley where my cave was,
where the land was as proper for both, and where
indeed there was land enough. However, upon
second thoughts, they altered one part of that reso-
lution too, and resolved only to remove part of
their cattle thither, and plant part of their corn
there; and so, if one part was destroyed, the other
might be saved. And one piece of prudence they
used, which it was very well they did; viz. that
they never trusted those three savages, which they
had taken prisoners, with knowing any thing of the
plantation they had made in that valley, or of any
cattle they‘ had there; much less of the cave there,
which they kept in case of necessity, as a safe re-
treat; and whither they carried also the two barrels
of powder, which I had sent them at my coming
away.
But, however, they resolved not to change their
habitation; yet they agreed that, as I had carefully
covered it rst with a wall or fortication, and then
with a grove of trees; so, \seeing their safety con-
sisted entirely in their being concealed, of which
they were now fully convinced, they set to work
to cover and conceal the place yet more effectually
than before. To this pnrpose, as I had planted
trees (or rather thrust in stakes, which in time all
grew to be.trees) for some good distance before the
entrance into my apartment, they went on in the
same manner, and lled up the rest of that whole
space of ground, from the trees I had set, quite
down to the side of the creek, where, as I said,
I landed my oats, and even in the very ooze
where the tide owed, not so much as leaving any
place to land, or any sign that there had been any
landing thereabout. These stakes also being of a.
wood very forward to grow, as I have noted for-
merly, they took care to have generally very much
larger and taller than those which I had planted,
and placed them so very thick and close, that when
they had been three or four years grown, there was
no piercing with the eye any considerable way into
the plantation. As for that part which I had
planted, the trees were grown as thick as a man's
thigh; and among them they placed so man J other
short ones, and so thick, that, in a word, it stood
like a palisado, a quarter of a mile thick, and it
was next to impossible to penetrate it, but with
a little army, to cut it all down; for a little dog
could hardly get -between the trees, they stood so
close.
But this was not all; for they did the same
by all the ground, to the right hand and to the
left, and round even to the top of the hill, leaving
no ,way, not so much as for themselves to come
out, but by the ladder placed up to the side of
the hill, and then lifted up, and placed again
from the rst stage up to the top, which lad.
der, when it was taken down, nothing but what
had wings or witchcraft to assist it, could come
at them.
This was excellently well contrived: nor was it
less than what they afterwards found occasion for,
which served to convince me, that as human pru-
dence has the authority of Providence to justify it,
so it has, doubtless, the direction of Providence to
set it to work; and, would we listen carefully to
the voice of it, I am fully persuaded we might
prevent many of the disasters which our lives are
now by our own negligence subjected to. But this
by the way.
I return to the story. They lived two years
after this in perfect retirement, and had no more
visits from thesavages. They had, indeed, an
alarm given them one morning, which put them
into a great consternation; for some of the Spa-
niards being out early one morning, on the west
side, or rather end, of the island, which, by the
way, was that end where I never went, for fear
of being discovered, they were surprised with see-
ing above twenty canoes of Indians, just coming
on shore.
They made the best of their way home, in hurry
enough; and giving the alarm to their comrades,
they kept close all that day and the next, going
out only at night, to make observation. But
they had the good luck to be mistaken; for
wherever the savages went, they did not land at
that time in the island, but pursued some other
design.
And now they had another broil with the three
Englishmen, one of which, a most turbulent fellow,
being in a rage at one of the three slaves which
I mentioned they had taken, because the fellow
had not done something right which he bade him
do, and seemed a little untractable in his showing
him, drew a hatchet out of a frog belt, in which he
wore it by his side, and fell upon the poor savage,
not to correct him, but to kill him. One of the
Spaniards, who was _by, seeing him give the fellow
a barbarous cut with the hatchet, which he aimed
at his head, but struck into his shoulder, so that
he thought he had cut the poor creaturefs arm off,
ran to him, and, entreating him not to murder the
poor man, clapped in between him and the savage,
to_ prevent the mischief. y
The fellow, being enraged the more at this, struck
at the Spaniard with his hatchet, and swore he
would serve him as he intended to serve the sa-
vage, which the Spaniard perceiving, avoided the
blow, and, with a shovel, which he had in his hand
(for they were working tin the eld about their
corn land), knocked the brute down. Another of
the Englishmen, running at the same time to help
his comrade, knocked the Spaniard down; and
then two Spaniards more came to -help their man,
and a third _Englishman, fell upon them. They
had none oi’ them any re-arms-, or_ any other wea-
pons, but hatchets and other tools, except this
third English:-nan: he had one of my old rusty
,~eutla.sses, with which he made at the last Spa»
niards, and wounded them both. This fray set the
whole family in an uproar, and more help coming
in, they took the three Englishmen prisoners. The
next question was, what should he done with them.
They had been so often mutinous, and were so
furious, so desperate, and so idle withal, that they
knew not what course to take with them; for they
were mischievous to the. highest degree, and valued
not what hurt they did to any man ; so that, in
short, i't was not safe to live with them.
T-he Spaniard who was governor, told them in
so many words, that if they had been his own
countrymen, he would have hanged them all; for
.a.ll laws, and all governors, were to preserve so-
ciety ; and those who were dangerous to society,
ought to be. expelled out of it: but as they were
Englishmen, and that it was to the generous kind-
ness of an Englishman. that they allowed their
.~prese.rvation and deliverance, he would use them
~with all possible lenity, and would leave them to
the judgement of the two other Englishmen, who
were their countrymen.
One of the two honest Englishmen stood up, and
said, they desired it might not be left to them;
‘ For,’ says he, ‘ I am sure we ought to sentence
them to the gallows.’ And with that he gives an
account how William Atkins, one of the three, had
proposed to have all the ve'Englishmen join to-
-gether, and murder all the Spaniards, when they
were in their sleep.
When the Spaniard governor heard this, he calls
to Will Atkins, ‘ How, seignior Atkins,’ says he,
‘ would you murder us all? What have you to say
to that 5" That hardened villain was so far from
denying it, that he said it was true; and G-d
d~mn him they would do it still before they had
done with them. ‘ Well, but seignior Atkins,’ said
‘the Spaniard, ‘ what have we ‘done to you that you
would kill us? and what would you get by killing
us? and what must we do to prevent your killing
us? Must we kill you, or you will kill us? Why
will you put us to the necessity of this, sei-
gnior Atkins?’ says the Spaniard very calmly, and
smiling.
Seignior Atkins was in such a rage at the Spa-
niard’s making a jest of it, that, had he not been
held by three men, and withal had no weapons
‘with him, it was thought he would have attempted
to have killed the Spaniard in the middle of all the
-company.
. ’Ihis.ha.re-brained carriage obliged them to con-
sider seriously what was to be done. The two
Englishmen and the Spaniard who saved the poor
.savage, was of the opinion, that they should hang
.one of the three for an example to the rest; and
that particularly it should be he that had twice
attempted to commit murder with his hatchet;
~and,_ indeed, there was some reason to believe he
had done it, for the poor savage was in such a
miserable condition with the wound he had re-
ceived; that it was thought he could not live.
But the governor Spaniard still said, ‘ No, it
was an Englishman that had saved all their lives,
and he would never consent to put an English-
man to death, though he had murdered half of
them-r'nay, he said, if he had been killed himself
by an Englishman, and had time left to speak, it
should be, that they would pardon him.
This was so positively insisted on by the go-
vernor Spaniard, that there was no gainsaying it:
and as merciful counsels are most apt to prevail,
where they are so earnestly pressed. so they all
came into it; but then it was to be considered,
what should be done to keep them from doing the
mischief they designed, for all agreed, governor and
all,~~that means were to be used for preserving the
society from danger. After along debate it was
agreed, rst, that they should be disarmed, and
not permitted to have either gun, or powder, or
shot, or sword, or any weapon; and should be
turned out of the society, and left to live where
they would, and how they could, by themselves:
but that none of the rest, either Spaniards or I:3ng~
lish, should converse with them, speak with them,
or have any thing to do with them; that they
should be forbid to come within a certain distance
of the place where the rest dwelt; and that if they
olfcrcd to commit any disorder, so as to spoil,
burn, kill, or destroy any of the corn, plantings,
buildings, fences, or cattle belonging to the society,
that they should die without mercy, and they should
shoot _them wherever they could nd them. ~
The governor, a man of great humanity, musing
upon the sentence, considered a little upon it, and,
turning to the two honest Englishmen, said, ‘ Hold,
you must reect that it will be long ere they can
raise corn and cattle of their own, and they must
not starve 3 we must, therefore, allow them provi-
sions.’ So he caused to be added, that they should
have a proportion of corn given them to last them
eight months, and for seed to sow, by which time
they might be supposed to raise some of their
own ; that they should have six niilch-goats, four
he-goats, and six kids given them, as well for pre-
sent subsistence, as for a store; and that they
should have tools given them for their work in
the elds; such as six hatchcts, an axe, a saw, and
the like: but they should have none of these tools,
or provisions, unless they would swear solemnly,
that they would not hurt or injure any of the Spa-
niards with them, or of their fellow Englishmen.
’I‘hus they dismissed them the society, and turned
them out to shift for themselves. They went away
sullen and refractory, as neither contented to go
away, nor to stay; but, as there was no remedy,
they went pretending to go and choose a place
where they would settle themselves to plant and
live by themselves; and some provisions were given
them, but no weapons.
About four or ve days after, they came again
for some victuals, and gave the governor an ac-
count where they had pitched their tents, and
marked themselves out a habitation and plantation.
It was a very convenient place indeed, on the
remotest part of the island, N. E. much about the
place where I providentially landed in my rst
voyage, when I was driven out to sea, the Lord
knows whither, in my foolish attempt to surround
the island.
Here they built themselves two handsome huts,
and contrived them in a manner like my rst ha-
bitation, being closo under the side of a hill, hav-
ing some trees growing already on three sides of
it, so that by planting others, it would be very
easily covered from the sight, unless narrowly
searched for. They desired some dried goat-skins
for beds and covering, which were given them;
and, upon giving their words, that they would not
S 2
disturb the rest, or injure any of their plantations,
they gave them hatchets, and what other tools they
could spare, some pease, barley, and rice, for sow-
ing, and, in a word, any thing they wanted, but
arms and ammunition.
_ They lived in this separate condition about six
months, and had gotten in their rst harvest,
though the quantity was-but small, the parcel of
land they had planted being but little; for, indeed,
having all their plantation to form, they had a
great deal of work upon their hands: and when
they came to make boards, and pots, and such
things, they were quite out of their element, and
could make nothing of it; and when the rainy
season came on, for want of a cave in the earth,
they could not keep their grain dry, and it was in
great danger of spoiling. And this humbled them
much; so they came and begged the Spaniards to
help them, which they very readily did; and in
four days worked a great hole in the side of the
hill for them, big enough to secure their corn, and
other things, from the rain. But it was but a
poor place at best, compared to mine; and espe-
cially as mine was then, for the Spaniards had
greatly enlarged it, and made several new apart-
ments in it.
About three quarters of a year after this separa-
tion, a new frolic took these rogues, which, together
with the former villany they had committed,
brought mischief enough upon them, and had very
near been the ruin of the whole colony. The
three new associates began, it seems, to be weary of
the laborious life they led, and that without hope
of bettering their circumstances; and a whim took
them, that they would make a.voyage to the con-
tinent, from whence the savages came, and would
try if they could not seize upon some prisoners
among the natives there, and bring them home, so
as to make them do the laborious part of their
work for them,
The project was not so preposterous, if they had
gone no farther; but they did nothing, and pro-
posed nothing, but had either mis'chief in the de-
sign, or mischief in the event: and, if I may give
my opinion, they seemed to be under a blast from
Heaven; for if we will not allow a visible curse to
pursue visible crimes, how shall we reconcile the
events of things with the divine justice? It was
certainly an apparent vengeance on their crime of
mutiny and piracy, that brought them to the state
they were in; and as they showed not the least
remorse for the crime, but added new villanies
to it, such as, particularly, that piece of monstrous
cruelty of wounding a poor slave, because he did
not, or perhaps could not, understand to do what
he was directed; and to wound him in such a marr-
ner, as, no question, made him a cripple all his
life; and in a place where no surgeon or medicine
could be had for his cure; and, what was still
worse, the murderous intent, or, to do justice to
the crime, the intentional murder, for such- to be
sure it was, as was afterwards the formed design
they all laid, to murder the Spaniards in cold
blood, and in their sleep.
But I leave observing, and return to the story.
The three fellows came down to the Spaniards one
morning, and, in very humble terms, desired to be
admitted to speak with them. The Spaniards very
readily heard what they had to say, which was
this: that they were tired of living in the manner
they did; that they were not handy enough to
make the necessaries they wanted, and that, hav-
ing no help, they found they should be starved:
but if the Spaniards would give them leave to take
one of the canoes which they came over in, and
give them arms and ammunition proportioned
for their defence, they would go over to the main,
and seek their fortune, and so deliver them from
the trouble of supplying them with any other pro-
visions. ,
The Spaniards were glad enough to be rid of
them, but yet very honestly represented to them
the certain destruction they were running into;
told them, they had suffered such hardships upon
that very spot, that they could, without any spirit
of prophecy, toll them that they would be starved,
or murdered; and bade them consider of it.
The men replied audaciously, they should be
-starved if they staid here; for they could not
work, and would not work; and they could but
be starved abroad; and if they were murdered,
there was an end of them, they had no wives nor
children to cry after them; and, in short, insisted
importunately upon their demand, declaring that
they would go, whether they would give them any
arms or no. '
T he Spaniards told them with great kindness, that
if they were resolved to go, they should not go like
naked men, and be in no condition to defend them-
selves; and that, though they could ill spare their
lire-arms, having not enough for themselves, yet
they would let them have two muskets, a pistol,
and a eutlass, and each man a hatchet, which they
thought was sutcient for them. _
_ In a word, they accepted the o’er, and having
baked them bread enough to serve them a month,
and given them as much goats’ esh as they could
eat while it was sweet, and a great basket full of
dried grapes, a,pot Full o fresh water, and at young
kid alive to kill, they boldly -set out in a canoe for
a voyage over the sea, where it was at least forty
miles broad.
The boat was, indeed, a large one, and would
have very well carried fteen or twenty men ; and,
therefore, was rather too big for them to manage :
but as they had a fair breeze, and the ood-tide
‘with them, they did well enough. They had made
a mast of a long pole, and asail of four large goats’
skins dried, which they had sewed or -laced to-
gether: and away they went merrily enough. The
I
Spaniards called after them, ‘ Bon veyajo ;’ and no
man ever thought of seeing them any more.
The Spaniards would often say one to another,
and the two honest Englishmen who remained be-
hind, how quietly and comfortably they lived, now
those three turbulent fellows were gone: as for
their ever coming again, that was the remotest
thing from their thoughts that could be imagined ;
when behold, after twenty-two days’ absence, one
of the Englishmen being abroad upon his plant-
ing work, sees three strange men coming towards
him, at a distance, two of them with guns upon
their shoulders.
Away runs the Englishman, as if he was be
witched, and came frighted and amazed to the
governor Spaniard, and tells him they were all
undone; for there were strangers landed upon
the island, he could not tell who. The Spaniard,
pausing a while, says to him, ‘ Ilow do you mean,
you cannot tell who? They are savages, to be
sure.’ ‘ No, no,’ says the Englishman, ‘ they are
men in clothes, with arms.’ ‘ Nay then,’ says the
Spaniard, ‘ why are you concerned? If they are
not savages, they must be friends; for there is no
Christian nation upon earth but will do us good,
rather than harm.’ I
While they were debating thus, came the three
Englishmen, and, standing without the wood, which
was new planted, halloocd to them.‘ They pre-
sently knew their voices, and so all the wonder
ot‘ that kind ceased. But new the admiration was
turned upon another question; viz. what could
be the matter, and what made them come back
again. _ ~
It was not long before they brought the men in,
and inquiring where they had been, and what they
had been doing, they gave them a full account of
their voyage in a few words; viz. that they reached
the land in two days, or something less; but, nd-
;lng the people alarmed at their coming, and pro-
paring with bows and arrows to ght them, they
durst not go on shore, but sailed on to the north-
ward, six or seven hours, till they came to a great
opening, by which they perceived that the land they
saw from our island was not the main, but an
island; that entering that opening of the sea, they
saw another island on the right hand, north, and
several more west; and, being resolved to land
somewhere, they put over to one of the islands
which lay west, and went boldly on shore; that
they found the people very courteous and friendly
to them, and they gave them several roots, and
some dried sh, and appeared very sociable; and
the women, as well as the men, were very forward
to supply them with any thing they could get for
them to eat, and brought it to them a great way
upon their heads.
They continued here four days, and inquired as
Well as they could of them, by signs what nations
were this way, and that way; and were told of
several erce and terrible people, that lived almost
every way, who, as they made known by signs to
them, used to eat men ; but as for tlremselves, they
said that they never eat men or women, except
only such as they took in the wars; and then
they owned that they made a great feast, and cart
their prisoners.
The Englishmen inquired, when they had a feast
of that kind, and they told them two moons ago,
pointing to the moon, and then to two ngers;
and that their great king had two hundred prison-
ers now, which he had taken in his war; and they
were feeding them to make them fat for the next
feast. The Englishmen seemed mighty desirous to
see those prisoners; but the others mistaking
them, thought they were‘ desirous to have some of
them, to carry away for their own eating. So they
beckoned to them, pointing to the setting of the
sun, and then to the rising, which was to signify
that the next morning, at sun-rising, they would
bring some for them; and, accordingly, the next
morning, they brought down ve women, and
eleven men; and gave them to the Englishmen to
carry with them on their voyage, just as we would
bring so many cows and oxen down to a sea-port
town to vietual aship.
As br-utish and barbarous as these fellows were
at home, their stomachs turned at this sight, and
they did not know what to do: to refuse the pri-
oners, which would have been the highest affront to
the savage gentry that offered them; and what to
do with them, they knew not. However, upon
some debate, they resolved to accept of them; and,
in return, they gave the savages that brought them,
one of their hatchets, an old key, a knife, and six
or seven of their -bullets,.which, though they did
not understand, they seemed extremely pleased
with; and then, tying the poor creatures’ hands
behind them, they (the people) dragged the prison-
ers into the boat for our men.
The Englishmen were obliged to come away as
soon as they had them, or else they that gave
them this noble. present, would certainly have ex-
pected that they should have gone to work with
them, have killed two or three of them the next
morning, and, perhaps, have invited the donors
to dinner.
But, having taken their leave, with all the re-
spects and thanks that could well pass between
people, where, on either side, they understood not
one word they could say, they put off with their
boat, and came back towards the rst island, where,
when they arrived, they set eight of their prisoners
at liberty, there being too many of them for their
occasion.
_ In their voyage they endeavoured to have some
communication with their prisoners, but it was im-
possible to make them understand any thing:
nothing they could say to them, or give them, or
do for them, but was looked upon as going about
/
to murder them. They rst of all_ unbound them,
but the poor creatures screamedat that, especially
the women, as if they had just felt the knife at
their throats; for they immediately concluded they
were unbound on purpose to be killed.
If they gave them any thing to eat, it was the
same thing; then they concluded, it was for fear
they should sink in esh, and so not be fat enough
to kill. If they looked at one of them more particu-
larly, the party presently concluded, it was to see
whether he or she was fattest and ttest to kill
rst; nay, after they had brought them quite over,
and began to use them kindly, and treat them well,
still they expected every day to make a dinner or
supper for their new masters.
When the three wandcrers had given this unac-
countable history, or journal, of their voyage, the
Spaniard asked them where their new family was;
and, being told that they had brought them on
shore, and put them into one of their huts, and
were come to beg some victuals for them, they (the
Spaniards), and the other two Englishmen, that is
to say, the whole colony, resolved to go all down to
the place, and see them, and did so, and Friday's
father with _them.
When they came into the hut, there they sat all
bound; for when they had brought them on shore,
they bound their hands, that they might not take
the boat, and make their escape: there, I say, they
sat, all of them stark naked. First, there ‘were
three men, lusty, comely fellows, well shaped,
straight and fair limbs, about thirty to thirty-ve
years of age; and ve women, whereof two might
be from thirty to forty, two more, not above twen-
ty-four or twenty-ve, and the fth, a tall, comely
maiden, about sixteen or seventeen. The women
were well-favoured, agreeable persons, both in
shape and features, only tawny; and two of them,
had they been perfect white, would have passed for
handsome women, even in London itself; having
very pleasant, agreeable countenances, and of a.
very modest behaviour, especially when they came
afterwards to be clothed, and dressed, as they
called it, though that dress was very indiiferent, it
must be confessed: of which hereafter.
The sight, you may be sure, was something un-
couth to our Spaniards, who were (to give them a
just character) men of the best behaviour, of the
most calm, sedate tempers, and perfect good-hu-
mour, that ever I met with; and, in particular, of
the most modesty, as will presently appear: I say,
tlie sight was very uncouth, to see two naked men,
and ve naked women, all together bound, and in
the most miserable circumstances that human na-
ture could be supposed to be, viz. to be expecting
every moment to be dragged out, and have their
brains knocked out, and then to be eaten up, like
a calf that is killed for a dainty.
The rst thing they did was to cause the old In-
dian, Friday’s father, to go in, and see rst if he
knew any of them; and then, if he understood any
of their speech. As soon as the old man came in,
he looked seriously at them, but knew none of
them; neither could any of them understand a.
word he said, or a sign he could make, except one
of the women.
However, this was enough to answer the end,
which was to satisfy them, that the men into whose
hands they were fallen were Christians ; that they
abhorred eating of men or women, and that they
might be sure they would not be killed. As soon
as they were assured of this, they discovered such
a joy, and bysuch awkward and several ways,
as is hard to describe; for it seems they were of
several nations.
The woman, who was their interpreter, was bid,
in the next place, to ask them if they were willing
to be servants, and to work for the men who had
brought them away to save their lives. At which
they all fell a dancing; and presently one fell to
1
taking up this, and another that, any thing that lay
next, to carry on their shoulders, to intimate that
they were willing to work;
The governor, who found that the having women
among them would presentl y be attended with some
inconveniency, and might occasion some strife, and
perhaps blood, asked the three men, what they in.
tended to do with these women, and how they in-
tended to use them, whether as servants or as wo-
men. One of the Englishmen answered very boldly
and readily, that they would use them as both. To
which the governor said, ‘ I am not going to re-
strain you from it; you are your own masters as
to that: but this I think is but just, for avoiding
disorders and quarrel-s among you-, < and I desire it
of you for that reason only, that you will all en-
gage, if any of you take any of these women, as a
woman, or a wife, he shall take but one; and that,
having taken one, none else should touch her; for
though we cannot marry any of you, yet it is but
reasonable, that, while you stay here, the woman
any of you takes, should be maintained by the man
that takes her, and should be his wife: I mean,’
says he, ‘while he continues here, and that none
else shou-ld have any “thing to do with her.‘ All
this appeared so just, that every one agreed to it
_without any difculty.
Then the Englishmen asked the Spaniards if they
designed to take any of them; but every one an-
swered ‘ No.’ Some of them said, they had wives
in Spain, and the others did not like women that
were not Christians; and altogether declared, that
they. would not touch one of them, which was an
instancepof such virtue, as I have -notmet with in
all my travels. On the other hand,. to be short, the
ve Englishmen took ‘them everyone a wife; that
is to say, a temporary wife: and so they set up a
new form of living ; for the Spaniards and Friday's
father, lived in my old habitation, which they
had enlarged exceedingly within: the three serv-
ants, which were taken in the late battle ‘of the
savages, lived with them; and these carried on the
main part of the colony, supplying all the rest with
food, and assisting them in any thing as they could,
or as they found necessity required.
But the wonder of this story was, how ve such
refractory, ill-matched fellows should agree about
these women, and that two of them should not
pitch upon the same woman, especially seeing two
or three of them were, without comparison, more
agreeable than the others, But they took a good
'way enough to prevent quarrelling among them-
selves; for they set the ve women by themselves
‘in one of their huts, and they went all into the
other hut, and drew lots among them, who should
choose rst.
He that drew to choose rst, went away by him-
self to the hut where the poor, naked creatures
were, and fetched out her he chose: and it was
worth observing, that he that chose rst took her
that was reckoned the homeliest, and the oldest
of the ve, which made mirth ‘enough among the
rest; and even the Spaniards laughed at it. But
the fellow considered better than any of them, that
it was application and business that they were to
expect assistance in, as much as any thing else; and
she proved the best wife in the parcel.
When the poor women saw themselves set in a
row thus, and fetched out one by one, the terrors
of their condition returned upon them again, and
they rmly believed, that they were now going to
_be devoured. Accordingly, when the English sailor
came in, and fetched _out one of them, the rest
set up a most lamentable cry, and hung about her,
and took their leave of her with such agonies,
and such affection, as would have grieved the hard-
est heart in the world; nor was it possible for the
Englishmen to satisfy them, that they were not to
be immediately murdered-, till they fetched the old
man, _F_ri<_l_ay’s father, who instantly let themlmow,
that the ve men,who had fetched them out, one by
one, had chosen them for their wives.
' When they had done this, and the fright the wo-
men were in was a little over, the men went to
work, and the Spaniards came and helped them;
and, in afew hours, they had built every one a new
hut, or tent, for their lodging a art: for those they
had already were crowded their tools, house-
hold stuff, and provisions. The three wicked ones
had pitched farthest off, and the two honest ones
nearer, but both on the north shore of the island;
so they continued separate as before. And thus
my island was peopled in three places, and, as
I might say, three towns were begun to be planted.
And here it is very well worth observing, that, as
it often happens in the world (what the wise ends
of God’s providence are in such a disposition of
things, I cannot say), the two honest fellows had
the two worst wives; and the three reprobates, that
were scarce worth hanging, that were t for nothing,
and neither seemed born to do themselves good, nor
any one else, had three clever, diligent, careful,
and ingenious wives: not that the two rst were
ill wives, as to their temper or humour, for all the
ve were most willing, quiet, passive, and sub-
jected creatures, rather like slaves than wives ; but
my meaning is, they were not alike capable, inge-
nious, or industrious, or alike cleanly and neat.
- Another observation I must make, to the honour
of a. diligent application on one hand, and to the
disgrace of a slethful, negligen-t, idle temper, on the
other : that when I came to the place, and viewed
the several improvements, plantings, and manage-
ment of the several little colonies; the two men
had so far outgone the three, that there was no
comparison. They had, indeed, both of them as
much ground laid out for corn as they wanted, and
the reason was, because, according to my rule, na-
ture dictated that it was to no purpose to sow more
corn than they wanted 5 but the difference of the
Oultivation, of the planting, of the fences, and, in-
deed, every thing else, was easy to be seen at rst
view.
.' The two men had innumerable young trees planted
about their huts, that when you came to the place,
nothing was to be seen but a wood; and though
they had twice had their plantation demolished, once
by their own countrymen, and once by the enemy,
as shall be shown in its place, yet they had re-
stored all again, 'and every thing was ourishing
and thriving about them: they had grapes planted
in order, and managed like a vineyard, though they
had themselves never seen any thing of that kind;
and by their good ordering their vines, their grapes
were as good again as any of the others. T-hey had
also found themselves out a retreat in the thickest
part of the \voods,\vliere, though there was not a na»
tural cave, as I had found, yet they made one with
incessant labour of their hands, and where, when
the mischief which followed happened, they se-
cured their wives and children, so as they could
never be found; they having, by sticking innume-
rable stakcs and poles of the wood, which, as I said,
grew so easily, made a grove impassable, except in
one place, where they climbed up to get over the
outside part; and then went in by ways of their
own leaving. _
' As to the three reprobates, as I justly call them,
though they were much civilized by their new settle-
ment, compared to what they were before, and
were not so quarrelsome, having not the same op-
portunity; yet one of the certain companions of a.
proigate mind never left them, and that was their
idleness. It is true, they planted corn, and made
fences ; but Solomon’s words were never better veri-
ed than in them, ‘ I went by the vineyard of the
slothful, and it was all overgrown with thorns 3’ for
when the Spaniards came to view their crop, they
could not see it in some places for weeds: the
liqdge had several gaps in it, where the wild goats
had gotten in, and eaten up the corn. Perhaps
here and there a dead bush was crammed in, to stop
them out for the present; but it_ was only ‘ shut-
ting the stable-door after the steed was stolen:’
whereas, when they looked on the colony of the
other two, there was the very face of industry and
success upon all they did; there was not a weed to
be seen in all their corn, or a gap in any of their
hedges; and they,»on the other hand, veried So-
lomon’s words, in another place, ‘ The diligent
hand makes rich.’ For every thing grew and thriv.
ed, and they had plenty within and without; they.
had more tame cattle than the other, more utensils
and necessaries within doors, and yet more plea-
sure and diversion too.
It is true, the wives of the three were very handy
and cleanly within doors; and, having learned the
the English ways of dressing and cooking from
_9ne of the other Englishmen, who, as I said, was a
oook’s mate on ‘board the ship, they dressed their
husband’s victuals very nicely and well; whereas
the other could not be brought to understand it;
but then the husband, who, as I said, had been
cook's mate, did it himself; but as for the husbands
of the three wives, they loitered about, fetched
turtle’s eggs, and caught sh and birds ; in a word,
any thing but labour; and they fared accordingly.
The diligent lived well and comfortably, and the
slothful lived hard and beggarly; and so, I believe,
generally speaking, it is all over the world.
But now I come to a scene different from all that
had happened before, either to them or to me; and
the original of the story was this:
Early one morning there came on shore ve or
six canoes of Indians, or savages, call them which
you please; and there is no room to doubt, that
they'came upon the old errand of feeding upon
their slaves. But that part was now so familiar to
the Spaniards, and to our men too, that they did
not concern themselves about it, as I did; but,
having been made sensible, by their experiences,
that their only business was to lie concealed, and
that, if they were not seen by any of the savages,
they would go oil’ again quietly when their busi-
ness was done,"having as yet not the least notion
of there being any inhabitants in the island; I say,
having been made sensible of this, they had nothing
to do but to give notice to all the three plantations
to keep within doors, and not show themselves,
only placing a scout in a proper place to give notice
when the boats went o‘ to sea again.
This was without doubt very right; but a disaster
spoiled all these measures, and made it known
among the savages, that there were inhabitants
there, which was, in the end, the desolation of
almost the whole colony. After the canoes with
the savages were gone off, the Spaniards peeped
abroad again, and some of them had the curiosity
to go to the place where they had been, to see
what they had been doing. Here, to their great sur-
prise, they found three savages left behind, and
lying fast asleep upon the ground; it was supposed
they had either been so gorged with their inhuman
feast, that, like beasts, they were asleep, and would
not stir when the others went, or they were wan»
dered into the woods, and did not come back in
time to be taken in.
The Spaniards were greatly surprised at this sight,
and perfectly at a loss what to do. The Spaniard
governor, as it happened, was with them, and his
advice was asked; but he professed he knew not
what to do ; as for slaves, they had enough already,
and as to killing them, they were none of them in-
clined to that. The Spaniard governor told me
they could not think of shedding innocent blood:
for, as to them, the poor creatures had done no
wrong, invaded none of their property; and they
thought they had no just quarrel against them, to
take away their lives.
And here I must, in justice to these Spaniards,
observe, that, let all the accounts of Spanish
cruelty in Mexico and Peru be what they will, I
never met with seventeen men, of any nation
whatsoever, in any foreign country, who were so
universally modest, temperate, virtuous, so very
good-humoured, and so courteous, as these Spa-
niards; and, as to cruelty, they had nothing of it in
their very nature, no inhumanity, no barbarity, no
outrageous passions, and yet all of them men of
great courage and spirit.
Their temper and calmness had appeared in their
bearing the unsufferable usage of the three English-
men; and their justice and humanity appeared new
in the case of the savages, as above. After some
consultation, they resolved upon this, that they
would lie still a while longer, till, if possible, these
three men might be gone; but then the governor
Spaniard recollected that the three savages had no
boat, and that, if they were left to rove about the
island, they would certainly discover that there
were inhabitants in it, and so they should be un-
done that way.
Upon this, they went back again, and there lay
the fellows fast asleep still; so they resolved to
awaken them, and take them prisoners, and they
did so. The poor fellows were strangely frighted
when they were seized upon and bound, and afraid,
like the women, that they should be murdered
and eaten ; for, it seems, those people think all the
world do as they do, eating -men's esh; but they
were soon made easy as to that, and away they
‘carried them.
It was very happy for them, that they did not
carry them home to their castle; Lmean, to my
palace under the hill; but they carried them rst
to the bower, where was the chief of their country
work ; such as the keeping the goats, the planting
the corn, _&c. and afterwards they carried them to
the habitation of the two Englishmen.
Here they were set to work, though it was not
much they had for them to do; and, whether it was
by negligence in guarding them, or that they thought
the fellows could not mend themselves, I know not,
but one of them ran away, and, taking into the
woods, they could never hear of him more.
They had good reason to believe he got home
again soon after, in some other boats or canoes of
savages, who came on shore three or four weeks
afterwards, and who, carrying on their revels as
usual, went off again in two days’ time. This
thought terried them exceedingly; for they con-
cluded, and that not without good cause indeed,
that if this fellow got safe home among his corm
rades he would certainly give them an account that
there weiepeople in the island, as also how weak
and few they were; for this savage, as I observed
beforc,had never been told, and it was very happy he
had not, how many there were, or where they lived;
nor had he ever seen or heard the lire of any of
their guns, much less had they shown him any of
their other retired places, such as the cave in the
valley, or the new retreat, which the two English-
men had made, and the like. '
The rst testimony they had that this fellow had
given intelligence of them, was, that about two
months after this, six canoes of savages, with about
seven or eight, or ten men in a canoe, came row-
ing along the north side of the island, where they
never used to come before, and landed about an
hour after sun-rise, at a convenient place, about a
mile from the habitation of the. two Englishmen,
where this escaped man had been kept. As the
Spaniard governor said, ‘ Had they been all there,
the damage would not have been so much, for not
a man of them would have escaped.‘ But the case
differed now very much; for two men to fty, was
too much odds. The two men had the happiness
to discover them about a league o‘, so that it was
above an-hour before they landed; and, as they
landed about a mile from their huts, it was some
T
time before they could come at them. Now hav-
ing great reason to believe that they were betrayed,
the rst thing they did was to bind the two slaves
which were left, and cause two of the three men
whom they brotight with the women, who, it seems,
proved very faithful to them, to lead them with
their two wives, and whatever they could carry
away with them, to their retired place in the
woods, which I have spoken of‘ above, and there to
bind the two fellows, hand and foot, till they heard
farther.
In the next place, seeing the savages were all
come on shore, and that they bent their course di-
rectly that way, they opened the fences where the
milch-goats were kept, and drove them all out,
leaving their goats to straggle into the wood whi-
ther they pleased, that the savages might think
they were all bred wild ; but the rogue who came
with them was too cunning for that, and gave
them an account of it all; for they went directly
to the place. ~
When the two poor Frighted men _d1&<l secured
their wives and goods, they sent the other slave
they had of the three who came with the women,
and who was at their place by accident, away to
the Spaniards with all speed, to give them the
alarm, and desire speedy help; and, in the mean
time, they took their arms, and what ammunition
they had, and retreated towards the place in the
wood, where their wives were sent,_kceping at a
distance, yet so that they might see, if possible,
which way the savages took.
'1‘hey had not gone far, but that, from a rising
gronndythey could see the little army of their
enemies come on directly to their habitation, and,
in a moment more, could see all their huts and
household stuff aming up together, to their great
grief and mortication : for they had a very great
loss, to them irretrievable, at least for some time.
They kept their station for a while, till they found
the savages, like wild beasts, spread themselves all
over the place, rummaging every way and every
place they could think of, in search for prey ; and,
in particular, for the people, of whom it now plainly
appeared they had intelligence.
,.'l'he two Englishmen, seeing this, thinking them-
selves not secure where they stood, because, as it
was likely some of the wild people might come tlh
way, so they might come too many together, thought
it proper to make another retreat, about half a mile
farther, believing, as it afterwards happened, that the
farther they strolled, the fewer would be together.
The next halt was at the entrance into a very
thick-grown part of the woods, and where an old
trunk of a tree stood, which was hollow and
vastly large ; and, in this tree, they both took their
Standing, resolving to see there what might offer.
They had not stood there long, but two of the
savages appeared running directly that way, as ii’
they had already had notice where they stood, and
were coming up to attack them; and, a little way
farther, they spied three more coming after them,
and ve more beyond them, all coming the same
way; ‘besides which, they saw seven or eight more
at a distance, running another way; for, in a word,
they ran every way, like sportsmen beating for their
game.
The poor men were now in great perplexity, whe-
ther they should stand and keep their posture, or
fly. But, after a very short debate with themselves,
they considered that if the savages ranged the coun-
try thus, before help came, they might, perhaps,
nd out their retreat in the woods, and then all
would be lost; so they resolved to stand them
there; and if there were too many to deal with,
then they would get up to the top of the tree, from
whence they doubted not to defend themselves, re
excepted, as long as their ammunition lasted, though
all the savages that were landed, which were near
fty, were to attack them.
Having resolved upon this, they next considered
whether they should re at the rst two, or wait
for the three, and so take lLl1€’.*I'Dl(l(llC party; by
which the two, and the ve that followed, would
be separated. At length, they resolved to let the
rst two pass by, unless they should spy them in
the tree, and come to attack them. The rst two
savages also conrmed them in this resolution, by
turning a little from them towards another part of
the wood; but the three, and the ve after them,
came forwards directly to the tree, asif they had
known the Englishmen were there. »
Seeing them come so straight towards them, they
resolved to take them in a line as they came; and
as they resolved to re but one at a time,’ perhaps
the rst [shot might hit them all three; to which
purpose, the man who was to re, put three or four
bullets into his piece, and, having a fair loop-hole, as
it were, from a broken hole in the tree, he took a.
sure aim, without being seen, waiting till they were
‘within about thirty yards of the tree, so that he
could not miss.
While they were thus waiting, and the savages
came on,. they plainly saw, that one of the three
was the run-away savage that had escaped from
them, and they both knew him distinctly, and re-
solved that, if possible, he should not escape,
though they should both re; so the other stood
ready with his piece, that if he did not drop at the
rst shot, he should be sure to have a second.
But the rst was too good a marksman to miss his
aim; for,,,_ as the savages kept near one another, a
little behind in a line, in a word, he red, and hit
two of them directly. The foremost was killed out-
right, being shot in the head; the second, which was
the run-away Indian, was shot through the body
and fell, but was not quite dead; and the third had
a little scratch in theshoulder, perhaps by the same
ball that went-through the body of the second, and,
being dreadfully frighted, though not much hurt,
eat down upon the ground, screaming and yelling
in a hideous manner.
The ve that were behind, more frighted with
the noise, than sensible of their danger, stood still
at rst; for the woods made the sound a thou-
sand times bigger than it really was: the echoes
rattling from one side to another, and the fowls
rising from all parts, screaming and making, every
sort, a several kind of noise, according to their
kind; just as it was when I red the rst gun that,
perhaps, was ever shot o’ in that place since it was
an island.
However, all being silent again, they not know-
ing what the matter was, came on unconcern-
ed, till they came to that place where their com-
panions lay, in a condition miserable enough. And
here the poor, ignorant creatures, not sensible that
they were within reach of the same mischief, stood
all of a huddle over the wounded man, talking,
and, as may be supposed, inquiring of him how
he came to be hurt, and who, it is very rational to
believe, told them that a ash of re rst, and im-.
mediately after that, thunder from their gods, had
killed those two, and wounded him: this, I say, is
rational; for nothing is more certain than that, as
they saw no man near them, so they had never
heard a gun in their lives, or so much as heard of
0. gun, neither knew they any thing of killing or
wounding at a distance, with re and bullets; if
they had, one might reasonably believe they would
not have stood so unconcerned, in viewing the fate
of their fellows, without some apprehension of their
own.
Our two men, though, as they confessed to me, it
grieved them to be obliged to k-ill so many poor
creatures, who, at the same time, had no notion of
their danger; yet, having them all thus in their
power, and the rst having loaded his piece again,
resolved to let y both together among them ; and,
si-ngling out, by agreement, which to aim at, they
shot together, and killed, or very much wounded,
four of them; the fth, frighted even to death,
though not hurt, fell with the rest: so that our
men, seeing them all fall together, thought they had
killed them all.
The belief that the savages were all killed, made
our two men come boldly out from the tree before
they had charged their guns again, which was a
wrong step; and they were under some surprise
when th_ey came to the place, and found no less
than four of the men alive, and of them, two very
little hurt, and one not at all. This obliged them
to fall upon them with the stocks of their muskets;
and, rst, they made sure of the run-away savage,
that had been the cause of all the mischief, and of
another that was hurt in his knee, and put them
out of their pain. Then the man that was not
hurt at all came, and kneeled down to them, with
his two hands held up, and made piteous moans to
them, by gestures and signs, for his life ; but could
not say one word to them that they could under-
kstand. _
However, they signed to him to sit down at the
foot of a tree there by; and one of the Englishmen,
with a piece of rope-twine, which he had, by great
chance, in his pocket, tied his feet fast together, and
his hands behind him, and there they left him ; and,
with what speed they could, made after the other
two, which were gone‘ before, fearing they, or any
more of them, should nd the way to their co-
vered place in the woods, where their wives, and
the few goods they had left, lay. They came once
in sight of the two men, but it was at a great dis
stance. However, they had the satisfaction to see
them cross over a valley, towards the sea; the quite
_ contrary way from that which led to their retreat
which they were afraid of; and, being satised
with that} they went back to the tree where they
left their prisoner, who, as they supposed, was de-
livered by his comrades; for he was gone, and the
two pieces of rope-yarn, with which they had bound
him, layjust at the foot of the tree.
They were now in as great concern as before,
not knowing what course to take, or how near the
enemy might be, or in what numbers; so they re-
solved to go away to the place where their wives
were, to see if all was well there, and to make them
easy, who were in fright enough to be sure; for
though the savages were their own country folk,
yet they were most terribly afraid of them, and
perhaps the more, for the knowledge they had of
them.
When they came thither, they found the savages
had been in the wood, and very near the place, but
had not found it; for, indeed, it was inaccessible, by
the trees standing so thick, as be-fore, unless the
persons seeking it had been directed by those that
knew it, which these were not. They found, there-
fore, every thing vcry safe, only the women in a
terrible fright. While they were here, they had the
comfort of seven of the Spaniards coming to their
assistance; the other ten, with their servants, and
old Friday, I mean Friday’s father, were gone in a
body to defend their bower, and the corn and cat-
tle that were kept there, in case the savages should
have roved over to that side of the country; but
they did not spread so far. With the seven Spa-
niards came one of the three savages, who, as I said,
were their prisoners formerly, and with them also
came the savage whom the Englishmen had left
bound hand and foot at the tree; for it seems they
came that way, saw the slaughter of the seven men,
and unbound the eighth, and brought him along with
them: where, however, they were obliged to bind
him again, as they had done the two others, who
were left when the third ran away. .
The prisoners began now to be a burden to them ;
and they were so afraid of their escaping that they
thought they were under an absolute necessity to
kill them for their own preservation. However, the
1
A
Spaniard governor would not consent to it; but
ordered that they should be sent out of the way,
to my old cave in the valley, and be kept there, with
two Spaniards to guard them, and give them food,
which was done; and they were bound there hand
and foot for that night.
When the Spaniards came, the two Englishmen
were so encouraged, that they could not satisfy
themselves to stay any longer there ; but taking
ve of the Spaniards, and themselves, with four
muskets and a pistol among them, and two stout
quarter-staves, away they went in quest of the sa-
vages. And rst, they came to the tree where the
men lay that had been killed; but it was easy to
see, that some more of the savages had been there;
for they had attempted to carry their dead men away,
and had dragged two oi‘ them a good way, but had
given it over. From thence they advanced to the
rst rising ground, where they had stood, and seen
their camp destroyed, and where they had the mor-
tieation still to see some of the smoke; but neither
could they here see any of the savages. They
then resolved, though with all possible caution,
to go forward towards their ruined plantation.
But a little before they came thither, coming in
sight of the sea-shore, they saw plainly the savages
all embarking again in their canoes, in order to be
gone.
They seemed sorry at rst, that there was no way
to come at them, to give them a parting blow: but,
upon the whole, were very well satised to be rid
of them.
The poor Englishmen, being now twice ruined,
and all their improvements destroyed, the rest all
agreed to come and help them to rebuild, and to
assist them with needful supplies. Their three
countrymen, who were not yet noted for having
the least inclination to any good, yet, as soon
as they heard of it (for they, living remote east-
ward, knew nothing of the matter till all was over)
came and offered their help and assistance, and did
very friendly work, for several days, to restore their
habitations, and make necessaries for them; and
thus, in a little time, they were set upon their legs
again.
About two days after this, they had the farther
satisfaction of seeing three of the savages’ canoes
come driving on shore; and, at some distance from
them, with two drowned men, by which they had
reason to believe, that they had met with a storm at
sea, which had overset some of them:' for it had
blown very hard the night after they went off.
However, as some might miscarry, so, on the
other hand, enough of them escaped to inform the
rest, as ‘well of what they had done, as of what had
happened to them; and to whet them on to another
enterprise of the same nature, which they, it seems,
resolved to attempt, with sufficient force to carry
all before them; for, except what the rst man had
told them of inhabitants, they could say little to it
of their own knowledge: for they never saw one
man, and the fellow being killed that had affirm-
ed it, they had no other witness to con-rm it to
them.
It was ve or six months after this before they
heard any more of the savages, in which time our
men wcro in hopes that they had not forgot their
former bad luck, or had given over the hopes of
better; when, on a sudden, they were invaded with
a most formidable eet, of no less than twenty-
eight canoes full of savages, armed with bows and
arrows, great clubs, wooden swords, a.nd such like
engines of war; and they brought such numbers
with them, that, in short, it put all our people into
the utmost cbnsternation.
As they came on shore in the evening, and at
the easternmost side of the island, our men had that
night to consult and consider what to do; and, in
the rst place, knowing that their being entirely
concealed was their only safety before, and would
T 2
much more be so now, when the number of thein’
enemies was so great; they therefore resolved,
rst of all, to take down the two huts which were
built for the Englishmen, and drive away their
goats to the old cave; because they supposed the
savages would go directly thither, as soon as it was
day, to play the old game over again, though they
did not now land within two leagues of it.
, In the next place, they drove away all the ock
of goats they had at the old bower, as I called it,
which belonged to the Spaniards; and, in short,
left as little appearance of inhabitants any where as
possible; and the next morning early they posted
themselves, with all their force, at the plantation of
the two men, waiting for their coming. As they
guessed, so it happened: these new invaders, leav-
ing their canoes at the east end of the island, came
ranging along the shore directly towards the place,
to the number of two hundred and fty, as near as
our men could judge. Our army was but small in-
deed ; but that which was worse, they had not arms
for all their number neither. The whole account,
it-seems, stood thus: rst, as to men,
17 Spaniards.
5 Englishmen.
1 Old Friday, or Friday’s father.
3 Slaves, taken with the women, who proved
very faithful. ~
3 Other slaves who lived with the Spaniards.
To arm these they had
11 Muskets.
5 Pistols.
3 Fowling-pieces.
5 Muskets, or fowling-pieces, which were taken
by me from the mutinous seamen, whom I
reduced.
2 Swords.
3 Old halberts.
To their slaves they did not give either musket
or fusil, but they had every one a halbert, or a
long staff, like a quarter-sta’, with a great spike of
iron fastened into each end of it, and by his side
a hatchet; alsolevery one of our men had hatchets.
Two of the women could not be prevailed upon,
but they would come into the ght; and they had
bows and arrows, which the Spaniards had taken
from the savages when the rst action happened,
which I have spoken of, where the Indians fought
with one another; and the women had hatchets
too.
The Spaniard governor, whom I have described
so often, commanded the whole; and William At-
kins, who, though a dreadful fellow for wickedness,
was a most daring, bold fellow, commanded under
him. The savages came forward like lions, and
our men, which was the worst of their fate, had
no advantage in their situation; only that Will
Atkins, who now proved a most useful fellow, with
six men, was planted just-behind a small thicket of
bushes, as an advanced guard, with orders to let
the rst of them pass by, and then re into the mid.
dle of them; and, as soon as he had red, to make
his retreat as nimbly as he could, round a part of
the wood, and so come in behind the Spaniards
where they stood, having a thicket of trees all be-
fore them.
When the savages came on, they ran straggling
about every way in heaps, out of all manner of
order; and Will Atkins let about fty of them pass
by him; then seeing the rest come on in a very
thick throng, he orders three of his men to re,
having loaded their muskets with six or seven bul-
lets a piece, about as big as large pistol bullets.
How many they killed for wounded, they knew not;
but‘ the consternation and surprise was inexpressi-
ble among the savages, who were frighted to the
last degree, to hear such a dreadful noise, and see
tbeir men killed, and others hurt, but see nobody
\
that did it; when, in. the middle of their fright,
William Atkins, and his other three, let y again
among the thickest of them; and, in less than a
minute, the rst three, being loaded again, gave
them a third volley.
, Had William Atkins and his men retired imme-
diately, as soon as they had red, as they were or-
dered to do; or had the rest of the body been at
hand, to have poured in their shot continually, the
savages had been effectually routed; for the terror
that was among them came principally from this,
viz. that they were killed by the gods with thunder
and lightning, and could see nobody that hurt
them; but William Atkins, staying to load again,
discovered the cheat. Some of the savages, who
were at a distance, spying them, came upon them
behind; and though Atkins and his men red at
them also, two or three times, and killed above
twenty, retiring as fast as they could, yet they
wounded Atkins himself, and killed one of his fel-
lo‘w Englishmen with their arrows, as they did
afterwards one Spaniard, and one of the Indian
slaves who came with the women: this slave was a
most gallant fellow, and fought most desperately,
killing ve of them with his own hand, having
no weapon but one of the armed staves and a
hatchet. '
Our men being thus hard laid at, Atkins wound-
ed, and two other men killed, retreated to a rising
ground in the wood; and the Spaniards, after ring
three volleys upon them, retreated also; for their
number was so great, and they were so desperate,
that though above fty of them were killed, and
more than so many wounded, yet they came on in
the teeth of our men, fearless of danger, and shot
their arrows like a cloud ; and it was observed, that
their wounded men, who were not quite disabled,
were made outrageous by their wounds, and fought
like madmen.
When our men retreated, they left the Spaniard
and the Englishman that were killed behind them ;
and the savages, when they came up to them, kill-
ed them over again in a wretched manner, breaking
their arms, legs, and heads, with their clubs and
wooden swords, like true savages. But nding our
men were gone, they did not seem to pursue them,
but drew themselves up in a kind of a ring, which
is, it seems, their custom; and shouted twice, in
token of their victory. After which, they had the
mortication to see several of their wounded men
-fall, dying with the mere loss of blood.
The Spaniard governor having drawn his little
body up together upon a rising ground, Atkins,
though he was wounded, would have had him
march, and charge them all together at once.
But the Spaniard replied, ‘ Seignior Atkins, you
see how their wounded men ght: let them alone
till morning; all -these wounded men will be stiff
and ‘sore with their wounds, and faint with the
loss of blood, and so we shall have the fewer to
engage.
The advice was good; but Will Atkins replied
merrily, ‘That’s true, seignior, and so shall I too;
and that’s the reason I would go on while I am
warm.’ ‘ Well, seignior Atkins,’ says the Spa-
niard, ‘ you have behaved gallantly, and done your
part: we will ght for you, if you cannot come
on; but I think it best to stay till morning.’ So
they waited.
But as it was a. clear moon-light night, and they
found the savages in great disorder about their
dead and wounded men, and a great hurry and
.noise among them where they lay, they azerwards
resolved toifall upon them in the night, especially
if they could come to give them but one volley be-
fore they were discovered. This they had a fair
opportunity to do ; for one of the two Englishmen,
in whose quarter it was where the ght began, led
them round, between the woods and the sea~side,
westward, and turning short south, they came so
near where the thickest of them lay, that, before
they were seen or heard, eight of them red in
among them, and did dreadful execution upon
them. In half a minute more, eight others red
after them, pouring in their small shot in such a
quantity, that abundance were killed and wounded;
and all this while they were not able to see who
hurt them, or which way to fly.
The Spaniards charged again with the utmost ex»
pedition, and then divided themselves into three
bodies, and resolved to fall in among them all to~
gether. They had in each body eight persons;
that is to say, twenty-four, whereof were twen-
ty-two men, and the two women, who, by the way,
fought desperately.
They divided the rearms equally in each party,
and so of the halberts and staves. They would
have had the women keep back; but they said, they
were resolved to die with their husbands. Having
thus formed their little army, they marched out
from among the trees, and came up to the teeth of
the enemy, shouting and hallooing as loud as they
could. The savages stood all together, but were in
the utmost confusion, hearing the noise of our men
shouting from three quarters together. They would
have fought, if they had seen us: and as soon as
we came near enough to be seen, some arrows
were shot, and poor old Friday was wounded,
though not dangerously. But our men gave them
no time; but, running up to them, red. among
them three ways, and ‘then fell in with the butt
ends of their muskets, their swords, armed staves,
and hatchets; and laid about them so well, that,
in a word, they set up a dismal screaming and
howling, ying to save their lives which way soever
they could.
Our men were tired with the execution; and
killed, or mortally wounded, in the two ghts,
about one hundred and eighty of them; the rest,
being frighted out of their wits, scoured through
K
the woods, and over the hills, with all the speed
and fear that nimble feet could help them to do;
and as our men did not trouble themselves much to
pursue them, they got all together to the sea-side
where they landed, and where their canoes lay.
But their disaster was not at an end yet; for it
blew a terrible storm of wind that evening from the
sea-ward, so that it was impossible for them to put
o’; nay, the storm continuing all night, when the
tide came up, their canoes were most of them driven
by the surge of the sea so high upon the shore, that
it required innite toil to get them off; and some
of them were even dashed to pieces against the
beach, or against one another.
Our men, though glad of their victory, yet got
little rest that night; but having refreshed them-
selves as well as they could, they resolved to march
to that pa-rt of the island where the savages were
ed, and see what posture they were in. This ne-
cessarily led them over the place where the ght
had been, and where they found several of the poor
creatures not quite dead, and yet past recovering
1-ife: a sight disagreeable enough to generous minds;
for a truly great man, though obliged by the law of
battle to destroy his enemy, takes -no delight in his
misery-.
However, there was no need to give any order in
this ease, for their own savages, who were their
servants, dispatched those poor creatures with their
hatchets.
At length they came in view of the place where
the more miserable remains of the savages’ army
lay, where_ there appeared about one hundred still:
their posture was generally sitting upon the ground,
with their knees up towards their mouth, and the
head put between the hands, leaning down upon
the knees.
When our men came within two musket shot
of them, the Spaniard governor ordered two mus-
kets to be red, without ball, to alarm them: this
he did, that, by their countenance, he might know-
what to expect; viz. whether they were still in heart
to ght, or were so heartily beaten, as to be dis-
pirited and discouraged, and so he might "manage
accordingly. '
This stratagem took ; for, as soon as the savages
heard the rst gun, and saw the ash of the second,
they started up upon their feet in the greatest con-
sternation imaginable: and, as our men advanced
swiftly towards them, they all ran screaming and
yawling away, with a kind of a howling noise, which
our men did not understand, and had never heard
before; and thus they ran up the hills into the
country. ,
l At rst, our men had much rather the weather
had been calm, and they had all gone away to sea;
but-they didnot then consider, that this might pro-
bably have been the occasion of their coming again
in such multitudes as not to be resisted, or at least
to come so many, and so often, as would quite de-
solate the island, and starve them. Will Atkins,
therefore, who, notwithstanding his wound, kept
always with them, proved the best counsellor in this
case: his advice was, to take the advantage that
offered, and clap in between them and their
boats, and so deprive them of the capacity of ever
returning any more to plague the island.
They consulted long about this, and some were
against it, for fear of making the wretches y to
the woods, and live there desperate; and so they
should have‘ them to hunt like wild beasts, be
afraid to stir out about their business, and have
their plantations continually rilied, all their tame
goats destroyed, and, in short, be reduced to a life
of continual distress. "
Will Atkins told them they had better have to do
with one hundred men, than with one hundred na-
tions; that as they must destroy their boats, so they
must destroy the men, or be all of them destroyed
themselves. In a word, he showed them the ne-
cessity of it so plainly, that they all came into it ;. so
they went to work immediately with the boats, and,
getting some dry wood together from a dead tree,
they tried to set some of them on re; but they
were so wet that they would not burn. However,
the re so burned the upper part, that it soon made
them unlit for swimming in the sea as boats. When
the Indians saw what they were about, some of
them came running out of the woods, and coming
as near as they could to our men, kneeled down
and cried, ‘ Qa! oa! waramokoa!’ and some other
words of their language, which none of the others
understood any thing of; but as they made piti-
ful gestures, and strange noises, it was easy to
understand, they begged to have their boats spared
and that they would be gone, and never come thither
again.
But our men were now satised that they had no
way to preserve themselves, or to save their colony,
but effectually to prevent any of these people from
ever going home again; depending upon this, that
if ever so much as one of them got back into
their country to tell the story, the colony was un-
done: so that letting them know that they should
not have any mercy, they fell to work with their
canoes, and destroyed them every one, that the
storm had not destroyed before. At the sight of
which the savages raised a hideous cry in the
woods, which our people heard plain enough ; after
which they ran about the island like distracted
men; so that, in a word, our men did not really
know at rst what to do with them.
Nor did the Spaniards, with all their prudence,
consider that while they made those people thus
desperate, they ought to have ‘kept good guard at
the same time upon their plantations; for though
it is true, they had driven away their cattle, and the
Indians did not nd out their main retreat, Imean
my old castle at the hill, nor the cave in the valley;
yet they found out my plantation at the bower,
and pulled it all to pieces, and all the fences and
planting about it; trod all the corn under foot;
tore up the vines, and grapes being just then al-
most ripe; and did our men an inestimable damage,
though to themselves not one farthing’s worth of
service. ‘ .
Though our men were able to ght them upon
all occasions, yet they were in no condition to pur-
sue them, or hunt them up.and down; for as they
were too nimble of foot for our men, when they
found them single, so our men durst not go about
single, for fear of being surrounded with their num-
bers. The best was, they had no weapons; for
though they had bows, they had no arrows left, nor
any materials to make any, nor had they any edged
tool or weapon among them.
The extremity and distress they were reduced to
was great, and, indeed, deplorable; but, at the same
time our men were also brought to very hard cir-
cumstances by them: for though their retreats
were preserved, yet their provision was destroyed,
and their harvest spoiled; andwhat to do, or which
way to turn themselves, they knew not. The only
refuge they had now, was, the stock of cattle they
had in the valley by the cave, and some little corn
which grew there, and- the plantation of the three
Englishmen, William Atkins and his comrades;
who were now reduced to two, one of them being
killed by an arrow, which struck him on the side of
his head, just under the temple, so that he never
spoke more; and it was very remarkable, that this
was the same barbarous fellow who cut the poor
savage slave with his hatchet, and who afterwards
intended to have murdered the Spaniards.
I looked upon their case to have been worse at
this time, than mine was at any time, after I rst
discovered the grains of barley and rice, and got
into the method of planting and raising my corn,
and my tame ‘cattle; for now they had, "as I may
say-, a hundred wolves upon the island, which would
devour every thing they could come at, yet could
be very hardly come at themselves. "
The rst thing they concluded, when they saw
what their circumstances were, was, that they
would, if possible, drive them up to the farther
part of the island, south-east, that if any more sap
vages came on shore, they might not nd one an-
other; then, that they would daily hunt and ha-
rass them, and kill as many of them as they could
come at, till they had reduced their number; and
if they could at last tame them, and bring them
to any thing, they would give them corn, and
teach them how to plant and live upon their daily
labour.
In order to this, they so followed them, and so
terried them with their guns, that, in a few days,
if any of them red a gun at an Indian, if he did
not hit him, yet he would fall down for _fear; and
so dreadfully frighted they were, that they kept
out of sight farther and farther, till at last our men
following them, and every day almost killing and
wounding some of them, they kept up in the woods
and hollow places so much, that it reduced them to
the utmost misery for want of food; and many
were afterwards found dead in the woods, without
any hurt, but merely starved to death.
When our men found this, it made their hearts
relent, and pity moved them ; especially the Spa-
niard governor, who was the most gentlemanly,
generous-minded man that ever I met with in my
life. And he proposed, if possible, to take one of
them alive, and bring him to understand what they
meant, so far as to be able to act as interpreter,
and to go among them, and see if they might be
brought to some conditions, that might be depend-
ed upon to save their lives, and do us no spoil.
It was some time before any of them could be
taken; but being weak and half starved, one of
them was at last ‘surprised, and made a prisoner.
He was sullen at rst. and would neither eat nor
drink; but, nding himself kindly used, and victu-ale
given him, and no violence offered him, he at last
grew tractable, and came to himself.
They brought old Friday to him, who talked often
with him, and told him how kind the others would
be to them all; that they would not only save
their lives, but would give them a part of the island
to live in, provided they would give satisfaction
that they would keep in their own bounds, and not
eome beyond them to injure or prejudice others;
and that they should have corn given them, to plant
and make it grow for their bread, and some bread
given them for their present subsistence; and old
Friday bade the fellow go and talk with the rest of
his countrymen, and see what they said to it, as-
suring them, that if they did not agree immediately
they should all be destroyed.
The poor wretches, thoroughly humbled, and re-
duced in number to about thirty-seven, closed with
the proposal at the rst offer, and begged to have
some food given them; upon which twelve Spa-
niards, and two Englishmen, well armed, and three
Indian slaves, and old Friday, marched to the place
where they were. The three Indian slaves carried
them a large quantity of bread, and some rice boiled
up to cakes, and dried in the sun, and three live
goats ; and they were ordered to go to the side of
a hill, where they sat down, eat the provisions
very thankfully, and were the most faithful fellows
to their words that could be thought of; for, ex-
cept when they came to beg vietuals and directions,
they never ‘came out of their bounds; and there
they lived when 1 came to the island, and Iwent
to see them.
They had taught them both to plant corn, make
bread, breed tame goats, and milk them. They
wanted nothing but wives, and they soon would
have been a nation. They were conned to a neck
of land, surrounded with high rocks behind them,
end lying plain towards the sea before them, on
the south-cast corner of the island. They had land
enough, and it was very good and fruitful; for
they had a piece of land about a mile and half
broad, and three or four miles in length.
Our men taught them to make wooden spades,
such as I made for myself; and gave them among
them twelve hatchets, and three or four knives;
and there they lived the most subjected, innocent
creatures that ever were hoard of.
After this, the colony euioyed a perfect tranquil-
lity, with respect to the savages, till I came to rc-
visit them, which was in about two years: not but
that now and then some canoes of savages came on
shore for their triumphal unnatural feasts; but as
they were of several nations, and, perhaps, had
never heard of those that came before, or the rea-
son of it, they didnot make any search or inquiry
after their countrymen; and if they had, it would
have been very hard for them to have found them
out.
Thus, I think-, I have given a full account of all
that happened to them, to my return, at least, that
was worth notice. The Indians, or savages, were
wonderfully civilized by them, and they frequently
went among them; but forbid, on pain of death,
any of the Indians coming to them, because they
would not have their settlement betrayed again.
One thing was very remarkable, viz. that they
taught the savages to make wicker-work, or bas-
kets; but they soon outdid their masters; for
they made abundance of most ingenious things in
wicker-work, particularly all sorts of baskets, sieves,
bird-cages, cupboards, &c.; as also chairs to sit on,
stools, beds, couches, and abundance of other
things, being very ingenious at such work, when
they were once put in the way of it.
My coming was a particular relief to these peo-
ple, because we furnished them with knives, scissars,
spades, shovels, pick-‘axes, and all things of that
kind which they could want.‘
With the help of these tools they were so very
handy, that they came, at last, to build up their
huts, or houses, very handsomely; raildling, or
working it up, like baskct~work, all the way round,
which was a very extraordinary piece of ingenuity,
and looked very odd; but was an exceeding good
fence, as well against heat, as against all sorts of
vermin : and-our men were so ta-ken with it, that
they got the wild savages to come and do the like
for them; so that when I came to see the two Eng-
lishmen’s colonies, they looked, at a distance, as if
they lived all like bees in a hive ; and as for Will
Atkins, who was now become a very industrious,
necessary, and sober fellow, he had made himself
such _a tent of basket-work, as I believe was never
seen; it was one hundred and twenty paces round
the outside, as I measured by my steps; the walls
were as close-worked as a basket, in pannels, or
squares, thirty-two in number, and very strong,
standing about seven feet high. In the middle was
another, not above twenty-two paces round, but
built stronger, being eight-square in its form, and
in the eight corners stood eight very strong posts,
round the top of which he laid strong pieces, joined
together with wooden pins, from which he rais-
ed a pyramid for the roof, of eight rafters, very
handsome, 1 assure you, and joined together very
well, though he had no nails, and only a few iron
spikes, which he had made himself too, out of the
old iron that I had left there; and, indeed, this
fellow showed abundance ,of ingenuity in several
things which he had no knowledge of. I-Ie. made
himself a forge, with a pair of wooden bellows to
blow the re. I-Ie made himself charcoal for his
work, and he formed, out of one of the iron crows,
a middling good anvil, to hammer upon. In this
manner he made many things, but especially
hooks, staples, and spikes, bolts and hinges. But
to return to the house: after he had pitched
the roof of his innermost tent, he worked it up
between the rafters with basket-work, so rm, and
thatched that over again» so ingeniously with
rice straw, and over that a large leaf of a tree,
which covered the top, that his house was as
dry as if it had been tiled or slated. Indeed,
he owned, that the savages made the basket-work
for him. _
The outer circuit was covered, as a lean-to, all
round this inner apartment, and long rafters lay
from the thirty-two angles to the top posts of the
inner house, being about twenty feet distant; so that
there was a space like a walk, within the outer
wicker-wall, and without the inner, near twenty
feet wide. i
The inner place he partitioned o" with the same
wicker-work, but much fairer, and divided it into
six apartments, so that he had six rooms on a
oor, and out of every one of - these there was a
door; rst, into the entry or coming into the main
tent, and another door into the space, or walk, that
was round it; so that this walk was also divided
into six equal parts, which served not only for re~
treat, but to.store up any necessaries which the
family had occasion for. These six spaces not tak-
ing up the whole circumference, what other apart-
ments the outer circle had were thus ordered: as
soon as you were in at the door of the outer
circle, you had a short passage straight before you
to the door of the inner house; but, on either side,
was a wicker partition, and a door in it, by which
you went, rst, into a large room, or storehouse,
twenty feet wirle, and about thirty feet long, and
-through that into another not quite so long; so
that in the outer circle were ten handsome rooms,
six of which were only to be come at through the
apartments of the inner tent, and served as closets,
or retiring rooms, to the respective chambers of the
inner circle; and four large warehouses, or barns,
or what you please to call them, which went in
through one another, two on either hand of the
passage, that led through the outer door to the in-
ner tent.
Such a piece of basket-work, I believe, was never
seen in‘ the world; nor a house, or tent, so neatly
contrived, much less so built. In this great bee-hive
lived the three families; that is to say, Will Atkins,
and his companion: the third was killed, but his
wife remained with three children, for she was, it
seems, big with child when he died ; and the other
two were not at all backward to give the widow
her full share of every thing; I mean as to their
corn, milk, grapes, 8:0. and when they killed a kid,
or found a turtle on the shore; so they all lived
well enough, though it was true, they were not so
industrious as the other two, as has been observed
already.
One thing, however, cannot be omitted, viz. that
as for religion, I do not know that there was any
thing of that kind among them: they pretty often,
indeed, put one another in mind, that there was a
God, by the very common method of seamen, viz.
swearing by his name. Nor were their poor, igno-
rant, savage wivcs much the better for having been
married to Christians, as we must call them; for as
they knew very little of God themselyes, so they
were utterly incapable of entering into any dis-
course with their wives about a God, or to talk any
thing to them concerning religion.
The utmost of all the improvement which I can
say the wives had made from them, was, that they
had taught them to speak English pretty well; and
all the children they had, which were near twenty
in all, were taught to speak English too, from their
rst learning to speak, though they at rst spoke it
in avery broken manner, like their mothers. There
were none of those children above six years’ old
when I came thither; for it was not much above
seven years that they had fetched these ve savage
ladies over; but they had all been pretty fruitful,
fbr they had all children, more or less. I think the
eoolc s mate's wife was Big of her sixth child ; and
the mothers were all a good sort of well-governed,
quiet, laborious women, modest and decent, help-
ful to one another, mighty observant and subject to
their masters, I cannot call them husbands; and
wanted nothing but to be well instructed in the
Christian religion, and to be legally married, both
which were happily brought about afterwards by
my means, or, at least, in consequence of my com-
ing among them. "
Having thus given an account of the colony in
general, and pretty much of 1ny,ve runagate
Englishmen, I must say something of the Spa-
niards, who were the-main body of the family, and
in whose story there are some incidents also re-
markable enough.
l had a great many discourses with them about
their circumstances, when they were among the
savages. They told me readily, that they had no
instances to give of their application or ingenuity
in that country; that they were a poor, miserable,
dejected handful of people; that if means had been
put into their hands, they had yet so abandoned
themselves to despair, and so sunk under the
weight of their misfortunes, that they thought of
nothing but starving. One of them-, a grave and
very sensible man, told me, he was convinced they
were in the wrong; that it was not the part of
wise men to give up themselves to their misery,
but ./always to take hold of the helps which rea-
son offered, as well for present support, as for Tu-
ture deliverance. He told me that grief was the
most senseless, insignicant passion in the world;
for that it regarded only things past, which were
generally impossible to be recalled or to be reme-
died, but had no view to things to come, and had
no share in any thing that looked like deliverance,
but rather added to the aliction, than proposed a
remedy: and, upon this, he repeated a Spanish pro-
verb, Wlrleh, though I cannot repent in just the
U
same words that he spoke it, yet I remember I
made it into an English proverb of my own thus:
In trouble to be troubled,
Is to have your trouble doubled.
He ran on, then, in remarks upon all the little
improvements I had made in my solitude; my un-
weariod application, as he called it; and how I had
made a condition, which, in its circumstances, was,
at rst, much worse than theirs, a thousand times
more happy than theirs was, even now, when they
were all together. Ile told me, it was remark-
able, that Englishmen had a greater presence of
mind in their distress, than any people that ever
he met with; that their unhappy nation, and the
Portuguese, were the worst men in the world to
struggle with misfortunes; for that their rst step
in dangers, after the common efforts are over, was
always to despair, lie down under it and die,without
rousing their thoughts up to proper remedies for
escape.
I told him, their case and mine differed exceed-
ingly ; that they were cast upon the shore without
1l6C0$S3.l‘l6j3,, without supply of food, or of present
sustenance, till they could provide it. That it is
true, I had this disadvantage and discomfort, that
I was alone; but then the supplies I had providen-
tially thrown into my hands, by the unexpected
driving of the ship on shore, was such a help as
would have encouraged any creature in the world
to have applied himself as I had done. ‘ Sei-
gnior,’ says the Spaniard, ‘ had we poor Spaniards
been in your case, we should never have gotten half
those things ou_t of the ship as you did; nay,’ says
he, ‘ we should never have found means to have
gotten a raft to carry them, or to have gotten a raft
on shore without boat or sail; and how much less
should we have done,’ said he, ‘ if any of us had
been alone!’ Well, I desired him to abate his
compliment, and go on with the history of their
coming on shore, where they lauded. I-Ie told me,
they unhappily landed at a place where there were
people without provisions; whereas, had they had
the common sense to have put oil‘ to sea again, and
gone to another island a little farther, they had
found provisions, though without people; there
being an island that way, as they had been told,
where there were provisions, though no people;
that is to say, that the Spaniards of Trinidad had
frequently been there, and had lled the island with
goats and hogs at several times, where they have
bred in such multitudes, and where turtle and sea.
fowls were in such plenty, that they could have
been in no want of flesh, though they had found
no bread; whereas here they were only sustained
with a few roots and herbs, which they understood
not, and which had no substance in them, and
which the inhabitants gave them sparingly enough,
and who could treat them no better, unless they
would turn eannibals, and eat men's esh, which
was the great dainty of their country.
They gave me an account how many ways they
strove to eivilize the savages they were with, and
to teach them rational customs in the ordinary
way of living, but in vain; and how they retorted
it upon them, as unjust, that they who came thi-
ther for assistance and support, should attempt to
set up for instructors of those that gave them
bread ; intimating, it seems, that none should set up
for the instructors of others, but those who could
live without them.
They gave me dismal accounts of the extremities
they were driven to; how sometimes they were
many days without any food at all; the islan-l they
were upon being inhabited by a sort of savages
that lived more indolent, and, for that reason, were
less supplied with the necessaries of lite, than they
had reason to believe others were in the same part
of the world; and yet they found that these savages
were less ravenous and voracious, than those who
had better supplies of food.
Also they added, that they could not but see
with what demonstrations of wisdom and goodness
the ggoverning providence of God directs the events
of things in the'w0rld, which, they said, appeared
in their circumstances; for, if pressed by the hard-
ships they were under, and the barrenness of the
country where they were, they had searched after a
better place to live in, they had then been out of
the way of the relief that happened to them by my
means. i
Then they gave ‘me an account how the savages,
whom they lived among, expected them to go out
with them i-nto their wars. And it was true, that,
as. they had rre-arms with them, had they not had
the disaster to lose their ammunition, they should
not have been serviceable only to their friends, but
have made themselves terrible both to friends and
enemies. But being without powder and shot, and
yet i-n a condition, that they could not in reason
deny to go out with their landlords to their wars;
when they came into the eld of battle, they were
in a worse condition than the savages themselves;
for they had neither bows nor arrows, nor could
they use those the savages gave them, so that they
could do nothing but stand still, and be wounded
with arrows, till they came up to the teeth of their
enemy; and then, indeed, the th-reehalberts they
had were "of use to them; and they would often
drive a whole little army before them, with those
halberts and sharpened sticks put into the muzzles
of their muskets. But that, for all this, they were
sometimes surrounded with multitudes, and in
great danger from their arrows; till at last they
found the way to make themselves large targets
of wood, which they covered with skins of wild
beasts, whose names they knew not, and these co-
vered them from the arrows of the savages: that,
notwithstanding these, they were sometimes in
great danger, and were once live of them knocked
down together, with the clubs of the savages,
which was the time when one of them was taken
prisoner, that is to say, the Spaniard whom I
had relieved: that at rst they thought he had
been killed, but when afterwards they heard he was
taken prisoner, they were under the greatest grief
imaginable, and would willingly have all ventured
their lives to have rescued him.
They told me that when they were so knocked
down, the rest of their company rescued them, and
stood over them, ghting till they were come to
themselves, all but he who they thought had been
dead; and then they made their way, with their
halberts and pieces, standing close together in a.
line, through a body of above a thousand savages,
beating down all that came in their way, got the
victory over their enemies, but, to their great sor-
row, because it was with the loss of their friend,
whom the other party, nding him alive, carried
o’, with some others, as I gave an account in the
former part of my life.
They described most aifectingly how they were
surprised with joy at the return of their friend
and companion in misery, who they thought had
been devoured by wild beasts of the worst kind,
viz. by wild men; and yet h/ow more and more
they were surprised with the account he gave
them of his errand, and that there was a Christian
in any place near, much more one that was able,
and had humanity enough to contribute to their
deliverance. I
They described how they were astonished at the
sight of the relief 1 sent them, and at the appear-
ance of loaves of bread, things they had not seen
since their coming to that miserable place; how
often they crossed it, and blessed it, as bread sent
from heaven; and what a reviving cordial it was
to their spirits to taste it: as also of the other
things I had sent for their supply. And, after all,
1
they would have told me something of the joy they
were in, at the sight of a boat and pilots to carry
‘them away to the person and place, from whence
all these new comforts came; but they told me it
was impossibleto express it by words; for their
excessive joy naturally driving them to unbecoming
extravagances, they had no way to describe them,
but by telling me that they bordered upon lunacy,
having no way to givevent to their passion suit-
able to ‘the sense that was upon them ; that in some
it worked one way, and in some another; and
that some of them, through a surprise of joy, would
burst out into tears; others be hall‘ mad, and
others immediately faint. This discourse extremely
a*ected me, and called to my mind Friday’s ec-
stasy when he met his father, and the poor peo-
ple’s ecstasy when I took them up at sea, after
their ship was on re; the master of the ship’s joy,
when he found himself delivered in the place where
he expected to perish; and my own joy, when,
-after twenty-eight years’ captivity, I found a good
"leave others, who, perhaps, would be unwilling to
ship ready to carry me to my own country. All
these things made me more sensible of the rela-
tion of these poor men, and more aected with it.
Having thus given a view of the state of things,
as I found them, I must relate the heads oi’ what I
did for these people; and the condition in which I
left them. It was their opinion, and mine too, that
they would be troubled no more with the savages;
or that, if they were, they would be able to out
them off, if they were twice as many as before: so
that they had no concern about that. Then I en-
tered into a serious discourse with the Spaniard,
whom I called governor, about their stay in the
island; for, as I was not come to carry any of them
off, solit would not be just -to carry off some, and
stay, if their strength was diminished.
On the other hand, 1 told them, I came to esta-
blish them there, not to remove them; and then I
let them know, that I had. brought with me relief
of sundry kinds for them; that I had been at a.
great charge to supply them with all things neces-
sary, as well for their convenience, as their cle-
fence ; and that.I had such and such particular per-
sons with me, 'as well to increase and recruit their
number, as by the particular necessary ernployments
which they were bred to, being articers, to assist
them in those things, in which, at present, they
were to seek.
They were all together,.when I talked thus to
them; and before I delivered to them the stores I
had brought, I asked them, one by one, if they had
entirely forgot and buried the rst animosities that
had been among them, and would shake hands with
one another, and engage in a- strict friendship and
union of interest, so that there might be no more
misunderstandings or jealousies.
William Atkins, with abundance of frankness and
good-humour, said they had met with aiictions
enough to make them all sober, and enemies enough
to make them all friends; that, for his part, he
would live and die with them: and was so far from
designing any thing against the Spaniards, that, he
owned, they had done nothing to him but what his
own mad humour made necessary, and what he
would have done, and perhaps much worse, in
their case; and that he would ask them pardon, if
I desired it, for the foolish and brutish things he
had done to them; and was very willing and de-
sirous of living in terms of entire friendship and
union with them ; and would do any thing that lay
in his power to convince them of it. And as for
going to England, he cared not if he did not go
thither these twenty years.
The Spaniards said they had, indeed, at rst, dis-
armed and excluded William Atkins and his two
countrymen, for their ill conduct, as they had let
me know: and they all appealed to me, for the ne-
cessityp they were under to do so. But that Wil-
l-iam Atkins had behaved himself so bravely in the
great ght they had with the savages, and, on seve-
ral occasions since, and had showed himself so
faithful to, and concerned for, the general interest
of them all, that they had forgotten all -that was
past, and thought he merited as much to be trusted
with arms, and supplied with necessaries, as any
of them; and that they had tcstied their satisfac-
tion in him, by committing the command to him,
next to the governor himself. And as they had an
entire -confidence in him and all his countrymen,
so they acknowledged they had merited that con-
fidence, by all the methods that honest men could
merit to be valued and trusted. And they most
heartily embraced the occasion/ol’lgiving me this
assurance, that they would never have any interest
separate from one another.
Upon these frank and open declarations of friend-
ship, we appointed the next day to dine all toge-
ther; and, indeed, we made a splendid feast. I
caused the ship’s cook, and his mate, to come on
shore,'and dress our dinner; and the old cook's
mate we had on shore assisted. We-brought on
shore six pieces of good beef, and four pieces of
pork, out of the ship’s provision, with our punch-
bowl, and materials to ll it; and, in parti<;ul.1r, I.
gave them ten bottles of French claret, and ten
bottles of English beer; things that neither the
Spaniards, nor the Islnglishmen, had tasted for many
years; and which, it may be supposed, they were
exceedingly glad of.
The Spaniards added to our feast ve whole
kids, which the cooks roasted; and three of them
were sent, covered up close, on board the ship, to
the seamen, that they might feast on fresh meat
from on shore, as we did with their salt meat from
on board.
After this feast, at which we were very inno-
cently merry, I brought out my cargo of goods,
whc-rein, that there might be no dispute about di~
vlding, I showed them there was sufficient for them
all; and desired that they might all take an equal
quantity of the goods that were for wearing ; that
is to say, equal when made up. As rst, I distri-
buted linen sufficient to make every one of them
four shirts; and, at the Spaniards’ request, after-
wards made them up six. These were exceeding
comfortable to them, having been what, as I may
say, they had long since forgot the use of, or what
it was to wear them.
I allotted the thin English stuffs, which I men-
tioned before, to make every one a light coat, like
a frock, which I judged ttest for the heat of the
season, cool and loose; and ordered, that, when-
ever they decayed, they should make more, as they
thought t: the like for pumps, shoes, stockings,
hats, &c. p
I cannot express what pleasure, what satisfac-
tion, sat upon the eountenances of all these poor
men, when they saw the care I had taken of them,
and how well I had furnished them. They told
me, I was a father to them, and that, having such
a correspondent as I was, in so remote a part of the
world, it would make them forget that they were
left in a desolate place. And they all voluntarily
engaged to me, not to leave the place without my
consent.
Then I presented to them the people I had br.oup;ht
with me, particularly the tailor, the smith, and the
two carpenters, all of them most necessary people;
but, above all, my general artiiicer, than whom
they could not name any thing that was more
useful to them. And the tailor, to show his con-
cern for them, went to work immediately, and,
with my leave, made them every one a shirt the
rst thing he did; and, which was still more, he
taught the women not only how to sew and
stitch, and use the needle, but made them assist
to make the shirts for their husbands, and for all the
ICSI.
U Q
As to the carpenters, I scarce need mention how
useful they were; for they took in pieces all my
clumsy, unhandy things, and made them clever;
convenient tables, stools, bedsteads, cupboards,
lockers, shelves, and every thing they wanted of
thatkind.
But, to let them see how nature made articers
at first, I carried the carpenters to see William
Atkins’s basket-house, as I called it; and they both
owned they never saw an instance of such natural
ingenuity before ; nor any thing so regular, and so
handily built, at least of its kind. And one ‘of
them, when he saw it, after musing a good while,
turning about to me, ‘ I am sure,’ says he, ‘ that
man has no need of us: you need do nothing but
give him tools.’
Then I brought the-in out all..my store of tools,
and gave every man a digging-spade, a shovel, and
a rake, for~we had no harrows or ploughs; and
to every separate place a pick-axe, a crow, a broad
axe, and a saw, always appointing, that as often as
any were broken or worn out, they should be sup-
plied, without grudging, out of the general stores
that I left behind. '
Nails, staples, hinges, hammers. chisols, knives,
scissars, and all sorts of tools and iron-work, they
had without tale, as they required; for no man
would care to take more than he wanted; and
he must be a fool that would waste or spoil them,
on any account whatever. And, for the use of the
smith, I left two tons of unwrought iron for a
supply.
My magazine of powder and arms, which I
brought them, was such, even to profusion, that
they could not but rejoice at them; for now they
could march, as I used to do, with a musket upon
each shoulder, if there was occasion, and were
nhlc to ght a thousand savages, if they had but
some little advantages of situation, which also tliey
could not miss of ifthey hz-id occasion.
I carried on shore with me the young man, whose
mother was starved to death, and the maid also.
She was at sober, well educated, religious young
woman, and behaved so inoffensi-vely, that every
one gave her a good word. She had, indeed, an
unhappy life with us, there being no woman in the
ship but herself; but she bore it with patience.
After at while, seeing things so well ordered, and
in so ne a way of thriving, upon my island; and
considering that they had neither business nor ac-
quaintance in the East Indies, or reason for taking
so long avoyage; I say, considering all this, both
ol’ thun came to me, and desired l would give them
leave to remain on the island, and be entered among
my family, as they called it.
I agreed to it readily; and they had a little plat
of ground allotted to them-, where they had three
tents, or houses, set up, surrounded with a basket-
work, palisadoed like Atkins's, and adjoining to his
plaml;2l.l'.i0l\. ’1'heir tents were contrived so, that
they had each of them a room apart to lodge in,
and a middle tent, like a great storehouse, to lay
all their goods in, and to-eat and drink in. And
now the other two Englislnnen removed their ha-
bitation to the same place; and so the island was
divided into three colonies, and no more; viz. the
Spaniards, with old Friday, and the rst servants,
at my old habitation under the hill, which was, in
a word, the capital city, and where they had so en~
llu-ged and extended their works, as well under, as
on the outside of the hill, that they lived, though
perfectly concealed, yet full at large. Never was
there such a little city in a wood, and so hid, I b<>,.
lieve, in any part of the world: for I verily he-
lieve, a thousand men might have ranged the
island a month, and, if they had not known there
was such a thing, and looked on purpose for it,
they would not have found it; for the trees stood
so thick, and so close, and grew so fast matted into
one another, that nothing but cutting them down
rst, could discover the place; except the two nar-
row entrances, where they went in and out, could
be found, which was not very easy: one of them
was just down at the water’s edge, on the side of
the creek, and it was afterwards above two hundred
yards to the place ; and the other was up the lad-
der at twice, as I have already formally described
it; and they had a large wood, thick planted also,
on the top of the hill, which contained above an
acre", which grew apace, and covered the place from
all discovery tliere, with only one narrow place be-
tween two trees, not easy to be discovered, to en-
ter on that side. -
The other colony was that of Will ALkins’s§ where
there were four families of Englishmen, I mean
those I had left there, ‘with their wives and child-
ren; three savages, that were slaves; the widow
and children of the Englishman that was killed;
the young man and the maid, and, by the way, we
made a wife of her also, before we went away.
There were also the two carpenters and the tailor,
whom I brought with me for them; also the smith,
who was -a very necessary man to them, especially
as a gunsmith, to take care of their arms; and
my other man, whom I called ‘ Jack of all trades,’
who was in himself,'as good almost as twenty men;
for he was not only a very ingenious fellow, but
a very merry fellow; and, before I went away, we
married him to the honest maid that came with the
youth in the ship I mentioned before.
And now I speak of ma1‘1'ying, it brings me na-
turally to say something of the French ecclesiastie
that I had brought with me out of the ship’s crew,
whom I took up at sea. It is true, this man was a
Roman, and, perhaps, it may give offence to some
hereafter, if I leave any thing extraordinary upon
record of a man whom, before I begin, I must (to
set him out in just colours) represent in terms
very much to his disadvantage, in the account of
protestants; as rst, that he was a papist; se-
condly, a popish priest; and, thirdly, a. French po-
pish priest.
But justice demands of me to give him a due
character: and I must say, he was a grave, sober,
pious, and most religious person; exact in his life,
extensive in his charity, and exemplary in almost
every thing he did. What, then, can any one say
against my being very sensible of the value of such
a man, notwithstanding his profession; though it
may be my opinion perhaps, as well as the opi-
nion of others, who shall read this, that he was
mistaken. _
The rst hour that I began to converse with him,
after he had agreed to go with me to the East
Indies, I found reason to delight exceedingly in
his conversation. And he rst began with me,
about religion, in the most obliging manner ima-
ginable.
‘ Sir,’ says he, ‘ you have not only, under God
(and at that he crossed his breast) saved my life,
but you have admitted me to go this voyage in your
ship; and, by your obliging civility. have taken me
into your family, giving me an opportunity of free
conversation. Now, sir,’ says he, ‘you see by my
habit, what my profession is, and I guess, by your
nation, what yours is. I may think it is my duty,
and doubtless it is so, to use my utmost endea-
vours, on all occasions, to bring all the souls that I
can to the knowledge of the truth, and to embrace
the catholic doctrine; but, as I am here under
your permission, and in your family, I am bound, in
justice to your kindness, as well as in decency and
good manners, to be under your government; and,
therefore, I shall not, without your leave, enter
into any debates on the points of religion, in which
we may not agree, farther than you shall give me
leave.’
I told him his carriage was so modest, that I
could not but acknowledge it; that it was true, we
were such people as they called heretics, but that
he was not the rst catholic that I had convcrsed
with, without falling into any inconveniences, or
carrying the questions to any height in debate;
that he should not nd himself the worse used
for being of a ditl'erent opinion from us; and if
we did not converse without any dislike on either
side upon that score, it would be his fault, not
ours. -
= He replied, that he thought all our conversation
might be easily separated from disputes; that it was
not his business to cap principles with every man he
discoursed with; and that he rather desired me to
converse with him as a gentleman, than as a reli-
gieux; that if I would give him leave, at any time,
to discourse upon religious subjects, he would
readily comply with it; and that then he did not
doubt but I would allow him also to defend his
own opinions as well as he could; but that, without
my leave, he would not break in upon me with any
such thing.
He told me farther, that he would not cease to
do all that became him in his oflice as a priest, as
well as a private Christian, to procure the good of
the ship, and the safety of all that was in her; and
though, perhaps, we would not join with him, and
he could not pray with us,‘he hoped he might pray
for us, which he would do upon all occasions. In
this manner we conversed ; and, as he was of a
most obliging gentlcmanlike behaviour, so he was,
ifl may be allowed to say so, a man ol’ good sense,
and, as I believe, of great learning.
He gave me a most diverting account of his life,
and of the many extraordinary events ol’ it; of
the many adventures which had befallcn him in the
few years that he had been abroad in the world,
and particularly this was very remarkable; viz. that
during the voyage he was now engaged in, he had
had the misfortune to be ve times shipped and un-
shipped, and never to go to the place whither any
of the ships he was in, was at rst designed : that
his rst intent was to have gone to Martinico, and
that he went on board a ship bound thither, at St»
Malo; but being forced into Lisbon by bad weather,
the ship received some damage, by running aground
in the mouth of the river Tagns, and was obliged
to u-nload her cargo there; that nding a Portu-
guese ship there, bound to the Madeiras, and
ready to sail, and supposing he should easily meet
with a vessel there bound to Martinico, he went
on board, in order to sail to the Madeiras ; but the
master of the Portuguese ship, being but an indif-
ferent mariner, had been out in his reckoning, and
they drove to Fial, where, however, he happened
to nd a very good market for his cargo, which was
corn ; and, therefore, resolved not to go to the Madei-
ras, but to load salt at the Isle of May, and to go
away to Newfogzndland He had no remedy in this
exigence, but to go with the ship, and had a pretty
good voyage as far as the Banks, so they call the
place where they catch the ‘sh, where meeting
with a French ship, bound from France to Quebec,
in the river of Canada, and from thence to Marti-
nico, to carry provisions, he thought he should have
an opportunity to complete his rst design: but
when he came to Quebec, the master of the ship
died, and the ship proceeded no farther. So the
next voyage he shippedliimself for France, in the
ship that was burnt, when we took them up at
sea, and then shipped with us for the East Indies,
as I have already said. Thus he had been disap-
pointed in ve voyages, all, as Imay call it, in one
voyage, besides what I shall have occasion to men-
tion farther of the same person.
But I shall not make digressions into other men's
stories, which have no relation to my own. I re-
turn to what concerns our alfair in the island. Ile
came to me one morning, for he lodged among us
all the whilewe were upon the island ; and it hap-
pened to bejust when I was going to visit the Eug-
lishmen’s colony, at the farthest part of the island;
r
I say, he came to me, and told me, with a very
grave countenance, that he had, for two or three
days, desired an opportunity of some discourse with
me, which, he hoped, would not be displeasiiig to
me, because he thought it might, in some measure,
correspond with my general design, which was the
prosperity of mynew colony, and, perhaps, might
put it, at least more than he yet thought it was, in
the way of God’s blessing. ~
I looked a little surprised at the last part of his
discourse, and turning a little short, ‘ How, sir,’
said I, ‘ can it be said, that we are not in the
way of God’s blessing, after such visible~assist-
anccs, and wonderful deliverances, as we have seen
here, and of which I have given you a large ac-
count?’ §
‘ If you had pleased, sir,’ said he (with a world
of modesty, and yet with great roa.diness), ‘to
have heard me, you would have found no room to
have been displeased, much less to think so hard
of me, that I should suggest that you have not had
wonderful assistances and deliverances: and, .l
hope, on your behalf, that you are in the way of
God's blessing, and your design is exceeding good,
and will prosper. But, sir,’ said he, ‘ though it
were more so than is even possible to you, yet
there may be some among you that are not equally
right in their actions: and you know that, in the
story of the children of Israel, one Achan, in the
camp, removed God’s blessing from them, and
turned his hand so against them, that thirty-six of
them, though not concerned in the crime, were the
objects of divine vengeance, and bore the weight
of that punishment. *
I was sensibly touched with this discourse, and
told him his inference was so just, and the whole
design seemed so sincere, and was really so reli-
gious in its own nature, that I was very sorry I had
interrupted him, and begged him to go on: and,
in the mean time, because it seemed that what we
had both to say, might takeiup some time, I told
him, I was going to the Englislnnen’s plantations,
and asked him to go with me, and we might dis-
course of it by the way. He told me, he would the
more willingly wait on me thither, because there
partly the thing was acted which he desired to
speak to me about. So we walked on, and I press-
cd him to be free and plain with me in what he had
to say. ‘ -
‘ Why then, sir,’ says he, ‘ be pleased to give me
leave to lay down a few propositions, as the foun-
dation of what I have to say, that we may not dif-
fer in the general principles, though we may be of
some differing opinions in the practice of particu-
lars. First, sir, though we diifer in some of the
doctrinal articles of religion, and it is very un-
happy that it is so, especially in the case before us,
as I shall show afterwards; yet there are some
general principles in which we both agree; viz.
rst, that there is a God, and that this God having
given us some stated general rules for our service
and obedience, we ought not willingly and know-
ingly to offend him, either by neglecting to do what
he has commanded, or by doing what he has ex-
pressly forbidden. And let our different religions
be what they will, this general principle is readily
owned by us all; that the blessing of God does not
ordinarily follow at presumptuous sinning against
his command; and every good Christian will be
affectionately concerned to prevent any, that are
under his care, living iua total neglect of God and
his commands.‘ It is not your men being protest-
ants, whatever my opinion may be of such, that
discharges me from being concerned for their souls,
and from endeavouring, if it lies before me, that
they should live in as little distance from, and
enmity with, their_ Maker as possible; especially
if you give me leave to meddle so far in your
circuit.’ \
' I could not yet imagine what he aimed at, and
told him I granted all he had said; and thanked
him that he would so far concern himself for us ;
and begged he would explain the particulars of
what he had observed, that, like Joshua (to take his
own parable), I might put away the accursed thing
from us.
‘ Why then, sir,’ says he, ‘ I will take the liberty
you give me; and there are three things, which, if
I am right, must stand in the way of God’s bless~
i-ng upon your endeavours here, 'and which I should
re-_joice, for your sake and their own, to see re-
moved. And, sir,’ says he, ‘ I promise myself that
you will fully agree with me in them all, as soon
as I name them; especially because I shall con-
vince you, that every one of them may, with great
ease, and very much .t0 your satisfaction, be re-
medied.’
I-Ie gave meno leave to put in any more civili-
ties, but went on. ‘ First, sir,’ says he, ‘ you have
here four Englishmen, who have fetched women
from among the savages, and have taken them as
their wives, and have had many children by them
all, and yet are not married to them, after any
stated, legal manner, as the laws of God and man
require; and therefore are yet, in the sense of
both, no less than adulterers, and living in adul-
tery. 'l‘o this, sir,’ says he, ‘ I know you will ob-
ject, that there was no clergyman, or priest of any
kind, or of any profession, to perform the cere-
mony; nor-any pen and ink, or paper, to write
down a contract of marriage, and have signed it
between them. And I know also, sir, what the
Spaniard governor has told you; I mean, of the
agreement that he obliged them to make, when
they took these women, viz. that they should
choose them out by consent, and keep separately to
them, which, by the way, is nothing of a marriage,
no agreement with the women as wives, but only
an agreement among themselves, to keep them
from quarrelling. '
-.
‘ But, sir, the essence of the sacrament of matri-
mony (so he called it, being a Roman) consists not
only in the mutual consent of the parties to take
one another, as man and wife, but in the formal
and legal obligation that there is in the contract, to
compel the man and woman, at all times, to own and
acknowledge each other, obliging the men to abstain
from all other women, to engage in no other con-
tract whilo these subsist, and, on all occasions, as
ability allows, to provide honestly for them and
their children; and to oblige the women to the
same or like conditions, mutatis mutandis, on
their side. >-*
‘ Now, sir,’ says he, ‘ these men may, when they
please, or when occasion presents, abandon these
women, disown their children, leave them to perish,
and take other women, and marry them whilst these
are living.’ And here he added, with some warmth,
‘ How, sir, is God honoured in this unlawful liber-
ty? and how shall a blessing succeed your endea-
vours in this place, however good in themselves, and
however sincere in your design, while these men,
who, at present, are your subjects, under your ab-
solute government and dominion, are allowed by
you to live in open adultery?’
I confess I was struck at the thing itself, but
much more with the convincing arguments he sup-
ported it with; for it was certainly true, that
though they had no clergyman on the spot, yet a
formal contract on both sides, made before wit-
nesses, and conrmed by any token, which they
had all agreed to be bound by, though it had been
but the breaking a stick between them, engaging
the men to own these women for their wives upon
all occasions, and never to abandon them or their
children, and the women to the same with their
husbands, had been an effectual lawful marriage in
the sight of God ; and it was a great neglect thatit
was not done.
But I thought to have gotten oil’ with my young
(R

priest, by telling him that all that part was done
when I was not here; and they had lived so many
years with them now, that, if it was an adultery,
it was past remedy; they could do nothing in it
now. "
‘ Sir,’ says he, ‘ asking your pardon for such free-
dom, you are right in this, that it being done in
your absence, you could not be charged with that
part of the crime. V But I beseech you, atter not
yourself that you are not therefore under an obli-
gation to do your utmost now to put an end to
it. I-Iow can you think but that, let the time past
lieion whom it will, all the guilt, for the future, will
lie entirely upon you; because it is certainly in
your power now to put an end to it, and in no-
body’s power but yours?’
I was so dull still, that I did not take him right;
but I imagined, that by putting an end ‘to it, he
meant that I should part them, and not suffer them
to live together any longer; and [said to him, I
could not do that by any means, for that it would
put the whole island in confusion. He seemed sur-
prised that I should so far mistake him. ‘ No, sir,’
says he, ‘ I do not mean that you should separate
them, but legally and effectually marry them now.
And, sir, as my way of marrying them may not be
so easy to reconcile them ‘to, though it will be as
effectual, even by your own laws; so your way
may be as well before God, and as valid among
men_; I mean, by a written contract, signed by both
man and woman, and by all the witnesses present,
which all the laws of Europe would decree tobe
valid.
I was amazed to see so much true piety, and so
much sincerity of zeal, besides the unusual impar-
tiality in his discourse, as to his own party or
church, and such a true warmth for the preserving
people that he had no knowledge of, or relation to,
I say, for preserving them from transgressing the
-‘laws of God, the like of which I had, indeed, not
met with<any where. But recollecting what he
had said of marrying them by a written contract,
which I knew would stand too; I returned it back
upon him, and told him I granted all that he had
said to be just, and, on his part, very kind; that I
would discourse with the men upon the point now,
when I came to them. And I knew no reason why
they should scruple to let him marry them all,
which I knew well enough would be granted to be
as authentic and valid in England, as if they were
married by one of our own clergymen. What was
al"terwards done in this matter, I shall speak of by
itself.
I then pressed him to tell me, what was the se-
cond complaint which he had to make, acknowledg-
ing that I was very much hi-s debtor for the rst,
and thanked him heartily for it. IIe told me he
would use the same freedom and plainness in the
second, and hoped I would take it as well ;_ and this
was, that, notwithstanding these English subjects
of mine, as he called them, had lived with those
women for almost seven years, and had taught
them to speak English, and even to read it; and
that they were, as he perceived, women of tolerable
understanding, and capable of instruction; yet
they had not to this hour taught them any thing
of the Christian religion, no, not so much as to
know that there was a God, or a worship, or in
what manner God was to be served, or that their
own idolatry, and worshipping they knew not-whom,
was false and absurd. .
This, he said, was an unaccountable neglect, and
what God would certainly call them to an account
for; and, perhaps, at last, take the work out of
their hands. He spoke this very affectionately and
warmly. ‘ I am persuaded,’ says he, ‘ had those
men lived in the savage country whence their wives
came, the savages would have taken more pains to
have brought them to be idolaters, and to worship
the devil, than any of these men, so far as I cm
see, has taken with them, to teach them the know-
ledge of the true God. New", sir,’ said he, ‘though
I do not acknowledge your religion‘, or you mine,
yet we should be all glad to see the devil’s serv-
ants, and the subjects of his kingdom, taught to
know the general principles of the Christian reli-
gion, that they might, at least, hear of God, and of
a Redeemer, and of the resurrection, and of a fu-
ture state, things which we all believe; they had,
at least, been -so much nearer coming into the bo-
som of the true church than they are now, in the
public profession of idolatry -and devil-worship.’
I could hold no longer; I took him in my arms,
and embraced him with an excess of passion. ‘ I-low
far,’ said I to him, ‘ have I been from understanding
the most essential part of a Christian, viz. to love
the interest of the Christian church, and the good
of other men's souls? I scarce have known what
belongs to being a Christian.’ ‘ Oh, sir, do not say
sot!" replied he: ‘ this thing is not your fault.’
‘ No,’ said I; ‘ but why did I never lay it to heart
as well as you?’ ‘ ”.l‘is not too late yet,’ said he 2
‘ be not too forward to condemn yourself.’ ‘ But
what can be done now?’ said I. ‘ You see I am
going away.’ ‘ Will you give me leave,’ said he,
‘ to talk with these poor men about it?’ ‘ Yes,
with all my heart,‘ said I; ‘ and will oblige them
to give heed to what you say too.’ ‘ As to that,’
said he, ‘ we must leave them to the mercy of
Christ; but it is our business to assist them, en-
courage them, and instruct them; and, if you will
give me leave, and God his blessing, I do not
doubt but the p'6‘or, ignorant souls shall be brought
home into the great circle of Christianity, into
the pa-rticular faith that we all embrace; and
that even while you stay here.’ Upon this, I said,
‘ 1 shall not only give you leave, but give you a
thousand thanks for it.’ What followed on this ac-
count, I shall mention also again in its place.
I now pressed him for the third article in which
we were to blame. ‘ Why, really,’ says he, ‘ it is of
the same nature; and I will proceed (asking your
leave) with the same plainness as before. It is
about your poor savages yonder, who are (as I may
say) your conquered subjects. It is a maxim, sir,
that is, -or ought to be, received among all Chris-
tians, of what church, or pretended church, soever,
viz. that Christian knowledge ought to be propa-
gated by all possible means, and on all possible oc-
casions. It is on this principle that our church
sends missionaries into Persia, India, and China;
and that our clergy, even of the superior sort, will-
ingly engage in the most hazardous voyages, and
the most dangerous residence among murderers and
barbarians, to teach them the knowledge of the
true God, and to bring them over to embrace the
Christian faith. Now, sir, you have such an oppor-
tunity here, to have six or seven and thirty poor
savages brought over from idolatry to the knowledge
of God, their Maker and Redeemer, that I wonder
how you can pass such an occasion of doing good ;
which is really worth the expense of a man’s whole
life.’
1 was now struck dumb indeed, and had not one
word to say. 1 had‘l1ere a spirit of true Christian
zeal for God and religion before me, let his particu-
lar principles be of what kind soever. As for me,
I had not so much as entertained a thought of this
in my heart before; and, I believe, I should not
have thought of it; for I looked upon these savages
as slaves, and people whom, had we had any work for
them to do, we would have used as such, or would
have been glad to have transported them to any
other part of the world; for our business was to
get rid of them: and we would all have been satis-
ed if they had been sent to any country, so they
had never seen their own. But to the case; I say,
I_was confounded at his discourse, and knew not
what answer to make him. I-Ie looked earnestly at
me, and seeing me in some disorder, ‘ Sir,’ said he,
‘ I shall be very sorry, if what I have said gives you
any offence.’ ‘ No, no,’ said I; ‘ I am offended
with nobody but myself; but I am perfectly con-
founded, not only to think that I should never take
any notice of this before, but with reecting what
notice I am able to take of it now. You know,
sir,’ s-aid I, ‘ what circumstances I am in: I am
bound to the East Indies, in a ship freighted by
merchants, and to whom it would be an insuffer-
able piece of injustice to detain the ship here, the
men lying all this while at victuals and wages upon
the owners’ account. It is true, I agreed to be al-
lowed twelve days here, and if I stay more, I must
pay three pounds sterling per diem, dc-murrage.’ Nor
can I stay upon demurragc above eight days more-;
and I have been here thirteen days already: so that
I am porfectl y unable to, engagein this work,,unless
I would suffer myself to be left behind here again,
in which case, if this single ship should miscarry
i-n any part of her voyage, I should be just in the
same condition that I was left in here at rst;
and from which I -have been so wonderfully de-
livered.
I-Ie owned the case was very hard upon me, as to
my voyage; but laid it home upon my conscience,
whether the blessing of saving seven and thirty
souls was not worth my venturing all I had in the
world for. I was not so sensible of that as he was,
a-nd I returned upon him thus, "Why, sir, it is a
valuable thing indeed to be an instrument in God’s
hand, to convert seven and thirty He-ath_ens to the
knowledge of Christ. But as you are an eccle-
siastic, and are given over to that work, so that
it seems naturally to‘ fall into the way of your
profession; how is it then, that you do not rather
o'er yourself to undc1*ta.ke it, than press me to it?’
Upon this he faced about, just before ine, as we
walked along, and, putting me to a full stop, made
me avery low bow. ‘ I most heartily thank God,
and you, sir,’ says he, ‘ for giving me so evident a
call to so blessed a work; and if you think your-
self discharged from it, and desire me to under;
take it, I will most readily do it, and think it a
happy reward for all the hazards and difficulties
of such a broken, disappointed voyage as I have
met with, that I have dropped at last‘ into so glo-
rious a work.
I discovered a kind of rapture in his face, while
he spoke this to me; his eyes sparkled like re,
his face glowed, and his colour came and went, as
if he had been falling into ts: in a word, he was
red with the joy of being embarked in such a
work. I paused a considerable while, before I
could tell what to say to him, for I was really sur-
prised to nd a man of such sincerity and zeal, and
carried out in his zeal, beyond the ordinary rate of
men, not of his profession only, but even of any
profession whatsoever. But, after I had considered
it a while, 1 asked him seriously if he was in ear-
nest, and that he would venture on the single con-
sideration of an attempt on those poor people, to
be locked up in an‘unplanted' island for, perhaps,
his life; and at last might not know-whether he
should be able to do them any good, or not?.'
He turned short upon me, and asked me, what
I called a venture. ‘ Pray, sir,’ said he, ‘ what do
you think I consented to go in your ship to the
East Indies for?’ ‘ Nay,’ said I, ‘ that I know not,
unless it was to preach to the Indians.’ r ‘ Doubt-
less it was,’ said he; ‘ and do you think, if I can
convert tlrese seven-and-thirty men to th_e_faith of
Christ, it is not worth my time, though I should
never be fetched off the island again? Nay, is it
not innitely of more worth to save so many souls,
than my life is, or the‘ life of twenty more of the
same profession? Yes, sir,’ said he, ‘ I would give
Christ and the blessed Virgin thanks all my days,
if I could be made the ‘least happy instrument of
saving the souls of these poor men, though I was
never to set my foot o‘ this island, or see my na-
X
tive country any more. But since you will honour
me,’ said he, ‘ with putting me into this work (for
which I will pray for you all the days of my life),
I have one humble petition to you,’ said he, ‘ be-
sides.’ ‘ What is that?’ said I. ‘ Why,’ said he,
‘ it is, that you will leave your man Friday with
me, to be my interpreter to them, and to assist me;
for without some help, I cannot speak to them, or
they to me.’
I was sensibly troubled at his requesting Friday,
because I could not think of parting with him, and
that for many reasons. He had been the companion
of my travels; he was not only faithful to me, but
sincerely affectionate to the last degree; and 1 had
resolved to do something considerable for him, if he
outlived me, as it was probable he would. Then I
knew that as I had bred Friday up to be a protest-
ant, it would quite confound him to bring him to
embrace another profession; and he would never,
while his eyes were open, believe that his old ma-
ster was a heretic, and would be damned; and
this might, in the end, ruin the poor fellow’s .prin-
ciples, and so turn him back again to his rst
idolatry.
I‘I'owe-ver, a sudden thought relieved me in this
strait, and it was this: I told him I could not say
that I was willing to part with Friday on any
account whatever; though a work that to him was
of more value‘ than his life, ought to be to me
of much more value than the keeping or parting
with a servant: but, on the other hand, I was per-
suaded that Friday would by no means consent to
part with me; and then to force him to it, without
his consent, would be manifest injustice; because I
had promised I would never put him away; and he
had promised and engaged to me, that he would
never leave me, unless I put him away.
He seemed very much concerned at it, for he had
no rational access to these poor people, seeing he
did not understand one word of their language, nor
they one word of his. To remove this difeulty,
I told him Friday's father had learned Spanish,
which I found he also understood, and he should
serve him for an interpreter: so he was much
better satised, and nothing could persuade him,
but he would stay to endeavour to convert them :
but Providence gave another and very happy turn
to all this.
1 come back now to the rst part of his objec-
tions. When we came to the Englishmen, I sent
for them all together; and after some account
given them of what I had done for them, viz. what
necessarythings I had provided for them, and how
they were distributed, which they were sensible of,
and very thankful for; I began to talk to them of
the scandalous life they led, and gave them a full
aeeountef the notice the clergyman had already
taken of it; and, arguing how unehristian and irre-
ligious a life it was, I rst asked them, if they were
married men or bachelors. They soon explained
their condition to me, and showed me that two of
them were widowers, and the other three were
single men, or bachelors. 1 asked them with what
conscience they could take these women, and lie
with them, as they had done, call them their wives,
and have so many children by them, and not be
married lawfully to them.
They all gave me the answer that I expected;
viz. that there was nobody to marry them; that
they agreed before the governor to take them as
their wives, and to keep them, and own them as
their wives; and they thought, as things stood
with them, they were as legally married, as if they
had been married by a parson, and with all the for.
malities in the world. V
I told them that no doubt they were married in
the sight of God, and were bound in conscience to
keep them as their wives; but that the laws of men
being otherwise, they might pretend they were not
married, and so desert the poor women and ehild~
\
ren hereafter; and that their wives, being poor‘
desolate women, friendlcss and moneyless, would
have no way to help themselves. I, therefore, told
them that unless I was assured of their honest in-
tent, I could do nothing for them, but would take
care that what I did should be for the women and
children, without them; and that unless they
would give some assurances that they would marry
the women, I could not think it was convenient
they should continue together as man and wife;
for that it was both scandalous to men, and often
sive to God, who they could not think would bless
them, if they wenton thus. -
All this went on as I expected ; and they told me,
especially WillAtkins, who seemed now to speak
for the rest, that they loved their wives as well as
if the_y had been born in their own native country,
and would not leave them upon any account what-
ever; and they did verily believe their wives were
as virtuous, and as modest, and did, to the utmost
of their skill, as much for them and for their child-
ren, as any women could possibly do; and they
would not part with them on any account. And
William Atkins, for his own particular, added, if
any man would take ‘him away, and offer to carry
him home to England, and make him captain of the
best man of war in the navy, he would not go with
him, if he might not carry his wife and children
with him; and ii’ there was a cle1~gyinan in the
ship, he would be married to her now, with all his
heart.
This wasjust as I would have it. The priest was
not with me at that moment, but was not far off:
so to try him farther, I told him I had a clergyman
with me, and, if ho was sincere, I would have him
married the next morning; and bade him consider
of it, and talk with the rest. I-Io said, as for himself‘,
he need not consider of it at all; for he was very
ready to do it, and was glad I had a minister with
me; and ho believed they would be all willing also.
\
Ithcn told him that my friend, the minister, was a
Frenchman, and could not speak English; but that
1 would act the clerk between them. I'Ie never so
much as asked me whether he was a papist or pro-
testant, which was, indeed, what I was afraid of;
but, I say, they never inquired about it. So we
parted. I went back to my clergyman; and Will
Atkins went in to talk with his companions. I de-
sired the 1"r(-inch gentleman not to say any thing to
them, till the business was thorough ripe; and I
told him what answer the men had given me.
I’>el"ore I went from their quarter, they all came
to inc, and told me, they had been considering
what l had said; that they were very glad to hear
I had a clergyman in 'niy <-onipany, and thr-y were
very willingyto give me the .<iatisl"'a<rti0n l desired,
and to be Formally married as soon as I pleased, for
they were far from desiring to part from their
wives, and that they meant nothing but what was
very honest when they chose them. So I appoint-
ed them to meet me the next morning, and that, in
the mean time, they should let their wives know
the meaning of the marriage law, and that it was
not only to prevent any scandal, but also to oblige
them that they should not forsake them, whatever
might happen.
The women were easily made sensible of the
meaning of the thing, and were very well satised
with it, as indeed they had reason to be; so they
failed not to attend all together, at my apartment,
the next morning, where I brought out my cler y-
man : and though he had not on a minister's goxgi,
after the manner of England, or the habit of rt priest,
after the manner of France; yet having a black vest,
something like a cassock, with :1 sash round it, he
did not look very unlike a minister; and as for his
language, I was interpreter.
But the seriousness of his behaviour to them, and
the seruples he made of marrying the women, be-
cause they were not baptized, and professed Chri8-
tians, gave them an exceedinglreverence for his
person; and there was no need after that to inquire
"wlietlier he was a clergyman or no.
Indeed, I was afraid his seruple would have been
carried so far, as that he would not have married
them at all; nay, notwithstanding all I was able to
say. to him, he resisted me, though modestly, yet
very steadily; and, at last, refused absolutely to
marry them, unless he had rst talked with the
men, and the women too: and though, at rst, I
was a little backward to it, yet, at last, I agreed to
it‘"with a good will, perceiving the sincerity of his
design.
When he came to them, he let them know that I
had acquainted him with their circumstances, and
with the present design: that he was very willing to
perform that part of his function, and marry them,
as I had desired; butthat, before he could do it, he
must take the liberty to talk with them. He told
them that in the sight of all indifferent men, and in
the sense of the laws of society, they had lived all
this while in an open adultery; and that it was
true, that nothing but the consenting to marry, or
effectually separating them from one another now,
could put an end to it; but there was a difficulty in
it too, with respect to the laws of Christian matri-
mony, which he was not fully satised about, viz.‘
that of marrying one that is a professed Christian,
to a savage; an idolater, and a heathen, one that is
not baptized; and yet that he did not see that
there was time left for it, to endeavour to per-
suade thewomen to be baptized, or to profess the
name of Christ, whom they had; he doubted, heard
nothing of, and without which they could not be
baptized.
He told them he doubted they were butjndifferent
Christians themselves, that they had but little
knowledge of God, or of his ways ; and therefore he
could not expect that they had said much to their
wives on that head yet; but that unless they would
promise him to use their endeavours with their
wives, to persuade them to become Christians, and
would, as well as they could, instruct them in the
knowledge and belief of God that made them, and
to worship Jesus Christ that redeemed them, he
could not marry them; for he would have no hand
in joining Christians with savages; nor was it
consistent with the principles of the Christian reli-
gion, and was, indeed, expressly forbidden in God’:
law. \
They heard all this very attentively, and I deli;
vered it very faithfully to them, from his mouth, as
near his own words as I could, only sometimes add-
ing something of my own, to convince them how
just it was, and how I was of his mind: and I
always very faithfullydistinguished between what
I said from myself, and what were the clergymaifs
words. They told me, it was very true what the
gentleman had said, that they were but very indif-
ferent Christians themselves, and that they had
never talked to their wives about religion. ‘ Lord,
sir,’ said Will Atkins, ‘how should we teach them
religion? Why, we know nothing ourselves; and,
besides, sir,’ said he, ‘ should we go to talk to them
of God, and Jesus Christ, and heaven, and hell, it
would be to make them laugh at us, and ask us,
what we believe ourselves ? And if we should tell
them, we believe all the things that we speak of to
them, such as of goo.d people going to heaven, and
wicked people to the devil, they would ask us,
where we intended to go ourselves, who believe all
this, and yet are such wicked fellows, as we indeed
are? Why, sir,’ said Will, ‘it is enough to give
them a surfeit of religion at rst hearing. Folks
must have seine religion themselves, before they
pretend to teach other people.’ ‘ Will Atkins,’ said
1 to him, ‘ though I am afraid what you say has too
much truth in it, yet can‘ you not tell your wife,
that she is in the wrong; that there is a God, and
a religion better than her own; that her gods are
idols; that they can neither hear nor speak; that
there is a great Being that made all i'.ilil1'_‘.:',S, and
that can destroy all that he has made ; that he re-
wards the good, and punishes the bad ; that we are
to be judged by him, at last, for all we do here?
You are not so ignorant, but even nature itself
will teach you that all this is true; and I am satis-
lied you know it all to be true, and believe it
yourself.’
‘ That’s true, sir,’ said Atkins; ‘ hut with what
face can I say any thing to my wife of all this,
when she will tell me immediately, it cannot be
true ?’
‘ Not true?’ said I: ‘ what do you mean by that ?'
‘ Why, sir,’ said he, ‘ she will toll me it cannot be
true, that this God I shall tell her of can be just,
or can punish, or reward, since I a.m ‘not punished,
and sent to the devil, that have been such a wick-
ed crcature as she knows I have been, evcn to her
and to every body else; and that I should be suf-
fered to live, thathave been always acting so con-
trary to what I must tell her is good, and to what
I ought to have done.’
‘ Why truly, Atkins,’ said I, ‘ I am afraid thou
speakest too much lruth;’ and with that I let the
clergyman know what Atkins had said, for he was
impatient to know. ‘ O !’ said the priest, ‘ tell
him there is one thing will make him the best mini-
stcr in the world to his wife, and that is, repentance;
for none teach repentance like true penitents. Isle
wants nothing but to repent, and then he will be
so much the better qualified to instruct his wife; he
will be then able to tell her, that there is not only
a. God, and that he is the just rewardcr of good and
evil, but that he is a merciful Being, and, with infi-
nite goodness and long-sull°ering, forbcars to punish
those that offend, waiting to be gracious, and will-'
ing not the death of a sinner, but rather that he
should return and live; that he often suffers wick.-
ed men to go on a long time, and even reserves
damnation to the general day of retribution; that
it is a clear evidence of God and of a future state,
that righteous men receive not their reward, or
wicked men their punishment, till they come into
another world; and this will lead him to teach
his wife the doctrine of the resurrection, and of the
last judgement. Let him but repent for himself, he
will be an excellent -preacher of repentance to his
wife.’
I repeated all this to Atkins, who looked very sc-
rious all the while, and who, we could easily per-
ceive, was more than ordinarily affected with it:
when being eager, and hardly suffering me to make
an end, ‘ l knew all this, master,’ said he, ‘ and a
great deal more, but I ha’n't the impudeuce to talk
thus to my wife, when God and my own con-
science knows, and my wife will be an undeniable
evidence against me, that I have lived as if I had
never heard of a God, or of a future state, or any
thing about it; and to talk of my repenting, alas!
(and with that he fetched a deep sigh, and I could
see that tears stood in his eyes), ’Lis past all that
with me.’ ‘ Past it! Atkins,’ said I; ‘ what dost
thou mean by that?’ ‘ I know well enough what I
mean, sir,’ said he: ‘ 1 mean ‘tis too late; and that
is too true.’
I told my clergyman, word for word, what he
said. The poor zealous priest (I must call him so,
for be his opinion what it will, he had certainly a
most singular affection for the good of other men's
souls, and it would be hard to think he had not the
like for his own; I say, this zealous, affectioiiate
inan) could not refrain tears also; but, recovering
himself, he said to me, ‘ Ask him but one question,
Is he easy that it is too late, or is he troubled, and
wishes it were not so?’ I put the question fairly to
Atkins, and he answered with a great deal of pas-
sion, How could any man be easy in a condition
that certainly must end in eternal destruction;
that he was far from being easy, but that, on the
X 2 "
contrary, he believed it would, one time or other,
ruin him.
‘ What do you mean by that?’ said I. Why,
he said, he believed he should, one time or other,
cut his own throat, to put an end to the terror
of it. I
The clergyman shook his head, with a great eon-
cern in his face, when I told him all this ; but turn-
ing quick to me upon it, says, ‘ If that be his case,
you may assure him it is not too late: Christ will
give him repentance. But pray,’ says he, ‘ explain
this to him, that as no man is saved but by Christ,
and the merit of his passion, proc'uring divine
mercy for him, how can it be too late for any man to
receive mercy? Does he think he is able to sin
beyond the power or reach of divine mercy? Pray
tell him there may be a time when provoked mercy
will no longer strive, and when God may refuse to
hear, but that it is never too late for men to ask
mercy, and we that are Christ‘s servants are coin-
manded to preach mercy at all times, in the name
of Jesus Christ, to all those that sincerely repent;
so that it is never too late. to repent.’
I toldAtkins all this, and he heard me with great
earnestness ; but it seemed as if he turned o" the
discourse to the rest, for he said to me he would go
and have some talk with his wife. So he went out
a while, and we talked to the lest. I perceived
they were all stupidly ignorant, as to matters or
religion, much as I was when I went rambling
away from my father, and yet that there were
none of them backward to hear what had been
said, and all of them seriously promised that they
would talk with their wives about it, and do
their endeavours to persuade them to turn Chris-
tians.
'.l‘he clergyman smiled upon me. when I reported
what answer they gave, and said nothing a good
while; but, at last, shaking his head, ‘ We that are
Christfs servants,’ says he, ‘ can go no further than
v
to exhort and instruct; and when men comply, sub-
mit to the reproof, and promise what we ask, it is
all we can do: we are hound to accept their good
words. But believe me, sir,’ said he, ‘ wliatever
you may have known of the life ol’ that man you
call William Atkins, I believe he is the only sincere
convert among them. I take that man to be a true
penitent; I will not despair of the rest; but that
man is apparently struck with the sense of his past
life; and I doubt not, but when he comes to talk
religion to his wife, he will talk himself eli'ectu:illy
into it;y for attempting to teach others, is some-
times the best way of teaching ourselves. I knew
a man,’ added he, ‘ who, l1€1\'il1_£Z‘l1()ill1il1{J_,' but a sum-
mary notion of religion himself, and being wicked
and proigate to the last degree, in his life, made at
thorough reformation in himself, hy labouring to
convert a Jew : and if that poor Atkins begins hut
once to talk seriously of Jesus Christ to his wife,
my life for it, he talks himself into a thorough con-
vert, makes himself a penitent: and who knows
what may Follow?’
Upon this discourse, however, and their promis-
ing, as above, to endeavour to |)Ol‘$LI(L(lG their wives
to embrace Christianity, he married the other three
couple: but Will Atkins and his wife were not yet
come in. After this, my clergyman waiting a
while, was curious to know where Atkins was gone,
and turning to me, says he, ‘ I entreat you, sir, let
us walk out of your labyrinth here, and look; I
dare say we shall nd this poor man, somewhere
“or other, talking scriousl y with his wife, and teach-
ing her already something of religion.’ 1 began to
be of the same mind. So we went out together;
and I carried him a way which none knew but my-
self, and where the trees were so thick set, as that
it was not easy to see through the thicket of leaves,
and far harder to see in, than to see out; when
coming to the edge of the wood, I saw Atkins and
his tawny, savage wife, sitting under the shade of a
bush, very eager in discourse. I stopped short, till
my clergyman came up to me, and then, having
showed him where they were, we stood and looked
very steadily at them a good while.
We observed him very earnest with her, pointing
up to the sun, and to every quarter of the heavens,
then down to the earth, then out to the sea, then
to himself, then to her, to the woods, to the trees.
‘ Now,’ says my clergyman, ‘ you see my words are
made good : the man preaches to her. Mark him ;
now he is tellingxher that our God has made him,
and her, and the heavens, the earth, the sea, the
woods, the trees, &c.’ ‘ I believe he is,’ said I.
Iminediately we perceived Will Atkins start up
upon his feet, fall down upon his knees, and lift
up both his hands. We suppose he said something,
but we could not hear him: it was too far for that.
Ile did not continue kneeling halt‘ a minute, but
comes and sits down again by his wife, and talks
to her again. We perceived then the woman very
attentive, but whether she said any thing or no, we
eould not tell. While the poor fellow was upon
his knees, I could see the tears run plentifully down
my clergyman’s cheeks; and I could hardly forbt-ar
myself: but it was a great aliction to us both, that
we were not near enough to hear any thing that
passed between them.
Well, however, we could come no nearer, for fear
of disturbing them ; so we resolved to see an end
oi‘ this piece ol’ still conversation; and it spoke
loud enough to us, without the helpof voice. He
sat down again, as I have said, close by her, and
talked again very earnestly to her, and two or three
times we could see him embrace her passionately;
another time we saw him take out his handker-
chief, and wipe her eyes, and tlfen kiss her again,
with a kind of transport very unusual : and, after
several of these things, we saw him, on a sudden,
jump up again, and lend her his hand to help her
up, when immediately leading her by the hand, ‘a
I
step or two, they both kneeled down together, and
continued so about two minutes.
My friend could bear it no longer, but cries out
aloud, ‘ Saint Paul! Saint Paull behold he pray-
eth!’ I was afraid Atkins would hear him ; there~
fore I entreated him to withhold himself a while,
that we might see the end of the scene, which to
me, I must confess, was the most affecting, and yet
the most agreeable, that ever 1 saw in my life.
Well, he strove with himself, and contained himself
for a while, but was in such raptures ofjoy to think
that the poor heathen woman was become a Chris-
tain, that he was not able to contain himself: he
wept several times, then throwing up his hands,
and crossing his breast. said over several things
ejaculatory, and by way of giving God thanks for
so miraculous a testimony of the success of our en-
deavours. Some he spoke softly, and I could not
well hear; others audibly, some in Latin, some in
French; then two'or three times the tears of joy
would interrupt him, that ho could not speak at all.‘
But 1 begged that he would compose himself, and
let us more narrowly and fully observe what was
before us, “which he did for a time, and the scene
was not ended there yet; for after the poor man and
his wife were risen again from their knees, we ob-
served he stood talking still eagerly to her; and
we observed by her motion that she was greatly
affected with what he said, by her frequent lifting
up her hands, laying her hand to her breast, and
such other postures, as usually express the greatest
seriousness and attention. This continued about
half a quarter of an hour, and then they walked
away too; so that we could see no more of them in
that situation.
I took this interval. to talk with my clergyman:
and, rst, I told him I was glad to see the particu~
larswe had both been witnesses to ; that though I
was hard enough of belief in such cases, yet that
I began to think it was all very sincere here, both,
in the man and his wife, however ignorant they
might both be; and I hoped such a beginning
would have yet a more happy end, ‘ And who
knows,’ said l, ‘ hut these two may in time, by in-
struction and example, work upon some of the
others?’ ‘Some of them!’ said he, turning quick
upon me, ‘ aye, upon all of them: depend upon it,
if those two savages (for he has been but little bet-
ter, as you relate it) should embrace Jesus Christ,
they will never leave till they work upon all the
rest; for true religion is naturally communicative,
and he that is once made a Christian, will never
leave a Pagan behind him, if he can help it.’ I
owned it was a most Christian principle to think
so, and a testimony ofa true zeal; as well as a ge-
nerous heart in him. ‘ But, my friend,‘ said I,
‘ will you give me leave to start one ditlieulty
here? _.I cannot tell how to object the least thing
against that a'ectionate concern which you show
for the turning the poor people from their Pagan-
ism to the Christian religion. But how does this
comfort you, while these people are, in your ac-
count, out of the pale of the catholic ‘church, with-
out which you believe there is no salvation; so
that you esteem these but heretics still, and, for
other reasons, as effectually lost as the Pagans
tliemselves. ,
To this he answered, with abundance of candour
and Christian charity, thus: ‘ Sir, I am a catholic
of the Roman church, and a priest of the order of
1
saint Benedict, and I embrace all the principles ot
the Roman faith; but yet, if you will believe me,
and this I do not speak in compliment to you, or in
respect to my circumstances and your civilities, I
say, nevertheless, I do not look upon you, who call
yourselves reformed, without some charity. I dare
not say, though I know it is our opinion in general ;
yet I dare not say, that you cannot be saved; I will
by no means limit the mercy of Christ, so far as to
lihink tlial; he cannot receive you into the bosom of
hischurch in a manner to us unperceivahle, and
which it is impossible for us to know; and I hope
you have the same charity for us. I pray daily for
your being all restored to Christ’s church, by
whatsoever methods he, who is all-wise, is pleased
to direct. In the mean time, sure you will allow it
to consist with me as a Roman, to distinguish far
between a protestant and a Pagan; between one
that call-s on Jesus Christ, though in a way which I
do not think is according, to the true faith, and a
savage, a barbarian, that knows no God, no Christ,
no Redeemer; and if you are not within the‘
pale of the catholic church, we hope you are nearer
being restored to it, than those that know nothing
at all of God, or his church. I rejoice, therefore,
when I see this poor man, who, you say, has been
a pr-otligatc, and almost a murderer, kneel clown
and pray to Jesus Christ, as we suppose he did,
though "not Fu"l'ly enlightened; believing that God,
from whom every such work proceeds, will sensibly
touch his heart, and bring him to the further know-
ledge of the truth in his town time; and if God
shall inuence this poor man to convert and in-
struct the ignoraiit savage his wife, I can never be-
lievc that he shall be cast away-himself. And have
I not reason then to rejoice, the nearer any are
brought to the knowledge of Christ, though they-
may not be brought quite home into the bosom of
the catholic church, just at the time when I may
desire it, leaving it to the goodness of Christ to
perfect his work in his own time, and his own
way? Certainly I would rejoice if all the savages
in America were brought, like this poor woman, to
pray to God, though they were to be all protestants
at rst, rather than they should continue Pagans
and Heathens; rmly believing that he who had be-
stowed that rst light upon them, would further
illuminate them with a beam oi’ his heavenly grace,
and bring them into the pale of his church, when
lic should see good ."
I was astonished at the sincerity and temper of
this truly pious papist, as much as I was oppressed
by the power of his reasoning; and it ‘presently
occurred to my thoughts that if such a temper was
universal, we might be all catholic Christians, what-
ever church, or particular profession, we joined to,
or joined in; that a spirit of charity would soon
work us all up into right principles; and, in a.
word, as he thought, that the like charity would
make us all catholics, so I told him I believed,
had all the membersof his church the like mo-
deration, they would soon be all prostestants : and
there we left that part; for we never disputed at
all. '
I-Ioywever, I talked to him another way, and tak-
ing him by the hand, ‘ My friend,’ said I, ‘ I wish all
the clergy of the Roman church were blessed with
such moderation, and an equal share of your cha-
rity. I am entirely of your opinion; but I must
tell yon, that if you should preach such doctrine
in Spain or Italy, they would put you into the In-
quisition.’ »
_ ‘ It may be so,’ said he: ‘ I know not what they
might do _in Spain or Italy; but I will not say
they would be the better Christians for that seve.
rity, for I am sure there is no heresy in too much
charity.’ 7
Well, as Will Atkins and his wife were gone,
our business there was over; so we went back
our own way; and when we came back, we found
them waiting to be called in. Observing this, I
asked my clergyman, if we should discover to him,
that we had seen him under the bush, or no; and
it was his opinion we should not, but that we
should talk to him rst, and hear what he would
say to us. So we called him in alone, nobody
being in the place but ourselves; and I began with
him thus :
‘ Will Atkins,’ said I, ‘ prithee what education
had you? What was your father?’
TV. /1. A I-sitter man than ever I shall be. Sir,
rny father was a clergyman. _
_ R. -C. What education did he give you’?
I W’. /1. He would have taught me well, sir; but I
despised all education, instruction, or correction,
like a beast as I was. I
R. C’. It is true, Solomon says, ‘ He that despises
rcproof is brutish.’
TV.A.. Aye, sir, I was brutish indeed; I murdered
my farther: for God’s sake, sir, talk no more about
that, sir; I murdered my poor father!
Priest‘. Ila! a murderer!
Herc the priest started (for I interpreted every
word as he spoke it), and looked pale; it seems he
believed that Will had really killed his own father.
R. C. No, no, sir; I do not understand him so.
WillAtkins, explain yourself: you did not kill your
father, did you, with your own hands?
IV. A. No, sir; I did not cut his throat, but I
cut the thread of all his comforts, and shortened
his days. I broke his heart by the most ungrate-
ful, unnatural return for the most tender, affection-
ate treatment that ever father gave, or child could
receive. ‘
R. C. Well, I did not ask you about your father,
to extort this confession: I pray God to give you
repentance for it, and forgive you that and all your
other sins; but I asked you because I see that
though you have not much learning, yet you are
not so ignorant as some are, in things that are good;
that you have known more ol religion a great deal
than you have practised.
W. A. Tliough you, sir, did not extort the con-
fession that I make about my father, conscience
docs; and whenever we come to look back upon
our lives, the sins against our indulgent parents
are certainly _the rst that touch us; the wounds
they make lie. deepest, and the weight they leave
will lie heaviest upon the mind, of all the sins we
can commit. " '
R. C. You talk too feelingly and sensibly for me,
Atkins; I cannot bear it. _
IV. A. You bear it, master! I dare say you know
nothing of it.
R. C. Yes, Atkins, every shore, every hill, nay,
I may say, every tree in this island, is witness to
the anguish of my soul, for my ingratitude and
base usage of a good, tender father; a father much
like yours, by your description; and I murdered my
father as well as you, Will Atkins: but I think, for
all that, my repentance is short of yourstoo by a
great deal.
I would have said more, if I could have restrain-
ed my passions; but I thought this poor man’s re-
pentance was so much sincerer than mine, that I
was going to leave oil‘ the discourse, and retire;
for I was surprised with what he said, and thought
that, instead of my going about to teach and instruct
him, the man was made a teacher and instructor to
me, in a most surprising and unexpected manner.
I laid all this before the young clergyman, who
was greatly affected with it, and said to me, ‘ Did I
not say, sir, that when this man was converted, he
would preach to us all ? I tell you, sir, if this one
man be made a true penitent, here will be no need
of me; he will make Christians of all in the island.’
But having a little composed myself, I renewed my
discourse with Will Atkins.
‘ But, Will,’ said I, ‘ how comes the sense of this
matter to touch youjust now ?’ _
W‘. A. Sir, you have set me about a work that
has struck a dart through my very soul. I have
been talking about God and religion to my wife, in
order, as you directed me, to make a Christian of
her; and she has preached such a sermon to me, as
I shall never forget while I live.
R. C. No, no, it is not your wife has preached to
you; but when you were moving religious argu-
ments to her, conscience has ung them back. upon
you.
W’. A, Aye, sir, with such a. force as is not to be
resisted. ‘
R. C. Pray, Will, let us know what passed be-
tween you and your wife; for I know something of
it already.
W. /l. Sir, it is impossible to give you a full ac-
count ofit; I am too full to hold it, and yet have
no tongue to express it; but let her have said what
she will, and though 1 cannot give you an account
of it, this I can tell you of it, that I resolve to
amend and reform my life.
R. C. But tell us some of it. Ilow did you be-
gin Will? For this has been an extraordinary case,
that is certain : she has preached a sermon indeed,
if she has wrought this upon you.
IV. A. Why I rst told her the nature of our
laws about marriage; and what the reasons were
that men‘ and women were obliged to enter into
such compacts, as it was neither in the power of
one nor other to break; that otherwise order and
justice could not be maintained, and men would
run from their ‘wives, and abandon their children,
mix confusedly with one another, and neither fami-
lies be kept entire, nor inheritances be settled by a
legal descent. .
R. C’. You talk like a civilian, Will. Could
you make her understand what you meant by in-
heritance and families? They know no such thing
among the savages, but marry anyhow, without
regard to relation, consanguinity, or family; brother
and sister, nay, as I have been told, even the fa-
ther and daughter, and the son and the mother.
W. A. 1 believe, sir, you are misinformed; and
my wife assures me of the contrary, and that they
abhor it: perhaps for any farther relations, they
may not be so exact as we are; but she tells me
they never touch one another in the near relations
you speak ol‘.
R. O. Well, what did she say to what you told
her *
TV. A. She said she liked it very well, and it was
much better than in her country. »
R- C. But did you-tell her what marriage was?
W". /1. Aye, aye; there began all our dialogue.
I asked her it she would be married to me our way.
She asked me what way that was. I told her mar-
riage was appointed by God: and here we had a
strange talk together, -indeed, as ever man and wife
had, I believe. . .
N. B. This dialogue between W. Atkins and his
wife, as I took it down in writing, just after he told
it me, was as follows:
W4’/‘c. Appointed by your God! why, have you a
God in your country ?
I 7-V. /1. Yes, my dear: God is in every country.
T1-'17/‘c. No you God in my country: my country
have the great old Benamuckee god.
I/V. A. Child, I am very unt to show you who
God is: God is in heaven, and made the heaven
and the earth, the sea, and all that in them is.
Wylz. No makec de earth; no you God makee do
earth; no makce my country.
I ‘Will laughed a little at' her expression of God
not making her country.
W4‘/‘c. No laugh : why laugh me? This no thing
_to laugh.
I~Ie was justly reproved by his wife ; for she was
more serious than he at first.
W. Al. That's true, indeed: I will not laugh any
more, my dear. -
Mil;/‘C. Why you say, you God make all?
W. A. Yes, child, our God made the whole
world, and you, and me, and all things; for he is
the only true God: there is no God but he. He
lives for evei-‘in heaven. y
Wife. Why you no tell me long ago?
'W. ./1. 'Ihat's true, indeed; but I have been a
wicked wretch, and have not only forgotten to ac,-
guaint thee with any thing before, but have lived
without God in the world myself.
!V1§f'c. What have you de great God in you coun-
try, you no know him? No say O to him? No do
good thing for him? That no possible.
IV. A. 1t is true enough for all that. We live as
if there were no God in heaven, dr that he had no
power "on earth.
W1_f/‘c. But why God let you do so? Why he no
makee you good live 2
TV. /1.. It is all our own fault.
l~V§'j‘c. But you say me, he is great, much great,
have much great power; can makee kill when he
will; why he no makee kill when you no serve
him? No say O to him? No be good mans?
T/V. /1. That is true: he might strike me dead, and
I ought to expect it; for .l have been a wicked
wretch, that is true; but God is merciful, and does
not deal with us as we deserve.
Wife. But then do not you tell God, Thankee for
that too ?
WI A. No, indeed; L have not thanked God For
his mercy, any more tha-n I have feared God for his
power. ~
T=V{f'c. Then you God no God; me no think, be-
lieve, he be such one, great much power, strong;
no makee kill you, though you niakce him much
angry.
ll/V. 11. What! will my wicked life hinder you
from believing in God ! What a dread-Ful‘ creature
am I! and what a sad truth it is, that the horrid
lives of Christians hinder the conversion of hea-
thens! ,
T-Vi/‘e. I-low me tink you have great mucli God
up there (she points up to lieaven), and yet no do
well, no do good ting? Can he Sure he no
tell what you do? \
TV. /l. Yes, yes; he knows and see‘ all things:
he hears us speak, sees what we do, knows what we
think, though we do not speak.
-W5‘/‘Q. What l he no hear you swear, curse, speak
the great damn?
 
 
I
I
IV. A. Yes, yes ; he hears it all.
Wt/2:. Where be then the muchee great power
stroug? _
I/V. /l. He is merciful; that is all we can say
for it; and this proves him to be the true God : he
is God, and not man; and therefore we are not
consumed. '
I-Iere Will Atkins told us, he was struck with hor-
ror to think how he could tell his wife so clearly
that God sees, and hears, and knows the secret
thoughts of the heart, and all that we do ; and yet
that he had dared to do all the vile things he had
done.
I/V4‘/‘c. ll/Toreifu-l ! what you call (lat?
7/V. A. I-Ie is our Father and Maker; and he pi-
ties and spares us.
I/V~4'f‘<:. So then he never rnakee kill, never angry
when you do wicked; the‘n‘he no good himself, or
no great able.
I-V. /1. Yes, yes, my dear; he is innitely good,
and infinitely great, and able to punish too: and
sometimes, to show his justice and vengeance, he
lets fly his anger to destroy sinners, and make ex-
amples. Many arecut off in their sins.
Ill"./,7/‘c. But no makee kill you yet; then he tell
you, may be, that he no makee you kill, so you
makee do bargain with him, you do bad thing, he
no be angry at you, when he be angry at other
mans?
W. /1. No, indeed; my sins are all presump-
tions upon his goodness; and he would be in-
nitely just, if he destroyed me, as he has done
other men. ..
I'V1§fe. Well, and yet no kill, no makee you dead!
‘What you sa "Yhim for that? You notell him
Tankee for lat too !
I/V. A. I am an unthankful, ungrateful dog, that
is true.
Pl/fe. Why he no makee you much good better ?
You say he makee you. "
 
 
W’. A. Ile made me as he made all the world:
it is I have deformed myself, and abused his
goodness, and have made myself an abominable
wretch.
1V1;/‘c. I wish you makee God know me: I no
makee him angry ; 1 no do bad wicked thing.
Ilcre Will Atkins said his heart sunk within
him, to hear a poor, untaught creature desire to
be taught to kno\v God; and he such a wicked
wretch, that he could not say one word to her
about God, but-what the reproach of his own
carriage would make most irrational to her to be-
lieve; nay, that already she had told him that she
could not believe in God, because he that was so
wicked was not destroyed.
TV. A. My dear, you mean you wish I could
teacli you to know God, not God to know you; for
he knows you already, and every thought in your
heart.
Wgffe. Why then he know what I say to you now;
he know me wish to know him. Ilow shall me
know who makee me?
IV. /1. Poor creature, he must teach thee: I can-
not teach thee. 1’ll pray to him to teach thee to
know him; and to forgive me, that I am unworthy
to teach thee.
The poor fellow was in such an agony at her de-
siring him to make her know God, and her wish-
ing to know him, that he said he fell down on
his knees before her, and prayed to God to en-
lighten her mind with the saving knowledge of Je-
sus Christ, and to pardon his sins, and accept of
his being the unworthy instrument of instructing
her in the principles of religion; after which he
sat down by her again; and their dialogue went on.
N. B. ’l‘his was the time when we saw him kneel
down, and lift up his hands. ‘ ‘ ~
lV1§]c. What you put down the knee for? What
you hold up the hand for? What you suy? Who
you speak to? What is all that P
-
W. A. My dear, I bow my knees in token of
my submission to him that made me. I said, ‘O !’
'to him, as you call it; and as you say your old
men do to their idol Benamuckee; that is, I prayed
to him. ‘ .
I»Vzj‘e. What you say, O ! to him for? '
T/V. A. I prayed to him to open your eyes and
your understanding,'that you may know him, and
be accepted by him. .
Wife. Can he do that too ?
IV. A. Yes, he can : he can do all things.
"Wife. But he no hear what you say? ..
' IV. A. Yes, he has bid us pray to him; and pro-
mised to hear us. '
I»V§fc. Bid you pray! When he bid you? how he
bid you? What! you hear him speak?
W. A. No, we do nothear him speak; but he has
revealed himself many ways to us.
Here he was-. at a great loss to make her under-
stand, that God has revealed himself to us byhis
word, and what his word was; but, at last, he told
it her thus: '
W. A. God has spoken to some good men in
former days, even from heaven, by plain words;
and God has inspired good men by his Spirit ; and
they have written all his laws down in a book.
Wife. Me no understand that. Where is book?
W’. A. Alas! my poor creature, I have not this
book; but, I hope I shall, one time or other, get it
for you, and help you to read it.
Here he embraced her with great affection; but
with inexpressible grief that he had not a Bible.
T'VU‘c. But how you makee me know, that God
teachee them to write that book ?
W. A. By the same rule that we know him to
be God.
IV;/‘c. What rule, what way youknow? .
PV. A. Because he teaches and connnands nothing
but what is good, righteous, and holy; and tends to
make us perfectly good, as well as perfectly happy;
and because he forbids and commands us to avoid
all that is wicked, that is evil in itself, or evil in
its consequences. ~
W1}/‘c. That me would understand, that me fain
see: if he reward all good thing, punish all wicked
thing, he teachee all good thing, forbid all wicked
thing; he makee all thing, he give all thing"; he
hear me when I say O to him, as you go do just
now; he makee me good, if I wish be good; he
spare me, no makee kill me, when I no be good.
All this you say he do; yes, he be great God: me
take, think, believe, him be great God; me say,
O to him too, with you, my dear.
Here the poor man said he could forbear no
longer ; -sbut raising her up, made her kneel by him,
and he prayed to God aloud, to instruct her in the
knowledge of himself by his Spirit, and that, by
some good providence, if possib1e,- she might, some
time or other, come to have a Bible, that she might
read the word of God, and be taught by it to know
him.
This was the time that we saw him lift her up
by the hand, and saw him kneel down by her, as
above. _ '
They had several other discourses, it seems, after
this, too long to set down here; and particularly
she made him promise, that since he confessed his
own life had been a wicked, abominable course of
provocation against God, that he would reform it,
and not make God angry any more, lest he should
‘ makee him dead,’ as she called it, and then she
should be left alone, and never taught to knovr
this God better; and lest he should be miserable,
as he had told her wicked men should be after
death. _
This was a strange account, and very a“ect.
ing to us both, but particularly to the young
clergyman: he was indeed wonderfully surp,-ised
with it; but under the greatest aiiction imagin.
able, that he could not talk to her; that he coal‘:
Y .
not speak English to make her understand him;
and as she spoke but very broken English, he could
not understand her. However, he turned him-
self to me, and told me, that he believed there must
be more to do with this woman than to marry her.
I did not understandhim at rst, but at length
he explained himself, viz. that she ought to be
baptized. , .
I agreed with him in that part readily, and was
for going about it presently. ‘ No, no; hold sir,’
said he, ‘ though l would have her baptized by all
means, yet I must observe that Will Atkins, her
husband, has indeed brought her, in a wonderful
manner, to be willing to embrace a religious life;
and has given herjust ideas of the being of a God,
of his power, justice, mercy; yet I desire to know
of him, if he had said any thing to her of Jesus
Christ, and of the salvation of sinners; of the na-
ture of faith in him, and‘ redemption by him; of
the Holy Spirit,‘the resurrection, the last judge-
ment, and a future state.
I called Will Atkins again, and asked him; but
the poor fellow fell immediately into tears, and
told us, he had said something to her of all those
things, but that he was himself so wicked a crea-
ture, and his own conscience so reproached him
with his horrid, ungodly life, that he trembled at
the apprehensions that her knowledge of him should
lessen the attention she should give to those‘ things,
and make her rather contemn religion than receive
it.1~ But he was assured, he said, that her mind
was so disposed to receive due impressions of all
those things, that if I would but discourse with her,
she would make it appear to my satisfaction, that
my labour would not be lost upon her. .
Accordingly I called her in,‘ and, placing myself
as interpreter between my religious priest and the
woman, 1 cntreated him to begin with her; but
sure such a sermon was never preached by a popish
priest in these latter ages of the world; and, as I
told him, I thought he had all the zeal, all the
knowledge, all the sincerity of a Christian, with-
out the errors of a Roman catholic; and that I
took him to be such a clergyman as the Roman
bishops were, before the church of Rome assum-
ed spiritual sovereignty over the consciences of
men.
In a word, he brought the poor woman to em-
brace the knowledge of Christ, and of redemption
by him. not with wonder and astonishment only, as
she did the rst notions ofa God, but with joy and
faith, with an affection, and a surprising degree of
understanding, scarce to be imagined, much less to
be expressed; and, at her own request, she was
baptized. -
When he was preparing to baptize her, I entreat-
ed him that he would perform that office with some
caution, that the man might not perceive he was of
the Roman church, if possible; bécause of other
ill consequences which might attend a difference
among us in that very religion which we were in-
structing the other in. He told me that as he had.
no consecrated chapel, no proper things for the
oiele, I should see he would do it in a manner
that I should not know by it that he was a Roman
catholic myself, ifl had not known it before. And
so he did; for saying only some words over to
himself in Latin, which I could not understand,
he poured a dish full of water upon the wo-
1nan‘s head, pronouncing, in Ihcnch, very loud,
‘ Mary,’ which was the name her husband desired
me to give her, for I was her godfather, ‘ I bap-
tize thee in the name of the Father, and of the
Son, and of the I-Ioly Ghost ;’ so that none could
know any thing by it, what religion he was of.
He gave the benediction afterwards in Latin; but
either Will Atkins did not know but it was in
French, or else did not take notice of it at that
time.
As soon as this was over, he married them; and
after the marriage was over, he turned himself to
Will Atkins, and, in a very affectionate manner, ex-
horted him, not only to persevere in that good dis-
position he was in, but to support the convictions
that were upon him, by a resolution to reform his
life; told him it was in vain to say he repented, if
he did not forsake his crimes; represented to him
how God had honoured him with being the instru-
ment of bringing his wife to the knowledge of the
Christian religion; and that he should be careful
he did not dishonour the grace of God; and that,
if he did, he would see the Heathen a better Chris-
tian than himself, the savage converted, and the in-
strument cast away.
He said a great many good things to them both,
and then recommending them, in a few words,” to
God’s goodness, gave them the benediction again,
I repeating every thing to them in English. And
thus ended the ceremony. I think it waslithe most
pleasant, agreeable day to me that ever I passed in
my whole life.
But my clergyman had not done yet : his
thoughts hung continually upon the conversion ~of
the thirty-seven savages, and fain he would ‘have
staid upon the island to have undertaken it; but
“I convinced him, rst, that his undertaking was
impracticable in itself; and, secondly, that per-
haps 1 would put it into a way of being done, in
his absence, to his satisfaction : of which by and by.
Having thus brought the affair of the island to a
narrow compass, I was preparing to go on board
the ship, when the young man whom I had taken
outof the famished ship’s company, come to me,
and told me, he understood I had a clergyman
with me, and that I had caused the Englishmen to
be married to the savages, whom they called wives;
that he had a match too, which he desired might
be nished before I went, between two Chris-
tians, which, he hoped, would not be disagreeable
to me.
I knew this must be the young woman who was
his mother’s servant; for there was no other_Chris-
tian woman on the island: so I began to persuade
him not to do any thing of that kind rashly, or be-
cause he found himself in this solitary circumstance.
I represented that he had some considerable sub-
stance in the world, and good friends, as I under-
stood by himself, and by his maid also; that the
maid was not only poor, and a servant, but was
unequal to him, she being twenty-six or twenty-
seven years old, and he not above seventeen or
cighteen; that he might, very probably, with my
assistance, make a remove from this wilderness,
and come into his own country again; and that
then it would be a thousand to one but he would
repent his choice; and the dislike of that circum-
stance might be disadvantageous to both. I was
going to say more, but he interrupted me, smiling,
and told me, with a great deal of modesty, that I
mistook in my guesses, that he had nothing of that
kind in his thoughts, his present circumstance
being melancholy and disconsolate enough, and he
was very glad to hear, .that I had thoughts of put-
ting them in a way to see their own country again;
and that nothing should have set him upon stay-
ing there, but that the voyage I was going was so
exceeding long and hazardous, and would carry
him quite out of the reach of all his friends; that
he had nothing to desire of me, but that I would
settle him in some little property in the island
where he was, give him a servant or two, and some
few necessaries, and he would settle himself here
like a planter, waiting the good time when, if ever
I returned to England, I would redeem him, and
hoped» I would not be unmindful of him when I
came to England; that he would give me some let-
ters to his friends in London,‘ to let them know
how good I had been to him, and what part of the
W0_l‘l(l, and what circumstance, 1 had left him in;
that he promised me, that whenever I redeemed
him the plantation, and all the improvements he
made upon it, let the value be what it would,
should be wholly mine. ,
His discourse was very prettily delivered, con-
sidering his youth ; and was the more agreeable to
me, because he told me positively the match was
not for himself. I gave him all possible assurances
that if I lived to come safe to England, I would
deliver his letters, and do his business effectually,
and that he might depend I would never forget
the circumstance I left him in. But still I was im-
patient to know'who were the persons to be mar-
ried; upon which he told me it was my Jack of all
trades, and his maid Susan.
I was most agreeably surprised when he nam-
ed the match, for indeed I thought it very suit-
able. The character of that man I have given
already; and as for, the maid, she was a very ho-
nest, modest, sober,' and religious young woman;
had a very good share of sense, was agreeable
enough in her person, spoke very handsomely, and
to the purpose, always with decency and good man-
ners, and not backward tor-speak when any thing
required it, or impertinently forward to speak when
it was not"l1er business ; very handy and house-
wifely in any thing that was before her; an excel-
lent manager, and t indeed to have been govern-
ess to the whole "island. She knew very well how
to behave herself to, all kind of folks she had about
her, and to better, if she had found any there.
The match being proposed in this manner, we
married them the same day; and as I was father
at the altar, as I may say, and gave her away, so
I -gave her a portion, for I appointed her and h_er
husband a handsome, large space of ground for
their plantation; and indeed this match, and the
proposal the young gentleman made to me, to give
him a small property in the island, put me upon
parcelling it out among them, that they might not
quarrel afterwards about their situation.
This sharing out the land to them I left to Will
Atkins, who indeed was now grown a most sober,
grave, managing fellow, perfectly reformed, exceed-
ing pious and religious; and, as far as I may be al-
lowed to speak positively in such a case, I verily be-
lieve, was a true, sincere penitent.
He divided things so justly, and so much to
every one‘s satisfaction, that they only desired one
general writing; under my hand for the whole;
which I caused to be drawn up, and signed and
sealed to them, setting out the bounds and situa-
tion of every man's plantation, and testifying that
I gave them thereby severally a right to the whole
possession’-and inheritant-.e of the respective planta-
tions or l’arms, with their improvements, to them
and their heirs, reserving all the rest of the island
as my own property, and a certain rent for every
particular plantation, after eleven years, if I, or
any one from me, or in my name, came to de-
mand it, producing an attested copy of the same
writing. \
As to the government and laws among them, I
told them I was not capable of giving them better
rules than they were able to give themselves, only
made them promise me to live in love and good
neighbourhood with one another. And so 1 pre-
pared to leave them. 2
One thing I must not omit, and this is, that
being new settled in a kind of commonwealth
among themselves, and having much business in
hand, it was but odd to have seven-and-thirty In-
dians live in a nook of the island, independent, and
indeed unemployed; for, excepting the providing
themselves food, which they had difunlty enough
in too sometimes, they had no manner of business
or property to manage. I proposed, therefore, to
the governor Spaniard that he should go to them‘,
with Fridays father, and propose to them to re-
move, ‘and either plant for themselves, or take them
into their several families as servants, to be main-
rained for their labour, but without being absolute
slaves; for I would not admit them to make them
slaves by force, by any means, because they had
their liberty given them by capitulation, and, as it
were, articlesof surrender, which they ought not to
break.
They most willingly embraced the proposal, and
came all very cheerfully along with him. So we al-
lotted them land and plantations, which three or
four accepted of, but all the rest chose to be em-
ployed as servants in the several families we had
settled. And thus my colony was in a manner
settled, as follows: the Spaniards possessed my
original habitation, which was the capital city, and
extended their plantation all along the side of the
brook, which made the creek that I have so often
described, as far as my bower; and as they in-
creased their culture, it went always eastward. The
English lived in the north-east part, where Will
Atkins and his comrades began, and came on south-
ward, and south-west, towards the back part of the
Spaniards; and every plantation had a great addi-
tion of land to take in, if they found occasion, so
that they need not jostle one another for want 06
room. ' '
All the west end of the island was left uninha-
bited, that if any of the savages should come on
shore there, only for their usual, customary barba-
rities, they might come and go : if they disturbed
nobody, nobody would disturb them; and no doubt
but they were often ashore, and went away again,
for I never heard that the planters were attacked
or disturbed any more. _
r It now came into my thoughts, that I had hinted
to my friend the clergyman that the work of con-
verting the savages might perhaps be set on foot
in his absence, to his satisfaction; and I told him
that now I thought it was put in a fair way: for the
-savages being thus divided among the Christians,
jfitbey would but every one of them do their part
withlthose which came under their. hands, I hoped
it might have a very-good elfect.
He agreed presently in that, ‘ If,’ said he, ‘ they
will do their part; but how,’ says he, ‘ shall we ob-
fain that of them 2’ I told him we could call them
allvtogether, and leave it in charge with them,» or
go to them one by one, which he thought best. So
we divided it: he to speak to the Spaniards, who
were all papists; and I to the English, who were
all protestants; and we recommended it earnestly
to them, and made them promise, that they would
never make any distinction of papist or protestant,
in their exhorting the savages to turn Christians;
but teach them the general knowledge of the
true God, and of their Saviour Jesus Christ: and
they likewise promised us that they would never
have any differences or disputes, o_ne with another,
about religion. ‘
When I came to Will Atl<ins’s. house (I may- call
it _so, for such av house, or such a piece of basket-
work, I believe, was not standing in the world
again; I say, when I came thither), I found the
young woman I have mentioned above, and Wil-
liam Atkins’s wife, were become intimates, and this
prudent, religious young womanhad perfected the
work Will Atkins had begun; and though it was
not above four days after what I have related,
yet the new-baptized savage woman was made such
a Christian as I have seldom heard of any like
her, in all my observation or conversation in the
world. ~
It came next into my mind, in the morning before
I went to them, that, among all the. needful things
I had to leave with them, I had not left a Bible, in
which I showed myself less considering for them,
than my good friend the widow was for me, when"
she sent me the cargo of one hundred pounds from
Lisbon, where she packed up three Bibles and a
Prayer-Book. However, the good w0man’s charity
had a greater extent than ever she imagined; for
Y 2 "
they were reserved for the comfort and instruction
of those that made much better use of them than I
had done. ,
I took one of the Bibles in my pocket, and when
I came to William Atkins’s tent or house, and fourld
the young woman, and Atkins’s baptized wife,
had been discoursing of religion together (for Wil-
liam Atkins told me, with a great deal of joy), I
asked if they were together now, and he ~said,
‘ Yes.’ So I went into the house, and he with me,
and we found them together very earnest in dis-
course. ‘ O, sir,’ says William Atkins, ‘ when God
has sinners to reconcile to himself, and aliens to
bring home, he never wants a messenger. My wife
has got a new instructor. I knew I was unworthy,
as I was incapable of that work: that young wo-
man has been sent hither from heaven; she is
enough to convert a whole island of savages.’ The
young woman blushed, and rose up to go away, but
I desired her to sit still. I told her she had a good
work upon her hands, and I hoped God would
bless her in it.
We talked a little, and I did not perceive they
had any book among them, though I did not ask;
but I put my hand in my pocket, and pulled out
my Bible. ‘Here,’ said I, to Atkins, ‘ I have
brought you an assistant, that, perhaps, you had
not before.’ The man was so confounded that he
was not,able to speak for some time; hut, reco-
vering himself, he takes it with both his hands, and,
turning to his wife, ‘ Ilere, my dear,’ says he, ‘ did
not I tell you our God, though he lives above, could
hear what we said ? Here is the book I prayed for,
when you and I lcneeled down under the bush:
now God has heard us, and sent it.’ When he had
said thus, the man fell into such transports of a pas-
sionate joy, that between the joy of having it, and
giving God thanks for it, the tears ran down his
face like a child that was crying.
The woman was surprised, and was like to have
run into a mistake that none of us were aware of;
for she rmly believed God had sent the book upon
her husband’s petition. It is true, that providen-
tially it was so, and might be taken so in a conse-
quent sense; but I believed it would have been no
diicult matter, at that time, to have persuaded
the poor woman to have believed that an express
messenger came from heaven, on purpose to bring
that individual book. But it was too serious a matter
to suffer any delusion to take place; so I turned
to the young woman, and told her, we did not de-
sire to impose upon the new -convert in her rst
and more ignorant understanding of things, and
begged her to explain to her, that God may be very
properly said to answer our petitions, when,~in
the course of his providence, such things are, in a
particular manner, brought to pass, as we petition-
ed for; but we do not expect returns from hea-
ven in a miraculous and panticular manner, and
that it is out of mercy that it is not so-
This the young woman did afterwards effectual-
ly; so that there was, I assure you, no priestcraft
used here, and I should have thought it one of the
most unjustiable frauds in the world, to have had
it so; but the surprise of joy upon WillAtkins is
really not to be expressed; and there, we may be
sure, there was no delusion. Sure no man was ever
more thankful in the world for any thing of its
kind, than he was for this Bible; and, I believe,
never any man was glad of a Bible from a better
principle: and though he had been a most prol-
gate creature, desperate, headstrong, outrageous,
furious, and wicked, to a great degree; yet this
man is a standing rule to us all for the well in-
structing children, viz. that parents should never
give over to teach and instruct, or ever despair of
the success of their endeavours, let the children
be ever so obstinate, refractory, or, to appearance,
insensible of instruction; for if ever God in his
providence touches the consciences of» such, the
force of their education returns upon them, and
the early instruction of parents is not lost, though
it may have been many years laid asleep, but,
some time or other, they may nd the benet
of it.
Thus it was with this poor man, however igno-
rant he was, or divested of religion and Christian
knowledge. I-Ie found he had some to do with now
more ignorant than himself; and that the least
part ofthe. instruction of his good father that could
now come to his mind was of use to him.
Among the rest it occurred to him, he said, how
his father used to insist much upon the inexpres-
sible value of the Bible, the privilege and blessing
of it to nations, families, and persons; but he never
entertained the least notion of the worth of it till
now, when being to talk to heathens, savages, and
barbarians, he wanted the help of the written oracle
for his assistance. ’
The young woman was very glad of it also, Tor
the present occasion, though she had one, and so
had the youth on ‘board our ship, among their goods,
which were not yet brought on shore. And now
having said so many things of this young woman, I
cannot omit telling one story more of her and my-
self, which has something in it very informing and
remarkable. '
I have related to what extremity the poor young
woman was reduced ; how her mistress was starved
to death, and did die, on hoard that unhappy ship
we met at sea; and how the whole ship’s company
being reduced to the last extremity, the geutlewo-
man, and her son, and this maid, were rst hardly
used as to provisions, and, at last, totally neglected
and starved; that is to say, brought to the last ex-
tremity of hunger.
One day, being discoursing with her upon the
extremities they suffered, I asked her if she could
describe, by what she had felt, what it was to starve,
and how it appeared. She told me, she believ-
ed-she could ; and she told her tale very distinctly
th-usf
‘ First, sir,’ said she, ‘ we had for some days
fared exceedingly hard, and suffered very great hun-
ger; but now, at last, were wholly without food
of any kind, except sugar, and a little wine, and a.
little water. The rst day, after I had received no
food at all, I found myself, towards evening, rst
empty and sickish at my stomach, and nearer night
mightily inclined to yawning, and sleepy. I laid
down on a couch, in the great cabin, to sleep, and
slept about three hours, and awaked a little re-
freshed, having taken a glass of wine when I lay;
down. After being about three hours awake, it
being about ve o’cl0ck in the morning, I found
myself empty, and my stomach sickish again, and
laid down again, hut could not sleep at all, being
very faint and ill: and thus I continued all the
second day, with a strange variety, rst hungry,
then sick again, with reac-hings to vomit. The se-
cond night, being obliged to go. to bed again, with-
out any food more than a draught of fair water,
and being asleep, I dreamed I was at Barbadoes,
and that the market was mightily stocked with pro-
visions; that I bought some for my mistress, and
went and dined very heartily.
‘ I thought my stomach was as full after this, as
it would have been after, or at, a good dinner; but
when I awaked, I was exceedingly sunk in my spi-
ritsto nd myself in the extremity of famine. The
last glass of wine we had I drank, and put sugar
into it, because of its having some spirit to supply
nourishment; but there being no substance in the
stomach for the digestingoice to work upon, I
found the only eiiect of the wine was, to raise dis-
agreeable fumes from the stomach into the head;
and 1 lay, as they told me, stupid and senseless, as
one drunk,_for some time.
‘ The third day in the morning, after a night of
strange and confused, inconsistent dreams, and ra~
thcr dozing than sleeping, I awalced, ravenous and
furious with hunger; and I question, had not my
understanding returned and conquered it, I say, I
question whether, if I had been a mother, and had
had a little child with me, its life would have been
safe, or not.
‘ This lasted about three hours, during which
time I was twice raging mad, as any creature in
Bedlam, as my young master told me, and as he
can now inform you.
‘ In one of these ts of lunacy, or distraction,
whether by the motion of the ship, or some slip of
my foot, I know not, I fell down, and struck my
face against the corner of a pallet-bed, in which my
mistress lay, and, with the blow, the blood gushed
out of my nose; and the cabin~boy bringing me a
little bason, 1 sat down, and bled into it a great
deal : and as the blood ran from me, I came to my-
self, and the violence of the ame, or the fever, I
was in, abated, and so did the ravenous part of the
hunger. '
‘ Then I grew sick, and reached to vomit, but
could not, for I had nothing in my stomach to
bring up. After I had bled some time, I swooncd,
and they all believed I was dead; but I came to
myself soon after, and then had a most dreadful
pain in my stomach, not to be described; not like
the cholic, but a gnawing, eager pain for food ; and
towards night it went off, with a kind of .earnest
wishing, or longing for food, something like, as I
suppose, the longing of a woman with child. I
took another draught of water, with sugar in it, but
my stomach loathed the sugar, and brought it all
up again. Then I took a draught of water without
sugar, and that staid with me; and 1 laid me down
upon the bed, praying most heartily, that it would
please God to take me away, and, composing my
mind in hopes of it, I slumbcred awhile, and then
waking, thought myself dying, being light with va-
pours from an empty stomach. 1 recommended my
soul to God, and earnestly wished that somebody
would throw me into the sea.
‘ All this while my mistress lay by me, just, as I
thought, expiring; but bore it with much more pa-
tience than I, and gave the last bit of bread she
had left to her child, my young master, who would
not have talcen it, but she obliged him to eat it;
and, I believe, it saved his life.
‘ Towards the morning, I slept again ; and, rst,
when I awaked, I Fell into a violent passion of cry-
ing, and, after that, had a second t of violent hun-
ger, so that-I got up ravenous, and in a most
dreadful condition : had my mistress been dead, as
much as 1 loved her, I am certain I should have
eaten a piece of her flesh, with as much relish, and
as unconcerned, as ever I did the flesh of any crea-
ture appointed for food; and, once or twice, I was
going to bite my own arm. At last, I saw the
bason, in which was the blood I had bled at my
nose the day before: I ran to it, and swallowed it
with such haste, and such a greedy appetite, as if I
had wondered nobody had taken it before, and
afraid it should be taken from me now. I
‘Though after it was down, the thoughts of it
lled me with horror, yet it checked the t of hun-
ger; and I drank a draught of fair water, and was
composed and refreshed for some hours after it.
This was the fourth day, ‘and thus 1 held it till
towards night, when, within the compass of three
hours, I had all the several circumstances over
again, one after another; viz. sick, sleepy, eagerly
hungry, pain in the stomach, then ravenous again,
then sick again, then lunatic, then crying, then ra-
venous again; and so every quarter of an hour:
and my strength wasted exceedingly. At night I
laid me-down, having no comfort, but in the hope
that I should die before morning.
‘ All this night I had no sleep, but the hunger
was now turned into a disease, and I had a terri-
blecliolic and griping; wind, instead of food, hav-
ing found its way into the bowels: and in this con.-
dition I lay till morning, when I was surpris.<>d a
little with the cries and lamentations of my. young
master, who called out to me that his motlier was
dead. I lifted myself up a little, for I had not
strength to rise, but found she was not dead»,
though she was able to give very little signs of
life.
‘ I had then such convulsions i-n my stomach, for
want of some sustenance, that I cannot describe
them, with such frequent throes and pangs of ap~
petite, that nothing but the tortures of death can
imitate. And this condition I was in, when I
heard the seamen above cry out, A sail! a sail!
and halloo and jump about as if they were dis-
tracted. "
‘ I was not able to get off from the bed,_ and my
mistress much less; and my young master was so
sick, that I thought he had been expiring: so we
could not open ,the cabin door, or get any account
what it was that occasioned such ‘a combustion.
Nor had we had any conversation with the ship’s
company for two days, they having told us that
they had not a mouthful of any thing to eat in the
ship ; and they told us afterwards they thought
we had-been dead.
‘ It was this dreadful condition we were. in
when you were sent to save our lives; and how
you found us, sir, you know as well as I, and bet-
ter too.’
This was her own relation, and is such adistiuct
account of starving to death, as, Iconfess, I never
met with,and was exceedingly entertaining to me. I
am the rather apt. to believe it Lobe a true account,
because the youth gave me an account of a good
part of it; though l must own, not so distinct, and
so feelingly, as his maid; and the rather because,
it seems, his mother fed him at the price of her
own life. “ But the poor maid, though her constitu-
tion being stronger than that other mistress, who
was in years, and a weakly woman too, she might
struggle harder with it; I say, the poor maid
might be supposed to feel the extremity something
sooner than her mistress, who might be allowed to
keep the last bits something longer than she parted
with any to relieve the maid. No question, as the
case is here related, if our ship, or some other, had
not so providcntially met them, a few days more
would’ have ended all their lives, unless they had
prevented it by eating one another: and even that,
as their case stood, would have served them but
a little while, they being ve hundred leagues from
any land, or any possibility of relief, other than in
the miraculous manner it happened. But this is
by the way. I return to my disposition of things
among the people.
And, rst, it is to be observed here, that, for
many reasons, I did not think t to let them know
any thing of the sloop I had framed, and which I
thought of setting up among them; for I found, at
least, at my rst coming, such seeds of divisions
among them, that I saw plainly had I set up the
sloop, and left it among them, they would, upon
every light disgust, have separated and gone away
from one another, or, perhaps, have turned pirates,
and so made the island a den of thieves, instead of
a plantation of sober and religious people, as I in-
tended it to be ; nor did I leave the two pieces of
brass cannon that Ihad on board, or the two quar-
ter-deck guns, that my nephew took extraordinary,
for the same reason. I thought they had enough to
qualify them for a defensive war against any that
should invade them; but I was not to set them up
for an offensive war, or to encourage them to go
abroad to attack others, which, in the end, would
only bring ruin and destruction upon themselves,
and all their undertakings. I reserved the sloop,
therefore, and the guns, for their service another
‘way, as I shall observe in its place.
I have now done with the island. I loft them
all in good circumstances, and in a ourishing con-
dition, and went on board my ship again the fth
day of May, having been ve-and-twenty days
among them; and, as they were all resolved to stay
upon the island till I came to remove them, I_ pro-
mised to send some further relief from the Brasils,
if L could possibly nd an opportunity; and par-
ticularly I promised to send them some cattle,
such as sheep, hogs, and cows: for, as to the two
cows and calves which I brought from England,
we had been obliged, by the length of our voyage,
to kill them at sea, for want of hay to feed them.
The next day giving them a salute of ve guni
at parting, we set sail,‘and arrived at the bay of
All-Saints, in the Brasils, in about twenty-two days,
meeting nothing remarkable in our passage but
this,-that about three days after we sailed, being
becalmed, and the current setting strong: to the E.
IN. E. running, as it were, into a bay or gulf, on
the land side, we were driven something out of our
course; and once or twice our men cried, ‘ Land to
the westward ;’ but whether it was- the continent, or
islands, we could not tell by any means.
But the third day, towards evening, the sea
smooth, and the weather calm, we saw the sea, as
it were, covered, towards the land, with something
very black, not being able to discover what it was ;
but after some time, our chief mate going up the
main shrouds a little way, and looliing at them
with a perspective, cried out, it was an army. I
could not imagine what he meant by an army, and
spoke a little hastily, calling the fellow a fool, or
some such word. ‘ Nay, sir,’ said he, ‘ do not be
angry; for it is an army, and a fleet too: for, I be-
lieve there are a thousand canoes, and you may see
them paddle along, and they are coming towards
us too apace, and full of men. .
I was a little surprised then‘, indeed, and so
was my nephew, the captain; for lie had heard
-terrible stories of them in the island, and, hav-
ing never been in those seas before, he could
not tell what to think of it, but said, two or three
times, we should all be devoured. I must confess,
considering we were becalmed, and the current set
strong towards the -shore, I liked it the worse.
However, I bade him not to be afraid. but bring the
ship to an anchor, as soon as we came so near as to
know that we must engage them.
The weather continued calm, and they came on
space towards us; so I gave orders to come to an
anchor, and furl all our sails. As for the savages,
I told them they had nothing to fear but re; and
therefore they should get their boats out, and
fasten them, one close by the head, and the other
by the stern, and man them both well, and wait
the issue in that posture. This 1 did that the
men in the boats might be ready, with sheets and
buckets, to put out any re those savages might en-
deavour to x upon the outside of the ship. ’
In this posture we lay by for them, and, in a little
while, they came up with us; but never was such a
horrid sight seen by Christians. My mate was
much mistaken in his calculation of their number, I
mean of a thousand canoes; the most we could
make of them when they came up, being about a
hundred and six-and-twenty, and a great many of
them too; for some of them had sixteen or seven-
teen men in them, some more; and the least six
or seven.
When they came nearer to us, they seemed to
be struck with wonder and astonishment, as at a
sight which they had, doubtless, never seen before ;
nor could they at rst, as we afterwards under-
stood, know what to make of us. They came
boldly up, however, very near to us, and seemed
to go about, to row round us; but we called to
our men in the boats, not to let them come too
near them. -
This very order brought us to an engagement
with them, without our designing it; for ve or six
of their large canoes came so near our long boat,
that our men beckoned with their hands to them to
keep back, which they understood very well, and
went back; but, at their retreat, about fty ar-
rows came on board us from those boats, and
one of our men in the long boat was very much
wounded. it
I-Iowever, I called to them not to re by any
means; but we handed down some deal boards into
the boat, and the carpenter, presently set up a kind
of a fence, like waste boards, to cover thorn from
the arrows of the savages, it‘ they should shoot
again. I ‘ -
About half an hour afterwards they came all up
in a body astern of us, and pretty near, so near
that we could easily discern what they were,
though we could not tell their design. I easily
found they were some of my old friends, the same
sort of savages that I had been used to engage
with: and, in a little time more, they rowed some-
what farther out to sea, till they came directly
broadside with us, and then rowed down straight
upon us, till they came so near, that they could
hear us speak. Upon this, I ordered all my men
to keep close, lest they should shoot any more ar-
rows, and make all our guns ready; but, being so
near as to be within hearing, I made Friday go out
upon the deck, and call out aloud to them in his
language, to know what they meant, which accord-
ingly he did. Vllhether they understood him or
not, that I knew not; but as soon as he had called
to them, six of them, who were in the foremost or
nighest boat to us, turned their canoes from us,
and stooping down, showed us their naked back-
sides, just as if, in English (saving your presence),
they had bade us kiss ........Whethcr this was a do-
ance, or challenge, we know not; or whether it was
done in mere contempt, or as asignal to the rest,
but immediately Friday cried out, they were going
<0 shoot , and unhappily for him, poor fellow!
they let y about three hundred of their arrows,
and, to my inexpressible grief, killed poor Friday,
no other man being in their sight. The poor fellow
was shot with no less than three arrows, and about
three more fell very nigh him; such unlucky
marksmen they were.
I was so enraged with the loss of my old servant,
the companion of all my sorrows and solitudes,
that I immediately ordered ve guns to be loaded
with small shot, and four with great, and gave them
such a broadside as they had never heard in their
lives before, to "be sure.
They were not above half a cable's length on‘
when we red; and our gunners took their aim
so well, that three or four of their canoes were
overset, as we had reason to believe, by one shot
Only.
The ill manners of turning up their bare back-
sides to us, -gave us no great offence; neither did
I know for certain whether that which would pass
for the greatest contempt among us, might be un.
derstood so by them, or not; therefore, in return, I
had only resolved to" have red four or ve guns,
with powder only, which I"-knew would fright them
suiciently. But when they shot at us directly,
with all the fury they were capable of, and espe-
cially as they had killed my poor Friday, whom I
so entirely loved and valued, and who indeed so
well deserved it; I not only had been justied
before God and man, but would have been very
glad, if I could, to have overset every canoe there,
and drowned every one of them.
I can neither tell how many we killed, nor how
many we wounded, at this broadside; but sure
such afright and hurry never was seen among such
a multitude: there were thirteen or fourteen of
their canoes split, and overset, in all, and the men
all set a swimming; the rest, frighted out of their
wits, scoured away as fast as /they could, taking
but little care to save those whose boats were split
or spoiled wiph our shot. So I suppose thatthere
were many o them lost. And our men took up
one poor fellow swimming for his life, above an
hour after they were all gone.
Our small shot, from our cannon, must needs kill
and wound a great many; but, in short, we never
knew any thing how it went with them, For they ed
so fast, that, in three hours, or thereabouts, we
could not see above three or four straggling canoes;
nor did we ever-see the rest any more, for a breeze
of wind springing up the same evening, we weighed,
and set sail for the Brasils.
We had a prisoner indeed, but the creature was
so sullen, that he would neither eat nor speak, and
we all fancied he would starve himself to death.
But I took a way to cure him, for I made them
take him, and turn him into the longboat,‘ and
-make him believe they would toss him into the
sea again, and so leave him where they found him,
if he would not speak; nor would that do, but
they really did throw him into the sea, and came
away from him, and then he followed them, for he
swam like a cork, and called to them in his
tongue, though they knew not one word of what he
said. I-Iowever, at last, they took him in again,
and then he began to be more tractable; nor did I
ever design they should drown him.
We were now under sail again; but I was the
most diseonsolate creature alive, for want of my
man Friday, and would have been very glad to
have gone back to the island, to have taken one of
the rest from thence for my occasion, but it could
not be so : so we went on- We had one prisoner,
as I have said, and it was a long, while before we
could make him understand any thing; but, in
time, our men taught him seine English, and he
began to be a little tractable. Afterwards we in-
quired what country he came from, but could make
nothing of \vhat'he said, for his speech was so
odd, all gutturals, and spoken in the throat in such
a" hollow and odd manner, that we could never
form a word from him; and we were all of opinion
that they might speak that language as well if
they were gagged, as otherwise; nor co,uld we per-
ceive that they had any occasion either for ‘teeth,
tongue, lips, or palate; but formed their words
just as a hunting-horn forms a tune, with an open
throat. He told us, however, some time after,
when we had taught him to speak a little English,
that they were going with their kings to ght a
great battle. When he said kings, we asked him
how many kings. He said there were ve nation
(we could’ not make him. understand the plural s),
and that they all joined to go against two nation.
We asked him, what made them come up to us. He
said, ‘to makee te great wonder look.’ Where
it is to be observed, that all those natives, as
also those of Africa, when they learn English, they
always add two e’s at the end of the words where
we use one, and place the accent upon them, as
‘ makee, takee,’ and the like; and we could not
break them of it; nay, I could hardly make Fri-
day leave it off, though at last he did.
And now I name the poor fellow once more,I must
take my last lezwe of him. Poor honest Friday! we
buried him with all the decency and solemnity pos-
sible, by putting him into a coin, and throwing him
into the sea; and [caused them to re eleven guns
for him: and so ended the life of the most grateful,
faithful, honest, and most affectionate servant that
ever man had.
We now went away with a fair wind for Brasil,
and in about twelve days’ time we _n1ado land, in
the latitude of ve degrees south of the line, being
the north-easternmost land of all that part of Ame-
rica; We kept on S. by E. in sight of the shore
four days, when we made the cape Saint Augus-
tine, and in three days came to an anchor o' the
bay of All-Saints, the old place of my deliverance,
from whence came both my good and evil fate.
Never ship came to this part that had less busi-
ness than I had, and yet it was with great diiculty
that we were admitted to holdthe least~c‘orres'p_ond-
ence on shore.’ Not my partner himself, who was
alive, and made a great gure among them ; ‘not my
two merchant-trustees, nor the fame of my won-
derful preservation in the island, could obtain me
that favour: but my partner, remembering that I
had given ve hundred moidores to the prior of the
monastery of the Augustines, and three hundred
and seventy-two to the poor, went to the monai
stery,<and obliged the prior that then was, to gp
to the_ governor, and get leave for mefpresenjly,
with the captain, and one more, besides eigl3_t's§§5a}'%,r
men, to come‘ on shore, and no more; and fthié‘
upon condition, absolutely capitulated ,for,,that we
should not offer to land any goods out of"the,ship,
or to carry any person away without licence.
They were so strict with us, as to landing any
gopds, that it was with extreme di°1culty'that I
got on shore three balesof English goods, such as
ne broadcloths, stuffs, and some linen, which ‘I
had brought for a present to my partner.
I-Ie was a very generous, broad-hearted man,
though (like me) he came *om- little at rst; and
though he knew not that I had the least design of
giving him any thing, he sent me on board a pre-
sent _of fresh provisions, wine, and sweetmeats,
worth above thirty moidores, including some to-
bacco, and three or four ne medals in gold. But
I was even with him in my presents, which, as I
have said, consisted of ne broadcloth, English
stulfs, lace, and ne hollands. Also I delivered
him about the value of one hundred pounds ster-
ling, in the same goods, for other uses; and I
obliged him to set up the sloop which I had brought
with me from England, as I have said, for the use
of my colony, in order to send the refreshments I
intended to my plantation.
Accordingly he got hands, and nished the sloop
in a very few days, for she was already- framed,
and I gave the master of her such instructions as
he could not miss the place; nor did he miss it, as
I had an account from my partner afterwards. I
got him so_on loaded with the small cargo I had
sent them ; and one of our seamen, that had been
on shore with me there, offered to go with the
sloop, and settle there,_upon my letter to the go-
vernor Spaniard, to allot him a sufficient quantity
of lan_d for a. plantation; and giving him some
clothes, and tools for his planting-work, which he
said he understood, having been an old planter in
Maryland, and a buccaneer into the bargain.
I encouraged the fellow, by granting all he de-
sired; and, as an addition, I gave him the savage
which we had taken prisoner of war, to be his
slave; and ordered the governor Spaniard to give
him his share of every thing he wanted with the
rest. ‘ _
When we came to t this man out, my old part-
ner told me there was a certain very honest fellow,
a Brasil planter of his acquaintance, who had fallen
into the displeasure of the church, ‘ I know not
what the matter is with him,’ says he, ‘ but, on my
conscience, I think he is aheretic. in his heart; and
he has been obliged to conceal himself for fear of
the Inquisition; that he would be very glad of
such an opportunity to make his escape, with his
wife and two daughters; and if I would let them
go to my island, and allot them a plantation, he
would give them a small stock to begin with; for
the oicers of the Inquisition had seized all his
effects and estate, and he had nothing left but a.
little household stuff, and two slaves. And,’ adds
he, ‘ though I hate his principles, yet I would not
have him fall into their hands; for he will assuredly
be burnt alive, if he does.
I granted this presently, and joined my English-
man with them; and we concealed‘ the man, and
his wife and daughters, on board our ship, till the
Z
s
sloop put out to go to sea; and then‘ (having put
all their goods on board the sloop some time‘ before)
we put them on board the sloop, after she was got
out.of the bay. ’
Our scaman was mightily pleased with this new
partner; and their stock indeed was much alike
rich in tools, in preparations, and a farm, but
nothing to begin with, but as above. However, they
carried over with them (which was worth all the
rest) some materials for planting sugar-canes, with
some plants ocanes, which he, Ilmean the Portugal
man, understood very well.
Among the rest of the supplies sent my tenants
in the island, I sent them, by this sloop, three
milch cows, and ve calves, about twenty-two hogs
among them, three sows big with pig, two mares,
and a stone-horse.
For my Spaniards, according to my promise, I
engaged three Portugal women to go; and recom-
mended it to them to marry them, and use them
kindly. I could have procured more women, but I
remembered that the poor persecuted man had two
daughters, and there were but ve of the Spaniards
that wanted: the rest had wives of their own,
though in another country.
All‘ this cargo arrived safe, and,~as you may
easily suppose, very welcome to my old inhabit~
ants; who were now (with this addition) between
sixty and seventy people, besides littte-children,
of which there were agreat many. I found letters
at London from them, all by way of Lisbon, when I
came back to England, being sent back to the Bra-
ails, by this sloop: of which I shall take some no-
tice in its place. »
I have now done with my island, and all manner
of discourse about it; and whoever reads‘ the rest
of my memorandums would do well. to turn’ his
thoughts entirely from it, and expect to‘ read only
of the follies of an old man, not warned by his
awn harms, much less by those of other »!h€‘D, to
beware of the like: not cooled by almost Forty
years of misery and disappointments; not satis-
ed with prosperity beyond expectation; not made
cautious by affliction and distress beyond imitation.
I had no more business to go to the East Indies
than a man at full liberty, and having committed
no crime, has to go to the turnkey at Newgate, and
desire him to lock him up among the prisoners
there, and starve him. , Ilad I taken a small vessel
from England, and went directly to the island, had
I loaded her, as I did the other vessel, with all the
necessaries for the plantation, and, for my people,
took a patent from the government here, to have
secured my property, in subjection only to that of
England, which, to be sure, I might have obtained ;
had I carried over cannon and ammunition, serv-
ants, and people to plant, and, taking possession of
the place, fortied and strengthened it, in the
name of England, and increased it with people, as
I might easily have done; had I then settled my-
self there, and sent the ship back, loaden with good
rice, as I might also have done in six months’
time, and ordered my friends to have tted her out
again for our supply; had I done this, and staid
there myself, I had, at least, acted like a man of
common sense: but I was possessed with a wan-
dering spirit, scorned all advantages, pleased my-
self with being the patron of these people I had-
placed there, and doing for them in a kind of
haughty, majestic way, like an old patriarchal mo-
narch: providing for them, as if I had been father
of the whole family, as well as of thenplantation.
But I never so much as pretended to-plant in the
name of any government or nation, or to acknow-
ledge any prince, or to call my people subjects to
any one nation more than another; nay, I never so
much as gave the place a name, but left it as I
found it, belonging to no man, and the people un-
der no discipline or government but my own, who,
though I_ had an inuence over them as father
and benefactor, had no authority or power to act
or command one way or other, farther than volun-
tary consent moved them to comply; yet even
this, had I staid there, would have done well
enough; but as I rambled from them, and came
thither no more, the last letters I had from any of
them, were by my partncr’s means, who afterwards
sent another sloop to the place, and who sent me
word, though I had not the letter till ve years
after it was written, that they went on but poorly ;
were malcontent with their long stay there; that
WillAtkins was dead; that ve of the Spaniards
were come away; and that though they had not
been much molested by the savages, yet they had
had some skirmishes witlrthem; that they begged
of him to write to me, to think of the promise I
had made to fetch them away, that they might sec
their own country again before they died.
But I was gone a wild-goose chase indeed, and
they who will -haveany more ‘of me, must be con-
tent to follow me through a new variety of follies,
hardships, and wild adventures, wherein the justice
of Providence may be duly observed, and we may
see how easily heaven can gorge us with our own
desires, make the strongest of our wishes to be our
aliction, and punish us mostisevercly with those
very things which we think it would be our utmost
happiness to be allowed in.
Let no wise man atter himself with the strength
of his own judgement, as if he was able to choose
any particular station of life for himself. Man is
a short-sighted creature, sees but a. very little way
before him; and as his passions are none of his best
friends, so his particular affections are generally his
worst counsellors. "
I say this, with respect to the impetuous desire
I had, from a youth, to wander into the world;
and how evident it now was, that this principle
was preserved .in me for my punishment. How it
ea-me .on, the manner the circumstance, and the
conclusion of it, it is‘ easy to give. you historically,
and with its utmost variety of particulars. But the
secret ends of Divine Providence, in thus permit-
ting us to be hurried down the stream of our own
desires, are only to be understood of those who can
listen to the voice of Providence, and draw religious
consequences from God's justice, and their own
mistakes. -
Be it I had business, or no business, away I
went; it is no time now to enlarge any farther
upon the reason or absurdity of my own conduct:
but, to come to the history, I was <-?1n~barked for the
voyage, and the voyage I went.
I should only add here, that my honest and truly
pious clergyman left me here; a ship being ready
to go to Lisbon, he asked me leave to go thither,
being still, as he observed, bound never to nish
any voyage he began. Ilow happy had it been for
me, if I had gone with him!
But it was too late now: all things Heaven ap-
points are best. Had I gone with him, I had never
had so many things to be thankful for, and you
had never heard» of the second part’ of the travels
and adventures of Robinson Crusoe; ~ so I must
leave here the fruitless exclaimiug at myself, and
go on with my voyage. -
From the Brasils we made directly away over the
Atlantic Sea, to the Cape do Bonne Esperance, or,
as we call it, the Cape of Good I-lope ; and hail a
tolerable good voyage, our course generally south-
east: now and then a storm, and some contrary.
winds. But my disasters at sea were at an end:
my future rubs and cross events were to befall
me on shore, that it might appear the land was as
well prepared to be our scourge as the sea, when
Heaven, who directs the circumstances of things,
pleases to appoint it to be so.
Our ship was on a trading voyage, and had a
supercargo on board, who was to direct all her mo-
tions, after she arrived at the Cape, only being
,4-v
limited to certain numbers of days for stay, by
charterparty, at the several ports she was to go
to. This was none of my business, neither did I
meddle with it at all: my nephew, the captain,
and the supercargo, adjusting all those things be-
tween them, as they thought t.
We made no stay at the Cape, longer than was
needful to take in fresh water, but made the best of
our way for the coast of Coromandel : we were in-
deed informed that a French man of war, of fty
guns, and two large merchant ships, were gone
for the Indies; and as I knew we were at war with
France, I had some apprehensions of them; but
they went theinown way, and we hoard no more of
them. - ‘"
_ I shall not pester my €lC(‘0tll'1ll,‘OI‘ the readrr,
with descriptions of places, journals of ourvoyagcs,
variations of the compass, latitudes, meridian di-
stances, trade-winds, situation of ports, and the
like; such as almost all the histories of long navi-
gation are full of, and which make the reading tire-
some enough, and are perfectly unprotable to all
that read, except only to those who are to go to
those places themselves.
It is enough to name the ports and places which
we touched at; and what occurred to us upon our
passing from one to another. We touched rst at
the island of Madagascar, where, though the peo-
ple are erce and treacherous, and, in particular,
very well armed with lances and bows, which they
use with inconceivable dexterity; yet we fared very
well with them a while :' they treated us very
civilly, and, for some tries which we gave them,
such as knives, scissars, &c. they brought us eleven
good fat bullocks, middling in size, but very good
in esh, which we took in, partly for fresh provi-
sions for our present spending, and the rest to salt
for the ship’s use.
We were obliged to stay here for some time after
we had furnished ourselves with provisions, and I,
‘Q
that was always too curious to look into every
nook of the world wherever I came, was for going
on shore as often I could. It was on the east
side of the island that we went on shore one
evening, and the people, who, by the way, are very
numerous, came thronging about us, and stood ing at us, at a distance. As we had traded.freely
with them, and had been kindly used, we thought
ourselves in no danger ; but when wesaw the peo-
ple, we, out three boughs out of a tree, and stuck
them up at a distance from us, which, it seems, is
a mark in that country, not only of truce and friend-
ship, but when it is accepted, the other side set up
three poles, or bonghs, also, which is a signal that
they accept the truce too; but then this is a known
condition ol’ the truce, that ydu are not to, pass be-
yond their three poles towards them, 1101' they
come past your three poles, or boughs, towards
you; so that you are perfectly secure within the
three poles, and all the space between your poles
and theirs, is allowed likoa market, for free con-
verse, traic, and commerce. When you go thither,
you must not carry your weapons with you; and
il’ they come into that space, they stick up their
javelins and lances all at the rst poles, and come‘
on unarmed: but if any violence is offered them,
and the truce thereby broken’, away they run to the
poles, and lay hold of their weapons, and then the
truce is at an end». _
It happened one evening, when we went on shore,
that a greater number of their people ‘came down
than usual; but were all very friendly and civil.
They brought with them several kinds of provi-
sions, for which we satised them, with such toys
as we had: their women also brought us milk and
roots, and several things very acceptable-to us; and
all was quiet. And we made us a little tent, or
hut, of some boughs of trees, and lay on shore all
that night.
I know not what was the occasion, but I_ was not
-
so well satised to die on shore as the rest; anti
the boat lying at an anchor, about a stone’s east
from the land, with two men in her to take care of
her, I made one of them come on shore, and
getting some boiiglis of trees to cover us also in
the boat, I spread the sail on the bottom of the
boat, and lay on board, under the cover of the
branches of the trees, all night.
About two o’clock in the morning we heard one
of our men making a terrible noise on the shore,
calling out, for God's sake, to bring the boat in,
and come and help them, for they were all like to
be murdered: at the same time I heard the ring
of ve muskets, which was the number of the
guns they had, and that three times over; for, it
seems, the natives here were not so easily frighted
with guns as the savages were in America, where I
had to do with them.
All this while I knew not what was the matter,
butaousing immediately from sleep with the noise,
I caused the boat to be thrust in, and resolved,
with three fusils we had on board, to land, and
assist our men. '
We got the boat soon‘ to the shore, but our
men were in too much haste, for being eome to
the shore, they plunged into the water, to get to
the boat with all the ‘expedition they could, being
pursued by between three and four hundred men.
Our men were but nine in all, and only ve of
them had fusils with them: the rest indeed had pis-
tols and swords, but they were of small use to them.
We took up seven of our men, and with diffi-
culty enough too, three of them being very ill
wounded; and that which was still worse was, that
while we stood in the boat ‘to take our men in,
we were in as much danger as they were in on
shore, for theyipoured their arrows in upon us
so thick, that we were fain to barricade the side
of the boat up with the benches, and two or three
loose boards, which, to our great satisfaction, we
had, by mere accident, or Providence rather, in the
boat.
And yet,‘ had it been daylight, they are, it seems,
such exact marksmen, that if they could have seen
.but the least part of any of us, they would have been
sure of us. We had, by the light of the moon, a
little sight of them, as they stood pelting us from
the shore with darts and arrows; and having got
ready our re-arms, we gave them a volley, and we
could hear by the cries of some of them, that we
hadwounded several. However, they stood thus
.iu battle array on the shore till break of day, which
we suppose was, that they might see the better to
take their aim at us.
In this condition we lay, and could not tell how
to weigh our anchor, or set up our sail, because we
must needs stand up in the boat, and they were as
sure to hit us, as we were to hit a bird in___a tree
with small shot. We made signals ofdistress to
the ship, which, though she rode a league off, yet
my nephew, the captain, hearing our ring, and, by
glasses, perceiving the posture we lay in, and that
.we4 red towards the shore, pretty well understood
us; and weighing anchor with all speed, he stood
as near the shore as he durst with the ship, and
then sent another boat, with ten hands in her, to
assist us; but we called to them not to come too
near, telling them what condition we were in.
Ilowever, they stood in nearer to us: and one of
the men, taking the end of a tow-line in his hand,
and keeping our boat between him and the enemy,
so that they could not perfectly see him, swam on
board us, and made fast the line to the boat, upon
which we slipped our little cable, and leaving our
anchor behind, they towed us out of the reach of
the arrows, we all -the while lying close behind the
barricade we had made. i
As soon as we were got from between the ship
and the shore, that she could lay her side to the
shore, we ran along just by them, and we poured
Z 2
in a broadside among them, loaden with pieces of
iron and lead, small bullets, and such stuff, besides
the great shot, which made a terrible havoc among
them. '
When we were got on board, and out of danger,
we had time to examine into the occasion of this
fray, and indeed our supercargo, who had been
often in those parts, put me upon it; for he said
he was sure the inhabitants would not have touch-
ed us, after we had made a truce, if we had not
done something to provoke them to lt. At length
it came out, viz. that an old woman, who had
come to sell us some milk, had brought it within
our poles, with a young woman with her, who also
brought some roots or herbs ; and while the old wo-
man (whether she was mother to the young woman
or no, they could not tell) was selling us the milk,
one of our men offered some rudeness to the
Wench that was with her, at which the old woman
made a great noise. However, the seaman would
not quit his prize, but carried her, out of the old
woman’s sight, among the trees, it being almost
dark ; the old woman went away without her, and,
as we suppose, made an outcry among the people
she came from, who, upon notice, raised this great
army upon us, in three or four hours: and it was
great odds but we had been all destroyed.
Ono of our men was killed with a lance that was
thrown at him, just at the beginning of the attack,
as he sallied out of the tent we had made; the
rest came off free, all but the fellow who was the
occasion of all the mischief, who paid dear enough
for his black mistress, for we could not hear what
became oi’ him a great while. We lay upon the
shore two days after, though the wind presented,
and made signals for him; made our boat sail
up shore, and down shore, se_veral leagues, but in
vain. So we were obliged to give him over; and
if he alone had suered for it, the loss had been
le less. -
I could not satisfy myself, however, without
venturing on shore once more to try if I could
learn any thing of him or them. It was the third
nightafter the action that I had a great mind to
learn, if I could, by any means, what mischief we
had done, and how the game stood on the Indian
side. I was careful to do it in the dark, lest we
should be attacked again; but I ought indeed to
have been sure, that the men I' went with had been
under my command,_before I engaged in a thing so
hazardous and mischievous, as Iwas brought into it
without my knowledge or design.
We took twenty stout fellows with us as any in
the ship, besides the supcrcargo and myself; and
we landed two hours before midnight, at the same
place where the Indians stood drawn up the even-
ing before. I landed here, because my design, as
I have said, was chiefly to see if they had qnitted
the eld, and if they had left any marks behind
them, or of the mischief we had done them ; and I
thought, if we could surprise one or two of them,
perhaps we might get our man again, by way of
exchange.
We landed without any noise, and divided our
men into two companies, whereof the boatswain
commanded one, and I the other. We neither
could hear, nor see any body stir, when we landed;
so we marched up, one body at a distance from the
other, to the eld of battle. At rst we could see.
nothing, it being very dark; but, by and by, our
boatswain, that led the rst party, stumbled, and
fell over a dead body. This made them halt a
while, for knowing by the circumstances, that they
were at the place where the l-ndians had stood,
they waited for my coming .up. Ilere we conclud-
ed to halt till the moon began to rise, which we
knew would he in less than an hour; and then
we could easily discern the havoc we had made
among them. We told two-and-thirty bodies upon
the ground, whereof two were not quite dead. Some
516 nomusou oavsoh.
had an arm,_ and some a leg, shot oil’, and one .-his
head. Those that were wounded, we supposed they-
liadcarriod away. '
When we had made, as I thought, a full dis-
co\<ery of all we could come at the knowledge of,
I was for going on board again; but the boatswain
and his party often sent me word, that they were
resolved to make a visit to tho Indian town, whore
those dogs, as they called them, dwelt; and do-,
sired me to go along with them: and if they could
nd them, as they still fancied they should, they.
did not doubt. they said, getting a good booty; and-
it might be, they niighit, (ind Thomas J eifrys there;
that was the man's nzunegivo had lost.»
I-Iad they sent to ask my leave to go, Iknow
well enough what answer to have given them, for
I would have coinmanded them instantly on board,
knowing it was not a hazard t for us to run, who
iiad a ship, and ship’s loading, inour charge; and a.
voyage to make, which depended very much upon
tho lives of the men; but as they sent mo word.
they were resolved to go, and only asked me and;
my company to go along with them, I positively,
refused it, and roso up (for I was sitting -on the
ground) in order to go to the boat. Ono or two of
the uien began to importuno me to go, and, when I
still refused positively, began to p;run1blu, and say-,
they were not under my command, nndtlioy would
go. ‘ Come, Jaok,’ says one of the men, ‘ will you»
go withnw? I'll go for one..f. Jack said ho would,
and another followed, and then another, and, in a
word, they all loft mo but one, whom, svith much
diiculty too, I p_§n'siia<lod to stay ; so the snpercargo*
and I, with the third man, w el1'tlbzL(‘k\t0 the boat, where
I told thorn we would stay for thorn, and take cure
to take in as many lot‘ them us~should‘ be lolit; for I-
told thorn it was a mad tiring they were goingabout.
and supposed most of them would run tho fate of
'fl‘hoinns'Jcil'rys. i "' '~
i ’-l'll"y Bold mo, like seamen, they would \V'l‘l‘(lliI1I
it they would come oil’ again, and they would take
care, 8cc.- So away they went. I entrcnted them
to consider the ship, and the voyage; that their
lives were not their own, and that they were in-
trusted with the voyage, in some measure; that if
they miscarried, the ship might be lost l"'or_want ot"
their help, and that they could not answer it to
God and man. I said a great deal more to them on
that head, but I might as well have tallied to the
mainmast of the Ship, they were mad upon their
jourlley, only they gave mo good words, and begged
I would not be angry ; said they would he very cau~
tious, and that they did not doubt hut they would be
back again in about an hour at fartliest; for the In-
dian town, they said, was notubove halt‘ a mile oil:
though they found it above two miles before they
got to it.
Well, they all went away, as above; and though
the attempt was desperate, and such as none but
madman would have gone about, yet, to give them
their due, they went about it warily, as well as
boldly. They were gallantly armed, that is true,
for tliey had every man a fusil, or musket, it bay-
onet, and every man a pistol. Some of them
had broad cutlasses, some of them hangers; and
the boatswain, and two morn, had pole-axes: he-
sidcs all which, they had among them thirteen
hand-grenadoes. Bolder fellows, and better pro-
vided, novor went about any wltzkud work in the
world.
When they went out, their chief‘ design was plun-
der, and they were in mighty hopes of nding gold
there; but a circumstance, which none of them
were aware of, set them on ro with revenge, and
made devils of them all. When they ciunc to the
few Indian houses, wliitzh they thought had been
the town, which were not above half a mile oh", they
were under u great disappointment, For there were
not above twelve or thirteen houses, and who-ro tho
town was, or how big, l.l1cyltnt:‘\V not, ']j},,»y con,
suited, therefore, what to do, and were some time
before they could resolve; for if they fell upon
these, they must cut all their throats, and it was
ten to one but some of them might escape, it being
in the night, though the moon was up,.and if one
escaped, he would run away, and raise all the
town, so they should have a ‘whole army upon
them. Again, on the other hand, if they went
away, and left those untouched (for the people
were all asleep), they could not tell which way to
look for the town. i
I-lowcvcr, the last was the best advice; so they
resolved to leave those houses, and look for the
town as well as they could. They went on a little
way, and found a cow tied to a tree; this they pre-
sently concluded would be a good guide to them,
for they said the cow certainly belonged to the
town before them, or the town behind them: and if
they untied her, they should see which way she
went: it‘ she wont hack, they had nothing to say to
her; but, it‘ she went forward, they had nothing to
do but to follow her. So they cut the cord, which
was made of twisted ags, and the cow wont on
before them. In a word, the cow led them‘ di-
rectly to the town, which, as they reported, con-
sisted of above two hundred houses, or huts, and,
in some of these, they found several families living
together. ,
Here they found all silent, as profoundly secure
as sleep, and a country that had never seen an
enemy ol’ that kind,‘ could make them. Upon this
they called another council, to consider what they
had to do, and, in a word, they resolved to divide
themselves into three bodies, and to set three houses
on lire, in three parts of the town; and as the men
came out, to seize them and bind them; if any ro-
sisted, they need not be asked what to do then:
and so to search the rest of the houses for plun-
der; but they resolved to march silently rst
through the town, and seewhat dimensions it was cl‘,
\
and consider if they might venture, upon it, or
no.
They did so, and desperately resolved that they
would venture upon them; but while they were
animating one another to the work, three of them
that were a little before the rest, called out aloud,
and told them that they had found Thomas Jef-
frys. They all ran up to the place, and so it was
indeed, for there they found the poor fellow hang-
ed up, naked, by one arm, and his throat cut.
There was an Indian house. just by the tree, where
they found sixteen or seventeen of the principal
Indians who had been concerned in the fray with
us before, and two or three of them wounded with
our shot; and our men found they were awake,
and talking one to another in" that house, but
knew not their number.
The sight of ‘their poor, mangled comrade so en-
raged them, as before, that they swore to one ano-
ther they would be revenged, and that not an In-
dian who came into their hands should have quar-
-ter: and to work they wentinmiediately; and yet
not so-madly as, by the rage and fury they were in,
might be expected. - Their first care was to get
so1nething' that would soon take re; but after a
little search, they found that would be to no pur-
pose, for most of the houses were low, and thatch-
ed with flags or rushes, of which the country is
full. So they presently made some wilcllire, as we
call it, by wetting a little powder, in the palms of
their hands, and, in a quarter of an hour, they set
the town on re, in four or ve places ; and par-
ticularly that house where the Indians were not
gone to bed. As soon as the lire began to blaze,
the p001‘, frighted creatures began to rush out to
save their lives; but met with their fate in the at-
tempt, and esyeeially at the door, where they drove
them back, the boatswain himself killing one or two
with his pole-axe; the house being large, and many
in it, he did not care to go in, but called for a
hand-grenade, and threw it among them, which, at
rst, frighted them; but when it burst, made such
havoc among them, that they cried out in a hideous
manner. ”
= In short, mostlof the Indians who were in the
open part of the house, were killed or hurt with the
grenade, except two or three more, who pressed to
the door, which the boatswain, and two more, -kept
with their bayonets in the muzzles of their pieces,
and dispatched all who came that way. But there
was another apartment in the house, where the
prince, or king, or whatever he was, and several
others, were; and these_ they kept in till the house,
which was, by this time,’ all of a light ame, fell in
upon them, and they were smothered, or burned
together. - '
All this while they red not a gun, because they
would not waken the people faster than they could
master them; but the re began to waken them
fast enough, and our fellows were glad to keep a
little together in bodies, for the re grew so raging,
all the houses being made of light, combustible
stuff, that they could hardly bear the street between
them: and their business was to follow the re for
the surer execution. As fast as the re either forced
the people out of those houses which were burning,
or frighted them out of others, our people were
ready at their doors to knock them on the head,
still calling and hallooing to one another to remem-
ber Thomas Jeffrys.
While this was doing, I must confess I was very
uneasy, and especially when 1 saw the ames of
the town, which, it being niglit, seemed to be just
by me. ..
My nephew, the captain, who was roused by his
men too, seeing such a lire, was very uneasy, not
knowing what the matter was, or what danger I was
in, especially hearing the guns too‘§ for, by this
time, they began to use their re-arms. A thousand
thoughts oppressed his mind concerning me and the
supercargo, what should become of us. And, at
last, though he could ill spare any more men, yet
not knowing what exigenee we might be in, he takes
another boat, and, with thirteen men and himself,
comes on shore to me.
He was surprised to see me and the supercargo in
the boat, with no more than two men, for one had
been left to keep the boat; and though he was glad
that we were well, yet he was in the same impa-
tience with us to know what was doing; for the
noise continued, and the ame increased. in short,
it was next to an impossibility for any men in the
world to restrain their curiosity of knowing what
had happened, or their concern for the safety of
the men. In a word, the captain told me he would
go and help his men, let what would eome. I arl
gued with him, as I did before with the men,
the safety of the ship, the danger of the voyage,
the interest of the owners and merchants, &c.
and told him, I would go, and the two men,
and only see if we could, at a distance, learn what
was like to be the event, and come bael<,and tell him.
It was all one to talk to my nephew, as it was to
talk to the rest lieforo. IIe would go, he said, and
he only wished he had left but ten men in the ship ;
for he could not think of having his men lost for
want of help: he had rather, he said, lose the ship,
the voyage, and his life, and all; and so away
went he. _
Nor was I any more able to stay behind now,
than I was to persuade them not to go before; so,
in short, the captain ordered two men to row back
the pinnace, and fetch twelve men more from the
ship, leaving the long boat at an anchor, and that
when they came back, six men should keep the two
boats, and six more come after us; so that he left
only sixteen men in the ship: for the whole ship's
company consisted of sixty-live men, whereof two
\vm‘e lost in the rst quarrel, which brought this
mischief on.

co
ROBINSON CRUSOE;
Being now on the march, you may be sure we
felt little of the ground we trod on, and, being guid~
ed by the re, we kept no path, but went directly to
the place of the ame. If the noise of the guns
were surprising to us’ before, the cries of the poor
people were now quite of another nature, and lled
us with horror. I must confess I never was at the
sacking of a city, or at the taking of a town by
storm; I have heard of Oliver Cromwell taking
Drogheda in Ireland, and killiugman; woman, and
child; and I had read of eount.'l.‘illy sacking of the
city of Magdeburgh, and cutting the throats of
twenty-two thousand, of both sexes; but I never
had an idea of the thing itself before, nor is it pos-
sible to describe it, or the horror which was upon
our minds at hearing it.
However, we went on, and atlength came tothe
town, though there was no-entering the streets of it
for the re. The rst object we met with was the
ru-ins of a» hut, or house, or rather the ashes oi‘ it,
for the house was consumed; and just before it,
plain now to be seen by the light of the re, lay
four, men and three women killed, and, as we
thought, one or two more lay in the heap among the"
re. In short, there were such instances oi’ a rage
altogether barbarous,.and of a fury something be-
yond what was human, that we thought it impossi~
bile our men could be guilty of it; or, if they were
the authors of it, we thought that every one of them
ought to be put to the worst of deaths. But this
was not all: we saw the re increased forward, and
the cry went on just as the re went on, so that we
were in the utmost confusion. We advanced a
little way farther, and beheld, to our astonishment,
three women, naked, crying in a most drea,dl"ul man-
ner, and ying, as if they had indeed‘ had wings,
and after them sixteen or seventeen men, natives,
in the same terror and consternation, with three of
our English butchers (for I can call them no better)
in their rear, who, when they could not o.vertu.ke~
them, red in among them, and one that was
killed by their shot fell _down in our sight.
When the rest saw us, believing us to be their
enemies, and that we would murder tliem, as
Well as those that pursued them, they set up a
most dreadful shriek, especially the women ; and
two of them fell down as if already dead with the
fright. ,
My very soul shrunk within me, and my blood
ran chill in my veins, when I saw this; and, I be-
lieve, had the three English sailors that pursued
them come on, I had made our men kill them all.
However, we took some ways to let the poor, ying
creatures know that we would not hurt them, and
immediately they came up to us, and kneeling
down, with their hands lifted up, made piteous la-
mentation to us to save them, which we let them
know we would do, whereupon they kept all to-
gether in a huddle, close behind us, for protection.
I left my men drawn up together, and charged them
to hurt nobody, but, if possible, to get at some of
our people, and see what devil itwas possessed‘
them, and what they intended to do, and, in a
word, to eoinmandthem off, assuring them that if
they staid till daylight, they would have a hundred
thousand men about their ears ; I say, I left them,
and went among those ying people, taking. only-
two of our men with me; and there was indeed a
piteons, spectacle among them. Some of them had"
their feet terribly burned with trampling and run-
ning through the re ; others, their hands burned ;
one of the women had fallen down in the re, and
was almo'st burned to death before she could get
out again; two or three of the men had cuts in
their backs and thighs,_fro1n our men pursuing; and
another was shot through the body, and died while
I was there.
I would fain have learned what the occasion of
all this was; but I could not understand one word
they said, though, by signs, I pe1'eei\'od that some
‘ .
of them knew not what was the occasion them-
selves. I was so tcrriedin my thoughts at this out-
rageous attempt, that I could not stay there, but
wont back to my own men. I told them my reso-
lution, and commanded them to follow me, when,
in the very moment, came four of our men, with
the boatswain at their head, running over the heaps
of bodies they had killed, all covered with blood
and dust, as if they wanted more people to mas-
sacre, when our men hallooed to them as loud as
they could halloo, and, with much ado, one ol’
them made them hear: so that they knew who we
were, and came up to us.
As soon as the boatswain saw us, he set up a hal-
loo, like a shout of triumph, for having, as he
thought, more help come; and, without bearing to
hear me, ‘ Captain,’ says he, ‘ noble captain, I am
glad you are come: we have not half done yet.
Villains! hell-hound dogs! I’ll kill as many of
them as poor Tom has hairs upon his head. We
have sworn to spare none of them; we’l1 root out
the very nation of them from, the earth!’ and thus
he ran on, out of breath too with action, and would
not give us leave to speak a word.
At last, raising my voice, that I might silence him
a little, ‘ Barbarous dog !’ said I, ‘ what are you do~
ing? I won’t have one creature touched more,
upon pain of death. I char_E;e you, upon your life,
to stop your hands, and stand still here, or you are
a dead man thisrninute.’
_ ‘ Why, sir,’ says he, ‘ do you know what you do,
or what they have done? If you want a reason for
what we have done, come hither;’ and with that
he showed me the poor fellow hanging upon a tree,
‘with his throat cut.
I confess I was urged then myself, and at another
time should have been forward enough; but I
thought they had carried their rage too far, and
thought of Jacob’s words to his sons Simeon and
Levi, ‘ Cursed be their anger, for it was erce ; and
or
their wrath, for it was cruel!’ But I had new a new
task upon my hands, for when the men I carried
with me saw the sight, as I had done, I had as
much to do to restrain them, as I should have had
with the others; nay, my nephew himself fell in
with them, and told me, in their hearing, that he
was only concerned for fear of the men being
oirerpowered, for, as to the people, he thought not
one of them ought to live, for they had all glutted
themselves with the murder of the poor man, and
that they ought to be used like murderers. Upon
these words away ran eight of my men, with the
boatswain and his crew, to complete their bloody
work; and I, seeing it quite out of my power to
restrain them, came away pensive and sad; for I
could not bear the sight, much less the horrible
noise and cries; of the poor wretches that fell into
their hands.
I got nobody to eomelybaclc with me, ' but the
supercargo and two men; and with these I walked
back to the boats. It was a very great piece of
folly in me, I confess, to venture back, as it were,
alone; ‘for as it began now to be almost day, and
the alarm had run over the country, there stood
about forty men, armed with lanees and bows, at
a little place, where the twelve or thirteen houses
stood, mentioned before; but by accident I missed
the place, and came directly to the sea-side, and by
that time,I got to the sea-side, it was broad day.
I mmediately_ 1 took the pinnaee, and went aboard,
and sent her back to assist the men in what might
happen. I , .
‘I observed that about the time I came to the
boat side, the re was pretty well out, and the
noise abated; but in about half an hour after I got
on board, I heard a volley of our men’s re-arms,
and saw a great smoke: this, as I understood after-
wards, was our men falling upon the forty men,
who, as I said, stood at the few houseson the way,
of whom they killed sixteen or seventeen, and set
all those houses on re, but did not meddle with
the women or children. ~
By that time the men got to the shore again with
the pinnaee, our men began to appear ;__, they came
dropping in, some and some, not in two bodies, and
in form, as-they went out, but all in heaps, strag-
gling here and there, in such a manner that a
small force of resolute men might have cut thefn
all off.
But the dread of them was upon the whole coun-
try. The people were amazed and surprised, and
so frighted that, I believe, a hundred of them
would have ed at the sight of but ve of our men.
Nor in all this terrible action was there a man who
made any considerable defence; they were so sur~
prised between the terror of the re, and the suds
den attaclp of our men in the dark, that they knew
not which way to turn themselves; for -if they ed
one way, they were met, by one party, if back
again, by another, so that they were every where
knocked down. Nor did any of our men receive
the least hurt, except one who strained his foot,
and another had one of his hands very much
burned. A -
I was very angry with my nephew, the captain,
and indeed with all the men, in my mind, but
with him in particular, A as well for his acting so out
of his duty, as commander of the ship, and having
the charge of the voyage upon him, as in -his
prompting, rather than cooling, the rage of hismen,
in so bloody and cruel an enterprise. My nephew
answered me very respectfully, but told me, that
when he saw the body of the poor seaman, whom
they had murdered in such a cruel and barbarous
manner, he was not master of himself, neither
could he govern his passion. He owned he should
not have done so, as he was commander of the
ship; but as he was a man, and nature moved him,
he-could not bear it. As for the rest of the men,
they were not subject to me at all, and they knew
it well enough; so they took no notice of my
dislike.
The next day we set sail, so we never heard
any more of it. Our men differed in the account
of the number they killed; some said one thing,
some another: but, according to the best of their
accounts put all together, they killed, or destroy-
ed, about one hundred and fty people, men, wo-
men, and children, and left not a house standing
in the town.
As for the poor fellow, Thomas Jeffrys, as he
was quite dead, for his throat was so cut that his
head was half off, it would do him no service to
bring him away; so they left him where they
found him, only took him down from the tree
where he was hanged by one hand.
Ilowevet just our men thought this action to be,
I was against them in it, and I always, after that
time, told them God would blast the voyage; for I
looked upon the blood they shed that night to be
murder in them: for though it is true that they
killed Thomas J effrys, yet as it was true that J effrys
was the aggressor, had broken the truce, and had
violated, or debauched, a young woman of theirs,
who came to our camp innocently, and on the faith
of their capitulation. '
_ The boatswain defended this quarrel when we
were afterwards on board. He said it was true
that we seemed to break the truce, but really had
not; and that the war was begun the night before,
by the natives themselves, who had shot at us, and
killed one of our men, without any just provoca-
tion ; so that as we were in a capacity to ght them,
we might also be in a capacity to do ourselves jus-
tice upon them in an extraordinary manner; that
though the poor man had taken a little liberty nvith
a weneh, he ought not to have been murdered, and
that in such a villanous manner: and that they did
nothing but what was just, and what the laws of God-
allowed to be done to murderers. - "
One would think this-should have been enough to
have warned us against going on shore among hea-
thens and barbarians; but it is impossible to make
mankind wise, but at their own experience, and their
experience seems to be always of most use to them,

We were now bound to the gulf of Persia, and
from thence to the coast of Coromandel, only to
touch at Surratte; but the chief of the supercar-
go’s design lay at the bay of Bengal, where, if he
missed of the business outward bound, he was to
go up to China, and return to the coast as he came
home.
The rst disaster that befell us, was in the gulf of
Persia, where ve of our men venturing on shore, on
the Arabian side of the gulf, were surrounded by
the Arabs, and either all killed, or carried away
into slavery; the rest of the boat’s crew were not
able to rescue them, and had butjust time to get off
their boat. I began to upbraid them with ‘the just
retribution -of Ileaven in this case; but the boat»
swain very warmly told me, he thought I went far-
ther in my ccnsures than I could show any warrant
for in Scripture, and referred to the thirteenth of
Saint Luke, verse fourth, where our Saviour inti-
mates that those men, on whom the tower of Siloani
fell, were not sinners above all the Galileans; but
that which indeed put me to silence in this case,
was, that not one of these ve men, who were new
lost, were of the number of those who went on shore
to the massacre of Madagascar (so I always called
it, though our men could not bear the word ‘ mas-
sacre’ with any patience): and indeed this last cir-
cmnstance, as I have said, put me to si' lice for the
present.
But my frequent preaching to them on this sub-
ject, had worse consequenees than I expected ; and
the boatswain, who had been at the head of the at-
tempt, came up boldly to me one time, and told me
he found that I continually brought that affair upon
the stage; that I made unjust reections upon it,
and had used the men very ill on that account, and
himself in particular; that as I was but a passenger,
and had no command in the ship, or concern in the
voyage, they were not obliged to bear it; that they
did not know but I might have some ill design in
my head, and, perhaps, to call them to an account
for it when they came to England; .and that, there-
fore, unless I would resolve to have done with
it, and also not to concern myself any further with
him, or any of his a'airs, he would leave the ship ;
for he did not think it was safe to sail with me
among them.
I heard him patiently enough till he had done,
and then told him, that I did confess I had all
along opposed the massacre of Madagascar, for such
I would always call it; and that I had, on all occa-
sions, spoken my mind freely about it, though not
more upon him than any of the rest; that as to my
having no command in the ship, that was true, nor
did I exercise any authority, only took the liberty
of speaking my mind in things which publicly con-
cerned us all: as to what concern I had in the voy-
age, that was none of his business; thatI was a con-
siderable owner in the ship, and in that claim I con-
ceived I had aright to speak, even farther than I
had yet done, and would not be accountable to him,
or any one else, and began to be a little warm with
him. He made but little reply to me at that time,
and I thought that affair had been over. We were
at this time in the road at Bengal; and,being willing
to see the place, I went on shore with the super-
cargo, in the ship’s boat, to divert myself, and to-
wards evening was preparing to go on board, when
one of the men came to me, and told me, he would
not have me trouble myself to come down to the
boat, for they had orders not to carry me on board.
Any .one may guess what a surprise I was in at
so iusolent a message; and I asked the man, who
bade him deliver that errand to me. He told me
2 A
, .
the cockswain. I said no more to the fellow,
but bade him let them know he Ihad delivered
his message, and that I had given him no an-
swer to it. -
I immediately went, and found out the super-
cargo, and told him the story, adding what I pre-
sently foresaw, viz. that there would certainly be a
mutiny in the ship, and entreated him to go imme-
diately on board the ship, in an Indian boat, and
acquaint the captain of it. But I might have
spare_d this intelligence, for, before I had spoken to
him on shore, the matter was eifected on board.
The boatswain, the gunner, the carpenter, and, in a
word, all the inferior orlicers, as soon as I was gone
off in the boat, came up to the quarter-deck, and de-
sired to speak with the captain; and there the
boatswain making a long harangue (for the fellow
talked very well), and repeating all he had said to
me, told the captain, in few words, that as I was
now gone peaceably on shore, they were "loath to
use any violence with me, which, if I had not gone
on shore, they would otherwise have done, to
oblige me to have gone. They therefore thought
t to tell him, that as they shipped themselves to
to serve in the ship, under his command, they
would perform it faithfully: but if I would not quit
the ship, or the captain oblige me to quit it, they
would all leave the ship, and sail no farther with
him. And at that word, ‘ all,’ he turned his face
about, towards the mainmast, which was, itseems,
the signal agreed on between them, at which all the
seamen being gotltogether, they cried out, ‘ One and
all! One and all !’ ,
My nephew, the captain, was a man of spirit, and
of great presence of mind ; and though he was sur-
prised, you may be sure, at the thing, yet he told
them calmly, he would consider of the matter, but
that he could do nothing in it till he had spoken to
me about it. He used some arguments with them,
to show them the unreasonableness and injusticeiof
the thing, but it was all in vain; they swore, and
shook hands round, before his face, that they
would go all on shore, unless he would engage
to them, not to suffer me to come any more on
board the ship. T
This was a hard article upon him, who knew his
obligation to me, and did not know how I might
take it; so he began to talk cavalierly to them,
told them that I was a very considerable owner of
the ship, and that in justice he could not put me
out of my own house; that this was next door to
serving me, as the famous pirate Kid had done,
who made the mutiny in a ship, set the captain on
shore in an uninhabited island, and ran away with
the ship ; that let them go into what ship they
could, if ever they came to England again, it would
cost them dear ; that the ship was mine, and that he
could not put me out of it; and thatphe would
rather lose the ship, and the voyage too, than dis-
oblige me so much; so they might do as they pleased.
However, he would go on shore, and talk with me
on shore; and invited the boatswain to go with
him, and, perhaps, they might accommodate the
matter with me. . '
"But they all rejected the proposal, and said they
would have nothing to do with me any more, neither
on board nor on shore; and if I came on board,
they would all go on shore. ‘ Well,’ said the captain,
‘ if you are all of this mind, let me go on shore,
and talk with him.’ So away he came to me with
this account, a little after the message had been
brought to me from the cockswain. _
I was very glad to "see my nephew, I must con-
fess; for I was not without apprehensions, that they
would conne him by violence, set sail, and run
away with the ship ; and then Iliad been stripped
naked in a remote cbuntry, and nothing to help my-
self. In short, I had been ‘in a worse case, than
when I was all alone in the island.
But they had not gone that length, it seems, to
my great satisfaction; and when my nephew told
me what they had said to him, and how they had
sworn, and shook hands, that they would, one and
all, leave the ship, if I was su"ered to come on
board, I told him he should not be concerned at it
at all, for I would stay on shore. I only desired he
would take care and send me all my necessary
things on shore, and leave me a suicient sum of
money, and I would nd my way to England as
well as I could.
This was a heavy piece of news to my nephew;
but there was no way to help it, but to comply
with it. So, in short, he went on board the ship
again, and satised the men that his uncle had
yielded to their importunity, and had sent for his
goods from on board the ship. So the matter was
over in a very few hours: the men returned to their
duty, and I begun to consider what course I should
steer. '
I was now alone in the remotest part of the
world, as I think I may call it; for I was near three
thousand leagues by sea farther oil’ from England,
than I was at my island; only, it is true, I might
travel here by land over the Great M0gul‘s country
to Surratte, might go from thence to Bassora by
sea, up the gulf of Persia, and from thence might
take the way of the caravans, over the deserts of
Arabia, to Aleppo and Scanderoon; from thence
by sea again to Italy, and so over land into
France; and this put together might be, at least, a
full diameter of the globe: but, if it were to ‘be
measured, I suppose, it would appear to be a great
deal more.
I had another way before me, which was to wait
for some English ships, which were coming to Ben-
gal, from Achin, on the island of Sumatra, and get
passage on board them for England. But as I came
hither without_any concern with the English East
India Company, so it would be diicult to go from
hence without their licence, unless with great favour
of the captains of the ships, or of the Company’s
factors; and to both I was an utter stranger.
Here I had the particular pleasure, speaking by
contraries, to see the ship set sail without me; a
treatment, I think, a man in my circumstances scarce
ever met with, eizcept from pirates running away
with a ship, and setting those that would not agree
with their villany on shore. Indeed, this was
next door to it, both ways. However, my nephew
left me two servants, or rather one companion, and
one servant; the rst was clerk to the purser,
whom he engaged to go with mo, and the other was
his own servant. I tookime also a good lodging in
the house of an English woman, where several mer-
chants lodged, some French, two Italians, or rather
Jews, and one Englishman. Here I was hand-
somely enough entertained, and, that I might not be
said to run rashly upon any thing, I staid hero
above nine months, considering what course to
take, and how to manage myself. I had some Eng.
lish goods with me of value, and a considerable sum
of money, my nephew furnishing me with a thou-
sand pieces of eight, and a letter of credit for more,
if I had occasion, that I might not be straitened,
whatever might happen. p
I_quickly disposed of my goods, and to advan-
tage too; and, as I originally intended, I bought
here some very good diamonds, which, of all other
things, was the most properfor me in my circum.
stances, because I might always carry my whole
estate about me.
After a long stay here, and many proposals made
for my return to England, but none falling out to my
mind, the English merchant, who lodged with me,
and with whom I had contracted an intimate ac-
quaintance, came to me one morning‘: ‘ Country.
man,’ said he, ‘ I have a project to communicate to
you,iwhich, as it suits with my thoughts, may, for
aught I know, suit with yoursalso, when you shall
have thoroughly considered it. ‘
‘ Here we are posted,’ says he, ‘ you by accident,
and I by my own choice, in a part of the world very
remote from our own country; but it is in a coun-
try, where, by us who understand trade and busi-
ness, a great deal of money is to be got. If you-
will put a thousand pounds to my thousand pounds,
we will hire a ship here, the rst we can get to our
minds; you shall be captain, I will be merchant,
and we will go actrading voyage to China; for what
should we stand still for? The whole world is in
motion, rolling rouigd and round: all the creatures
of God, heavenly bodies and earthly, are busy and
diligent. Why should we be idle? There are
no drones,’ said he,» ‘ living in the world but men.
Why should we be of that number?’
I liked this proposal very well, and the more, be-
cause it seemed to be expressed with so much
good will, and in so friendly a manner. I will not
say but that I might, by my loose and unhinged
circumstances, he the litter to embrace a proposal
for trade, and, indeed, for any thing else; or, other-
wise, trade was none of my elem.ent. I-Iowever,
I might, perhaps, say with some truth, that if
trade was not my element, rambling was; and.
no proposal for seeing any part of the world which
I had never seen before, could possibly come amiss
to me. I '
It was, however, some time before we could get a
ship to our mind, and when we had got a vessel,’ it
was not easy to get English sailors ; "that is to say,
so many as were necessary to govern the voyage,
and manage the sailors which we should pick up
there. After some time we got a mate, a boatswain,
and a gunner, English; a Dutch carpenter, and
three Portuguese foremast-men; with these we
found we could do well enough, having Indian
seamen, such as they are, to make up. ~
There are so many travellers who have written
the history of their voyages and travels this way,
that it would be but very little diversion to any
body, to give a long account of the places we went
to, and the people who inhabit there. Those things
I leave to others, and refer the reader to those jour-
nals and travels of‘ Englishmen, many of which I
nd are published, and more promised every day.
It is enough for me to tell you, that we made the
voyage to Achin, in the island of Sumatra, rst; and
from thence to Siam, where we exchanged some of
our wares for opium, and for some arrack; the rst,
a commodity which bears a great price among the
Chinese, and which, at that time, was very much
wanted there. In a word, we went up to Susham,
made a very great voyage, were eight months out,
and returned to Bengal ; and I was very well satis-
ed with my adventure. 1 obsewe that our peo-
ple in England often admire how the oicers,
which the‘Company send into India, and the mer-
chants which gcnerally stay there, get such very
great estates as they do, and sometimes come home
worth from sixty to seventy, and one hundred thou-
gand pounds at a time.
But it is no wonder; or, at least, we shall see so
much farther into it, when we consider the innu-
merable ports and places where they have a free
commerce,_ that it will then be no wonder; and
much less will it be so, when we consider that at
all those places and ports, "where the English ships
como, there is so much, and such constant demand
for the growth of all other countries, that there is a
certain vent for the returns, as well as a market
abroad for the goods carried out.
. In short, we made a very good voyage, and I got
so much money by the rst adventure, and such
an insight into the method of getting more, that,
had, I been twenty years younger, I should have
been tempted to have staid here, and sought no
farther for making my fortune. But what was all
thisto a man on the wrong side of threescore, that
was rich enough, and came abroad more in obe-
dience to a restless desire of seeing the world, than
a -covetous desire of getting in it; and indeed, I
think, it is with great justice that I now call it a
restless desire; for it was so : when I was at home,
I was restless to go abroad, and new I was abroad,
I was restless to be at home. I say, what was this
gain to me? I was rich enough already; nor had
I any uneasy desires about getting more money;
and, therefore, the prots of the voyage to me,
were things of no great force for the prompt-
ing me forward to farther undertakings; and I
thought, that, by this voyage, I had made no pro-
gress at all, because I was come back, as I might
call it, to the place from whence I came, as to a
home; whereas, my eye, which, like that which
Solomon speaks of, was never satised with seeing,
was still more desirous of wandering and seeing. I
was come into a part of the world which I never
was in before; and that part in particular which I
had heard much of, and was resolved to see as
much of as I could; and then I thought I might
say I had seen all the world that was worth seeing.
But my fellow-traveller and I had different no-
tions. 1 do not name this, to insist upon my own,
for I acknowledge his was the most just, and the
most suited to the end of a merchant’s life, who,
when he is abroad upon_ adventures, it is his wis-
dom to stick to that, as the best thing for him,
which he is like to get the most money by. My
new friend kept himself to the nature of the thing,
and would have been content to have gone, like
a carrier’s horse, always to the same inn, back~
ward and forward, provided he could, as_he call-
ed -it, nd his account in it; on the other hand,
mine, as old as I was, was the notion of a mad,
rambling boy, that never cares to see a thing twice
over. . -
But this was not all : I had a kind of impatience
upon me to be nearer home, and yet the most un~
settled resolution imaginable, which way to go. In
the interval of these consultations, my friend, who
was always upon the search for business, proposed
another voyage to me, viz. among the Spice Islands,
and t0.bring home a load of cloves, from the Manil-
las, or thereabouts; places where, indeed, the Dutch
do trade, but the islands partly belong to the Spa
niards ; though we went not so far, but to some
other, where they have not the whole power as
they have at Batavia, Ceylon, &c. We were not
long in preparing for this voyage; the chicl’ dith-
culty was, in bringing me to come into it. How-
ever, at last, nothing else offering, and nding that
really stirring about, and trading, the prot being
so great, and I may say certain, had more pleasure
in it, and more satisfaction to the mind, than sitting
still, which, to, me especially, was the unhappiest
part of life, I resolved on this voyage too, which we,
made very successfully, touching at Borneo, and se-
veral islands, whose names 1 do not remember, and
came home in about ve months. We sold our spice
which was chiey cloves, and some nutmegs, to the
Persian merchants, who carried them away for the
gulf, and, making near ve of one, we really got a
great deal of money.
My friend, when we made up this account,
smiled at me : ‘ Well, now,’ said he, with a sort of
an agreeable insult upon my indolent temper, ‘ is
not this better than walking about here, like a man
of nothing to (lo, and spending our time in staring at
the nonsense and ignorance of the Pagans?’ ‘ Why,
truly,’ said I, ‘ friend, I think it is; and I begin to
be a convert to the principles of merchandising;
but I must tell you,’ said I, ‘ by the way, you do
not know what I am doing, for if once I conquer my
backwardness, and embark heartily, as old as I am, I
shall harass you up and down the world, till 1 tire
you ; for I shall pursue it so eagerly, I shall never
let you lie still.’ ’
But, to be short with my speculations, a littl
while after this, there came in a Dutch ship from
Batavia; she was a coaster, not an European trader,
2 A 2
\
and of about two hundred tons burden. The men,
as they pretended, having been so sickly, that the
captain had not men enough to go to sea with, he lay
by at Bengal; and, as if having got money enough,
or being willing, for other reasons, to go for Europe,
he gave public notice, that he would sell his ship.
This came to my ears before my new partner heard
of it, and I hada great mind to buy it. So I went
home to him, and told him of it. He considered a
while; for he was no rash man neither, but, musing
some time, he replied, ‘ She is a little too big: but,
however, we will have her.’ Accordingly we bought
the ship, and, agreeing with the master, we paid for
her, and took possession. When we had done so,
we resolved to entertain the men, if we could, to
join with those we had, for the pursuing our busi-
ness; but, on a sudden, they having received not
their wages, but their share of the money, as we
afterwards learned, not one of them was to be
found. We inquired much about them, and, at
length, were told that they were all gone together,
by land, to Agra, the great city of the Mogul’s resi-
dence, and from thence were to travel to Suratte,
and so by sea to the gulf of Persia.
Nothing had so heartily troubled me a good
while, as that I missed the opportunity of going
with them; for such a ramble, I th0nght,and in such
company as would both have guarded me and di-
verted me, would have suited mightily with my
great design; and I should both have seen the
world, and gone homewards too. But I was much
better satised a few days after, when I came to
know what sort of fellows they were ; for, in short,
their history was, that this man they called captain,
was the gunner only, not the commander; that
they had been a trading voyage, in which they
were attacked on shore by some of the Malac-
cans, who had killed thecaptain, and three of his
men, and that‘ after the captain was killed, these
men, eleven innuinber, had resolved to run away
with the ship, which they did, and had brought
her in at the bay of Bengal, leaving the mate and
ve men more on shore; of whom" we shall hear
farther.
Well, let them come by the ship how they would,
we came honestly by her, as we thought, though we
did not, I confess, examine into things so exactly as
we ought, for we never inquired any thing of the
seamen, who, if we had examined, would certainly
have faltcred in their accounts, contradicted one
another, and, perhaps, contradicted themselves, or,
one how or other, we should have seen reason to
have suspected them; but the man showed us a
bill of sale for the ship, to one Emanuel Clo-
stershoven, or some such name (for, I suppose,
it was all a forgery)» and‘ called himself by that
name, and we could not contradict him; and being
withal a little too unwary, or, at. least, having no
suspicion of the thing, we went‘ through with our
bargain.
However, we picked up some English seamen‘
here after this, and some Dutch,rand we now re-
solved for a second voyage to the south-east, for
cloves, &c.;' that is to say,. among the Philippine
and Malacca isles: and, in short, not to ll this
part of my story with tries, when what is yet
to come is so remarkable, I spent, from rst to
last, six years in this country, trading from port
to port, backward and forward, and with very
good success, and was now the last year, with my
partner, going in the ship above-mentioned, on a
voyage to China, but designing rst to Siam, to
buy rice. _ ~
In this voyage, being, by contrary winds, obliged
to beat up and down a great while, in the straits of
Malacca, and among the islands, we were no sooner
got clear of those difficult seas, but we found our
ship had sprung a leak, and we were not able, by all
our industry, to nd out where it was. This forced
us to make for some port, and my partner, who
knew the country better than I did, directed the
captain to put into the river of Cambodia; for I
had made the English mate, one Mr. ’I_l‘homson,
captain, not being willing to take the charge of
the ship upon myself. This river lies on the north
side of the great bay, or gulf, which goes up to
Siam.
While we were here, and going often on shore for
refreshment, there comes to me one day an English-
man, and he was, it seems, a gunner’s mate on
hoard an English East India ship, whicl1"rode in
the same river, up at, or near, the city of Cambodia:
what brought him hither we knew not; but he
comes up tome, and speaking in English, ‘ Sir,’ said
he, ‘ you are a stranger to me, and I to you; but
I have something to tell you, that very nearly
concerns you.’
I looked steadily at him a good while, and
thought at rst I had known him, but I did not.
‘If it very nearly concerns me,’ said I, ‘ and not
yourself, what moves you to tell it me?‘ ‘ I am
moved,’ said he, ‘ by the imminent danger you are
in; and, for aught I see, you have no knowledge of
it.’ ‘ I know no danger I am in,’ said I, ‘ but that
my ship is leaky, and I cannot nd it out; but I
purpose to lay her aground to-morrow, to see if I
can nd it.’ ‘ But, sir,’ said he, ‘leaky or not
leaky, nd it or not nd it, you will be wiser" than
to lay your ship on shore to-morrow, when you hear
what 1 have to say to you. Do you know, sir,’ said
he, ‘ the -town of Cambodia lies about fteen
leagues up this river, and there are two large English
ships about ve leagues on this side, and three
Dutch ?’ ‘ Well,’ said I, ‘ and what is that to me?’
‘ Why, sir,’"says he, ‘is it for a man that is H1301}
such adventures as you are, to come into a port, and
not examine rst what ships there are there, and
Whether he is able to dealwith them? I suppose,
you do not think you are a match for them.’ Y I
was amused very much at his discourse, but not
amaied at it, for I could not conceive what he
meant; and I turned short upon him, and said,
‘ Sir, I wish you would explain yourself; I cannot
imagine what reason I have to be afraid of any of
the Company’s ships, or Dutch ships: I am no in-
terlopcr. What can they have to say to me 2’
I-Ie looked like a man half angry, half pleased;
and, pausing a while, but smiling, ‘ Well, sir,’ said
he, ‘if you think yourself secure, you must take
your chance. I am sorrry your fate should blind
you against good advice; but assure yourself, if you
do not put to sea immediately, you will, the very
next tide, be attacked by ve long boats full of
men; and perhaps, if you are taken, you will be
hanged for appirate, and the particulars be examined
into afterwards. I thought, sir,’ added he, ‘ I
should have met with a better reception than this,
for doing you a piece of service of such import-
ance.’ ‘ I can never be ungrateful,’ said I, ‘ for
any service, or to any man that offers me any kind-
ness ; but it is past my comprehension,’ said I, ‘ what
they should have such a design upon me for. How-
ever, since you say there is no time to be lost, and
that there is some villanous design in hand against
me, I’ll go on board this minute, and put to sea
immediately, if my men can stop the leak, or if we
can swim without stopping it. But, sir,’ said I,
‘ shall I go away ignorant of the reason of all this?
Can you give me no farther light into it?’ _
‘ I can tell you but part of the story, sir,’ says he;
‘ but I have a Dutch seaman here with me, and I
believe I could persuade him to tell you the rest,
but there is scarce time for it. But the short of the
story is this, the rst part of which I suppose you
know well enough, viz. that you were with this
ship at Sumatra; that there your captain was mur-
dered by the Malaccans, with three of his men; and
that you, or some of those that were on board with
you, ran away with the ship, and are since turned
pirates. This is the sum of the story; and you will
n
be all seized as pirates, I can assure you, and exo-
cuted with very little ceremony; for you know
merchant ships show but little law to pirates, if
they get them in their power.’
‘ Now you speak plain English,’ said I, ‘ and I
thank you; and though I know nothing that we
have done like what you talk of, but I am sure we
came honestly and fairly by the ship, yet, seeing
such work is a doing, as you say, and that you seem
to mean honestly, I’ll be upon my guard.’ ‘ Nay, sir,’
says he, ‘ do not talk of being upon your guard; the
best defence is to be out of the danger; if you have
any regard for your life, and the lives of all your
men, put out to sea without fail, at high-water; and
as you have a whole tide before you,~'you will be
gone too far out before they can come down; for
they will ‘come away at high-water; and as they
have twenty miles to come, you get near two hours
of them by the difference of the tide, not reckoning
the length of the way: besides, as they are only
boats, and not ships, they will not venture to follow
you far out to sea, especially if it blows.’
‘ Well,’ said I, ‘ you have been very kind in this.
What shall I do for you, to make you amends?’ ‘Sir,’
says he, ‘you may not be so willing to make me
amends, because you may not be convinced of the
truth of it. I’ll make an offer to you: I have nine.
teen months’ pay due to me on board the ship .......
which I came out of England in; and the Dutch-
man that is with me has seven months’ pay due to
him; if you will make good our pay to us, we will
go along with you; if you nd nothing -more in it,
we will desire no more; but if we do convince you
that we have saved your life, and the ship, and the
lives of all the men in her, we will leave the rest to
you)
I consented to this readily, and went immediately
on board, and the two men with me. As soon as I
came to the ship side, my partner, who was on board,
came out on the quarter-deck, and called to me
with a great deal of joy, ‘ O ho! O ho! we have
stopp’d the leak! we have stopp’d the leak!’ ‘Say
you so,’ said I; ‘thank God; but weigh the an-
chor immediately.’ ‘ Weigh!’ says he, ‘ what do
you mean by that? What is the matter?‘ says he.
‘ Ask no questions,’ said I, ‘ but all hands to work,
and weigh without losing a minute.’ I-Ie was sur-
prised ; but, however, he called the captain, and he
immediately ordered the anchor to be got up ; and
though the tide was not quite done, yet a little
land-breeze blowing, we stood out to sea. Then I
called him into the cabin, and told him the story in
general; and we called in the men, and they told us
the rest ofit; but as it took us up a great ideal of
time, so before we had done, a seaman comes to the
cabin door, and calls out to us, that the captain
bade him tell us we were chased. ‘ Chased,’ said
I, ‘ by whom, and by what?’ ‘ By ve sloops, or
boats,’ said the fellow, ‘ full of men.’ ‘ Very well,’
said I, ‘ then it is apparent the-re is something in it. ’
In the nextplace, I ordered all our men to be called
up, and told them that there was a design to seize
the ship, and to take us for pirates, and asked them
if they would stand by us, and by one another.
The men answered cheerfully that, one and all, they
would live and die with us. Then I asked the cap-
tain, what wayhe thought best for us to manage a
ght with_them; for resist them I resolved we would,
and that to the last drop. He said readily, that the
way was to keep them o" with our great shot, as
long as we could, and then to re at them with our
small arms, to keep them from boarding us; but
when neither of these would do any longer, we
should retire to our close quarters: perhaps they
had not materials to break open our bulk-heads, or
get in upon us.
The gunner had, in the mean time,orders to bring
two guns to bear fore and aft, outof the steerage, to
clear the deck, and load them with musket-bullets
and small pieces of old iron, and what next came to
hand; and thus we made ready for ght, but all
this while kept out to sea, with wind enough, and
could see the boats at a distance, being ve large
long-boats, following us with all the sail they could
make.
Two of those boats, which by our glasses we could
see were English, had outsailed the rest, were near
two leagues ahead of them, and gained upon us
considerably, so that we found they would come
up with us; upon which we red a gun without a
shot, to intimate that they should bring to, and we
put out a ag of truce as a signal for parley ; but
they kept crowding after us till they came within
shot. Upon this we took in our whiter ag, they
having made no answer to it, hung out the red ag,
and red at them with shot. Notwithstanding this,
they came on till they were near enough to call to
them with a speaking-trumpet which we had on
board; so we called to them, and bade them keep
off at their peril.
It was all one, they crowded after us, and en-
deavoured to come under our stern, so to board us
on our quarter: upon which, seeing they were re-
solute for mischief, and depended upon the strength
that followed them, I ordered to bring the ship to,
so that they lay upon our broadside, when imme-
diately we red ve guns at them, one of which had
been levelled so true as to carry away the stern of
the hindermost boat, and bring them to the neces-
sity of taking down their sail, and running all to
the head of the boat, to keep her from sinking; so
she lay by, and had enough of it; but, seeing the
foremost boat crowd still on after us, we made ready
to re at her in particular. ‘
While this was doing, one of the three boats that
were behind, being forwarder than the other two,
made up to the boat which we had disabled, to re-
lieve her, and we could afterwards see her take out
her men. We called again to the foremost boat, and
offered a truce to parley again, and to know what
was her business with us; but had no answer;
only she crowded close under our stern. Upon
this our gunner, who was a very dexterous fellow,
run out his two chase-guns, and red at her; but
the shot missing, the men in the boat shouted,
waved their caps, and came on; but the gunner
getting quickly ready again, red among them the
second time, one shot of which, though it missed
the boat itself, yet it fell in among the men, and, we
could easily see, had done a great deal of mischief
among them: but we, taking no notice of that,
weared the ship again, and brought our quarter to
bear upon them, and, ring three guns more, we
found the boat was split almost to pieces, in parti-
cular her rudder and a piece of her stern were shot
quite away ; so they handed their sail immediately,
and were in great disorder. But, to complete their
misfortune, our gunner let y two guns at them
again: where he hit them we could not tell; but
we found the boat was sinking, and some of the
men ‘already in the water. Upon this 1 immedi-
ately manned out our pinnace, which we had kept
close by our side, with orders to pick up some of
the men, if they could, and save them from drown-
ing, and immediately to come on board with them,
because we saw the rest of the boats began to come
up. Our men in the pinnace followed their orders,
and took up three men, one of which was just
drowning, and it was a good while before we could
recover him. As soon as they were on board, we
crowded all the sail we could make, and stood far-
ther out to sea; and we found that when the other
three boats came up to the rst two, they gave over
their chase. '
Being thus delivered from a danger which,though
I knew not the reason of it, yet seemed to he much
greater than I had apprehended, I took care that we
would change our course, and not let any one
imagine whither we were going; so we stood out to
sea eastward, quite out of the course of all Euro-
pean ships, whether they were_bound to China, or
any where else within the commerce of the Euro-
pean uations. -
When we were now at sea, we began to consult
with the two seamen, and inquire rst, what the
meaning of all this should be. The Dutchman let
us into the secret of it at once, telling us, that the
fellow that sold us the ship, as we said, was no more
than a thief, that had ran away with her. Then he
told us how the captain, whose name too he men-
tioned, though I do not remember it now, was
treacherously murdered by the natives on“the coast
of 'Ma1acca, with three of his men ; and that he,
this Dutchman, and four more, got into the woods,
where they wandered _about a great while, till at
length he, in particular, in a miraculous manner,
made his escape, and swam oil‘ to a Dutch ship,
which sailing near the shore, in its way from China,
had sent their boat on shore for fresh water; that he
durst not come to that part of the shore where the
boat was, but made shift, in the night, to take into
the water farther oil, and, swimming a great while,
at last the ship’s boat took him up.
I-Ie then told us, that he went to Batavia, where
two of the seamenibelonging to the ship had arrived,
having deserted the rest in their travels; and gave
an account, that the fellow who had ran away with
the ship, sold her, at Bengal, to a set of pirates,
who were gone a cruising in her; and that they
had already taken an English ship, and two Dutch
ships, very richly laden.
This latter part we found to concern us directly;
and though we knew it to be false, yet, as my part-
ner said, very well, if we had fallen into their hands,
and they had had such a prepossession against us
before-hand, it had been in vain for us to have de-
fended ourselves, or to hope for any good quarter
at their hands; especially considering that our ac-
cusers had been our judges, and that we could have
expected nothing from them but what rage would
have dictated, and ungoverned passion have exe-
cuted: and therefore it was his opinion we should
go directly back to Bengal, from whence we came,
without putting in at any port whatever; because
there we could give an account of ourselves, and
could prove where we were when the ship put in,
whom we bought her of, and the like; and, which
was more than all the rest, if we were put to the
necessity of bringing it before the proper judges, we
should be sure to have some justice, and not be
hanged rst, and judged afterwards.
.I was some time of my partner’s opinion; but
after a little more serious thinking, I told him I
thought it was a very great hazard for us to attempt
returning to Bengal, for that we were on the wrong
side of the straits of Malacca; and that if the alarms
was given,__we should be sure to be way-laid on every
side, as well by the Dutch of Batavia as the English
elsewhere; that if we should be taken, as it were,
running away, we should even condemn ourselves,
and there would want no more evidence to destroy
us. I also asked the English sailor’s opinion, who
said, he was of my mind, and that we should cer-
tainly be taken. i
This danger a little startled my partner and all
the ship’s company; and we immediately resolved
to go away to the coast ofTonquin, and so on to
China; and, from thence pursuing the rst design,
as to trade, nd some way or other to dispose of the
ship, and come back in some of » the vessels of the
country, such as we could get. This was approved
of as the best method for our security , and accord-
ingly we steered away N. N. E. keeping above fty
leagues off from the usual course to the eastward.
This, however, put us to some inconveniences;
for, rst, the winds, when we came to that distance
from the shore, seemed to belmore steadily against
us, blowing almost trade, as we call it, from the
east, and E. N. E. so that we were a long while
upon our voyage; and we were but ill provided
.0
with victuals for so long a run, and, which was still
worse, there was some danger that those English
and Dutch ships whose boats pursued us, whereof
some were bound that way, might be got in before
us, and, if not, some other ship bound to China,
might have information of us from them, and pursue
us with the same vigour.
I must confess, I was now very uneasy, and thought
myself, including the late escape from the ‘long
boats, to have been in the most dangerous condition
that ever I was in through all my past life; for,
whatever ill circumstances I had been in, I was
never pursued for a thief before; nor had I ever
done any thing that merited the name of dishonest,
or fraudulent, much less thievish. I had chiey
been my owln enemy, or, as I may rightly say, I
had been nobody’s enemy but my own. But now I
was embarrassed in the worst condition imaginable,
for though I was perfectly innocent, I was in no
condition to make that innocence appear : and if I
had been taken, it had been under a supposed guilt
of the worst kind; at least, a crime esteemed so
among the people I had to do with.
This made me very anxious to make an escape;
though which way to do it, I knew not, or what
port or place we should go to. My partner seeing
me thus dejected though he was the most concern-
ed at rst, began to encourage me, and describing
to me the several ports of that coast, told me, he
would put in, on the coast of Coehinchina, or the
bay of Tonquin, intending ~to go afterwards to
Macao, a town once in the possession of the Por-
tuguese, and where still a great many European
families resided, and particularly the missionary
priests usually went thither, in order- to their going
forward to China.
Hither then we resolved to go, and accordingly,
though after a tedious and irregular course, and
very much straitened for provisions, we came within
eight of the coast very early in the morning;
and, upon reection upon the circumstances we
were in, and the danger, if we had not escaped, we
resolved to put into a small river, which, however,
had depth enough of water.for us, and to see if we
could, either over land, or by the ship's pinnaee,
come to know what ships were in any port there-
abouts. This happy step was indeed our deliver-
ance, for though we did not immediately see any
European ships in the bay of Tonquin, yet the next
morning there came into the bay two Dutch ships,
and a third without any colours spread out, but
which we believed to be a Dutchman, passed by at
about two leagues’ distance, steering for the coast of
China, and, in the afternoon, went by two English
ships, steering the same course; and thus _we
thought we saw ourselves beset with enemies, both
one way and the other. The place we were in was
Wild and barbarous, the people thieves, cvenby oc-
cupation or profession, and though it is true, we
had not much to seek of them, and, except getting a
few provisions, cared not how little we had to do
with them, yet it was with much diiculty that we
kept ourselves from being insulted by them several
ways. ,_
We were in a small river of this country, within
a few leagues of its utmost limits northward, and
by our boat we coasted north-east to the point of
land which opens the great bay of Tonquin; and it
was in this beating up along the shore, that we dis-
covered, as above, that, in a word, we wore" sur-
rounded with enemies. The people we were among
were the most barbarous of all the inhabitants of
the coast, having no correspondence with any other
nation, and dealing only in sh, and oil, and such
gross commodities; and it may be particularly seen
that they are, as I said, the most barbarous of any
of the inhabitants, viz. that among other customs
they have this as one, that if any vessel have the
misfortune to be shipwrecked upon their coast, they
presently make the men all prisoners, that is to
say, slaves: and it was not long before we found a
spice of their kindness this way, on the occasion fol~
lowing. ~
I have observed above, that our ship sprang a
leak at sea, and that we could not nd it outf
and, however it happened that, as I have said, it
was stopped, unexpectedly, in the happy minute of
our being to be seized, by the Dutch and English
ships, near the bay of Siam; yet as we did not nd
the ship so perfectly tight and sound as we desired,
we resolved, while we were in this place, to lay
her on shore, take out what heavy things we had on
board, which were not many, and to wash and
clean her bottom, and, if possible, to nd out where
the leaks were.
Accordingly, having lightened the ship, and
brought all our guns, and other movable things,
to one side, we tried to bring her clown, that we
might come at her bottom ; for, on second thoughts,
we did not care to lay her dry aground, neither
could we nd out a proper place for it.
The inhabitants, who had never been acquainted
with such a sight, came wondering down to the
shore, to look at us, and seeing the ship lie down on
one side in such a manner, and heeling towards the
shore, and not seeing our men, who were at work
on her bottom, with stages, and with their boats
on the off side. they presently concluded 'that
the ship was cast away, and so lay fast on the
ground. _
On this supposition they came all about us in two
or three hours’ time, with ten or twelve large boats,
having some of them eight, some ten men, in a
boat, intending, no doubt, to have come on board
and plundered the ship, and, if they had found us
there, to have carried us away for slaves to their
king, or whatever they call him, for we knew
nothing who was their governor.
When they came up to the ship, and began to row
round her, they discovered us all hard at work, on
the outside of the ship’s bottom and side, washing,
and graving, and stopping, as every seafaring man
knows how.
They stood for a while gazing at us, and we, who
were a little surprised, could not imagine what
their design was; but, being willing to be sure, we
took this opportunity to get some ‘of us into the
ship, and others to hand down arms and ammuni-
tion to those that were at work, to defend them-
selves with, if there should be occasion; and it was
no more than need, for, in less than aquarter of an
hour’s consultation, they agreed, it seems, that the
ship was really a wreck; that we were all at work,
endeavouring to save her, or to save our lives by
the help of our boats; and when we handed our
arms into the boats, they concluded, by that mo-
tion, that we were endeavouring to save some
of our goods. Upon this, they took it for granted
that all belonged to them; and away they came di-
rectly upon our men, as if it had been in a line of
battle.
Our men, seeing so many of them, began to be
frighted, for we lay but in an ill posture to ght, and
cried out to us to know what they should do. I
immediately called to the men who worked upon the
stage, to slip them down, and get up the side into
the ship, and bade those in the boat to row round,
and come on board, and those few of us who were
on board, worked with all the strength and hands
we had to bring the ship to rights. But, however,
neither the men upon the stage, nor those in the
boats, could do as they were ordered, before the Co-
chinchinesc were upon them, and, with two of their
boats boarded our long boat, and began to lay hold
of the men as their prisoners.
The rst man they laid hold of was an English
seaman, a stout, strong fellow, who, having a mus-
ket in his hand, never offered to re it, but laid it
down in the boat, like a fool, as I thought. But he
understood his business much better than I could
teach him, for he grappled the Pagan, and dragged-
him by main force out of their own boat into ours,
where, taking him by the two ears, he heat his head
so against the boat’s gunnel, that the fellow died in-
stantly in his hands; and, in the mean time, a
Dutchman, whostood next, took up the musket,
and, with the butt-end of it, so laid about him, that
he knocked down ve of them, who attempted to
enter the boat ; but this was little towards resisting
thirty or forty men, who fearless, because ignorant
of their danger, began to throw themselves into the
long boat, where we had but ve men to defend it.
But an accident gave our men a complete victory,
which deserved our laughter rather than any thing
else; and that was this :
Our carpenter being preparing to grave the out~
side of the ship, as well as to pay the seams where
he had caulked her to stop the leaks, had got two
kettles just let down into the boat; one lled with
boiling pitch, and the other with rosin, tallow, and
oil, and such stu as the shipwrights use for that
Work ; and the man that attended the carpenter, had
a great iron ladle in his hand, with which he sup-
plied the men that were at work with that hot stuff :
two of the enemy’s men entered the boat just where
this fellow stood, being in the foresheets ; he imme-
diately saluted them with a ladleful of the stu",
boiling hot, which so burned and scalded them,
being half naked, that they roared out like two
bulls, and, enraged with the re, leaped both into
the sea. The carpenter saw it, and cried out,
‘Well done, Jack, give them some more of it ;’ when
stepping forward himself, he takes one‘ of their
mops, and dipping it in the pitch-pot, he and his
man threw it among them so plentifully, that, in
short, of all the men in three boats, there was not
one that was not scaldcd and burned with it, in a
most frightful,'pitiful manner, and made such a
howling and crying, that I never heard a worse
‘noise, and indeed nothing like it 3 for it is worth
observing, that though pain naturally makes all
people cry out, yet every nation have a particular
way of exclamation, and make noises as di’erent
from another as their speech. I cannot give the
noise these creatures made a better name than
howling, nor a name more proper to the tone of it;
for I never heard any thing morerlike the noise of
the wolves, which, as I have said, I heard howl in
the-forest on the frontiers of Langnedoc,
I was never pleased with a victory better in my
life, not only as it was a perfect surprise to me, and
that our danger was imminent before; but as we
got this victory without any bloodshed, except of
that man the fellow killed with his naked hands,
and which I was very much concerned at, for I was
sick of killing such poor savage wretches, even
though it was in my own defence, knowing they
came on errands which they thought just, and
knew no better; and that though it may be a just
thing, because necessary, for there is no necessary
wickedness in nature, yet I thought it was a sad
life, when we must be always obliged to be killing
our fellow-creatures to preserve ourselves, and, in.
deed I think so still: and I would, even now,
suffer a great deal, rather than 1 would take
away the life even of the worst person injuring
me. I believe also, all considering people, who
know the value of life, would be of my opinion,
if they entered seriously into the consideration
of it. r
But to return to my story: all the while this was
doing, my partner and I, who managed the rest of
the men on board, had, with great dexterity, brought
the ship almost to rights, and having gotten the
guns into their places again, the gunner called to
me, to bid our boats get out of the way, for he
would let y among them. I called back again to
him, and bid him not offer to re, for the carpenter
would do the work without him, but bade him heat
another pitch-kettle, which our cook, who was on
2 B
hoard, took <-are of. But the enemy was so terri-
ed with what they met with in their rst attack,
that they would not come on again; and some of"
th<_-in, that were farlliest ell’, seeing the ship swim,
as it were, upright, began, as we supposed, to see
their mistake, and give over the enterprise, nding
it was not as they expected. Thus we got clear of
this merry ght; and, having gotten some rice, and
some roots, and bread, with about sixteen good,
big hogs on board, two days before, we resolved to
stay here no longer, but go forward, whatever came
of it; for we made no doubt but we should be sur-
rounded the next day with rogues enough, per-
haps more than our pitch-kettle would dispose of
-for us. »
We, therefore, got all our things on board the
same evening, and the next morning were ready to
sail. In the mean time, lying at an anchor some
distance from the shore, we were not so much con-
cerned, being now in a fighting posture, as well as
in a sailing posture, if any enemy had presented.
The next day, having nished our work within
hoard, and nding our ship was perfectly healed of
all her leaks, we set sail. We would have gone into
the hay of Tonquin, for we wanted to inform our-
selves of what was to be known concerning the
Dutch ships that had been there; but we durst
not stand in there, because we had seen several
ships go in, as we supposed, but a little before. So
we kept on N. E. towards the isle of Formosa, as
much afraid of being seen by a Dutch or English
merchant ship, as a Dutch or English merchant
ship in the 1l'led'iterranean is of an Algerine man
of war.
When we were thus got to sea, we kept on N. E.
as if we would go to the Manillas, or the Philip-
pine islands, and this we did that we might not
fall into the way of any of the Iiluropean ships, and
then we steered north again, till we came to the
latitude of twenty-two degrees twenty minutes, by
U:
which means we made the island of Formosa di-
rectly, where we came to an anchor, in order to get
water and fresh provisions, which the people there,
who are very courteous and civil in their manners,
supplied us with willingly, and dealt very fairly-
and punetually with us in all their agreements and
bargains, which is what we did not nd among
other people, and may be owing to the remains of
Christianity, which was once planted here by a
Dutch missionary of protestants, and is 21 testimony
of what I have often observed, viz. that the Chris-
tian religion always eivilizes the people, and reforms
their manners, where it is received, whether it
works saving eliects upon them or no.
4 From hence we sailed still north, keeping the
coast of China at an equal distance, till we knew
we were beyond all the port-s of China where our
European ships usually come, being resolved, if
possible, not to fall into any of their hands, espe-
cially in this country, where, as our circumstances
were, wo could not fail of being entirely ruined ;
nay, so great was my fear in particular, as to my
being taken by them, that I believe rmly, I would
much rather have chosen to fall into the hands of
the Spanish Inquisition.
Being now come to the latitude of thirty degrees,
we resolved to put into the first trading port we
should come at, and, stamding in for the shore, a
boat came off two leagues to us, with an old Por-
tuguese pilot on board, who, knowing; us to be
an European ship, came to offer his service, which,
indeed, we were very glad of, and took him on
board ; upon which, without asking us whither we
would go, he dismissed the boat he came in, and
sent it back. .
I thought it was now so much in our choice to
make the old man carry us whither we would, that
I began to talk with him about carrying us to the
gulf of Nanquin, which is the most northern part
or‘ the coast of China. The old mun said he knew
the gulf of Nanquin very well, but, smiling, asked
us what we would do there.
I told him we would sell our cargo, and pur-
chase China wares, calicocs, raw silks, tea, wrought
silks, &:c. and so would return by the same course
we came. He told us our best port had' been to
have put in at Macao, where we could not fail of
a market for our opium to our satisfaction, and
might, for our money, have purchased all sorts of
China goods, as cheap as we could at Nanquin.
Not being able to put the old man out of his talk,
of which he was very opinionated, or conceited, I
told him we were gentlemen, as well as merchants,
and that we had a mind to go and see the great
city of Pekin, and the famous court of the monarch
of China. ‘Why"then,’ says the old man, ‘you
should go to Ningpo, where, by the river which
runs into the sea there, you may go up within ve
leagues of the great canal. This canal is a navi-
gable made stream, which goes through the heart
of all that vast empire of China, crosses all the
rivers, passes some considerable hills by the help
of sluices and gates, and goes up to the city of
Pekin, being in length near two hundred and
seventy leagues.
‘ Well,’ said I, ‘ seignior Portuguese, but that is
not our business now: the great question is, if you
can carry us up to the city of Nanquin, from
whence we can travel to Pekin afterwards. Yes,
he said, he could do so very well, and there was a
great Dutch ship gone up that way just before.
This gave me a little shock : a Dutch ship was now
our terror, and we had much rather have met the
devil, at least, if he had not come in too frightful
a gure. We depended upon it, that a Dutch ship
would be our destruction, for we were in no condi-
tion to ght them; all the ships they trade with in
those parts being of great burden, and of much
greater force than we were.
The old man found me a little confused, and
1
under some concern, when he named a Dutch ship;
and said to me, ‘ Sir, you need be under no appre-
hension of the Dutch, I suppose they are not now
at war with your nation.’ ‘No,’ said I, ‘ that's
true; but I know not what liberties men may take,
when they are out of the reach of the laws of their
own country.’ ‘ Why,’ said he, ‘ you are no pirates,
what need you fear? They will not meddle with
peaceable merchants sure.’
If I had any blood in my body that did not y
up into my face at that word, it was hindered by
some stop in the vessels appointed by nature to cir-
culate it; for it put me into the greatest disorder
and confusion iinaginable; nor was it possible For
me to conceal it so, but that the old man easily
perceived it.
‘ Sir,’ said he,‘ I {ind you are in some disorder
in your thoughts, at my talk; pray be pleased to
go which way yon think t, and, depend upon it,
I’ll do you all the service I can.’ r ‘ Why, scignior,’
said I, ‘ it is true, I am la little unsettled in my re-
solution at this time, whither to go in particular, and
I am something more so, for what you said about
pirates. I hope there are no pirates in these seas:
we are but in an ill condition to meet with them,
for you see we have but a small force, and but very
weakly manned.’ \ ~
' O sir,’ said he, ‘ do not be concerned ; I do not
know that there have been any pirates in these st-as
these fifteen years, except one, which was seen, as
Ihcar, in the bay of Siam, about a month since;
butyou may be assured she is gone to the south-
ward: nor was she a ship oi’ any great force, or lit
for the work; shewas not built for a privatcor, lint
was run away with by a reprobatc crew that xiere
on board, after the captain and seine of his nirn had
been murdered by the Ma-lac-cans, at, or near, the
island of Sumatra.’
‘ What!’ said I. seeming to know nothing of the
matter, ‘ did they murder the captain?’ ‘ No,’

said he, ‘ I do not understa-nd that they murdered
him; but, as they afterwards ran away with the
ship, it is generally believed that they betrayed him
into the hands of the Malaccans, who did murder
him, and, perhaps, they procured them to do it.’
‘ Why, then,’ said I, ‘ they deserve death as much
as if they had done it themselves.’ " Nay,’ said the
old man, ‘ they do deserve it; and they will cer-
tainly have it, if they light upon any English or
Dutch ship ; for they have all agreed together, that,
if they meet that rogue, they will give him no
quarter.’ .
‘But,’ said I to him, ‘ you say the pirate is gone
out of these seas: how can they meet with him
then?’ ‘ Why that’s true,’ said he, ‘ they do say
so; but he was, as I tell you, in the bay of Siam,
in the river Cambodia, and was discovered there by
seine Dutchmen who belonged to the ship, and
who were left on shore when they run away with
her; and some English and Dutch traders being in
the river, they were within a little of taking him.
Nay,’ said he, ‘ if the foremost boats had been well
seconded by the rest, they had certainly taken
him; but he, nding only two boats within reach of
him, tacked about, and red at these two, and dis-
abled them, before the others eame up; and then
standing 'off to sea,-the others were not able to
follow him, and so he got away. But they have
all so exact a description of the ship, that they will
be sure to know him, and wherever they nd him,
they have vowed to give no quarter to either the
captain or the seamen, but to hang them all up at
the yard-arm.’ _
‘ What!’ said I, ‘ will they execute them right
or wrong; hang them rst, and judge them after-
wards Z’ ‘ O, sir,’ said the old pilot, ‘ there is no
need to make a formal business of it with such
rogues as those: let them tie them back to back,
and set them a diving; it is no more than they
rightly deserve.’

I knew I had my old man fast aboard, and that
he could do me no harm, so that'I turned short
upon him. ‘ Well, now, seignior,’ said 1', ‘ and this
is the very reason why I would have you carry us
to Nanquin, and not to put back to Macao, or to
any other part of the country where, the English or
Dutch ships come; for, be it known to you, sei-
gnior, those captains of English and Dutch ships
are a parcel of rash, proud, insole-nt fellows, that
neither know what belongs to justice, nor how to
behave themselves as the laws of God or nature
direct; but being proud of their offices, and not
understanding their power, they would act the mur-
derers to punish robbers, would take upon them to
insult men falsely accused, and determine them
guilty without due inquiry: and, perhaps, I may
live to call some of them to an account for it,
where they may be taught how justice is to be
executed, and that no man ought to be treated as a,
criminal till some evidence may be had of the
crime, and that he is the man.’
With this I told him, that this was the very ship
they had attacked, and gave him a full account of
the skirmish we had with their boats, and how
foolishly and coward-like they behaved. I told
him all the story of our buying the ship, and how
the Dutclnnen served us. 1 told him the reasons I
had to believe that this story of killing the master
by the Malaccans was not true, as also the running
away with the ship ; but that it was all a ction or
their own, to suggest that the men were turned
pirates, and they ought to have been sure it was
so, before they had ventured to attack us by sur-
prise, and oblige us to resist them; adding, that they
would have the blood of those men, who were
killed there in our just defence, to answer for.
The old man was amazed at this relation, and
told us we were very much in the right to go away
to the north, arid that, if he might advise us, it
should be to sell the ship in China, which we might
~
very well do, and buy or‘ build another in the coun-
try. 'And,’ said he, ‘though you will__not get so
good a ship, yet you may get one able enough to
carry you and allgyour goods back again to Bengal,
or any where else.’ -
I told him, I would take his advice, when I came
to any port where I could nd a. ship for my turn,
or get any customer to buy this. He replied. I
should meet with customers enough for the ship
at Nanquin, and that a Chinese junk would serve
me very well to go back again; and that he would
procure me people both tobuy the ouc, and sell
the other.
‘Well, but, seignior,’ says I, ‘ as you say they
know the ship so well, I may, perhaps, if I follow
your measures, he instrumental to bring some ho-
nest, innocent men into a terrible broil, and, per-
haps, occasion their being murdered in cold blood;
for wherever they nd the ship, they will prove
the guilt upon the men, by proving this was the
ship, and so innocent men may probably be over-
powered and murdered.’ ‘ Why,’ said the old man,
‘ l’ll__nd out a way to prevent that also; for as I
know all those commanders you speak of very
well, and shall see them all as they pass by, I will
he sure to set them to rights in the thing, and let
them know that they had been so much in the
wrong, that though the people who were on board
at rst, might run away with the ship, yet it was
not true that they had turned pirates; and that, in
particular, those were not the men that rst went
off with the ship, but innocently bought her for
their trade: and I am persuaded they will so far
believe me, as, at least, to act more cautiously for
the time to come.’ ‘ Well,’ said 1, ‘ and will you
deliver one message to them from me?’ ‘ Yes, I
will,’ says he, ‘ it‘ you will give it under your hand,
in writing, thatl may be able to prove it came from
you, and not out of my own head.’ I answered
that I would readily give it him under my hand.
4
So I took a pen and ink and paper, and wrote at
large the story of assaulting me with the long
boats, &c. the pretended reason of it, and the un-
just, cruel design of it, and concluded to the com-
manders that they had done what they_ not only
should have been ashamed of, but also, that if ever
they came to England, and I lived to see them
there, they should all pay dearly for it, if the laws
of my country were not grown out of use before I
arrived there.
My old pilot read this over and again, and
asked me several times, ifl would stand to it. I
answered, I would stand to it as long as I had any
thing left in the world, being sensible that I should,
one time or other, nd an opportunity to put it
home to them. But we had no occasion ever to
let the pilot carry this letter; for he never went
back again. While those things were passing be-
tween us, by way of discourse, we went forward di-
reetly for Nanquin, and, in about thirteen days’
sail, we came to an anchor at the south-wrist point
of the great gulf of Nanquin, where, by the way,
I came, by accident, to understand that the two
Dutch ships were gone that length before me. and
that I should certainly fall into their hands. I
consulted my partner‘ again in this exigency, and he
was as much at a loss as 1' was, and would very
gladly have been safe on shore almost any where.
I~Ioweve.r, I was not in such perplexity neither, but
I asked the old pilot if there was no creek, or har-
bour, which I might put into, and pursue my busi-
ness with the Chinese privately, and be in no dan-
ger of the enemy. He told me if 1 wetnld sail to
the southward, about two-and-forty leagues, there
was a little port, called Quinehang, where the fa-
thers of the mission usually landed from Macao, on
their progress to teach the Christian religion to the
Chinese, andwhere no European ships ever put in;
and if I thought to put in there, I might consider
wliat farther course to take when l was on shore.
Q B 2
He confessed, he said, it was not a place for mer-
chants, except that, at some certain times, they had
a kind of a fair there, when the merchants from Ja-
pan came over thither to buy the Chinese mer-
chandises.
We all agreed to go back to this place: the
name of the port, as he called it, I may, perhaps,
spell wrong; for I do not particularly remember it,
having lost this, together with the names of many
other places set down in a little pocket-book, which
was spoiled by the water, on an accident which I
shall relate in its order; but this I remember, that
the Chinese or Japanese merchants we correspond-
ed with, called it by a different name from that
which our Portuguese pilot gave it, and pronounced
it as above, Quinchang.
As we were unanimous in our resolutions to go to
this place, we weighed the next day, having only
gone twice on shore, where we were to get fresh
water: on both which occasions the people of the
country were very civil to us, and brought us abund-
ance of things to sell to us, I mean of provisions,
plants, roots, tea, rice, and some fowls; but nothing
without money.
We came to the other port (the wind being con-
trary) not till ve days, but it was very much to
our satisfaction ; and I was joyful, and, I may say,
thankful, when I set my foot safe on shore, resolv-
ing, and my partner too, that, if it was possible, to
dispose of ourselves and effects any other way,
though not every way to our satisfaction, we would
never set foot on board that unhappy vessel more ;
and indee¢.">>I must acknowledge, that, of all the cir-
eumstancesof life, that ever I had any experience
of, nothing rmakes mankind so completely miser-
able as that of being in constant fear. Well does
the Scripture say, ‘The fear of man brings a snare :’
it is a life of death; and the mind is so entirely
oppressed by it, that it is capable of no relief; the
animal spirits sink, and all the vigour of nature,
whichusually support men under other afictious,
and is present to them in the greatest exigencies,
fails them there. _
Nor did it fail ofits usual operations upon the
fancy, by heightening every danger, representing
the English and Dutch captains to be men uncapa-
ble of hearing reason, or distinguishing between ho-
nest men and rogues, or between a story calculated
for our own turn, made out of nothing, on purpose
to deceive, and a true, genuine account of our
whole voyage, progress, and design ; for we might.
many ways have convinced any reasonable creature,
that we were not pirates; the goods wehad on
board, the course we steered, our frankly showing
ourselves, and entering into such and such ports;
even ou-r very manner, the force we had, the 1'ium'cer-
of men, the few arms, little ammunition, short pro-
visions; all these would have served to convince
any men that we were no pirates. The opium, and
other goods we had on ‘board, would make it ap-
pear the ship had been at Bengal; the Dutchmen,
who, it was said, had the names of all the men
that were in the ship, might easily see that we
were a. mixture of English, Portuguese, and Indi-ans,_
and but two Dutchmen on board. These and
many other particular circumstances might have
made it evident to the understanding of any com-
mander, whose hands we might fall into, that we
were no pirates. »
But fear, that blind, useless passion, worked an-
other way, and threw us into the vapours: it be-
wildered our Ul1(l€l‘SttIl1Clli.lf._,'Sy and set the imagina-
tion at work, to form at thousand terrible things
that, perhaps, might never happen. We first sup_
posed, as indeed every body had related to us, that
the seamen on board the. English and Dutch ships,
but especially the Dutch, were so enraged at the
name of a pirate. and especially at our beating off
their boats, and escaping, that they would not give
themselves leave to inquire, whether we were
pirates or no; but would execute us o’ lmml, as
we call it, without giving us any room for a. de-
fence. We reected, that there was really so much
apparent -evidence before them, that they would
scarce inquire after any more; as, rst, that the
ship was certainly the same, -land that some of the
seamen amongvthem knew her, and had been on
board her; and, secondly, that when we had intel-
ligence at the river Cambodia, that they were com-
ing down to examine us, we fought their boats, and
ed; so that we inade no doubt but they were as
fully satisfied of our being pirates, as we were satis-
ed of the contrary: and I often said, I knew not
but I should lmve been apt to have taken the like
circumstances for evidence, if the tables were
turned, and my case was theirs, and have made no
scruple of cutting all the crew to pieces, without
believing, or perhaps considering/, what they might
have to offer in their defence.
But let that be how it will, those were our ap-
prehensions; and both my partner and 1 too scarce
slept a night ‘without_di-eaming of halters and
yard-arms, that is to say, gibbets; of ghting, and
‘being taken; of killing, and being killed; and -one
night I was in such a fury in my dream, fancyi-ng
the Dutchmen had boarded us, and I was knocking
one of their seamen down, that I struck my doubled
st agaiiist the side of the cabin Ilay, in, with such
a force as wounded my hand most grievously,
broke myiknuckles, and cut and bruised the esh,
so that it not only awaked me out of my sleep, but
I was once afraid I should have lost two of my
ngers. i l
Another apprehension I had, was, of the cruel
usage we should meet with from them, if we fell
into their hands. Then the story of Amboyna
came into my head, and how the Dutch might, per-
haps, tortnre us, as they did our countrymen there,
and make some of our rnen. _bv extremity of tors
ture, eomess tnose crimes wmcu they never were
U1
@
Qt
guilty of ; own themselves, and all of us, to be
pirates, and so they would put us to death, with a
formal appearance of justice ; and that they might
be tempted to do this, for the gain of our ship and
cargo, which was worth four or five thousand
pounds, put all together. I
These things tormented me and my partner too,
night and day; nor did we consider that the cap-
tains of ships have no authority to act thus; and
if we had surrendered prisoners to them, they
could not answer the destroying us, or torturing
us, but would be accountable for it when they
came into their own country; this, I say, gave me
no satisfaction, for if they will act thus with us,
what advantage would it be to us, -that they would
be called to account for it; or, if we were rst to
be murdered, what satisfaction would it be to us to
have them punished when they came home?
I cannot refrain taking notice here what reec-
tions I now had upon the past variety of my par-
ticular circumstances; how hard I thought it was,
that T, who had spent forty years in a life of con-
tinued diiliculties, and was, at last, come, as it
were, to the port or haven which all men drive at,
viz. to have rest and plenty, should be a volunteer
in new sorrows, by my own unhappy choice; and
that I, who had escaped so many dangers in my
youth, should now come to he hanged in my old
age, and in so remote a place, for a crime I was
not in the least inclined to, much less guilty of, and
in a place and circumstance, where innocence was
not like to be any protection at all to me.
After these thoughts, something of religion would
come in; and I would be considering that this
seemed to me to be a disposition of immediate Pro-
vidence, and I ought to look upon‘ it, and submit to
it, as such ; that although I was innocent as to men,
I was far from being innocent as to my Maker;
and I ought to look in, and e.\'amine what other
Crimes in my life were most obvious to me, and
~
for which Providence might justly inict this pu-
nishment, as a retribution; and that I ought to sub-
mit to this, just as I would to a shipwreck, if it
had pleased God to have brought such a disaster
upon me. _ 4
In its turn, natural courage would sometimes
take its place, and then I would be talking myself
up to vigorous resolutions, _that I would not be
taken, to be barbarously used, by a parcel of mer-
ciless wretehes, in cold blood; that it was much
better to have fallen into the hands of the savages,
who were men-eaters, and who, I was sure, would
feast upon me, when they had taken me, than
by those who would, perhaps, glut their rage
upon me by inhuman tortures and barb-arities;
that, in the case oi’ the savages, I always resolv-
ed to die ghting to the last gasp; and why
should I not do so now, seeing it was much more
dreadful to me, at least, to think of falling into
these men’s hands, than ever it was to think of
being eaten by men; for the savages, give them
their due, would not eat a man till he was dead,
and killed him rst, as we do a bullock ; but that
these men had many arts beyond the cruelty of
death. Whenever these thoughts prevailed, I was
sure to put myself into a kind of fever with the
agitat-ions of a supposed ght: my bloodrwould
boil, and my eyes sparkle, as if‘ I was engaged;
and I always resolved that I would take no quar-
ter at their hands; but even, at last, if 1 could
resist no longer, I would blow up the ship, and all
that was in her, and leave them but little booty to
boast of. .
By how much the greater weight the anxieties
and perplexities of these things were to '0ur
thoughts while we were at sea, by so much the
greater was our satisfaction, when we saw our-
selves on shore; and my partner told me he
dreamed that he had a very heavy load upon his
back, which he was to carry up a hill, and found
that he was not able to stand long under it; but
the Portuguese pilot came, and took it o’ his
back, and the hill disappeared, the ground before
him showing all smooth "and plain. And truly it
was so; we were all like men who had a load taken
off their backs.
For my part, I had a weight taken o’ from my
heart, that 1 was not able any longer to bear; and,
as 1 said above, we resolved to go no more to sea in
that ship. When we came on shore, the old pilot,
who was now our friend, got us a lodging, and a
warehouse for our goods, which, by the way, was
much the same: it was a little house, or hut, with
a large house joining to it, all built with canes, and
palisadoed round with large canes, to keep out pil-
fering thieves, of which, it seems, there were not a
few in the country. I~Io-wever, the magistrates allow-
ed us also a little guard, and we had a soldier, with a
kind of halbert, or halfpike, who stood sentinel at
our door, to whom we allowed a pint of rice, and
a little piece of money,about the value of three-pence
per day, so that our goods were kept very safe. 4
The fair, or mart, usually kept. in this place, had
been over some time : however, we found that there
were three or four junks in the river, and two
Japanese, I mean ships from Japan, with goods
which they had bought ‘in China, and were not
gone away, having Japanese merchants on shore.
The rst thing our old Portuguese pilot did for
us, was, to bring us acquainted with three mis-
sionary Romish priests, who were in the town, and
who had been there some time, converting the
people to Christianity; but we thought they made
but poor work of it, and made them but sorry
Christians when they had done. I-Iowever that
was not our business. One of these was a
Frenchman, whom they called Father Simon: he
was a jolly, well-conditioned man, very free in his
conversation, not seeming so serious and grave as
the other two did; one of whom was a Portu-
C
guese, and the other a Genoese; but Father Simon
was courteous, easy in his manner, and very agree-
able company; the other two were more reserved,
seemed rigid and austere, and applied seriously to
the work they came about, viz. to talk -with, and
insinuate themselves among the inhabitants, wher-
ever they had opportunity. We often eat and
drank with those men : and though I must confess
the conversion, as they callit, of the Chinese to
Christianity, is so far from the true conversion re-
quired to bring heathen people to the faith of
Christ, that it seems to amount to little more than
letting them know, the name of Christ, say some
prayers to the Virgin Mary and her Son, in a
tongue which they understand not, and» to cross
themselves, and the like ; yet it must be confessed
that these religious, whom we call missionaries,
have a firm belief, that these people shall be saved,
and that they are the instrument of it; and, on
this account, they undergo, not only the fatigue of
the voyage, and hazards of living in such places,
but oftentimes death itself, with the most violent
tortures, for the sake of this work ; and it would be
a great want of charity in us, whatever opinion we
have of the work itself, and the manner of their
doing it, if we should not have a good opinion of
their zeal, who undertake it with so many hazards,
and who have no prospect of the least temporal ad-
vantage to themselves.
But to return to my story: this French priest,
Father Simon, was appointed, it seems, by order of
the chief of the mission, to go up to Pekin, the
royal seat of the Chincso emperor, and waited
only for another priest, who was ordered to come
to him from Macao, to go along with him, and we
scarce ever met together, but he was inviting me
to go that journey with him, telling me how he
would show mo all the glorious things of that
mighty empire, and among-the rest, the greatest
city in the world, ‘ a city,’ said he, ' that your
I
1
London and our Paris, put together, cannot be
equal to.’ This was the city of Pekin, which, I
confess, is very great, and innitely full of peo-
ple; but as I -looked on those things with differ-
ent eyes from other men, so I shall give my opinon
of them in a few words, when I come, in the
course of my travels, to speak more particularly of
them.
But, rst, I come to my Friar, or missionary: din-
ing with him one (lay, and being very merry toge-
ther, I showed seine littleinelination to go with
him, and he pressed mo and my partner very hard,
and with a great many persuasions, to consent.
‘ Why, Father Simon,’ says my partner, ‘ why
should you desire our company so mneh? You
know we are heretics, and you do not love us, nor
can keep us company with any pleasure.’ ‘ O,’ says
he, ‘ you may, perhaps, be good catholics in time:
my business here is to convert heathens ; and who
knows hut l may convert you too?’ ‘Very well,
Father,’ said I; ‘so you will preach to us all the
way.’ ‘ l will not be troublesome to you,’ said he.
‘ Our religion does not divest us of good manners:
besides,’ said _he, ‘we are hero like countrymen,
and so we are, compared to the place we are in;
and if you are hngonots, and I a catholic, we may
be all Christians at last; at least,’ said he, ‘ we
are all gentlemen, and we may converse so, with-
out being uneasy to one another.’ I liked that part
of his discourse very well, and it began to put me
in mind oi‘ my priest, that I had left in the Brasils;
hut this Father Simon did not come up to his cha-
racter by a great deal; for though Father Simon
had no appearance of a criminal levilzy in him nei-
l;lier, yet he had not that fund ol’ Christian zeal,
strict piety, and sincere aixction to religion, that
my: other good eeclesinstie had, of whom 1 have
said so much. V
Bur. to leave him a little, though heneverleft us,
eior soliciting us to go with him; but we had some-
thing else before us at that time, for we had all this-
while our ship, and our merchandise, to dispose of:
"and we began to be very doubtful what we should
do, for we were now in a place of very little busi-
ness; and once I was about to venture to sail for
the river Kilam, and the city of Nanquin ; but Pro-
vidence seemed now more visibly, as I thought,
than ever, to concern itself in our affairs; and I
was encouraged from this very time to think I
should, one way or other, get out of this tangled
circumstance, and be brought home to my own
country again, though I had not the least view of
the manner; and,when I began sometimes to think
of it, could not imagine by what method it was to
be done. Proviilence, I say, began here to clear up
our way a little; and the rst thing that oilered,
was, that our old Portuguese pilot brought a Japan
merchant to us, who began to inquire what goods
we had; and, in the rst place, he bought all our
opium, and gave us a very good .p1-ice for it, paying
us in gold, by weight, some in small pieces of their
own coin, and some in small wedges, ofabont ten
or eleven ounces each. While we were dealing
with him for our opium, it came into myhcad that
he might, perhaps, deal with us for the ship too;
and'I ordered the interpreter to propose it to him.
He shrunk up his shoulders at it, when it was rst
proposed to him, but, in a few days after, he came
to me, with one of the missionary priests for his
interpreter, and told me he had a proposal to make
to me, and that was this: he had bought a great
quantity of goods of us, when he had no thoughts,
or proposals made to him, of buying the ship; and
that, therefore, he had not money enough to pay
for the ship: but if I would let the same men who
were in the ship navigate her, he would hire the
ship to go to Japan, and would send them from
thence to the Philippine islands with another load-
ing, which he would pay the freight of, before they
went from Japan, and that, at their return, he
tn
—z
I-5
would buy the ship. I beganto listen to this pro-
posal, and so eager did my head still run upon
rambling, that I could not but begin to entertain a
notion myself of going with him, and so to sail
from the Philippine islands away to the South
Seas; and accordingly I asked the Japanese mer-
chant, il’ he would not hire us to the Philippine.
islands, and discharge us there. He said, no, he
could not do that, for then he could not have the
return of his cargo; but he would discharge us in
Japan, he said, at the ship's return. Well, still I was
for taking him at that proposal, and going myself;
but my partner, wiser than myself, persuaded me
from it, representing the dangers, as well ot‘ the
seas as of the Japanese, who are a false, cruel,
and treacherous people, and then of the Spaniards
at the Philippines, more false, more cruel, more
treacherous, than they.
But to bring this long turn of our affairs to a
conclusion, the rst thing we had to do was to
consult with the captain of the ship, and with the
men, and know it' they were willing to go ‘to Ja-
pan; and, while I was doing this, the young man,
whom, as Isaid, my nephew had left with me as my
companion for my travels, came to me, and told
inc, that he thought that voyage promised very fair,
and that there was a great prospect of advantage,
and he would be very glad if I undertook it; but
that if I would not, and would give him leave, he
would go as a merchant, or how I pleased to order
him; that if ever he came to England, and I was
there, and alive, he would render me a i’aitlil’ul
account of his success, and it should be as much
mine as I pleased.
I was really loath to part with him, but consider-
ing the prospect of advantage, which was really con-
siderable, and that he was a young fellow as likely
to do well in it as any I knew, I inclined to let
him go; but rst I told him, I would consult my
partner, and give him an answer the next day. My
partner and I discoursed about it; and my partner
made a most generous offer. I-Ie told mo, ‘ You
know it has been an unlucky ship, and we both re-
solved not to go to sea in it again : if your steward
(so he called my man) will venture the voyage, I’ll
leave my share of the vessel to him, and lot him
make the best of it; and if we live to meet in
England, and he meets with success abroad, he shall
account for one half of the prots of the ship‘:
freight to us, the other shall be his own.’ -
If my partner, who was no way concerned with
my young man, made him such an offer, I could
do no less than offer him the same; and all the
ship’s company being willing to go with him, we
made over half the ship to him in property, and
took a writing from him, ohliging him to account
for the other; and away he went to Japan. The
Japan merchant proved a very punctual, honest
man to him, protected him at Japan, and got him a
licence to come on shore, which the Europeans in
general have not lately obtained, paid him his
freight very punctually, sent him to the Philippines
loaded with Japan and China wares, and a super-
eargo of their own, who, traicliing with the Spa.-
niards, brought back European goods again, and a
great quantity of cloves and other spice: and there
he was not only paid his l’reip;ht very well, and at a
very good price, but being not willing to sell the
ship then, the merchant Furnished him with goods
con his own account; that for some money, and
some spices. oi’ his own, which he brought with
him, he wcnt back to the Manill-as to the Spa-
niards, where he sold his cargo very well. Here,
having gotten a good acquaintance at Manilla, he
got his ship made a free ship; and the gover-
nor ol’ Manilla hired him to go to Aeeapnlen, igi
America, on the coast of Mexico; and gave him a
licence to land there, and travel to Mexico, and
to pass in any Spanish ship to Europe, with all his
men.
I-Ie made the voyage to Accapulco very happily,
and there he sold his ship: and having there also
obtained allowance to travel by land to Porto Bello,
he found means, some how or other, to go to Jamaica
with -all his treasure, and about eight years after
came to England exceeding rich: of which I shall
take notice in its place. In the mean time, Ire-
turn to our particular affairs.
Being now to part with the ship, and ship's com-
pany, it came before us, of course, to consider what
recompense we should give to the two men that
gave us such timely notice of the design against us
in the river of Cambodia. The truth was, they
had done us a considerable service, and deserved
well at our hands ; though. by the way, they were
a couple of rogues too; for as they believed the
story of our being pirates, and that we had really
run away with the ship, they came down to us, not
only to betray the design that was formed against
us, but to go to sea with us as pirates; and one
of them eonlcssed afterwards, that nothing else but
the hopes of going a roguing brought him to do it.
However, the service they did us was ndt the less;
and therefore, as I had promised to be grateful to
them, 1 rst ordered the money to be paid to them,
which they said was due to them on board their
respective ships, that is to say, to the Englishman
nineteen months’ pay, and to the Dutchman seven;
and, over and above that, I gave eaoh of them a
small sum of money in gold, which contented them
very well: then I made tho Englishman gunner in
the ship, the gunner being now made second mate
and purscr; the Dutchman I made boatswain. So
they were both very well pleased, and proved very
serviceable, being both able seamen, and very stout
fellows. -
We were now on shore in China. If I thought
myself banished, and remote from my own country
at Bengal, where Iliad many ways to get home for
my money, what could I think of myself now,
when I was gotten about a thousand leagues farther
off from home, and perfectly destitute of all man-
ner of prospect of return!
All we had for it was this, that, in about four
months’ time there was to be another fair at that
place where we were, and then we might be able
topurchase all ‘sorts of the manufactures of the
country, and, withal,. might possibly nd some
Chinese junks, or vessels, from Nanquin, that
would be to be sold, and would carry us and our
goods whither we pleased. This I liked very
well, and resolved to wait; besides,ias our par-
ticular persons were 'not obnoxious, so if any
English or Dutch ships came thither, perhaps we
might have an opportunity to load our goods, and
get passage to some other place in India nearer
home.
Upon these hopes we resolved to continue here;
but, to divert ourselves, we took two or three
journeys into the country. First," we went ten
days’ journey to see the city of Nanquin, acity well
worth seeing indeed. They say it has a million of
people irit, which, however, I do not believe: it
is regularly built, the streets all exactly strait, and
cross one another in direct lines, which gives the
gure of it great advantage.
But when I came to compare the miserable peo-
ple of these countries with ours; their fabrics, their
manner of living, their government, their religion,
their wealth, and their glory (as some call it), I must
confess I<do not so much as think it worth naming,
or worthmy while to Write of, or any that shall
come after me to read.
It is very observable, that we wonderat the
grandeur, the riches, the pomp, the ceremonies, the
government, the manufactures, the commerce, and
the conduct of -these people; not that it is to be
wondered at, or indeed in theleast to be regarded.
but because having rst a notion of the barbarity of
those countries, the rudeness and the ignorance
that prevail there, we do not expect to nd any such
things so far o‘.
Otherwise what are their buildings to the palaces
and royal buildings of Europe? What their trade,
to the universal commerce of England, Holland,
France, and Spain? What their cities to ours, for
wealth, strength, gaiety of apparel, rich furniture,
and an innite variety? 'What are their ports, sup-
plied with a few junks and barks, to our naviga»
tion, our merchants’ eets, our large and powerful
navies? Our city of London has more trade than
all their mighty empire. One English, or Dutch, or
French man of war, of eighty guns, would ght
with, and destroy. all the shipping of China. But
the greatness of their wealth, their trade, the power
of their government, and strength of their armies, is
surprising to us ; because, as I have said, consider-
ing ‘them as a barbarous nation of pagans, little
better than savages, we did not expect such things
among them ; and this indeed is the advantage with
which all their greatness and power is represented
to us ; otherwise it. is in itself nothing at all, for, as
I have said of their ships, so may be said of their
armies and troops; all the forces of their empire,
though they were to bring two millions of men
into‘ the eld together, would be able to do nothing
but ruin the country, and starve themselves. If
they were to besiege a strong town in Flanders, or
to ght a disciplined army, one line of German
cuirassiers, or of I-‘rcnch cavalry, would overthrow
all the horse of China ; a million of their foot could
not stand before one embattled body of our infan-
try, posted so as not to be surrounded, though they
were not to be one-and-twenty in number; nay, I
do not boast if I say that thirty thousand German
or English foot, and ten thousand French horse,
would fairly beat all the forces of China. And so
of our fortied towns, and of the art of our en-
gineers in assaulting and defending towns: there
is not a fortied town in China could hold out one
month against the batteries and attacks of an Euro.
pean army; and, at the same time, all the armies of
China could never take such a town as Dunkirk,
provided it was not starved; no, not in ten years’
siege. They have re-arms,"it is true ;' but they are
awkward, clumsy, and uncertain in going oif; they
have powder, but it is of no strength; they have
neither discipline» in the eld, exercise to their
arms, skill to attack, nor temper_to retrea.t; and
therefore I must confess it .seemed,st1"ange to me,
when I came home, and heard our people say such
ne things of the power,riches, glory, magnicence,
and trade of the Chinese, because I saw and knew
that they were a contcmptible herd, or crowd, of
ignorant, sordid slaves, subjected to a government
qualied only to rule such a people; and, in a
word, for I am now launched quite beside my de-
sign, I say, in a word, were not its distance incon-
eeivably great from Museovy, and were not the
Muscovite empire almost as rude, impotent, and ill-
governed a crowd of slaves as they, the czar of
Mnscovy might, with much ease, drive them all out
of their country, and conquer them in one cam-
paign; and had the czar, who, I since hear, is a
growing prince, and begins to appear formidable in
the world, fallen -this way, instead of attacking the
warlike Swedes, in which attempt none of the
powers of Europe would have envied or inter-
rupted him, he might,-by this time,‘ have been em-
peror of China, instead of being beaten by the
king oI’iSwcden at Narva, when the latter was not
one to six in number. As their strength and their
grandeur, so their navigation, commerce, and lins-
bandry, is imperfect and impotent, compared to the
same things in Europe; also in their knowledge,
their learning, their skill in the sciences, they have
globes and spheres, and a smatch of the knowledge
of the mathematics; but when you come to inquire
into their knowledge, how short-sighted are the
wisest of their students! They know nothing of
u
the motion of the heavenly bodies; and are so grossly,
absurd-iy ignorant, that when the sun is eclipsed,
they think it is a great dragon has assaulted and
run away with it, and they fall a clattering with
all the drums and kettles in the country, to fright
the monster away, just as we do to hive a swarm
of bees.
As this is the only excursion of this kind which I
have made in all the account I have given of my
travels, so I shall make no more descriptions of
countries and people, it is none of my business, or
any part of my design; but giving an account of my
own adventures, through a life of inimitable wan~
derings and a long variety of changes, which, per-
haps, few have heard the like of, I shall say nothing
of the mighty places, desert ‘countries, and numen
ous people, I have yet to pass through, more than
relates to my own story, and'which my concern
among them will make necessary. I was now, as
near as I can compute, in the heart of China, about
the latitude of thirty degrees north of the line, for
we were returned from Nanquin. I had indeed n
mind to see the city of Pelcin, which I had heard so
much of, and Father Simon importuned me daily to
do it. At length his time of going away being set,
and the other missionary, who was to go with him,
being arrived from Macao, it was necessary that we
should resolve either to go, or not to go: so I re-
.ferred him to my partner, and left it wholly to his
choice, who, at -length, resolved it in the _afrma-
tive; and we prepared for our journey. Weset
out with very good advantage, as to nding the
‘way; for we got leave to travel in the retinue of
one of their mandarins, a kind of-viceroy, or prin-
cipal magistrate, in the province where tliey reside,
and who take great state upon them,’ travelling
with great attendance, and with great homage from
the people, who are sometimes greatly iinpoverislxed
by them, because all the countries they pass through
are obliged to furnish provisionstbr them, and all
2 C!
their attendants‘. That which I particularly ob.
served, as to our travelling with his baggage, was
this, that though we received suicient provisions,
both for ourselves and our horses, from the coun-
try, as belonging to the mandarin, yet‘we were
obliged to pay for every thing we had, after the
market-price of the country, and the mandarin’s
steward, or coromissary of the provisions, collected
it duly from us, so that our travelling in the re-
tinue of the mandarin, though it was a very great
kindness to us, was not such a mighty favour in
him, but was indeed a great advantage to him,
considering there were about thirty other people
travelled in the same manner besides us, under
the protection of his retinue, or, as we may call
it, under his convoy. This, I say, was a great ad-
vantage to him; for the country furnished all the
provisions for nothing, and he took all our money
for them.
We were ve-and-twenty days travelling to Pelcin,
through a country innitely populous, but miser-
ably cultivated; the husbandry, economy, and the
way of living, all very miserable, though they boast
so much of the industry of the people; I say,
miserable, and so it is, if we, who understand how
to live, were to endure it, or to compare it with
our own; but not so to these poor wretches who
know no other. The pride of these people is in-
nitely great, and exceeded by nothing but their
poverty, which adds to that which I call their
misery. I must needs think the naked savages of
America live much more happy, because, as they
have nothing, so they desire nothing; whereas
these are proud and insolent, and, in the main,
are mere beggars and drudges: their ostentation
is inexpressible, and is chiey shown in their
clothes and buildings, and in the keeping, multi-
tudes of servants, or slaves, and, which is to the
last degree ridiculous, their contempt of _all the
world but themselves. ' .
I must confess, I travelled more pleasantly after-
wards in the deserts and vast wildernesses of Grand
Tartary, than here: and yet the roads here are
well paved, and well kept, and very convenient for
travellers; but nothing was more awkward to me
than to see such a haughty, imperious, insolent
people, in the "midst of the grossest simplicity and
ignorance; for all their famed ingenuity is no
more. My friend, Father Simon, and I, used to be
very merry upon these-occasions, to see the beg-
garly pride ofthose people; for example, coming
by the house of a country gentleman, as Father
Simon called him, about ten leagues o' of the city
of Nanquin, we had, rst of all, the honour to ride
with the master of the house, about two miles: the
state he rode in, was a perfect Don Quixotism, being
a mixture of pomp and poverty. '
The habit of this greasy Don was very proper for
a scaramoueh, or merry-andrew, being a dirty
calico, with all the tawdry trappings of a fool's
coat, such as hanging sleeves, taffety, and cuts
and slashes almost on every side. It covered a
rich taffety vest, as greasy as a buteher’s, and which
testified that his honour must needs be a most ex-
quisite sloven. -
His horse was a poor, lean, starved, hobbling
creature, such as in England might sell for about
thirty or forty shillings; and he had two slaves
followed him on foot to drive the poor creature
along. He had a whip in his hand, and he be-
laboured the beast as fast about the head as his
slaves did about the tail; and thus he rode by us
with about ten or twelve servants, and we were
told he was going from the city to his country seat,
about half a league before us. We travelled on
gently, but this gure of a gentleman rode away
before us; and as we stopped at a village about an
hour to refresh us, when we came by the country
seat of this great man, we saw him in a little
place, before his door, eating his repast: it was a
kind of a garden, but he was easy to be seen, and
_wo were given to understand that the more we
looked on him the better he would be pleased.
He sat under a tree, somethingilike the palmetto
-‘tree, .w,~h_ich effectually shaded him over the head,
and on the.-south, side; but under the tree also
was placed a 1arge.umbrella, -which made that part
look well. enougli. He sat lolling back in a great
elbow-chair, being a_ heavy, corpulent man, and his
meat -being brought him by two women slaves, he
had two more, whose .oiee, I think, few gentlemen
in Europe would accept of their service in, viz. one
fed the squire with a spoon, and the other held the
dish with one hand, andscraped oil’ what he let
fal-1 upon his .worship’s beard and taffety vest with
_-the other, while, thegreat, fat brute thought it
below him to employ his own hands in any oi’ those
familiar ofces which kings and monarchs would
rather do, than be troubled-with the clumsy ngers
of their servants.
I took this time to think what pains men’s pride
puts them to, and how troublesome a haughty
temper,» thus iill- managed, must be to a man of
common sense‘; and leaving the poor wretch to
please himself with our looking at him, as if we
admired bis, pomp, whereas we really pitied and
contemned him, we. pursued ourjourney-2 only Fa-
ther Simon bad the curiosity to stayito inform him-
self what dainties the.eountry justice had to feed
on, -in all his.statc,.which he said he had the honour
to taste of, and which was, I think, a dose that an
English hound would scarce have eaten, if it had
been offered him, viz.ia mess of boiled rice, with a
great. piece of garlic -in it, and a little bag filled
with green pepper, and another plant which they
have there, something like our ginger, but smell-
ing like musk, and tasting like mustard. All this
was put together, and a small lump or piece of
lean mutton boiled in it: and this was his wor-i
ship’s repast, four or ve servants more attending
at a distance. If he fed them meauer than he was
fed himself, the spice excepted, they must fare very
coarsely indeed.
As for our mandarin, with -whom we travelled, he
was respected like a king, surrounded always with
his gentlemen, and attended in all his appearances
with such pomp, that I saw little of him but at a
distance; but I observed that there was not a horse
in his’ retinue, but that our carriers’ pack-horses in
England seem to me to look much better; but they
were so covered with equipage, mantles, trappings,
and such like trumpery, that you could not see whe-
ther they were fat or lean. In a word, we could see
scarce any thing but their feet and their heads.
I was now light-hearted, and all my trouble and
perplexity, that I havegiven an account of, being
over, I had no anxious thoughts about me, which
made this journey much the pleasanter to me; nor
had I any ill accident attended me, only in the pass-
ing or fording a small river, my horse fell, and made
me free of the country, as they call it; that is to
say, threw me in: the place was not deep, but it
wetted me all over. I mention it because it spoiled
my pocket-book, wherein I had set down the names
of several people and places which I had occasion
to remember, and which not taking due care of‘, the
leaves rotted, and the words were never after to be
read, to my great loss as to the names of some
places which I‘ touched at in this voyage.
At length we arrived at Pekin. I had nobody
with me but the youth whom my nephew, the cap-
tain, had given me to attend me as a servant, and
who proved very trusty and diligent; and my part-
ner hadnobody with him but one servant, who was
a kinsman. As for the Portuguese pilot, he being
desirous to see the court, we gave him his passage,
that is to say, bore his charges for his company,
and to use him as an interpreter, for he understood
the language of the country, and spoke good French,
and a little English ; and indeed this old man was a
most useful implement to us every where; for we
had not been above a week at Pekin, when he
came laughing, ‘ Ah, seignior Inglese,’ said he, ‘ I
have something to tell you, will~make your heart
glad.’ ‘ My heart glad !’ said I5 ‘ Whatcan that
be? I don’t know any thing in this country can
either give me joy or grief, to any great degree.’
‘ Yes, yes,’ said the old man, in broken English,
‘ make you glad, me sorrow:’ sorry, he would have
said. This made me more inquisitive. ‘ Why,’ said
I, ‘ will it make you sorry?’ ‘ Because,’ said he,
‘ you have brought me here twenty-ve days’ jour-
ney, and will leave me to go hack alone, and
which way shall 1 get to my port afterwards, with-
out a ship, without a horse, without pecune?' so
he called money, being his broken Latin, of which
he had abundance to make us merry with.
In short, he told us there was a great caravan of
Muscovite and Polish merchants in the city, and
they were preparing to set out on their journey,
by land, to Muscovy, within four or ve weeks, and
he was sure we would take the opportunity to go
with them, and leave him behind to go back all
alone. I confess I was surprised with his news: a
secret joy spread itself over my whole soul, which
I cannot describe, and never felt, before or since;
and I had no power, for a good while, to speak a
word to the old man, but at last I turned to him,
‘ How do you know this?’ said I. ‘ Are you sure
it is true?’ ‘ Yes,’ said he, ‘ I met this morning, in
the street, an oldiacquaintance of mine, an Arme-
nian, or one you call a Grecian, who is among
them; he came last from Astracan, and was de-
signing to go to Tonquin, where I formerly .knew
him, but has altered his mind, and is now resolved
to go back with the caravan to\Moscow, and so
down the river of Wolga to Astracan.’ ‘r Well,
seignior,’ said I, 4 do not be uneasy about being
left to goback alone: if this be a method for my
return to England, it shall be your fault, if you go
back to Macao at all.’ We then went to consult-
ing together what was to be done; and I asked my
partner what he thought of the pilot’s news, and
whether it would suit with his affairs. He told me
he would do just as I would, for he. had settled all
his affairs so well at Bengal, and left his effects in
such good hands, that as we had made a good
voyage here, if he could vest it in China silks,
wrought and raw, such as might be worth the ear-
riage, he would be content to go to England, and
then make his voyage back to Bengal by the Com-
pany’s ships. _
i Having resolved upon this, we agreed that if our
Portugal pilot would go with us, we would bear
his charges to Moscow, or to England, if he pleas-
ed; nor indeed were we to be esteemed over gene-
rous in that part neither, if we had not rewarded
him farther; for the service he had done us was
really worth all that, and more, for he had not only
been a pilot to us at sea, but he had been also like
a broker for us on shore; and his procuring for us
the Japan merchant was some hundreds of pounds
in our pockets. So we consulted together about it,
and being willing to gratify him, which was indeed
but doing him justice, and very willing also to
have him with us besides, for he was a most neces-
sary man on all occasions, we agreed to give him a
quantity of coined gold, which, as I compute it,
came to about one hundred and seventy-live pounds
sterling between us, and to bear his charges, both for
himself and horse, except only a horse to carry his
goods.
Having settled this among ourselves, we called
him to let him know what we had resolved. I told
him he had complained of our being like to let him
go back alone, and I was now to tell him we were
resolved he should not go back at all: that as we
had resolved to go to Europe with the caravan, we
resolved also he should go with us, and that we
cailed him to know his mind. He shook his head,
and said it was a long journey, and he had no
pecune to carry him thither,.;nor _to_subsist himself
when hecame thither. iwfe told him we believed ii;
was so, and therefore we had resolved to do some-
thing for him,; thatshduld let him see how sensible
we were of the service, he-had,r_lone us, and also
how.agreeab_le_he was to us“; and then I told him
what we had fI350lV€Ll to. give him here, which he
might layout as we would do our own, and that
as for hischarges, if he would go with us, we would
set him safe ashore (life and casualties excepted)
either in Muscovy or England, which he would, at
our own charge, except only the carriage of his
goods. ’ ~ . 1 _
- He received the proposal like a man transported,
and told us, he would go with us over the whole
world ; and so, in short, we all prepared ourselves
for the journey. However, as it was with us, so it
was with the other merchants, .they had many
things to do‘; and, instead of being ready in ve
weeks, it was fourmfonths and some odd days bee
fore all things were gottogether. r
It was the beginning of February, our style,
when we set out from Pekin. My partner and
the .old pilotliadgone express back to the port
where we had rst put in, to dispose of some goods
which we had left there ; and I, with a Chinese
merchant, whom I had some knowledge of at‘Nan-
qnin, and who came to Pekin on his own aairs,
went to Nanquin, where I bought ninety pieces of
ne damasks, with about two .hnndred,pic'ccs' ‘of
other very ne silks, of several sorts, some mixed-
with gold; and had all these brought toiPekin
against my partner’s return. Besides 3 this, 'we
boughta very large quantity'of.raw_silk,. and" some
other goods; our cargo amounting, in these goods
only, to about three thousand ve hundred pounds
.sterling, which, together with tea, and some ne
ealicoes, and three camelloadsz. of "nutmegs I-and
cloves, loaded in all eighteen camels for our share,
\
besides those" we-rode upon, which, with two or
three ‘spare Horses, and two horses loaded with pro-
visions‘, made us, in short, twenty-six camels and
horses in ’our’rei1ue. ‘
~-T he c‘or'nf>any was jvery" great, and, as near as I
can reinembeiniade between three and four hun.
df"ed'hoi‘ses and camels, and‘ upwards of a hun-
d1~ed'1‘dd'twenty men, very well aimed, and pro-
vided‘for -an events: for as the eastern caravans
are'subject to be attacked by the Arabs, so are
these by the Tartars ; but they are not altogether so
dangerous as the"Arabs, nor so barbarous when they
prevail. -
The company consisted of people of several na~
tions, such as Muscovites chiey, for there were
above sixty of them who were merchants or inha-
bitants of Moscow, though of them some were Li-
vonians, and, to our particular satisfaction, ve
of them were Scots, who appeared also to be men
of great experience in business, and of very good
substance.
When we had travelled one day’s journey, the
guides, who were ve in number, called all the gen-
tlemen and merchants, that is to say, all the pas.
sengers, except the servants, to a great council, as
they termed it. At this great council every one
deposited a certain quantity of money to a com-
mon stock, for the necessary expense of buying for-
age on the way, where it was not otherwise to be
had, and for satisfying the guides, getting horses,
and the like. And here they constituted the jour.
ney, as they called it, viz. they named captains and
officers to draw us all up, and give the command in
case of an attack, and gave every one their turn of
command. Nor was this forming us into order any
more than what we found needful upon the way,
as shall be observed in its place.
The road on all this side of the country is very
populous, and is full of potters, and earth-makers,
that is to say, people that tempered the earth for
2 C 2
the China ware; and, as I was going along, our Por-
tugal pilot, who had always something or other to
say tom-al<e us merry, came sneering to me, and
told rne, he would show me the greatest rarity in all
the country, and that I should have this to say of
China, after all the ill-humoured things 1 had said
of it, thatl had seen one thing which was not to be
seen in allthe world beside. I was very importa-
nate to know what it was; at last, he told me, it
was a gentleman’s house, built all with China ware.
‘ Well,’ said I, ‘ are not the materials of their build-
ing the product of their own country? and so it is
all China ware, is it not?’ ‘ No, no,’ says he, ‘ I
mean it is a house allmade of China ware, such
as you call so in England, or, as it is called in our
country, porcelain.’ ‘ Well,’ said.I, ‘ such a thing
may he. How big is it? Can we carry it in a box
upon a camel? If we can, we-.will buy it.’ ‘ Upon
a camel!’ said the old pilot, holding up both his
fhands; ‘ why there is a family of thirty people
lives in it.’
1 was then curious inde.ed to see it, and when I
came to it, it was nothing but this: it was a timber
house, or a house built, as we call it in England,
with lath and plaster, -but all the plastering was
really China ware, that is to say, it was rplastered
with the earth that makes China ware. _ -
The outside, which the sun shone hot upon, was
glazed, and looked very well, perfectly white, and
painted with blue gures, as the large China ware
in, England is painted, and hard as if it had been
burned. As to the inside, all the walls, instead of
wainscot, were.lined up with hardenedand painted
tiles, like the little square tiles we call gally-tiles
in England, all made of the nest China, and the
gures exceedingly ne indeed, with extraordinary
variety of colours, mixed with gold, many tiles
making butone gure, but joined so articially
with mortar, being made of the same earth, that
it was very, hard to see where the tiles met, The
oors of the rooms were of the same composition,
and as hard as the earthen oors we have in use in
several parts of England, especially Lincolnshire,
Nottinghamshire, Leicestershire, &c. - as hard as
stone, and smooth, but not burned and painted,
except some smaller rooms, like closets, which we're
all, as it were, paved with the same tile, the cicli-ngs,
and, in a word, all the plastering work in the whole
house, were of the same earth; and, after all, the
roof was covered with tiles of the same, but of a
deep, shining black. i
This was a China warehouse, indeed, truly and
literally to be called so; and, had I not been upon
the journey, I could have staid some days to
see and examine the particulars of it. They told
me there were fountains and sh-ponds in the gar-
den, all paved at the bottom and sides with the
same, and ne statues set up in rows on the walks,
entirely formed of the porcelain earth, and burned
whole. '
As this is one of the singularities of China, so
they may be allowed to excel in it; but I am very
sure they excel in their accounts of it, for they
told me such incredible things of their performance
in crockery ware, for such it is, that I care not to
relate, as knowing it could not be true. One told
me, in particular, of a workman that made a ship,
with all its tackle, and masts, and sails, in earthen
ware, big enough to carry fty men. If he had
told me, he launched it, and made a voyage to
Japan in it, I might have said something to it
indeed; but, as it was, I knew the whole story,
which was, in short, asking pardon for the word,
that the fellow lyed. So I smiled, and said
nothing to it.
This odd sight kept me two hours behind the
caravan, for which the leader of it for the day
ned me about the value of three shillings; and told
me, if it had been three days’ journey without the
wall, as it was three days within, he must have
ned me four times“~as much, and-made me ask
pardon the next council-day; so I promised. to be
more orderly, for indeed‘I found axerwards the or-
ders ma-'de for keeping all together, -we're.-absolutely
necessary for our common safety. ~
In two days more we passed the great China
wall, made for a fortication against the Tartars;
and a very great work it is, going over hills and
mountains in an endless track,-where the rocks
are impassable, and the precipices such as no enemy
could possibly enter, or indeed climb up, or where,
if they did, no wallcould hinder them. They tell
us its length is near a thousand English miles, but
that the country is ve hundred in a straight mea-
sured line, which the wall bounds, withoutmeasuring
the windings‘ and turnings it takes: it is about
Your fathom high, and as many thick in some
places. -
I stood still an hour, or thereabout, without tres-
passing on our orders, for so long the caravan was
in passing the gate; I say, I stood still an hour to
look at it on every side, near and Far o°; I mean
what was within my view: and the guide of our
caravan, who had been extolling it for the wonder
of the world, was mighty eager to hear my opinion
of it. I told him it was a most excellent thing to
keep off the Tartars; which he happened not to un-
derstand as I meant it, and so took it for a compli-
ment: but the old pilot laughed; ‘ O seignior Ing-
lese,’ said he, ‘ you speak in colours.’ ‘ In co-
lours!’ said 1;‘ what do you mean by that?’ ‘ Why
you speak what looks white this way, and black that
way; gay one way, and dull another, way: you tell
him it is a good wall to keep o_ut Tartars ; you tell me
by that, it is good for nothing but tokeep out Tar-
tars; or, it will keep out none but Tartars. I under-
stand you, seignior Inglese, 1 understand you,’ said
he,joking; ‘ but seignior Chinese understand you
his own way.’ g
‘ Well,’ said I, ‘ seignior, do you think it would
st-and out an army of our country people, with a
good train of artillery; or our engineers, with -two
companies of miners? -Would they not batter it dow n
in ten days, that ,a:nariny.migh_tiente1) in ibattalia, or
blow it up into the air,{fot1ndation and all, that there
should be no sign of it left Z’ ‘ Aye, aye,‘ said he,
‘ I know that.’ The Chinese wanted mightily to
know what I-said, and I gave him leave to tell him
a few days after, for we were then almost out of
their country, and he was to leave us in a little
time afterwards; but when he knew what I had said,
he was dumb all, the rest of the way, and we heard
no more of his ne story of the Chinese power and
greatness while he staid.
- After we had passed this mighty nothing, called
a wall, something like the Picts’ wall, so famous in
Northumberland, and built by the Romans, we be-
gan to find the country thinly inhabited, and the
people rather conned to live in fortied towns and
cities, as being subject to the inroads and depreda-
tions of the Tartars, who rob in great armies, and
therefore are not to be resisted by the naked inha-
bitants of an open country. -
And here I began to nd the necessity of keeping
togetherin a caravan as we travelled; for we saw
several troops of Tartars roving about: but when I
came to see them distinctly, I wondered more that
the Chinc.se empire could be conquered by such
contcmptible fellows; for they are a mere herd, or
crowd, of wild fellows, keeping no order, and un-
derstanding no discipline or manner of ght.
Their -horses are poor, lean, starved creatures,
taught nothing, and are t for nothing; and this we
found the rst day we saw them, which was after we
entered the wilder part of the country. Our leader
for the day gave leave for about sixteen of us to go
a hunting, as they call it; and what was this but
hunting of sheep! However, it may be called hunt-
ing, too, for the creatures.are the wildest, and
swiftest of foot, that ever_I saw of their kind, only
they will not run a great way; and you are sure oi’
sport when you begin the chase-, for they appear
generally by thirty or forty in a ock, and, like true
sheep, always keep together when they y. ~
In pursuit = of this odd sort-of game, it was our
hap to meet with aboutforty Tartars: whether they
were hunting mutton, as wef were, or whether they
looked for anothefkindrof prey, I know not; but,
as soon as they saw us, one of them ‘blew a kind of
horn very loud, but witha barbarous sound that I
had never heard before, and, by the way, never care
to heareagain. We all supposed this was to call
their friends about them; and so it was: for in less
than half a quarter of an hour" a troop of forty or
fty more appeared, at about la mile distance; but
our work wasiovcr rst, as it happened.
One of the Se‘ots merchants of Moscow happened
to be amongst us; and as soon‘ as he heard the
horn he told us, in short, that we had nothing to
do but to charge them immediately, withoutloss of
time; and, drawing us up in a. line, he asked if we
were resolved? We told him we were ready to fol-
low him. So he rodo directly up to them. They
stood gazing at us like a mere crowd, drawn up in
no order, nor showing the face of any order at all ;
but as soon as they saw us advance, they let "y
their arrows, which, however, missed us, very hap-
pily. It seems they mistook not their aim, but
their distance; for their arrows all fella little short
of us, but with so truelan aim, that, had we been
about twenty yards nearer, we must have had sevea
ral men wounded, if not killed. -
Immediately w.e halted; and, though it was at a
great distance, we red, and sent them leaden bul~
lets for wooden arrows, following our shot full gal-
lop, resolving to fall in among them sword in hand,
for so our bold Scot that led us directed. He was,
indeed, but a ‘merchant, but he behaved with that
vigour and bravery on this occasion, and yet with
ouch ~a cool courage too, that I never saw any man
in action tter for command. As soon as we came
up to.th_em, we red our pistols in their faces, and
then drew; but they ed in the greatest confusion
imaginable: the only stand any of them made was
en our right, where three of them p stood, and lby
_@,,igns_calledp the rest to come back to them, having a
kind of scimitar in their hands, and their bows
hanging at their backs. Our brave commander,
without asking any body to follow him, galloped
up close to them, and with his fusilpknocked one of
them off his horse, killed the second with his pistol,
and the third ran away ; and thus ended our ght.
But we had this misfortune attending it, viz. that
all our mutton that we had in chase got away. We
had not a man killed or hurt; butas for the Tar-
;tars, there were about ve of them killed: how
many, were wounded we knew not; but this we
knew, that the other party was so _frightened, with
~.
the noise of our guns, that they ed, and never
made any attempt upon us. .
We were all this while in the Chinese do_mi_n_ion,
andthercfore the Tartars were not so bold as after-
wards; but in about ve days we entered a vast,
great, wild desert, which held us three days and
nights’ march; and we were obliged toscarry our
water with us in great leather bottles, and to en-
camp all night, just as I have heard they do in the
de__sert_s of Arabia. _ _
I asked our guides, whose dominion this was in?
and they told ‘me, this was ya kind ‘of border, that
might be called No _Man’sLandi; being a part of the
‘Great Karakathay, or Grand'17artary,; but that, how_-
ever, it was reckoned to China: that there was no
care taken hereito preseryc it from the inroads of
thieves, and. therefore it was reckoned the worst
desert in the whole march, though we were to go
over somemuch larger. _
~ In passing this wilderness, which, I confess, was at
the rst view very_frightful to me, we saw two or three
times, little parties of the Tartars, but they seemed
to be pen their own affairs, and to have no design
upon is}, aindisoi, like l.l]Gl1‘l<i1sldWltlO rnct the d0\ il, if
t’li%y had iiotliing to say to us, we had nothing to
say to théni, we let them go. C‘
Ohce, IIOWCVGII, a party of them came so near as
to étriiip zin ga c dt us ; whethei it was to consider
what tlieylsliotifd do,’viz. to attack us, or not attack
uis, we knew not, but when we had passed at some
distance by them, we made a rcai-guard of forty
men, and ‘stood ready for them, letting the caravan
pass half ii mile, or thereabouts, befoie us. After
a while they’ marched off, only we found they sa-
luted us with ve airews at their parting, one of
which wounded aliorse so that it disabled him, and
we left him the next day, poo: creature, in gieat
need of a good fairier we suppose they might
shoot more airows, which might fall short of us,
but we saw no more arrows or Tartars at that
time.
We travelled near a month aftei this, the ways
being not so good it ist, though still in the domi-
nions of the einpcior of China, but lay, for the most
part, in villages, seine of which weie foitificd be-
cause of the incuisioiis of the Tartars. When we
came to one of these towns (it was about trio days
and a half’s Journey before we were to come to the
city of Naum), I wanted to buy a camel, of which
tlieic are plenty to be sold all the way upon that
read, and of horses also, such as they axe, because
so many caravans coming that way, they are vei y
often wanted. The poison that I spoke to to get
me a camel would have gone and fetched it for me,
but I, like a fool, must be olcious, and go myself
along with him. The place was about two miles
out of the village, where, it seems, they kept the
camels and hoises feeding undu a guard.
I walked it on foot, with my old pilot in com-
pany, and a Cl]ll'1(.SG, being veiy desirous, forseoth,
ofalittle vaiiety When we came to this place, it
was a low, marshy ground, walled iound with a
stone wall, piled up dry, without mortar or earth
among it,.like a park, with a. little guard of Chinese
soldiers at the door. Having bought a camel, and
agreed for the price, I came away, and the Chinese
man that went with me_led the camel, when on a.
sudden came up ve Tartars on horseback; twoof
them seized the fellow, and took the camel from
him,.while the other three stepped. up to me and
my old pilot; seeing us, as it were, unarmed, for I
had no weapon about me but my sword, which
could but ill defend me against three horsemen.
The rst that came up stopped short upon my draw-
ing my sword (for they are arrant cowards), but a,
second coming upon my left, -gave me a blowron the
head, which I never felt till afterward, and won-
dered, when I came to myselt‘,what was the matter
with me, and where I was, for he laid me at on the
ground; but my never-failing old pilot, the Portu-
guese (so Providence, unlookechfor, directs deliver-
anccs from dangers, which to us are unforeseen),
had a pistol in his pocket, which 1 knew nothing of,
nor the Tartars neither; if they had, I suppose they
would not have attacked us. But. cowards are al.
ways boldest when there is. no danger.
The old man, seeing me-down, with at bold heart
stepped up to thefellow that had struck me, and,
laying hold of his arm with one hand, and pulling
him down by main force a little towards him with
the other, he shot him in the head, and laid him
dead on the spot; he then immediately stepped up
to him who had stopped us, as I said, and before he
could come forward again (for it was all done, as it
were, in a moment), -made a blow at him with a
sciinitar, which he always wore; but, missing the
man, cut his horse into the side of his head, cut one
of his ears off by the root, and a great slice down
the side of his face. The poor beast, enraged with
the wound, -was no,more to be governed by his rider,
though the fellow satwell enough too; but away he
ew, and carried him quite out of the pilot’s reach,
and at some distance, rising; upon his hind legs,
threw down the Tartar, and fell upon him.
In this interval the poor Chinese came in who
had lost the camel, but he had no weapon; how-
ever, seeingthe Tartaipdown, and his horse fallen
upon him, he runs to him, and seizing upon an ugly,
ill-favoured weapon he had by his side, something
like a pole-axe, ,but not a pole-axe neither, he
wrenched it from him, and made.shift to knock his
Tartarian brains out with it. But my old man had
the third Tartar to deal with still; and seeing he
did not y, as he expected, nor come on to ght
him, as he apprehended, but stood stock-still, the
old man stood still too, and falls to work with his
tackle to charge his pistol again; but as soon as the
Tartar saw the pistol, whether he supposed it.to be
the same or another I know not, but away he
scoured, and left my pilot (my champion I called
him afterwards) a complete victory.
. By this time I was a little awake, for I thought,
when I rst began to awake, that I had been in a
sweet sleep ; ~hnt, as I said above, I wondered where
I was, how I came upon the ground, and what was
the matter; in a word, a few moments after, as
sense returned, I felt pain, though I did not know
where: I clapped my hand to my head, and took
it away bloody, then I felt my head ache, and then,
in another moment, memory returned, and every
thing was present to me again. ,
I jumped up upon my feet instantly, and got hold
of my sword, but no enemies in view. I found a
Tartar lie dead, and his horse standing very quietly
by him; and, looking farther, I saw my champion
and deliverer, who had been to see what the
Chinese had done, coming back with his hanger in
his hand. lThe.old map, seeing me on my feet,
came running to me, and embraced mewith a great
deal of joy, being afraid before, that I had been
killed, and, seeing me bloody, would see how I was
hurt; but it was not much, only what we call a.
broken head; neither did Yafterwards nd any
great inconvenience from the blow,<b‘ther than the
place which was hurt‘, and which was"well’again in
two or three days. - -E -‘ " - ‘
We made no great gain, however,"'by this victory,
for we lost a camel and gained a horse: but that
which was remarkable, when we came back to-the
v_illage,' the man" demanded ‘to bepaid for the. camel.
1 disputed it, and it was brought to a hearing be-
fore the Chinese judge of the place, thaltisrto say, in
English, we went before a justice-of the peace.
Give him his due, he acted with a great deal of
prudence and impartiality, and, having heard both
sides, he gravely asked the Chinese man that went
with me to buy the camel, whose servant. he was.
‘ I am no servant,’ said he, ‘ but went with the
stranger.’ ‘At whose request?’ said the justice.
‘ At the strange-r’s request,’ said he. ‘ Why then,’
said the justice, ‘ you were the stranger's servant
for the time; and the camel being delivered to his
servant, it was delivered to him, and he must pay
for it.’ -
I confess the thing was so clear, that I had not
a word to say; but admiring to see such just rea-
soning upon the consequenee, and so accurate stat-
ing the case, 1 paid willingly for the camel, and
sent for another : but you may observe, I sent for
it; I did not go to fetch it myself any more. I had
enough of that.
The city of Naum is a frontier of the Chinese
empire. They callit fortied, and so it is, as forti-
cations go there, for this I will venture to airm,
that all the Tartars in Karakathay, which, I be-
lieve, are some millions, could not batter down
the walls with their bows and arrows; but to
call it strong, if it were attacked with cannon,
would be to make those who understand it, laugh
at you. g
We wanted, as I have said, above two days‘
j-ourney of this city, when messengers were sent
express to every -part of . the road, to tell all tra-
vellers and caravansi to halt, till they had a guard
sent to them, for that an-unusualbody-of Tartars,
making. ten thousand in all, had. appeared in the
way, about 'thi,rty1 miles beyond the ‘city.
This was-overly-badwnews-to tr'avel*l'ers: however,
it was carefully done.-‘of the governor, and‘ we were
very glad. to hear we=should ll-VG'i1"gl1'7lT'(l."' Ae-
eordi»ngly,.two daysafter, we hail two hundred sol-
diers sent us from a garrison of the Chinese, on
our left, and three hundred more of the city of
Naum, and with thosewe advanced boldly.) The
three hundred soldiers from Naum marched in our
front, the two hundred in our rear, and our men
on each side of our camels, with our baggage, and
the wholecaravan in the centre. In this order,
and well prepared for battle, we thought ourselves
a match for‘ the whole ten thousand Mogul Tar-
tars, if they had appeared; but the next day, when
they did appear, it was quite another thing.
It was early in the morning, when marching from
a little well-situated town, called Changu, we had»
a river to pass, where we were obliged to ferry, and
had the Tartars had an -intelligence, then had been
the time to have attacked us, when the caravan
being over, the rear guard was behind; but they
did not appear there. ' i
About three hours after, when we were entered
upon a. desert of about fteen or sixteen miles
over, behold, by a cloud of dust they raised, we
saw an enemy was at hand: and they were at hand
indeed, for they came ‘on upon the spur. »
The Chinese, our guard on the front, who had
talked so big the day before, began to stagger, and
the soldiers frequently looked behind them, which
is a certain sign in a soldier, that he is just ready
to run away. My old pilot was of my mind, and,
being near me, he called out, ‘ Seignior Inglese,-’
said he, those fellows must be encouraged, or they
will ruin-us all 3 for if the Tartars some “on, they
will never stand it.? ‘*1 am of your mind,’ said I ;
* but what course must be done?’ ‘ Done!’ said
he. ‘ Let fty of our_- men advance, and sankthem
on each wing, and encourage them,» ands they -will
ghtilike brave fellows» in-brave company; but
without it, they will-every man turn his ‘back. Im-
m_ed_iately; I rode up to_..e.ur leader, and-told ihim,
who was exactly of our mind ; and accordingly fty
of us marched to the. right wing, and ,fty.to the
left, and the rest made~a».li-ne of reserve: and so
we -marched, leaving the last two -hundred men to
make another body by themselves, and togua-rd the
camels, only that, if need were, they-should send a
hundred men to assist‘ the last fty; 1 .
. In a word, the Tartars came on,’ and an innu-
merable company they were :;»-hows many, wecould
not tell; but ten thousand we thought was the
least. A party of them ‘came on rst, nhd'viewed
our posture, travcrsingthe ground 'in~the-- front of
our line; and as awe found them within gun-shot,
our leader ordered the two wings to advance
swiftly, and give them a salvo on each wing with
their shot, which was done; ,but they went eff, and,
I suppose, went back to give an account of the
reception.-they were like to meet with: and in-
deed thatsalute clogged their stomachs, for they
immediately haltcd,.stood ta while to consider of
it,.and, wheeling oil’ to the left, they gave over the
dcsig_ir,- and said‘ not more to us for that time,
which was very agreeable’ to ouricircumstances,
which were -but very.indi’erent for a battle with
such anumberaq ‘ - -
Twoi-days after this, we came to the city of
Naunm, or Naum. 1 We thankedv the governor for
his care for us, and collected to the valueof one
hundred crowns, or Lhereabouts, which we gave to
the soldiers sent to guard-us ; and here we rested
one day. This is a garrison indeed, and there
were nine hundred soldiers kept here; but the
reason of it was, that formerly the Muscovite
frontiers lay nearer to them than they do now, the
Muscovites having abandoned that part of the
country (which lies from this city west, for about
two hundred-miles) as desolate, and unt for use:
and more especially, being so very remote, and so
ditlieul-t to-send troops thither for its defence, for
we had yet above two thousand miles to Muscovy,
properly so cal-led._ "
After this we passed several great rivers, and
two dreadful deserts, one of which we were sixteen
days passing over, and which, as I said, was to be
called ‘ No Man's Land;’ and on the thirteenth
of April we came to the frontiers of the Moscovite
dominions. I think the rst city, or town, or for-
tress, whatever it might be called, that belonged to
the czar of Muscovy, was called Argun, being on the
west side of the river Argun.
I could not but discover an innite satisfaction,
that I was now arrived in, as I called it, a Chris-
tian country, or, at least, in a country governed by
Christians; for though the Moscovites do, in my
opinion, but just deserve the name of Christians,yet
such they pretend to be, and are very devout in
their way. It would certainly occur to any man
who travels the world as I have done, and who
had any, power of reection, I say, it would occur
to him, to reflect what a blessing it is to be brought
into the world where the name of God, and of a
Redeemer, is known, worshipped and adored; and
not where the people, given up by Heaven to strong
delusions, worship the devil, and prostrate them-
selves to stocks and stones, worship monsters, ele-
ments, horrible shaped animals, and statues, or
images of monsters. Not a town, or city, we pass-
ed through, but had their pagoda, their idols, and
their temples, and ignorant people worshipping oven
the works of their own hands. -
New we came where, at least, the face of the
Christian-worship appeared, where the knee was
bowed to Jesus; and whether ignorantly or not,
yet the Christian religion was owned, and the name
of the true God was called upon and adored: and
it made the very recesses o-f my soul rejoice to see
it. I saluted the brave Scots merchant I men-
tioned above, with my rst acknowledgement of
this, and, taking him by'the liand-, I said-to him,
‘Blessed be God, we are o'nce"ag-ain come among
Christians!’ He smiled, and answered, ¢ Do not
rejoice too soon, countryman; these Muscovites are
but an odd sort of Christians, and but-for the name
of it, you mayisee very little of the substance for
some months farther of our journey.’
‘ Well,’ said I, ‘ but still it is better than pagan-
ism, and worshipping of devils.’ " Why, 1’ll tell
you,’ said he: ‘ except‘ the Russian soldiers in gar-
risons, and a few of the inhabitants of the cities
upon the road, all the rest of this country, for
abeve a thousand miles farther, is inhabited by the
worst and most ignorant of pagans; and so indeed
we found it.’
We were now launched into the greatest piece of
solid earth, if I understand any thing of the surface
of the globe, that is to be found in any part of the
world. We had, at least, twelve hundred miles to
the sea, eastward: we had, at least, two thousand
to the bottom of the Baltic Sea, westward; and
almost three thousand miles, if we left that sea, and
went on west to the British and French Channels ;
we had full ve thousand miles to the Indian or
Persian Sea, south ; and about eight hundred miles
to the Frozen Sea, north. Nay, if some people may
be believed, there might be no sea, north-east, till
we came round the pole, and, consequently, into
the no_rth-west, and so had a continent of land into
America, no mortal knows where ; though I could
give some reasons why I believe that to be a mis-
take too. ~
As we entered into the Muscovite dominions, a
good while before we came to any considerable
town, we had nothing to observe there but this;
/
rst, thatfall the.-rivers run to the east. As I un-
derstood by the charts, which some of -our caravans
had withthern, it was "plain that all those rivers ran
into the- great river Ynrnour, or Gammour. This
river," by the natural course-of-it, must run into the
east son; or-;Chinese'ocean. ‘T he story they=tell us,
that the mouth of this river is choaked up with bul-
rushes ofsmmenstrouls growth, viz. three feet about,
and twenty or thi-Ptyr feet high, I must be allowed
to. say, ‘I believe nothing of. But as its navigation
is of no use, because there is no tradethat way,
the Tartars, to whom it alone belongs, dealing in
nothing but cattle, so nobody, that ever I heard of,
has been curious enough either to go down to the
-mouth of it in boats, or come up from the mouthof
it in ships: but this is certain, that this river run-
ning due east, in the latitude of sixty degrees, car-
ries. a vast concourse of rivers along with it, and
nds an ocean to empty itself in that latitude: so
we are sure of sea there.
Some leagues to the north of this river there are
several considerable rivers, whose streams run as
due north as the Yamour runs east; and these are
all found to join their waters with the great river
Tartarus, named so from the northernmost nations
of the‘~Mogul Tartars, who, the Chinese say, were
the rst Tartars in the world, and who, as our geo~
graphers allege, are the Gog and Magog mentioned
in sacred story. . i
- ,'I'he'se riversrunning all northward, as well as all
the other rivers I am yet to speak of, make it evi-
dent, that the northern ocean bounds the land also
on that side; so that it does notseem rational in the
least to think, that the-land can extend itself to join
with America,on that side, or that there is not a
communication between the northern and the ’east-
ern ocean; but of this I shall say no more: it was
my observation at that time, and therefore I take
notice of it in this place. We now advanced from
the river Arguna, by easy and moderate journeys.

days to travel over it. In a village, near the last
of those places, I had the curiosity to go andsee
their way of living, which is most brutish and un-
suiierable. They had, I suppose, a great sacrice
that day; for there stood out, upon an old stump
of a tree, anidol, made of wood, frightful as the
devil, at least as any thing we can think of to rc-
preseut the devil, can be made: it had a head cer-
tainly not so much as resembling any creature that
the world ever saw; ears as big as goats’ horns,
and as high ; eyes as big as a crown-piece; a nose
like a crooked ram’s horn, and a mouth extended
four-cornered, like that of e lion, with horrible
teeth, hooked like a par:-ot's under bill’. 1t was
dressed up in the lthiest manner that you can sup»
pose: its upper garment was of sheep-skins, with
the wool outward; a great Tartar bonnet on the.‘

head, with ‘two horns ‘growing through it. It was
about eight feet high; yet -had no feet, or legs, or
any other proportion of parts.
Tliis'.sczirecrow; was set up at the outside of the
village, and when I came near to it, there -were six-
teen or seventeen creatures, whether men or women
I could not tell, for they make no distinction by
their habits, either of body or head: these lay all
at on the ground, round this formidable block of
shapeless wood. I saw no motion among them, any
more thanif they had been logs of wood, like their
idol. At iirst, I really thought they had been so;
but when L came a little nearer, they started up
upon their feet, and raised _a howling cry,‘ as if it
llad bccnso many deep-mouthed hounds, and walk-
ed away as it they were displeased'at- our disturb-
ing them. A little way o‘ from this monster, and
at the door of a tent, or hut, made all ofshecp.
skins‘ and cow-skins dried, stood-three butchers.
I thought they were such; for when I came nearer
to them, 1 found they had long knives in their
hands, and in the middle of the tent appeared
three sheep, killed, and one young bulloclt, or steer.
These, it seems, were sacrices to that senseless
log of an idol, and the-so three men priests, belong-
ing to it; and the seventeen pros-tratcd wretches
were the people who brought the oliiering, and were
making their prayers to that stock. .
‘ I lconiess I was more moved at their stupidity,
and this brutish worship of a hobgoblin, than ever
I was at any thing in my life: to see (,'rot'l’s most
glorious and bestereature, to whom he had gr-.»uited
so many advantages, even by creation, above the
rest of the works of his hands, vested with a ren-
sonable soul,'and that soul atlorned with faculties
and capacities ntiitpttrtl both to honour his Maker,
and be lronoured by him; I say, to see it sunk
and degenerated to a degree so more than stupid,
as to prostrate itself to a frightful nothing, a more
imaginary object, dressed up by themselves, and
made terrible to themsi-lves by their own contrivance,
adorned only with't-louts and rags, and that this
should be the eifeet of mere ignorance, wrought up
into hellrish devotion by the devil himself,-who,
cnvying to his Maker the homage and adoration
of his creatures, had deluded them into such gross
surfciting, sordid, and brutish things, as one would
think should shock nature itself. -
But what signied all the astonishment and re.
eetion of thoughts? Thus it was, and I saw it be-
fore my eyes; and there was no room to wonder
at it, or think it impossible. All my admiration
turned to rage, and 1 rode up to the image, or mon-
ster, call it ivhat-you will, and, with my sword,
cut the bonnet that was on its head in two, in the
middle-, so that it hung down by one of the horns;
and one ol’ our men that was \vith me took hold of
the sheep-skin that eov(~red it. and pulled at it,
wlien, behold, a most hideous outcry and howling
ran through the village, and two or three hundred
pt-opl_e came about my ears, so that l was glad to
scour for it, for we saw some had bows and ar-
rows: but I resolved, froin that moment, to visit
them gzlill.
. Our caravan rested three nights at the town,
which was about Four miles oil’, in order to provide
some horses which they wanted, several of tho
horses having been lamed and jaded with the bad~
ness of the way, and our long march over the last
desert ;f so we had some leisure here to put my de-
sign in execution. I eonununieated my project to
the Scots m<-rchant oi’; Moscow, 01' whose courage I
had had sullicieut testimony, as above. l told him
What l had seen, and with what indignationl had
since thought that human nature could be so dege-
nerate. l told him, 1 was resolved, if 1 could but
get four or ve men, well armed, to go with me, to
go and destroy that vile, abominable idol; to let
them see that it had no power to help itself’, and
consequently could not be an object of worship, or
to be prayed to, much less .help them that offered
sacrices to it. I
I-Ie laughed at me. Said he, ‘ Your zeal may be
good; but what do you propose to yourself by it P’
‘ Propose!’ said I: ‘ to vindicate the honour of
God, which is insulted by this devil~worship.’ ‘ But
how will it vindicate the honour of God,’ said he,
‘ while the people will not be able to know what
you mean by it, unless you could speak to them
too, and tell them so. And then they will ght
you too, l’ll assure you, for they are desperate fel-
lows, and that especially in defence of their idola-
try.’ ‘ Can we not,’ said I, ‘ do it in the night, and
then leave them the reasons in writing, in their
own language?’ ‘ Writing!’ said he: ‘ why there
is not in ve nations of them, one man that knows
any thing of a letter, or how to read a word in any
language, even in their own.’ ‘ Wretched igno-
rance !’ said I to him. ‘ However, I have a great
mind to do it: perhaps nature may draw inferences
from it to them, to let them see how brutish they
are to worship such horrid things.’ ‘ Look you,
sir,’ said he, ‘ if your zeal prompts you to it so
warmly, you must do it; but, in the next place, I
would have you consider, these wild nations of
people are subjected by force to the czar of Mus-
covy’s dominions; and if you do this, it is ten to
one but they will come by thousands to the gover-
nor of Nortzinskoy, and complain, and demand sa-
tisfaction, and if he cannot give them sati.~ fllCLlOl1,
it is ten to one but they will revolt, and it will
occasion a new war with all the Tartars in the
country.
This, I confess, put new thoughts into my head
for a while; but I harped upon the same string still,
and all that day I was uneasy to put my project in
execution. Towards the evening the Scots mer-
chant met me by accident in our walk about the
town, and desired to speak with me. ‘I believe,’
said he, ‘ I have put you oi? of your good design :‘
I have been a little concerned about it since, for I
abhor the idol and idolatry, as much as you can
do.’ -‘ Truly,’ said I, ‘you have put me off a little
as to the execution of it, but you have not put it
all out of my thoughts, and, I believe, 1 shall do it
still before I quit this place, though I were to be
delivered up to them for satisfaction.’ ‘ No, no,’
said he; ‘ God forbid they should deliver you up
to such a crew of monsters: they shall not do that
neither; that would be murdering you indeed.’
‘ Why,’ said I, ‘ how would they use me?’ ‘ Use
you!’ said he. ‘I'll tell you how they served a
poor Russian, who aifronted them in their worship
just as you did, and whom they took prisoner.
After they had lamed him with an arrow, that he
could not run away, they took him, and stripped
him stark naked, and set him upon the top of the
idol-monster, and stood all round him, and shot as
many arrows into him as would stick over his whole
body; and then they burned him, and all the ar-
rows sticking in him, as a sacrice to the idol.’
‘And was this the same idol?’ said I. ‘ Yes,’ said
he, ‘ the ‘very same.’ " Well,’ said I, ‘ 1’ll tell you
a story.’ So I related the story of our men at
Madagascar, and how they burned and sacked the
village there, and killed man, woman, and child,
for their murdering one of our men, just as it is
related before; and when I had done, I added,
that I thought we ought to do so to this village.
Ile listened very attentively to the story; but
when I talked of doing so to that village, said he,
‘ You mistake very much; it was not this village, it
was almost a hundred miles from this place ; but it
was the same idol, for they carry him about in
procession all over the country.’ ‘ Well,’ said I,
‘ then that idol ought to be punished for it; and it
shall,’ said I, ‘ if I live this night out.’ ~
In a word, nding me resolute, he liked the de-
sign, and told me I should not go alone, but he
would go with me: but he would go first, and bring
21 stout fellow, one of his conntry_me_n, to go also
with us; ‘ And one,’ said he, ‘ as Famous for his
zeal as you can desire any one to be, against such
devilish things as these.’ ln a word, he brought
me his comrade, a. Scotsman, whom he called cap-
tain Richardson, and 1 gave hini a full account of
what I had seen, and also of what I intended; and
he told me readily he would go witlrinc-.,»it‘ it cost
him his life. So we agreed to go, only we three. I
had indeed proposed it to my partner, but he dc.-
clined it. He said he was ready to assist me to the
utmost, and upon all occasions. for my defence; but
that this was an adventure quite out ol’ his way: so,
I’ say, we resolved upon our work, only we three,
and my man-servant, and to put it in execution
that night about midnight, with all the secrecy ima~
ginalrle.
However, upon second thoughts, we were willing
to delay it till the next niizht, because, the caravan
being to set forward in the morning, we supposed
the governor could not pretend to give them any
satisfaction upon us when we were out of his power.
The Scots merchant. as steady in his resolution for
an enterprise as bold in executing it, brought me a.
Tartar’s robe, or gown of Si\(‘(‘P"Si(lHS, and a bon-
net, with at b_0w and arrows, and had provided the
same for himself and his countryman, that the peo-
ple, if they saw us, should not be able to determine
who we were.
All the rst night we spent in mixing up some
combustible matter with aquavitze, gunpowder, and
such other materials as we could get; and, hav-"
ing a good quantity of tar in a little pot, about
an hour after night, we set out upon our expe-
dition. V
We came to the placeabout eleven o’clock at
night, and found that the people had not the least
jealousy of danger attending their idol. The night
was cloudy, yet the moon gave us light ‘enough to
see that the idol stood just in ,tbe same posture
\
and place that it did before. The people seemed
to be all at their rest, only that in the great hut, or
tent, as we called it, where we saw the three
priests, whom we mistook for butchers, we saw a
light; and, going up close to the door, we heard
people talking, as if there were ve or six of them.
We concluded, therefore, that if we set wildre to
the idol, these men would come out immeditttely,
and runoup to the place to rescue it from the de-
struction that we intended for it: and what to do
with them we knew not. Once we thought of car-
rying it away, and setting re to it at a distance;
but \\ hen we came to handle it, we found it too
bulky for our carriage: so we were at a loss
again. The second Scotsman was for setting re to
the tent, or hut, and knocking the creatures that
were there on the head when they came out : but
I could. not join with that; 1 was against killing
them, ii’ it was possible to be avoided; ‘ Well,
then,‘ said the Scots merchant, ‘ I’ll tell you what
we will do: we will try to take them pl‘iSOI16I‘,
tie their hands, and make them stand still and see
their idol. destroyed. ’
As it happened we had twine or paekthread
enough about us, which was used to tie our re.
works together with: so we resolved to attack
the'se people rst, and with as little noise as we
could. The rst thing we did, we knocked at the
door, when one oi’ the priests coming to the door,
we immediately seized upon him, stopped his mouth‘,
and tied his hands behind him, and led him to the
idol, where we gagged him, that he might not make
a noise: we tied his feet also together, and left
him on the ground. . ;
. Two ol’ us then waited at the door, expecting
that another would come out to see what the mat-
-ter was ; but we waited so long till the third man
came back to us; and then, nobody coming out, we
knocked again gently, and immediately out came
two.more, and we served tliem just in the same
manner, but were obliged to go all with them, and
lziy them down by the idol some distance from one
-another, when going back, we found two more were
come, out to the door, and a third stood behind
them within the door. We seized the two, and im-
mediately tied them, when the third stepping back,
and crying out, my Scots merchant went in after
him, and taking out acomposition we had made,
that would only smoke and stink, he set re to it,
and threw it in among them". By that time the
other Scotsman, and my man, taking charge of the
two men already bound, and tied together also by
the arm, led them away to the idol, and left them
there, to see if their idol would relieve them, mak-
ing haste back to us. ' 1
When the fuze we had thrown in had lled the
hut with so much smoke that they were almost suf-
focated, we then threw in a small leather bag of
another kind, which amed like a candle, and fol-
lowing it in, we found there were but four people
left, who, it seems, were two men and two wo-
men, and, as we supposed, had been about some of
their diabolic sacrices. They appeared, in short,
frighted to death, at least so as to sit trembling
and stupid, and not able to speak neither, for the
smoke.
In a word, we took them, bound them as we had
the others, and all without any noise. I should
have said, we brought them out of the house, or
hut, rst; for indeed we were not able to bear the
smoke, any more than they were. When we had
done this, we carried them all together to the idol.
When we came there we fell to work with him;
and, rst, we daubed him all over, and his robes
also, with tar, and such other stuff as we had,
which was tallow mixed with brimstone; then we
stopped his eyes, and ears, and mouth, full of gun.
powder; then we wrapped up a great piece of
wildre in his bonnet; and then sticking all the
eombustibles we had brought with us upon him,
we looked about to see if wecould nd any thing
else to help to -btirn,him, when my man remem-
bered that by the tent, or hut, where the men
were, there lay a heap of dry forage, whether straw
or rushes I do not rememberuaway he" and one
of the Scotsmen ran, and fetched their arms full of
that. When we had done this, we took all our
prisoners, and brought them, having untied their
feet, and ungagged '.heir mouths, and made them
stand up, and set them just before their monstrous
idol, and then set re to the whole. ~ '
We staid by it a quarter ofa hour, or thereabouts,
till the powder in the eyes, and mouth, and ears of
the idol blew up, and, as we could perceive, had
split and deformed the shape of it: and, in a word,
till we saw it burn into a mere block or log of wood;
and. then setting the dry forage to it, we found it
would be soon quite consumed, so we l>e_gan to
think of going away : but the Scotsman said, ‘ No,
we must not go, for these poor, deluded wretches
will all throw themselves into the tire, and burn
themselves with the idol.’ So we resolved to stay
till the forage was burned down too, and then we
came away, and left them.
In the morning we appeared among our fellow-
travellers, exceeding busy in getting ready for our
j~ourney: nor could any man suggest that we had
been any where butin our beds, as travellers might
be supposed to be, to lit themselves for the fatigues
of that day?s journey. v '
But it did not cud so; for the next day came a
great multitude of the country people, not only of
this village, but of -a hundred more, for aught I
know-, to the town gates, and, in a most outrageous
manner, demanded satisfaction of the Russian go-’
vernor, for the insulting their priests, and burning
their great Chain-Chi-Thaungu, such a hard name
they gave the monstrous ,creature- they worship-
ped. The people of .Nortzinsl<oy were at rst in
a, great consternation; for they said tl1e.'1‘art'.-uts
. ‘J D Q
\
were no less than thirty thousand, and that, in a few
days more, they would be one hundred thousand
strong. ’
The Russian governor sent out messengers to
appeasevthem, and gave them all the good words
imaginable. He assured them he knew nothing of’
it, and that there had not a soul of his garrison
been abroad; that it could not be from any body
there; and if they would let him know who it was,
they should be exemplarily punished. They re-
turned, haughtily, that all theicountry reverenced
the great Cham-Chi-Thaungu, who dwelt in the
sun, and no mortal would have~ dared to olier
violence to his image, but some Christian mis-
creants, so they called them, it seems; and they
therefore denounced war against him and all the
Russians, who, they said, were miscreants and
Christians.
' The governor, still patient, and unwilling to make.
a breach, or to have any cause of war alleged to
be given by him, the czar having strictly charged
him to treat the conquered country with gentle-
ness and civility, gave them still all the good words
he could: at last, he told them, there was a caravan
gone towards Russia that morning, and, perhaps, it
was some of them who had done them this injury,
and that, if they would be satised with that, he
would send after them, to inquire into it. This
seemed to appease them a little, and accordingly the
governor sent after us, and gave us a particular
account how the thing was, intimating withal, that
if any in our caravan had done it, they should
make their escape; but that, whether they had
done it or no, we should make all the haste for-
ward that was possible; and that, in the mean
time, he would keep them in play as long as he
could.
This was very friendly in the governor. How-
ever, when it cameto the caravan, there was nobody
knew any thing of the matter; and, as for us that
were guilty, we were the least of all suspected:
none so much as asked us the question. However,
the captain of the caravan for the time, took the
hint that the governor gave us, and we marched, or
travelled two days and two nights, without any
considerable stop, and then we lay at a village
called Plothus; nor did we make any long stop
here, but hastened on towards Jarawena, another
of the czar of ‘Muscovy’s colonies, and where we
expected we should be safe. But it is to be ob-
served that here we began, for two or three days’
march, to enter upon a vast, nameless desert, of
which I shall say more in its place, and which if
we had now been upon, it is more than probable
we had been all destroyed. It was the second day‘s
march from Plothus, that, by the clouds of dust
behind us, at a great distance, some of our people
began to be sensible we were pursued. We had en-
tered the desert, and had passed by a great lake,
called Schaks Oser, when we perceived a very great
body of horse appear on the other side of the lake
to the north, we travelling west. We observed
they went away west as we did,»bnt had supposed
we would have taken that side of the lake, whereas
we very happily took the south side; and, in two
days more, we saw them not, for they, believing we
were still before them, pushed on, till they came to
the river Udda: this is a very great river when it
passes farther north ; but where we came to it, we
found it narrow and fordable.
Tlie third day they either found their mistake or
had intelligence of us, and came pouring in upon
us, towards the dusk of the evening. We had, to
our great satisfaction, just pitched upon a place for
our camp, which was very convenient for the night;
for as we were upon a desert, though but at the
beginning of it, that was above ve hundred miles
over, we had no towns to lodge at, and indeed ex-
pected none but the city of Jarawena, which we
had yet two days’ march to. The desert, how-
ever, ,h-ad some few woods in it on this side, and
little rivers, which ran all into the great river
Udda. lt was in a narrow strait, between two small,
but very thick woods, that we pitched our little
camprfor that nig-ht, expecting to be attacked in
the night. _
Nobody knew. but ourselves, what we were-pur.
sued for; but as it was usual for the Mogul Tartars
to go about in troops in that desert, so the caravans
always fortify themselves every night against them,
as against armies of ‘robbers; and it was therefore
no new thing to be pursued. ¢
But we had this night, of all the nights of our
travels, a most advantageous camp ; for we lay he-
tween two woods, with a little rivulet running
just before our front; so that we could not be
surrounded or attacked any way, but in our front
or rear. We took care also to make our front as
strong as we could, by placing our packs, with
our camels and horses, all in a line on the inside
of the river; and we felled some trees in our rear. I
In this posture, we encamped for the night; but
the enemy was upon us, before we had nished our
situation. They did not come on us like thieves,
as we expected; but sent three messengers to us,
to demand the men to be delivered to them that
had. abused their priests, and burned their god
Gham-Chi-'l‘haungu, that they might burn them
with re: and upon this, they said, they would go
away, and do us no further harm, otherwise they
would burn us all with re. Our men looked very
blank at this message, and began to stare at one
another, to see who looked with most guilt in their
faces; but, ‘ nobody’ was the word, nobody did it.
The leader of the caravan sent word, he was well
assured it was not done by any of our camp; that
we were peaceable merchants, travelling on our
business; that we had done no harm to them, or
to any one else; and that therefore they must look
farther for their enemies who had injured them-,
for we were not the -people ; so desired them not
to disturb us, for if they did we should defend our-
selves. ' . .
They were far from being satised with this for
an answer, and a great crowd of them came down
in the morning, by break of day, to our camp; but
seeing us in such an advantageous situation, they
durst come no‘ farther than-the brook in our front,
where they stood, and showed us such a number as
indeed terried us very much; for those that
spoke least of them spoke often thousand. 1-Iere
they stood, and looked at us a while, and then set-
ting up a. great howl, they let y a cloud of ar-
rows among us: but we were well enough forti-
fied for-that, for we sheltered under our baggage;
and I do not remember that one man of us was
hurt. - _ e
Some time after this, we saw them move a little
to our right, and expected them on the rear; when
a cunning fellow, a Cossack, as they call them, of
Jarawena, in the pay of the Muscovites, calling to
the leader of the caravan, said to him, ‘ I’ll go send
all these people away to Sib_eilka.’_ This was a city
four or ve days’ journey, at least, to the south, and
rather behind us. So he takes his bow and arrows,
and getting on horseback, he rides away from our
rear directly, as it were, back to Nortzinskoy : after
this, he takes a great circuit about, and comes to
the army of the Tartars, as if he had been sent
express to tell them a long story, that the people
who had bu_rned their Cham-Chi-Thaungu were
gone to Sll)Glll(3,‘Wll.ll a caravan of miscreants, as
he called them, that is to say, Christians; and that
they were resolved to burn the god Schal-Isar, be~_
longing to the Tongueses.
. As this fellow was a mere Tartar, and perfectly
spoke their language, he counterfeited so well, that
they all took it from him, and away they drove, in
a most violent hurry, to Sibeilka, which, it seems,
was almost ve days’ journey to the south, and in
l .i
less than three hours they were entirely out of our
sight, and we never heard any more of them, nor
ever knew whether they went to that other place
called Sibeilka, or no.
So we passed safely on to the city of Jerawena,
where there was a garrison of Muscovites ; and
there we rested ve days, the caravan being ex-
ceedingly fatigued with the last day's march, and
with want of rest in the night.
From this city we had a frightful desert, which
held us three-and-twenty days’ march. We fur-
nished ourselves with some tents here, for the bet.
ter accommodating ourselves in the night; and the
leader of the caravan procured sixteen carriages,
or waggons, of the country, for carrying our water
and provisions; and these carriages were our de-
fence every night round our little camp: so that
had the Tartars appeared, unless they had__ been
very numerous indeed, they would not have been
able to hurt us. ’ 4
We may well be supposed to want rest again
after this long journey, for in this desert we saw
neither house nor tree, nor scarce a bush. We saw in-
deed abundance of the sable hunters, as they called
them ; these are all Tartars, of the Mogul Tartary,
of which this country is a‘ part, and they frequently
attack small ca-ravans ; but we saw no numbers of
them together. I was curious to see the sable-
skins they catched, but I could never speak with
them, for they durst not come near us, neither
durst we straggle from our company to go near
them.
After we had passed this desert, we came into a
country pretty well inhabited, that is to say, we
found towns and castles settled by the czar of Mus.
co.vy, with garrisons of stationary soldiers to pro-
tect the caravans, and defend the country against
the Tartars, who would otherwise make it very
dangerous travelling; and his czarish majesty has
given such strict orders for the well guarding the
caravans and merchants, that if there are any Tar.
tars heard of in the country, detachments of the
garrison are always sent to see travellers safe from
station to station.
And thus the governor of Adinskoy, whom I had
opportunity to make a visit to, by means of the
Scots merchant, who was acquainted with him, of-
fered us a guard of fty men, if we thought there
was any danger, to the next station.
I thought, long before this, that as we came nearer
to Europe, we should nd the country better peo-
pled, and the people more civilized; but I found
myself mistaken in both ; for we had yet the nation
of the Tongueses to pass through, where we saw
the same tokens of paganism and barharity, or
worse than before; only as they were conquered
by the Muscovites, and entirely reduced, they were
not so dangerous: but for rudeness of manners,
idolatry, and polytheism, no people in the world
ever went beyond them. They are clothed all in
skins of beasts, and their houses are built of the
same. You know notaman from a woman, neither
by the ruggedness of their countenances, nor their
clothes ; and in winter, when the ground is covered
with snow, they live under ground, in houses like
vaults, which have cavities, or caves, going from
one to another. .
If the Tartars had their Cham-Chi-Tlfaungu for
a whole village or country, these had idols in
every hut and every cave: besides, they worship
the stars, the sun, the water, the snow, and, in
a word, every thing that they do not understand,
and they understand but very little; so that almost
every element, every uncommon thing, sets them a.
sacricing.
Butl am no more to describe people than coun-
tries, any farthcr than my own story comes to be
concerned in them. I met with nothing peculiar to
myself in all this country, which, I reckon, was
from the desert which I spoke of last, at least four
hundred miles, half of it being another desert,
which took us up twelve days’ severe travelling,
withouthouse, tree, or bush ; but we were obliged
again to carry our own provisions, as well water as
bread. After we were out of this desert, and had
travelled two days, we came to Janezay, a Mus-
covite city or station, on the great river Janezay.
This river, they told us, parted Europe from Asia,
though our map-makers, as I am told, do not
agree to it. I-Iowevier, it is certainly the eastern
boundary of the ancient Siberia, which now makes a‘
province only of thevast Muscovite empire, but is
itself equal in bigness to the -whole empire of
Germany.’ -
~ And yet here I observed ignorance and paganism
still prevailed,‘ except in the Muscovite garrisons:
all the country between the river Oby and the river
Janezay, is as entirely pagan, and the people as
barbarous, as the remotcst of the Tartars; nay, as
any nation, for aught I know, in Asia or America.
I also found, which I observed to the Muscovite
governors whom I had opportunity to converse
with, that the pagans are not much the wiser, or
the nearer Christianity, for being under the Mus-
covite government; which they acknowledged was
true enough: but they said it was none of their
business: that if the czar expected to convert his
Siberian, or Tonguese, or Tartar subjects, it should
be done by sending clergymen among them, not
soldiers; and they added, with more sincerity than
I expected, that they found it wasnot so much the
concern of their monarch to make the people Chris-
tians, as it was to make them subjects.
. From this river to the great river Oby, we crossed
a wild, uncultivated country: I cannot say, it is
a~ barren soil, it _is only barren of people, and
good management; otherwise it is in itself a most
pleasant, fruitful, and ag1'eeaI>le country. What in-
habitants we found in it are all pagans, except
such as are sent among them from Russia; for
this is the country, I mean on both sides the river
Oby, whither the Muscovite criminals that are
not put to death are banished, and from whence
it is next to impossible they should ever come
away.
I have nothing material to say of my particular
affairs, till I came to Tobolski, the capital city of
_Siberia, where I continued some time, on the fol-
lowing occasion.
We had been now almost seven months on our
journey, and winter began to come” on apace;
whereuponmy partner and I called-a council about
our particular affairs, in which we found it proper,
considering that we were bound for England, and
not for Moscow, to consider how to dispose of
ourselves. They told us of sledges and rein-deer
to carry us over the snow in the-winter time;
and indeed they have such things as it would be
incredible to relate the particulars of, by which
means the Russians travel morejn the winter than
they can in summer; because in these sleds they
are able to run night and day; the snow, being
frozen, is one universal covering to nature, by
which the hills and vales, the rivers, the lakes, are
all smooth, and hard as a stone; and they run
upon the surface, without any regard to what is
underneath.
But I had no occasion to push at a winter jour.
ney of this kind; I was bound to England, not to
Moscow, and my route lay two ways: either I must
go on as the caravan went, till I came to Jeroslow,
and then go o’ west for Narva, and the gulf of
Finland, and so either by sea or land to Dantzic,
where I might possibly sell my China cargo to good
advantage; or I must leave the caravan at a little
town on the Dwina, from whence I had but six
days, by water, to Archangel, and from thence
might be sure of shipping, either to England, Hol.
land, or I-Ia1:nburgh._
Now to go any of these journeys in the winter
would have been preposterous; for, as to Dantzic,
the Baltic would be frozen up, and I could not get
passage, and to go up by land in those countries,
was far less safe than among the Mogul Tartars:
likewise to go to Archangel in October, all the ships
would be gone from thence, and even the mer-
chants, who dwell thcre in summer, retire south to
Moscow in the winter, when the ships are gone;
so that I should have nothing but extremity of
euld to encounter, with a scarcity of provisions,
and must lie there in an empty town all the win-
ter. S0 that, upon the whole,-I thought it much
my better way, to’let thecaravan go, and to make
provision to winter where I was, viz. at Tobolski,
in Siberia, in the latitude of sixty degrees, w,here I
was sure of three things to wear out a cold winter
with, viz. plenty of provision, such as the country
afforded, a warm house, with fuel enough, and.ex.-
cellent company: of all which I shall give a full
account in its place. '
I was now-in a quite different climate from my
beloved island, where 1 never felt cold, except
when I had‘Tny ague; on the contrary, I had much
to do to bear any clothes on my back, and
never made any re but without doors, and for
my necessity, in dressing my food, &c. Now I
made me three good vests, with large robes on
gowns over them, to hang down to the feet, and
button close to the wrists, and all these lined with
furs, to make them sufficiently warm.
As to a warm house, I must confess, I greatly
dislike our way in England, ofmaking res in every
room in the house, in open chimneys, which, when
the re was out, always kept the air in the room
cold as the climate. But taking an apartment in a.
good house in the town, I ordered a chimney to be
built like a furnace, in the centre of six several
rooms, like a stove, the funnel to carry the smoke
went up one way, the door to come at the re went
in another, and all the rooms were kept equally
I
J . noemson cnusor-2. 61,9
warm, but no re seen; just as they heat the bagnios
in England.
By this means we had always the same climate
in all the rooms, and an equal heat was preserved;
and how cold soever it was without, it was always
warm within: and yet we saw no lire, nor were
over incommoded with any smoke.
V The most wonderful thing of all was, that it
should be possible to meet with good company here,
in a country so barbarous as that of the most north-
erly parts of Europe, near the frozen ocean’, and
within but a very few tlegrces of Nova Zembla.
But this being the country where the state crimi-
nals of Muscovy, as I observed before, are “all
banished; this city was full of noblomen, princes,
gentlwneii, colonels, and, in short, all degrees of
the nobility, gentry, soldiery, and courtiers of Mus-
covy. Here were the famous prince Ci-alilofken,
or Galoffken, and hi_s son, the old general Robo-
stisky, and several other persons of note, and some
ladies. _
. By means of my Scots merchant, whom, neverthe-
less. I parted with here, I made an acquaintance
with several of these gentlemen, and some of them
of the rst rank; and from these, in the long win-
ter nights in which I staid here, I received several
agreeable visits. It was talking one night with a
certain prince, one of the banished ministers of
state belonging to the czar of Muscovy, that my
talk of my particular case began. I-lee had been
telling me abundance of ne things, of the great-
ness, the magnicence, the dominions, and the ab-
Solute power of the emperor of the Russians. I
interrupted him, and told him I was a greater and
more powerful prince than ever the czar of Muscovy
was, though my dominions were not so large, nor my
people so many. The Russian grandee looked a
little surprised; and," xing his eyes steadily upon
me, began .to wonder what I meant.
' I told him his wonder would cease when I had
explained myself. First, I told hiin I had the ab-
solute disposal of the lives and fortunes of all my
subjects: that notwithstanding my absolute power,
1 had not one person disaffected to my govern-
ment, or to my person,.in all my dominions. He
shook his head at that, and said, there indeed I
outdid the czar of Muscovy. I told him, that all
the lands in my kingdom were my own, and all
my subjects were not only my tenants, but tenants
at will; that they would all ght for me to the
last drop ; and that never tyrant, for such I acknow-
ledged myself to be, was ever so universally be-.
loved, and yet so horribly feared by his subjects.
After amusing them. with these riddles in govern-
ment for a while, I opened the case, and told them
the story at large of my living in the island, and
how I managed both myself and the people there
that were under me,just as I have since minuted it
down. They were exceedingly taken with the
story, and especially the prince, who told me with a
sigh, that‘ the true greatness of life was to be ‘master
of ourselves; that he would not have exchanged
such a state of life as mine, to have been czar of
Muscovy, and that he found more felicity in the re-
tirement he seemed to be banished to there, than ever
he found in the highest authority he enjoyed in the
court of his master the czar; that the height of hu-
man wisdom was to bring our tempers down to our
circumstances, and to make a calm within, under
the weight of the greatest storm without. When he
came rst "hIl.llGl‘, he said, he used to tear the hair
from his head, and the clothes from his back, as
others had done before him; but a little time and
consideration had made him look into himself, as
well as -round himself to things without: that he
found the mind of man, if it was but once brought
to reflect upon the state of universal life, and how
little this world was concerned in its true felicity,
was perfectly capable of making a felicity for itself,
fully satisfying to itself, and suitable to its own best
ends and desires, with but very little assistance
from the world: that air to breathe in, food to sus-
tain life, clothes for warmth, and liberty for exer-
cise in ‘order to health, completed, in his opinion, all
that the world could do for us; and though the great-
ness, the authority, the riches, and the pleasures
which some enjoyed in the world, and which he had
enjoyed his share of, had much in them that was
agreeable to us, yet he observed that all those
things chiey gratied the coarsest of our affec-
tions, sudh as our ambition, our particular pride, our
avarice, our vanity, and our sensuality; all which
were indeed the mere product of the worst part of
man, were in-themselves crimes, and had in them
the seeds of all manner of crimes; but neither
were related to, or concerned with, any of those
virtues that constituted us wise men, or of those
graces which distinguished us as Christians: that
being now deprived of all the fancied felicity
which he enjoyed in the full exercise of all those
vices, he said, he was at leisure to look upon the
dark side of them, where he found all manner of
deformity, and was now convinced that virtue
only makes a man truly wise, rich, and great, and
preserves him in the way to a superior happiness in
a future state; and in this, he said, they were
more happy in their banishment, than all their ene-
mies were, who had the full possession of all the
wealth and power that they (tho banished) had left
behind them.
‘ Nor, sir,’ said he, ‘ do I bring my mind to this
politically, by the necessity of my circumstances,
which some call miserable; but, if I know any
thing of myself, I would not now go back, no, not
though my master, the czar, should call me, and
offer to reinstate me in all my former grandeur;
I say,-I would no more go back to it, than I be-
lieve my soul, when it shall be delivered from this
prison of the body, and has had a taste of the glo-
rious state beyond life, would come back to the
Q
gaol of esh and blood it is now enclosed in, and
leave heaven to deal in the dirt and grime of human
a’airs.’ l
i He spoke this with so much warmth in his tem-
per, so much earnestness and motion of his spirits,
which were apparent in his countenance, thatit was
evident it was the true sense of his soul; and in~
deed there was no room to doubt his sincerity.
I told him, I once thought myself a kind of a
monarch in my old station, of which I had given
him an account, but that I thought. he was not a
monarch only, but a great conqueror; for that he
that has got a victory over his own exorbitant de-
sires, and has the absolute dominion over himself,
and whose reason entirely governslhis will, is cer-
tainly greater thanhe that conquers a city. ‘ But,
my lord,’ said l, ‘shall I take the liberty to ask
you a question !’ ‘ With all my heart,’ said he. ' If
the door of your liberty was opened,’ said I,
‘.would not you take hold of it ‘to deliver yourself
from this exile?’ ~ '
‘ Hold,’ said he, ‘ your question is subtle, and rel
quires some serious just distinctions, to give it a
sincere answer; and I'll give it you from tho beta
tom of my heart. Nothing that I know ol’ in this
world would move me to deliver myself from this
state ofhanislnnent, except these two; iirst, the
enjoyment of my relations, and,’ secondly, a little
warmer climate. L’-ul: I protest to you, that to go
back to the pomp of the court, the glory, the power,
the hurry of a minister of state; the wealth, the
gaiety, and the pleasures, that is to say, follies of a
courtier; if my master should send me word this
moment, that he restores me to all he banished me
from ; I protest,'iF I know myself at all, I would not
1_-eave this wilderness, these deserts, andthese Frozen
lakes, for the palace of Moscow.’
. ‘ But, my lord,’ said I, ‘ perhaps you not only are
banished from the pleasures of the cou-rt, and from
thepower, and authority,» and wealth, - you enjoyed
before; but you may-be absent too from some of
the conveniences of life, your estate, perhaps, con-
scated, and your effects plundered; and ‘the sup-
plies left you here may not be suitable to the ordi-
nary demands of life.’
‘ Aye,’ said he, ‘ that is as you suppose_,me to be a
lord, or a prince, &c. so indeed I am; but you are
now to consider me only as a man, a human crea-
ture, not at all distinguished from anotlu-1‘; and
so I can sulfer no want, unless I should be visited
with sickness and distcmpers. I-lowever, to put
the question out of dispute, you see our manner, we
are in this place ve persons of rank ; we live per-
fectly retired, as suited to a state of banishment.
We have something rescued from the shipwreck of
our fortnpes, which keeps us from the mere neces-
sity of hunting for our food, but the poor soldiers
who are here, without that help, live in as much
plenty as we. They go into the woods, and catch
Sables and foxes: the labour of a month will main-
tain them a year; and as the way. of living is not
expensive, so it is not hard lto get suicient for our-
selves : so that objection is out of doors.
I have not room to give a full account of the most
agreeable conversation l had with this truly great
man, in all which he showed that his mind was so
inspired with a superior knowledge ol’ things, so sup-
ported by religion, as well as by a vast share of
wisdom, that his contempt of the world was really
as much as he had expressed, and that he was al-
ways the same to the last, as will appear in the story
Tam going to tell.
, I had been here eight months, and a dark, dread-
ful winter I thought it to be; the cold was so in-
tense, that 1 could not so much as look abroad,
without being wrapped in furs, and a musk of fur
before my face, or rather a hood, with only a hole
for breath, and two for sight. The littledaylight
we had, was, as we reckoned, for three months, not
above ve hours a day, and six at most, only that
the snow lying on the ground continually, and the
weather clear, it was never quite dark. Our
horses were kept (or rather starved) under ground ;
and, as for our servants (for we hired servants here
to look after our horses and ourselves), we had
every now and then their ngers and toes to
thaw and take care of, lest they should mortify
and fall off.
It is true, within doors we were warm, the houses
being close, the walls thick, the lights small, and
the glass all double. Our food was chiey the esh
of deer, dried and cured in the season ; good
bread enough, but baked as biscuits; dried sh, of
several sorts, and some esh of mutton, and of the
buffaloes, which is pretty good beef. All the stores
of provision for the winter are laid up in the sum-
mer, and well cured. Our drink was water, mixed
with aquavitao, instead of brandy ; and, for a treat,
mead, instead of wine, which, however, they have
excellent good. The hunters, who venture abroad
all weathers, frequently brought us in fresh veni-
son, very fat and good ; and sometimes bears’ flesh,
but we did not much care for the last. We had a
good stock of tea, with which we treated our“f1-iends
as above; and, in a word, we lived very cheerfully
and well, all things considered.
It was now March, and the days grown considerably
longer, and the weather at least tolerable; so the
other travellers began to prepare sleds to carry them
over the snow, and to get things ready to be going;
but my measures being xed, as I have said, for
Archangel, and not for Muscovy or the Baltic, I
made no motion,‘ knowing very well, that the ships
from the south do not set out for that part of the
world till May or June; and that if I. was there by
the beginning’ of August, it would be as soon-as
any ships would be ready to go away; and there-
fore, I say, I made no haste to be gone, as others
did: in a word, I saw a great many people, nay, all
the travellers, go away before me. It seems, every
\
year they go from thence to Moscow for trade, viz.
to carry furs, and buy necessaries with them, which
they bring back to furnish their shops ; also others
went on the same errand to Archangel, but then
they also, being to come back again above eight
hundred miles, went all out before me. a
In short, about the latter end of May, I began
to make all ready to pack up ; and as I was doing
this, it occurred to me, that seeing all these people
were banished by the czar of Muscovy to Siberia,
and yet, when they came there, were left at liberty
to go whither they would, why did they not -then go
away to any part of the world, wherever they
thought lit: and I began to examine what should
hinder them from making such an attempt.
But my wonder was over, when I entered upon
that subject with the person I have mentioned, who
answered me thus: ‘Consider, rst, sir,’ said he,
‘ the place where we are; and, secondly, the con-
dition we arc in, especially,’ said he, ‘ the generality
of the people who are banished hither. "We are
surrounded,’ said he, ‘ with stronger things than
bars and bolts.: on the north side is an unnavigable
ocean, where ship never sailed, and boat never
swam; neither, if we had both, could we know
whither to go with them. Every other way,’ said
he, ‘ we have above one thousand miles to pass
througli the <~zar’s own dominions, and by ways
utterly unpassable, except by the roads made by the
government, and through the towns garrisoned by
its troops; so that we could neither pass undis-
covered by the road, nor subsist any other way, so
that it is in vain to attempt it.
I was silenced indeed at once, and found that
they were in a prison, every jot as secure as if they
had been locked up in the castle of Moscow. How-
ever, it came into my thoughts, that I might cer-
tainly be inade an instrument to procure the
escape of this excellent person, and that it was very
easy for me to carry. him away, there being no
2 E
guard over him in the country; and, as I was
not going to Moscow, but to Archangel, and that I
went in the nature of a caravan, by which I was
not obliged to lie in the stationary towns in the de-
sert, but co/uld encamp every night where I would,
we might easily pass uninterrupted to Archangel,
where I would immediately secure him on board an
lhiglisli or Dutch ship, and carry him off safe along
with me; and, as to his subsistence, and other par-
-ticulars, that should be my care, till he could bet-
ter supply himself.
Ile heard me very attentively, and looked ear-
nestly on me all the whilel spoke; nay, I could see
in his very face, that what I said put his spirits
into an exceeding ferment: his colour frequently
changed, his eyes looked red, and his heart flut-
tered, that it might he even perceived in his coun-
tenance; nor could he immediately answer me,
when I had done, and, as it were, expected what he
would say to it, and after he had paused a little, he
embraced me, _and said, ‘ How unhappy are we, un-
guided creatures as we are, that oven our greatest
acts of friendship are made snares to us, and we are
made the tempters of one another! My dear
-friend,’ said he, ‘ your offer is so sincere, has such
kindness in it, is so disinterested i11 itself, and is
so calculated for my advantage, that I must have
very little knowledge of the world, if I did not
both wonder at it, and acknowledge the obligation
'1 have upon me to you for it. But did you be-
lieve I was sincere in what I have so often said
to you of my contempt of the world P did you be-
lieve I spoke my very soul to you, and that I had
really attained that <leg'1'ee of felicity here, that
had placed me above all that the world could give
-me, or do for me? did you believe I was sincere,
when I told you I would not go back, if I was rc-
callod even to be all that once I was in the court,
and with the favour of the czar my master? did you
believe me, my friend, to be an honest man, or did
you think me to be a boasting hypocrite?’ Here he
stopped, as if he would hear what [would say;
but indeed I soon after perceived that he stopped
because his spirits were in motion, his heart was
full of struggles, and he could not go on. I was,
I confess, astonished at the thing, as well as at
the man, and I used some arguments with him to
urge him to set himself free; that he ought to
look upon this as a door oponed'by heaven for his
deliverance,‘ and a summons by Providence, who
has the care and good disposition of all events, to
do himself good, and to render himself useful in
the world.
I-Io had by this time recovered himself. ‘ I-low
do you know, sir,’ said he, warmly, ‘ but that in-
stead of a summons from heaven, it may be a feint
of another instrument, representing, in all the al-
luring" colours to me, the show of felicity as a doli-
VCl'£m(ru, which may in itself be my snare, and tend
directly to my ruin? I-{ere I am, free from the
tcmptationol’ returning to my former miserable
greatness; therc I am not sure but that all the
seeds of pride, ambition, avarice, and luxury, which
I know remain in nature, may revive and take root,
an'd, in a word, again overwhelm me, and then the
happy prisoner, whom you see now master of his
soul’s liberty, shall be the miserable slave of his
own senses, in the full of all personal liberty. Dear
sir, let mo remain in this blessed connement, ba-
nished from the crimes of life, rather than purchase
a show of freedom at the expense of the liberty of
my reason, and at the expense of the future hap-
piness which I now have in my view, but shall
then, I fear, quickly lose sight of; for I am but
flesh, a man, a mere man, have passions and a’ec-
tions as likely to possess and overthrow me as any
man. O be not-my friend and my tcmptcr both
together !’ ‘
p .If I was surprised before, I was quite dumb now,
and stood silent, looking at him, and indeed ad-
2 I5 2
mired at what I saw: the struggle in his soul was
so great, that, though the weather was extremely
cold, it put him into a most violent sweat, and I
foundhe wanted to give vent to his mind; so I said
a word or two, that I would leave him to consider of
it, and wait on him again, and then I withdrew to
my own apartment.
About two hours after, I heard somebody at, or
near, the door my of room, and I was going to
open the door; but he had opened it and came in.
‘ My dear friend,’ said he, ‘ you had almost overset
me, but I am recovered. 1)o not take it ill that I
do not close with your offer. I assure you, it is not
for want of a sense of the kindness of it in you,
and I came to make the most sincere acknowledge-
ment of it to you; but, I hope, I have got the vic-
tory over myself.’
‘ My lord,’ said I, ‘ I hope you are fully satised
that you do not resist the call of Heaven.’ ‘ Sir,’
said he, ‘if it had been from I-Ieaven, the same
power would have inuenced me to accept it; but,
I hope, and am fully satised that it is from heaven
that I decline it, and I have an innite satisfaction
in the parting, that you shall leave me an honest
man still, though not a free man.’
I had nothing to do but to acquiesce, and make
professions to him of my having no end in it, but a
sincere desire to serve him. I~Ie embraced me very
passionately, and assured me he was sensible of
that, and should always ‘acknowledge it; and with
that he offered me a very ne present of sables, too
much indeed for me to accept from a man in his cir-
cumstances; and I would have avoided them, but
he would not be refused. .
The next morning I sent my servant to his lord-
ship, with a small present of tea, two pieces of
China damask, and four little wedges of Japan
gold, which did not all weigh above six ounces;
or thereabout; but were far short of the value of
his sables, which indeed, when I came to England,
I found worth near two hundred pounds. He ac-
cepted the tea, and one piece of the damask, and
one of the pieces of gold, which had a ne stamp
upon it, of the Japan coinage, which I found he
took for the rarity of it, but would not take any
more; and he sent word, by my servant, that he de-
sired to speak with me.
When I came to him, he told me I knew what
had passed between us, and hoped I would not move
him any more in that affair; but that since I had
made such a generous olfer to him, he asked me, if
I had kindness enough to o‘er the same to another
person that he would name to me, in whom he had
a great share of concern. I told him, that I could
not say I inclined to do so much for any one but
himself, For whom I had a particular value, and
should have been glad to have been the instrument
of his deliverance. However, if he would please to
name the person to me, I would give him my an-
swer, and hoped he would not be displeased with
me, if he was with my answer. I-Ie told me, it was
only his son, who, though I had not seen him, yet
was in the same condition with himself, and above
two hundred miles from him, on the other side the
Oby; but t-hat, if I consented, he would send for
him.
' 1 made no hesitation, but told him I would do it.
I made some ceremony in letting him understand,
that it was wholly on his account; and that seeing I
could not prevail on him, I would show my respect
to him by my concern for his son : but these things
are too tedious to repeat here. I-Ie sent away the
next day for his son, and in about twenty days he
came back with the messenger, bringing six or
seven horses, loaded with very rich furs, and which,
in the whole, amounted to avery great value.
I-Iis servants brought the horses into the town,
but left the young lord at a distance till night,
when he came irzcognito into our apartment, and his
father presented him to me ; and, in short, we cou-
certed there the manner of our travelling, and every
thing proper for the journey.
I had bought a considerable quantity of sables,
black fox-skins, fine ermines, and such other furs
that are very rich; I say, I had bought them in
that city in exchange for some oi’ the goods I
brought from China: in particular, for the cloves
and nutmegs, of which I soldsthe greatest part here,
and the rest afterwards at Arcl1an,5;el, for a much
better price than I could have done at London;
and my partner, who was sensible of the prot, and
whose business more particularly than mine was
merchandise, was mightily pleased with our stay, on
account of the traffic we made here.
It was the beginning of June, when I left this re-
mote place, a city, I believe, little heard ofin the
world, and indeed it is so far out of the road of
commerce, that I know not how it should be much
talked of. We were new come to a very small cara-
van, being only thirty-two horses and camels in all,
and all of them passed for mine, though my new
guest was proprietor of eleven of them. It was
most natural also, that I should take more servants
with me than I had before, and the young lord
passed for my steward; what great man I passed
for myself, I know not, neither did it concern me to
inquire. We had here the worst and the largest
desert to pass over that we met with in all the jour-
ney; indeed I call it the worst, because the way
was very deep in some places, and very uneven in
others: the best we had to say for it, was, that we
thought we had no troops of ’l‘artars and robbers to
fear, and Ithat they never came on this side of the
river Oby, or, at least, but very seldom; but we
found it otherwise.
My young lord had with him a faithful Muscovite
servant, or rather a Siberian servant, who was’ per-
fectly acquainted with the country, and who led us
by private roads, that we avoided coming into the
principal towns and cities, upon the great road,
such as T umen, Soloy-Kamaskoy, and several others,
because the Muscovite garrisons which are kept
there, are very curious and strict in their observa-
tion upon travellers, and searching lest any of the
banished persons of note should make their escape
that way into Museovy; but by this means, as we
were kept out of the cities, so our wholejourney
was a desert, and we were obliged to encamp, and
lie in our tents, when we might have had very good
accommodation in the cities on the way. This the
young lord was so sensible of, that he would not
allow us to lie abroad, when we came to several
cities on the way, but lay abroad himselt‘, with his
servant, in the woods, and met us always at the ap-
pointed places. I
We were just entered Europe, having passed the
river Kama, which, in these parts, is the boundary
between Europe and Asia ; and the rst city, on the
European side, was called Soloy-Kaniaskoy, which
is as much as to say, the great city_on the river
Kama; and here we thought to have seen some
evident alteration in the people, their manners,
their habit, religion, and their business; but we
were mistaken, for as we had a vast desert to pass,
which, by relation, is near seven hundred miles
long, in some places, but not above two hundred
miles over where we passed it; so, till we came
past that horrible place, we found very little dili-
ference between that country and the liibgul Tar-
tary, and the people mostly pagans, and little better
than the szivagacs oi" America; their houses and
towns full of idols, and their way of living wholly
barbarous, except in the cities as above, and the
villages near them, where they are Christians, as
they call themselves, of the Greek church; but even
these have their religion iningled with so many re-
liques of superstition, that it is scarce to be known
in some places from mere sorcery and witchcraft.
In passing this forest, I thought indeed we must,
after all our dangers were, in our imagination,
\
escaped, as before, have been plundered and robbed,
and, perhaps, murdered, by a troop of thieves: of
what country they were, whether the roving bands
of the Ostiachi, a kind of Tartars, or wild people
on the bank of the Oby, and ranged thus far, or
whether they were the sable-hunters of Siberia, I
am yet at a loss to know; but they were all on
horseback, carried bows and arrows, and were at
rst about ve-and-forty in number: theyeame so
near to us, as within about two musket-shot, and,
asking no questions, they surrounded us with their
horse, and looked very earnestly upon us twice.
At length they placed themselves just in our way,
upon which we drew up in a little line before our
camels, being not above sixteen men in all; and
sent out the Siberian servant who attended his
lord, to see who they were. His master was the
more willing to let him go, because he was not a.
little apprehensive, that they were a Siberian troop
sent out after him. The man came up near them,
with a ag of truce, and called to them; but though
he spoke several of their languages, or dialects of
languages rather, he could not understand a word
they said. However, after some signs to him, not
to come nearer to them, at his peril, so he said he
understood them to mean, offering to shoot at him
if he advanced, the fellow came back no wiser than
he went; only that, by their dress, he said, he be-
lieved them to be some Tartars of Kalmuck, or of
the Circassianhordes, and that there must be more
of them, on the great desert, though he never heard
that ever any of them were seen so far north be-
fore.
This was small comfort to us. However, we had
no remedy. There was, on our left hand, at about
a quarter of a 1nile’s distance, a little grove or
clump of trees, which stood close together, and very
near the road. I immediately resolved we would
advance to those trees, and fortify ourselves as well
as we could there ; for, rst," I considered that the
trees would, in a great measure, cover us from
their arrows, and, in the next place, they could not
come to charge us in a body. Lt was indeed my
old Portuguese pilot who proposed it, and who had
this excellency attending him, namely, that he was
always readicst and most apt to direct and encou-
rage us, in cases of the most danger. We advanced
immediately with what speed we could, and gained
that little wood, the Tartars, or thieves, for we
knew not what to call them, keeping their stand,
and not _attempting to hinder us. When we came
thither, we found, to our great satisfaction, that it
was a swampy, springy piece of ground, and, on
the one side, a very great spring of water, which
running out in a little rill, or brook, was a little far-
ther joined by another of the like bigness, and was,
in short, the head, or source, of a considerable river,
called afterwards the Wirtska. The trees which
grew about this spring were not in all above two
‘hundred, but were very large, and stood pretty
thick; so that as soon as we got in, we saw our-
selves perfectly safe from the enemy, unless they
alighted and attacked us _on foot.
But, to make this more diicult, our Portuguese,
with indefatigable application, cut down great
arms of the trees, and laid them hanging", not cut
quite o, from one tree to another; so that he
made a continued fence, almost round us.
We staid here, waiting the motion of the enemy
some hours, without perceiving they made any
offer to stir, when, about two hours before night,
they came directly upon us; and, though we had
not perceived it, we found they had been joined by
some more of the same, so thaththey were near
fourscore horse; whereof, however, we fancied
some were women. They came on till they were
within half a shot of our little wood, when we tired
one‘ musket, without ball, and called to them, in the
Russian tongue, to know what they wanted, and
bade them keep off; but, as if they knew nothing
of what we said, they came on with a double fury,
directly up to the wood side, not imagining we were-
so barricadood that they could not break in. Our
old pilot was our captain, as well as he had been
our engineer, and desired of us not to re upon
them till they came‘ within pistol shot. that we
might be sure to kill ; and that when we did iire,we
should be sure to take good aim. We bade him
give the word of command, which he delayed so
long, that they were, some of them, within two
pikes’ length of us when we red.
We aimed so true (oi-Providence directed our
shot so sure), that we killed fourteen of them at
the rst volley, and wounded. several others, as also
several of their horses; for we had all of us loaded
our pieces with two or three bullets apiece, at least.
They were terribly surprised with our re, and re-
treated immediately about one hundred rods from
us, in which time we loaded our pieces again, and
seeing them keep at that distance, we sallied out,
and caught four or five of their horses, whose
riders, we supposed, were killed; and, coming up
to the dead, we could easily perceive they were
Tartars, but knew not from what country, or how
they came to make an excursion of such an unusual
length.
About an hour after, they made a motion to at-
tack us again, and rode round our little wood, to
see where else they might break in ; but nding us
always ready to face them, they went off again, and
we resolved not to stir from the place for that
night. '
We slept little, you may be sure, but spent the
most part of the night in strengthening our situa-
tion, and barricadoing the entrances into the wood;
and, keeping a strict watch, we waited for daylight,
and, when it came, it gave us a very unwelcome
discovery indeed; for the enemy, who we thought
we're discouraged with the reception they had met
with, were now increased to no less than three hun-
dred, and had set up eleven or twelve huts and
tents, as if they were resolved to besiege us: and
this little camp they had pitched was upon the open
plain, at about three quarters of a mile from us.
We were indeed surprised at this discovery, and
now, I confess, I gave myself over for lost, and all
that'I had. The loss of my effects did not lie so
near me (though they were very considerable), as
the thoughts of falling into the hands of such bar-
barians, at the latter end of myjourney, after so
many diiculties and hazards as I had gone through;
and even in sight of our port, where we expected
safety and deliverance. As for my partner, he was
raging; he declared that to lose his goods would be
his ruin, and he would rather die than be starved ;
and he was for ghting to the last drop.
The young lord, as gallant as ever esh showed
itself, was for ghting to the last also ; and my old
pilot was of opinion that we were able to resist
them all, in the situation we then were in: and
thus we spent the day in debates ofwhat we should
do; but towards evening we found that the num-
ber of our enemies still increased. Perhaps, as they
were abroad in several parties for prey, the rst had
sent out scouts to call for help, and to acquaint
them of the booty; and we did not know but by
the morning they might still he a greater number;
so I began to inquire of those people we had
brought from Tobolski, if there was no other, or
more private ways, by which we might avoid them
in ,,_the night, and, perhaps, eithc._r retreat to some
town, or get help to guard us over the desert.
The Siberian, who was servant to the young lord,
told us, if we designed to avoid them, and not ght,
he would engage to carry us o‘ in the night to a
way that went north, toward the river Petraz, by
which he made no question but we might get away,
and the Tartars never the wiser; but, he said, his
lord had told him, he would not retreat, but would
rather choose to ght. I told him, he mistook his
lord, for that he was too wise a man to love ghting
jor the sake of it; that I knew his lord was brave
enough, by what he had showed already; but that
his lord knew better, than to- desire to have seven-
teen or eighteen men ght ve hundred, unless an
unavoidable necessity forced them to it ; and that,
if he thought it possible for us to escape in the
night, we had nothing else to do but to attempt it.
He answered, if his lord gave him such an order, he
would lose his life, if he did not perform it. We
soon brought his lord to give that order, though
privately, and we immediately prepared for the put-
ting it in praetice..
And, rst, as soon as it began to be dark, we
kindled a re in our little camp, which we kept
burning, and prepared so as to make it burn all
night, that the Tartars might conclude we were
still there; but as soon as it was dark, that is to
say, so as we could see the stars (for our guide
would not stir before), having all our horses and
camels ready loaden, we followed our new guide,
who, I soon found, steered himself by the pole, or
north star, all the country being level for a long
way. ‘
After we had travelled two hours very hard, it
began to be lighter still ; not that it was quite dark
all night, but the moon began to rise, so that, in
short, it was rather lighter than we wished it to be;
but by six o’clock', next morning, we were gotten
near forty miles, though the truth is, we almost
spoiled our horses. Here we found a Russian ;vil-
lage, named Kirmazinskoy, where we rested, and
heard nothing‘ of the Kalmuck Tartars that day.
About two hours before night we set out again, and
travelled till eight the next morning, though not
quite so hastily as before; and about seven o’cloclc
we passed a little river called Kirtza, and came to
a good large town, inhabited by Russians, and very
populous, called. Ozomoys. There we heard, that se-
veral troops or hordes of Kahnucks had been abroad
upon the desert, but that we were now completely
out of danger of them, which was to our great sa-
tisfaction, you may be sure. Here we were obliged
to get some fresh horses, and, having need enough
of rest, we staid ve days; and my partner and I
agreed to give the honest Siberian, who brought us
thither, the value of ten pistoles, for his conducting
us. _
In ve days more we came to Veussima, upon
the river Witzogdzi, which running into the river
Dwina, we were there very happily near the end
of our travels by land, that river being naviga-
ble in seven days’ passage to Archangel. From
hence ‘we came to Lawrenskoy, where the river
joins, the third of July,,and provided ourselves
with two luggage-boats, and a barge, for our con-
venience. We embarked the seventh, and arrived
all safe at Archangel the eighteenth, having been a
year, ve months, and three days, on thejouruey,
including our stay of eight months and odd days
at Tobolski.
We were obliged to stay at this place six weeks
for the arrival of the ships, and must have tarried
longer, had not a Hamburgher come in above n
month sooner than any of the English ships; when
after some consideration, that the city of _I~Iam-
burgh might happen to be as good a market for
our goods as London, we all took freight with him;
and, having put our goods on board, it was most na~
tural for me to put my steward on board, to take
care of them, by’ which means my young lord had a
suicient opportunity to‘ conceal himself, never
coming on shore again in all the time we staid
there; and this he did, that he might not be seen
in the city, where some of the Moscow merchants
would certainly have seen and discovered him.
We sailed from Archangel the twentieth of Au-
gust, the same year, and, after no extraordinary
bad voyage, arrived in the Elbe, the thirteenth
ef September. I'Iere my partner and I found a very
good sale for our goods, as well those of China, as
the sables, &c. of Siberia; and dividing the pro.-
duce of our effects, my share amounted to three
thousand four hundred and seventy-live pounds,
seventeen shillings, and three-pence, notwithstand-
ing so many losses we had sustained and charges
we had been at, only remembering that I had in-
cluded in this about six hundred pounds’ worth of
diamonds, which I had purchased at Bengal.
Here the young lord took his leave of us, and
went up the Elbe, in order to go to the court of
Vienna, where he resolved to seek protection, and
where he could correspond with those of his father's
friends, who were left alive. I-Ie did not part
without all the testimonies he could give me of
gratitude for the service I had done him, and his
sense of my kindness to the prince his father.
To conclude: having staid near four months in
Ilamburgh, I came from thence over land to the
Hague, where I embarked in the packet, and ar-
rived in London the tenth of January, 1705, having
been gone from England ten years and nine months.
And here, resolving to harass myself no more, I
am preparing for a longer journey than all these,
having lived seventy-two years, a life of infinite
variety, and learned suiciently to know the value
of retirement, and the blessing of ending our days
in peace. .
THE END.
