youngest son of his parents.
His father wasa man of some
wealth, able to give his son a good
home, and to send him to school.
It was his wish that his son should
become a lawyer. but the boy's head
began very early to be filled with
thoughts of travel, and nothing
would satisfy him but to go to sea.
His father gave him wise and
earnest counsel against it. and for a
time his advice prevailed; but in
the end the boy's desire to roam
led him to set his father's wishes at naught. One day.
being at Hull, a seaport town of England, he met a school-
fellow who was about to sail in his father's ship. and was
; urged by him to go with'him. In an evil hour he yielded.
.' and without asking God's blessing or his father's, he went
' on board.
One day. when they had been out about two weeks. a
great storm came up. and the ship struck a rock near a
. strange coast. The crew launched a boat. and sought to
, escape in it. but the waves soon overturned it, and all were
separated in the sea. Robinson Crusoe was carried by a
wave toward the shore, and at length thrown upon the
land senseless. '
When he recovered he began to look about to see if any
of his comrades had escaped, but he could see no sign of
~ any of them.
Night coming on, he climbed into a thick, bushy tree to
sleep, not knowing but that there might be ravenous
beasts there. \Vhen he awoke next morning. the sea was calm. ;

visions were dry. and being very hungry. filled his pockets with

them, he had a raft strong enough
to bear a moderate weight. Next he
lowered upon it three seamen's chests,
and filled them with provisions. After
a long search he found the carpenters
chest. which was a great prize to him. He

lowered it upon the raft, and then secured a

supply of guns and gunpowder. With this cargo he -

started for the shore, and succeeded In landing it safe.
His next work was to view the country, and seek a proper place

to stow his goods. He knew not yet where he was. whether on a
continent or an island. Seeing a hill not over a mile away, very
steep and high. he climbed to the top of it, and discovered that
he was on an island, barren, and probably uninhabited, except by
wild animals. ,

When Robinson Crusoe realized the lonely, desperate situation
that he was in. his heart sank, and he almost wished that he had
perished with the others. But soon perceiving the ingratitude of
this state of mind, he fell upon his knees to thank God for saving
his life.---his alone among so many,--and a feeling of confidence
arose in his breast that He would still protect' him in the midst of
the perils by which he was surrounded.

of the twelfthday there'wa's a violent wind. and when he awoke In
the morning the ship was nowhere to be seen.

He then gave his thoughts to providing himselfwith a safe dwell-
ing-place. Although he had hardly ever handled tools before
in his life, his needs now forced him to find out their use. He set
himself at work to build a hut. or cabin, out of the timbers he had
saved from the wreck. It was a task that took a long time, but
at last. by effort and contrivance, it was finished, and he had a
fairly comfortable house, which he called his castle.

After it was completed. he applied himself to making other
things that would add to his comfort. First. he made a chair and
a table. with an immense amount of labor, for each board that he

clothes. he saved the skins of all the creatures he shot. and dried
them. and made garments for himself out of them. In addition.
at the cost of a great deal of time and trouble. he made. also of
skins, an umbrella. which he needed greatly to keep off both sun
and rain.

He had found upon the ship two cats and a dog. The cats he

carried ashore on the raft. while the dog swam ashore himself. and
was a trusty servant to Robinson Crusoe for many years. Beside
the company of these pets, he had that of a parrot which he
caught and taught to speak. and its chatter served to while away
many hours that would otherwise have been dreary.

He went out every day with his gun to hunt for food. Hefound that there were goats
running wild on the island, and
he often succeeded in shooting some
of them. But he saw that his powder and
shot would, in time. all be gone, and that
to have a steady supply of goat's flesh. he
must breed them in flocks. So he set a
trap to take some alive. and caught sev.
cral. He enclosed a piece of ground for
them to run in: and in time had a large flock
which furnished him with all the meat he needed.

For a long time he hrooded over the idea of makinga canoe out
of the trunk of a tree, and at last he succeeded in shaping with his
axe a rough vessel in which he sailed around the island.

Years and years of this lonely life passed away. Although
Crusoe had. to some extent. become contented with his solitary lot
yet at times a terrible sense of loneliness and desolation would
comevover him. Many times wouldhe go to the top of a hill

in an agony of misery

and despair he would

""<<W'ai'w >> sob like a child.

But one day he saw a sight which. while it gave him cause for
alarm. served to turn his thoughts in a new channel. It was the
print of a naked foot upon the sand near the shore. It filled him
with a new fear, for 'it showed that the island must sometimes be
visited by savages.

One morning, going out quite early, he could see the light of
a fire about two miles away. He stole up under the cover of trees
and bushes until he was near enough to observe what was going on.
He' saw that five canoes were drawn up on the shore. while a
swarm of naked savages were dancing about a fire. Presently they
dragged two. poor wretches from the boats. One of them was
knocked down at once, and several of the savages set to work tocut him up. They were evidently cannibals, that is, people who
eat men, and were going to hold one of their horrible feasts upon
their captives. The other captive was left standing for a moment,
and seeing a chance to escape, started to run. Robinson Crusoe

was greatly alarmed when he saw that the runaway was coming

directly toward himself, but when he saw that only two pursued.

and that the runaway gained upon them, he made up his mind to I:
help him. \Vhen they were near enough, Robinson Crusoe stepped "
in between the runaway and his pursuers, and advancing on the
foremost of the latter, knocked him down with the stock of his
gun. The other raised his bow and was going to shoot, when 4-"
Robinson Crusoe fired at him and killed him. Then he made
signs to the runaway to come to him, and the poor creature did so
in fear and trembling, kneeling at Crusoe's feet as a sign that he '-
was his slave. Crusoe took him home to his castle and gave him
something to eat. Robinson Crusoe had now a companion, and
in a short time he began to teach him to speak English. First he
let him know that his name was to be Friday, for that was the day
on which his life had been saved. Then he taught him everything\
that he thought would make him useful, handy, arul helpful. He
clothed him in a suit made of goatskins, and the poor fellmv seem-
ed to be greatly pleased to be dressed like his master.

One day Robinson Crusoe took him with him when he went
hunting, and was much amused at the way his gun mystified him.
He first shot a bird. Friday didn't see it fall,
and was greatly frightened by the noise of the
gun. but when Robinson Crusoe pointed
to the bird, and made signs for him
to pick it up, he was
filled with wonder and
amazement. It wasa
long time before he
could understand the
nature of fire-arms, or
overcome his fear of
the gun, which he
seemed to think was

begging it not to kill him.

After he had learned enough English to be able to talk freely.
he told Robinson Crusoe of a party of shipwrecked Spanish sailors.

seized Crusoe : and he set about making. with Friday's assistance,
a boat large enough to carry both over.

But on: morning. before they had got on very far with the task.
Friday came running in a state of great fright. to tell that three
canoes. full of savages. had landed on the island. Robinson Crusoe
armed himself with a sword and a hatchet. and taking all the gunsthey could carry, he and Friday went to a thicket of trees which
stood near where the savages were. From there they could see
them sitting about fires they had made. eating the flesh of one
victim. while another captive, a white man, lay bound near by.

Perceiving that there was no time to lose if they would save the
captive. Robinson Crusoe took one gun and Friday another, and
both fired into the crowd together. They killed and wounded
several, and the rest were thrOwn into the wildest confusion. They
continued firing until they had emptied their guns. Then they
rushed forward, and, Friday using the hatchet and Crusoe the
sword, they killed all the remaining savages, except four who suc-
ceeded in reaching their canoes. Bidding Friday'release the white
captive, Crusoe ran to another of the canoes, intending to pursue
the savages to sea, but in the canoe he was surprised to find a poor
creature bound hand and foot. He cut him free, and helped him to
rise, for he could hardly stand. Friday coming up, Crusoe bid him
speak to the man, and tell him he was saved. When Friday heard
the man answer, he first looked at him with astonishment, then
embraced and' kissed him, and laughed, jumped about, and sung.
like one that was mad. When he came a little to himself he told
Crusoe that the captive was his father. ,

The two rescued men were then taken to the castle ; and Crusoe
learned from the white man that he was one of the Spaniards of
whom Friday had told him. It was proposed that he should return
to the mainland with Friday's father in the new boat, as soon as it
was completed, and bring the rest of his countrymen to Crusoe's
island to live. This was agreed to. and all set to work to finish the
boat. Finally everything was ready and they set sail.

One morning, a short time after. Friday brought word to Crusoe
that a ship was in sight. This was news so welcome to Crusoe that
he went nearly wild with joy, but presently the prudent thought
occurred to him that it might be well not to let those aboard see
him, until he could learn something about their business there. Sohe watched in concealment.
and in a short time saw a boat
leave the ship and make for the shore.
Eleven men landed, and Crusoe saw that
while most of them dispersed about the
island, three kept by themselves and ap-
peared to be much dejected. When the
others were out of hearing.
Crusoe approached these three
and began to question them. and
found that they were English.that one

that there had been a mutiny on board,

tain granted on condition that they would return to their duty. and
swear to assist him In recovering the ship, to which they all agreed.
many of them gladly. fer they had "been. forced into the mutiny by
some of the bolder and more vicious spirits among them.

The task of taking the ship was postponed until midnight. when
most of those aboard would be asleep. Those on watch, when they
saw the boat approach, Supposed it was merely the sailors who had
gone ashore returning after disposing of the' prisoners, and they "
were held in chat until the party got aboard, when they were im-

secured. Then all the hat- I

When this was done, the "t'

rushed into the round-house. wounded as he was. and with his pistol
shot the new captain through the head. so that he never spoke
more. Upon that the rest yielded. and the ship was etTectunlly

turn for what he had done for him. Crusoe told him that he asked
nothing more than that he should carry Friday and himself to Eng-
land. and this the captain gladly agreed to do. He provided Cru-
soc with clothing from his own wardrobe. and Crusoe took aboard
with him. in addition to some gold that lk'. had saved from the
wreck only his goatskin coat and cap and his umbrella. which he:wished to keep for relics.
Everything else on the island
he left for the Spaniards when they
should return from the mainland, and
he wrote out for their benefit a full ac-
count of his way of living. and all his
plans and contrivances. He also induced
the captain to leave a supply of tools that
he knew would be useful to them. and an
assortment of seeds of various kinds. Then they
set sail. and Robinson Crusoe left the island. twenty-eight
years. two months and nineteen days after he had landed upon it. .
Three days after setting sail. as they passed near the coast of an
island. they saw close to:..the shore a great fleet of canoes. full of
savages armed with hows ahd arrows. They were going through
strange evolutions. and Friday said that they were probably setting
out to make war on some other tribe. When they caught sight of
the ship. and saw that those on board were watching them. they

 
 
  

 

came paddling toward it. and soon were swarming about on all
sides. uttering curious cries. and making uncouth gestures. ' Those
on the ship were very much puzzled 'to know what their intentions
could be. and finally Robinson Crusoe told Friday to go on the up
per deck and speak to them in his own language. which he hoped
they might be able to understand. Friday did as he was bid. but
had spoken only a few words when the savages let fly a great
cloud of arrows at him. So poor was their aim that only three of
the arrows struck him. but one of the three pierced him through
the heart, and he fell dead.

When Robinson Crusoe saw this he became almost frantic with
rage. and ordered the ship's guns to be loaded with grapeshot and
fired into the fleet. The effect was tremendous. More than halfof the canoes were destroyed, and the sea for a time was covered
with the wretched savages, struggling to swim, and uttering the
most frightful howls. The fortunate ones in those of the canoes
that had not been hit did not wait to help their comrades, but
specded off as fast as they could paddle. One by one the others
sunk. and in a short time the sea was as clear of them as if they
had never been there.

Thus a terrible vengeance was taken for Friday's death, but his
master felt little consoled thereby. The poor fellow was so honest.
faithful, and affectionate. and had ways so cheerful and pleasant. that
Robinson Crusoe had grown to be most sincerely attached to him.
and he now mourned him as if he had been a son. He caused his
body to be buried in the sea with all the honors possible. and it
seemed to him as if the delight of being restored to his old home
hardly made up for the loss of one who had become so dear to him.

The voyage homeward was continued; and no further mishap
occurring, Robinson Crusoe arrived safe in England after his many
years of absence. He found that his father and mother were dead.
as well as many of his old friends. and for a time he felt almost as
lonely as on his island. But he married a worthy wife before long.
and buying a farm with '1'" gold he had brought home. settled
down to a quiet country life. He was blast with children who
grew up to be his delight and comfort. and his old age was spent
in peace and happiness.
