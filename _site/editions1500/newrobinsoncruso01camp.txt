PREFACE. 



PREFACE. 



SOME writers have affirmed than 
mankind are all born with the same 
dispositions and the same degree of un- 
derstanding ; and that education, laws, 
and customs, create all the difference 
perceivable between man and man. I 
confess, I can hardly bring myself to 
suppose that education alone produced 
the wide dissimilarity which exists be- 
tween the characters of Thersites and 
Achilles, or those of- Socrates and Any- 
tus : at the same" time it will ever be an 
acknowledged truth, that even he who 
is most indebted to Nature will reap

but small advantage from her gifts, 
unless they are improved by mature 
and judicious cultivation 

]t is unnecessary to undertake a serious 
demonstration of a truth universally ad- 
mitted in all ages and nations; a truth 
confirmed by daily experience, and the 
practice of which was the object con- 
stantly aimed at by the labours both of 
the philosopher and the bulk of man- 
kind. The improvement of the latter, 
as far as it can be effected by education, 
has been more attended to in the present 
age than ever it was in any preceding 
one. If the endeavour used to this 
purpose have not had all the success 
that might be expected from them, they 
have at least excited the attention and 
directed the minds of men towards an 
object, the accomplishment of which, 
as it is more or !e<s perfect, has ever a 

pro- 



PREFACE. Q 

proportionable effect upon thejiappw 
ness of families, and consequently upon 
the state of society in general. 

A great genius of the present age has 
contributed, even by his false opinions, 
towards the accomplishmentof this im- 
portant object : for the errors of great 
men are remarked, and the discussion 
of them frequently leads to the truth 
from which they have deviated. Thus 
Mr. Rousseau's Emilius will, in spite 
of the false opinions advanced in it, 
always be a valuable book, both on ac- 
count of the important truths which it 
contains, and those which it has caused 
to be discovered ; and \t would be un- 
just not to attribute to it at least a. con- 
siderable enlargement in our ideas con- 
cerning education. 

To free our species, as far as in us 

lies, from the ailments and disabilities 

A 5 to 



PR] 

to which Nature subjects them 1: 
t\ . lr very birth, is a great object, but 
certainly not the only one. It is essen- 
tial to society that its members be sound 
and robust in constitution ; but if they 
are not, at the same time, honest, just, 
and good, they will be of more preju- 
dice than advantage to society. Mr. 
llousseau was perfectly sensible of this 
truth ; he has paid considerable atten- 
tion to it ; but, if I may be allowed 
the assertion, he was frequently de- 
ceived both in the nature of social vir- 
tue, and the extent to which it should 
be practised. While he boldly attacks 
the prejudices under which we arc en- 
slaved from our infancy, he has, on the 
other hand, denied, or endeavoured to 
render doubtful, many valuable truths, 
which constitute our happiness in a 
more advanced age. While he meant 

to 



PREFACE. II 

to prune away the greedy branches that 
impeded the growth of the tree, he 
has, though perhaps without intention, 
wounded its very roots. Whilst he 
wishes to assist Nature, he allows Na- 
ture too much; and where he thought 
he found her defective, he has not al- 
ways been able to find the best means 
of supplying her defects. In a word, 
young Emilius is the child of Mr. 
Rousseau's fancy, not the child of edu- 
cation. 

Nevertheless,., the following work is 
indebted to that of Mr. Rousseau for 
the form that it bears. Mr. Campe, the 
author of it, expresses himself thus : " I 
never read the following passage in the 
second volume of Emilius v-ithout the 
most sensible satisfaction. Nothingupon 
earth can be so well calculated to in- 
spire one with ardour in the execution 
A 6 of

of a plan approved by so great a ge- 
nius/' 

" Might there not be found means/' 
says Rousseau, " to bring together so 
many lessons of instruction that lie scat- 
tered in so many books ; to apply them 
through a single object of a familiar and 
not uncommon nature, capable of en- 
gaging the imitation, as well as rousing 
and fixing the attention even at so ten- 
der an age ? If one could imagine a 
situation, in which all the natural wants 
of man appear in the 'dearest light to 
the understanding of a child, and in 
which the means of satisfying these 
wants unfold themselves successively m 
the same clear, easy manner, the lively 
and natural description of such a state 
should be the first means that I would 
use to set his imagination at work. 
u I see thine expand already, thou ar- 
dent 



PREFACE. 13 

dent philosopher. But be not in pain; 
we have found such a situation. It is 
described, and no disparagement to your 
talents, much better than you would 
describe it yourself, at least with more 
truth and simplicity. Since we must 
have books, there is one that furnishes, 
in my opinion, the best imagined trea- 
tise upon natural education ' that can 
possibly be. This book shall be the firft 
that I will put into the hands of my 
Emilius ; this singly shall for a long 
time compose his whole library, and 
indeed shall always hold a distinguished 
place there. It shall be the text to 
which all our discourses upon natural 
science shall serve as a commentary. It 
shall be the criterion of our taste and 
judgment; and, as long as these re- 
main uncorrupted, the reading of it 
will always be agreeable to us. Well, 

then^ 



}4 PREFACE. 

then, what is this wonderful book? Is 
it Aristotle, Pliny, Buffon? — No: it is 
Robinson Crusoe. 

1 'Robinson Crusoe, alone in his island, 
deprived of the assistance of his fellow- 
creatures, without * tools of any sort, 
yet providing for his safety and subsist- 
ence, and even procuring himself a sort 
of happiness, presents a subject interest- 
ing to every age, and which there might 
be a thousand ways of making agree- 
able to children. This you see realizes 
the ideal circumstances of the desert 
island, which I used at first as a com- 
parison. I grant, it is by no means the 
state of man as destined for society ; 

* Mr. Rousseau is mistaken here. The Old Ro- 
binson Crusoe has plenty e£ tools and instruments, 
which he saves from the wreck of a ship; whereas 
the New Robinson Crusoe has nothing but his head 
and his hands to depend on for his preservation. 

nay 



PREFACE. 15 

nay, probably Emilius might never ex- 
perience such a situation ; nevertheless, 
it is that by which he should estimate 
the value of every other condition in 
life. The surest way to rise superior to 
all prejudice, and to form our judgment 
upon the true report of things, is to 
place ourselves in the situation of a man 
cut off from all society, and to judge of 
every thing as that man must naturally 
judge, regard being had at the same 
time to his own degree of utility in the 
sphere of existence. 

" This story, cleared of all its unne- 
cessary rubbish, beginning with Ro- 
binson's being shipwrecked upon his 
island, and ending with the arrival of 
the vessel that takes him away, shall 
be both the amusement and instruction 
of Emilius during the tender age that I 
ipe-ak- of. I will have his rtead run 

upon 



1 6 PREFACE, 

upon nothing else but Robinson Crusoe; 
he shall talk incessantly about his castle, 
his goats, and his plantations. He 
shall learn, not from books, but from 
things, every single particular necessary 
to be known in such a case; he shall 
imagine himself tobc a Robinson Crusoe, 
and dress himself up in skins, with a 
great cap on his head, a broad sword 
by his side, and, in short, the whole of 
the grotesque dress and accoutrements 
with which we generally see Robinson 
Crusoe's picture represented, except the 
umbrella, for he shall have no occasion 
for that. I will have him study how 
he should proceed if he happened to be 
in want of this or that necessary; he 
shall examine his hero's conduct, and 
try if he has left nothing undone, or if 
he went the best way to work about 
what he has done; he shall remark 

where 



PREFACE. 17 

where he is wrong, and take care not 
to fall into the same mistake himself; 
for you need not have the least doubt 
but he will be for imitating Robinson 
in his whole plan. Nothing, indeed, 
can be better calculated to please the 
imagination at that calm period of life, 
when, if our wants are satisfied, and 
our actions unrestrained/ we look no 
farther for happiness. 

*' What advantage may not an able 
master take of this romantic project in 
a child ! a project to which he himself 
has given birth for the sake of the pro- 
fitable fruits that may be reaped from it. 
The child, ever busy and eager to make 
provision for his island settlement, will 
be more ready to learn than the master 
to teach. He will desire to know every 
thing that is useful, and nothing more; 

you

you will have no occasion to spur him 
on. — The exercise of the natural arts, 
for which one man alone is sufficient, 
leads to the invention of the arts of in- 
dustry, which require the co-operation 
of many hands." 

This Passage from Rousseau will ex- 
plain, infinitely better than I can, the 
utility of a book composed upon such 
a plan; it now remains to be seen how 
far Mr, Campe, the author of the fol- 
lowing work, has pursued Mr. Rous- 
seau's idea. 

The public is pretty generally agreed 
not to dependonthe report of translators 
concerning the works which they trans- 
late, especially if their judgment be 
favourable to the original': and I be- 
lieve this caution is well founded ; for 
it is no easv matter to decide with im- 

partiality 



PREFACE. I# 

partiality where self-opinion has equal 
influence with justice in passing the 
sentence. 

Perhaps some may not think as I do 
concerning this work of Mr. Campe's; 
particularly, those who arc fond of me- 
taphysical treatises upon education, will, 
no doubt, be disappointed to find no- 
thing in the New Robinson Crusoe but 
things that are useful, introduced in an 
unaffected manner, clearly expressed and 
demonstrated without pedantry ; they 
will be surprised to see children speak 
like children, and their instructor as- 
sume the simple language of childhood, 
in order to make himself understood. 
Thc^e who are governed by the spirit of 
free thinking will find it strange that 
religion is respected and rendered re- 
spectable in this work; that God is re- 
presented as the mover of all things, 

and 



20 PREl-'ACfc 

and the principle to which all our ac- 
tions should be referred, as well as the 
motives which determine them, and 
the sentiments which gave them birth. 
These are, no doubt, particularities that 
may be remarked: nevertheless, at this 
time of day, to think wisely, we must 
not always think with philosophers. 

U The Old Robinson Crusoe," says 
Mr. Campe, in his preface to the original 
of this work, " independent of its other 
defects, is erroneous in one particular 
sufficient to destroy every advantage that 
tiiis History might produce, which is, 
that Robinson Crusoe is provided with 
all sorts of European tools and instru- 
ments neceffary to procure him many 
of those conveniences that belong to 
society. Thus the opportunity is lost 
of affording the young reader a lively 
sense both of the wants of maninastatc 

of 



PREFACE 2,1 

or solitude, and the multiplied happi- 
ness of a social life; another important 
reason why 1 thought proper to depart 
from the old liistory ot liobinson 
Crusoe. 

" I have, therefore, divided the time 
of my New Robinson Crusoe's remain* 
ing upon the island into three periods. 
In the first he is all alone and destitute of 
any European tool or instrument what- 
soever, assisting himself merely by his 
hands and invention; in order to shew, 
on the one hand, how 7 helpless man is 
in a state of solitude, and, on the other, 
how much reflection and persevering 
efforts can contribute to the improve- 
ment of our condition. In the second 
period, I give him a companion, on pur- 
pose to shew how much a man's situa- 
tion t may be bettered by taking even 
this iingle step towards society. Lastly, 

in 



22, PR EI ACL. 

in the third period, a vessel from Europe 
is shipwrecked on his island, and gives 
him an opportunity thereby of provid- 
ing himself with tools and most other 
articles necessary in common life, in 
order that the young reader may see 
how valuable many things are of which 
we are accustomed to make very little 
account, ' because we have never expe- 
rienced the want of them." 



Thus far the French Translator's 
Preface ; which containing a very am- 
ple explanation of the plan and scope 
of the following work, there is little 
necessity to offer any thing in addition 
to what he has said upon that subject. 
It only remains for the English Trans- 
lator to request the indulgence of the 

Public, 



PREFACE. J2J 

Public, n account of the deviations 
which he has taken the liberty to make 
from the original.. Many passages he 
has found himself obliged either to omit 
entirely, or to throw into a new form, 
according as the difference of national 
mannersand character seemed absolutely 
to require it. He hopes, however, that 
this liberty has. never been used unless 
under circumstances of unavoidable ne- 
cessity. For the external form of this 
little work, it is but just to observe, that 
no pains have been spared to embellish 
it, and that the addition of 32 hand- 
some cuts cannot fail of rendering it 
at once more sprightly and intelligible 
to the young reader, for whom it is in- 
tended. In effect, these little prints 
serve admirably to afford the child a just 
conception of the remarkable passages 
in a work; and it may. perhaps, be 

affirmed, 



2\ PREFACE* 

affirmed with truth, that no parts, even 
of the most interesting stories, make a 
stronger or more lasting impression on 
the memory, than those which are the 
subjects of the cuts. 

With these advantages, it is hoped, 
the New Robinson Crusoe will find its 
way to the studies of the )ounger class 
of both sexes, and afford them at once 
both innocent entertainment aad moral 
instruction. 



THF 



THE 



NEW 
ROBINSON CRUSOE 



FIRST EVENING. 



A GENTLEMAN, of the name of 
Billingsley, resided some years ago at 
Twickenham, who, having a pretty large 
family, and but a moderate fortune, deter- 
mined to undertake himself the care of his 
children's education. He proposed, by this 
plan, on the onehand, to avoid the enormous 
expence of keeping them at what are called 
genteel boarding-schools, and, on the other, 
Vol. I. B to 



S6 THE NEW 

to enjoy the pleasing observation of their 
improvement in learning, sense, and good 
behaviour. To remark, u ith silent but at- 
tentive eyes, the gradual advance of his 
children towards the perfection of reason 
and virtue; toassist, withhis advice and in- 
struction, their endeavours to become more 
learned, honest, and wise ; and to have the 
happy consciousness, that he should one 
day be considered, what all parents ought, 
as the instrument and cause of his children's 
eternal welfare ; all this, he thought, would 
be more than a sufficient reward for what- 
ever cares and fatigue he should under- 
go in the course of their education. 

lie, therefore, laid down for them a re- 
gular plan of study, to which he afterwards 
strictly adhered. In this was included a 
course of reading; and some book, that was 
at once both instructive and entertaining, 
afforded them amusement every evening 
for two or three hours beforesupper. Hut, as 
this txcercise Was meant by their father 
solely to increase their fund of knowledge, 

and 



ROBINSON' CRUSOE. 27 

and enlarge their understanding, in order 
that it might appear rather as a relaxation 
from their closer studies, than a labour im- 
posed on them, Mr. Billingsley, in general, 
undertook the task of reading himself. The 
following -history of the New Robinson 
Crusoe was, during some weeks, the sub- 
ject of their evening's entertainment ; and 
was thus introduced. 

Mr. and Mrs. Billinsslev. bein^ seated 
by the parlour fire, together with Mr. Rose 
and Mr. Meredith, two intimate friends of 
the family, and all the children, whose 
names will appear successively in the course 
of the story, being assembled in their pro- 
per places,. Mr. Billingsley began his re- 
lation as follows : 

Mr. Billingsley. Well, my dear chil- 
dren, I have a book for your entertainment 
this evening that contains a very extraor- 
dinary story. Some parts of it will make 
your hair stand on end, and others will 
perfectly delight you. 

B 1 George, 



£8 THE NEW 

George. Ah ! but do not let it be too 
melancholy, papa. 

Harriet. No, my dear papa, not too 
melancholy ; for then it will make us all 
cry, you know. 

Richard. Hold your tongues ; papa 
knows what to read, I warrant you. 

Mr. Bill. Do not be uneasy, my dears, 
I will take care that there shall not be any 
thing: too tragical in it. 

There lived in the town of Exeter a 
person of the name of Crusoe, who follow- 
ed the profession of a' broker. He had 
three sons, the eldest of whom, having an 
inclination to serve in the army, enlisted 
himself as a soldier, went abroad with his 
regiment to Flanders, and was killed at 
the battle of Fontenoy. 

The second entered the University of 
Oxford, and made a considerable progress 
in learning ; but pursuing his studies with 
too much eagerness, he impaired his health 
beyond all possibility of recovering, and 
died of a consumption. 

There 



ROBIXSON CRUSOE. l 29 

There remained, therefore, but the 
youngest, whose name was Robinson. In 
him, as he was now become their only son, 
Mr. and Mrs. Crusoe placed all their hopes 
and expectations. They loved him as the 
apple of their eye, hut their love was blind 
and injudicious. 

Geo. What is the meaning of that, papa? 

Mr. Bill. I will tell you — your mother 
and I love you all, my dear children, as you 
well know; hut for that very reason we 
keep you close at your business every day, 
and teach yon many things both useful and 
agreeable, because we know that to be the 
best way to make you good and happy. 
But Robinson's parents did not act in the 
same maimer. They suffered their dear 
child to do whatever he pleased ; and as this 
dear child liked better to play than to work 
or to learn any thing, they let him play al- 
most the whole day long, by which means 
he learned little or nothing. Now this is 
what we call an injudicious lovein parents. 

Geo. 1 understand now, papa. 

B'3 Mr, 



.'JO THE NEW 

Mr. Bill. Robinson grew up a stout 
stripling- before his parents had determined 
what profession they should give him. Mis 
father was desirous that he should learn 
some trade, but the son had not the least 
inclination that way. He said he should 
like better to travel, to see the world, and 
become acquainted with the various objects 
and customs that foreign countries afford. 

In speaking thus, young Crusoe shewed 
his ignorance and folly. If he had begun 
by laying in a good stock of learning, it 
would have been another matter. But 
what profit could a raw, ignorant boy, like 
him, gain by seeing foreign countries? 
When a man wishes to make his way in the 
world, be it in what country it will, he 
ought to be provided beforehand with a 
tolerable share of knowledge ; but this was 
what Robinson never once thought of. 

lie was now seventeen years of age. The 
greatest part of this time he had mispent in 
sauntering about and playing in the streets 
of Exeter. Every day he was teazing his 

father 



ROBINSON CRUSOE- Si 

father for leave to go and travel. But his 
father told him that he did not know his 
own mind, nor what sort of a request he was 
making arid therefore would not hear a 
word upon the subject. " My dear child, "his 
mother would^say to him, " stick to your 
own country, and never think of rambling." 

One day- 

Harriet. Aha! now it begins. 

'Edw. Pshaw! hold your tongue. 

Mr. Bill. One day, when, according to 
custom, he was strolling about the streets, 
he met one of his old playfellows, whose 
father was captain of a ship trading to Am- 
sterdam, and who had just come down from 
Plymouth to see some of his relations that 
lived at Exeter. He told Robinson that 
he was to set off with his father in a day 
or two for Amsterdam. 

Charlotte. What, papa, by the stage? 

Henry. No, Charlotte, but in a ship; 
for you must cross the sea to go to Am- 
sterdam. Well, papa. 

Mr. Bill. lie asked Robinson if he should

like to go with iiim. " Yes, very well," re- 
plied he, " but my parents will not eon sent 
to it." " Pooh?" said the other, " come o 
with me as you are, just for the frolic. We 
shall he back again in a month or six weeks: 
and as to your lather and mother, you have 
only to let them know where you are gone."'

in pi)' pocket." "You will not want any," 
replied his companion; " but if you shouhi, 
when we arrive at Amsterdam, I'll supply

Young Crusoe hesitated a {'qw moments, 
as if considering what resolution- he should 
take; at last, slapping his companion's 
hand, he cried, "Agreed, my boy! I will 
go along with you: let us set off this mo- 
ment for Plymouth." At the same time he 
commissioned one of his acquaintances to 
let his father know (after the expiration of 
a i^tw hours), that he was only gone to see 
the city of Amsterdam, in Holland, and 
that he should be back in a week Or two.

Edxv. Nor I neither. 

Mr. Rose. Why so, Richard? 

Rich. Because he seems to make nothing 
of leaving his father and mother without 
their permission. 

Mr. Rosa. You are extremely right, 
Richard; he committed there a very rash 
foolish action, and we should pity him for 
his folly. But, thank Heaven, there are 
not many young persons now so ignorant 
as not to know their duty towards their 
parents. 

Edw. What ! are there other boys then 
like Robinson Crusoe? 

Mr. Rose. I have not yet found any ; 
but one thing 1 know for certain, which 
is, that no good can ever come of young 
people who behave like him. 

Rich. Well, let us hear what becomes 
of Robinson. 

Mr. Bill. A short time after Robinson 

and the captain's son were got on board, 

the sailors weighed anchor and set their sails. 

The wind blew fresh, and they cleared out 

115 of 



34 THE NEW 

of the harbour, bidding adieu to Plymouth 
for a short while. Young Crusoe was upon 
the deek with his friend, and almost out of 
his wits with joy that he was at length 
going to begin his travels. 

The evening was fine, and. the breeze 
blew so favourably, that they soon lost sight 
f)f i)\e town and harbour of Plymouth. 
They were now on the open sea, and Ro- 
binson stared with admiration when he saw. 
nothing before him but the sky and the 
water. By degrees they began to lose 
sight of land, and as night came on, they 
could see nothing on that quarter but the 
Eddistone lighthouse. This also disap- 
peared in a short time, and from that 
moment Robinson saw nothing above him 
but the sky, nor before, behind, and all 
round him hut the sea. 

Geo. That must be a prospect. 

Mr. Merecf. It is not impossible but 
you may see such a one before it be long. 

Geo. Oh ! shall we go upon the sea? 

Mr. Mered. If you will be very attentive 

while 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 35 

while you are learning geography, so as 
to know which course you must take to 
go from one place to another. 

Mr. Bill. Yes, and if by working con- 
stantly, and being temperate in your vic- 
tuals, you make your bodies hardy enough 
to bear the fatigue of such a voyage, we, 
may, perhaps, some day in summer, take a 
boat down the river as far as London, 
where some of you have never been yet. 
All the Children. Oh ! oh ! " 
Mr. Bill. I cannot tell but we may take 
a trip to Margate for a few weeks, where 
you will have as wide a prospect of the sea 
as Robinson Crusoe had when he was sail- 
ing out of Plymouth harbour. (Here they 
all get up and run about their father. They 
hang on his neck, his arms, and his knees, 
expressing their joy with caresses, clapping of' 
hinds, and jumping about.) 

Harriet. Will you let me make one of 
the party ? 

Mrs. Bill. Yes, my dear, if you are 
able to go so far. 

B 6 Harriet.

Harriet. But it is very far, is not it pa- 
pa? Perhaps farther than Richmond, where 
Mr. Compton lives, and another- gentle- 
man that has a great house and a large gar- 
den — oh ! so large ! a great deal larger 
than our garden. I was all through it, 
was not I, papa? the day that Charlotte and 
I were gathering cowslips in the meadow. 
Mr. Bill. Yes, I rememher, and we 
were looking at the folks plowing. 

Harriet. Yes, and we went into a smith's 
forge that was by the road's side. 

Mr. Bill. And afterwards up into a 
windmill. 

Harriet. Ah, yes, where the wind blew 
off my bonnet. 

Mr. Bill. Which the miller's boy brought 
back to you again. 

Harriet. That was a good boy; was 
not he, papa? 

Mr. Bill. Yes, he was a good boy for 
being so obliging as. to do us a kindness, 
though he had never seen us before. 

Harriet. 



ROBINSON. CRUSOE. 37 

Harriet. However, you gave him some- 
thing, -I suppose. 

Mr. Bill. Certainly, my dear, I gave 
him something; for everyone likes to re- 
ward those that are obliging — But we for- 
get Robinson Crusoe. We must make haste 
to overtake him, or else we shall lose sight - 
of him, for he is going at a furious rate. 

For two days they had constantly good 
weather, and a favourable wind. The 
third day the sky was darkened with clouds, 
the wind blew with uncommon violence, 
and the air grew every moment darker 
and darker. 

In short, it was a dreadful storm. At 
one time the lightning flashed as if the 
sky was on fire; then succeeded a pitchy 
darkness, like that of midnight, with claps 
of thunder which they thought would 
never end. The rain came down in floods, 
and the violence of the wind tossed the 
sea about in such a manner that the waves 
swelled and rose mountains high. 

Then it would have been worth while to 

see 



58 THE NEV/ 

see how the ship went see-saw. One time 
a large wave carried ir, as it were, up to 
the clouds; another time it dipped down 
as if n was going to the bottom of the 
deep; then it rolled to one side and the 
other, and UV down so flat that at times 
its very masts seemed to touch the water. 
What a noise was amongst the ropes ! 
what a clattering upon the deck ! The 
sailors were obi ged, each of them, to hold 
fast to something or other for fear of being 
washed overboard. Ho bins >u Crusoe, who 
had never been accustomed to all this, 
grew giddy, felt a sickness at Ins stomach, 
and was so bad that he thought he should 
have vomitted to- death. They call it sea- 
sickness. 

Rich. That is what he has gained by 
running away. 

Mr. Bill. " Oh ! niv poor parents ! my 
poor father and mother !■" cried in- inces- 
santly ; "they Miii never see me more! 
Oh miserable fool that I am to have 
brought this affliction on them !" 

Crack » 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 39 

Crack ! went something on the deck. 
" Heaven have mercy on us ;" cried the 
, sailors, turning as pale as death, and clasp- 
ing their hands together. "What is die 
matter?" asked Robinson, . who was half 
dead with affright. 

"Ah! we are all lost! answered one 
of the seamen ; " the lightning has shiver- 
ed our mizen-mast to pieces,? (that is, the 
hindmost of the three masts that are in a 
ship,) "and the main-mast stands by so 
slender a hold that we must cut it down 
and throw it overboard." 

"We are all lost!"cried out another voice 
from below; " the ship has sprung a leak, 
and there are four feet water in the hold." 

Af these words Robinson, who was sitting 
clown on the cabin floor, fell backwards 
void of sense and motion. All the rest ran to 
the pumps, in order, if possible, to keep the 
vessel afloat. At last, one of the sailors came 
and shook Robinson by the shoulder, ask- 
ing him if he intended to be the only one 
who would do nothing for the preservation 

of 



AO THE UtW 

of the ship, but lie there stretched at his 

length while all the rest of the people 
worked until they were not able to stand. 

He tried, therefore, to rise, weak as he 
was, and took his place at one of the pumps. 
In the mean time the captain ordered some 
guns to be fired as a signal of distress to 
other ships, if there should happen to be 
any within hearing capable of assisting 
them. Robinson, who did not know die 
meaning of these shots, thought the vessel 
was splitting in pieces, and fainted away 
again. One of the sailors, who took his 
place at the pump, pushed him on one side 
with his foot, and left him there stretched 
at full length, imagining that he was dead. 

They pumped with all their strength ; 
nevertheless the water still gained upon 
them in the hold, and now they only wait- 
ed for the moment when the vessel would 
sink. In order to lighten her, they threw 
overboard every tiling that they could pos- 
sibly spare, as the guns, bales of goods 

hogs- 



R03INS0N CRUSOE. 4*1 

hogsheads, &c. But all that was of no 
manner of service. 

However, another ship had heard their 
signals of distress, and, as the storm began 
about this time to abate considerably, ven- 
tured to send out her boat, in order, if possi- 
ble, to save the crew. But the boat could 
not come near, the waves running too high. 
At length, however, they came near enough 
to throw a rope to the people who we're on 
board, by means of which they towed the 
boat close under the ship's stern, and then 
every one who could make use of his legs 
eagerly jumped into it. Robinson, who 
could not stand upon his, was tumbled in 
hastily by some of the seamen more com- 
passionate than the rest. 

They had hardly rowed many minutes, 
before the ship, which was still pretty near 
them, sunk before their eyes. Happily the 
storm was now almost totally abated, 
otherwise the waves would inevitably have 
swallowed up the boat, which was then as 
full of people as it could hold. After many 

dangers 



42 THE NEW 

dangers it got safe at length to the ship, 
where they were all taken in. 

Geo. Ah ! well, 1 am glad, however, 
that the poor people were not drowned. 

Edw. I was sadly in pain for them. 

Harriet. Well, this will teach master 
Robinson never to be so naughty again. 

Mrs. Bill. That is just my opinion too. 
Let us hope that he will be the better for 
this clanger. 

Henry. Well, what became of him 
after ? 

Mr. Bill. The ship that had taken him 
and the rest of the crew in, was bound to 
London. In four days she arrived at the 
Nore, and the next dav came to anchor 
in the river. 

Charlotte. What is the Nore, papa? 

Mr. Bill. The Nore is a small sandy 
bank at the mouth of the Thames, where a 
vessel is constantly stationed, which hangs 
up two lights every night to be a guide to 
ships that enter the river. 

They now landed, and happy was each 

one 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 4S 

one to have thus escaped the dangers of the 
sea. As to Robinson, his first care was to see 
London, and for this purpose he spent a 
day or two in rambling all over the city, 
■where he met with such a variety of new 
objects as entirely put the remembrance of 
past dangers out of his head, as well as all 
thoughts of the future. Happening one 
day to meet the captain with whom he had 
set sail from Plymouth, he received an in- 
vitation to dine with him, which was very 
agreeable to Robinson, as he had spent 
what little money he had borrowed from the 
captain's son, and his pocket now was not 
able to afford him a single meal. At din- 
ner the captain asked him what particular 
motive he had forgoing to Amsterdam, and 
what he intended to have done there. Ro- 
binson answered him frankly, that he had 
nothing in view but his amusement : that 
he had come off unknown to his father and 
mother, and at present did not know what 
to do with himself. 

" Unkno wn to your father and mother ! " 

cried 



44 THE NEW 

cried the captain, laying down his knife 
and fork: " Good heavens! why did not I 
know that before? Believe me; imprudent 
young man, if I had known so much at 
Plymouth, I would not have taken you 
on hoard of my ship, if you had offered me 
a million of money." 

Robinson sat with down-cast eyes blush- 
ing for shame, and unable to answer a sin- 
gle word. 

Thehonestcaptain continued to represent 
to him the folly that he had been guilty of, 
and told him that he could never be happy 
unless he' repented of what he had done, 
and obtained forgiveness of his parents. At 
these words Robinson wept bitterly. 

" But what can I do now?*' cried he 
at length, sobbing heavily. " What can you 
do ? said the captain, " Return to your 
parents, fall on your knees before them 
and, like a sensible and dutiful lad, implore 
their pardon for your imprudence : that is 
What you can do, and what you ought to 
do/' " 

Harriet. 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 45 

Harriet. Ah, papa, I like this captain 
much; he was a very good man. 

Mr. Bill. My dear, he did what every 
one ought to do when he sees his fellow- 
creature fall into an error; he endeavoured 
to bring this young man back to his duty. 

" Will you take me with you to Ply- 
mouth again?" said Robinson. 

" Who, I ?" said the captain : " Have 
you forgot, then, that my ship is lost ; I 
may be a considerable time before I return 
there in a ship of my own : but as for you 
there is not a moment to lose : you should 
go aboard of the very first vessel that sails 
for Plymouth, if it were even to-day. 

" But," says Robinson, ? I have no mo- 
ney." 

" Well," said the honest captain, " I 
will lend you a couple of guineas out of the 
little that I have to spare. Go down to 
the river, and get aboard of some vessel that 
is bound for Plymouth, unless you rather 
chuse to travel by land. If your repen- 
tance is sincere, God will bless your return 

and 



46 THE NEW 

and make it happier than your outset has 
been." With these words, having made 
an end of dinner, he shook Robinson by 
the hand and wished him a good voyage, 
who parted from him witlAnany thanks for 
his kindness and good advice. 

Edzv. What, is he going back home 
again already ? I thought the story was 
only beginning. 

Mrs. Bill. Are not you satisfied, then, 
my dear Edward, that he should go home 
to his parents, and put an end to the sorrow 
and distress that they suffer on his account? 

Mr. Mered. And are you not pleased to 
^find that he sees his error, and is willing to 
make amends for it? 

Edzv. Yes — that — to be sure. But I 
thought to hear something diverting before 
it came to that. 

Mr. Bill. Well, he is not returned home 
yet. Let us hear the remainder of his ad- 
ventures. 

- Wink he-was walking down towards the 
river, his head was filled with various re- 
flections. 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 47 

flections. " What will my- father and mo- 
ther say," -thought he to himself, "if I 
go back to them now? Certainly they will 
punish me for what I have done. And then 
all my companions, and every one else that 
hears of it, what game they will make o^ 
me for returning so soon, after seeing only 
two or three streets of London !." 

This thought made him stop short. One 
moment he seemed determined not to go 
home yet; again, he reflected on what the 
captain had told him, that he would never 
be happy unless he returned to his parents. 
For a long time he was at a loss what to re- 
solve on. At length, however, he went 
down to the river; but there he learned, 
to his great satisfaction, that there was not 
a single vessel in the river bound for Ply> 
mouth. The person who gave him this in* 
formation was a captain of a ship in thja 
African trade, who was shortly to set sail 
for the coast of Guinea, : 

Charlotte* Where is the coast of Guinea, 
papa ? 



48 THE NEW 

Mr. Bill. Henry can tell you that; he 
knows where it lies. 

Henri). Don't you remember there is a 
country called Africa? Very well ; one part 
of the coast 

Charlotte. Coast ! What is that ? 

Henry. The land that lies along by the 
sea-side. Hold, here's Fenning's Geo<n«i- 
phy : look at this little map. All this part 
of Africa that turns down here is called the 
coast of Guinea. 

Mr. Bill. And English ships sail to this 
coast in order to trade there. The person 
who spoke with Robinson was captain of 
one of those ships. 

When he found that the young man had 
so eager a desire for travelling, and would 
have been sorry to return so soon to Ply- 
mouth, he proposed to him to take a trip to 
the coast of Guinea. Robinson at first was 
startled at the idea : but when the captain 
assured him that the voyage would be ex- 
ceeding pleasant; that, so far from costing 
him any thing, it might turn out a very 

profitable 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 49 

profitable adventure ; Robinson's eyes be- 
gan to sparkle, and his passion for travelling- 
revived in bis breast with such force that 
he immediately forgot every advice which 
the honest Plymouth captain had given 
him, and all the good resolutions that he 
himself had taken butsoshort a time before. 

" But, " said he, after considering a 
while within himself, " I have only two 
guineas in the world ; what use can I make 
of so small a sum in trading at the place 
that you mention? " 

" I will lend you five more, " said the 
captain ; " that will be quite sufficient to 
purchase you goods, which, if we have but 
tolerable success, may make your fortune. " 

" And what sort of goods must I pur- 
chase ? " said Robinson. 

" All sorts of toys and playthings, " an- 
swered the captain ; "glass beads, knives, 
scissars, hatchets, ribbands, guns, &c. of 
which the negroes of Africa are so fond 
that they will give you a hundred times 
the value in gold, ivory, and other things. '* 

Vol. I. C Robinson 



.50 THE NEW 

Robinson was not able to contain himself 
for joy. He forgot, at once, his parents, 
friends, and country. " Captain, " said he, 
u I am willing to go along with you when 
you please. " 

" Agreed ! *• replied the other, taking 
him by the hand, and thus the matter was 
settled. 

RicJi. Well, now it is all over; I shall 
never have the least pity any more for such 
a blockhead as Robinson, whatever misfor- 
tunes may happen to him. 

Mr. Bill. No pity, Richard ? 

Rich. No, papa : why is he such a fool 
as to forget a second time his duty to his 
parents? Providence, no doubt, will pu- 
nish him afresh for it. 

Mr. Bill. And do you think that a man 
deserves no pity who is unfortunate enough 
to forget his parents, and to draw down 
upon himself the chastisement of Heaven? 
I granthe is himself the cause of every thing 
that happens to him ; but is not he for that 
very reason so much the more unfortunate ? 

Oh! 



110 BIN SON CRUSOE. 5 I 

Oh ! my dear child, may Heaven preserve 
you and every one of us from that most 
terrible of all punishments, to feel that we 
alone have caused our own wretchedness! 
But whenever we hear of such an unfortu- 
nate person, we should consider that he is 
our brother, our poor deluded brother? 
we should shed over him tears of compas- 
sion, and offer up to Heaven the prayers 
of brotherly love in his behalf. 

All were silent for a few moments; 
after which Mr. Billingsley continued in 
the following words : 

Robinson made haste to lav out his se- 
yen guineas. He purchased with them 
such articles as the captain had mentioned 
to him, and had them carried on board. 

After some days, the wind being fa- 
vourable, the captain weighed anchor, and 
they set sail. 

Henry, What course should they hold 
to arrive at Guinea. 

Mr. Bill, Here, you have Fenning's 

Geography: I should think you cannot be at 

a loss to know, as you pointed out to your 

C 2 sister 



32 THE NEW 

sister the coast of Guinea just now. How- 
ever, I will shew you their course. You see, 
from London here theygodown theThames, 
and come into the Downs. Afterwards 
they steer West, through the British Chan- 
nel, and enter the great Atlantic Ocean, 
in which they continue their course here- 
close by the Canary Islands, and so past 
the Cape Verd Islands, until at last they 
land hereabouts on the coast of Guinea. 

Henry, But at what particular spot 
will they land? 

Mr. Bill. Perhaps there, near Cape 
Coast castle. 

Mrs. Bill. Well, now I think it is high 
time for us to set sail towards the land of 
supper. What think ye, Children? 

Geo. I am not the least hungry, mamma. 

Harriet. And I would rather hear the 
story too. 

Mr. Bill. To-morrow, my dears, to- 
morrow evening we shall have the rest of 
Robinson's adventures. At present we 
will put him by and prepare for supper. 

SECOND 



KOB[NSON CRUSOE. 

SECOND EVENING, 



THE next evening the whole company 
having taken their places as before, Mr. 
Billingsley continued his story in the fol- 
lowing terms. 

Robinson's second voyage began as fa- 
vourably as the first. They had already 
cleared the Channel without any accident, 
and were now in the middle of the Atlantic 
Ocean ; here they met with such contrary 
winds for several days successively, that 
they found themselves driven a consider- 
able way towards the coast of America. 

Here, my dear children, I have brought 
you a large map which will shew you 
much better than a small one the course 
which the ship should have held, and that 
which the wind obliged her to take. They 
wanted to steer down all along this way, so; 
but because they had a side wind from that 
quarter, they were driven in spite of them- 
selves, towards this part, where you see 
C 3 America 



54 THE NEW 

America lie. I will lay it down here on 
the table that we may all cast our eyes 
upon it whenever there is occasion. 

One evening* the steersman declared that 
he saw a fire at a great distance, and that 
he heard the firing of guns from the same 
quarter. All hands immediately hastened 
upon deck, where they both saw the fire 
and could distinctly hear the report of se- 
veral guns. The captain examined his 
maps, and found there was no land on that 
quarter within the distance of a hundred 
leagues; and they all unanimously con- 
cluded that what they saw could be no- 
thing else but a ship on lire. 

It was immediately resolved to assist 
the vessel in distress, and they accordingly 
steered that way. In a very short trine 
their conjectures were verified ; for they 
beheld a large ship all in flames, and burn- 
ins: with the greatest firry. 

The captain instantly ordered five guns 
to be fired as a signal to the poor people 
who were on board the burning s/iip, that 

help 



2 




ROBIKSOX CRUSOE. 55 

help was at hand. Scarcely was this order 
put in execution, before they saw, with ter- 
ror and astonishment, the ship which had 
been on fire blow up with a dreadful ex- 
plosion; and immediately after everything 
sunk and the fire was seen no more. It is 
to be observed, that the flames had, at 
length, reached the powder room, and this 
was the cause of the ship's blowing up. 

Nobody could tell as yet what was be- 
come of the poor people belonging to her. 
There was a possibility that they might 
have taken to their boats before the vessel 
blew up: for which reason the captain 
continued firing guns the whole night, in 
order to inform them on what quarter the 
ship was that desired to assist them. He 
also ordered all the lanterns to be hung 
out, that they might have a chance of 
seeing the ship in the night time. 

At break of day they discovered, by 

means of their glasses, two boats full of 

people, tossing about at the mercy of. the 

waves. They could perceive that the 

C 4 wind 



$6 THE NEW 

wind was against them, but that they rowed 
with all their foree towards the ship. Im- 
mediately the captain ordered the colours 
to be hoisted as a signal that he saw their 
distress, and was ready to relieve them. 
At the same time the ship. made all the sail 
possible towards them, and in the space of 
half an hour happily came up with them. 

There were sixty in the boats, men, 
women and children, who were all taken 
on board. It was an affecting scene to 
behold the actions of these poor people 
when they saw themselves so happily de- 
livered. Some sobbed and wept for joy, 
others lamented as if their danger was but 
just begun ; some jumped about upon the 
deck as if they had lost their wits, others we re 
wringing their hands, and as pale as death; 
several of them were laughing lirke mad 
people, and danced and shouted for joy; 
others, on the contrary, stood stock-still 
as if speechless and insensible, and could 
not utter a single word. 

Sometimes one or two amongst them fell 

on 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 67 

on their knees, lifted up their hands to 
Heaven, and with a loud voice returned 
thanks to God, whose providence had so 
miraculously saved them from perishing. 

Some of them again would start up, 
dance about like children, teartheir cloaths, 
cry and fall down in fainting fits, from 
which tlrey could with difficulty be reco- 
vered. There was none of the ship's crew> 
though ever so hardened, that could help 
shedding tears at the sight of these poor 
people's extravagant behaviour. 

Among them happened to be a young- 
priest, who acted with more firmness and 
dignity than any of the rest. As soon as 
he set his foot upon the deck, he fell upon 
his face, and seemed to have lost all sense 
and motion. The captain went to assist 
him, thinking that he had swooned away; 
but the clergyman calmly thanked him for 
his good-nature, '.and said, " Allow me first 
to return thanks to my Creator, for our de- 
liverance; I will afterwards endeavour to 
shew you how lively a sense I entertain of 
C 5 your 



58 THE NEW 

your extreme kindness to us." Upon this 
the captain politely withdrew. 

The priest remained a few minutes in this 
posture of humble prostration; after which, 
rising cheerfully, he went to the captain to 
testify his gratitude to him for the civility 
that he had shewn to him and his people, 
This done, he turned to his companions in 
misfortune and said, " My dear friends* 
•calm the agitation of your minds. The 
Being who is supremely good, hath vouch- 
safed to stretch out a father's hand over 
you. You should lift up your hearts to 
him, and thank him without delay for t-he 
unexpected preservation of your lives." 
There were several of them who acted in 
conformity to his exhortations, and im- 
mediatejy began to return thanks to Hea- 
ven with fervour and devotion. 

After this the priest gave the captain an 
account who they were, and what had 
happened to them. 

The ship that was burnt was a large 
French merchantman, bound for Quebec 

— Here, 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 59 

— Here, you see, this spot in America. — 
The fire broke out in the sail room, and 
burned with such rapidity as baffled all 
their endeavours to stop it. They had 
barely time to fire some guns as signals of 
their distress, and then to take to their boats, 
uncertain of the destiny that awaited the'm. 
The most likely prospect before them in 
that moment of horror was, that, upon the 
least swell of the sea, the waves would swal- 
low up them and their boats, or else that 
they must perish with hunger, as they had' 
-been able to save nothing from the ship 
on fire but a small quantity of biscuit and 
water, sufficient for a few days. 

Charlotte. What occasion had they to 
carry water with them ? They were on the 
water. 

Mr. Bill. You forget, my dear Char- 
lotte, that the water of the sea is salt and 
unfit for drinking. 

Charlotte. §o, so ! 

Mr. Bill In this distressful situation they 

heard the guns that were fired by the Eng- 

C6 lish 



CO THE NEW 

lish ship, and soon after observed fcfie light 
of their lanterns. They passed all that 
Ibng and dismal' flight between hope and 
fear, exerting* all their strength to get to 
the ship, but continually driven back by 
the winds and waves. At length, however, 
the long-wished-for appearance of day put 
an end to their distress. 

Robinson all this time had been filled 
with the most dreadful reflections. " Hea- 
vens 1" said he to himself, " if these people, 
amongst whom there are certainly many 
good and devout persons, have suffered so 
great distress, what must not I expect, 
who have acted with so much ingratitude 
towards my poor parents!" This thought 
lay heavy at his heart. Pale and silent, 
like one whose conscience is not good, he 
sat in a corner, with his hands clasped to- 
gether, and scarcely daring even to pray, 
because he feared lest God would have no 
regard to his prayers. 

The people who were saved from the 
boats, and were almost exhausted with fa- 
tigue, 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 6l 

tigue, had now taken some refreshment, 
when their captain, holding* a large purse 
full of money in his hand, came up to the 
ship's captain, and told him that whatever 
money they had been able to save from their 
ship was in that purse, which he begged 
him to accept as a slight mark of the gra- 
titude which they all entertained towards 
him for the preservation of their lives. 

"God forbid," answered the captain, 
"that I should accept your offers ! I have 
done no more than humanity required of 
me, and I am convinced that you would 
have done the same thing if you had been 
in our place, and we in yours." 

In vain did the Frenchman press him to 
accept the purse; the captain persisted in 
refusing it, and begged him to say no more 
about it. — It was now debated where they 
should laud the people that had been saved. 
To carry them to Guinea did not appear ad- 
visable for two reasons. In the first place, 
why should those poor people be ^obliged 
io make so long a voyage to a country 

where 



G% THE NEW 

where they had not the least business in the 
world? And besides there were not provi- 
sions enough aboard for so many people to 
hold out until they should arrive at Guinea. 

At length the captain generously re- 
solved to go a hundred leagues out of his 
■wayfoi* the sake of these poor people, and 
to carry them to Newfoundland, where 
they might have an opportunity of return- 
in^ to France in some of the ships em- 
ployed in the cod fishery. 

Harriet. What is that? 

Rich. Do not you remember what papa 
has told us about the cod fish ; how they 
come down from the North seas to the very 
banks of Newfoundland, where people fish 
for them and catch them in such quantities? 

Harriet. Oh, yes! now I recollect. 

Rich. Look here on the map: this is 
Newfoundland up here, near to America, 
and those dotted spots are the banks where 
they fish for the cod. 

JUr. Bill. To Newfoundland,- therefore, 
they. bent their course; and as it happened 

to 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. ' 63 

to be the middle of the fishing season, they 
found several French vessels there, which 
took on board the people of the ship that 
had blown up. Their gratitude to the 
English captain was too great to be ex- 
pressed in words. 

As lie had now, therefore, conducted 
them to ships of their own nation, he re- 
turned wit li a favourable wind, in order to 
continue his own voyage to the coast, of 
Guinea. The ship cut the waves with the 
swiftness of a bird that wings its airy way 
through the skies, and in a short time they 
had sailed some hand red leagues. This 
was what Robinson Crusoe liked; things 
never could go too fast for him, as he was 
of a restless, unsettled disposition. 

Their course now was mostly directed to 
the Southward. One day as tlfey were steer- 
ing in that direction, they perceived alarge 
ship making up towards them. Presently 
after they heard them fire some guns of dis- 
tress, and could discern that they had lost 
their foremast and their bowsprit. 

Edxv. 



64f THE NEW 

Edie. Bowsprit? What is that? 

Mr. BUI. Why surely, you cannot have 
forgot what that is. 

Ediv. Ah ! right ! It is a little mast that 
does not stand straight up like the rest, 
but comes out sloping, so, from the fore- 
part of the ship. 

Mr. BL'l. Very well, They steered their 
course towards the ship that was in dis- 
tress, and when they were within hearing 
of each other, the people aboard of her 
cried out, " For Heaven's sake have com- 
passion on us, and save our lives ! We are 
at the last extremity, and must perish if 
you do not relieve us*" 

The captain, therefore, asked them in 
what consisted their distress; when one 
of their number answered thus: 

u We are Englishmen, bound for the 
French Island of Marfciuieo.-' — See, chil- 
dren; here it lies in the West Indies — 
" We took in a cargo of coffee there; and 
while we were lying at anchor, and just 
ready to depart, oar captain and mate, with 

most 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 65 

most of the ship's crew, went ashore one 
clay to get in a few things for the ship's 
use. In their absence, there arose so vio- 
lent a storm that our cable was broke, and 
we were driven out from the harbour into 
the open sea. The hurricane" 

Geo. What is that papa ? 

Mr. Bill. It is a kind of wirlwind occa* 
sioued by many winds blowing from diffe- 
rent quarters, one against the other. *• 

«' The hurricane," continued he, "blew 
furiously three days and three nights. We 
lost our masts, and were driven some hun- 
dreds of leagues out to sea. Unfortunately 
we are most of us passengers, with but one 
seaman and a boy or two on board to work 
the ship ; so that for nine weeks we have 
been driven about at the mercy of the 
winds and Waves : all our provisions are 
gone, and many of us are, at this moment, 
dying with hunger." 

Immediately the good captain ordered 
out his boat, took some provisions, and went 

aboard 



66 THE NEW % 

aboard the ship, accompanied by Robinson 
Crusoe. 

They found the crew reduced to the 
most deplorable condition possible : they 
all looked as if they were starved, and many 
of them could hardly stand. But when 
they went into the cabin — Heavens! what 
a shocking spectacle they beheld ! A mo- 
ther, with her son and ayoung maid servant? 
were stretched on the floor, and, to all ap- 
pearance, starved to death. The mother, 
already quitest iff, was sittingon the ground 
between two chairs tied together, with her 
face leaning against one of the planks of the 
ship's side. The maid servant was stretched 
at her length beside her mistress, and had 
one of her arms clasped round the foot of 
the table. As to the young man, he was 
laid upon a bed, and had still in his mouth 
a piece of a leather glove, of which he had 
gnawed away the greatest part. 

Harriet. Oh! papa, what a shocking ac- 
count this is ! 

Mr. 



ltOBIXSON CRUSOE. 67 

Mr. Bill. Right — I bad forgot that you 
did not wish to hear any thing melancholy. 
Well then, I will pass by this story. 

All. Oh no! oh no! Dear papa, let us 
have the whole of it now. 

Mr. Bill. As you please. I must tell 
you then, in the first place, who thtte 
poor people were that lay stretched in thi s 
deplorable manner. 

They were coming passengers in this 
ship from America to England. The whole 
crew said that they were very worthy peo- 
ple. The mother was so remarkably fond 
of her son, that she refused all manner of 
nourishment purposely that her son might 
have something to eat, and this excellent 
young man had clone the same things in 
older to reserve every thing for h'is mother- 
The faithful maid servant was more con- 
cerned for her master and mistress than for 
lie i self. 

They were thought to be dead, all 
three, but, on examination, appeared to 
have some remains of life; for, after a few 

drops 



68 THE NEW 

drops of broth had been forced into their 
months, they began, by degrees, to open 
their eyes. But the mother was now too 
weak to swallow any thing; and she made 
signs that they should confine their attem 
tion to her son. In effect, she expired a 
fotv minutes after. 

The other two were brought to them- 
selves by the force of cordials, and as they 
-were in the flower of their age, the captain, 
by his attentive care, succeeded in restor- 
ing them to life. But when the young man 
turned his eyes upon his mother, and saw 
that she was dead, the shock made him fall 
again into a swoon, from which it was very 
difficult to recover him. However, they 
were fortunate enough to bring him to his 
senses again, and he was, in a short time, 
perfectly re-established ; as was also the 
servant maid. 

The captain furnished the ship in dis- 
tress with all the provisions that he could 
possibly spare ; he ordered his carpenter to 
put up masts for them in the room of those

ROBINSON CRUSOE. 6$ 

tint had been broken, and gave the crew 
proper instructions for conveying them- 
selves to the nearest land, which was that 
of the Madeira Islands. He bent his course 
thither also, on purpose to take in more 
provisions. 

One of these islands, you know, is called 
Madeira, from which the rest take their 
name. 

Henry. Yes, I know it; they belong to 
the Portuguese. 

Rich. From them the fine Madeira wine 
comes ; does it not? 

Geo. And the sugar canes. 

Mr. Bill. The same. At this island the 
captain cast anchor ; and Robinson went 
ashore with him in the afternoon. 

He could never sufficiently admire the 
beautiful prospect which this fertile isle af- 
fords. As far as his eyes could see, the 
mountains were all covered with vines. 
How his mouth watered at the sight of the 
delicious grapes that hung on them ; and 
how did he regale himself when the cap- 
tain 



70 THE HEW 

tain paid for him that he might have 
leave to eat his till ! 

They understood, from those who were 
in the vineyards, that in making wine they 
did not press the grapes here in a wine 
press, as they do in other countries. 

Geo. How then ? 

Mr. Bill, They tumble the grapes into 
a large tub, and then tread upon them with 
their feet, or bruise them with ther elbows. 

Harriet. Oh fie ! I shall not like to 
drink Madeira wine for the future. 

Rich. Now I should not like to drink It 
if it were even made with the wine press. 

Charlotte. Why ? 

Rich. Ah ! you were not here when papa 
shewed us that wine is not good for young 
people. If you were to know all the harm 
that it can do them ! 

Charlotte. Is he in earnest, papa ? 

Mr. Bill. Yes, my dear; nothing can 
be more true. Children that drink wine 
or other strong liquors, often become weak 
and silly. 

Charlotte- 



ROBINSON CRVS0E. 71 

Charlotte. Gracious! I'll never drink 
wine any more. 

Mr. Bill. You will act very wisely, my 
clear. 

As the captain was obliged to stop here 
sometime to repair his ship, which had re- 
ceived a little damage, poor Robinson, at 
the end of a few days, began to grow tired 
of his situation. His restless temper want- 
ed some change, and he wished to have 
wings, that he might fly all over the world 
in as short a time as possible. 

Just at this interval arrived a Portuguese 
ship that .came from Lisbon, and was bound 
for Brazil, in South America. 

Henry (pointing to the map). Is it not 
this country here, belonging to the Portu- 
guese, and where so much gold-dust and 
precious stones are found ? 

Mr. Bill. The very same. 

Robinson got acquainted with the cap- 
tain of this ship, and hearing him talk of 
gold-dust and precious stones, he would 
have given the world to make a voyage to 

Brazil, 



72 THE NEW 

Brazil, where he thought he should fill his 
pockets with diamonds. 

Edzv. He did not know, I suppose, that 
in that country nobody dares to gather 
gold-dust or precious stones, which are the 
sole property of the king of Portugal. 

Mr. Bill. And the reason that he did 
not know was, because when lie was young 
he would never learn any thing. 

Finding, therefore, that the Portuguese 
captain was disposed to take him along with 
him as one of Ins crew, and that the Eng- 
lish ship would be obliged to stop at least 
a fortnight longer, he could not resist his 
desire of rambling. He, therefore, told his 
good friend, the English captain, bluntly 
that he was going to leave him, and to take 
a voyage to Brazil. The captain, who had 
learned from Robinson himself, a short time 
before, that he was rambling thus about 
the world without the knowledge or con- 
sent of his parents, was glad to get rid of 
him. He agreed to take Robinson's venture, 
which consisted of toys and hardware, for 

the 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 73 

the money that he had lent him in Eng- 
land, and gave him besides all manner of 
srood advice. 

Robinson, therefore, went aboard the 
Portuguese ; and now behold him sailing 
for Brazil. They passed pretty near the 
island of TenerifF. 

Harriet. Where that high mountain is 
to be seen, called the Peak of TenerifF; 
eh, papa ? 

Rich, Aye, aye, don't interrupt. 

Mr Bill. It was an admirable prospect, 
even long after sun-set in the evening, when 
all the sea was covered with gloomy dark- 
ness, to see the top of that mountain, one 
of the highest in the whole world, shine 
with the rays of the sun as if it had been 
all on fire. 

Some days after they saw another sight 
upon the sea, which was very agreeable. A 
large number of flying fishes rose upon the 
surface of the water. They glistened likepo- 
lished silver, so that they threw forth astrong 
light from their bodies, as it were in rays. 

Vol. I. D Charlotte. 



74- TJIE NEW 

Charlotte. What, are there fishes that 
fly? 

Mr. Bill. Yes, Charlotte; and I think, 
on a certain day, you and I saw one. 

Geo. Ah, yes ; that was when we were 
in town last Whitsuntide : but for all that, 
papa, it had neither feathers nor wings v 

Mr. Bill. But it had a couple of long 
fms, which serve it as wings when it rises 
above the surface of the water. 

For several days successively the voyage 
was as fine as possible ; but all of a sudden 
a violent hurricane arose from the South- 
east. The waves frothed and rose moun- 
tain high, tossing the vessel to and fro. 
This dreadful storm continued for six days 
successively, and carried the ship so far out 
of her way, that neither the captain nor 
any person on board knew where they were. 
However, by their reckoning,they supposed 
that they could not be far from the Ca- 
ribbee Islands. They lie hereabouts. 

The seventh morning, exactly at day- 
break, one of the sailors threw the whole 

crew 



* K0BINSON CRUSOE. 75 

crew into a fit of extravagant joy, by cry- 
ing out from the mast head, Land ! 

Mrs. Bill. This call comes very season- 
ably, for supper is almost ready in the next 
room. To-morrow we shall hear the rest. 

Geo. O dear mamma, only let us hear 
how they landed, and what happened to 
them afterwards. I should be contented 
with a bit of dry bread, if papa would but 
go on. 

Mr. Bill. Well, my dear, as your mam- 
ma only says that supper is almost ready, 
perhaps there may be a few minutes to 
spare. If she will indulge you until sup- 
per is quite ready, I am content. 

Mrs. Bill. I have no objection : so that 
you may go on until I call you, which 
shall be when every thing is perfectly 
ready. 

All the children. Oh ! that will do. That 
is charming ! 

Mr. Bill. To proceed, therefore, with 
my story : 

The whole crew hastened upon deck to 
D2 see 



76 THE NEW 

see what land this was: but in the verv 
moment their joy was changed into terror 
and consternation ; the ship struck, and 
all those who were upon the deck received 
so violent a shock as almost to throw them 
backwards. 

Rich. What was the matter ? 

Mr. Bill. The ship had run upon a sand- 
bank, and stuck fast as suddenly as if it 
had been nailed to the spot. Then the 
foaming waves dashed over the deck with 
such violence, that they were all obliged to 
take refuge in the cabin and between decks, 
for fear of being: carried overboard. 

Nothing was nowto beheardamongstthe 
crewbut lamentable cries, groans,and sighs, 
that would have softened a heart of stone. 
Some were praying, others wept aloud ; 
some tore their hair like people in despair, 
others were half dead, and stupidly insen- 
sible. Amongst this last class was Robin- 
son Crusoe, who was literally more dead 
than alive. 

Suddenly some one cried out that the 

ship 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. | 77 

ship had split. These dreadful tidings 
brought them alt to new life. They ran 
hastily upon deck, lowered the boat as fast 
as possible, and all jumped into it with the 
most precipitate haste. 

But there were now so many people in 
the boat, that its sides were scarcely four 
inches above the water. The land was still 
far off, and the storm so violent, that every 
one thought it impossible to reach the 
shore. Nevertheless, they exerted their 
whole strength in rowing, and fortunately 
the wind drove them towards land. All at . 
once they beheld a wave, mountain high, 
rolling towards the boat. 

At this dreadful sight the whole crew sat 
motionless, and dropped their oars.Thehuge 
wave strikes the boat, oversets it, and all are 
at once swallowed up in the enraged deep ! 

Here Mr. Billingsley made a stop ; the 
whole company remained silent, and many 
of them could not help sighing with com- 
passion for the fate of the poor seamen. At 
length Mrs. Billingsley arriving with the 
D 3 news 



78 THE NEW 

news that supper was ready, put an end to 
these melancholv ideas. 



THIRD EVENING. 

CxEORGE, Dear papa, is poor Robinson 
Crusoe lost for good ? Is he dead ? 

Mr. Bill. We left him last night in the 
most imminent danger of losinghis life, the 
boat being overset. 

Robinson was swallowed up in the sea 
along with the rest of the ship's company ; 
but the same wave, that dreadful wave, 
which had buried him in the deep, at its 
return drew him along with it, and dashed 
him towards the shore. He was thrown 
with such violence upon a piece of a rock 
that the pain occasioned by the jolt roused 
him from the state of almost insensibility 
that he was in before. He opened his eyes, 

and 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 

and seeing himself, contrary to all expecA 
tation, upon dry ground, he exerted the 
last efforts of his strength to gain the top 
of the beach. 

He reached it at length, but the mo- 
ment that he arrived at this spot of safety 
he fainted away with fatigue, and remained 
a lono* time without sense or motion. 

When he recovered, he opened Ins 
eyes and looked round. Heavens, what 
a prospect ! the ship, the boat, his com- 
panions, all lost! There was nothing to 
be seen but a few broken planks, which 
the waves drove towards the shore. He 
alone was saved out of the whole ship's 
company. 

Trembling at once with fear and joy, he 
fell upon his knees, lifted up his hands to- 
wards Heaven, and while he shed a flood of 
tears, returned thanks aloud to the Ma- 
ker of heaven and earth for his miraculous 
preservation. 

Rich. But, papa, why did God Almighty 
D 4 save 



30 THE NEW 

save Robinson Crusoe alone, and suffer the 
rest to perish ? 

Mr. Bill. My dear Richard, are you al- 
ways able to discover the reasons why we 
who are so much older than you, and who 
love you tenderly, act towards you in this 
manner or that ? 

Rich. No. 

Air. Bill. Lately, for instance, when the 
day was so fine, and we had all so great a 
fancy to go on a nutting party, what did 
I do ? 

Rich. I have not forgot it. Poor Ed- 
ward was obliged to stay at home and keep 
house, and the rest of us were forced to go 
to Richmond, and not on the nutting party. 

Mr. Bill. But why was I so cruel to 
poor Edward, not to let him go with us ? 

Edw. Ah, I know the reason of that. 
James came presently after, and took me to 
Lady Castleton's. Frederick, my old play- 
fellow, was just come home from school, 
and be<r<red his mamma to send for me. 

Mr. 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 81 

Mr. Bill. And was not that better than 
to go a nutting ? 

Edw. Oh yes, a hundred times. 

Mr. Bill. I had sent word before to Lady 
Castleton, that you should go and see her 
son, as she requested ; and therefore it was 
that I ordered you to stay at home. And, 
Richard, what did you meet at Richmond? 

Rich. I met you there, papa, and my 
mamma. You were there before me. 

Mr. Bill. That too I knew; and, there- 
fore, I made you for that time go to Rich- 
mond, and not on the nutting party. My 
intentionin allthisnever once entered your 
heads, for you did not know my reasons. 
But why did not I tell you these reasons? 

Rich. That you might afford us an un- 
expected pleasure. 

Mr. Bill. Just so. Well, my dear chil- 
dren, do you not think that our heavenly 
Father loves his children, that is to say, 
all mankind, as much as we love you? 

Geo. Certainly, and more. 
Mr. Bill. And have you not learnt long 
D 5 ago, 



82 THE NEW 

ago, that God knows all things better than 
we poor mortals do, whose knowledge is 
so contracted, and who can so seldom tell 
what is really for our own advantage. 

Rich. Yes ; I believe it. God has a 
knowledge that is without bounds, and, 
therefore, knows every thing that will 
come to pass; a knowledge that we have 
no idea of. 

Mr. Bill. Since, therefore, God loves all 
mankind as his children, and is at the same 
time so wise that he alone knows what is 
really useful for us, it is impossible but he 
should do what is best for our interest. 

Geo. Without doubt, and so he does 
continually. 

Mr. Bill. But are we always able to dis- 
cover the reasons why God doth any 
action that affects us in one particular 
manner rather than in another? 

Rich. To discover them, we should 
have as much knowledge and wisdom as 
God himself. 

Mr. Bill. Well, my dear Richard, do 

vou 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 83 

you wish now to repeat the question that 
you asked me just now ? 

Rich. What question ? 

Mr. Bill. Why the Supreme Disposer 
of things saved only Robinson Crusoe, and 
suffered the rest to perish? 

Rich. No. 

Mr. Bill. Why not ? 

Rich. Because I see now that it was an 
unreasonable question. 

Mr. Bill. Unreasonable? Ilowr 

Rich. Because our Maker knows very 
well why he does any action, and we are 
not capable of knowing it. 

Mr. Bill. The Ruler of the Universe had 
therefore reasons which were wise, excel- 
lent, and worthy of himself, for suffering 
the whole crew to perish, and saving only 
the life of Robinson Crusoe. But these 
reasons are inscrutable to us. We may, in- 
deed, carry our conjectures to a certain 
length, but we ought never to flatter our- 
selves that we have hit upon the truth. 

For instance, infinite wisdom might fore- 
D 6 see 



84- THE NEW. 

see that a longer life would be more hurt- 
ful than advantageous to those whom he 
suffered to perish : they might fall into 
great distresses, or even become wicked ; 
for that reason, perhaps, he removed them 
from this world, and conducted their im- 
mortal souls to a place where they are hap- 
pier than here. As for Robinson Crusoe, 
probably his life was preserved to the end 
/that affliction might be a school of wisdom 
to him; for God, being a kind father, all 
wise and all just, sends adversity to turn 
the hearts of men, when they are blindly 
insensible to his goodness and support. 

Keep this in remembrance, my dear 
child, through the course of your life. 
You may meet with accidents and reverses 
in which you cannot perceive the design of 
Providence. Then, instead of rashly en- 
deavouring to reason or explain the seeming 
inconsistency, say to yourself," God knows 
better than I what is for my good ; I will, 
therefore, suffer with chearfulness this mis- 
fortune which he sends me as a trial. I am 

con- 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 85 

convinced that his dispensations of good and 
evil are ever intended to render us better 
than we are; I, for my part, will therefore 
labour to become so, and certainly God 
will bless and reward my endeavours." 

Henry. Did Robinson think so upon 
that occasion ? 

Mr. Bill. Yes, then when he had been 
in so great danger of perishing, and saw 
himself cut off from all the world, then he 
felt sincerely how unjust and blamable his 
conduct had been ; then he prayed to Hea- 
ven, on his knees, for pardon ; and then 
he took the stedfast resolution of amend- 
ing his life, and of never doing any action 
contrary to the warning of his conscience. 
Edw. But what did he do after that? 
Mr. Bill. When the joy that he felt on 
his happy deliverance had a little subsided, 
he began to reflect on his situation. He 
looked about him, but could see nothing 
except trees and thickets ; he could not 
perceive, on any side, the least mark that 

the country was inhabited. 

This 



BM THE NEW 

This was a dreadful necessity imposed 
upon him ; to live all alone in a strange 
country! But his anxiety was still more 
dreadfully increased when this reflection 
occurred to him, What, if there should be 
wild beasts or savages here, so that 1 should 
not be able to live a moment in safety! 
Charlotte. What are savages, papa? 
Rich. Savages are wild men. Have you 
never heard talk of them, Charlotte? In 
countries, a great, great way off from this, 
there are men nearly as wild as beasts. 

Geo. That go almost naked — What do 
you think of that ? 

Henry. Aye, and know scarce any thing 
in the world. They cannot build them- 
selves houses, nor make gardens, nor sow 
and plant, as we do. 

Harriet. And they eat raw meat and 
raw fish. I heard my papa tell of them — 
Did not you, papa?. 

Rich. And would you think it? These 
poor creatures are entirely ignorant of their 

Maker, 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 87' 

Maker, because they never had any person 
to instruct them. 

Henry. It is for that reason too that 
they are so barbarous. You would hardly 
believe that some of them eat human flesh. 

Charlotte. Oh ! what wicked men ! 

Mr. Bill. What poor unhappy men ! 
you should say. Alas ! these poor people 
are sufficiently to be pitied, that they have 
been brought up in this ignorance, and 
live like brutes. 

Charlotte. Do they ever come here? 

Mr. Bill. No: the countries where these 
unfortunate people live are so far off, that 
they never come here. Their number also 
grows less every day, because other civi- 
lized men, who come amongst them, en- 
deavour to instruct and civilize then . 

Henry. Were there, then, any of those 
savages in the country where Robinson 
Crusoe was thrown by the storm ? 

Mr. Bill. That he could not tell him- 
self as yet. But having formerly heard that 
there were savages in the islands in this 

part 



88 THE NEW 

part of the world, he thought it very pos- 
sible that there might be some on the par- 
ticular spot where he now was; and this 
thought raised such an apprehension of 
danger in his mind, that every bone of 
his body shook for fear. 

Geo. I do not doubt it. It would be no 
very pleasant matter to meet with savages. 

Mr Bill. Fear, at first, rendered him 
motionless ; he did not dare to stir; the least 
noise terrified him; his heart was frozen: 
but a burning thirst forced him at length 
from this fearful state ofinaction, and sent 
him up and down in search of some brook 
or spring to quench his thirst. Luckily he 
found a brook of pure and clear water 
where he might refresh himself to his ut- 
most wish. Oh! what a delicious treasure 
for a man who was parched up with thirst ! 

Robinson returned thanks to God for 
it, hoping, at the same time, that he would 
also vouchsafe him food. *' He who feeds 
the fowls of the air," said he, " will not 
suffer me to perish with hunger. " 

Indeed, 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 89 

Indeed, hunger was not very pressing on 
him at this time; fear and anxiety had taken 
away his appetite. He longed for rest more 
than any thing else. His pain and vexation 
of mind had so overpowered him that he 
could scarce stand upon his legs. 

However, the question was, Where must 
he pass the night ? On the ground, under 
the open air? There he would be exposed 
to savages or wild beasts that would devour 
him. House, or cabin, or cave, he saw no 
signs of. He knew not what to do ; his 
distress brought tears into his eyes; he 
cried heartily. At length he resolved to 
imitate the birds, and like them to seek a 
retreat in some tree. Presently he disco- 
vered one, the boughs of which were so 
thick and so closely interwoven, that he 
could sit amongst them, and even lay him- 
self at his length very conveniently. He 
climbed up this tree, offered up an earnest 
prayer to his Maker, then settled himself, 
and fell asleep in a moment. 

While he slept, his heated imagination 

represented 



90 THE HEW 

represented to him afresh the transactions 
of the preceding day. Disturbed with tu- 
mnltuous dreams, he fancied he still saw 
the waves swelling round him, and the ship 
sinking. The cries of the seamen still 
. sounded in his ears. After this, he ima- 
gined himself transported into the presence 
of his parents: they appeared overwhelmed 
with sorrow and distress for the loss of their 
beloved son : they sighed, wept, lifted up 
their hands to Heaven, and were utterly 
destitute of comfort. A cold sweat broke 
out all over his body: he cried aloud, " I 
am not lost, my dear parents ; I am restored 
to you once more :" and with these words, 
making a motion in his sleep as if to em- 
brace his parents, he lost his seat amongst 
the branches, and fell down out of the tree. 

Harriet. Oh poor Robinson ! 

Geo. I suppose he is killed now. 

Mr. Bill. Fortunately for him, he had 
not fixed himself far up in the tree; and 
the grass was so high upon the ground that 
his fall was not very severe. In effect, the 

slight 



ROBINSON CRUSOE* £1 

slight pain which it occasioned him he 
hardly felt, in comparison to the anguish 
that he had suffered in the conflicts of his 
dream, and which still agitated his whole 
body. He, therefore, climbed up once 
more into the tree, and lay there quietly 
until sun-rise* 

He then began earnestly to consider how 
he should procure himself food. He had 
no sort of victuals such as we use in this 
part of the world, neither bread, nor meat, 
nor vegetables, nor milk ; and, had he even 
been master of a joint of meat, he had nei- 
ther fire, nor spit to roast it on, nor pot to 
boil it in. All the trees that he had seen 
hitherto were logwood-trees, which never 
bear any fruit. 

Rich. What sort of trees are they,, 
papa? 

Mr. Bill. These are trees the wood of 
which is of considerable use in dying. They 
grow in some countries of South America, 
and much of the logwood is brought to 
Europe. When it is boiled, the water 

turns 



£>2 THE NEW 

turns of a reddish black colour, and dyers- 
make use of it to give a shade to other co- 
lours. 

But to return to Robinson Crusoe. 

Still uncertain what he should do, he 
came down from the tree. As he had eaten 
nothing the day before, hunger began to 
be exceedingly troublesome to him. He 
rambled about for several miles, but found 
nothing, except grass, and trees that bore 
no fruit. 

It was impossible now to add to his dis- 
tress; "Must I, then, perish with hunger 
at last?'' cried he, sobbing and looking up 
towards Heaven. However, necessity re- 
animated him with fresh strength to go 
and search carefully along the shore for 
something eatable. 

But in vain : nothing but logwood -trees 
and Indian willow; nothing but grass and 
sand. At length, fatigued, weakened, and 
exhausted, he threw himself down with his 
face to the ground, burst into tears, and 
wished that he had perished in the waves of 

the 



ROBINSON CRUSOE, Q$ 

the sea rather than be preserved only to 
die a miserable death by hunger. 

He thought of nothing, therefore, now 
but of waiting in this forlorn situation for 
the slow and dreadful approach of death ; 
when, turning by chance, he saw a cormo- 
rant devouring a fish that he had taken. 
Immediately he reecollected that he had 
somewhere read the following words: 

The Lord, who feeds with bounteous hand 

The feather'd tenants of the air, 
Will surely over maw expand 

The wings of his paternal care. 

He then reproached himself witli having 
put so. little trust in Divine Providence ; 
and, rising hastily, he determined to walk as 
far as ever his strength would permit him. 
He shaped his course, therefore, along the 
shore, and looked narrowly about to disco- 
ver, if possible, something that might serve 
him for food. 

At length he perceived a number of oyster 
shells lying on the shore. He ran eagerly 

. towards 



9% THE NEW 

towards the spot where they were, and 
carefully examined all round it, hoping 
to find oysters thereabouts. He did find 
some, and his joy was inexpressible. 

Rich, Are there oysters on land then ? 

Mr. Bill. Why no, not properly. On 
the contrary, they belong to the sea and 
live in it. There they fasten themselves to 
rocks, one upon another, in immense quan- 
tities. Such aheap of them is called a bed 
of oysters. Now the waves, in dashing 
against this, loosen several of the oysters, 
and the tide carries them towards the shore. 
Afterwards, when the tide ebbs, and it is 
low water, these oysters are left on the 
beacb, where it is then dry. 

Charlotte. You say when the tide ebbs, 
papa, what is that ? 

Harriet. What, don't you know that? It 
is when the water that was so high before, 
runs back and grows quite shallow. 

Charlotte. What water. 

Harriet. Why the sea water, or a river 
like our Thames where the tide comes up- 

Mr. 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. (J5 

Mr. Mered. Charlotte, make your bro- 
ther Richard explain that to you. He will 
be able to give you a clear idea of it. 

Rich. Who, I? Well, I will do my 
best. Have you never observed that the 
water of the Thames rises sometimes pretty 
high at the bottom of our garden ; and then, 
after a while, falls back and leaves the 
ground dry; so that one can walk where 
it was but a little time before covered 
with water ? 

Charlotte. Oh ! yes, now I remember 
to have seen it. 

Rich. Well, when the water rises in that 
manner, it is called the tide, or the flowing 
of the tide : and when it falls back and 
leaves the ground dry, it is called the ebb. 
Thus we say the tide ebbs and flows. 

Mr. Bill. Besides this, you must know, 
my dear Charlotte, that, in the course of 
four and twenty hours, the water of the sea 
rises thus twice, and falls twice. It conti- 
nues to rise for a little more than six hours, 
and then to sink for a little more than six 

hours. 



96 TJHE NEW 

hours. The hours during which it rises, 
are called the time of the flow, and the 
hours during which it falls, are called the 
time of the ebb. Do you understand it now? 
Charlotte. Yes ; but why does the sea 
always rise so ? 

Geo. I think I have heard the reason. 

It is said, the moon attracts the waters in 

such a manner, that they are obliged to rise, 

Edw. Oh ! we have often heard that. 

Let papa go on. 

Mr. Bill. Another time, Charlotte, I 
will tell you more upon this subject. 

Robinson was almost out of his wits for 
joy at having found something to appease 
his raging hunger. The oysters that he 
found did not, it is true, serve to fill his 
belly; but he was satisfied with having 
found spmething which barely made him 
forget'his hunger as it were. 

His greatest uneasiness was next to know 
where he should dwell for the future, to be 
free from all dread of savages an dwildbeasts. 
His first bed had been so inconvenient, that 

he 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. &7 

he .could not think of his condition without 
shuddering, if he should he obliged to pass 
all his nights in the same manner. 

Geo. Oh ! I know very well what I would 
have done. 

Mr. Bill. Well, what would you have 
done ? Inform us. 

Geo. In the first place, I would have 
built a house with walls as thick as that 
and with iron gates — so strong ! — And then 
I would have made a ditch all round with 
a drawbridge, and this drawbridge I would 
have lifted up every night, and then the sa- 
vages must be pretty cunning if they could 
have done me any harm while I was asleep. 

Mr. Bill. Here is fine talking ! It is a 
pity that you had not been there. You 
would have been able to give poor Ro- 
binson excellent advice. — But — answer me 
one thing — Have you ever carefully ob- 
served how carpenters and masons go about 
building a house 

Geo. Oh ! yes, many a time. The ma*- 
son begins with preparing the lime and 

Vol. I. E mixing 



38 THE NEW 

mixing sand with it. Then he lays one 
stone upon another, and with his trowel 
puts mortar between them to keep them 
firmly together. Next the carpenters, with 
their hatchets, cut out the rafters and place 
them carefully. Then, by means of a 
pully, they raise the beams to the height 
of the wall and join them. Afterwards 
they saw the boards for the floors, and 
make laths, which they nail to the rafters 
in order to place the tiles. And then — 

Mr. Bill. I see you have taken particu- 
lar notice how they go about building a 
house. But then a mason makes use of 
lime, and a trowel, and bricks ; or else 
stones, which must first be cut into form ; 
and carpenters have occasion for hatchets 
and saws, and chisels, and nails, and ham- 
mers. Where would you have found all 
these, if you had been in Robinson's place ! 

Geo. Why — really I dont know. 

Mr. Bill. Neither did Robinson, and for 
that reason he was obliged to give up the 
scheme of building a real house. He had 

not 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 99 

not a single tool in the world : nothing but 
his two hands, and with these alone people 
do not build such houses as we live in. 

Edw. Why, then, he had only to make 
himself a little hut with the branches that 
he could have plucked from the trees. 

Mr. Bill. And could a little hut, made 
of branches, have defended him from ser- 
pents, wolves, tigers, panthers, lions, and 
other fierce beasts of prey ? 

Rich. Ah ! poor Robinson, how will you 
manage in this distressful situation? 

Edw. Could he shoot ? 

Mr. Bill. Yes, if he had only a gun, with 
powder and ball; but once more I tell you, 
the poor lad had nothing — absolutely no- 
thing but his two hands to depend on. 

When he viewed his situation, and saw 
that all resources failed him, he fell again 
into his former despondency. "To what 
purpose," said he within himself, " have I 
hitherto escaped perishing with hunger, 
since, perhaps, this very night wild beasts 
will tear me to pieces ?" 

E2 H<g 



100 THE NEW 

He even fancied (such is the force of the 
imagination) that a furious tiger Mas he- 
fore him, with its dreadful jaws open and 
ready to devour him. Thinking that the 
tiger had him already by the throat, he 
cried out, "Oh my poorfatherand mother!" 
and fell to the ground half dead. 

After having lain there some time in an 
agony of grief and despair, he recollected 
a hymn which he had heard his excellent 
mother sometimes sing, when she had any 
pressure of affliction on her mind. It be- 
gan thus : 

He who beneath Heaven's guardian wing 

Hath wisely fixed his place, 
May to his soul thus freely sing, 

When sorrows come apace : 

In God's eternal Providence 

My hope redemption sees : 
Blest with so powerful a defence, 

My soul, be thou at ease. 

The reflections contained in these words 
strengthened him considerably. Two or 
three times he repeated these beautiful line's 

to 



ROBINSOX CRUSOE, 101 

to himself with much devotion: after which 
he exerted his strength to rise, and went up- 
on another search,endeavouring to find some 
cave that might serve him as a safe retreat. 
Bat in what part of the world was he ? 
In South America, or elsewhere? Was he 
upon an island or a continent ? This was 
more than he could tell as yet himself; but 
he saw a pretty high bill at a distance, and 
he walked towards it. 

As he went along, he made this sorrow- 
ful discovery, that the whole country pro- 
duced nothingbutgrassand treeswhich bore 
no fruit. It is easy to imagine >hat gloomy 
ideas a sight like this inspired him with. 

He climbed up, with some difficulty, to 
the top of the hill, which was pretty high, 
and from which hecould see all round him 
to the distance of several leagues. To his 
great mortification, he perceived that he 
was really in an island, within sight of which 
there appeared no other land, except two 
or three small islands that rose out of the 
sea at the distance of a few leagues. 

E 3 " Poor, 



J 02 THE NEW 

" Poor, unhappy wretch that I am V\ 
cried lie, lifting slowly his trembling hands 
towards Heaven; "I am, then, separated, 
cut o tf from all men, and have no hopes of 
being ever delivered from this savage place. 
Oh! my poor afflicted parents, I shall, then, 
never see you more! I shall never be able 
to ask you forgiveness for my folly \ Never 
shall I hear the sweet voice of a friend, of a 
man !— But I deserve my fate," continued 
he. " Oh Lord, thou art just in all thy 
ways! I should but deceive myself were I 
to complain. It is I myself that have made 
my lot so miserable." 

In this mournful silence he continued on 
the spot, with his eyes fixed, as it were, to 
the ground. " Cut off from God and man V f 
was the only reflection that possessed hfs 
mind. At length, however, thoughts more 
rational and consoling came to his relief. 
lie threw himself upon his knees, lifted 
up his heart to Heaven, promised to be pa* 
tient and resigned to his distresses, and 
prayed for strength to support them. 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 103 

Harriet. It was a good thing, however, 
that Robinson could say his prayers in the 
time of distress. 

Mr. Bill. Certainly it was happy for him. 
What would have become of him, then, if 
he had not known that God is the Father 
of all mankind; that he is supremely good, 
almighty, and omnipresent? He would 
have sunk under his terror and despair if 
he had not formerly been taught these 
great and comfortable truths. But the 
idea of his heavenly Father's goodnes gave 
him constantly fresh courage and consola- 
tion, whenever his distresses were upon 
the point of overpowering his resolution. 

He now found himself much strengthen- 
ed, and began to travel round the hill. All 
his search was, for a long time, useless: he 
could find no place where he might be in 
safety. At length, he came to a little hill, 
which, in front, was as steep as a wall. In 
examining this spot attentively, he found a 
place that seemed to be hollowed in under 
the hill, with a pretty narrow entrance to it. 
E4 If 



104- . THE NEW 

If he had had a pickaxe, a crow, and 
other tools, it would have heen an easy 
matter to hollow out a complete dwelling 
under the rock, which was partly done by 
nature; but he had none of these tools. 
The question was, then, how he should 
supply the want of them. 

After puzzling his head a long time, he 
began to reflect in this manner: "Some 
of the trees that I see here are like the 
willows of my country, which are easily 
transplanted. I will pluck up a number of 
these young trees, and here, before this hole, 
I will plant them close together, so that 
they may form a sort of wali. When they 
grow up pretty high, I shall be able to sleep 
within this enclosure as safely as if I was 
in a house; for behind, the steep wall of 
this rock will secure me, and in front, as 
well as on both sides, the close row of 
trees will keep off all danger." 

This happy thought pleased him very 
much, and he immediately set about putting 
it in execution. His joy was still greater 

when 



HOJUXSON CRUSOE. 105 

when he saw, not far from that spot, a 
beautiful and clear spring bubbling out 
from the side of the hill. lie hastened to 
quench his thirst at it, being extremely 
dry, as he had run about a good deal 
during the hottest time of the day. 

Geo. Was it so very warm* then, in 
the island? 

Mr. Bill. Yes, you may easily imagine 
that it was warm. Look here (pointing to 
the map,) this is the coast of South Ame- 
rica, near which, propably, was situated the 
island on which Robinson was cast away. 
Now, you see, this part is not far from the 
equinoctical line, where the sun is some- 
times directly over people's heads. It is, 
therefore, natural to suppose that all that 
quarter must be extremely hot. 

Robinson now set about plucking up out 
of the ground, with his hands, some of the 
young trees that I mentioned before, which, 
he effected with a great deal of trouble, and 
carried them to the place that he had des-t 
tined for his dwelling. Here again he wa$, 
E5 obliged 



106 THE l\E\\ 

obliged to scratch a hole in the ground foi 
each of his trees, and as this work went 
on hut very slowly, the day closed by the 
time that he had fixed five or six of them. 

After he had finished his work, hunger 
obliged himto walk down towards the shore 
in order to search for oysters ; but, unfor- 
tunately, the tide was up, so that he found 
none, and was forced for this time to go 
to bed supperless. But where was his 
bed? — Me determined, until he could finish 
for himself a complete and secure habita- 
tion, to lie every night in the tree in which 
he had lain the last night. 

But, that he might not be exposed to the 
same accident as had then disturbed him, he 
took his garters, tied them round his body, 
and fastened himself tightly to the branches 
on which he lay; and then, recommend- 
ing himself to his Creator, he fell asleep. 

Rich. That was wisely done of him to 
tie himself so. 

Mr. Bill. Why, necessity is the mother 
of invention. She teaches us many things 

which 



BOB IX SON CRUSOE. 107 

which we should not know but for her. 
It is to this intent that our Creator hath 
formed us, and tills earth that we inhabit, 
in such a manner that we have different 
wants, which we cannot satisfy unless by 
the manifold efforts of invention. If ever 
we are masters of good sense and an active 
understanding, it is to these wants that we 
are indebted for them r for if larks fell 
clown out of the air into- our mouths ready 
roasted ; if houses, beds, cloaths, victuals, 
and every thing else necessary for the 
preservation and comfort of our lives, grew 
up of their own accord out of the ground 
or on the tops of trees, quite ready and 
prepared to our hand, certainly we should 
do nothing else but eat, drink, and sleep, 
and be as stupid as brutes as long as we 
lived,

rOURTH EVENING, 

JITr. Bill. Well, my dears, where did we 
leave Robinson Crusoe last night? 

Rich. We left him like a bird perched 
in a tree to take his night's rest. 

Mr. Bill. Very well, to proceed, then, 
with his story : Every thing went on that 
night as well as possible ; he had no fall, 
and slept soundly till morning. 

At break of day, the first thing that he 
did was to set off towards the shore to look 
for oysters, intending afterwards to return 
to his work. He happened this time to go 
another way, and, as he walked along, was 
overjoyed to find a tree that bore large 
fruit. It is true, he did not as yet know 
what they might be ; but he hoped to find 
them good for eating, and therefore, to 
make a trial, he knocked down one. 

It was a large nut, something of a tri- 
angular form, and as big as a young child's 
head. The outward rind was composed of 

filaments, 



EOBINSOtf CfttiSOE. 109 

filaments, or stringy folds, as if made of 
hemp. The second husk or shell was, on 
the contrary, almost as hard as the shell of 
a tortoise, and Robinson soon perceived 
that it would serve him for a cup. This 
shell is so large that it sometimes affords a 
place of retirement to the little long-tailed 
American monkey. The fruit within was 
a sort of juicy kernal, which tasted like a 
sweet almond, and in the middle of this 
kernal, which was hollow, he found a most 
delicious and finely flavoured milk. This 
was a most agreeable treat for poor Robin- 
son, who was half starved. 

His empty stomach was not satisfied 
with one nut, he knocked down a second, 
which he ate with equal greediness. His 
joy at having discovered this excellent fruit 
brought tears into his eyes, and he looked 
up to Heaven with sensations of the warm- 
est gratitude. 

The tree was tolerably large, and quite 
hung with fruit ; but alas ! it was the 
only one in the whole island. 

Geo. 



1 10 THE NLW 

Geo. What sort of a tree might it be 
then? We have none such here. 

Mr Bill. It was a cocoa nut tree. They 
grow chiefly there, in the East Indies; and 
here, in the South Sea islands* There are 
some of them found in the West Indies ; 
indeed, they are pretty common there. 

Though Robinson's hunger was now sa- 
tisfied, yet he did not omit going down to 
theshore, to see what shew the oysters made 
that day. He found a few, indeed, but far 
too few to afford him a hearty meal. He 
had, therefore, great reason to thank God 
for having this day furnished him with an- 
other sort of food ; and he did so with a 
heart full of gratitude. 

He carried home for his dinner the oys- 
ters that he had found, and went cheerfully 
about his yesterday's work again. 

He had picked up on the beach a large 
shell, which served him instead of a spade, 
and advanced his work considerably. A 
little after he discovered a plant, the stalk of 

which 



ROBIXSOX CRUSOE. Ill 

which was full of threads, like flax or hemp. 
At another time he would not have paid 
any attention to such matters, but, at pre- 
sent, nothing was indifferent to him. He 
examined every thing, and reflected on 
every thing, in order, if possible, to apply 
every thing to advantage. 

Having some hopes that this plant might 
be used in the same manner as flax or hemp, 
he plucked a quantity of it, tied it up in 
small bundles, and left them to soak in wa- 
ter. Having observed, at the end of a few 
days, that the thick outside skin was suffi- 
ciently softened by the water, he drew out 
the bundles, and spread them thinly on the 
grass before the sun, the stalks being now 
quite soft. As soon as ever they were pro- 
perly dried, he made a trial with a lanre 
stick to pound them and break them like 
flax, and he succeeded. 

Immediately he endeavoured to turn the 
stringy part of these plants to use by mak- 
ing small cords of it. It is true thev were 
not so well twisted as those made by our 

roue- 



1 13 >TIIE NEW 

rope-makers here, for he had n either wheel 
nor a second person to assist him. However, 
they were strong enough to fasten his great 
shell to the end of a stick, by which means 
he was now master of an instrument not 
much unlike a gardener's spade. 

He then went on with his work very di- 
ligently, and planted tree close by tree until 
he had completely palisaded the space that 
was before his intended dwelling. But, as 
one single row of a tree so very pliable did 
not seem a sufficient wall of defence, he 
spared no labour, but planted a second row 
round the first. He then interwove the 
branches of the two rows together, and, at 
last, hit upon the idea of filling up with 
earth the distance that was between them 
This completed his wall so solid that it 
would have required a considerable force 
to push it in. 

Every morning aud evening he watered 
his little plantation with water from the 
neighbouring spring, which he took up in 
his cocoa shell; and he had very soon the 

satisfaction 



ROBINSON" CRUSOE. 113 

satisfaction of seeing his young trees sprout 
up and flourish so as to afford, a charming 
view to the eye. 

When he had almost entirely finished his 
hedge, lie spent a whole day in making a 
number of thick cords, out of which he 
formed, as well as he could, a ladder of 
ropes. 

Henry. What was that for? 

Mr. Bill. I'll tell you. His design was 
to make no door to his habitation, but to 
plant more trees, and so stop up even the 
opening that remained. 

Henry. How, then, was he to go in and 
out? 

Mr. Bill. By the assistance of his lad- 
der of ropes. 

It is to he observed, that the rock which 
hung over his habitation was about as high 
as the second story of a house, and on the 
top of the rock was a tree. To this he fast- 
ened his ladder of ropes, and let it hang 
down to the ground. He then tried to 
climb up by it, and succeeded to admiration- 
All 



114 THE NEW 

All this being finished, he considered 
by what means he might make the little 
hollow under the rock large enough to 
serve him for a habitation. He saw very 
well, that with his hands alone he should 
never be able to manage it. What was to 
be done, then? He must find out some 
tool or instrument for the purpose. 

With this design he repaired to a spot 
where he had seen a great number of hard 
green stones scattered on the ground. Hav- 
ing searched among them carefully, he at 
last found one, the very sight of which 
made him jump for joy; for, in effect, this 
stone had the very form of a hatchet, and 
even a hole to fit the handle in. Robinson 
saw, at first view, that it would make an 
excellent hatchet, if he could but enlarge 
the hole ever so little. After a world of 
pains, he at length happily accomplished 
this by means o^ another stone ; then he 
fixed a pretty thick stick in it, by way of 
hanJic, and with some of the cord which 
he had made himself] he fastened it as firm 
as if it had been nailed in. 



ROBIXSOX CRUSOE. 115 

He now tried to fell a small tree, and the 
attempt proving no less successful, filled 
him with inexpressible joy. Had anyone 
offered him one hundred pounds for his 
hatchet, he would not have parted } with 
it, such vast advantages did he promise 
himself from the use of it. 

Searching still amongst those green 
stones, he found two more equally fit. for 
use. The one had nearly the form of a 
mallet, such as is used by carpenters and 
stonecutters; the other was shaped like a 
stout short bludgeon, having an edge or 
corner at the end. Robinson carried them 
both to his habitation, intending to go to 
work with them immediately. 

He succeeded to his wish. Laying the 
edge of the one stone upon the earth and 
rock, and striking it with the other resem- 
bling a mallet, he knocked off several 
pieces of the rock, and, in a few days, was 
so far advanced in clearing out the hollow, 
that it seemed large enough for him to lie 
in at his ease. 

He

He had before this plucked up with his 
hands a quantity of grass, which he had 
spread before the sun to make hay of it. 
This being now sufficiently dried, he car- 
ried it to his cave to make himself a good 
bed. 

From this time he was able to sleep like 
a human creature, without being obliged, 
as he had for many rights before, to perch 
like a bird up in a tree. What a luxury it 
was to him to stretch his weary limbs upon 
a soft bed of hay ! He thanked God, and 
"said within himself, " Oh! if my country- 
men khew what it is to pass, as I have done> 
several nights successively, seated upon a 
hard branch of a tree, how happy would 
they count themselves to be able to enjoy 
the refreshment of sleep in convenient beds, 
secure from accidents by falling or other- 
wise ! Certainly they would not let slip a 
day without sincerely thanking Providence 
for all the conveniences and delights which 
theyenjoy."

binson dedicated it to rest, to prayer, and 
meditation. He spent whole hours on his 
knees, with his eyes turned towards hea- 
ven, praying to God to pardon his sins, and 
to bless and comfort his poor parents. 
Then, with tears of joy, he thanked his 
Maker for the providential assistance that 
he had experienced in a situation in which 
he was cut off from the whole world ; he 
promised to grow better every day, and 
to persevere in his filial obedience. 

Harriet. Well, I think master Robinson 
is grown much better than he was. 

Air. Bill. Providence foresaw that he 
would grow better uuder affliction, and, 
therefore, suffered him to undergo the trial 
of it; for thus our heavenly Father acts 
towards us all. It is not in his anger, but 
in his tender mercv, that he sends us mis- 
fortunes: he knows that they are necessary 
to us, in order to render us humbler and 
better. Far from being hurtful to us, they 
become salutary remedies in his beneficent 
hands. 

That

That he might not forget the order of 
days, but know regularly on what day Sun- 
day would fall, Robinson thought of mak- 
ing himself an almanack. 

Rick. An almanack ? 

Mi\ BilL Yes; not a printed one, it is 
true, nor quite so exact as those that we 
have in Europe, but still an almanack by 
which he was able to count the days regu- 
larly. 

Rich* And how did he manage that ? 

Mr, Bill. Having neither paper nor any 
thing else requisite for writing, he chose 
four trees that were close beside each other, 
and pretty smooth on the bark. On the 
largest of the four he marked every even- 
ing a notch, to signify that a day was past. 
When he had made seven notches, the 
week was expired. Then he cut in the next 
tree another notch to express a week. As 
often as he had completed in the second 
tree four notches, he marked on the third, 
With a notch of the same sort, the revolu- 
tion of a whole month ! and, lastly, when 

these 



BOBINSOX CRUSOE. 119 

these marks that stood for months amount- 
ed to twelve in number, he made a score 
on the fourth tree to denote thrt the whole 
year >vas expired. 

Henry. But all the months are not 
equally long: some have thirty-one days, 
others but thirty: how then could he mark 
exactly the number of days in each? 

Mr. Bill. That he could reckon on his 
fingers. 

Rich. On his fingers ? 

Mr. Bill. Yes; and, if you chuse, I will 
shew you how too. 

All the children. Oh ! dear papa, do.l 

Mr. Bill.. Well, then, observe. He 
shut his left hand so ; then, with the fore 
finger of his right hand, he touched one 
of the knuckles or finger joints of the left, 
and then the hollow that is beside it, and 
so on, naming the months in their order. 
Every month that falls upon a knuckle has 
thirty-one days, whereas the others which 
fall upon the hollows between the joints 
have only thirty; excepting the month of 

February 



]£0 THE SEW 

February alone, which has not so much 
as thirty, but twenty-eight, and once in 
every four years twenty-nine. 

He began, therefore, with the knuckle 
of the fore finger, and touching that, lie 
named the first month of the year, January. 
How many days then has January ? 

Rich. Thirty- one. 

Mr. Bill. I will go on, then, reckoning 
the months upon the knuckles of my fin- 
gers, and do you, Richard, as I name each, 
tell me the number of days that it contains. 
In the second place, therefore, February? 

Rich. Should have thirty days, but it 
has only twenty-eight, and sometimes twen- 
ty-nine. 

Mr. Bill. March? 

Rich. Thirty-one. 

Mr. Bill. April?'

Mr. Bill. Well, Henry, you have reck- 
oned along with us in your pocket alma- 
mack, have we made it out right ? 

Henry. Yes, papa, you have not missed 
a tittle. 

Mr. Bill. Such little matters as these are 
worth remembering, because you have not 
always an almanack at hand, and yet there 
is occasion for yon sometimes to know how 
many days there are in this or that month. 

Rich. Oh, Til warrant I shall not forget. 

Vol, I. F Henry. 



122 THE NEW 

Henry. Nor I, for I have taken parti- 
cular notice. 

Mr. Bill. It was thus, then, that our 
friend Robinson took care not to lose the 
order of time, but to know on what days 
the Sabbath fell, that he might keep it 
holy, after the manner of Christians. 

In the mean time, he had used the great- 
est part of the cocoa nuts that he had stored 
up, having discovered but one tree of the 
find as yet, and the shore furnished him 
with so few oysters, that they were not suffi- 
cient to keep him alive. He began, there- 
fore, to be uneasy again concerning the ar- 
ticle of food. 

Hitherto fearful and cautious, he- had not 
dared to go to any great distance from his 
dwelling. The dread of wild beasts, or of 
men not much more civilized, if any were 
to be found in the country, kept him at 
home; but necessity at length obliged him 
to conquer his reluctance, and to walk a 
little farther into the island, in order, if 
possible, to discover a new stock of provi- 
sions. 



"ROBINSON CRUSOE. 125 

sions. With this intent he resolved, the 
following <Jay, with God's blessing and pro- 
tection, to traverse the whole island. 

But, in order to defend himself from the 
excessive heat of the sun, he spent the 
whole evening making an umbrella. 

Edw. Where did he find silk and whale- 
bone ? 

Mr. Bill. He had neither silk nor whale- 
bone; nor had he either knife, scissars, 

needle, or thread; and yet but how do 

you think he set about making an um- 
brella ? 

Edw. That I cannot tell. 

Mr. Bill. He wove the top of it with 
sprigs of willow, like a large round basket, 
not very deep : in the middle of this he 
fixed a stick, which he tied with his pack- 
thread, and then he went to the cocoa-nut 
tree for some large leaves, which he fas- 
tened with pins to the outside. 

Rich. With pins ? Where had he those 
pins ? 

Mr, Bill. Guess. 

F % Harriet. 



l l 24 THE NEW 

Harriet. Oh, I can tell. He found them 
among the sweepings, or between the chinks 
of the floor. I find a good many there. 

Rich* A wise discovery ! As if one could 
find pins where there was nobody to lose 
them ! Besides, what sweepings could 
there be, or what floor in Robinson's little 
cave ? 

Mr. Bill. Well, who can guess ? How 
would you do if you wanted to fasten any 
thing, and had no pins ? 

"Rich. I would use thorns, such as grow 
on the hawthorn tree. 

Geo. xAnd I would use those strong 
pricklesthat we see on gooseberry bushes. 

Mr. Bill. Pretty well both; however, I 
must tell you, that Robinson used neither 
the one nor the other, by reason that he 
never saw either hawthorn or gooseberry 
tree in all his island. 

Rick. What then did he use ? 

Mr. Bill. Fish bones. The sea threw 
dead fishes up on the beach, from time to 
time, and when their bodies rotted away or 

were 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. \ c 25 

were devoured by birds of prey, their 
bones remained dry. Of these Robinson 
had gathered some of the strongest and 
sharpest to use as pins. 

By means of them he contrived to make 
up an umbrella so close that not a single 
ray of the sun could penetrate it. When- 
ever any new piece of work succeeded with 
him, his joy was inexpressible; then he used 
to say to himself, "Have not I been, a great 
fool to pass the best part of my youth in 
idleness? Oh! if I were in Europe now, 
and had all those tools at my command 
that are so easy to be procured there, what 
things I could make for myself! And what 
a pleasure it would be to me to make up 
myself the greatest part of my furniture, 
and the working, tools that I should have 
occasion for." 

As it was not very late, he bethought 

himself of trying to make a. bag that might 

hold his provision, if he should be so lucky 

as to find any in his excursion. He turned 

F 3 this 



126 THE NEW 

this scheme in his thoughts for a while, 
and at length succeeded in finding means 
to accomplish it. 

You must know, he had made a tolerable 
good stock of packthread; of this he re- 
solved to weave a piece of network, and 
of the network to make a bag. 

Now it was thus he set about it. He 
fastened across, between two trees that 
were little more than a yard asunder, se- 
veral threads, one udder the other, and as 
close as possible. This resembled exactly 
what weavers call the xvarp. In the next 
place, he joined regularly, from top to bot- 
tom, thread with thread, still as close as 
possible, knotting the thread that went 
down with each thread that went across, 
exactly in the same manner as when one 
weaves a net. These threads, therefore, that 
went downwards, formed what is called the 
woof: and by this sort of workmanship he 
in a short time completed a piece of net- 
ting not unlike such as fishermen use. He 

next 



SOBIXSON CRUSOE. l c ~/ 

next slipped off the ends of the threads 
from the trees to which they were fastened, 
and joined the sides of the netting toge- 
ther, closing up the bottom; thus he left 
no part open but the top. Here was a bag 
or pouch complete, which he hung by his 
side, having fastened both ends of a stout 
piece of packthread to the mouth, and 
slipping the loop over his neck. 

The happy success of Ins labour filled 
him with so much joy that he \yaa scarce 
able to close his eyes all night, 

Geo, I should like to have such a bag 
as that. 

. Edw. So should I too, if we had only 
some packthread. 

Mrs. Bill. If you wished to enjoy as 
much satisfaction from your work as Ro- 
binson did from his, you should b*gin with 
making the packthread yourseh cs, and you 
yourselves should prepare the aemp or the 
flax for that purpose; but as there is neither 
flax nor hemp ripe at this season of the 
year, I Mall furnish you with packthread.

J 28 THE NEW 

Geo. Oh dear mamma, will you be si* 



good ? 



Mrs. Bill. Yes, my dear, if you desire it. 

Geo. That is delightful.. 

Harriet. You are doing what is very 
right ; for if ever you should happen to be 
in an island where there was not a living 
soul but yourself, you know beforehand 
how to set about such things; eh, papa? 

Mr. Bui. Right. Well, make a trial. 
As to Robinson, we will let him sleep till 
to-morrow, In the mean time, we shall 
see if it is not possible to be as cunning 
as he, and to make an umbrella. 



FIFTH EVENING 



PilE next evening, the company being 
assembled in the usual place, Edward 
came strutting in with a pouch of network 

that 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 129 

that lie made himself, and which drew the 
eyes of the whole company upon him. In- 
stead of an umbrella, he had borrowed a 
sieve from the cook, and stuck a broom- 
stick through it. This he held over his 
head as. he came in, and marched up to the 
table, with a great deal of importance and 
solemnity. 

Mrs. Bill. Bravo. Edward! why this 
is excellent, I had almost taken you far 
Robinson Crusoe himself. 

Rick. Ah ! if I had but had a few mi- 
nutes more time to finish my bag, I could 
have come in the same manner. 

Geo. So could I too.. 

Mr. Bill. Well Edward has shewn that 
other people can make pouches of network 
as well as Robinson Crusoe. But, my man, 
your umbrella is not worth a farthing. • 

Edxv. Oh, papa, I only make shift with 
this for the present, because I was- not able 
to finish another in the. time. 

Mr. Btllingsley (opening a closet door, and

himself.) What say you to this, Mr. Ro- ; 
6inson Crusoe? 

Edzv. Ah ! that is a fine one. 

Mr. Bill. I keep it until we come to the 
end of the story. Then he who shall have 
best performed the several pieces of work 
mentioned in it, shall be our Robinson 
Crusoe, and I will make him a present of 
the umbrella. 

Geo. And must he really make a cave 
too, or a hut? 

Mr. Bill. Why not? 

All the Children. Oh, that is excellent, 
that is delightful. 

Mr. Bill. Robinson could scarce wait for 
the daylight. He rose before the sun, and 
prepared for his journey. ; He slipped his 
pouch string over his neck, put a strong 
cord round his waist by. way of girdle, in 
which- he stuck his hatchet instead of 
£\vord, took his umbrella upon his shoulder, 
and so courageously began his inarch. 
[See the Frontispiece. .] 

He first paid a visit to his cocoa-nut tree, 
to furnish his bag with a nut or two. Pro- 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 131 

vided with some of this excellent food, he 
went straight down to the sea-side to seek 
also some oysters; and, having got a small 
store of these two articles, in case of ne- 
cessity, he took a slight breakfast, with a 
drink of fresh water from his spring, and 
marched off. 

The morning was delightful; the sun was 
just then rising in all his glory, and seemed 
as if he ascended out of the sea. A thou- 
sand birds, of different sorts and the great- 
est variety of admirable plumage, were then 
singing their morning song, and rejoicing 
at the return of light. The air was as pure 
and as fresh as if it had been but just then 
created, and the plants and flowers exhaled 
the most exquisite perfume. 

Robinson felt his heart expand with joy 
and gratitude. " Even here," said he, 
6i even here doth the Creator of the Uni- 
verse shew himself the most beneficent of 
beings?"; — He then mixed his voice with 
the melody of the birds, and sang a morn- 
ing hymn, which he had formerly learnt, 
and still retained in memory. 



OS THE NEW 

As his fear of wild animals, whether men 
or beas\$. was not yet entirely dissipated, 
he avoided, in his walk, as much as possible, 
all forests and thickets, chusing, on the 
contrary, such grounds as allowed him an 
open prospect on every side ; but unfortu- 
nately these grounds were the barrenest 
parts of the whole island, so that he had 
gone a pretty long way without finding 
any thing that cauld repay him for. his 
trouble, or be the least serviceable to him. 

At last he observed a parcel of plants, 
which he resolved to inspect a little. closer : 
they were growing together in tufts, and 
formed a kind of little coppice. Some had 
reddish blossoms, others white; a third sort, 
instead of blossoms, were covered with little 
green apples, about the size of a cherry* 

He eagerly bit one of these apples, but 
found it .unfit for eating, which so vexed 
him, that he plucked up the whole tuft, and 
was going to fling it away with all his force, 
when he perceived, to his great surprise, a 
number of round knobs hanging from the 

roots. 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 135 

roots of the tuft. He. immediately, sus- 
pected that these were properly the fruit 
of the plant, and, therefore, began to 
examine them. 

But, however, this time his taste disap- 
pointed him ; the fruit was hard and disa- 
greeable to the palate. Robinson had a 
mind to throw the whole away ; but fortu- 
nately he recollected that a thing should 
not be reckoned absolutely useless, because 
we cannot all at once discover the utility 
of it. He, therefore, put a few of these 
kpobbed fruit into his pouch, and con- 
tinued his walk. 

Rich. I know what these knobbed fruit 
were. 

Mr. Bill. Come, what do you think 
they were? 

Rich. Why,^ they were potatoes ; they 
grow exactly as you. have described these 
knobs. 

Henry. And America is their original 
soil too. 

Geo, Aye, it was from that country that 

Sir 



134- . THE NEW 

Sir Francis Drake brought them. But 
Robinson was very stupid not to know 
potatoes. 

Mr. BilL Would you know them? 

Geo. Law ! I have seen potatoes, and 
eat of them a hundred times. I am very 
fond of them. 

Mr. BilL But Ptobinson had, perhaps, 
never seen any of them ; at least, as they 
grow in the ground. 

Geo. No ? 

Mr. BilL No : consider, that was forty 
or fifty years ago, when they were by no 
means so common in some parts of Eng- 
gland as they are at present. 

Geo. Oh ! then I beg his pardon. 

Mr. BilL You see, my dear George., 
how wrong it is to be too hasty in blaming 
others. We should always put ourselves 
in their place, and first ask the question if 
we could have done better than they. If 
you yourself had never seen potatoes, nor 
heard in what manner they should be drest, 
you would have been as much puzzled as 

Robinson 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 155 

Robinson to find out the use of them. Let 
this teach you never to think yourself 
cleverer than other people. 

Geo, It shall, papa. 

Mr. Bill. Robinson continued his walk/ 
but very slowly, and with a great deal of 
caution. The least noise, made by the wind 
in shaking the trees and the thickets, star- 
tled him, and made him put his hand to 
his hatchet to defend himself in case of 
need. Rut he ahvays saw, to his great joy, 
that his fright was without foundation. 

At length he arrived on the banks of a 
rivulet, where he resolved to make his 
dinner. He seated himself at the foot of 
a large branchy tree, and was just going 
to regale himself heartily, when, all at 
once, a noise, 5 " at a distance, threw him 
again into a terrible fright, 

He looked round, with terror in his 
countenance, and, at length, perceived a 
whole troop of— — 

Edzv. Oh la ! savages, I suppose; 

Geo. Or else lions and tigers. 

Mr. 



136 THE KEW 

Mr. Bill. Neither one nor the other; 
but a troop of wild animals, which have 
some resemblance to our sheep, except that 
on their back they bear a small bunch like 
that of a camel. As to their size, they 
were very little larger than a sheep. If 
you would wish to know what these ani- 
mals were, and how they were, called*. I 
will tell you. 

Rich. Oh 1 yes, papa, if you please. 

Mr. Bill. They are called lamas ; their 
country is properly that part of America 
which belongs to the Spaniards, and is call- 
ed Peru. There, before the discovery of 
that extensive country by Francis Pizarro 
and Almagro, the Peruvians had tamed 
this animal, and were accustomed to load 
it, and use it for a beast of burthen, as we 
do horses and mules. Of; its wool they 
made stuffs for cloathing. 

Rich. Then the people of Peru* were 
not so savage as the other Americans. 

Mr. Bill. Not by a great deal. They liv- 
ed in houses properly built; as did also the 

Mexicans 



6 




ROBINSON CRUSOE. 137 

Mexicans (here in North America); they 
had built magnificent temples, and were 
governed by kings. 

Geo. Is it not from this country that the 
Spaniards draw all that gold and silver for 
which they go every year to America, in 
their galleons, as you have told us ? 

Mr. Bill The same. — Robinson seeing 
these lamas approach, felt a violent desire to 
eatsomeroastmeat, which he hadnot tasted 
for so long a time. He thought, therefore, 
of killing one of these lamas ; and for that 
purpose he stood close beside the tree, with 
his hatchet of flintin his hand, waitinguntil 
the beast should, perhaps, pass so close to 
him, that he might strike it with hishatchet. 

It happened as he expected. These ani- 
mals, walking on without suspicion, and 
probably having never been disturbed by 
any living creature, passed by, free from 
the least dread of danger, close to the tree 
where Robinson stood in ambuscade ; and 
one of the smallest of them coming within 
his reach, he gave it so effectual a stroke on 

ftifc 



138 THE NEW 

the nape of the neck, that he laid it dead 
in a moment. 

Harriet. Oh fy ! how could he do so ? 
The poor little sheep ! 

Mrs. Bill. And why should he not, 
Harriet ? 

Harriet. Nay the poor little thing had 
done him no harm, however; and so he 
might very well have let it live. 

Mrs. Bill. Certainly, he might so ; but 
he had occasion for the flesh of this animal 
for his food and nourishment; and dost 
thou not know that God hath permitted 
us to make use of animals whenever we 
have the like occasion ? 

Mr. Bill. To kill any living creature 
without necessity, or to torture it, even 
barely to teaze it, is cruelty, and no good 
person will do so; but to draw all the ad- 
vantage possible from them, and even to 
, kill them and use their flesh for our nou- 
rishment, is not forbidden. Besides, do 
not you know, as I explained to you the 

other . 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 139 1 

other day, that it is very well for animals 
that we should deal thus with them ? 

Rich. Ah! very true; if we had no oc- 
casion for animals, we should not take care 
of them, and in that case they would not 
be near so well off as at present. How 
many of them would be starved to death 
in a hard winter ! 

Henry. Yes ;' and they would suffer 
still more if they were not killed, but left 
to die of sickness and old age, because they 
cannot assist each other as men do. 

Mr. Bill. Again, we must not suppose 
that the death to which we put animals 
causes them a great deal of pain. They 
are not sensible beforehand that they are 
going to be killed, so that they are quiet 
and contented to the very last moment ; 
and the feeling of pain, while they are kil- 
ling, is soon past. 

Robinson never thought of asking him- 
self how he was to dress the flesh of this 
young lama, until the moment that he had 
killed it. 

Harriet, . 



140 THE NEW 

Harriet. Dear me ! could not he boil 
it or roast it ? 

Mr. Bill. That is what he would have 
done with all his heart, but, unfortunately, 
he had not a single article for the purpose ; 
he hajl neither pot nor spit, and what is 
worse, he had not even fire. 

Harriet. No fire? Why, then, all h« 
had to do was to light one. 

Mr. Bill. True, if he had a flint and 
steel, tinder and matches ; but he had 
none of them. 

Rich. I know what I would have done. 

Mr.Bill. What, pray ? 

Rich. I would have rubbed two bits of 
dry woood one against the other, until 
they took fire. I recollect, that is the 
method used by some savage people. We 
read it in a collection of voyages. 

Mr. Bill. Robinson had exactly the 
same idea. K;e took up the lama, there- 
fore, upon his shoulders, and turned his 
steps homewards. 

On the way, he made another discovery, 

which 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 141 

which afforded him infinite joy. This was 
a number of lemon-trees, seven or eight, 
round which, on the ground, he found se- 
veral ripe ones that had fallen. He ga- 
thered them up carefully, marked the spot 
where these trees grew, and, quite happy 
and content with his acquisition, hastened 
home to his habitation. 

There his first business was to skin the 
young lama. He effected this by means 
of a sharp flint, which served him for a 
knife. He stretched the skin in the sun as 
well as he could in order to dry it, because 
he foresaw that it might be of service to him. 

Rich, Why, what could he make of that? 

Mr. Bill. Oh! a great many things. In 
the first place, his shoes and stockings be- 
gan already to be full of holes. He thought 
that, when his shoes were quite gone, he 
might make soles of this skin, and fasten 
them under his feet, so as not to be obliged 
to walk quite barefoot. Besides, the.thoughts 
of winter troubled him not a little, and he 
was glad that he had found a way to furnish 

himself 



142 THE NEW 

himself with fur against the severity of the 
cold. 

It is true, he might have spared himself 
this uneasiness: for, in the country where 
he now was, there was never any winter. 

Geo. Never any winter r 

Mr. Bill. The cold of winter is seldom 
felt in any of those hot climates between 
the two tropics. I was speaking to you 
about them lately ; have you forgot how 
they are called ? 

Henry. The Torrid Zone. 

Mr. Bill. Right. — However, to make 
amends for this want of winter, they have, 
during two or three months of the year, in- 
cessant rains. As to Robinson he knew 
nothing of all that, because, in his youth, 
he would not suffer himself to be properly 
instructed. History, geopraphy, and every 
bther improving science, were tiresome 
and hateful to him. 

Rich. But, papa, I think, for all that, 
that we have read once how very high 
mountains, like the Peak of TenerifF, are 

always 



ROBIXSOtt CRUSOE. 143 

always covered -with snow ; and how on 
that ridge of mountains which bounds Chili 
on the East, and extends from Peru to the 
Straits of Magellan, snow is to be seen the 
whole year. It must certainly be always 
winter there; and yet these places are 
between the tropics. 

Mr. Bill. You are right, my dear 
Richard. Situations very high and moun- 
tainous are an exception; for upon the 
tops of these high mountains there is com- 
monly a perpetual snow. Do you remem- 
ber too what I told you of some countries 
in the East Indies, when we lately went 
over them on the map ? 

Rich. Yes ; that, in some countries there 
summer and winter are but two or. three 
leagues asunder. In the island of Ceylon, 
which belongs. to the Dutch; and there 
also — where — where was it? 

Mr. Bill. In the peninsula on this side 
of the Ganges; for when, on one side of 
the Gaut mountains, it is winter, namely, 
upon the coast of Malabar, on the other 

side 



144 TJIZ.NEW. 

side of those mountains, that is, upon the 
coast of Coromandel, it is summer, and so 
alternately. The same is the case also in 
the island of Ceram, one of the Moluccas, 
where a man needs only to travel three 
leagues to get out of winter into summer, 
or out of summer into winter. 

But here have we travelled very far from 
our friend Robinson. Observe how, at 
one spring, our thoughts can transport 
themselves in the twinkling of an eye to 
places distant from us by many thousands 
of leagues. From America we have taken 
a flight to Asia, and now — take care — hey 
pass ! we are back again in America, at 
Robinson Crusoe's island. Is not this 
wonderful ! 

After he had skinned the lama, taken 
out its bowels, and cut off a hind quarter 
to roast, his first care was to provide a spit. 
For this he cut down a young slender 
willow-tree, peeled off the rind, and made 
it sharp at one end ; after which he chose 
a couple of forked branches to hold up the 

spit, 



- - ROBIMSOX CRTJSOE. 145 

spit. Having cut them of an equal length, 
and sharp at the ends, he stuck them into 
the ground, opposite to each other; put the 
joint on the spit, which he then laid on the 
two forked sticks; and great indeed was 
his joy when he saw how well his spit went 
round. 

He wanted nothing now but, what is 
most necessary of all, fire. In order to 
produce it by rubbing, he cut two pieces 
of wood from a dry trunk, and immediately 
fell to work. He rubbed so briskly, that 
the sweat ran down his face in great drops • 
but he could not accomplish his purpose; 
for when the wood was heated until it 
smoked, just then he found himself so fa- 
tigued, that he was under an absolute ne- 
cessity to stop a few moments and recover 
strength; in the meantime, the wood 
cooled a little, and his whole labour be- 
came useless. 

Here again he had a lively instance of 
the helplessness of man in a state of soli- 

Vol. I. G * thde, 



UO" THE XEW 

tude, and what mighty advantages the so- 
ciety of other men affords us. 

He wanted but another man to go on 
rubbing when he was tired, and then he 
certainly, would have set the piece of wood 
on fire; but those interruptions, which he 
could not avoid, rendered the thing impos- 
sible. 

Rich. And yet I always thought that the 
savages produced fire by rubbing. 

Mr. Bill. So they do. But then these 
savages are generally much stronger than 
we Europeans, who are brought up a great 
deal too delicately. In the next place, 
they know better how to set about it. They 
take two pieces of different wood, one soft, 
the other hard, and they rub the latter with 
a great deal of rapidity against the former, 
which, at length, takes fire. Or else, again, 
, they make a hole in one of the bits of wood, 
into which they put the end of the other, 
and then turn it between their hands, with 
so quick and incessant a motion, that at 
length it begins to burn. 

Of 



ROBINSON CRUSOE 147 

Of all this Robinson knew not one tittle, 
and therefore did not succeed. 

At last he threw away the pieces of wood, 
sat down upon his bed of hay in a m-elan- 
choly mood, supporting his head upon his 
hand, and, sighing heavily, cast a look t\o\r 
and then upon the fine joint of meat which 
was likely now to remain on the spit with- 
out roasting. Then suddenly reflecting 
what would become of him in winter if he 
had no fire, he felt such piercing anxiety 
at the thought, that he was obliged to rise 
precipitately and walk about, in order to 
breathe more at his ease. 

As his spirits were a good deal agitated, 
he grew thirsty, and went to the spring 
with a cocoa nut shell to fetch some water. 
With this he mixed the juice of a .lemon* 
which made a most excellent drink, and 
afforded him unspeakable refreshment in a 
mo mien t when he stood extremely in need 
of it. 

In the* mean time, the sight of his meat 

upon the spit made his mouth water; he 

G 2 ardently 



148 THE NEW 

ardently longed for a little slice of it. He 
recollected at length to have heard that 
the Tartars put the meat which they mean 
to eat under their horses saddles, and so 
.bake it, as it were, at full gallop. This, said 
he to himself, might be done as well by 
another method, and he resoled to try. 

No sooner said tlian done. He went to 
seek two pieces of stone, pretty broad and 
smooth, of the same sort as that of which 
his hatchet was made. Between these two 
stones he placed a piece of meat that had 
no hones, and began immediately to strike 
without intermission upon the uppermost 
stone with his stone mallet. After he had 
done this for five or six minutes, the stone 
began to grow hot, which made him con- 
tinue to strike with redoubled activity, so 
that in less than half an hour, the meat, 
partly by the heat of the stone, and partly 
by the pressure and weight of tbe blows, 
was grown quite tender and fit to eat. 

No doubt the taste of it was not altoge- 
ther so good as if it had been properly 

roasted ; 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 149 

loasted; but to Robinson, who had been so 
long a time without tasting meat, it was a 
delicious morsel. " O you," he cried, 
" O you amongst my countrymen, whose 
delicate stomachs are often qualmish at the 
sight of the best food in the world, if it 
does not exactlysuit the depravedsensuality 
of your appetites, if you were only a week 
in my place, how contented would you be 
all the rest of your lives with whatever food 
Providence should send you ! How careful 
would you be of despising good victuals, 
and of shewing your ingratitude to the al'U 
nourishing bounty of Heaven!" 

In order to make this meat more savoury, 
he squeezed a little lemon juice upon it, 
and then he made such a meal as he had 
not made for a long time. Neither did he 
forget to thank, from the bottom of his 
heart, the Author of all Goodness for this 
new benefit. 

When he had made an end of eating, he 

debated in his own mind what work would 

be the most necessary to set about. The 

G 3 dread 



\50 THE NEW 

dread of winter, which had but a little be- 
fore affected him so strongly, made him 
think of taking or killing- a great number 
of lamas, merely to provide himself with 
skins; and, as these animals seemed to be 
exceedingly tame, he hoped to accomplish' 
this intent without much trouble. 

With this hope he went to bed, and a 
.sound refreshing sleep repaid him richly for 
all his fatigues during the day, 



SIXTH EVENING, 



MR. BILLINGSLEY continued the story 
of Robinson Crusoe in these words : 

Our friend Robinson slept till it was pret- 
ty far in the day. lie was frightened, when 
he awoke, to find it so late, and, rising 
briskly, he was going directly to take the 

field 



ROKINSON CRUSOE. 151 

field against the lamas; but the heavens 
did not permit him. 

For no sooner did he put his head out 
of the cave, than lie was obliged to draw 
it in again. 

Harriet. How was that papa? 

Mr. Bill. It rained as hard as it could 
pour, so that there was no possibility of 
going out. He resolved, therefore to wait 
until the shower was over. 

But there appeared no likelihood of this; 
on the contrary, it grew more and more 
violent. It was accompanied also with 
lightning so bright, that his cave, which 
commonly was pretty dark, seemed to be 
all in a blaze,; and then the flashes were 
followed by such claps of thunder as he had 
never heard. The earth trembled under 
the storm, and the echoes of the mountains 
repeated the sound of the thunder so often, 
that the tremendous roar seemed to be with- 
out end. 

As Robinson had not received a good 
G 4 educa- 



J 52 THE NEW 

education, it was natural enough for him 
to be foolishly afraid of the storm, 
- Geo. What, afraid of thunder and light- 
ning ? 

Mr. BllL Yes, so frightened, that he did 
not know where to hide himself. 

Geo. Why, it is something grand; how 
could it frighten him? 

Mr. Bill. I cannot well assign a reason 
for this fear. Perhaps it is, that the col" 
lection of sulphur, salt, and nitre, which 
produces the explosion of thunder, by tak- 
ing fire, does, sometimes, in its course, set 
buildings on fire, and destroy the lives of 
those who are exposed to it. 

Rich. Yes ; but these accidents are very 
rare. 

Mr. Bill. Besides, how many advantages 
does the storm bring with it! It purges 
the air of sulphureous vapours; it renders 
tfic air much purer and fitter to promote 
the vegetation of plants ; the burning heat 
of the weather it renders cool and tempe- 
rate ; 



ROBINSON CRVSOE. 155 

rate ; and, last of all, it presents us with the 
grandest and most awful spectacle in nature. 

Harriet. I love to see the lightning 
dearly. Papa, will you let us go out with 
you when it thunders, that we may ob- 
serve the course of the lightning? 

M)\ Bill. With ail my heart.— Robin- 
son, as } T ou remember, had been ill-in- 
structed in his youth. This was the reason 
why he knew not how great an advantage 
storms are ; how they clear the air, and 
make every tbing grow better in the fields 
and gardens ; and how, consequently, they 
contribute to refresh and give, as it were, 
new life to both men and animals, trees 
and plants. 

During the storm, he sat in a corner of 
his- cave, with his hands clasped together, 
and oppressed with most dreadful anxiety. 
The rain, mean while, ran down in streams, 
the lightnings flashed, and the thunder 
roared incessantlv. It was almost .nooii. 
day, and the violence of the storm had not, 
in the leasts abated. 

G 5 Robinson. 



154 THE NEW 

Robinson was not hungry; his terror bad 
entirely taken away bis appetite ; but bis 
imagination was disquieted with tbe most 
frightful ideas. 

" The time is come," said be to himself, 
"when God will make me suffer the pu- 
nishment due to my transgressions. He has 
with drawn from me his fatherty protection. 
I shall perish ; I shall never behold my 
poor parents again." 

Mr. Mfired. I must confess, I am not 
vrell pleased at all with my friend Robin- 
son this time. 

Echo. Why not, Sir? 

Mr. Me red. Had not his merciful Crea- 
tor done enough already in his favour, to 
convince him that he never forsakes those 
who trust in him sincerely, and whose con- 
trition is undissembled ? Had he not saved 
him from the most imminent peril of 
death? Had he not already assisted him in 
such a manner, that he had ample reason 
never to fear perishing with hunger? — And 

yet 



KOBINSON CRUSOE. lOJ 

yet to be so desponding! Fy, fy ! It. has 
not a good aspect. 

Mrs. Bill. I am of your opinion, Mr, 
Meredith; nevertheless, let us have com- 
passion on the poor youth. It was but very 
lately that he had begun to think at all, and, 
consequently, it was impossible for him to 
have made so great a progress as one who 
had studied from his earliest years to be- 
come always wiser and better. 

Mr. Bill. My dear, you are right. Your 
compassion for poor Robinson is as just as 
it is worthy of your tender nature. I my- 
self begin to have a considerable regard 
for him, as he has been some time past in 
the right way. 

While he sat thus desponding, over- 
whelmed with trouble and disquiet, the 
storm, at length, began to abate. As the 
claps of thunder became less loud, and the 
rain came down lighter, hope by degrees 
revived in his breast. He thought h/<* 
should now be able to set out on his expe- 
dition against the lamas, and was grjitig to 
G 6 take 



156 THE NEW 

take his hatchet and hig bag, when, all at 
once — what do you think? — he fell hack' 
wards, quite stunned and senseless. 

Rich. Hey-day ! What was the matter 
with him, then? 

Mr. Bill. Exactly over his head there 
burst the terrihlest noise imaginable: the 
earth trembled, and Ptobinson was thrown 
backwards, and fell like a dead man. It 
seems the lightning had struck against the 
tree which grew on the top of the cave, and 
shattered it all to pieces, with a sound so 
tremendous as deprived poor Robinson of 
his senses, and he actually thought he was 
killed. 

He remained on the ground a conside- 
rable time before he recovered his senses. 
At, length, perceiving that he wasstiil alive, 
he rose up, and the first object that he be- 
held before the door of Ins cave was part 
of the tree which the lightning had torn in 
pieces, and thrown down. A fresh misfor- 
tune for Robinson. How was he now to 

fasten 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 137 

fasten bis ladder of ropes, if the whole tree 
was broken down, as he thought it was? .. 

As the rain had now totally ceased, and 
the thunder was no longer heard, he took 
courage, at last, to go out; and then what 
did he see? 

That which, in a moment, filled him 
with gratitude and love to wards his Creatorj 
and covered himwith confusion forsuffering: 
himself to fall into despondency, as he had 
done. You must know the trunk of the tree 
which had been struck by the lightning 
was all on fire. Thus Robinson found him- 
self, in a moment, master of that which he 
had most wanted; and thus Divine Provi- 
dence had taken the most particular care 
of him, exactly at the moment when he ima- 
gined, in his despair, that he was entirely 
abandoned. Full of inexpressible feelings 
of joy and gratitude, he lifted up his hands 
towards Heaven, and, shedding a flood of 
tears, he thanked, with a loud voice, the af- 
fectionate Father of the Universe, who go- 
verns all, and who, even when he permits, 

the 



158 THE NEW 

the most terrifying events to take placie, 
acts ever by the wisest and most charitable 
reasons. " Oh !" said he, i; what, then, is 
man, this poor worm of the earth, whose 
views are so confined? Whit is he, to dare 
to murmur against that which God hath 
brought to pass by means inscrutable to 
all mankind?'* 

From that time he had fire, without hav- 
ing had the least trouble in lighting it; 
from that time it was easy for him to keep 
the fire in ; and from that time he had rea- 
son to be less uneasy about his subsistence 
in this desert island. The design that he 
had upon the lamas was dropped for to-day, 
because Robinson was desirous to make 
use of the fire immediately, and roast his 
meat, which had been upon the spit ever 
since yesterday. 

\ As the fire had not yet reached the lower 
part of the tree, to which his ladder of ropes 
was fastened, he could mount in perfect 
security. He did so, took a burning splin- 
ter of the tree, descended again into the en- 
closure 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 159 

closure before his cave, kindled a good fire 
under his meat, and then climbed up once 
more to put out that which was still burn- 
ing in the trunk of the tree. This he 
effected in a short time. 

And now he set about performing the 
duty of a cook. He tended the fire and 
turned the spit very carefully. The sight 
of the fire rejoiced him infinitely; he look- 
ed upon it as a precious gift which God 
had sent him from the clouds, and while 
he reflected on the great advantages that 
he should enjoy from the possession of it, 
his eyes were often turned with gratitude 
towards Heaven. And during the rest of 
his life, as often as he saw or thought of 
fire, he never failed to say within himself] 
" That also God gave me" 

Mr. MtrecL Fire, which preserves all 
that breathe on this earth, is an emblem of 
the Divinity; it is the noblest of all ele- 
ments. 

Air. Bill. Hence it is that the worship 
of fire hath been very common amongst the 

ignorant 



160 THE NEW 

ignorant pagans. At Rome it was preserv- 
ed in the temple of Vesta; at Athens, in 
that of Minerva; at Delphi, in that of 
Apollo; and you must remember how 
much it was reverenced in Persia. 

Mr. Mcred. Yes, but thank Heaven we 
are better instructed, and know that fire 
is not God, but a gift of God's bounty, 
like water, earth, and air, winch he hath 
created from the love he bears us. 

Mr. Bill. Robinson, during his repast the 
day before, had only regretted the want of 
salt, which would have improved the taste 
of the meat that he dressed by blows of the 
mallet. He hoped, however, in time to find 
some salt in his island ; for the present he 
contented himself with going to the shore, 
and bringing home, in a cocoa-nut shell, 
some sea water, with which he sprinkled 
his meat several times, salting it in this 
manner, in default of a better. 

His meat was now done. The joy with 
which he cut off the first slice, and put the 
first bit into his mouth, cannot be describ- 
ed, 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. l6\ , 

ed, but by one, who, like him, should not 
have tasted for a month before a single 
mouthful of meat properly drest, and who 
should have almost given up the hopes of 
ever tasting any such again. 

After this, the main point was how to 
keep in his fire always. 

Geo. That he could easily manage by 
adding constantly fresh wood. 

Mr. Bill. Very good. But at night, 
while he was asleep, if there came a sudden 
shower, what was he to do then ? 

Harriet. But, papa, I'll tell you what; 
I would have made the fire in my cave 
where the rain could not come. 

Mr. Bill. No bad thought. But, unfor- 
tunately his cave was so small; that it just 
served him to lie down in: and, then, 
chimney he had none; so that the smoke 
would have been exceedingly inconvenient 
to him; he could not have borne it. 

Harriet. Nay, in that case I do not 
know how to assist him. 

Rich. What a terrible situation! There 

must 



I #2 THE NEW 

must always happen something to puzzle 
poor Robinson. One would tliink, now and 
then that he was made completely happy ; 
but, yonr humble servant, something new 
comes all at once to cross him. 

Mr. Bill. This may shew you how ex- 
tremely difficult it is for one man singly to 
provide for all his own necessities, and how 
great the ad vantages are that we enjoy from 
civil life. My dear children, we should be 
but poor miserable beings, if we were 
obliged each of us to live by himself, and 
if nobody were to receive any assistance 
from his fellow creatures. A thousand 
hands arc not sufficient to prepare what 
each of us wants every day. 

R ich . Oh ! pa p a ! — 

Mr. Bill. What, do you think that in- 
credible? Well, let us reckon how many 
things you have had occasion for this day. 
In the fii st place, you have slept till sun- 
rise this morning, and that on a good bed. 

Rfch. With a mattress underneath. 

Mr. BilL Very well. Mattresses are 

stuffed 



ROBINSON CRUSOE, 1 63 

stuffed with horse-hair: this horse-hair re- 
quires two hands to cut it, two more to 
weigh and sell it, two to pack it up and 
send it off, two to receive it and unpack it, 
and two, again, to sell it to the saddler or 
upholsterer: lastly, the upholsterer's hands 
find employment in picking it and filling- 
the mattress with il. The cover of this 
mattress is ticking; where has that been 
made? 

Rich, At the weavers. 

Mr. Bill. And how? 

Rich. In a loom, with thread, and a 
shuttle, and paste, and — 

Mr. Bill. That is enough. How many 
hands did it take to make the loom? Let 
us be moderate, and say, for instance, 20. 
Paste is made of flour. What a number of 
things must be done, before we can have 
flour ! How many hundreds of hands must 
be moved, to make every thing that be- 
longs to a mill, where wheat is ground into 
flour!— -But to return to the weaver: thread 

is 



lfri THE NEW 

is what he principally uses; where does 
he get this ? 

Rich. From the women who spin it. 

Mr. Bill. Out of what ? 

Rich. Flax. 

Mr. Bill. And do you know, again, 
through how many hands flax must pass 
before it can be spun ? 

Rich, Oh yes, we were reckoning that 
lately. In the first place, the husbandman 
sifts the flax seed, that it may not be mixed 
with tares: then the land must be dunged 
and ploughed twice ; after which they sow, 
and then harrow. Next, when the flax be- 
gins to sprout up, a number of women and 
girls come to weed it. Again, when it grows 
to a proper height, they pluck up the stalks, 
and ripple them, in order to pull off the 
little round heads that contain the seed. 

Edw. Yes, and then they tie the stalks 
together in bundles, and steep them in! 
water. 

Henry. And when the bundles have been 

steeped 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 1&5 

steeped long enough, they take them up 
out or the water. 

Geo. And spread them in the sun to dry. 

Charlotte. Then they clear the flax from 
the hulls with a break. 

Harriet. Not yet, my dear Charlotte; 
it must be well pounded first. 

Charlotte. Very true, and then they 
break it, and then — 

Rick. And then they scutch it, and then 
they hackle it to separate it from the tow. 

Mr. Bill. Now, put together all these 
tilings, which must necessarily be done be- 
fore we can have linen ; consider, also, how 
many sorts of different labours are required 
to make the instruments used by the hus- 
bandman, the flax-dresser, and the spinner; 
and you must own I do not exceed the 
truth in saying that more than a thousand 
hands have been employed in the making 
of your mattress. 

Geo. A thousand hands! It is wonder- 
ful, and yet it is very true. 

Mr, Bill. In the next place, consider how 

many 



166 THE NEW 

many things you have daily occasion for. 
and then pray tell me, should it surprise us 
that Robinson Crusoe found himself every 
now and then puzzled and at a stand, when 
not another hand in the world but his own 
worked for him, and when he had not a 
single one of those instruments by means 
of which things in this part of the world 
are so easily and expeditiously made. 

At this time, therefore, what puzzled him 
was the finding of some method or other to 
hinder his dear fire from going out. Some- 
times he scratched his head as if he would 
have plucked a lucky thought out of it; 
again, letting his hands fall, he would walk 
backwards and forwards in his enclosure, 
not knowing what to have recourse to. At 
last he fixed his eyes by chance on the rock 
at the ec)ge of his cave, and that moment 
the thought struck him how he was to act. 

Henry. Eh ! how was that? 

Mr, Bill. There projected out of the 
rock, about a yard from the ground, a 
very large and thick ledge of stone. 

Charlotte. 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. \Gj 

Charlotte. How large might it be ? 

Mr, Bill. Why really I have not been 
able to procure the exact proportions of 
it; but I will suppose, at a guess, that it 
was about as long as I am, its breadth and 
thickness might be a yard and a half. 

Though it had rained very hard, the 
ground under this large piece of the rock 
was perfectly dry. Robinson saw at once 
that this spot would answer every purpose 
of a fire-place, being completely sheltered 
from all accidents ; but he saw, moreover, 
that it would require no great trouble to 
make a proper kitchen under the stone, 
together with hearth and chimney, and 
therefore resolved to go immediately to 
work about it. 

With his spade he hollowed the ground 
under the great stone, about a yard deep. 
After that, he conceived the idea of en- 
closing this ground, at the side, with two 
small walls reaching up to the stone itself, 
Geo. But how could he make walls? 
Mi\ EilL He had been accustomed, yon 

know 



168 THE NEW 

know, minutely to remark every thing that 
he met with, and he always asked himself 
the question, " What use may he made of 
this?!* He had, amongst other things, ob- 
served a particular sort of clay in one part 
of his island, upon sight of which he imme- 
diately said to himself, " Perhaps this clay 
would make good bricks, if ever I should 
have occasion to build a Wall.*' 

At that moment he recollected the clay, 
and, having nearly finished hollowing out 
his kitchen, he took his spade and his 
knife of flint, and repaired to the spot 
where this clay was to be found, in order 
to set about the work without delay. 

The heavy rain had made the clay so 
soft, that he found no difficulty in shaping- 
it to the form of bricks, and cutting it 
smooth with his knife. After preparing a. 
pretty g*ood number of these bricks in a 
short time, he placed them, beside each 
other, in a spot w here the sun shone all day. 
He determined to go on with this work the 
next day, and in the mean time returned 

home 



R0B1.VS0X CRUSOE. l69 

home to eat the rest of his roast meat, the 
eagerness with which he had worked hav- 
ing sharpened his appetite. That he might 
regale himself in a princely manner on 
such a day of rejoicing as the present, he 
indulged himself by adding to his supper 
a cocoa-nut from the mall num ber of 
those that still remained. 

The repast was excellent. " Ah!" said 
Robinson, sighing from the bottom of his 
heart, which was partly content and partly 
sorrowful, " Ah ! how happy should I be 
at this moment, if I had but one single 
friend, merely a man, were it the most 
miserable beggar in the world, to bear me 
company; one single man, whom I might 
call my friend, while I professed to him an 
equal friendship ! Had I, at least, the hapo 
piness of being master of some tame animal, 
a dog or a cat, to whom I might shew kind- 
ness in order to gain its affection ! But to 
live thus solitary, absolutely cut off from 
every living creature, and as if I were the 

Vol. I. H only 



170 THE NEW 

only being upon the earth!" Here a 

few tears dropped down his cheeks. 

He then recalled to memorv the time, 
wheH, having it in his power to enjoy the 
sweet society of his brothers and other com- 
panions, he nevertheless had frequently 
quarrelled and disputed with them : the 
recollection of this filled him with bitter 
sorrow. il Ah!" said he to himself, " how 
little I then knew the value of a friend, and 
the impossibility of doing without the love 
and esteem of our neighbours, if we would 
live happy ! Oh, if I could now begin to 
pass those days over again, with what com- 
plaisance and good-nature would I behave 
towards my brothers and other children ! 
How patiently would I put up with small 
offences, and how would I exert myself to 
charm every body with my gentleness and 
good behaviour, and force them to love 
me in their turn ! Heavens! Why did I 
not know how to value the happiness of 
friendship until Ihad lost that happiness — 
alas! lost it for everr" 

With 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 171 

With these words he turned his eye sac 
cidentally towards the entrance of his little 
lodge, and perceived a spider which had 
spread its web in a corner. The thought 
of lying under the same roof with some 
living creature so filled him with joy, that 
he did not trouble himself in the least 
about the species of the animal. He re- 
solved to catch flies every day for this 
spider, to shew it that it lived in a place 
of freedom and friendship, and in order 
to make it tame, if it was possible. 

As it was still day, and the air, freshened 
by the storm, was infinitely agreeable to 
the sense, Robinson did not chuse to go to 
bed yet, and, that he might employ the 
time in something useful, he took up his 
spade again, and began to hollow out the 
ground for his kitchen. In doing this, lie 
struck all at once upon something hard 
that was in the earth, and was very near 
breaking his spade. 

He took it at first for a stone ; but what 

was his astonishment, when, haying drawn 

H2 out 



172 THE Nl.W 

out a great heavy lump of something, he 
discovered it to be — pure gold ! 

Rich. Gracious ! Well, he certainlv has 
surprising luck, this Mr. Robinson Crusoe. 

Mr. Bill. Surprising luck, indeed! This 
mass of gold was so thick, that, had it been 
coined, it would have produced upwards 
of 10,0001. Behold him, therefore, at.pre- 
sent, a man of vast fortune ! What a num- 
ber of things could he procure himself 
now ! He could build himself a fine house, 
he could have a carriage, horses, footmen, 
apes, monkies; he could 

Geo. Ay; but where was he to have all 
these tilings in his island? There was no- 
body there that had any thing to sell. 

Mr. Bill. Oho! I had forgot— Robin- 
son, however, did not; so that, instead of 
rejoicing for the treasure that he had found, 
he kicked it from him with contempt, and 
said, "Lie there, miserable metal, which 
men in general covet so greedily, and 
which they purchase with so many base 
actions and even crimes! Of what use art 

thou

thou to me? Oh ! that, in thy place, I had 
found a good lump of iron, with which I 
might, perhaps, have made myself a hatchet 
or a knife ! How willingly would I give 
thee for a handful of iron nails, or for 
some useful instrument I" — He left, there- 
fore, all this precious treasure lying neglect- 
ed on the ground, and afterwards, as he 
passed by, scarce thought it worth a look. 

Harriet. Til tell you what, papa : he 
did exactly as the cock did. 

Mr; Bill. What cockr 

Harriet. Oh! do you forget the fable 
that you read to us one day ? Once upon 
a time there was a cock

Harriet. That scratched upon a dung- 
hill, and found a — what was it? 

Mr. Bill. A pearl ? 

Harriet. Ah ! yes ; a pearl — And then 
he said, " Of what use art thou to me with 
all thy brightness ! If I had found, instead 
of thee, a grain of barley, it would have 
been of much more service to me." Saying:

this, be left the pearl on the ground, and 
went away without taking any farther no- 
tice of it* 

Mr. Bill. Very good. Just so did Ro- 
binson with the lump of gold. 

Night now came on. The sun had for 
some time sunk beneath the main— 
Geo. What, in the sea? 
Mr. Bill. So it appears to those who 
Jive in an island, and see nothing round 
them but water. The sun, m fact, seems 
to them to sink do'wn into the sea at night 
when besets; and, therefore, people some- 
times express themselves thus, a^ if the 
thing were really so. 

The moon rose, bright at the other end 
of the heavens, and shone so beautifully 
into Robinson's cave, that the delightfui- 
ness of the view hindered him from going 
to sleep. 

Harriet. Oh ! look, look, dear papa ; 
our moon too begins to appear yonder. 

Rich. Oh! what an enchanting sight ! 
how mild her light is j how pleasing !

ROBINSON CRUSOE. 17 - 

Mr. Bill. Well, my dears, Robinson is 
asleep, while his fire, kept up by large 
pieces of wood, continues to burn slowly. 
Now, what do you think of doing in the 
mean time? 

Edw. I think, at least, that I shall hardly 
sleep much to night, I am so impatient to 
know the rest of R,obinson's adventures. 



SEVENTH EVENING. 



JL HE following evening, before Mr. Bit- 
lingsley began the continuation of Robin- 
son Crusoe's history, he expressed himself 
thus: I hope, my dear children, that, in-rfc 
lating this history to you, I do not detain 
you from any employment more agreeable 
or improving. I would not put the least 
constraint on you; so that whenever our 
friend Robinson grows tiresome to you — 
H4 Edw. 



l?f> - THE NEW 

K(h\ Tiresome, p::pa! It is impossible. 

Mr. BUI. However, I observed some of 
yon, yesterday evening-, gape and yawn a 
good deal. 

Geo. Oh! papa, the reason of that was, 
that we had worked very hard in our gar- 
dens all the afternoon, so that it was no 
wonder if we were a little sleepy towards 
night.. 

Edw. To-day we have only been weed- 
ing and watering our lettuce- beds, so that 
we are quite fresh. 

Harriet. Oh! quite fresh, papa; look 
how I can jump. 

Mr. Bill. Well; you have only to tell 
me whenever this story begins to grow 
heavy or dull. 

Rich. Oh; never fear ; I'll warrant you. 

Mr. BUI. Then I proceed. 

As the heat was excessive in Robinson's 
island during the day time, he was obliged, 
whenever he undertook any thing-laborious, 
to work at it very early in the morning, or 
else in the cool of the evening. He rose, 

therefore, 



ROBINSON CRUSO£. 1/7 

therefore, before the sun, put fresh wood 
to his lire, and ate the half of a cocoa-nut 
that he had left since the evening before. 
After this he intended to have put another 
joint of his lama on the spit ; but he found 
the flesh already tainted, on account of 
the extraordinary heat. He was, there- 
fore, obliged to go without the pleasure of 
eating meat for that day. 

Upon this, he prepared to set out for the 
clay-pit; and, putting on his pouch, he 
found still remaining in it the potatoes 
which he had brought home two days be- 
fore. He resolved to try the experiment 
of dressing them ; so put them down close 
by his fire, and having covered them with 
hot ashes, he set out. 

He worked so hard, that before twelve 
o'clock he had prepared as many bricks as 
he thought he should have occasion for, to 
complete the wall of his kitchen. He next 
went down to the beach to look for some 
oysters; but instead of oysters, of which he 
H 5 found- 



3 78 THE new 

found only very few, he discovered, to his- 
great joy, another sort of food, much bet- 
ter than any that he had found yet. 

Rich. What was that, papa ? 

Mr. Bill. It was an animal, the flesh of 
which, it is true, he had never tasted; but 
he had frequently heard that it was the 
most wholesome and delicious imaginable. 

Rich . We 1 1 , t h e n ,- w hat was i t ? 

Mr. Bill. A turtle, and so large, that 
it is rare to see the like in those parts. It 
might weigh 1001b. 

Geo. Why, it must have been a mon- 
ster of a turtle. Are there really such 
great ones ? 

Rich. Oh ! yes ; and much larger still. 
Have you forgot what papa read from 
Captain Cook's Voyages. The turtle that 
his people found in the South Seas weighed 

Geo. 3001b. — astonishing! ' 
Mr. Bill: Robinson loaded his shoulders 
with his prize, and marched slowly home- 
wards. 



R©BINSON CRUSOE. 179 

wards. — When he arrived at bis cell, his first 
care was to come at the flesh of the turtle, 
which he did, at length, bycuttingopen,with 
his hatchet, the lower shell that covered 
its belly ; he then killed it, and cut off a 
good part of it to roast, which, having fixed 
upon the spit, he waited with impatience 
until it was done, for his work had con- 
siderably sharpened his appetite. 

While he turned the spit, he considered 
with himself what he must do w T ith th'e rest 
of the turtle to keep it from tainting. To 
salt it would have been the only effectual 
wav, but then he had neither tub nor salt. 

It filled him with concern to think that 
all that fine turtle, the flesh of which would 
nourish him for more than a week, must be 
unfit to eat the next day ; and yet he could 
not think of any expedient to save it. All 
at once a thought struck him. The upper 
shell of the turtle was shaped like a large 
bowl. " That," said he, " shall serve me 
H 6 for 



180 THE XLVS 

for a trough to salt it in— but uhcre is tire 
salt ? 

" Only think, what a great fool I must 
he !" cried he, striking his hand against his 
head ; i( cannot I steep this meat in sea-wa- 
ter, and will not that have the same effect, 
or nearly so, that brine would have? A 
lucky thought ! a lucky thought !" cried 
he : and his joy made him turn the spit 
twice as fast as before. 

* His turtle was now nicely done. " Ah !" 

said Robinson, sighing, after he had tasted, 

with much satisfaction, a small bit of it 

which he thought very savoury, "if one 

. had the least morsel of bread with this! How 

stupid was I in my youth, not to know 

that we shoula thank God for a bit of 

dry bread ! I was seldom contented if 

my bread was not loaded with butter, and 

even then, perhaps, I must have cheese 

Oh idiot that L was ! 'How happy should I 

now be with a piece of the blackest rye 

bread that ever was made in my country ! : ' 

While 



ROBINSON CBUSOE. 181 

While he was taken up with these reflec- 
tions, he recollected the potatoes that he 
had left in the ashes before he went out in 
the morning. " Let us see," said he," how 
they will turn out ;" and he took np one 
of them. 

Here was new cause of rejocing ! The 
fruit, which was before so hard, was now 
become quite tender; and when he opened 
it, the smell was so pleasing, he never hesi- 
tated to conclude that the taste must be 
equally so. In effect, this root tasted as 
agreeable — as agreeable as — — Eh ! Who 
will help mc out with a simile ? 

Mr. Mercd. As agreable as a potatoe. 

Air. Bill Even so. That settles it all 
in one word. In short, Robinson perceived 
that this root, which was so agreable to the 
taste, would supply the place of bread, 

lie made, therefore, a magnificent re- 
past ; after which, as the sun was burning* 
hot, he threwhimself on the .bed for a white, 
to consider at his ease what work he 

should 



i 852 THE NEW 

should begin when" the violence of the 
heat was over. 

" What piece of work," said he, " should 
I undertake at present? The sun must 
harden my bricks before I can begin my 
wall. The beet way then, certainly, will 
be to go and kill a couple of lamas — But 
what am I to do with such a quantity of 
meat ?« — What, if I should hangup some of 
it to dry in the smoke of my kitchen ? — 
Excellent!" cried he; and with, these 
words he bounced from his bed, and sat 
down in the front of his intended kitchen, 
to deliberate on the means of succeeding 
in this ;dan. 

He presently saw that the thing might be 
done well enough. He had only to leave 
two hales in the walls that he was to build, 
and through them to run alargestick across, 
Tt was an easy matter 4 to hang his hams and 
flitches noon this, and the smoke of the 
chimney would do the rest. This happy 
thought was near turning his head with 

joy- 



ROBINSON CRUSOE/ 183 

joy. What would he have given that his 
bricks were already hard enough, that he 
might hegin the grand-work that very mo- 
ment! But there was no help for it; he 
must be content to wait until the sun har- 
dened his bricks. 

Something, however, must be done to 
employ the time. While he meditated 
what that should be, a fresh thought struck 
him, which by far surpassed, in cleverness, 
all that he had hitherto conceived. And 
he was astonished at his folly in not hav- 
ing hit upon it before. 

Rich. What was it, then? 
Mr. Bill. No more than this; he resolv- 
ed, in order that he might have company, 
and at the same time provide for his sub- 
sistence, to bring up some tame animals. 
Geo. Ah ! some of the lamas, I dare say. 
Mr. Bill. Right. In fact, these were 
the only animals that he had seen hither- 
to. As these lamas appeared already to be 
extremely tame, he hoped he should suc- 
ceed in taking a couple of them alive. 

Geo. 



184 THE NKW 

Geo. Ohj that would he delightful. I 
should like to he along with him, to have 
another couple. 

Mr. Bill. But pray, George, how would 
you contrive it ? They were hardly so tame 
as to let themselves he caught. 

Geo. Then how did Robinson mean to 
do ? 

Mr. Bill. That was tile very point that 
Robinson had many long and serious deli be* 
rations upon. But man, where an under- 
taking is not in itself absolutely impossible, 
man needs but to mil seriously and with 
perseverance, and nothing is insurmount- 
. able to his understanding and industry; so 
great and manifold are the faculties with 
which our good Creator hath endowed us ! 

Attend to this, my dear children, and 
never despair of success in any labour or 
1 difficulty whatsoever, provided you take 
the firm resolution of not giving over until 
you have accomplished it. Unwearied ap- 
plication, constant reflection, and a courage 
that perseveres in spite of every obstacle, 

have 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 153 

have often brought entei prizes to a period 
which were at first deemed impracticable. 
Never, therefore, sufreryourselvesto be dis- 
couraged by the difficulties which you will 
meet with in the affairs of life ! but always 
reflect that the more exertion it has cost to 
bring a business to a happy issue, the more 
joy one feels at having accomplished it. 

Robinson soon succeeded in hitting upon 
a method to take the lamas alive. 

Rich. What was it ? 

Mr. Bill. He proposed to make a noose 
upon a cord, and, hiding himself behind a 
tree, to throw the noose over the head of 
the first lama that should approach. 

With this intent, he twisted a pretty 
strong cord, and in a few hours the cord 
and the noose were completed: he made 
a trial or two to see whether the noose 
would catch well, and it answered perfectly 
to his wish. 

As the place by w r hich the lamas were 
accustomed to pass, in their way to the wa- 
ter, was pretty far off, and because he was 

not 



186 THE NEW 

not sure whether they would pass by there 
that evening, as it was about noon that he 
saw them go to drink before, he put off 
till next day the execution of his project : 
in the mean time he made the preparations 
requisite for the journey. 

That is^to sa} T , he went to the spot where 
the potatoes grew, and rilled his bag with 
them. Part of them he put down in the 
warm ashes to roast, and the rest he threw 
into a corner of his cave for a future store. 
In the next place he cut off a pretty large 
piece of his turtle to serve for supper and 
the next morning's breakfast, and steeped 
what remained in sea water, which he had 
brought with him for the purpose. 

Lastly, he dug a small hole in the ground,, 
which was to be his cellar, for want of a 
better. In it he placed his turtle shell with 
the salted meat, placed over that the piece 
that he meant to roast for supper, and theiu 
covered the whole with small branches of 
trees. 

Tor the rest of the afternoon, in order to 

refresh 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 157 

refresh bis spirits, he Indulged himself with 
an agreeable walk along the sea side, where 
there blew a line fresh easterly breeze, 
which rendered the air agreeably cool. 
His eyes traversed with pleasure the im- 
mense ocean, whosesurface was thengently 
agitated by small waves following each- 
other In slow succession to the shore. He 
turned his eyes fondly towards the part of 
the world where his dear country was si- 
tuated, and a few trembling tears trickled 
down his cheeks at the remembrance of 
his beloved parents, 

* r W6ai are they doing now, those pooi: 
disconsolate parents?" cried he, bathed in 
tears, and clasping his hands together. 
" If they have survived the bitter sorrow 
which I unhappily have caused them, alas! 
what grief consumes their days ! How must 
they sigh to behold themselvs childless; to 
see their last, their only>.son, become a trai- 
tor to their love, and abandoning them for 
ever ! Oh my dearest, best of fathers ! my 
tender, affectionate mother ! pardon, ah>. 

pardon 



188 THE SEW 

pardon your unhappy son for thus afflicting 
you ! And thou, O Heavenly Father, at 
present my onlyfather, my only society, my 
only support and protector!— [here he th rev/ 
himself upon Lis knees in the posture of 
adoration] — Oh, my Creator, shed thy most 
precious blessing, shed all the happiness 
which thou hast destined forme, and of 
which I have rendered myself unworthy, 
shed them upon my dear parents, whom I 
have so grievously offended, and thus con- 
sole them for their sufferings. Ah! how 
chearfully will I endure whatever dispensat- 
ion it shall please thy wisdom and mercy 
to appoint for me in order to my future 
amendment, could but my poor parents, 
who are innocent, be made happy !" 

He remained a little longer on his knees, 
looking up to Heaven in silent grief, and 
his eyes swimming in tears. At length 
he rose, and, with his knife of flint, he cut 
out upon the tender bark of a tree that 
was at hand, the much-loved names of his 
parents. Over them he pla-ced these words., 

"God 



HO BIN SON CRUSOE 189 

" Cod bless you !° and below, il Mercy to 
your lost son !" After that, his lips, warm 
with affection, kissed the names which he 
had cut out, and he bedewed them with his 
tears. lie afterwards engraved these same 
names, which were so dear to him, upon a 
number of other trees in other parts of the 
island, and, from that time forward, he ge- 
nerally offered up his prayers at the foot 
of one of these trees, and never failed to 
remember his parents in them. 

Geo. For once, I think, he behaved 
well. 

Mr. Bill. He is, at present, in the fairest 
train to become an honest and good man, 
and for this he is indebted to the wise Pro- 
vidence of Heaven which conducted him 
hither. 

■Geo. .He might now, therefore, return to 
his parents, if Providence thought fit. 

Mr. Bill. God, who foresees every thing 
that will happen, knows best what is for 
the advautage of any man, and will regu- 
late the events of his life according. It is 

true 



3 Q0 THE NEW 

true, circumstances have kindled a spark 
of virtue in Robinson's breast, but who 
can tell if other circumstances would not 
quickly extinguish this spark again; and 
if he was at this moment taken from his 
island, and restored to his father's house, 
who knows whether the infection of exam- 
ple and prosperity would not corrupt him 
once more? Oh, my children, how just is 
this precept, " Let him that standeth take 
heed lest he fall!" 

While Robinson walked backwards and 
forwards on the beach, it occurred to him 
that he would do well to bathe himself. 
He therefore took off his clothes; but how 
was he terrified on seeing the condition of 
his shirt, the only one that he had 1 As 
he had worn it without shifting for so long 
it time, and in so hot a climate, one could 
scarcely perceive that the linen had ever 
been white. Wherefore, before he bathed 
himself, he took care to wash this shirt as 
well as possible, and, having hung it upon 
a tree to dry, he jumped into the water. 

He 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. l£l 

He had learned to swim pretty early, 
so that, being-perfect master of the exer- 
cise, he amused himself with swimming out 
to a good distance from shore towards a 
neck of land that extended pretty far into 
the sea, and upon which he had never been 
yet.' 

Charlotte. A neck of land ? What is 
that ? 

Mr. Bill. We give that name to a long 
piece of land, one end of which joins 
an island or a continent, and the other 
stretches out intothe sea. You understand? 

Charlotte. Oh, perfectly. 

Mr. Bill. This thought of Robinson's 
was very lucky ; for he found that the neck 
of land was, during the time of high wa- 
ter, entirely covered, and that, on the eb- 
bing of the tide, a considerable quantity 
of turtles, oysters, and muscles, were left 
behind. This time, indeed, he could not 
•carry any of them away, neither did he 
want them at present, as his kitchen was 
sufficiently stored: however, the discovery 

of 



JC)£ niE NEW 

of them afforded him no small degree of 
satisfaction. 

That part of the sea in which he swam 
abounded with fish so plentifully that he 
could almost have caught them with his 
hands. If lie had had a net'he might have 
taken them by thousands ; however, though 
be had none, he hoped, as he had been 
hitherto so fortunate in all his undertak- 
ings, that he might one day or other be 
master of a fishing net. 

Satisfied with these discoveries, he came 
out of the water, after having been a full 
hour in it. The heat of the sun had en- 
tirely dried his shirt, and he had the plea- 
sure once more of putting on clean linen. 

But, as he had contracted the habit of 
reflecting upon every thing, he considered 
that this pleasure could not last very long; 
for, having but one shirt, he was obliged 
to wear it constantly, and, when it was 
worn out, he had none to replace it. This 
reflection damped his joy a good deal : ne- 
vertheless, he took courage, and after he 

had 



ROBINSON CKUSOE. 193 

had dressed himself, returned to his habita- 
tion, frequently repeating to himself, "The 
Lord be praised for all things !" 

Rich. He is right now not to suffer him- 
self to be cast down or despond, but to put 
a reasonable trust in Providence. 

Harriet Oh, how I should like to see 
Robinson. I am very fond of him. 

Geo. If papa would only give me paper, 
I should like to write him a letter. 

Edzv. So would I too.

MR. Bill. Well, where did we leave 
off last night? 

Henry. Where Robinson went to bed 
after bathing. 

Mr. Bill.^ Oh! right. — Well, then, Ro- 
binson rose thenextmorningearly, and pre- 
pared for the ehace. He furnished his 
pouch with plenty of roasted potatoes, and a 
good large slice of roasted turtle, which he 
wrapped up in the leaves of the cocoa-nut 
tree. Next he slung his hatchet by his 
14. side, 



£00 THE NEW 

side, tied the cord which he had made the 
day before for catching the lamas, round 
his waist, look his umbrella in his hand, 
and began his march. 

It was very early ; he resolved, therefore, 
for this time, to take a round, in order to 
make himself acquainted with some other 
parts of his island. Amongst the numbers 
of various birds that fluttered about the 
trees, he remarked some parrots, the co- 
lours of whose plumage were extraordinary 
beautiful. How did he wish to have one 
of thein that he might tame it, and have it 
for his companion ! But the old ones were 
too cunning to be caught, and he could 
no where discover a nest with young 
ones. He was obliged, therefore, to put 
off the gratification of this wish until some 
other opportunity. 

In return for this disappointment, he dis- 
covered in the course of his walk, a thing 
much more necessary to him than a parrot ; 
for, getting to the top of a hill near the sea- 
side, and looking down between the cracks 

of 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 201 

of the rock, he saw something lie on the 
ground which excited his curiosity. He 
let himself down by the assistance of his 
feet and hands, and found, to his great satis- 
faction, that it was — what do you think ? 

Henry. Pearls, perhaps. 

Rich. Yes, truly, the sight of pearls 
would have given him great satisfaction! 
Perhaps it was iron. 

Edw. Nay, do not you know that iron 
is not to be found in hot climates ? It was* 
perhaps, another lump of gold. 

Harriet. Nonsense! Would that have 
made him glad ? Gold was of no use to 
him you heard before. 

Mr. Bill. I see you will not be able to 
guess, then ; I will tell you. What lie 
found was — salt. 

Hitherto, he had, it is true, in some re- 
spects, supplied the want of salt with sea- 
water; but, after all, that was not salt. The^ 
sea-water has a bitter taste which is very 
disagreeable; and, besides, it was a mistake" 
to think that meat salted in this manner 
I 5 would 



20^ THE N k\V 

M-oukl keep; because sea- water, as well as 
that of a spring or river, grows stinking af- 
ter it lias stood some time. It was, there- 
fore, a very lucky thing that he found some 
real salt, and he filled both his pockets 
with it, in order to supply himself with a 
stock for immediate use. 

Geo. How did that salt come there, papa?. 

Mr. Bill. Then you do not remember 
what I told you one day concerning the 
original of salt? 

Rich. Oh ! yes; I recollect it still. Some 
they take out of the earth, some they make 
of salt-water that flows in springs, and 
some, again, is made from sea- water. 

Mr* Bill. Now, the salt made from 
sea-water is either prepared by men or by 
the sun. 
, Geo, The sun ? 

Mr. Bill. Yes; for when any sea-water 
is left uppn the land, after a high tide, or 
a flood, the sun makes the water by de- 
grees to evaporate, and what remains on 
the spot is then salt. 

Harriet. 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 203 

Harriet. Well, that is comical. 

Mr. Bill. See with what kindness Hea- 
ven provides for us! That which we can 
least do without, does always require the 
least preparation by art, and is always 
found in the greatest abundance. 

Robinson went in high spirits to the 
place where he hoped to noose a lama. 
When he came there, he saw none; but 
then it was not quite noon. He sat clown, 
therefore, at the foot of a trce^ to regale 
himself with his roast turtle and potatoes. 
How much more savoury did they taste to 
him now that he had a little salt to eat 
with them ! 

Just as he had finished his meal, the la- 
mas appeared at a distance, coming towards- 
him with skips and bounds. Robinson 
quickly placed himself in a posture of at- 
tack, and waited with his noose ready for 
the approach of one of the lamas. Several 
had passed him beyond his reach -, but, all 
at once, there came up one so near to him, 
that he scarce needed more than to drop 
I 6 the 



£04 THL NEW 

the noose to have him fast in it. lie did 
so, and that moment the lama was his pri- 
soner. 

The poor beast would have bleated, but 
lest that should frighten the rest, Robin- 
son pulled the noose so tight, that the 
lama was completely silenced. He then 
dragged it as fast as he could into a thick 
coppice to hide it from the rest. 

This lama was a female, and had two 
young ones which followed her, to the 
great satisfaction of Robinson, and did not 
appear to be the least afraid of him. He 
patted the pretty little things, and they — 
just as if they would have begged of him 
to let their mother go — licked his hands. 

Geo. Well, then, I think he might 
have let her go. 

Mr. Bill. He would have been a great 
fool in doing so. 

Geo. Nay, the poor creature had done 
him no harm however. 

Mr. Bill. But he had occasion for it; 
and you know, my dear George, we are 

permitted 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 205 

permitted to make use of animals in case 
of need, provided we do not abuse them. 

Robinson was transported with joy at 
having so happily attained his object. He 
dragged the creature along with all his 
strength, though she jumped and skipped 
a good deal to get from him, and the two 
little ones followed quietly behind. The 
shortest way was now the best for Robin- 
son, and, pursuing that, he at length 
arrived happily at his dwelling-place. 

But here started a difficulty. How was 
he to get the lama into his enclosure, which, 
as we have said before, was so strongly bar- 
ricaded all round ? To sling it down from 
the top of the rock, by means of a cord, was 
not at all advisable ; the poor animal might 
be strangled in the way. Robinson resolv- 
ed, therefore, to makeup a little stable near 
his place of abode, and there to keep this 
lama and her young ones, until he should 
be able to suit his conveniency better. 

In the mean time he fastened the animal 
to a tree, and immediately fell to work ; that 

is 



206 THE NEW 

is to say, he cut down with his hatchet of 
flint a number of young trees, and fixed 
them iu the grouiul so close, one beside 
the other, that they forme! a pretty strong 
wall. While this was doing, the iama lay- 
down through weariness, and the little ones, 
no way troubled at their being prisoners, 
were sucking quite unconcerned, and 
feasting themselves at their ease. 

What a pleasing sight was this to Robin- 
son ! Above a dozen times he stopped from 
his work to look at the pretty little crea- 
tures, and thought himself beyond measure 
happy in having some animated beings to 
bear him company. From this moment his 
life seemed no longer solitary, and the joy 
which he feit from .this reflection, gave 
him such strength and activity, that his 
stable was very soon finished: he then 
put the lama and her young ones into it, 
and closed up the last opening with branches 
firmly interwoven, 

What was his satisfaction now 1 It is im- 
possible for words to describe it. Besides 

the 



HOBINSON CRUSOE. 207 

the company of the lamas, which of itself 
was a valuable thing, he promised himself 
many other great ad vantages, and with much 
reason : for in time he might perhaps learn 
to make some sort of cloathing with the 
wool of these animals; he might use their 
milk for food, he might make butter and 
cheese of it. It is true, he did not yet 
know* by what means he should attain 
these objects, which were still so far dis- 
tant ; but he had already experienced that 
no man should despair of his skill or per- 
formance, provided he gives his whole 
mind to the work, and applies to it with 
persevering attention. 

There wanted still one thing to complete 
his happiness : he wished to be in the same 
enclosure* with his dearlamas, that he might 
have them always before his eyes when he 
was at home, and enjoy the satisfaction of 
seeing them grow fond of his company. 

He puzzled himself a long time to find 
how he should accomplish this: at length, 
his determination was to break down one 

side 



208' THE NEW 

side of his wall of trees, not grudging what- 
ever labour it might cost him, and to make 
another wall that would take in a larger 
space. This alteration, besides, would give 
him more room, and make him more at 
his ease. But in order to be secure from 
all accidents while he was working at his new 
hedge, he prudently resolved not to break 
the old wall until he had finished the new. 

Thanks to his indefatigable pains, the 
work was finished in a few days, and then 
Robinson had the satisfaction of being in 
the same habitation with his three domestic 
companions. This, however, did not make 
him forget his first companion, the spider, 
which he provided every day with gnats 
and flies. The spider, soon perceiving that 
he used her as a friend, grew so tame, that, 
whenever he touched her web, she should 
come out and receive from his hand the 
fly that he held to her. 

The lama also and its young ones soon 
grew fond of his society. As often as ha 
returned home, they came jumping to meet 

him > 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. £09 

him; they would smell about him to find 
whether he had brought them any thing, 
and gratefully lick his hand whenever he 
gave them fresh grass or young branches 
to eat. 

After this he weaned the young ones, 
and then began to milk the clam regularly 
morning: and evening:. His cocoa-nut shells 
served him for pails and milk pans, and this 
milk, which he used partly sweet and partly 
curdled, contributed not a little, by its 
agreeable taste and nourishing quality, to 
lender his solitary life still more tolerable. 

As his cocoa-nut tree was useful to him 
in so many respects, he was extremely de- 
sirous to find a method of producing more 
of them. But how wars he to contrive it? 
lie had often heard of grafting trees, but 
the manner in which it was done had never 
excited his curiosity. " Oh," said he to 
himself, " how little is the advantage that I 
have reaped from the years of my childhood, 
when I had time and opportunity to have 
learnt so much ! Ah! if I had known my 
own interest better, should I not have taken 



'210 THE NEW 

notice of every thing that I saw or heard? 
And if my capacity did not allow me to ar- 
rive at the height of learning which many 
men attain, I should at least have come 
near it ; and how useful would every thing 
that I could have learnt be to me at this 
present moment ! Oh ! if I could grow 
young again, how attentive would I be to 
every thing that is executed by the hands 
or industry of men ! There is not a trade 
nor an art of which I would not have en- 
deavoured to learn some part.' 7 

But of what use were these wishes r The 
misfortune was now past remedy. It was, 
therefore, his business to exert himself in 
supplying by his own invention what he 
wanted in skill ; and this, in effect, was 
the course that he took. 

Without knowing whether he was right 
or wrong, he cut off the tops of two or 
three young trees; in the middle of the 
trunk he made a small slit, in which he 
s t u c k a y o u n g t w i g fro m t h e c o c o a- n u 1 1 r e c ; 
he then covered round with thin bark the 

place 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 211 

place where he had made the slit, and wait- 
ed with impatience for the result of his la- 
bour. This, too, succeeded with him. After 
some time the suckers began to bud, and 
now he had found a method to produce a 
whole grove of cocoa-nut trees. 

Here was a fresh cause for rejoicing, and 
for entertaining the most lively gratitude 
towards our Creator, who has implanted in, 
the nature of things such virtues and 
qualities, that living creatures are no where 
in want of means to preserve themselves, 
and render their condition agreeable. 

Both the old lama and the young were 
in a short time grown as tame as dogs. He 
began, therefore, by little and little, as oc- 
casion required, to make them serve for 
carrying burthens, especially whenever he 
went out for any thing that would have 
been too much trouble for himself to carry. 

Rich. Ay ; but how could he take them 
with him when there was no way for them 
to go out of the enclosure ? 

Mr. Bill. I forgot to tell you, that, in the 

new 



112 THE NEW 

new wall, at a part where it touched a close 
thicket, he had left an opening where a 
lama could barely squeeze itself out. This 
hole was not to be seen from without, and 
every evening Robinson closed it up with 
branches strongly interwoven together. 

It was delightful to see Robinson coming 
home to his habitation, and his lama walk- 
ing before him. She was soon able to find 
the way as well as her master, and when she 
came to the little door she stopped first to 
be unloaded, and then crept in upon her 
belly, Robinson following by the same pas- 
sage. Then was the joy of the young la- 
mas complete; they expressed their satis- 
faction by jumping and bleating, and would 
run first to their mother to welcome her 
home, then to their master to caress him 
also. Robinson, on such occasions, would 
mix his joy with theirs, as a father rejoices 
over his children when he clasps them in 
his arms once more after an absence of 
some time. 

Mr. Rose It must be confessed, there is 

some- 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 213 

something very instructive and affecting 
in this gratitude of animals towards a man 
who has done them a kindness. 

Mr. Bill. There are several examples of 
it which are extremely striking, and would 
almost induce us to believe that some 
beasts are really endued with thought like 
men, if we had not, on the other hand, 
proofs of the contrary. 

Henry. Ay^ for instance, the lion and 
the man mentioned in Sandford and 
Mertgn — what was the man's name? 

Rich. And nodes. 

Henry. The same. He had plucked a 
thorn out of the lion's paw. 

Geo. There was a good lion ! He was so 
fond of Androcles, who had done him that 
service ; and ever after, in return, he did 
the man no harm when he had it in his 
power to devour him. If they were all like 
him, I should like to have a lion myself. 

Rich. For my part, I like much better 
the dog- that belonged to a Swiss. 



Harriet. What dog? 



Rich. 



214 THE NEW 

Rich. Have you forgot him ? The dog 
that saved the lives of two men. 

Harriet. Dear Richard, tell us that story. 

Rich. There was once a man in Switzer- 
land, where those high mountains the Alps 
are. Well, the man climbed up to the top 
of one of them, which was prodigious high. 
Oh, it was as high, as high — as if you were 
to put St. Paul's upon itself ten times oyer. 

Geo. You leave out one thing, brother; 
he took a guide with him. 

Rich* Certainly, he took a guide — 
well, and the guide took his dog. Now, 
when they had reached the top of the 
mountain 

Geo. Yes, and the mountain was co- 
vered with snow 

Rich. Pray hold your tongue — Well, 
.then, the mountain was all- covered with 
snow. Now, when they were almost at 
the top, the gentleman slipped, and the 
guide going to his assistance slipped too, 
and so then they both slipped and slid 
until they were within a few yards of the 

edge 



ROBINSON- CRUSOE. 215 

edge of the precipice from which they 
would have fallen down almost a mile be- 
fore they touched the bottom. But then the 
good dog seized his master by the skirt of 
his co it, and held him fast, so that he could 
not slip any farther, and he held the gen- * 
tleman until they both got up, 

Geo. Well, now you must tell us what 
the gentleman said ; I have not forgot it; 

Rich. Nor I neither, He invited the 
guide to come and see him as often as he 
pleased at his house, and charged him never 
upon any account to forget bringing his 
dog, as lie intended, whenever he came, 
to give him a good belly-full. 

Harriet. And did the gentleman do so? 

Rich. Yes, certainly: as often as the 
guide visited him, he entertained him in 
the best manner he could, and was always 
sure to give the dog a full belly. 

Harriet. That was well done. 

Mr. Bill. Well, my dear children, we 
have lost sight of Robinson. Shall we 
stop here for this evening? 

Geo. 



216 THE NEW 

Geo. Oh, dear papa, no. A little more 
of Robinson, let it be ever so little. 

Mr. Bill. By this time his bricks were 
hard enough to be used. He looked, 
therefore, for some chalky earth, with 
which, instead of lime, he intended to 
make mortar for his wall ; and he found 
some. In the next place, he made him- 
self a trowel of a flat stone, and, being re- 
solved to have every thing complete that 
belongs to a bricklayer, he went even so 
far as to make a square and a plummet, 
but not in a bungling manner; as perfect 
as possible. You know, I suppose, what 
those things are ? 

Edzv. Oh, as to that matter, we have 
seen them pretty often. 

Mr. Bill. Having, therefore, finished 
all the preparatives requisite for his ma- 
sonry, he made his lama bring home the 
bricks that he had occasion for. 

Rich. But how was he able to put the 
bricks upon the lama? 

Mr. Bill. Why, indeed, you would not 

easilv 



ROBTNSON CRUSOE. 217 

-easily guess how he contrived it, therefore 
I think it best to tell you at once. 

He had long observed that it would be 
a very great advantage to him to know 
something of the useful art of weaving 
wicker panniers ; but he had taken so little 
notice in his youth of the manner in which 
basket-makers work, that he knew as much 
of this art, which, nevertheless, is tolerably 
easy, as he did of all the other useful arts^ 
that is to say, he knew nothing about it. 

However, as he had once succeeded in 
making an umbrella by this sort of weav- 
ing, he frequently afterwards amused him- 
self in his leisure hours with trials of the 
same kind, by dint of which he discovered 
at length the whole mystery of the art, so 
as to be able to make a pretty tight pan- 
nier. Two of these he had woven on pur- 
pose for his lama to carry. He fastened 
them together 'with a string, and laid them 
upon the lama in such a manner that they 
hung down one on each side, 
Vol. I. K Geo> 



218 THE NEW 

Geo. Oh, papa! I should like to learn 
basket-making. 

Mr. Bill. Well, then, I will speak to a 
basket-maker, the first time I meet one, 
to come here and give you some lessons. 

Geo. Oh, that will be charming ! And 
then I will make a beautiful little work 
basket for Harriet. 

Harriet. And I will learn to make 
them too, papa, shan't I ? 

Mr. Bill. By all means ; it can do you 
no harm. In effect, we sometimes have 
an idle hour upon our hands, when this 
basket-making would come in quite sea- 
son ablv. 

Robinson then fell to his bricklaying, in 
which he succeeded tolerably well. He 
had now built up one of the side walls of 
his kitchen, and laid the foundation of the 
other, when all of a sudden there happened 
something which he had never dreamt of, 
and which terribly disappointed all his 

plans. 

Rich. 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 219 

Rich* I wonder what that accident 
was. 

Harriet. Oh ! I know it. The savages 
came and ate him up. 

Geo. Mercy on us? was it that, papa? 

Mr. Bill. No, it was not that. But it; 
was something that frightened him almost 
as much as if the savages were come to 
roast him alive. 

Rich. Dear me ! what was it ? 

Mr. Bill. It was night, and Robinson 
on his bed of hay slept soundly, with his 
lamas at his feet. The moon shone out in 
all its splendor, the air was clear and calm, 
and a profound silence reigned over all na- 
ture. Rcbiii3on, fatigued with the toils of 
the day, was fallen into a sweet slumber, 
and dreaming, as usual, of his dear parents, 

when suddenly but let us not close this 

evening's entertainment with an event so 
full of terror ; we might, perhaps, dream 
of it, and have our sleep disturbed. Rather 
let us turn our thoughts to something more

NINTH EVENING. 



MR. BILLINGSLEY having brought 
the history of the New Robinson Crusoe 
down to the end of the preceding evening 
it nowhappened that business indispensably 
called him away for several evenings suc- 
cessively, and prevented him from resum- 
ing the story, much to the disappointment 
of his young famity. 

They were quite impatient to know what 
this was that had happened to poor Robin- 
$or, and they would any of them have given 
their favourite plaything to be informed of 
the events of that dreadful night, concern- 
ing which Mr. Billingsley had so long kept 

silence. 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 2&V 

silence. Unfortunately, it was not in the 
power of any other person but their father 
to inform them, and he thought proper to 
say nothing of it until he should have time 
to continue the story regularly as usuaL 

Their conjectures were endless, and only 
served topuzzle them more and more* One 
guessed this thing, another that; but none 
of their guesses, agreed entirely with the 
circumstances which they already knew of 
this mysterious adventure* 

"But why should we not know the whole?" 
said some of them in a very piteous tone.: 

" I have my reasons," answered their; 
father. 

The children were, by a prudent educa- 
tion, accustomed to be satisfied with this 
answer, and therefore pressed no farther,- 
but waited with a guarded impatience fer- 
tile moment when the cause of their father's - 
silence should no longer exist. Mean time,' 
as it is easy for a grown-up person to read: 
•the thoughts of children, Mr. Billingsley 
could clearly perceive what passed in their 
K 3 minds. 



222 THE NEW 

minds. The following reflection was writ- 
ten, as it were, upon the forehead of each 
of them: "Why does our papa refuse us 
this satisfaction? What' reasons can he 
have for not gratifying our curiosity !" He 
thought proper, therefore, upon this occa- 
sion, to convince them once more that he 
did not want the inclination to make them 
as happy as lay in his power, and to shew 
ihem that he had reasons of importance 
for not continuing the story. 

u Prepare yourselves," said he, " to set 
off to-morrow morning very early on a 
party down the river for Greenwich. You 
have often wished to see it, and to-morrow 
I propose to indulge you." 

" Down the river ? — to Greenwich ? — in 
a hoat?— What I, papa? — Shall I go ?-— 
And I i v asked all the children with one 
voice, and a general "IV having satis- 
fied all their questions, they ran, quite 
transported with joy, to communicate the 
news to their mamma, and to make the 
necessary preparations for their voyage. 

"To

"To Greenwich ! to Greenwich! Where 
are my half-boots? Jenny, where are my 
gloves PQuick ! the brush! the comb! We are 
going to Greenwich! Quick! quick!"' No- 
thing was to be heard all over thehouse, but 
these expressions of joy and impatience. 

Every thing, therefore, was prepared for 
the next day's party; and the young tra- 
vellers, in the fulness of their joy, asked a 
thousand questions, without waiting for a 
single answer. They were, at length,, 
however, prevailed on to go to bed for that 
night, their impatience being so great,, 
that they were already wishing for the 
morning to set out on their journey. 

At length the morning appeared, and 
the whole house was in motion. Nothing 
was heard but knocking at each other's 
bed rooms; so that they were all very 
soon obliged to rise and dress themselves. 

When the whole party, old and young, 
were assembled, and the former were al- 
most devoured with caresses by the latter; 
Mi\ Billings ley rubbed his eyes, and in a 
K 4 tone

tone of voice which breathed most sorrow- 
ful discord to the accents of universal joy, 
he said, M My dear children, if you would 
do me a favour, you would excuse me to 
day from performing my promise." 

" What promise? what promise?"- — and 
each mouth that asked this question re~ 
mained open in anxious expectation, ac- 
companied with a sort cf fright 

Mr, Bill, The promise that 1 made -to 
you of going to Greenwich to day. 

The astonishment and confusion of the 
younger part of the company was com- 
plete. Not one could utter a syllable. 

Mr. Bill I have been thinking last night 
that we should do wrong to go on this 
party to-day 

The Children, Why so, papa?— — and 
they could hardly speak for sobs. 

Air. Bill. I will tell you, and then leave 
it to yourselves to judge. In the first place, 
we have had, for some time past, an easterly 
wind, (and, I find, it is in the same point this 
morning,) which makes the river extremely 

rough* 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 225 

rough, and must be very disagreeable to a 
party that are going down. 

■The Children. But, papa, the wind may 
change still. 

Mr. Bill. Besides, I considered, that, if 
we were to stop another month, we should 
see many of the East India ships, that are 
to sail this year, dropping down to Dept- 
ford; and I know two or three captains of 
them; we might, perhaps, dine aboard of 
one,, which would be very agreeable—would 
it not? 

The Children. Yes, papa — but — — 
Mr. Bill., But I have still a stronger rea- 
son. You know, Charles and Arthur Stan-' 
field, your first cousins, whom you have: 
never seen yet, are to come out of Che- 
shire shortly, and spend a month with us ; 
would it not be infinitely better to wait 
for their coming, and take them with us? 
Would they not, as often as we should 
speak to them of the agreeableness of our 
party, sigh and wish that they had been 
there too? And, in that case, would the, 
K5 remem- 



226 THE SEW 

remembrance of our clay's pleasure cause 
us much satisfaction ! No ; certainly not. 
On the contrary, we should always be 
sorry within ourselves, that we had not 
done by them as we could wish them to do 
with regard to us, were we actually in their 
place and they in ours. Therefore, what 
say you ? 

A profound silence. 

Mr. Billingslei/ goes on. You know, I ne- 
ver broke my word with you ; so that, if 
you insist upon it, we shall set off. But if 
you would, of your own accord, quit me 
of my promise, you would do me a kind- 
ness ; and you would do your cousins a 
kindness, and yourselves. Therefore speak 
— VYhat is to be done ? 

" We will wait" was the answer ; and, 
consequently, the fine party of pleasure 
was put off till another time. 

It was easy to be seen that this victory 
over themselves had cost some of them, 
dear: these were far from being as chear- 
ful as usual the rest of the day. Mr. BiU 

lingsley 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 227 

lingsley took occasion, therefore, towards 
evening, when they were ail assembled, to 
speak to them in this manner: 

u My dear children, what has happened 
to you to-day, will happen toyou frequently 
in the course of your lives. You will ex- 
pect to enjoy this or that earthly advan- 
tage ; your hopes will appear as well found- 
ed as possible, and you will burn with im- 
patience to realize them ; but in the very 
moment when you think to touch this long- 
expected happiness, Divine Providence, 
which is supremely wise, will, in an instant,, 
disappoint your designs, when you shall- 
least' expect it, and thus you will find your 
too sanguine hopes many, many a time 
sadly frustrated. 

"The reasons which your heavenly Father 
will have to act thus with you, will seldom 
appear to you so clearly and distinctly as- 
you have heard my reasons this morning; 
for putting off our party to Greenwich : for 
God; being infinitely wise, looks to the most 
remote futurity;. and often, forouradvan- 
K 6 tage, 



£28 THE NEW 

tage, suffers things to happen, the good 
effects of which we do not experience until 
long after, perhaps, even in another world. 
"Now, if every thing were tohappen per- 
fectly to your wish while you are young, 
and if you always obtained, at the exact mo- 
ment, whatever was the object of your hopes, 
oh ! my dears, how much the worse would 
it be for you during the remainder of your 
lives ! How would your hearts be corrupted 
by such prosperity ; and how unhappy 
would your affections, thus corrupted, 
make you at'a time when things should not 
go quite to your liking ! And such a time 
will come, my dears; it will come as cer- 
tainly for you as it comes for all other men; 
for hitherto there has never been a man in 
the world, who could say that things have 
always succeeded with him completely, and 
according to the fulness of his wishes. 

"In this case, then, what are we to do, my 
dear children r— No more than this ; ac- 
custom yourselves, while you are young, ta 
deprive yourselves frequently of a pleasure 

which 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. £29 

which you would have given the world to 
enjoy. This victory over yourselves, often 
repeated, will strengthen your understand- 
ings and your affections in such sort, that, 
for the future, you will be able to support, 
with unshaken fortitude, whatever a wise 
and benevolent God shall appoint you for 
your good. 

" What I have said will teach you, my 
dear children, to interpret many instances 
of our behaviour, which to you appear un 
accountable, and which we, who are ad- 
vanced in years, commonly adopt with re- 
gard to you. You have, no doubt, often 
been surprised at our refusing you a gra- 
tification for which, perhaps, you long 
ardently. Sometimes we have told you the: 
reasons of our refusal ; that is, when you 
were capable of understanding them : and 
sometimes, on the other hand, we have not 
told you them; for instance, when you 
were too young to be able to understand 
them. And why did we do so ? Oftea 
merely on purpose to exercise your pa- 
tience 



230 THE NEW 

tience and moderation, virtues so necessary 
to all men, and to prepare you for the sub- 
sequent accidents of your lives. 

" You know now, also, wky, for these 
few days past, I have forborne the recital 
of Robinson Crusoe's Historv. I miarht 
certainly have found, at least, sufficient 
time to clear up to you the adventure with 
which I lefe oft) and concerning which you 
have been, ever since, in a disagreeable un- 
certainty : but, you see, I did not tell you 
another word about it, though you fre- 
quently asked me, and it is always against 
my will that I refuse you> any thing. Now, 
why did I do thus, Harriet?" 

Harrkt. Because, papa, you had a mied 
to teach us patience. 

Mr. Bill. Very right! And most cer- 
tainly, if ever you have cause to thank m$ 
for any thing, it will fo<e for accustoming 
you thus to give up without regret any 
thing of which you have before ardently, 
desired the possession. 

A few days more passed without any talk 

of 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 331 

of going on with the story of Robinson Cru- 
soe ; but, at length, the hour so earnestly 
long for arrived, when Mr. Billingsley 
was no longer prevented by business, or 
otherwise from satisfying the general wish. 
He went on, therefore, without interrupt 
tion, in these words : 

It was night, as I told you at my leaving 
off, and Robinson was quietly stretched 
on his bed of dry grass, witli his faithful 
lamas at his feet. A deep calm overspread 
all the face of nature, and Robinson, ac- 
cording to his custom, was dreaming of his 
parents, when, all at once, the earth shook, 
in an uncommon manner, and a rumbling 
noise was heard, together with dreadful 
cracks, as if many storms burst forth all 
at once. Robinson started up in a fright, 
and jumped out of bed without knowing 
what was the matter, nor where he was go* 
ing. At this moment happened a dreadful 
shock of the earth, which was succeeded' 
by several others equally violent. The rumb- 
ling noise also continued, which seemed 

to

to came from under ground. At the same 
time arose a furious hurricane, which tore 
up trees, and even rocks, and agitated the 
very depths of the roaring sea. All the 
elements seemed to be at war with each 
other, and nature to approach her final dis- 
solution. 

- Robinson, almost frantic with, terror, ran 
out of his cave into the space before it, and 
the affrighted kmas followed. Scarce were* 
they out, when a piece of the rock, which, 
rested over the cave, fell down upon the 
bed which Robinson had just left, Feai; 
now, lent him wings: he fled with precipi- 
tation through the small opening in his wall 
of trees, and the lamas, no less terrified, 
were close at his heels. 

His first intention was to secure himself 
upon a neighbouring mountain, on the top 
of -which was a plain perfectly open, that he 
might not be in danger of the falling trees. 
He was going torun.thither, when suddenly 
he beheldj.tohis infinite terror and surprise, 
that very same spot of the mountain open 
with a huge gap, and vomit forth smoke ?

ROBINSON CRUSOE*. £55 

lire, cinders, stones, and a burning stream 
of what is called lava. He could scarcely 
tell which way to run from this dreadful 
eruption, as the burning lava rolled down 
the hill like a river, and great fragments 
of rock were hurled into the air, in every 
direction, and fell as thick as hail. 

He ran towards the sea-side ; but here 
he beheld a new scene no less terrible. A 
dreadful whirlwind, which blew from all 
quarters of the sky, had driven together 
a large quantity of clouds, and heaped 
them, as it were, one upon the other. Their 
own weight burst them at length, and the 
consequence was such a deluge of rain, as, 
in a moment, laid the whole country under 
water. 

Robinson saved himself with difficulty 
by climbing up a tree ; but his poor lamas 
were carried off by the violence of the 
flood. Ah! how it went to his heart to 
hear their plaintive bleatings ; and how 
willingly would he, at the risk of his own 
life, have endeavoured to save them, but 

that 



£34 THE NEW • . 

that the rapidity of the torrent had already 
carried them far beyond his reach ! 

The ear tli continued to shake still for a 
few minutes, after which there fell, all at 
once, a dead calm. The winds subsided > 
the opening of the mountain ceased by de- 
grees to vomit fire; the rumbling under 
ground was heard no more ; the sky cleared 
up, and all the waters ran off in less than 
a quarter of an hour. 

Geo. (siglting heavily) Ah ! thank God 
it is all over ! Poor Robinson and the poor 
lamas ! 

Harriet. For my part, I was terribly 
frightened. 

Charlotte. What occasions these earth- 
quakes, papa r 

Rich. Papa has explained that to us 
long ago, but you were not here. 

Mr. Bill. Tell her, Richard. 

Rich. There are a number of great holes, 
under the earth, like caverns, and these 
are filled with air and exhalations. Besides, 
there are within the earth all manner of 

things-. 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 235 

things that easily take fire, as sulphur, 
pitch, nitre, and the like. These begin 
sometimes te heat and take fire, when 
moisture happens to accompany them. 

Geo, Moisture ? Can wetness, then, oc- 
casion any thing to take fire? 

Rich, Certainly. Have you never seen, 
when masons throw cold water upon, burnt 
lime-stones, how they begin immediately to 
boil and smoke as if they were upon the 
fire, and yet there was no fire near them ? 
Well, in the same manner things take fire 
under ground as soon as water penetrates 
to them ; and then, when they burn, the 
air which is in these great caverns expands 
so prodigiously that there is no longer room 
to contain it, so that, striving forcibly to 
find a passage out, it shakes the earth, un- 
til, at length, it makes an opening some- 
where, and through this opening it comes 
forth like a hurricane, drawing with it a 
quantity of burning* and melted matter. 

Mr. Bill. And this matter, which consists 
of stones, minerals, and unctuous bodies, 

all 



$36 THF NKW 

all melted together, is what we call lava.' 
I have somewhere read that a man might 
make a little mountain for himself that 
would vomit fire. If you should like that, 
we will make the experiment some day. 

The Children, Oh, yes, by all means, 
dear papa. 

Rich. And how is that done? 

Mr. Bill. You need onlv dig a hole in 
the ground where it is moist, and put into 
it some sulphur and filings of iron* This 
mixture will heat and take fire of itself 
and then you have a burning mountain in 
miniature. We will make a trial of it the 
first idle day. 

! While Robinson was coming down from 
the tree on which he had saved himself, his 
mind was so depressed with the calamity 
which had just fallen on him, that he never 
once thought of thanking for his fresh de- 
liverance that Being who had before, more 
than once, preserved him when in the most 
imminent danger of perishing. His situa- 
tion was, indeed, now, to the full as mise- 
rable 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 237 

rable as ever it had been. His cave, the 
only place of refuge that he had hitherto 
found, was, in all probability, a heap of 
ruins; his dear and faithful lamas he had 
seen, with his own eyes, carried off by the 
flood, and without doubt they must have 
perished; all his past labours were demo- 
lished, and his plans for the future disap- 
pointed! The mountain, it is true, had 
ceased to throw up fire, but from the gulpfa, 
which was still open on the top of it, there 
issued forth a thick black smoke, and it 
was very possible that this mountain might 
now continue to be always a volcano- In 
that case, how was Robinson to enjoy one 
moment's security? Might he not reason- 
ably dread a fresh earthquake, or a fresh 
eruption, every day? 

These melancholy ideas completely over- 
powered him, He sunk under the weight 
of his miseries, and, instead of turning him- 
self towards God, the only source of true 
consolation, he. thought of nothing but his 

future 



238 • THE NEW 

future misery, which appeared to him infi- 
nite both in weight and duration. 

Exhausted with anguish and discomfort, 
he leaned against the tree, and, from his 
pained breast, he uttered sighs, or rather 
deep groans, of distress. He remained iii 
this position, the picture of despair, until 
the dawn told the approach of day. 

Geo. (to Mr. Meredith.) I see now 
that my papa was right. 

Mr. MerecL In what? 

Geo, I was thinking lately that Robinson 
was altogether reformed, and that Provi- 
dence might safely order things for his de- 
liverance from the island; but in answer 
to that my papa observed, that our heaven- 
ly Father knew every thing best, and that 
it was not for us to judge in such cases. 

Mr. Mered. And now? 

Geo. Why, now I see plainly that he had 
not the confidence in his Maker which he 
ought to have had, and, therefore, that 
God did well in not delivering him yet. 

Edw. 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 239 

Edzv. So I think too. I must own; I 
am far from liking him now so well as I 
■did some time ago, 

Mr. Bill. Your observation, my dear 
children, is perfectly just. It is true, we 
see plainly that Robinson has not that firm, 
unalterable filial confidence in his Maker 
which he naturally ought to have after so 
many proofs of his wisdom and goodness 
as he had experienced; but, before we 
condemn him on this head, let us first put 
ourselves in his place for a moment, and 
ask our own hearts if we should have acted 
better under the same circumstances. What 
think you, Edward? If you had been Ro- 
binson, would you have had more courage 
than he r 

Edzi\ (hesitating.) I can't say. 

Mr. Bill. Recollect the time when you 
had sore eyes, and we put. blisters behind 
your ears. Do you remember how dispir 
rited you were at times? And yet it was 
but a short-lived pain; it lasted hut too 
days. I know, indeed, that you have more 

sense 



240 THE NEW 

sense now, and would bear the pain better; 
but could you also bear with filial submis- 
sion every thing that Robinson was forced 
to undergo? — What think you, my dear? 
Have I not some reason for doubting upon 
that score? 

Your silence is the best answer to mv 
question. As, thank Heaven, you have 
never been in a situation like that of our 
poor friend Robinson, you cannot tell what 
would be your sentiments if you were: 
therefore, all that we can do at present is 
to accustom ourselves, in the slight mis- 
fortunes which we perhapsmust experience, 
to turn our eyes towards Heaven, and be 
ever patient and full of confidence. Our 
hearts will then be more and more strength- 
t ened every day, so as to bear with due re- 
signation even the greatest sufferings, if 
our heavenly Father shall think proper to 
appoint them to us. 

At length the day appeared, and its new- 
born light, while it spread joy over all na- 
ture, found poof Robinson still leaning 

against 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 241 

against the tree, in a situation truly deplo- 
rable. Sleep had never closed his eyelids ; 
one gloomy thought alone absorded his 
whole soul; he had asked himself a thou- 
sand times the sorrowful question, * What 
will become of me?" At length he set him- 
self in motion, and staggering as he walk- 
ed, like a man who is half asleep, he arrived 
after some time, at the ruins of his habi- 
tation. But what joyful emotions .seized 
his breast, when, all at once, as he came up 
towards the willow enclosure — what think 
you ? — his dear lamas, safe and sound, 
* came jumping to meet him! At first he 
could not believe his eyes, but his doubts 
were soon satisfied. The lamas ran up to 
him, licked his hands, and expressed their 
joy at seeing him again by bleating and 
skipping about. 

Robinson's heart, which, until that mo- 
ment,had seemed insensible and frozen, was 
now awakened. He looked at his lamas, 
then up to Heaven ; and tears of joy, gra- 
titude, and repentance for his want of 
.Vol I. L faith 



24^ THE XKW 

faith, bedewed his cheeks. lie now patted 
and caressed his old friends a thousand 
times, and, accompanied by them, went 
to see what was become of his habitation. 

Henry. But how were the lamas saved r 

l\fr. Bill. We may suppose that the flood 
had carried them to some rising ground 
where the waters were not quite so deep, and 
as they ran off afterwards as rapidly as they 
had fallen from the clouds, the lamas were 
very soon able to return to their habitation. 

Robinson then stood in the front of his 
cave, and, to add to his confusion, found 
the damage here also by no means so con- 
siderable as, in the height of his despon- 
dency, he had imagined it. The ceilings 
which consisted of one piece of rock, had, 
it is true, tumbled down, and in its fall 
brought some of the nearest earth along 
with it; yet, after all, it appeared not im- 
possible to clear the cave of these ruins, and 
then his dwelling-place became twice as 
spacious and convenient as it was before. 

To this must be added another circum- 
stance, 



ROBIXSON CRUSOE. 243 

stance, which plainly demonstrated that Di- 
vine Providence had ordered events thus, 
not to punish Robinson,hut rather expressly 
for his preservation: for when he had more 
closely examined the spot where the piece 
of rock had been suspended, he, to his no 
small terror, perceived it to be surrounded 
on every side by a soft earth, and, conse- 
quently, that it could never have been firmly 
placed ; it was, therefore, likely enough to 
fall down by its own weight sooner or later. 
Now this Divine Providence foresaw, and 
perhaps, moreover, foresaw that the piece 
of rock would fall precisely at a time when 
Robinson was in the cave. But, as the all- 
wise and good Creator had appointed to 
this man a longer life, he had, from the 
creation of the world, so formed the earth, 
that exactly at that time, and in that island, 
there should be such an earthquake. Even 
the rumbling noise underground, and the 
roaring of the hurricane, how terrible so- 
ever they had sounded in the ears of Ro- 
binson, were circumstances thatcontribut- 
ed to save him : for, had the earthquake 



£44 THE NEW 

come on without any noise, Robinson, in 
all likelihood, would not have awakened, 
and then the fall of the rock would cer- 
tainly have put an end to his life. 

Thus, my children, Heaven took care 
pf him at a time when he thought himself 
forsaken, and even made these dreadful ac- 
cidents, which Robinson looked upon as 
his greatest misfortune, contribute wholly 
to his preservation. 

Thishappy experience of heavenly mercy 
you will have frequent opportunities of 
gaining, if you wish to remark the ways by 
which Providence Mill conduct you. In all 
the unfortunate situations of life which it 
may be your lot to fall into, you will find 
thc^e two things ever true; namely, 

In the first place, men always represent 
to themselves the evil which happens as 
greater than it really is. 

Secondly, that all our misfortunes are 
sent to us by our merciful Creator for wise 
and good reasons, and that, consequent Ij r , 
in the end, they will ever contribute to 
our real happiness.

TENTH EVENING. 



MR. BILLINGSLEY goes on.— Robin- 
son, who for some time past had used the 
custom of joining prayer with his labour, 
began by throwing himself on his knees 
to thank God for his late deliverance; 
after which he chearfully set about his work, 
which was to clear his cave of the ruins. 
It was but a slight task to remove the 
earth and the gravel, but there remained 
still the great piece of rock, which had been 
under all. It is true, it was broken in two ; 
but even in this state it seemed to require 
more than the strength of one man to dis- 
lodge it. 

He tried to roll out the smallest of the 
two pieces, but in vain : the task was too 
much for his strength. An attempt so far 
from succeeding discouraged him once 
more. He did not know what to try next. 
L 3 Riclu 



246' THE NEW 

Rich. Oh, I know what I should have 
done. 

Mr. Bill. What? 

Rich. I would have made a lever, or a 
crow, such as the men had the other day 
when they rolled a great beam into the 
barn yard. 

Geo. I was not by then. What is a 
lever, or a crow, as you call it ? 

Rick. It is a long stout pole ; one end 
they put under the beam or the stone that 
they wish to move, and then they place a 
little block or stone under the lever, but as 
close as possible to the beam or whatever 
else is to be rolled along ; then laying their 
hands on the other end of the lever, which 
they press with all their force upon the 
block, the beam is thus raised up, and may 
be rolled without much trouble. 

Mr. Bill. I will explain to you the rea- 
son of that another time : at present listen 
* ?:d hear what Robinson did. 

After having meditated upon the matter 
a long time to no purpose, the idea of the 

lever 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 247 

lever struck him too at last; He recol- 
lected that when he was younghehad some- 
times seen workmen make use of this in- 
strument when they wanted to move very 
heavy loads* and he hastened to make a 
trial of it. 

This succeeded. In half an hour he 
rolled the two pieces of stone clean out 
of the cave, which four men with their 
hands alone could not have stirred from 
their places ; and then he had the satisfac- 
tion of seeing his dwelling twice as spacious 
as before, and, what was of infinitely more 
consequence, quite secure as far as the eye 
could examine : for now both the walls 
and the ceiling consisted of one hollow 
rock, in which there could no where be 
discovered the smallest crack. 

Edwl But,, papa, what was become of 
his spider? 

Mr. Bill. I am glad you put me in mind 

of it. Poor spider ! I had almost forgot it. 

But, in truth, I can tell you nothing about 

it, unless that, according to all appearancej 

L 4 it 



£48 tE N£W 

it was buried under the ruins of the ceiling; 
at least, Robinson never saw it again; how- 
ever, his other friends, the lamas, made 
him amends for its loss. 

He now ventured to turn his steps to- 
wards the volcano, from which a black 
smoke still continued to rise He was 
astonished at the quantity of melted mat- 
ter that had run from it on all sides ; part 
of which was not cold yet. For this time, 
therefore, he only admired, at a distance, 
the grand, but dreadful sight of the smok- 
ing gulf, because fear, and the lava, which 
was still too hot, hindered him from ap* 
proachiug nearer. 

Having remarked that the principal 
stream of lava had taken its course towards 
the spot where his potatoes grew, he was 
much terrified at the idea that this torrent 
of fire might, perhaps, have laid waste the 
whole place ; nor could he be easy until he 
satisfied himself on this head. He went, 
therefore, to the spot, and found, to his 
great joy, the whole plantation safe and 
sound. 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. £-19 

From that moment, he resolved, at all 
hazards, to plant potatoes in many different 
parts-of his island, in order to prevent the 
misfortune of seeing himself deprived of 
so admirable a fruit by some unlucky ac- 
cident or other. It is true, winter, accord- 
ing to his reckoning, was now just at hand; 
" but," said he to himself, " who knows 
whether these plants are not of the sort 
that will stand the winter?" 

Having put this design into execution, 
he began again to work upon his kitchen. 
Here also the terrible convulsion of nature 
which had just happened, was the means 
of procuring him a great advantage; for* 
you must know, that the burning moun- 
tain had, amongst other things, thrown up 
a considerable quantity of limestones. 
These are commonly burnt in a kiln before 
lime can be made of them; but here that 
was not necessary, for the burning moun- 
tain had already been as good as a lime- 
kiln to them. 

Robinson, therefore, had only to gather 
1-5 a small 



250 THE NEW 

a small heap of these stones, to throw water 
upon them, and then to stir the heap well 
about. Thus the lime was slaked, and 
made proper for the mason's use. He then 
mixed with it a little sand, fell to work 
immediately, and had reason to be pleased 
with his own cleverness. 

In the mean time, the mountain had 
ceased smoking, and Robinson ventured to 
approach the gulf. He found the sides 
and the bottom covered with cold lava; 
and as he could not perceive the least smoke 
come out any where, he had reason to hope 
that the subterraneous fire was entirely 
extinguished, and that, for the future, he 
should have no eruptions to dread. 

This hope having given him fresh 
strength and spirits, he turned histhoughts 
towards laying in a store of provisions 
against the winter. With this intent he 
caught, one after another, eight lamas, in 
the same manner as he had caught the first. 
All these he killed, except one ram, which 
he kept alive to be company for his three 

tame 



ROBINSON CttUSOE. £5 1 

tame lamas; and he hung up the greatest 
part of the flesh in his kitchen to smoke. 
But first he had let it lie some days in salt, 
because he had remembered to have seen 
his mother do so at home, when she made 
bacon. 

Here was a pretty good stock of provi- 
sions ; jet still he dreaded lest he should 
fall short if the winter was severe and tasted 
long. For this reason, he would have ta- 
ken more lamas, but he found his method 
would no longer answer; for the creatures 
had, at length, taken notice of his manner 
of noosing them, and were, therefore, on 
their guard ; so that he was obliged to in- 
vent some new way of taking them. 

This way he soon found: so inexhaustible 
are the resources of the human, mind, if 
properly exerted, in providing for its wants, 
and encreasing its happiness. He had ob- 
served that the lamas, whenever they per- 
ceived him near the spring, ran swiftly to- 
wards a neighbouring coppice, in their way 
to which they passed over a little hill. The ' 
L 6 farther 



( 25 l 2 THE NEW 

farther side of this hill was hedged, as it 
were, with small thickets; and close be- 
hind this hedge there was a descent as steep 
as a wall, and about a couple of yards deep, 
The lamas, in their flight, always jumped 
clean over the hedge, and landed at the 
bottom of the hill; and this observation 
determined him to dig a deep hole on'this 
spot, where the lamas jumped down, that 
they might fall into it and be taken. His 
indefatigable labour finished in a day and 
a half this new work of his invention. The 
pit he covered over with green branches, 
and the next day had the satisfaction of see- 
ing two tolerable large lamas taken in it. 
He now thought himself sufficiently pro- 
vided with meat. He would have been 
puzzled where to lay it all up during the 
winter, if the earthquake had not furnished 
him with a cellar in every respect complete: 
for close by his cave another piece of the 
hillock had sunk about two fathom in depth, 
and thereby formed a second cavern, open- 
ins:, as well as the first, into his enclosure. 
He had now his dwelling apartment, kit- 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 2.5$ 

chen, and cellar, all adjoining each other, 
and placed as conveniently as if they bad 
been planned and laid out by art. 

There now remained three things more r 
which done, he was to count himself fully 
guarded and provided against the expected 
approach of winter: hay was to be made 
for his lamas; a stock of wood to be laid 
up for firing ; and all his potatoes were to 
be dug up, and lodged in the cellar. 

Hay he had collected in a pretty large 
quantity, and stacked it up in his court- 
yard, as haymakers do here ; and whenever 
he put fresh hay on it, he trod it down so 
hard that the rain could not easily soak 
into.it. But here experience taught him 
a little more of haymaking, though at the 
expence of some labour and trouble. 

You must know, he had not taken care 
to dry the hay perfectly. Whenever this 
happens, and it is at the same time pressed 
down tightly in the stack, it begins to heat, 
next to smoke, and at length it takes fire. 
This was a matter that Robinson had never 

heard 



254- THE NEW 

heard of when lie was young; for lie had 
never much troubled his head about farm- 
ing business; but in his present situation 
he learned how useful it is to remark even- 
thing, and to collect as much information 
as possible, even though we cannot foresee 
how far it may, one day or other, become 
useful. 

His surprise was great, indeed, when he 
saw, all of a sudden, his haycock begin to 
smoke; but he was still much more asto- 
nished, when, on thrusting his hand into it, 
lie found the inside burning hot. He could 
not persuade himself but that the hay was 
on fire, though he could not possibly con- 
ceive how "the fire could get in there. 

He took down the haycock, therefore, as 
fast as possible ; but was very much sur- 
prised to find no fire, and to see that the 
hay was every where extremely hot and 
moist. He was, therefore, at last, con- 
vinced, (as was really the case) that the 
moisture alone caused the hay to heat, 
though he could, in no wise, conceive how 
that should be. 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. c 255 

Rich. I must own I find it hard to ima- 
gine how wetness alone can make any 
thing heat. 

Mr. Bill. My dear Richard, there are a 
thousand such effects as this in nature ; and 
human reason, which hath been reflecting 
on them for many ages, hath clearly dis- 
covered the true causes of many of them. 
These useful discoveries are comprised in 
a science, of which, perhaps, you do not 
know the name. It is called Natural Phi- 
losophy. There you may find the reason 
of this remarkable effect of moisture, as 
well as many other appearances in nature 
that are extremely singular. And if you 
continue to apply yourself properly to the 
sciences which you are learning at present, 
I will teach you also that of natural philo- 
sophy, which will give you inexpressible 
pleasure. Here it would be to no purpose 
to introduce it, because you could not 
understand what I should say to you, 

Robinson then dried his hay afresh, and 
made it up into a fresh haycock, which 
could stand secure against both wind and 



156 THE NEW 

rain. To render it still more secure, he 
topped it with a covering of reeds, scarce 
inferior in firmness to our thatch roofs. 

For some days following, lie employed 
himself in gathering as much dry wood as 
he judged he should want. After this, he 
dug up, his potatoes, and found them a 
very considerable stock. These he laid 
up carefully in his cellar. Lastly, he shook 
the lemon-tree, and brought home as many 
of the fruit as were ripe, to preserve them 
too against the winter; and now he was 
freed from all apprehensions of want du- 
ring the bad weather. 

But though it was almost the end of 
October, the cold, which had made Ro- 
binson so uneasy, was not to be felt in the 
least. Instead of that, the weather turned 
to rain, and it rained so incessantly that 
the air seemed to be changed into water. 
He did not know what to think of it. For 
a fortnight together, he never put his foot 
outside of his cave, unless to go to the cel- 
lar, the haystack, or the spring, to fetch 

victuals 



ROBINSON' CRUSOE. Z!>7 

victuals and water for himself and his la- 
mas. The rest of the time he was obliged 
to pass like a prisoner. 

How heavily the hoars crept on! No- 
thing to do, and all alone! My dear chil- 
dren, it is impossible for you to imagine a 
greater misery! If any body could have 
given him a book, or pen, ink, and paper, 
lie would, with great chearfulness, have 
given one day of his life for every sheet 
of paper. * l Oh !" said he now and then to 
himself, with a heavy sigh, " how silly was 
I in my younger days to look upon read- 
ing and writing as something tiresome, and 
idleness as something agreeable ! The most 
tedious book in the world would now be a 
treasure to me, and I would prefer a sheet 
of paper, with pen and ink, to the posses- 
sion of a kingdom." 

During this wearisome time, necessity 
forced him to have recourse to all sorts of 
employments which he had not hitherto 
tried. He had been meditating a long tin.c 
whether it would not be possible for him to 

make 



'25$ THE NEM' 

make an earthen pot and a lamp; thing.3 
which would have rendered his situation in- 
comparably better. He ran, therefore, in 
the middle of the rain, to look for potter's 
earth; and, havingfound a sufficient quan- 
tity of it, he immediately began to work. 

The making of earthen vessels did not 
succeed with him all at once: he made 
many ineffectual trials at first ; but, hav- 
ing nothing else to do, as often as his work 
was finished, and not to his liking, he 
amused himself with breaking it to pieces, 
and beginning afresh. lie spent a few 
days in. this manner, his work affording 
him amusement rather than trouble, until 
at length his pot and lamp were finished so 
complete, that it would have been ill-nature 
to break them again. He placed' them, 
.therefore, in his kitchen, not far from the 
fire, to dry gradually. After this, he went 
on making other pots, pans, and pipkins; 
of different shapes and sizes; and the more 
lie practised this work, the more ready he 
became at it. 

The rain continued, in the mean time, 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. £59 

v, i'cbout interruption. Robinson, therefore, 
saw himself under the necessity of invent- 
ing other domestic labours to keep himself 
from the unpleasant effects of having no- 
thing to do. His first task was to make a 
foiling net. He had laid in, beforehand, 
a pretty good stock of packthread, which 
came now very seasonably into use. As he 
took time enough, and had the patience to 
try a thing ten times or more, which did 
not succeed with him at first, he found, 
at length, the true method of making the 
knots, and he became as clever at the work 
as any woman or girl in this country who 
practises making nets or purses: for he 
had invented also an instrument of wood, 
which he cut with his knife of flint, some- 
thing in the form of a spit; and with this 
he contrived to make a net, which, for 
goodness and real use, was little inferior 
to our common fishing nets. 

It next came into his head to try whether 
he could not make a bow and arrows. The 
thought of this set him all alive, when he 
considered the manv great ad v>anrt aires that 



'26o the mir 

a bow would procure him! With a bow 
and arrows he could kill lamas, he could 
shoot birds, and — what was by far rnorc 
important — with these he could defend 
himself in his dwelling place, if ever the 
savages came to attack him. He was all 
impatience to see the bow finished, and 
ran, notwithstanding the rain and the wind, 
to look for the proper wood. 

For it was not every sort of wood that 
was fit for the purpose; it should beat 
the same time hard and supple, that on the 
one hand it might be hent without much 
difficulty, and on the other, when bent* 
might endeavour to return to. its former 
state. 

Rich. It should be elastic, papa ; should 
it not? 

Mr. Bill. The very thing. I did not 
know that you remembered the significa- 
tion of that word, and therefore I did not 
chuse tomake use of it. 
H aving, therefore, found and cut a piece 
of this sort of wood, he carried it home, and 
began immediately to work upon it. Bat, 



HOEINSON CRUSOE. %6l 

alasl how did he then feel the want of a 
proper knife! He was obliged to cut twen- 
ty -times to bring off as much wood as we 
could cut at once with a knife of steel. 
Though he worked from the rising to the 
setting of the sun at this task without the 
least intermission, he was obliged to be eight 
whole days about it. I know some people 
who would not have had such patience. 

Geo. (to the other children) Papa means 
us now. 

Mr. Bill. George, you have just guessed 
it; and do not you think that I am right ? 

Geo. Why, yes, papa. But, for the fu- 
ture, I will take care to go on with what- 
ever work I once begin. 

Mr. Bill. You will do well. Robinson, 
at least, found the advantages of doing so. 
He had the inexpressible joy of seeing his 
bow finished on the ninth day; and now he 
wanted nothing but a string and arrows. 
If he had thought of it when he killed the 
lamas, he would have tried, perhaps, to 
make strings of their guts; for he knew 

that 



2&2 THE XEW 

that in Europe, it is common to make them 
out of sheeps guts. For want, therefore, 
of catgut he twisted a string of packthread, 
and made it as strong as possible. After 
thio he proceeded to make his arrows. 

What would lie have given for a small 
piece of iron to point his arrows with ! But 
wishing was to no purpose. As he stood at 
the door of his cave, considering how he 
might supply the want of iron points to his 
arrows, he turned his eyes, by chance, on 
the lump of gold which lay there still on the 
ground as a thing of no use. " Go," said 
he, spurning' it with his foot, "go, useless 
metal, and become iron, if you wish that I 
should value you ! " And, with these words, 
he turned away from it, not deigning to 
look a& it again. 

By dint of thinking on the subject over 
and over again, he, at length, remembered 
to have heard that the savages of some na* 
tionsmake use offish bones and sharp stones 
to point their lances and arrows ; and he re- 
solved to imitate them in this respect : at 

the 



HO VINSON CRUSOE. Sb3 

the same time he formed the design of 
making* a latice or spear. 

These two things were immediately put 
into execution. He ran to the sea-side, 
and was lucky enough to find some fish- 
bones and sharp, flints, exactly such as he 
wanted. After this, lie cut a long, straight 
staff for the spear, and returned home wet 
to the very skin. 

In a few days the spear and the arrows 
were finished. He had pointed the spear 
with a sharp stone, and the arrows with 
strong fish-bones ; to the other end of his 
arrows hetiedfeathers, to make them fly 
the better. 

He then tried how his'bow would shoot; 
though it wanted anumberof things, which 
he could not possibly add to it for want of 
iron tools, he found it, however, tolerably 
handy for shooting birds, or other small 
animals. He did not even doubt but he 
should be able, with this bow, to wound a 
naked savage dangerously, provided the 
savage would let him come near enough. 

He 



264 1 HE NEW 

He had still better reason to be pleased 
with bis spear. 

His earthen pots and his lamp seemed 
now to be sufficiently dry. He resolved, 
therefore to make use of them. In the 
first place, lie put. into one of his new pip- 
kins a lump of fat, which he had taken out 
of the lamas that he killed. This fat he in- 
tended to melt, and use as oil for his lamp. 
But he had the mortification to perceive 
that the fat, as soon as melted, soaked 
through the pipkin, .and filtered .out, drop 
by drop, so that very little remained in the 
pipkin. He concluded from thence, that 
the lamp and pots would have the same de- 
fect, and consequently never be of any use 
to him ; a conjecture which experience 
very soon verified. 

What a disagreeable accident ! He had 
made himself so happy in thinking that he 
should soon spend the evenings pleasantly 
by the light of a lamp, and be able, once 
more, to taste a dish of broth; but now all 
these fine hopes seemed to vanish in a mo- 
ment. 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 26# 

Henry. It was certainly a great vexation 
to see so much trouble lost. 

Mr. Bill. Without doubt it was so; and 
some people, that I know, would have been, 
provoked to fling all the work away, and 
never meddle with pot-making again. But 
Robinson was, by this time, pretty well, 
practised in patience, and had taken it 
strongly in his head that a thing should 
never be done by halves, while it was pos- 
sible to finish it completely. 

He sat down, therefore, in his studying 
corner (for so he called one of the corners of 
his cave, where he used to sit down when 
he had a mind to exercise his invention), 
and there he rubbed hisforehead. " Whence 
comes it, "said he to himself, "that thepots 
in Europe, which are made of earth as well 
as mine, are, nevertheless, much more com- 
pact and do not soak through ? — Why 
that is because they are glazed — Hum! 
Glazed ? Now, what may that be properly 
and how is it done ? — Aha ! I think I 
know now! Yes, it must be so ! Have not 

Vol. I. M I read 



266 THE NEW 

I read somewhere, that sand and sevctal 
other substances, such as earthen vessels, 
are of the nature of glass, and might be 
turned into real glass by a strong fire ? It 
must certainly be so that they manage it: 
they put the earthen ware into a hot fur- 
nace, and when it begins to melt, they 
take it out lest it should be entirely chang- 
edinto glass. Yes, yes, that is the whole 
art. I must do in the same manner." 

No sooner said than done: he kindled a 
good fire in his kitchen, and when it was in 
full blaze, he put one of his pipkins into the 
very middle of it. However, it was not 
long there before — crack it went, and split 

in pieces. " Heyday !" said Robinson, 

" who would have thought it?" 

He sat down again in his studying cor- 
ner. " What could have been tlfe reason 
of this?" said he to himself. — " Have 1 
ever met with any thing similar to this be- 
fore r — Eh ! certainly I have. In winter- 
time, when we have put.a tumbler full of cold 
water or beer on a warm stove, did not the

glass break immediately?— Has it ever hap- 
pened that the glass did not break? Yes, 
when it was put on the stove before it was 
quite hot, or when we put a piece of paper 
under it. Very well: I am pretty sure of 
one thing: ay, ay, that must be the case. 
I must take care not to put it upon the fire 
all at once, but to let it grow warm first. 
I must take care also that the fire do not 
come to one of the ends of it — A lucky 
thought!" cried he, quite overjoyed, and 
starting up to make a second trial. 

This succeeded rather better. The pip- 
kin did not split; but, then, on the other 
hand, it was not glazed neither, 

;t How comes this ?'' said Robinson to 
himself. " And yet I thought the fire was 
hot enough. What, can it possibly want 
still!'* After meditating a long time upon 
the matter, he thought, at length, he had 
hit upon the reason. lie had made the ex- 
periment with a fire which was not closed 
up in a stove or oven, but burned in the 
open air. This fire lost its force too soon,

and was too much spread on every side to 
heat the earthen ware sufficiently for glaz- 
ing it. Robinson, therefore, determined 
to stick to his principle of not doing things 
by halves, and to construct a proper open 
or furnace like those in the potteries; but 
for this it was requisite that the weather 
should be more favourable. 

For, you must know, it rained still in- 
cessantly; nor did the sky, at last, begin 
to clear up till after the expiration of two 
months. Robinson thought now that the 
winter was going to set in ; whereas, behold 
ye, the winter was past ! He could scarce 
believe his eyes, when he saw every appear- 
ance of spring — the grass green and ten- 
der, the trees budding out and blossom- 
ing, and fresh flowers beginning every 
where to blow ; and yet it really was so. 
The thing was beyond his comprehension, 
though he saw it clearly before his eyes 
H This will be a warning to me," said he, 
*• never for the future to deny any thing 
hastily that I do not understand."

he had said so? 

Geo. Oh ! mamma, we are none of us 
the least sleepy. 

Mr. Bill. I am not very positive whether 
he did or not; my information fails me in 
that respect. However, as I find nothing 
else remarkable in this day's occurrences, 
as they appear in the old history of Robin- 
son's adventure on the island, I presume 
that, after these words, he actually did go 
to bed. And we will do the same, that, 
like him, we may rise tomorrow with the

and salt and lemons, and fish and turtle, 
and oysters; and do not the lamas give

Mr. Bill. So lie has too, for some time 
past, though I forgot to mention it. 

Geo. Well, and then 1)5 has a bow and 
arrows, and* a spear, and a snug place to 
]ive in. What more could lie wish? 

Mr, Bill. Robinson knew very well the 
value of all these good things, and thanked 
God for them ; nevertheless, lie would have 
given the half of his remaining life for the 
arrival of a ship that would carry him to his 
own country. 

Geo. Ay ! why what did he want still? 

Mr. Bill. Many things; an infinite deal 
of things, not to say every thing, He want- 
ed 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 2?1 

ed those blessings without which there can 
be no* true happiness here below, as society, 
friends, beings of his own species, whom 
he might love, and by whom he might be. 
in his turn, beloved. Far from his parents, 
whom he had so severely afflicted; far from 
his friends, whom he could not hope ever 
to see again; far from men, from all men, 
from all the world ; alas ! in this melan- 
choly, what joy could he taste, had he even 
the richest abundance possible of all the 
good things which this earth affords? Try, 
my little friend, try only once, but for 
one single day, to be quite alone in a soli- 
tary place, and then you will know what a 
life of solitude is ! 

Besides, Robinson was far from having 
his many other wants gratified. His cloaths 
were falling by degrees all to rags; nor 
did he know .how he was to have new 
cloaths when these should be past use. 

Rich. Oh ! As to cloaths, he might very 

well do without them in an island where it 

was so hot, and where there was no winter. 

M 4 Harriet, 



372 THE NEW 

Harriet. Oh fie ! would you have him 
go naked ? 

Mr. Bill. It is true, he had no occasion 
for cloaths to protect him from the cold; 
but he had much occasion for them to 
guard his body from the insects with which 
this island swarmed, particularly muski- 
toes. 

Edw. What are these creatures, these 
muskitoes? 

Mr. Bill. A sort of flies, whose sting is 
much more painful than that of ours. In 
whatever country they are found, they 
torment the natives exceedingly; for their 
stings produce almost as painful swellings 
as those of bees or wasps do with us. Ro- 
J)inson's face and hands were almost always 
swelled with them. Now, what must he 
expect to suffer when once his cloaths 
were worn out! and that time was coming 
very fast. 

This, together with his earnest and long- 
ing desire to behold his parents, and society 
in general, once more drew many a sigh 

from 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. £73 

from him, when standing on the sea-shore, 
and looking, with moistened eyes, over the 
boundless ocean, he could distinguish no- 
thing but the sea and sky. How did his 
heart sometimes flutter with empty hope, 
when, in the distant horizon, he perceived 
a small cloud, which his imagination repre- 
sented to him as a ship in full sail ! And 
when, at length, he discovered his mistake, 
how the tears would trickle from his eyes, 
and his heart seem ready to burst as he- 
returned home slowly to his habitation ! 

Harriet. He should have prayed for 
the coming of a ship; perhaps his prayers 
might have been heard. 

Mr. Bill. He did so, my dear Harriet. 
He prayed night and day for his deliver- 
ance from the desert island; but he never 
forgot, at the same time, to add, " Not 
mine, O Lord ! but thy will be done." 

Harriet. Why did he add that? 

Mr* Bill. Because he was now perfectly 

convinced that the Supreme Being knows 

much better than we do what is for our in- 

M5 terests. 



2?4 THE NEW 

terests. He reasoned thus: " If it he the 
good pleasure of my heavenly Father to let 
me remain here longer, he certainly has 
very good reasons for it, though I cannot 
see them ; consequently, I ought to pray for 
my liberty, barely on condition that his wis- 
dom shall think it to be for my advantage.'' 

Lest a vessel should happen any day to 
pass or cast anchor near the island, at a 
time when he was not near the sea-shore, 
he resolved to fix, on the neck of land 
which jutted out towards the sea, a signal 
by which all who should come in sight 
might be informed of his distress. This 
Mgnal was no more than a pole, on the 
top of which he fastened a banner. 

Edw. i Ay! where did he get the ban- 
ner? 

Mr. Bill. I am going to tell you. His 
shirt was then in such a state, that it was 
impossible to wear it longer. He took, 
therefore, the largest slip of it, shaped it 
into a kind of banner or flag, and fixed it 
on the pole that he was to stick up. 

He 



ROBINSON CltUSOE. 27 '5 

He would have been very glad to put up 
also, on his pole, a label, with an inscription, 
to give a clearer idea of his distress ; but 
bow was this to be done? The only way in 
his power Mas to cut out the letters with 
ills knife of flint. Next to this the question 
was, in what language the inscription should 
be. If it were English, there might come 
by ships of other nations, as Dutch, .Spa- 
nish, or French, and the people might hap- 
pen not to understand it. Luckily he re- 
collected some Latin words, by which he 
could express what he wished. 

Geo. But would seamen understand that? 

3f)\ Bill. The Latin language, you 
know, is common in all countries of Europe, 
and most men who have received any edu- 
cation, know, at least, something of it. 
Hence Robinson hoped, that, in whatever 
ship passed that way, there might be one 
or two, at least, who would understand his 
inscription. He, therefore, put it up. 

Rich. What was it, then ? 

Mr. Bill. Ferte opem misero Robinson ! 
Do von understand, George? 



276 THE NEW 

Geo. Yes, papa. Help the unfortunate 
Robinson ! 

Mr. Bill. His greatest inconvenience 
now was the want of shoes and stockings. 
They were fallen to pieces, and the mus- 
kitoes did so furiously attack his naked 
legs, that he knew not where to fly from 
them. His face, his hands, and his feet, 
were so swelled hy the stings of these in- 
sects, since the raining season, during 
which they had multiplied prodigiously, 
that he seemed no longer to be the same 
person. 

How often did he sit down in his study- 
ing corner, to think of some way to cover 
himself! But always to no purpose. He 
had neither instruments nor skill to pro- 
vide himself with what he wanted, and 
what he found so indispensably necessary. 

The skins of the lamas that he had killed 
appeared the readiest means whereby he 
might clothe himself; but these skins were 
still raw and stiff, and unfortunately lie 
had never troubled himself concerning the 
manner in which tanners and curriers pre- 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 277 

pared the rawhides; and even if he knew 
how to do this, he had neither needle nor 
thread to sew the leather, or make it serve 
for any part of his dress. 

Nevertheless, necessity was pressing. 
He could neither work by day, nor sleep 
by night, the flies did persecute him so in- 
cessantly with their stings. Something 
must be clone, or some fortunate accident 
take place to hinder him from perishing in 
the most miserable manner. 

Henri/. In fact, to what purpose were 
these miserable insects created, since they 
are only a trouble and torment to us ? 

Mr. Bill. Why, 1 might, in my turn, 
ask you, to what purpose were we created, 
you and I, and other men ? 

Henry. On purpose that we might be 
happy in the world. 

Mr. Bill. And what could have induced 
our Creator to propose this object to him- 
self, in creating us ? 

Henry. His goodness, which is so great 
that he did not desire to be happy alone. 

Mr; 



273 THE NEW 

Mr. Bill. Very well, and do you not 
think that these insects also enjoy a sort 
or* happiness ? * 

Henri). Yes, that I can easily imagine. 
We see how they rejoice when the sun 
shines and it is pretty hot. 

Mr. Bill. Right ; and does not this rea- 
son give you to understand to. what pur- 
pose they were created? Namely, that they 
also may rejoice* upon the earth, and be 
as happy as their nature will permit them. 
Is not this purpose perfectly consistent 
with infinite goodness? 
. Henry. Yes ; only I think that the Su- 
preme Being might have created such 
animals alone as do harm to nobody. 

Mr. Bill. Be thankful, to your Creator 
that he has done no such thing. 

Henri/, Why ? 

Mr. Bill. Because, otherwise, neither 
you nor I nor any of us would ever have 
existed. 

Henry. Mow so ?

his creatures in such a manner that one is 
obliged to live upon others: for, if he had 
not dqne so, he couM not have created by 
one half so many species of animals as he 
has, because grass and the fruits of the 
earth would have been sufficient but for a 
few species of living creatures. To the 
end, therefore, that all nature might be 
animated— that there might be every where, 
in the water, in the air. and on the earth, 
living animals which should rejoice in their 
existence, and to the end that one species 
of creatures might not multiply too much 
to the destruction of another, it was ne- 
cessary that our wise and good Creator 
should destine some of his creatures to fur- 
nish the subsistence of others Thou thy- 
self, friend fly, dost feast on the blood of 
other animals, and even on ours. Why 
shouldst thou take it amiss if the spider

What think you, Henry? W T ould not the 
fly, if it were wise, be contented with this 
answer ? 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 281 

Henry. I don't know, papa. I am con- 
tented. 

Mr. Bill Well, now we will return to 
our friend Robinson. 

Necessity forced him to help himself the 
best he could. He took the skins, there- 
fore, and cut out of them with his knife of 
flint, but not without a great deal of trou- 
ble, first a pair of shoes, and then a pair of 
stockings. He could not sew either of them : 
he was obliged, therefore, to content him- 
self with making eyelet-holes in them, and 
lacing them to his legs and feet with a 
string; wiich was no doubt subject to great 
inconveniences : for though he turned the 
hair outwards, he still felt a violent heat in 
his feet. Besides, the skin, which was stiff 
and hard, blistered his feet, and took the 
skin off at the least attempt that he made 
to walk, and so caused him very great pain. 
However, he chose to endure this rather 
than the stings of the muskitoes. 

Of another piece of skin, which was very 
stiff and a little bent, he made a mask, 

cutting- 



282 • THE NEW 

cutting iii it two small holes for the eyes, 
and another for the mouth, that he might 
be able to breathe. 

And, since he had begun this work, he 
resolved not to quit it until he had finished 
with making himself a jacket and trowsers 
of lamas skin. It is true, this task was 
much more difficult ; but have we any thing 
without trouble? and MJiat is there in 
which we do not succeed at last, with the 
requisite patience and application ? Thus 
lie also accomplished his design, which 
filled him with inexpressible joy. 

The jacket was composed of three pieces, 
which were joined together by strings. 
Two of these pieces served for the arms, 
and the third for the body. The trowsers 
consisted of two pieces, one before and one 
behind, and they were laced at the sides. 
When the jacket and trousers were finish- 
ed, he put them both on, with the resolu- 
tion never to dress himself again in his old 
•European cloaths, which were half torn to 
pieces, except upon the birthdays of his fa- 
ther 



ROBINSON" CRUSOE. 285 

ther and mother, which he celebrated as 
solemn festivals. 

H is dress was then the most singular that 
can be imagined : from head to foot cover- 
ed in skins, with the hair outwards; instead 
of a sword, a large hatchet of stone by his 
side ; on his back a pouch, with a bow and 
quiver of arrows ; in his right hand a spear 
almost twice as long as himself, and in his 
left a wicker umbrella, covered with leaves 
of the cocoa-nut tree : lastly, upon his 
head, instead of a hat, a cap of wicker- 
work, rising in a point, and covered in the 
same manner with skins, the hairs out- 
ward. Imagine to yourselves what a figure 
all this must cut : nobody that saw him 
accoutered in this extraordinay equipage, 
would suspect him to be a human creature: 
nay, he could not help laughing at himself, 
when, being on the bank of a rivulet, he 
saw his image in the water in this dress for 
the first time. 

After this, he resumed his potter's work. 
The oven was soon finished, and then he 

had 



284 THE NEW 

had a mind to try whether, by force of an 
exceeding great fire, hecould notproducea 
sort of glazing on his pots. He put them, 
therefore, and his pipkins into it, afterwhich 
he made up by degrees so great a fire, that 
the oven was red hot from one end to the 
other, This violent fire he kept up until 
evening, suffering it then to go out by de- 
grees, and being very curious to know the 
result of bis labour. But what, think ye, 
was the result of it ? The first pot that he 
took out was not glazed, notwithstanding 
allthathehad done, nor the second neither, 
nor, in short, any of them. But, at last, in 
examining one of thepipkins, he perceived, 
with equal joy and surprise, that this, and 
this alone, was covered at bottom with a 
real glazing. 

This was to him a riddle which he could 
by no means solve. " What reason in the 
world could there be," said he, " why this 
single pipkin is a little glazed, and not one 
of the other vessels, though they were all 
made of the same earth, and baked in one 

and 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 285 

and the same oven ?-V — He thought and 
thought again, but he was a long time be- 
fore he could see the least glimpse of any 
thing that seemed likely to explain the 
mystery. 

At length, he recollected that there had 
been a little salt in this pipkin when he 
put it into the oven. He could not help 
thinking, therefore, that the salt alone 
must be the cause of the glazing. 

Rich. But was it really the salt, papa, 
that produced this effect r 

Mr. Bill. Yes: what Robinson now dis- 
covered by chance has been long known 
in Europe; the addition of salt is the true 
cause why many things turn to glass in the 
fire : so that he only need have rubbed the 
earthen ware with saltwater, or barely have 
thrown a little salt into the oven when 
heated, and immediately all his pots would 
have been properly glazed. 

This, therefore, he resolved to try the 
next day. And now the fire blazed under 
his oven, and already he had rubbed some 

of 



£8() THE NEW 

of his vessels with salt water, and put dry 
salt in others, on purpose to make the two 
experiments at the same time, when, in the 
midst of his work, he was interrupted by 
an aceident which he had dreaded a long- 
time — he was taken ill. He felt pains in 
his breast and head, and a great weariness 
all over his limbs, and was threatened with 
the most terrible situation that a man can 
possibly experience. 

" Good Heaven !" said he to himself; 
" what will become of me if I cannot rise 
out of bed ! if there is no compassionate 
being to take care of me, and come to my 
assistance in my illness! no friend to wipe 
off the sweat of death from my forehead, or 
offer me any refreshment!— Heavens! what 
will become of me V 

Sinking under the weight of his distress, 
as he said these words he fell to the ground, 
quite exhausted. 

Ah! it was in this moment of trial that 
he had more occasion than ever to possess a 
firm and filial confidence in his heavenly Fa- 
ther, who is every where present, and su- 



ROBIXSOX CRUSOE. 287 

premely good. Deprived of all human as- 
sistance, forsaken by bis own strength, what 
remained to prevent bis dying in- misery? 
Nothing but the assistance of God ; no 
other support had be to expect in the 
whole world. 

He was on the ground in an agony of dis- 
tress: his hands were clasped strongly toge- 
ther; and, unable to speak, unable to think, 
he looked stedfastly up towards heaven. 
" Oh, Lord ! Oh, Lord ! Mercy !" was all 
thathecouldutternowand then, fetchingat 
the same time most heavy sighs and groans. 

But this state of anxiety did not suffer him 
long to remain inactive. He mustered up 
what strength he had still remaining, in or- 
der, if possible, to place near his bed what- 
ever he should most want for refreshment, 
that he might not be entirely destitute of 
it, in case the sickness absolute!} prevented 
him from rising, He was barelv able to 
cany a couple of cocoa-nut shells full of 
water, and place them beside his bed. He 
next laid some roasted potatoes there, and 

four 



288* THE NEW 

four lemons which he had still remaining, 
and then, not able to stir an inch farther, 
he fell down with weariness on his miser- 
able bed. 

If it had pleased his Maker to take him 
out of the world by asudden death, how con- 
tentedly would he have y ielded up his life! 
He even prayed that it might be so; but very 
soon he reflected that this prayer was not 
reasonable. " Am I not a child of God?" 
said he to himself; " Am I not the work of 
his hands? is he not my father, and a ten- 
der, wise, and almighty father? How have 
I, then, the boldness to prescribe to him what 
he should do with me? Doth he not know 
best what is good for me, and will he not 
act so as to allot me that which is good ? 
Yes, he will; God is benevolent, merciful, 
and almighty. Be at rest, then, O my soul; 
turn thee to thy Maker in those moments of 
discomfort— towards thy God— who delivers 
from all distresses ! He will assist thee,he will 
assist thee, whether in life or in death!" 

After these words he was somewhat en- 
couraged, and raising himself upon his knee«, 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. £ $§ 

he prayed with all the earnestness possible, 
saying, " I resign myself to thee, O my 
heavenly Father; I resign myself to thy 
fatherly guidance ! Dispose of me accord- 
ing to thy good pleasure. I will bear con- 
tentedly whatsoever thou allottest me; 
only grant me strength to bear — it is all 
that I ask of thee. O merciful Father, 
grant me patience under my afflictions, 
and an unshaken confidence in thee. Hear 
this prayer, this only earnest prayer of thy 
poor child who is in misery; hear it for 
thy tender mercy's sake!" 

At the same time he was attacked with 
a violent ague. Though he covered him- 
self all over with the dried lama skins, yet 
he could not keep himself warm. This cold 
fit lasted full two hours, and was succeeded 
by a hot fit, which was like a burning fire 
through all his veins. His breast, by the 
violent beating of his pulse, heaved and 
sunk like the breast of a person that is out 
of breath with running. In this terrible 
situation he had scarce strength enough to 

Vol. I. N ' lift 



$90 THE NEW 

lift the cocoa-nut shell, with the water in 
it, to his mouth, that he might cool his 
burning tongue. 

At length a violent sweat broke out all 
over his body in great drops, and that af- 
forded him some ease. When, at the end of 
about an hour, it abated, he recovered his 
spirits a little, and then he was distrest with 
the idea that his fire would go out if fresh 
wood was not put on. He crept, therefore, 
weak as he was, upon all fours, and threw 
as much wood upon the hearth as would 
be sufficient to keep the fire until the next 
morning; for night was now approaching. 

It was the worst night that ever he pass- 
ed in his life. The cold and hot fit of his 
ague followed each other without intermis- 
sion. He had a violent and continual pain 
in his head, and could not close his eves 
the whole night. All this weakened him 
so much, that in the morning he was 
scarcely able to crawl towards the heap of 
wood to replenish his fire. 

Towards evening his illness increased 

afresh ; 



-R0BIN30X CRUSOE. 29 T 

afresh; he tried again to go as far as the 
hearth, hut for this time he found himself 
imahle. He was obliged, therefore, to give 
up all thought of keeping in his fire; and 
this, in effect, soon became a matter of 
indifference to him, as he now expected 
death to approach in a short time. 

This night was as restless as the last. In 
the mean time the fire went out; the re- 
mainder of the water that was in the cocoa- 
nut shells began to spoil, and Robinson was 
no longer able to turn himself in his bed. 
He thought he felt the approach of death, 
and his joy on this account afforded him 
sufficient strength to prepare himself for 
his last journey with a de\ T out prayer. 

He again humbly asked forgiveness of 
God for his sins, and then thanked him for 
alf the blessings that he had vouchsafed 
him — unuorthv as he was — during the 
whole course of his life. But, particularly, 
he thanked him for the afflictions which had 
been sent him for his amendment, and he 
acknowledged sincerely how wholesome 
they had been to him. Lastly, he praye j 



292 THE NEW 

for the comfort and happiness of his poor 
parents; after which, he recommended his 
, immortal soul to the eternal mercy of his 
God and Father. — He then settled himself, 
and waited for death with joyful hope. 

And, indeed, death seemed to advance 
fast; his pains increased, his breast began. 
to rattle, and his breathing became more 
and more difficult. Ah ! behold the wish- 
ed-for moment ! It seems to come at 
length. A pain, such as he had not felt 
before, seized his breast; he suddenly 
stopt breathing, felt a convulsive shudder- 
ing, sunk down on his bed, and was de- 
prived of sense and motion. 

All the young company remained silent 
for a pretty long time, and by their sorrow 
shewed the respect that they bore to the 
memory of their friend whom they had never 
seen — w< Poor Robinson !" cried some of 
them, sighing. " Heaven be praised ! said 
others; " he is now delivered out of all his 
pain!" And thus they separated for that 
evening, rather more quietly and with more 
appearance of thoughtfulncss than usual.

TWELFTH EVENING. 



Charlotte. Weil, P a P a, what wii 

you read us this evening? 

Mr. Bill. You all seem to expect, i>y 
dears, that I should read you something 
instructive and amusing for this evening. 
What say ye? shall 1 go on with the ad- 
ventures of Robinson Crusoe? 

Charlotte. How! why, Robinson is dead. 
Rich. Do not be in a hurry, Charlotte. 
He may have recovered. Don't you re- 
member that we thought him dead once 
before? And'yet he was alive. 

Mr. Bill, We left Robinson, after his 
convulsive shuddering, fallen into a swoon, 
deprived of sense and motion, and, in short, 
more dead than alive: nevertheless, he 
came to himself again, and recovered his 
senses and facultits. 

N 3 The 



2<H THE NEW 

The children. Ah ! that is right — we 
arc all of us glad that lie is not dead. 

Mr. Bill. The first token of his breath- 
ing again was a deep sigh. He opens his 
eyes, looks round him to know where he 
is. At that moment he doubts his being 
alive; but his doubts were soon removed. 
He, then, falls into a frt of melancholy, 
and, in his present situation, would have 
preferred death to life. 

He feels himself very weak, but free from 
all troublesome pain. The burning heat, 
which tormented him before, is now suc- 
ceeded by a kindly sweat all over his body. 
To encourage it, he covers himself well up 
with skins, and before half an hour was at an 
end, he found himself considerably relieved. 

lint now lie was seized with a violent 
thirst. The water that remained was no 
longer drinkable: luckily, he thought of 
his lemons: he p.it one of them to his mouth, 
and so weak was he that his teeth could 
scarcelv enter it; but when he had sucked 
a little of thejuice, he found himself grealy 

re freshed, 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 295 

refreshed, and his thirst quenched. He now 
composed himself to rest, his perspiration 
still continuing, and enjoyed an agreeable 
slumber until sunrise. 

How pleasing was the sense of his ex- 
istence at present, compared with what he 
had felt the day before ! The violence of 
his disorder was entirely abated; nothing 
remained of it but an excessive weakness. 
He found his appetite return already; he 
took a roasted potatoe, and sprinkled it 
with a drop of lemon-juice, to render it 
less insipid and more refreshing. 

For two days past he had taken no no- 
tice of his lamas ; they now afforded a mov- 
ing sight: some of them looked at him, 
and seemed to ask if he were recovered yet. 
Fortunately these animals, as well as ca- 
mels, can do without drinking for several 
days, otherwise they would have been very 
badly off, having never wet their lips for 
two days. Besides, Robinson being yet too 
weak to rise and fetch them water, they 
N 4 were 



£^5 THE NEW 

were likely to be deprived of it still for 
some time. 

The oldest of the lamas having come up 
close to him, he exerted the little strength 
that he had in milking her, that she might 
not go dry. Her milk, no doubt, assisted 
Robinson's recovery; for, after drinking 
it, he fofind himself considerably better. 

After this, he fell asleep again, enjoyed 
a most refreshing slumber, and did not 
awake until sunset, He perceived that his 
appetitewas increased : he satisfied it again 
with some potatoes sprinkled with lemon- 
juice, and then went to sleep once more. 

This calm, uninterrupted sleep, together 
with his good constitution, contributed so 
effectually to the recovery of his strength, 
that the very next morning he was able 
to rise and attempt to walk a few steps, 
though he still staggered with weakness. 

He crawled out of his cave into the space 
before it. There he lifts up his eyes to 
Heaven, Some beams of the rising sun, 

piercing 



ROBINSON" CHUSOE. 297 

piercing through the leaves of the trees 
that surrounded him, shone agreeably on 
his face, and re-animated him with their 
pleasing warmth. He thought he felt him- 
self receive new life. " Eternal source of 
being!" cried he, " God of my life ! what 
thanks shall I render thee for giving me to 
behold, once more, the bright star of day, 
and by its light the wonderful works of 
thy hands ! Receive my gratitude, for that 
thou didst not forsake me when all forsook 
me; for that thou hast restored me to life 
afresh, doubtless in order that I may have 
more time -to devote to repentance, and 
that I may not waste a moment of my re- 
maining life without forwarding that work, 
the only one tiring needful, that I may ever 
be found ready to take my flight towards 
the place of man's eternal destination, 
where each shall receive the reward of his 
good or bad actions." 

From these effusions of gratitude towards 
his Creator, he naturally passed to the ad- 
miration of the creatures. His looks wan- 
N 5 dered 



£98 THE N£w" 

dered, sometimes, over the immensity of 
heaven's azure vault; sometimes over the 
fresh and smiling verdure of the~trees and 
shrubs, besprinkled with pearly dew, some- 
times on his lamas, which, by crowding- 
round him,seemed to caress him and express 
their joy. He felt a pleasing emotion, like 
that of a traveller, who, after a long ab- 
sence, enters, once more, the bosom of his 
beloved family. His heart being moved 
with tenderness, and overflowing with the 
kindest sentiments, which sought, as it were, 
to expand themselves, he shed a flood of 
tears; but they were tears of the purest joy* 

The advantage of being able to take the 
air, and the use of milk mixed with spring 
water, together with the con tented ness of 
his mind, contributed to his perfect reco- 
very. In a few days all his strength re- 
turned, and he found himself in a capacity 
to begin again his former occupations. 

He went first to examine his new-made 
earthen ware, and to see how it had succeed- 
ed. As soon as he opened the oven, what 

an 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. Q99 

an agreeable surprise ! All his vessels were 
as well glazed as if they had been the work 
of an experienced potter. In the height of 
his joy for this success, he does not per- 
ceive that his ware is of no use to him ; he 
forgets that his fire is out. When, atlength, 
he recollected this circumstance, he stood 
motionless for a while, and, hanging his 
head, fixed his eyes, sometimes on his 
pots, sometimes on his fire-place, and 
ended with heaving a deep sigh. 

Nevertheless, he was able this time to 
moderate his vexation, and to contain it 
within due bounds. * " The same good Pro- 
vidence,"' said he to himself, " which before 
provided you with fire, has always more 
than one way at hand to provide you with 
it again, and you will not be deprived of 
it, if Heaven thinks fit." Besides, he was 
already taught that he had not the rigors 
of winter to fear; and though he was accus- 
tomed, from his childhood, to live chiefly 
on meat, yet he hoped to be able, and not 
N 6 incon- 



300 TNL NLV/ 

inconveniently, to do without it, and live 
upon fruits and the milk of his lamas. 

Charlotte. Why, he might have used his 
smoked, meat for victuals; there would 
have been no necessity for dressing* it. 

Mr. Bill. That is true: but how was 
he to have smoked meat? 

Charlotte. O! I forgot that. 

Mr. Bill. After all, he was not sorry that 
he had made the pots and pans : they were 
convenient to hold his milk, and the largest 
he intended for a very particular use. 

Rich. What was that? 

Mr. BilL He. thought, if his potatoes 
were accompanied with butter, he should 
relish them better than without. 

Rich. I suppose- so. 

Mr. Bill. Not being able to make a 
churn of wood, he had a mind to try whe- 
ther he could not churn butter in a large 
earthen pot. He gathered, therefore, as 
much cream as he thought would be suffi- 
cient. He shaped out also a round flat 
piece of wood, in the center of which he 

made 



13 




ROBINSON CRUSOE. SOI 

made a bole to receive a stick. This in- 
strument he held upright in the cream pot 
and moved it with an incessant motion up 
and down, up and down, until the butter 
was, at length, separated from the butter- 
milk. He then washed the butter in clean 
spring water, and made it up with a little 
salt. 

He was now, onoe more, happy in the 
accomplishment of his design ; but, at the 
very moment when he was going to reap 
the fruits of his industry and perseverance, 
he recollected that he must think no more 
of potatoes, for want of fire to roast them ; a 
circumstance which, in the warmth of exe- 
cuting his design, kehad never once thought 
of. He has butter, but he can make no use 
of it; he looks at it, he uishes for it, he puts 
it from him, he grows sorrowful. Disap- 
pointed in his hopes, he finds himself just 
as he was at first, in danger of wanting 
every thing. It is true, the oysters, the 
milk, the cocoa-nuts, and flesh, either raw 
or dried in the sun, might afford him nou- 
rishment ; 



302 THE NEW 

rishment; but was it certain that no acci- 
dent would deprive him of these resources? 
And the most deplorable of all was, that 
lie could invent no means to render Ins 
unhappy lot better or more secure. 

What shall he undertake now? What- 
ever his hands, without the help of tools, 
were capable of performing, he has already 
executed; and it seems now as if he had 
nothing left to do but to pass the remainder 
of his life in idleness and sleep. Dreadful 
destiny ! He cannot bear the thought of it. 
He was now become so accustomed to work 
that he could not live without employing 
his time in some useful occupation. In 
the latter part of his life, he would often 
say, that bis reformation was principally 
owing to this single circumstance; that he 
was constrained, when in solitude, and de- 
prived of all assistance, to provide for his 
wants himself by persevering labour; and 
he would add, " Constant employment is 
the mother of a crowd of virtues, as ha- 
bitual idleness is the source of all vice." 

Rich. 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 303 

Rich. He was very right; when one has 
nothing to do, one thinks of nothing but 
follies and nonsense. 

Mr. Bill. It is men so; and, therefore, 
young persons are advised to accustom 
themselves early to employment. The 
character that we chiefly put on when we 
are young, as idleness or industry, activity 
or slowness, virtue or wickedness, gene- 
rally remains with us all our lives. 

Edw. We should apply that to ourselves. 

Mr. Bill. Do so, my dear children, and 
conduct yourselves accordingly : you will 
never repent it. Our unfortunate Robin- 
son turned and turned again on every side 
to try what he might undertake, in order to 
avoid idleness. At length he found an em- 
ployment. Can you guess what it was? 

Rich. Were I in his place, I know what 
I would have done. 

Mr. Bill. Ay ! Let us hear your plan. 

Rich. I would have undertaken to tan 
the lama skins, that their stiffness might not 
hurt me when I put them on. Besides, the 

• hair 



304 THE NEW 

hair must be very inconvenient in a coun- 
try where the heat is so excessive. 

Mr. Bill. How would you have set about 
it? * 

Rick. Oh ! I know very well how the 
tanners do. We have been more than once 
to see them at work. 

Mr. Bill. Well. 

Rich. First they put the raw hides in wa- 
ter, and let them steep there for some days; 
from thence they carry them to the leg, on 
which they scrape them, to force out the 
water with which they are soaked. After 
sprinkling them with salt, they cover them 
up carefully to keep the air from them- 
This they call sweating the skins. In fact, 
they do sweat whilst in this situation: it is 
easy to perceive a steam issue from them. 
Thus prepared, they are easily deprived of 
their hair, which is done by scraping them 
again. After this part of the work, they 
put the skins into what they call the tan, 
composed of leaven, the bark of birch tree, 
and a sharp liquor made with oak bark. 

Lastly, 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 305 

Lastly, they place them in the tan vat, where 
they sprinkle them with a liquor made also 
of oak bark, and from hence they take them 
out to curry or dress them ; in a word, to 
put the finishing hand to them. 

Mr. Bill. Very well, my little friend; 
but do you know for what use skins thus 
prepared by the tanners are intended ? 

Rich. Oh! yes: they are made into 
shoes, boots, coach-harness, and many other 
things. 

Mr. Bill. Other things which do not 
require so soft and pliable a leather as that, 
for instance, of which gloves are made. 

Rich. Oh! no. 

Mr. Bill. Who is it, then, that prepares 
this sort of leather ? 

Rich. The skinner or fellmonger: but 
we have never been in the workshop of 
any who follow that business. 

Mr. Bill. Robinson was nearly in the 
same predicament. He had never been in 
the workshop either of tanner or fellmon- 
ger, consequently he could not endeavour 
to imitate either of them. 



306 THE NEW 

Edzv. Then how does the fellmonger 
manage his skins ? 

Mr. Bill, He begins like the tanner, 
with this difference, that he does not steep 
the skins either in tan or in lime, (for this 
is also used by the tanners) hut he makes 
use of warm water, with hran and leaven, 
and afterwards a lee of ashes : — but we will 
go some ddy and see them at work. 

Rich. If he had known the business even 
as well as any skinner, he could not have 
attempted to dress skins for want of bran 
and leaven. 

Mr. BilL^ That is clear: so that he was 
obliged to give up all thoughts of it. 

Edw. But how, then, did he intend to 
employ himself? 

Mr. Bill. His thoughts were employed 
night and day about building a little boat. 

Rich. What use did he intend to make 
of it? 

Mr. Bill. Do you ask what user To try, 
by means. of it, to return amongst his fel- 
low-creatures, and to deliver himself from 

the 



KOBINTSON CKUSOE. 507 

the solitude towhich he was confined against 
his will, and which was hecome more dismal 
to him ever since he was deprived of fire. 
He had reason to think that the continent 
of America was not far off; and he was de- 
termined, if he had a canoe, be it ever so 
slight, to face every danger, and land, if 
possible, on this continent. Full of this 
idea, he hastened out one day to seek and 
make choice of a tree, which he might con- 
vert into a boat, by hollowing out the trunk 
of it. With this design he traversed seve- 
ral parts of the island where he had never 
been before, and remarked, in his way* se- 
veral plants that were unknown to him, 
and on which he resolved to make experi- 
ments, to find whether they would answer 
the purpose-of food. Amongst others he 
observed some stalks of maize, or Indian 
corn, as it is called. 

Edw. What, that sort of corn of which 
you have two 'fine ears hanging up in the 
back parlour r 

Mr. Bill. The same. He admired the 

large- 



308 THE NEW 

largeness of the heads, or, more properly 
speaking, the ears, on each of which he 
reckoned more than two hundred large 
grains, closely ranged,one hesidethe other, 
and resembling grains of coral. He had 
not the least doubt but this corn might be 
used for food, or even for bread. But how 
was it to be ground ? How was the flour 
to be separated from the £>ran ? How was 
it to be made into bread, or, indeed, into 
food of any sort, without the help of fire? 
Notwithstanding all these considerations, 
he carried off some ears of it with him, in- 
tending to sow the grains. ** How do I 
know," said he, " but I may reap consider- 
able advantage from these in the end ?" 

A little further on he discovered a fruit 
tree of a species quite new to him. From 
this tree hung vast numbers of large 
husks, one of which he opened, and found 
in it about sixty nuts of a particular sort. 
Though they were not very agreeable to 
the taste, yet he put one or two of the 

lijesl huks into his pouch. 

Rich 



ROBINSON CRUSOF. 90& 

Rich. But what fruit might that be? 
Mr. Bill. They were cacao-nuts, of which 
they make chocolate. 

Edw. Ah ! now he may have chocolate 
for the future. 

Mr. Bill. Not so fast. Tn the first place, 
he does not know that he has chocolate- 
nuts in his possession: besides, these nuts 
should be roasted, then bruised, and ground 
up with sugar, and, we all know, he was as 
little provided with sugar as with fire. In 
order to improve the flavour of the choco- 
late, they commonly add different sorts of 
spices, as cardamum, vanilla, and cloves; 
but these were unnecessary niceties to be 
deprived of, which gave him not the least 
concern in comparison with the want of 
fire. 

At length he came to another tree, which 
was as little known to him as the former. 
The fruit of it was as 'arge as that of the 
cocoa-nut tree, but had Beit her husk nor 
shell : the whole was eatable, and of an ex- 
quisite flavour. This tree was also quite 

differently 



310 THE NEW 

differently shaped from the cocoa-nut tree. 
It did not consist, like the latter, of a trunk 
which rises straight up its whole ^height, 
and hears a topping of thick foliage; hut 
this had hranches and leaves, like those 
of our fruit trees. He learned afterwards 
that it was the bread tree, so called be- 
cause its fruit serves the natives for bread, 
sometimes just as it grows, but more com- 
monly pounded and made into a sort of 
dough. 

He observed, that the trunk of this tree, 
from its great age, was already a little hol- 
lowed on one side; and immediately lie 
thought it would answer for the boat that 
he had in contemplation, if he could only 
find means to cut. it down and hollow it 
sufficiently. But then to cut down so use- 
ful a tree, while, on the other hand, it was 
uncertain whether he should ever be able 
to make a canoe of it ! — this thought star- 
tled him. And weigh ins: everv thing for 
and against it, in his own mind, for a long 
time; he carefully marked the spot, that he 

might 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. Sll 

might find it again, and went away without 
having determined upon any thing. 

In his walk he found, what he had long 
wished for, a parrot's nest. The discovery 
gave him a great deal of pleasure. He went 
towards it without the least noise, and was 
stretchiusi out his hands to clap them on the 
nest, when the young parrots, which were 
strong, and well fledged, took to flight, and 
escaped from him all but one, more slow 
than the rest, which could not get away, 
and remained his prisoner. He hastened, 
therefore, home to his habitation, more 
pleased than if he hud found a treasure. 

Edzo But what great advantage did he 
expect from a parrot r 

Mr. Bill. He hoped to teach him to pro- 
nounce some words, that he might have 
the satisfaction of hearing a voice which 
imitated that of man. As to us who live 
in society, who enjoy the happiness of see- 
ing men every day, and hearing them, and 
conversing with them, we, perhaps, may 
look upon it as a very trifling and childish 

satisfaction 



312 THE NEW 

satisfaction which Robinson promised to 
himself from hearing the parrot's chatter; 
but if we place ourselves in the same cir- 
cumstances .with him, we shall easily be 
sensible, that what to us, in our present 
condition, appears but a shadow of pleasure, 
must afford substantial satisfaction to poor 
Robinson in his state of solitude. 

When he came home, he 'made a cage 
as well as he could, in which he lodged his 
new guest, placed it on one side of his bed, 
and went to rest with a mind as happy and 
rejoiced as that of a man who has gained a 
new friend. 



THIRTEENTH EVENING. 



JMl\. BILL. I have assembled you this 
evening sooner than usual, because, my 
dears, I intend to hold a consultation with 
you before I go on with the story. 

The 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 313 

The Children. Well, papa, we are now 
all in our places. What is to be the sub- 
ject? 

Mr. Bill. It is a question which has dis- 
turbed Robinson's mind all night, and has 
not suffered him to close his eyes a mo- 
ment. 

The Children. -.What could it be? 

Mr. Bill. It is this. Shall he cut down 
the bread tree which he saw the day before, 
or leave it standing as it is, uncertain 
whether he should ever be able to make a 
boat of it? 

Rich. I should be far from meddling 
with it. 

Edxv. For my part, I would cut it down. 

Mr. Bill. Here are two opposite votes, 
one for cutting down, the other for pre- 
serving the tree. Let us hear those who 
liave not spoken yet on the subject. 

Geo. I am of the same way of thinking 
with Richard. 

Charlotte. And so am I, papa; we must 
let the tree stand. 

Vol. I. O Henry* 



214- THE NEW 

Henri). No: it must be cut down; the 
unfortunate Robinson must have a canoe. 

Harriet. Indeed I think so too. 

Mr. Bill. The voices are divided, and 
equal on both sides. Let those who are 
for cutting down the tree come on mv 
right hand, and those who are of the con- 
trary opinion on my 'Left. Very well; 
both parties face each other. Let us now 
hear the reasons that each will advance 
in favour of Ins opinion. Richard shall 
speak first, and tell us why he is for saving 
the tree. 

Rich. Because it bears a valuable fruit, 
and the species is rare upon the island. 

Edw. It is but an old tree; the advan- 
tage of gathering fruit from it will not 
last long. 

Rich. How can you tell that? It has 
but. a slight hollow, in it as yet; and how 
many trees do we see, the trunks of which, 
though hollow, do not hinder them from 
bearing fruit for many years? 

Harriet. Let Robinson only graft a few 

slips 



ROB I XS ON CRUSOE. 315 

slips of this tree, he will be sure to pre- 
serve the species. 

Geo. Ay ! Do they grow up and bear 
fruit so soon ? Four or live years may very 
well pass before he has any fruit, 

Henry. And is it not better to have a 
canoe, and return to the society of men-, 
than to stay in his island, though he were 
to feed ever so plentifully upon the bread 
made of the fruit of this tree? 

Rich. Why, ay, if the canoe could be 
finished so very soon. But how is he to 
cut down this tree? How is he to hollow it 
out, with nothing but a stone hatchet? 

Edzv. Let him work with perseverance; 
let him not be impatient: I dare say he 
will accomplish it at last. 

Geo. But he has no sail. What voyage 
can he undertake in an open boat? 

Harriet. He may use oars. 

Charlotte. A pretty notion indeed ! Do 

not you remember when we were in a boat 

down the river, near Putney, and one of the 

watermen's oars broke, he was obliged to 

: O 2 go 



ol6 THE NEAV 

go ashore and borrow another, as he said we 
could not be rowed home with only one? 

Eckv. Oh! that was a large boat, and 
there were nine or ten of us in it. But Ro- 
binson, in his little skiff, wants nothing but 
a pair of oars to guide himself happily far 
away from his present solitary habitation. 

'Mr* Bill You see, my dear children, 
the question is not so easy to-resolve. None 
of the reasons that vou have mentioned on 
both sides had escaped Robinson's attention. 
He had passed the whole night in reflecting; 
for to examine whether it be more conve- 
nient to do a thing or not to do it, is called 
reflecting* Ever si nee Robinson had felt the 
bitter consequences of his hasty resolution 
to travel, he had made it a law with himself 
never to undertake any thing without first 
maturely reflecting upon it ; and in the pre- 
sent case, also, he determines to observe 
that law. Having turned the question and 
examined it in every point of view, he found 
it came to no more' than this : Whether it 
be reasonable to sacrifice a slight, but cer- 
tain 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 317 

tain advantage to a great one, but uncer- 
tain ? Here he recollected the fable of the 
dog, which swimming across a river with 
a piece of meat in his mouth, lost it by en- 
deavouring to snatch at the reflection of it 
in the water. He remembered, on the. 
other hand, the custom of husbandmen, 
who sacrifice grain which they might make 
use of, hut do it with the hope of being* 
richly repaid by a plentiful harvest. 

" Yes," said he to himself, "the dog's 
greediness was folly ; he catched at a vain 
shadow, which it was impossible for him to- 
possess. But the hope of the husbandman, 
on the other hand, is well founded, and bis 
conduct sensible; he has in view a real 
advantage, though, it is true, some acci- 
dents may hinder him from obtaining it. 

" Am I not, therefore, ia the situation of 
the farmer? With persevering labour, may 
I not hope to succeed, at length, in making 
a canoe out of this old tree'? And if. my 
first undertaking succeeds, does reason for- 
bid me to expect that I may escape from this 
O a solitary 



J 18 THE NEW 

solitary island, and arrive, by means of my 
canoe, at some place inhabited by men?" 
This thought, so flattering' to his warmest 
wishes, made a lively impression on him ; 
so that he started up that moment, took his 
hatchet, ran to the tree, and cut into it. 

If ever lie undertook alone: and trouble- 
some task, it was certainly this. A thousand 
other men would have been discouraged ; 
the hatchet would have fallen out of their 
hands after the first stroke; they would 
have looked upon the undertaking, if not 
extravagant, at least as impossible. But we 
have seen already, that Robinson made it 
a rule never to suffer himself to be turned 
from his purpose when he had well consi- 
dered it; he was, therefore, unshaken in 
Ids resolution of going through with this 
cnterprize. Were it to cost him twice the 
time and fatigue that it required, yet the 
thought of giving it up would never enter 
his head. From the sun's rising till about 
noon, he never ceased working, and then 
his hand would have covered or filled up 
the \jfhole that he had made in the trunk 



U 




ROBINSON CRUSOE. 319 

by the thousands of strokes which he laid 
on it. From this we may form some idea 
how long a time it will require him to cut 
down a tree of such a thickness, and to 
make a boat of it. 

Being convinced that it would be a work 
of someyears, bethought proper to regulate 
his occupations, and divide his time, so that 
each part of the day might have its own 
work allotted to itself. Experience had 
taught him, that in a life of labour nothing- 
helps industry so much as regularity, and a 
methodical distribution of the work to the 
different hours of the day. I will give you 
an account of the division that he made of 
his time and his occupations, each of which 
had its peculiar portion of the day to itself, 
lie rose at break of day, and went directly 
to the spring, where he washed his head, 
hands, breast, and feet. Having no linen to 
wipe himself dry, he let the air dry his body, 
and assisted it by running, as he generally 
did, straight home to finish dressing him- 
self. He then went up to the top of the 

hillock 



320 THE NEW 

hillock at the foot of which his cave was 
situated. His sight being then hindered by 
no object, he traversed, at one view, all 
the beauties of nature that were comprised 
in this. vast horizon. The sight elevated 
his soul. In the posture, therefore, which 
he thought most respectful, and in the sin- 
cerity of his heart, he worshipped and 
prayed to the Author of all Things; and 
never failed particularly to entreat that he 
would make Ins parents happy, -whom, 
though he had forsaken, he never forgot* 
He then returned to his cave, and milked 
his lamas, which were now encreased in 
number to a little flock. He breakfasted 
on some of the new milk, and the rest lie 
put up in his cellar. These were the cares 
that employed the first hour of the day. 

Now, being* provided with whatever was 
necessary to his security or his convenience 
in working, he went down, if it was low 
water, to the sea side, where he gathered 
what oysters he could find for his dinner; 
if not, he repaired immediately to the tree of 

which 



RO El y SON CRUSOE. S£l 

which he intended to make a canoe. His 
lamas generally followed him, and grazed 
about while he was at work. 

About ten o'clock the heat was generally 
so excessive that he was obliged to quit his 
work. He then went to the sea-side to look 
for oysters, if he had not found any in the 
morning, and at the same time to bathe, 
which he did regularly twice a day. Before 
noon he returned home with his flock. He 
now milked his lamas a second time, and 
prepared a sort of cheese from the milk 
which had curdled, and then laid out his 
dinner, which, being tolerably frugal, was 
soon done. It consisted of new cheese dip- 
ped in milk, some oysters, and half a co- 
coa-nut. There was one circumstance of 
which he had no reason to complain, and 
that was, that he had not by half so great 
an appetite in this hot country as people 
generally have in cold climates : yet, as 
he was accustomed from his childhood to 
eating meat, he longed for it, and, in order 
to satisfy his wish as far as was possible, had 

recourse 



S£2 THE NEW 

recourse to his scheme of drying it in the 
sun. At dinner time, he amused himself 
with his parrot ; he spoke to it, and fre- 
quently repeated certain words, with the 
hope of hearing it pronounce some of them 
one day or another. 

Henri/. What did he feed it with ? 

Mr. Bill. Parrots, when they are wild, 
generally feed upon cocoa-nuts, acorns, the 
seed of gourds, and other such matters : 
when tame, they are fed with whatever is 
fit for a man to eat : so that Robinson was 
very well able to keep his with cheese and 
cocoa-nuts. 

After dinner, he commonly reposed him- 
self, for an hour, either under the shade in 
the open air, or else in his cave surrounded 
by his lamas, and with his parrot at his side. 
Sometimes, as he sat, he would fix his eyes 
upon these animals, and speak to them (like 
a child that speaks to its doll), as if he ex- 
pected them to understand what he said. 
So necessary did he find it to communicate 
his ideas and his sentiments to living crea- 
tures, 



RODINSO.NT CRUSOE. 325 

tures, thathe often forgot the impossibility 
of his being understood by the animals 
which surrounded him. When his parrot, 
which he called Poll, repeated a word dis- 
tinctly, in the height of his joy he would 
imagine that he had heard the voice of a 
man. He forgot island, lamas, parrot, and 
all ; his fancy made him suppose himself in 
the midst of human creatures again. But 
soon recovering from this pleasing illusion, 
and finding himself in a dismal solitude, he 
would sigh heavily, and breathe forth this 
short expression of complaint, " Poor Ro- 
binson !" — About two o'clock 

Edw. How could he always tell what 
hour it was ? 

Mr. Bill. He did as husbandmen some- 
times do ; he observed the height of the 
sun, and judged from thence that it was 
such or such an hour nearly. — About two 
o'clock he returned to the tree to work at 
his grand design. He continued two hours 
each time at this laborious task, and then 
returned to the beach to bathe himself again, 
and to gather more oysters. The rest of 



324 THE NEW 

the clay he spent in working in his garden. 
Sometimes lie sowed maize, or planted po- 
tatoes, hoping that, if he should ever have 
lire again, they might both be of great ad- 
vantage to him. Sometimes he grafted 
from the bread tree; sometimes he watered 
the young grafts : sometimes he would 
would plant a quickset hedge to enclose his 
garden : sometimes he cropped the willows 
which surrounded the space before his 
cave ; he bent and fixed their branches in 
such a manner, that as they grew they 
might form a kind of bower. 

Much to Robinson's grief, the longest 
day was, in his island, but thirteen hours. 
In the middle of summer it was night at 
seven o'clock. Whatever required day- 
light for the performance of it, must be fi- 
nished before thattime. Therefore, as night 
drew on, that is to say, about six o'clock, 
if he had no other more important business 
upon his hands, he went through his exer- 
cise. 

Rich. What does that mean, papa ? 

Mr. 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 3QJ> 

Mr. Bill. It means that he exercised him- 
self at shooting with the bow, and throwing 
the spear, that he might be able to defend 
himself if he should happen to meet with a 
; savage or a wild beast, for he was' never 
perfectly free from the dread of these. By 
degrees, he acquired so great a degree of 
dexterity in both the exercises above men- 
tioned that he seldom missed a mark of the 
size of a crown, though at a pretty good 
distance from him. When night came on, 
he went home to milk his lamas for the 
third time, and took a moderate supper by 
the light of the moon or stars. 

Lastly, he crowned the labours of the 
day by meditating at night upon his own 
conduct. Sometimes he went to sit up on 
the top of the hillock, from whence he 
could behold the starry vault of heaven at 
one view, and contemplate it with admira- 
tion. Sometimes, also, he took a walk upon 
the sea-side, tobreathethe air freshened by 
the evening breeze. Then he would ask 
himself — u How have you spent the day ? 
Vol. I. P Having 



326 THE N£W 

Having received fresh mercies, have you 
blessed' the divine source from which they 
flowed ? Has your heart been filled with 
love and gratitude to your heavenly Bene- 
factor? In your trouble have you put your 
confidence in him? In your gratifications 
have you forgot him ? Have you rejected 
the evil thoughts that offered themselves 
to your imagination ? Have you suppressed 
the extravagant wishes that rose in your 
breast ? In a word, are you become really 
better than you were?" 

Whenever to these or the like questions 
his conscience could return a good answer, 
and testify that the state of his soul was 
comfortable, he sung a hymn to the praise 
of 'he Supreme Being who had assisted him 
in advancing one step in the road to virtue. 
When, on the contrary, he had reason to 
be not so well pleased with himself, the 
thoughts of having thus lost a day filled 
him with sorrow; for he counted the clay 
lost when he had thought or clone any thing 
which he could not approve at night. 

Whenever 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 327 

Whenever this was the case, then close by 
the notch that he made every day upon the 
tree which served him by way of almanack, 
he made two notches crossing each other, 
and this served to put him in mind of .his 
fault, that for the future he might be bet- 
ter on his guard, and not fall into the same 
error. 

Thus, my dear children, Robinson la- 
boured to correct himself and to become 
better every day. Do you also sincerely 
resolve to form your hearts to virtue? I 
advise you to follow the example that he 
now gives you. Like him, reserve an hour 
privately every evening, to give an account 
to yourselves in silence of the manner in 
which you have spent the day ; and, if you 
find, either in your thoughts, words, or 
actions, any thing which your consciences 
dare not avow, keep a book wherein you 
may mark down the same, to put you in 
mind of it from time to time, that. havino- 
before your eyes the fault of which you 
have once been guilty, you may ever after- 
wards

wards take more care to avoid it. By thus 
labouring to improve yourselves every 
day you will also continually increase your 
own satisfaction and happiness. 

My dear children, I doubt not that you 
will afford me every proof of your attention 
and docility, and this very night begin to 
put in practice the good advice which I 
have just now given you.
