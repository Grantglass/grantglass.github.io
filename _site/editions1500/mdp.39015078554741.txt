THE PREFACE
TO THE ORIGINAL EDITION, 1719.
TTF ever the Story of any private Man's Adventures in the Worla
-were worth making Public, and were acceptable when Publish'a\
the Editor of this Account thinks this will be so.
The Wonders of this Man's Life exceed all that (he thinks) is to bt
found extant; the Life of one Man bang scarce capable of a greater
Variety
The Story is told with Modesty, with Seriousness, and with a religious
Application of Events to the Uses to which wise Men always apply
them (viz.) to the Instruction of others by this Example, and to justify
and honour the Wisdom of Providence in all the Variety of out
Circumstances, let them happen how they will.
The Editor believes the thing to be a just History of Fact; neither is
there any Appearance of Fiction in it: And however thinks, because all
such things are dispatch'd, that the Improvement of it, as well to the
Diversion, as to the Instruction of the Reader, will be the same; and as
such, he thinks, without farther Compliment to the World, he does them
a great Service in the Publication
[ The ornamental head-pieces and initial letters are exact fac- similes of those used
it: tIt; First Edition of "Robinson Crtisoe."]
PRELIMINARY.
"T^HE Publisher desires just one word with the reenters of this edition of " Robinson
Crusoe." After making a careful examination of every accessible reprint of
importance from 1719 down to the present time, great was his surprise to find that
not one of the hundreds of so-called "revised editions" had given the correct text of the
Author, but had—to all appearance—copied from each other, adding a few variations
here and there to give an air of originality. Occasionally these variations consist of
such trivialities as the change of one word for another, but the substitution of even
homely for polite expressions assists in spoiling a narrative charming for its perfect
simplicity; thus " home" has been changed to "residence;" "household goods"
to "furniture," &c. Even the text of a late edition in the Globe Library must be
received with some suspicion when the Editor tells us that he '' printed from the edition
of 1719 but collated i! with earlier editions !" which is all nonsense, because there are
no editions earlier than 1719. By the kindness of Mr. Lee, a copy of the very valuable
and rare first edition in two vols., 1719, has been deposited with the printers during
the progress of the work through the press, and there, in a glass case, every word and
letter have been examined in preparing the present edition, which is believed to represent
the only perfect text of Defoe's narrative since the time of its Author.
INTRODUCTION
TO THE PRESENT EDITION.
To Girls and Boys,—Toung and Old,—Everywhere.
ON this twenty-fifth day of April, in the year one thousand eight
hundred and sixty nine, which is exactly a century and a half
since his first appearance in the world, it does seem like an act of
presumptuous supererogation to say,—"Allow me to introduce to
you Mr. Robinson Crusoe, and his Strange Surprizing Adventures!"
Indeed I can almost hear a reply, in a million voices,—of many lan-
guages,—from all points of the compass,—"Why, we have known
him ever since we can remember I"
That may be; yet, without presumption, I think I shall be able to
tell some, at least, of my readers more than they already know.
This then must be my apology. Those who know "all about it,"
and need no " Introduction," may turn over a few leaves, and take
their old acquaintance by the hand, without further ceremony.
The historic original of Robinson Crusoe was Alexander Selcraig,
the seventh son of John Selcraig and Euphan Mackie. He was born
at Largo in the county of Fife, in Scotland, a.d. 1676; and went to
sea in 1695, changing his name to Selkirk. He was not again heard
of until 1701, when he returned to his native place. On the 18th
May 1703, he sailed from the Downs in the Cinque Ports galley,
96 tons, 18 guns, and 63 men, Charles Pickering, captain; Thomas
Stradling, lieutenant; and himself, Selkirk, sailing-master. On the
24th November, the same year, they anchored at La Granda, Brazil,
where Capt Pickering died, and the command devolved upon
Stradling. They left on the 8th December, and on the 10th February,
the following year, cast anchor at the Island of Juan Fernandez.
After taking in wood and water they sailed on the 29th February in
pursuit of a French ship, but returned in the month of September.
In consequence of frequent quarrels between himself and Stradling,
and a fear that the ship was not sea-worthy, Selkirk determined to
leave the vessel; and when she departed at the end of the month
all his effects, with additional necessaries, were taken on shore, and
he remained alone on the island.
On the 2nd February 1709, the privateer ships Duke and Duchess,
commanded by Captain Woodes Rogers, anchored at Juan Fer-
nandez, and found Selkirk there. He engaged in the capacity of
Mate on board the Duke, and they sailed on the iath of the same
month, arriving at Erith, on the Thames, the 14th October 1711.
In the following year, Capt Woodes Rogers published an account
of his voyages, in which he relates the finding of Selkirk, and how he
had lived alone on the island "four years and four months."
Another officer of the same expedition, Capt Edward Cooke, pub-
lished a similar volume during the same year, and states on the title-
page :—" Wherein an Account is given of Mr. Alexander Selkirk, his
"Manner of living and taming some wild Beasts during the four Years
"and four Months he hVd upon the uninhabited Island of Juan
"Fernandez? Sir Richard Steele appears to have had an interview
with Selkirk soon after the arrival of the latter in England, and made
his adventures the subject of No. 26 of The Englishman, published
in December, 1713.
These are all the historical resources known to have been available
for the production of " Robinson Crusoe."
I may, however, add a few particulars as to the subsequent career
of Selkirk. His share of prize money, while on board the ship Duke,
amounted to .£800; which, having received, he set out for his native
place, and arrived there early in 1712. After investing his money he
appears to have remained in Largo until 1717, when he again went
to sea, leaving his property in charge of his relations. He never re-
turned, though he was heard of at times from Bristol, Liverpool, and
London; but he became a Lieutenant in the Royal Navy, and died
in that capacity on board his Maj esty's ship Weymouth, in the year 1723.
The first attempt to collect all the facts that could be ascertained
about Selkirk, was by Isaac James, of Bristol, who, in 1800, published
a small volume, entitled, " Providence Displayed: or, The Remark-
"able Adventures of Alexander Selkirk," &c. &c. A few additional
particulars are contained in "The Life of Alexander Selkirk," by
John Howell, London, 1829. The most recent work, I believe, on
the subject, is entitled " Crusoniana; or, Truth versus Fiction, eluci-
u dated in a History of the Islands of Juan Fernandez, by a Retired
"Governor of that Colony. Manchester. Published by the author.
"1843." The author was Lieut-Col. Thomas Sutcliffe, and his
iccount of Selkirk forms the second chapter of his work, pp. 14-52.
I have yet to state one interesting fact, on the authority of the
Panama Star and Herald of 6th October, 1868; namely, that a
monument had been executed by Messrs. J. Child & Son, Valparaiso,
for erection on the island of Juan Fernandez. Its inscription wi'1
tell its own tale:—
In Memory of
ALEXANDER SELKIRK,
MARINEP,
^ native of Largo, in the County of Fife, Scotland,
Who lived on this Island, in complete Solitude,
For four years and four months.
€ was landed from the Cinque Ports galley, 06 tons,
18 guns, a.d. 1704, and was taken off in the
Duke, privateer, 13th February, 1709.
He died Lieutenant of H.M.S. Weymouth,
AJ). 1723, aged 47 years.
This Tablet is erected near Selkirk's look-out,
By Commodore Powell and the Officers
of H.M.S. Topaze, a.d. 1868.
The above, erected in a desolate island on the opposite side of tht
globe, after the lapse of a hundred and fifty years, is evidence of the
force of intellectual genius exerted by the writer who first made
Selkirk famous. This brings us back to the author of "Robinson
Crusoe," whose imperishable work will still exist, in all its freshness,
when the most endurable monument of marble shall have been re-
solved into its original dust
The great reputation of " Robinson Crusoe" has attached a degree
of interest to every fact connected with its history. As to the
authorship of the work. Nearly fifty years after its first publication
a rumour was alluded to, in the Biographia Britannica, that Dr.
Arbuthnot was the writer; but no reason was given, and the account
concludes with stating:—"it was the delectable Offspring of the
"teeming Brain of Daniel Defoe, a Writer famous in his Generation
"for Politics and Poetry."
A more circumstantial tissue of hearsay appeared about eight years
later, when Mr. T. Warton gravely stated that the Rev. Benjamin
Holloway, of Middleton Stony, told him, that Lord Sunderland
issured him, that the first volume of " Robinson Crusoe" was written
by the Earl of Oxford, while a Prisoner in the Tower, "as an amuse-
ment under confinement,"—and was given to Defoe, who visited
him there; and, that Defoe printed it as his own, with his Lordship's
approbation, adding the second volume, "the inferiority of which is
generally acknowledged." Now, ist, Lord Oxford was so pros-
trated by illness, during the greater part of his imprisonment, that it
was matter of speculation whether or not he would live to be tried.
He was incapable of preparing his defence, and on that account the
House of Lords, from time to time, granted his petitions for post-
ponement of his trial. He was therefore in no capacity to write a
romance "as an amusement under confinement" 2nd,—He was
discharged from his impeachment, by the House of Lords, two years
before " Robinson Crusoe" was heard of. 3rd,—Only the Earl of
Oxford and Defoe could have originally known if there had been any
foundation of truth in the matter, and there is not a tittle of evidence
that either ever uttered a word thereon. 4th,—Lord Sunderland
would have been one of the last to whom they would have communi-
cated the secret, because :—5th,—During the whole of the impeach-
ment against Lord Oxford, Lord Sunderland spoke and voted against
him. There could be no intercourse between the prisoner, and the
man who believed him a traitor, and sought to bring his head to the
block. 6th,—Defoe was in the service of the government, and under
Lord Sunderland's power, during Lord Oxford's imprisonment, and
he so continued when "Robinson Crusoe" was published. Self in-
terest would make him reticent 7 th,—The smallest share of critical
acumen is sufficient to decide not only that the second volume of
"Robinson Crusoe" is not inferior to the first, but that the two
volumes are equally the offspring of the same parent
It seems the singular fate of human greatness to be misunderstood,
disparaged, and comparatively forgotten by the generations imme-
diately succeeding. Shakespeare, Milton, Queen Anne, the Duke of
Marlborough, Daniel Defoe, and many others might be mentioned as
instances of this neglect of posterity. Great men ultimately, however,
become incorporated with the history of their country; and some
ater literary research brings to light much that had been obscured,
and enables after ages to form more accurate judgment of their
characters and genius. Defoe is now much better known than
he was a hundred years ago. Going back to the pamphlets ana
newspapers of the period, it becomes obvious that no doubt whatever
existed, at the time, as to the authorship of " Robinson Crusoe." In
fhe year of its first appearance, and even before the second volume
<fas published, a mutilated abridgment of the first was clandestinely
printed for T. Cox, of the Amsterdam Coffee-House, in London.
When remonstrated with and threatened, he only replied by an
Advertisement in "The Flying Post," in which he abused and in-
sulted Defoe; proving, that although the work was published anony-
mously, there was, even then, no doubt as to the authorship. In the
preface to the first edition of the second volume Defoe alludes to
this transaction. In the same year also, Charles Gildon published a
satirical pamphlet, entitled, "The Life and Strange Surprizing Ad-
"ventures of Mr. D De F , of London, Hosier, who has
"lived above fifty Years by himself, in the Kingdoms of North and
"South Britain. The various Shapes he has appear'd in, and the
"Discoveries he has made for the Benefit of his Country. In a
"Dialogue between Him, Robinson Crusoe, and his Man Friday.
"With Remarks Serious and Comical upon the Life of Crusoe." In
"An Epistle to D D' F—e, the reputed Author of Robinson
Crusoe." The writer confesses that "Crusoe" was already "fam'd
"from Tuttle Street to Limehouse-hole. There is not an old
"Woman," says he, " that can go to the price of it, but buys thy
"' Life and Adventures,' and leaves it as a Legacy, with the
"' Pilgrim's Progress,' the ' Practice of Piety,' and 'God's Revenge
"against Murther,' to her Posterity."
Defoe does not seem to have replied to the above; but when, a
few years later, Bishop Benjamin Hoadley inserted some strictures in
the London Journal about " Robinson Crusoe" filling his pockets with
biscuit, after having previously divested himself of his clothes, Defoe
replied very warmly in Applebeis Journal. In like manner he was
highly incensed at one of the pirates, who then infested the coasts of
Carolina and Virginia, for having named his ship Robinson Crusoe,
and calls him "a most bloody-minded murdering Rogue." A col-
lateral and inferential bearing on the fact of Defoe's authorship may
be found in the chagrin of the booksellers against Mr. William
Taylor, for his having secured to himself the great profits arising from
.he publication of "Robinson Crusoe;" and, that seven or more of
them shortly afterward, entered into a confederacy for the joint pub-
iication of such works of fiction as Defoe might write.
Another unfounded rumour of the generation after Defoe's decease
was, that Selkirk had written some Memoir or Journal, which he
placed in Defoe's hands in order that he might digest it for publica-
tion, but that the latter used the documents for his own purpose to
the damage of their author,—and then returned the papers to Selkirk,
telling him his history would not sell. The answer is simple and
complete. I have stated that Selkirk returned to England in 17 n,—
that the volume of Capt Woodes Rogers, and that of Capt Edward
Cooke were both published in 1712; followed by Sir Richard Steele's
paper in 1713. These three accounts contained what Selkirk had to
say of himself, and being printed, they became public property. Yet
they remained otherwise entirely unappropriated until Defoe's work
appeared in 1719; and, in "Robinson Crusoe," nothing has been
discovered to be historic fact except what he gathered from those pre-
viously published works. I have mentioned the titles of subsequent
accounts of Selkirk, containing many additional particulars of his
adventures, but none of these are to be found in "Robinson Crusoe."
Mr. James and others, to whom we are indebted for investigating the
history of Selkirk, tell us that "John Selkirk, a weavei ^t Largo, in
"1794, was in possession of the Gun and Chest which his great-uncle
"brought from Juan Fernandez; and they also had a drinking Cup
"of Cocoa-nut shell, tipped with silver, which had been his property."
These treasures are known to be still in existence; but of those who
had carefully preserved such relics, Mr. James states (in 1800) "Even
"Selkirk's relations do not know that he left any Journals behind
"him." The conclusion is evident:—That Defoe fairly acquired,
from published accounts, some of the fundamental incidents of
"Robinson Crusoe's" Life; but the ever-varying events that fill up
the historic monotony,—the useful and improving moralities,—and
the fascinating style,—are all his own.
It may add to the interest of " Robinson Crusoe," with young readers,
to know something of the circumstances under which it was written.
There is every reason to believe that Defoe was then quite easy as to
his pecuniary circumstances; yet there is perhaps no parallel in the
world's history to his marvellous literary industry. The following is
an epitome of his known labours, from the appearance of the first
volume of " Robinson Crusoe," on the 25th of April, 1719 (pp. 366),
to the publication, on the 6th of August 1720, of the third volume
(now never reprinted,) entitled " Serious Reflections during the Life
and Surprizing Adventures of Robinson Crusoe. With his Vision of
the Angelick World," &c.
Besides holding a very responsible though objectionable office of
"Censor of Public Journals," under the government of George I., he
edited, at the same time, a monthly publication called Mercurius
Politicus, each number containing not less than 64 pages; a Weekly
fournal;—occasionally The Whitehall Evening Post, published thrice
weekly;—and part of the time a paper called The Daily Post. In
addition to these, the first volume of Crusoe was immediately fol-
lowed by Some Account of the Life, Sic., of Henry Baron Goertz,
(pp. 46.) A Letter to the Dissenters, (pp. 27.) The Anatomy of Ex-
change Alley, (pp. 64.) Then appeared the second volume of Robinson
Crusoe, published on the 20th of August 1719, (pp. 380.) This was
succeeded by Dickory Cronke, (pp. 64.) Charity still a Christian
Virtue, (pp. 72.) The King of Pirates, Captain Avery, (pp. 100.)
The Chimera, (pp. 76.) The Life and Adventures of Mr Duncan
Campbell, (pp. 344.) Campbell's Pacquet, an Apparition, (pp. 14.)
Alemoirs of a Cavalier, (pp. 350.^ The Life, Adventures, and Piracies
of Captain Singleton, (pp. (344.) After which appeared the third
volume of Robitison Crusoe, published on the 6th August 1720,
(PP- 370.)
The aggregate of Defoe's literary labours, during about a year and
a half, including " Robinson Crusoe," exceeds four thousand octavo
printed pages.
I must mention another fact connected with the history of " Robin-
son Crusoe," and its great popularity. Even so minute a circumstance
as the place where it was written has not escaped controversy, and
the claims of different localities have been numerous. Most of these
claims rest upon an erroneous supposition that Defoe was, at that
time, under the frowns of Government, and obliged to conceal him-
self. A house in Halifax, Yorkshire, is pointed out in the history of
that town. Gateshead, in the county of Durham, has claimed the
honour. A house in Harrow-alley, Whitechapel Market, has been
said to be the birthplace of both "Robinson Crusoe" and the Journalof
the Plague, although three years intervened between their publication.
A correspondent assured one of Defoe's biographers that "Robinson
f-

DEFOES HOUSE AT STOKE NEWINGTON.
Crusoe" was written in the back chamber over the washhouse of a
cottage in the little village of Hartley, in Kent It might be deemed
conclusive that Gihlon, writing at the time, lays the scene of the scur-
rilous dialogue already alluded to, in a field at Stoke Newington,
where Defoe would be close to his home. We now know, from more
recent researches, that he was in London, where his duties under
the Government imperatively required his presence,—that he was
under no necessity of concealment:—and, that " Robinson Crusoe"
could only have been written in his own house at Stoke Newington.
But I must now acquaint such readers of " Robinson Crusoe" as
are not already aware of the fact, that besides having Alexander
Selkirk as an "historical Original," there is enclosed, in an occult
manner, throughout its pages, an "Emblematic Original," namely,
that Crusoe contains the principal events of Defoe's own Life.
The first and second volumes contain all the narrative and romantic
part of " Robinson Crusoe;" but I have stated that there is a third
volume, now never reprinted, and little known, entitled Serious Re-
flections, &c. It is filled with metaphysical disquisitions on morals
and religion, divided into chapters and sections:—On Solitude,—On
Honesty,—On Immorality of Conversation,—On the present State of Re-
ligion in the World,—On Divine Providence,—On the proportion be-
tween the numbers of Christians and Pagans,—and a Vision of the
Angelic World. From this brief enumeration of principal topics it
will be obvious that, however interesting these digressive Reflections
may be to the Christian philosopher, this third volume is not adapted
to the same class of readers as the two narrative volumes. It wants
that simple naturalness, the charm of reality,.—which, in them, is
spread over the commonest incidents; and yet,—all concentrating in
one solitary man,—combine to perfect the fascination of the story.
The above may be sufficient to serve two purposes :—first, why
the volume of Serious Reflections has rarely been reprinted with the
narrative, and is also omitted in the present edition ;— and secondly,
why I have thus mentioned it in this Introduction, namely, that the
Preface to the third volume discloses the fact, that the vicissitudes of
Defoe's own Life are parabolically related in the narrative volumes of
the work.
In this Preface he affirms that " the story, though Allegorical, is
"also Historical. Farther, that there is a Man alive, and well known
"too, the Actions of whose Life are the just subject of these Volumes,
"and to whom all or most Part of the Story most directly alludes;
"this may be depended upon for Truth. Without letting the Reader
"into a nearer Explication of the Matter, I proceed to let him know,
"that the happy deductions I have employed myself to make from
u all the Circumstances of my Story, will abundantly make him amends
"for his not having the Emblem explained by the Original. In a
u Word, there's not a Circumstance in the imaginary Story, but has
"its just allusion to a real Story, and Chimes Part for Part, and Step
"for Step, with the inimitable Life of Robinson Crusoe" With re-
spect to the fictitious representation of Crusoe's forced confinement
in an island, he says, " 'tis as reasonable to represent one kind of
"Imprisonment by another, as it is to represent any Thing that really
"exists by that which exists not Had the common way of writing
* a Man's private History been taken, and I had given you the con-
"duct or Life of a Man you knew, and whose Misfortunes and In-
"nrmities perhaps you had sometimes unjustly triumphed over; all
"I could have said would have yielded no Diversion, and perhaps
"scarce have obtained a reading, or at best no attention. The
"Teacher, like a greater, having no Honour in his own country."
From this it is quite clear that Defoe had seriously considered the
propriety, or otherwise, of writing his autobiography; but having in
his surprising adventures, as he goes on to say, "suffered all manner
"of Violences and Oppressions, injurious Reproaches, contempt of
"Men, attacks of Devils, corrections from Heaven, and Oppositions
"on Earth; and had innumerable ups and downs in matters of For-
"tune," he was convinced that the clearing up of his own character
and conduct, in plain words, would be an indictment against the age
in which he had lived. That his contemporaries would either refuse
to read, or would resent it He therefore gave to the world the
eventful story of his own Life, and the lessons contained therein,
under the "Emblem" of Robinson Crusoe, "without letting the
"Reader into a nearer Explication of the matter."
If we could now lay open TAe Life and Strange Surprizing
Adventures of Robinson Crusoe, side by side with Memoirs of the
Life of Daniel Dejoe, and trace throughout the parallels between
what he calls the "Emblem" and the "Original," the results
would be as valuable as interesting; but the attempt would, we
fear, be comparatively in vain. What the author intended to be
only veiled, time has rendered obscure, if not consigned to entire
oblivion.
Having already given the exact dates when the first editions of the
respective volumes of Crusoe were published, I must add a few words (
as to the success of the work. The first volume was so immediately
sold off that a second edition was published on the 12 th May, only
«eventeen days after the first;—a third, on the 6th June ;—a spurious
edition on the 7 th August;—a*.id, on the following day, the fourth
edition appeared. Meanwhile, the author had been busy on the
second volume; and there is reason to believe that its first edition,
on the 20th August, was a very large issue. During the same year
the two volumes were translated into German and French. From
lie 7th October, 1719, to the 19th October, 1720, the first and
second volumes were reprinted in weekly portions, in a newspaper
called the Original London Post, or Hcatheotfs Intelligencer. The
fifth edition was an abridgment, in one volume, on the 19th Nov.
1720 ;—the sixth, in two volumes, 28th October, 1721;—the seventh,
on the 28th February, 1722 ; and the eighth, in two volumes, with 14
copper-plates, (called the 6th Edition,) on the 5th of June, in the
same year. Since then, it has been translated and printed in Italian,
Spanish, Russian, Arabic, and almost every living language that has
become subjected to grammar and the press. Ever Latin and Greek
ire not without their translations of this immortal work. In English,
the editions have been, and continue to be innumerable;—from the
elegantly illustrated, gilt-leaved and morocco-bound, costly edition,
for the aristocratic drawing-room,—down, down, through all sizes,
abridgments, and prices, suited to every grade of society and every
class of readers, to the penny, and even farthing books, vended oniy
from the basket of the itinerant village hawker.
It has been truly said that Defoe took no more of "Robinson
Crusoe" from the accounts of Selkirk than Shakespeare did of Mac-
beth and Hamlet from the old Scotch and Danish Chronicles; yet
we have seen that all the materials, available to Defoe, had been pub-
lished, and were therefore at the service of any other writer, from
six to seven years, though none had made use of them, before the
genius of our author gave to the world his celebrated romance. No
sooner however had the work appeared than its popularity called
forth many imitations, some of them short-lived, but several still
known and read.
Mr. Wilson is mistaken in saying that the first rival of Crusoe was
"Philip Quarll." The following work was published on the 3rd
October, 1719, and it will be at once seen that the name "Vend-
church" is a travestied synonym of Selkirk: "The Adventures and
"Surprizing Deliverances of James Dubourdieu and his Wife, from
"the uninhabited Part of the Island of Paradise, &c. Also the
"Adventures of Alexander Vendchurch, set on Shore on an Island
"in the South Sea," &c. The next was, "The Life and Strange
Surprizing Adventures of Major Alexander Ramkins," &c., pub-
lished the 3rd Dec. 1719. Two days afterwards appeared, "The
"Voyages, Travels, and dangerous Adventures of Captain Richard
"Falconer," &c. Defoe himself further contributed to the love of
maritime adventure by writing,—" The King of Pirates. Being an
"Account of the Famous Enterprizes of Captain Avery, the Mock
"King of Madagascar," &c., published on the 10th Dec. 1719. And
again, on the 4th of June, in the following year, appeared his "Life,
Adventures and Piracies of the Famous Captain Singleton," &c
.
Many of the imitations of Crusoe are now almost forgotten; but 1
may mention "The Voyages and Adventures of Miles Phillips, a
West Country Sailor, &c . Written by Himself," &c published the a6th
Feb. 1724. The colonics of North America must also have their
Crusoe, and in Dec. 1725, a book was published at Boston, New
England, entitled, "The Strange Adventures and Signal Deliverances
"of Mr. Philip Ashton, Jun., Sec. who lived alone upon a Desolate
"Island in the Gulph of Honduras for about Sixteen Months." 1
may also notice, in order of date, while passing, that on the 20th of
January, 1726, was published "A Voyage Round the World by Way
of the Great South Sea, &c. By Captain George Shelvocke."
From this book it aopears that Shelvocke's ship was cast away, the
2£th of May, 1720, on the island of Juan Fernandez, and that he and
his crew remained there until the 6th of October in the same year.
He fully describes the island, but mentions no relics of Selkirk, or of
any previous human inhabitant; and he appears to have been, by
long absence from England, ignorant of the existence of "Robinson
Crusoe." On the 10th of March, 1726, appeared, "The Voyages
and Adventures of Captain Robert Boyle," &c. And in October
of the same year, Dean Swift's celebrated "Travels into several
Remote Nations of the World, by Lemuel Gulliver," &c. The
longest-lived, among the strict imitations of Crusoe, was published on
the 15th of April, 1737, and is entitled "The Hermit: or, the Un-
"paralleled Sufferings and Surprizing Adventures of Mr. Philip
"Quarll, an Englishman. Who was discovered by Mr. Dorrington, a
"Bristol Merchant, upon an uninhabited Island in the South Sea;
"where he has lived above Fifty Years, without any human Assist-
"ance, still continues to reside, and will not come away," &c. This,
though very inferior to Crusoe, is still reprinted in abridged form,
and in numerous editions. I might go on to mention, "A Voyage
to Cacklogallinia, by Captain S. Brunt," published the 15th of July,
1727. And "The Pleasant and Surprizing Adventures of Mr.
"Robert Drury, during his Fifteen Years' Captivity on the Island of
"Madagascar," &c. which first appeared on the 24th of May, 1729;
and, in which, the hero is almost as perfectly isolated inland, among
the barbarous natives, as Crusoe was on his desolate island. I
might enumerate others that appeared between 1730 and 1750, when
"The Life and Adventures of Peter Wilkins, a Cornish Man. Taken
"from his own Mouth in his Passage to England from off Cape
"Horn in America, ir. the Ship Hector," was published. These
however will suffice to show how large a fleet of smaller craft followed
in the wake of that which, in 1719, began its course along the stream
of time, having on board "Robinson Crusoe, of York, Mariner."
Thus, to recapitulate, I have given a brief account of the "His-

The day has long since gone by when "Robinson Crusoe" required
any testimonial as to character.
I have aimed only at adding something to what is popularly known
respecting the history of the book, and hope I have to some extent
succeeded.
Probably few of the present generation, especially of the young,
have ever seen -the first and unabridged edition of "Robinson
Crusoe," except perhaps the one locked up, as a rarity, in a glass
show-case in the British Museum. Scarcely any work has been more
mutilated by printers; and there is reason to doubt whether, in
modern times, the original has ever been reprinted verbatim. I am
able to affirm that the present is an exact reproduction from my own
copy of the first edition. The illustrations by an eminent French
artist have been designed expressly for this edition.

THE
LIFE AND ADVENTURES
OF
ROBINSON CRUSOE, v«

WAS born in the Year 1632, in the City of York,
of a good Family, though not of that Country, my
Father being a Foreigner of Bremen, who settled
first at Hull: He got a good Estate by Merchan-
dise, and leaving off his Trade, lived afterwards at
York, from whence he had married my Mother,
whose Relations were named Robinson, a very good Family in that
Country, and from whom I was called Robinson Krcutznaer; but by
the usual Corruption of Words in England, we are now called, nay
we call ourselves, and write our Name Crusoe, and so my Com-
panions always called me.
I had two elder Brothers, one of which was Lieutenant Colonel to
an English Regiment of Foot in Flanders, formerly commanded by
the famous Col. Lockhart, and was killed at the Battle near Dunkirk
against the Spaniards: What became of my second Brother I never
knew any more than my Father or Mother did know what was
become of me.
Being the third Son of the Family, and not bred to any Trade, my
Head began to be filled very early with rambling Thoughts: My Father,
who was very ancient, had given me a competent Share of Learning,
as far as House-Education and a Country Free-School generally goes,
» ADVENTURES OF
and design'd me for the Law; but I would be satisfied with nothing
but going to Sea, and my Inclination to this led me so strongly against
the Will, nay the Commands of my Father, and against all the En-
treaties and Persuasions of my Mother and other Friends, that there
seemed to be something fatal in that Propension of Nature tending
directly to the Life of Misery which was to befall me.
My Father, a wise and grave Man, gave me serious and excellent
Ccmsel against what he foresaw was my Design. He called me one
M rning into his Chamber, where he was confined by the Gout, and
3xpostulated very warmly with me upon this Subject: He asked me
what Reasons more than a mere wandering Inclination I had for
leaving my Father's House and my native Country, where I might be
well introduced, and had a Prospect of raising my Fortunes by Appli-
cation and Industry, with a Life of Ease and Pleasure. He told me
it was for Men of desperate Fortunes on one Hand, or of aspiring,
superior Fortunes on the other, who went abroad upon Adventures, to
rise by Enterprize, and make themselves famous in Undertakings of a
Nature out of the common Road; that these things were all either too
far above me, or too far below me; that mine was the middle State,
or what might be called the upper Station of Low Life, which he had
found by long Experience was the best State in the World, the most
ruited to human Happiness, not exposed to the Miseries and Hard-
ships, the Labour and Sufferings of the mechanic Part of Mankind,
and not embarrass'd with the Pride, Luxury, Ambition and Envy of
the upper Part of Mankind. He told me, I might judge of the Hap-
piness of this State, by this one thing, viz. That this was the State of
Life which all other People envied, that Kings have frequently la-
mented the miserable Consequences of being bor n to great things, and
wished they had been placed in the Middle of the two Extremes,
Detween the Mean and the Great; that the wise Man gave his Testi-
mony to this as the just Standard of true Felicity, when he prayed to
have neither Poverty or Riches.
He bid me observe it, and I should always find, that the Calami-
ties of Life were shared among the upper and lower Part of Mankind;
but that the middle Station had the fewest Disasters, and was not
expos'd to so many Vicissitudes as the higher or low«r Part of Man-
kind; nay, they were not subjected to so many Distempers and
Uneasinesses either of Bedy or Mind, as those were who, by vicious
Living, Luxury and Extravagances on one Hand, or by hard Labour,
ROBINSON CRUSOE. %
Want of Necessaries, and mean or insufficient Diet on the other
Hand, bring Distempers upon themselves by the natural Conse-
quences of their Way of Living; That the middle Station of Life was
calculated for all kinds of Virtues and all kinds of Enjoyments; that
Peace and Plenty were the Handmaids of a middle Fortune; that
Temperance, Moderation, Quietness, Health, Society, all agreeable
Diversions, and all desirable Pleasures, were the Blessings attending
the middle Station of Life; that this Way Men went silently and
smoothly through the World, and comfortably out of it, not embarrass'd
with the Labours of the Hands or of the Head, not sold to the Life
of Slavery for daily Bread, or harass'd with perplex'd Circumstances,
which rob the Soul of Peace, and the Body of Rest; not enrag'd with
the Passion of Envy, or secret burning Lust of Ambition for great
things; but in easy Circumstances sliding gently through the World, and
sensibly tasting the Sweets of living, without the bitter, feeling that
they are happy, and learning by every Day's Experience to know il
more sensibly.
After this, he pressed me earnestly, and in the most affectionate
manner, not to play the young Man, not to precipitate myself into
Miseries which Nature and the Station of Life I was born in, seemed
to have provided against; that I was under no Necessity of seeking
my Bread; that he would do well for me, and endeavour to enter me
fairly into the Station of Life which he had been just recommending
to me; and that if I was not very easy and happy in the World, it
must be my mere Fate or Fault that must hinder it, and that he
should have nothing to answer for, having thus discharg'd his Duty in
warning me against Measures which he knew would be to my Hurt:
In a word, that as he would do very kind things for me if I would
stay and settle at Home as he directed, so he would not have so
much Hand in my Misfortunes, as to give me any Encouragement to
go away: And to close all, he told me I had my elder Brother for an
Example, to whom he had used the same earnest Persuasions to keep
him from gcing into the Low Country Wars, but could not prevaif,
his young Desires prompting him to run into the Army, where he
was killed; and though he said he would not cease to pray for me, yet
he would venture to say to me, that if I did take this foolish Step,
God would not bless me, and I would have Leisure hereafter to re
fleet upon having neglected his Counsel when there might be none to
assist in my Recovery.
I observed in this last Part of his Discourse, which was truly
Prophetic, though I suppose my Father did not know it to be so
himself; I say, I observed the Tears run down his Face very
plentifully, and especially when he spoke of my Brother who
was killed; and that when he spoke of my having Leisure to repent,
and none to assist me, he was so moved, that he broke off the Dis-
course, and told me, his Heart was so full he could say no more to me.
I was sincerely affected with this Discourse, as indeed who could
be otherwise; and I resolv'd not to think of going abroad any more,
but to settle at home according to my Father's Desire. But alas! a
few Days wore it all off; and in short, to prevent any of my Father's
farther Importunities, in a few Weeks after, I resolv'd to run quite
away from him. However, I did not act so hastily neither as my
first Heat of ResokVion prompted, but I took my Mother, at a time
when I thought her a little pleasanter than ordinary, and told her,
that my Thoughts v ere so entirely bent upon seeing the World, that
I should never settle to anything with Resolution enough to go
through with it, and my Father had better give me his Consent than
force me to go without it; that I was now Eighteen Years old, which
was too late to go Apprentice to a Trade, or Clerk to an Attorney;
that I was sure if I did, I should never serve out my time, and I
should certainly run away from my Master before my Time was out,
and go to Sea; and if she would speak to my Father to let me go
but one Voyage abroad, if I came home again and did not like it,
I would go no more, and I would promise by a double Dili-
gence to recover that Time I had lost
This put my Mother into a great Passion: She told me, she knew
it would be to no Purpose to speak to my Father upon any such
Subject; that he knew too well what was my Interest to give his
Consent to anything so much for my Hurt, and that she wondered
how I could think of any such thing after such a Discourse as I had
had with my Father, and such kind and tender Expressions as she
knew my Father had used to me; and that, in short, if I would ruin
myself there was no Help for me; but I might depend I should
never have their Consent to it: That for her Part she would not have
so much Hand in my Destruction; and I should never have it to say,
that my Mother was willing when my Father was not
Though my Mother refused to move it to my Father, yet, as I have
heard afterwards, she reported all the Discourse to him, and that my
Father, after showing a great Concern at it, said to her with a Sigh,
That Boy might be happy if he would stay at home, but if he goec
abroad he will be the miserablest Wretch that was ever born: I can
give no Consent to it
It was not till almost a Year after this that I broke loose, though in
the mean time I continued obstinately deaf to all Proposals of
settling to Business, and frequently expostulating with my Father and
Mother, about their being so positively determin'd against what they

knew my Inclinations prompted me to. But being one Day at Hull,
where I went casually, and without any Purpose of making an Elope-
ment that time; but I say, being there, and one of my Companions
being going by Sea to London, in his Father's Ship, and prompting
me to go with them, with the common Allurement of Seafaring Men,
viz. That it should cost me nothing for my Passage, I consulted
neither Father or Mother any more, nor so much as sent them Word
of it; but leaving them to hear of it as they might, without asking
God's Blessing, or my Father's, without any Consideration of Circum-
stances or Consequences, and in an ill Hour, God knows. On the
first of September 16 5 i, I went on Board a Ship bound for London:
never any young Adventurer's Misfortunes, I believe, began sooner,
or continued longer than mine. The Ship was no sooner gotten out
of the Humber, but the Wind began to blow, and the Waves to rise
in a most frightful manner; and as I had never been at Sea before, I
was most inexpressibly sick in Body, and terrified in my Mind: I
began now seriously to reflect upon what I had done, and how justly
I was overtaken by the Judgment of Heaven for my wicked leaving
my Father's House, and abandoning my Duty; all the good Counsel
of my Parents, my Father's Tears and my Mother's Entreaties came
now fresh into my Mind, and my Conscience, which was not yel
come to the Pitch of Hardness to which it has been since, reproach'd
me with the Contempt of Advice, and the Breach of my Duty to God
and my Father.
All this while the Storm increas'd, and the Sea, which I had never
been upon before, went very high, though nothing like what I have seen
many times since; no, nor like what I saw a few Days after: But it
was enough to affect me then, who was but a young Sailor, and had
never known anything of the matter. I expected every Wave would
have swallowed us up, and that every time the Ship fell down, as 1
thought, in the Trough or Hollow of the Sea, we should never rise
more; and in this Agony of Mind, I made many Vows and Resolu-
tions, that if it would please God here to spare my Life this one
Voyage, if ever I got once my Foot upon dry Land again, I would
go directly home to my Father, and never set it into a Ship again
while I lived; that I would take. his Advice, and never run myself
into such Miseries as these any more. Now I saw plainly the Good-
ness of his Observations about the middle Station of Life, how easy,
how comfortably he had lived all his Days, and never had been ex-
pos'd to Tempests at Sea, or Troubles on Shore; and I resolv'd that
I would, like a true repenting Prodigal, go home to my Father.
These wise and sober Thoughts continued all the while the Storm
continued, and indeed some time after; but the next Day the Wind
was abated and the Sea calmer, and I began to be a little inur'd to
it: However I was very grave for all that Day, being also a little Sea
sick still; but towards Night the Weather cleared up, the Wind was
quite over, and a charming fine Evening follow'd; the Sun went down
perfectly clear and rose so the next Morning; and having little or no
Wind, and a smooth Sea, the Sun shining upon it, the Sight was, as I
thought, the most delightful that ever I saw.
I had slept well in the Night, and was now no more Sea sick but
very cheerful, looking with Wonder upon the Sea that was so rough
and terrible the Day before, and could be so calm and so pleasant in
jo little time after. And now lest my good Resolutions should con-
tinue, my Companion, who had indeed entic'd me away, comes to me,
Well Bob, says he, clapping me on the Shoulder, How do you do after
ti? I warrant you were frighted, wa'n't you, last N'ght, when it blew
but a Capfull of Wind? A Capfull do you call'it? said I, 'twas a
terrible Storm: A Storm, you Fool you, replies he, do you call that a
Storm J why it was nothing at all; give us but a good Ship and Sea
Room, and we think nothing of such a Squall of Wind as that; but you're
but a fresh-water Sailor, Bob; come let us make a Bowl of Punch and
we'll forget all that, d'ye see what charming Weather 'tis now. To
make short this sad Part of my Story, we went the old way of all
Sailors, the Punch was made, and I was made drunk with it, «.nd in
that one Night's Wickedness I drowned all my Repentance, all my
Reflections upon my past Conduct, and all my Resolutions for my
future. In a word, as the Sea was returned to its Smoothness of
Surface and settled Calmness by the Abatement of that Storm, so the
Hurry of my Thoughts being over, my Fears and Apprehensions of
being swallow'd up by the Sea being forgotten, and the Current of
my former Desires return'd, I entirely forgot the Vows and Promises
that I made in my Distress. I found indeed some Intervals of Re-
flection, and the serious Thoughts did, as it were endeavour to return
again sometimes, but I shook them off, and roused myself from them
as it were from a Distemper, and applying myself to Drink and
Company, soon mastered the Return of those Fits, for so I called
them, and I had in five or six Days got as complete a Victory over
Conscience as any young Fellow that resolv'd not to be troubled with
it, could desire: But I was to have another Trial for it still; and
Providence, as in such Cases generally it does, resolv'd to leave me
entirely without Excuse. For if I would not take this for a Delive-
rance, the next was to be such a one as the worst and most harden'd
Wretch among us would confess both the Danger and the Mercy.
The sixth Day of our being at Sea we came into Yarmouth Roads;
the Wind having been contrary, and the Weather calm, we had made
bet little Wa'j since the Storm. Here we were obliged to come to an
Anchor, and here we lay, the Wind continuing contrary, viz. at South-
west, for seven or eight Days, during which time a great many Ships
from Newcastle came into the same Roads, as the common Harbour
where the Ships might wait for a Wind for the River.
We had not however rid here so long, but should have Tided it up
the River, but that the Wind blew too fresh; and after we had lain
four or five Days, blew very hard. However, the Roads being
reckoned as good as a Harbour, the Anchorage good, and our Ground-
Tackle very strong, our Men were unconcerned, and not in the least
apprehensive of Danger, but spent the Time in Rest and Mirth, after
the manner of the Sea; but the eighth Day in the Morning, the Wind
increased, and we had all Hands at Work to strike our Topmasts,
and make everything snug and close, that the Ship might ride as easy
as possible. By Noon '.he Sea went very high indeed, and our Ship
rid Forecastle in, shipped several Seas, and we thought once or twice
our Anchor had come home ; upon which our Master order'd out the
Sheet Anchor; so that we rode with two Anchors a-Head, and the
Cables veered out to the better End.
By this Time it blew a terrible Storm indeed, and now I began to
see Terror and Amazement in the Faces even of the Seamen them-
selves. The Master, though vigilant to the Business of preserving the
Ship, yet as he went in and out of his Cabin by me, I could hear
him softly to himself say several times, Lord be merciful to us, wc shall
be all lost, we shall be all undone; and the like. During these first
Hurries, I was stupid, lying still in my Cabin, which was in the
Steerage, and cannot describe my Temper: I could ill re-assume the
first Penitence, which I had so apparently trampled upon, and harden'd
myself against: I thought the Bitterness of Death had been past,
and that this would be nothing too like the first But when the
Master himself came by me, as I said just now, and said we should
be all lost, I was dreadfully frighted: I got up out of my Cabin,
and looked out; but such a dismal Sight I never saw: The Sea went
Mountains high, and broke upon us every three or four Minutes:
When I could look about, I could see nothing but Distress round
us: Two Ships that rid near us we found had cut their Masts by the
Board, being deep laden; and our Men cried out, that a Ship which
rid about a Mile a-Head of us was foundered. Two more Ships
being driven from their Anchors, were run out of the Roads to Sea
at all Adventures, and that with not a Mast standing. The light
Ships fared the best, as not so much labouring in the Sea; but two
or three of them drove, and came close by us, running away with only
their Sprit-sail out before the Wind.
Towards Evening the Mate and Boatswain begged the Master of
our Ship to let them cut away the Foremast, which he was very
unwilling to: But the Boatswain protesting to him, that if he did
not, the Ship would founder, he consented; and when they had cut
away the Foremast, the Mainmast stood so loose, and shook the
Ship so much, they were obliged to cut her away also, and make a
clear Deck.
Any one may judge what a Condition I must be in at all this, who
was but a young Sailor, and who had been in such a Fright before at
but a littie. But if I can express at this Distance the Thoughts I
had about me at that time, I was in tenfold more Horror of Mind
upon Account of my former Convictions, and the having returned
from them to the Resolutions I had wickedly taken it first, than I
was at Death itself; and these added to the Terror of the Storm,
put me into such a Condition, that I can by no Words describe k.
But the worst was not come yet, the Storm continued with such
Fury, that the Seamen themselves acknowledged they had never
known a worse. We had a good Ship, but she was deep kden, and
wallowed in the Sea, that the Seamen every now and then cried out,
she would founder. It was my Advantage in one respect, that I did
not know what they meant by Founder, till I inquir'd. However,
the Storm was so violent, that I saw what is not often seen, the
Master, the Boatswain, and some others more sensible than the rest,
at their Prayers, and expecting every Moment when the Ship would
go to the Bottom. In the Middle of the Night, and under all the
rest of our Distresses, one of the Men that had been down on
Purpose to see, cried out we had sprung a Leak; another said there
was four Foot Water in the Hold. Then all Hands were called to the
Pump. At that very Word my Heart, as I thought, died within me,
and I fell backwards upon the Side of my Bed where I sat, into the
Cabin. However, the Men roused me, and told me, that I that was
able to do nothing before, was as well able to pump as another; at which
I stirred up, and went to the Pump and worked very heartily. While
this was doing, the Master seeing some light Colliers, who not able to
ride out the Storm, were oblig'd to slip and run away to Sea, and would
come near us, ordered to fire a Gun as a Signal of Distress. I who
knew nothing what that meant, was so surprised, that I thought the Ship
had broke, or some dreadful thing had happened. In a word, I was
so surprised, that I fell down in a Swoon. As this was a time when
everybody had his own Life to think of, nobody minded me, or
what was become of me; but another Man stepped up to the Pump,
and thrusting me aside with his Foot, let me lie, thinking I had been
dead; and it was a great while before I came to myself.
We worked on, but the Water increasing in the Hold, it was appa-
rent that the Ship would founder, and though the Storm began to abate
a little, yet as it was not possible she could swim till we might run
into a Port, so the Master continued firing Guns for Help; and a
light Ship, who had rid it out just a-Head of us ventured a Boat out
to help us. It was with the utmost Hazard the Boat came near us,
but it was impossible for us to get on Board, or for the Boat to lie
near the Ship Side, till at last the Men rowing very heartily, and ven-
turing their Lives to save ours, our Men cast them a Rope over the
Stern with a Buoy to it, and then veered it out a great Length, which
they after great Labour and Hazard took hold of and we hauled them
close under our Stern, and got all into their Boat It was to no
Purpose for them or us after we were in the Boat to think of reaching
to their own Ship, so all agreed to let her drive and only to pull her in
towards Shore as much as we could, and our Master promised them.
That if the Boat was staved upon Shore he would make it good to
their Master, so partly rowing and partly driving, our Boat went away
to the Norward sloping towards the Shore almost as far as Winter-
ton Ness.
We were not much more than a quarter of an Hour out of our Ship
but we saw her sink, and then I understood for the first time what
was meant by a Ship foundering in the Sea; I must acknowledge 1
had hardly Eyes to look up when the Seamen told me she was sink-
ing; for from that Moment they rather put me into the Boat than
that I might be said to go in, my Heart was as it were dead within
me, partly with Fright, partly with Horror of Mind and the Thoughts
of what was yet before me.
While we were in this Condition, the Men yet labouring at the Oar to
bring the Boat near the Shore, we could see, when our Boat mounting
the Waves, we were able to see the Shore, a great many People run-
ning along the Shore to assist us when we should come near, but we
made but slow way towards the Shore, nor were we able to reach the
Shore, till being past the Lighthouse at Winterton, the Shore falls ofl
to the Westward towards Cromer, and so the Land broke off a little
the Violence of the Wind: Here we got in, and though not without
much Difficulty got all safe on Shore and walked afterwards on Foot
to Yarmouth, where, as unfortunate Men, we were used with great
Humanity as well by the Magistrates of the Town, who assign'd us
good Quarters, as by particular Merchants and Owners of Ships, and
had Money given us sufficient to carry us either to London or back tc
Hull, as we thought fit
Had I now had the Sense to have gone back to Hull, and have
gone home, I had been happy, and my Father, an Emblem of our
Blessed Saviour's Parable, had even killed the fatted Calf for me; for
hearing the Ship I went away in was cast away in Yarmouth Road, it
was a great while before he had any Assurance that I was not drowned.
But my ill Fate pushed me on now with an Obstinacy that nothing
could resist; and though I had several times loud Calls from my Reason
and my more composed Judgment to go home, yet I had no Power to
do it 1 know not what to call this, nor will I urge, that it is a secret
over-ruling Decree that hurries us on to be the Instruments of our
own Destruction, even though it be before us, and that we rush upon it
with our Eyes open. Certainly nothing but some such decreed una-
voidable Misery attending, and which it was impossible for me to
escape, could have pushed roe forward against the calm Reasonings
and Persuasions of my most retired Thoughts, and against two such
visible Instructions as I had met with in my first Attempt
My Comrade, who had helped to harden me before, and who was
the Master's Son, was now less forward than I; the first time he
spoke to me after we were at Yarmouth, which was not till two or
three Days, for we were separated in the Town to several Quarters;
I say, the first time he saw me, it appear'd his Tone was altef'd,
and looking very melancholy and shaking his Head, asked me how I
did, and telling his Father who I was, and how I had come this
Voyage only for a Trial in order to go farther abroad; his Father
turning to me with a very grave and concern'd Tone, Young Man,
says he, you ought never to go to Sea any more, you ought to take this
for a plain and visible Token that you are not to be a Seafaring Man,
why Sir, said I, will you go to Sea no more? That is another Case,
said fee 3 it is my Calling, and therefore my Duty; but as you made
this Voyage for a Trial, you see what a Taste Heaven has given
you of what you are to expect if you persist; perhaps this is all befallen
us on your Account, like Jonah in the ship of Taxsbish. Pray, continues
he, what are you? and on what Account did you go to Sea? Upon
that I told him some of my Story; at the End of which he burst out
with a strange kind of Passion, What had I done, says he, that such
an unhappy Wretch should come into my Ship? I would not set my
Foot in the same Ship with thee again for a Thousand Pbunds.
This indeed was, as I said, an Excursion of his Spirits which were
yet agitated by the Sense of his Loss, and was farther than he could
have Authority to go. However he afterwards talked very gravely to
me, exhorted me to go back to my Father, and not tempt Provi-
dence to my Ruin; told me I might see a visible Hand of Heaven
against me, And young Man, said he, depend upon it, if you do not go
back, wherez'er you go, you will meet with nothing but Disasters and
Disappointments, till your Fat'her's Words are fulfilled upon you.
We parted soon after; for I made him little Answer, and I saw
him no more; which way he went, I know not As for me, having
some Money in my Pocket, I travelled to London by Land; and
there, as well as on the Road, had many Struggles with myself, what
Course of Life I should take, and whether I should go Home, or go
to Sea.
As to going Home, Shame opposed the best Motions that offered
to my Thoughts; and it immediately occurr'd to me how I should be
laughed at among the Neighbours, and should be asham'd to see, not
my Father and Mother only, but even everybody else; from whence
I have since often observed, how incongruous and irrational the com-
mon Temper of Mankind is, especially of Youth, to that Reason
which ought to guide them in such Cases, viz. That they are not
asham'd to sin, and yet are asham'd to repent; not asham'd of the
Action for which they ought justly to be esteemed Fools, but are
asham'd of the returning, which only can make them be esteem'd
wise Men.
In this State of Life however I remained some time, uncertain
what Measures to take, and what Course of Life to lead. An irresis-
tible Reluctance continu'd to going Home; and as I stayed a while,
the Remembrance of the Distress I had been in wore off; and aa
that abated, the little Motion I had in my Desires to a Return wore
off with it, till at last I quite laid aside the Thoughts of it, and looked
out for a Voyage.
That evil Influence which carried me first away from my Father's
House, that hurried me into the wild and indigested Notion of raising
my Fortune; and that impress'd those Conceits so forcibly upon me,
as to make me deaf to all good Advice, and to the Entreaties and
even Command of my Father: I say the same Influence, whatever
it was, presented the most unfortunate of all Enterprises to my View;
and I went on board a Vessel bound to the Coast of Africa; or, as
our Sailors vulgarly call it, a Voyage to Guinea.
It was my great Misfortune that in all these Adventures I did not
ship myself as a Sailor; whereby, though I might indeed have worked a
little harder than ordinary, yet at the same time I had learned the
Duty and Office of a Foremast Man; and in time might have
qualified myself for a Mate or Lieutenant, if not for a Master: But
as it was always my Fate to choose for the worst, so I did here; for
having Money in my Pocket, and good Clothes upon my Back, I
would always go on board in the Habit of a Gentleman; and so I
neither had any Business in the Ship, or learned to do any.
It was my Lot first of all to fall into pretty good Company in
London, which does not always happen to such loose and unguided
young Fellows as I then was; the Devil generally not omitting to lay
some Snare for them very early: But it was not so with me, I first
fell acquainted with the Master of a Ship who had been on the Coas;
of Guinea; and who having had very good Success there, was re
solved to go again; and who taking a Fancy to my Conversatior ,
which was not at all disagreeable at that time, hearing me say I ha.i
a mind to see the World, told me if I would go the Voyage with him
I should be at no Expense; I should be his Messmate and his Com-
panion, and if I could carry anything with me, I should have all the
Advantage of it that the Trade would admit; and perhaps I might
meet with some Encouragement
I embrac'd the Offer, and entering into a strict Friendship with
this Captain, who was an honest and plain-dealing Man, I went the
Voyage with him, and carried a small Adventure with me, which by
the disinterested Honesty of my Friend the Captain, I increased very
considerably; for I carried about 40/. in such Toys and Trifles as
the Captain directed me to buy. This 40/. I had mustered together
by the Assistance of some of my Relations whom I corresponded
with, and who, I believe, got my Father, or at least my Mother, to
contribute so much as that to my first Adventure.
This was the only Voyage, which I may say was successful in all
my Adventures, and which I owe to the Integrity and Honesty of my
Friend the Captain, under whom also I got a competent Knowledge
of the Mathematics and the Rules of Navigation, learned how to keep
an Account of the Ship's Course, take an Observation; and in short,
to understand some things that were needful to be understood by a
Sailor: For, as he took Delight to introduce me, I took Delight to
learn; and, in a word, this Voyage made me both a Sailor and a
Merchant: for I brought home 5 Pounds 9 Ounces of Gold Dust for my
Adventure, which yielded me in London at my Return, almost 300/.
and this filled me with those aspiring Thoughts which have since so
completed my Ruin.
Yet even in this Voyage I had my Misfortunes too; particularly,
that I was continually sick, being thrown into a violent Calenture by the
excessive Heat of the Climate; our principal Trading being upon the
Coast, from the Latitude of 15 Degrees North even to the Line itself.
I was now set up for a Guinea Trader; and my Friend, to my
great Misfortune, dying soon after his Arrival, I resolved to go the
same Voyage again, and I embark'd in the same Vessel with one who
was his Mate in the former Voyage, and had now got the Command
of the Ship. This was the unhappiest Voyage that ever Man made;
for though I did not carry quite 100/. of my new gained Wealth, so that
I had 200 left, and which I lodged with my Friend's Widow, who was
very just to me, yet I fell into terrible Misfortunes in this Voyage;
and the first was this, viz. Our Ship making her Course towards the
Canary Islands, or rather between those Islands and the African
Shore, was surprised in the Grey of the Morning, by a Turkish Rover
of Sallee, who gave Chase to us with all the Sail she could make. We
crowded also as much Canvas as our Yards would spread, .or our
Masts carry, to have got clear; but finding the Pirate gained upon us,
and would certainly come up with us in a few Hours, we prepared to
fight; our Ship having 1 a Guns, and the Rogue 18. About three in
the Afternoon he came up with us, and bringing to by Mistake, just
athwart our Quarter, instead of athwart our Stern, as he intended, we
brought 8 of our Guns to bear on that Side, and poured in a Broadside
upon him, which made him sheer off again, after returning our Fire,
and pouring in also his small Shot from near 200 Men which he had
on Board. However, we had not a Man touched, all our Men keeping
close. He prepar'd to attack us again, »v\ we tf> defend ourselves;
but laying us on Board the next time upon our ether Quarter, he
entered 60 Men upon our Decks, who immediately fell to cutting and
hacking the Decks and Rigging. We plied them with Small-shot,
Half-Pikes, Powder-Chests, and such like, and cleared our Deck of
them twice. However, to cut short this melancholy Part of our
Story, our Ship being disabled, and three of our Men killed, and eight
wounded, we were obliged to yield, and were carried all Prisoners
into Sallee, a Port belonging to the Moors.
The Usage I had there was not so dreadful as at first I apprehended,
nor was I carried up the Country to the Emperor's Court, as the rest
of our Men were, but was kept by the Captain of the Rover, as his
proper Prize, and made his Slave, being young and nimble, and fit for
his Business. At this surprising Change of my Circumstances from a
Merchant to a miserable Slave, I was perfectly overwhelmed; and
now I looked back upon my Father's prophetic Discourse to me, that
I should be miserable, and have none to relieve me, which I thought
was now so effectually brought to pass, that it could not be worse;
that now the Hand of Heaven had overtaken me, and I was undone
without Redemption. But alas! this was but a Taste of the Misery
I was to go through, as will appear in the Sequel of this Story.
As my new Patron or Master had taken me Home to his House, so
I was in hopes that he would take me with him when he went to Sea
again, believing that it would some time or other be his Fate to be
taken by a Spanish or Portugal Man of War; and that then I should
be set at Liberty. But this Hope of mine was soon taken away; for
when he went to Sea, he left me on Shore to look after his little Gar-
den, and do the common Drudgery of Slaves about his House; and
when he came home again from his Cruise, he order'd me to lie in the
Cabin to look after the Ship.
Here I meditated nothing but my Escape; and what Method I
might take to effect it, but found no Way that had the least Probabi-
lity in it: Nothing presented to make the Supposition of it rational;
for I had nobody to communicate it to, that would embark with me;
no Fellow-Slave, no Englishman, Irishman, or Scotsman there but my-
self; so that for two Years, though I often pleased myself with the Im-
agination, yet I never had the least encouraging Prospect of putting
it in Practice.
After about two Years an odd Circumstance presented itself, which
pnt the old Thought of making some Attempt for my Liberty, again
in my Head: My Patron lying at Home longer than usual, without
fitting out his Ship, which, as I heard, was for want of Money; he
used constantly, once or twice a Week, sometimes oftener, if the
Weather was fair, to take the Ship's Pinnace, and go out into the
Road a fishing; and as he always took me and a young Maresco
with him to row the Boat, we made him very merry, and I proved very
dexterous in catching Fish; insomuch that sometimes he would sen?
me with a Moor, one of his Kinsmen, and the Youth the Maresco, a
they called him, to catch a Dish of Fish for him.
It happen'd one time, that going a fishing in a stark calm Mor
n
ing, a Fog rose so thick, that though we were not half a League from the
Shore we lost Sight of it; and rowing we knew not whither or which
way, we labour'd all Day and all the next Night, and when the Morn-
ing came we found we had pulled off to Sea instead of pulling in for
the Shore; and that we were at least two Leagues from the Shore:
However we got well in again, though with a great deal of Labour, and
some Danger; for the Wind began to blow pretty fresh in the Morn-
ing; but particularly we were all very hungry.
But our Patron warned by this Disaster, resolved to take more
Care of himself for the future; and having lying by him the Long-
boat of our English Ship »ve had taken, he resolved he would not
go a fishing any more without a Compass and some Provision; so
he order'd the Carpenter of his Ship, who also was an English Slave,
to build a little State-room or Cabin in the middle of the Long Boat,
like that of a Barge, with a Place to stand behind it to steer and
hale home the Main-sheet; and Room before for a hand or two to
stand and work the Sails; she sailed with that we call a Shoulder of
Mutton Sail; and the Boom gibbed over the Top of the Cabin, which
lay very snug and low, and had in it Room for him to lie, with a
Slave or two, and a Table to eat on, with some small Lockers to put
in some Bottles of such Liquor as he thought fit to drink in; particu-
larly his Bread, Rice and Coffee.
We went frequently out with this Boat a fishing, and as I was
most dexterous to catch fish for him, he never went without me: It
happen'd that he had appointed to go out in this Boat, either for
Pleasure or for Fish, with two or three Moors of some Distinction in
that Place, and for whom he had provided extraordinarily; and had
therefore sent on board the Boat over Night, a larger Store of Provv
sions than ordinary; and had order'd me to get ready three Fuzees
with Powder and Shot, which were on board his Ship; for that they
design'd some Sport of Fowling as well as Fishing.
I got all things ready as he had directed, and waited the next
Morning with the Boat, washed clean, her Ancient and Pendants
out, and everything to accommodate his Guests; when by and by my
Patron came on board alone, and told me his Guests had put off
going, upon some Business that fell out, and order'd me with the
Man and Boy, as usual, to go out with the Boat and catch them some
Fish, for that his Friends were to sup at his House; and commanded
that as soon as I had got some Fish I should bring it home to his
House; all which I prepar'd to do.
This Moment my former Notions of Deliverance darted into my
Thoughts, for now I found I was like to have a little Ship at my
Command; and my Master being gone, I prepar'd to furnish my-
self, not for a fishing Business, but for a Voyage; though I knew not,
neither did I so much as consider whither I should steer; for any-
where to get out of that Place was my Way.
My first Contrivance was to make a Pretence to speak to this
Moor, to get something for our Subsistence on board; for I told him
we must not presume to eat of our Patron's Bread, he said, that
was true; so he brought a large Basket of Rusk or Biscuit of their
kind, and three Jars with fresh Water into the Boat; I knew where
my Patron's Case of Bottles stood, which it was evident by the
make were taken out of some English Prize; and I convey'd them
into the Boat while the Moor was on Shore, as if they had been there
before, for our Master: I convey'd also a great Lump of Bees-Wax
into the Boat, which weighed above half a Hundred Weight, with a
Parcel of Twine or Thread, a Hatchet, a Saw and a Hammer, all
which were of great Use to us afterwards; especially the Wax to
make Candles. Another Trick I tried upon him, which he inno-
cently came into also; his Name was Ismael, who they call Muly, or
Moely, so I called to him, Moely said I, our Patron's Guns are on
board the Boat, can you not get a little Powder and Shot, it may be
we may kill some Akamies (a Fowl like our Curlews) for ourselves,
for I know he keeps the Gunner's Stores in the Ship? Yes, says he,
HI bring some, and accordingly he brought a great Leather Pouch
which held about a Pound and half of Powder, or rather more;
*nd another with Shot, that had five or six Pound, with some Bullett -
and put all into the Boat: At the same time I had found some
Powder of my Master's in the Great Cabin, with which I filled one
of the large Bottles in the Case, which was almost empty; pouring
what was in it into another: and thus furnished with everything
needful, we sailed out of the Port to fish: The Castle which is at the
Entrance of the Port knew who we were, and took no Notice of us;
and we were not above a Mile out of the Port before we hauled in our
Sail, and set us down to fish: The Wind blew from the N.N.E.
which was contrary to my Desire; for had it blown southerly I had been
sure to have made the Coast of Spain, and at least reached to the Bay of
Cadiz; but my Resolutions were, blow which way it would, I would
be gone from that horrid Place where I was, and leave the rest to Fate.
After we had fished some time and catched nothing, for when I had
Fish on my Hook, I would not pull them up, that he might not see
them; I said to the Moor, this will not do, our Master will not be
thus served, we must stand farther off: He thinking no harm, agreed;
and being in the head of the Boat set the Sails; and as I had the
Helm I run the Boat out near a League farther, and then brought her
to as if I would fish; when giving the Boy the Helm, I stepped
forward to where the Moor was, and making as if I stooped for some-
thing behind him, I took him by Surprize with my Arm under his
Twist, and tossed him clear overboard into the Sea; he rose im-
mediately, for he swam like a Cork, and called to me, begged to be
taken in, told me he would go all over the World with me; he swam
so strong after the Boat that he would have reached me very quickly,
there being but little Wind; upon which I stepped into the Cabin, and
fetching one of the Fowling-pieces, I presented it at him, and told
him, I had done him no hurt, and if he would be quiet I would do
him none; but said I, you swim well enough to reach to the Shore, and
the Sea is calm, make the best of your Way to Shore and I will do
you no harm, but if you come near the Boat I'll shoot you through'
the Head; for I am resolved to have my Liberty; so he turned
himself about and swam for the Shore, and I make no doubt but he
reached it with Ease, for he was an Excellent Swimmer.
I could have been content to have taken this Moor with me, and
have drowned the Boy, but there was no venturing to trust him:
When he was gone I turned to the Boy, who they called Xury, and
said to him, Xury, if you will be faithful to me I'll make you a great
Man, but if you will not stroke your Face to be true to me, that is,
wear by Mahomet and his Father's Beard, I must throw you into the
Sea; the Boy smiled in my Face, and spoke so innocently that 1
could not mistrust him; and swore to be faithful to me, and go all
over the World with me.
While I was in View of the Moor that was swimming, I stood out
directly to Sea with the Boat, rather stretching to Windward, that
they might think me gone towards the Straits-mouth (as indeed
any one that had been in their Wits must have been suppos'd to do)
for who would have suppos'd we were sailed on to the southward to
the truly Barbarian Coast, where whole Nations of Negroes were
sure to surround us with their Canoes, and destroy us; where we
could never once go on Shore but we should be devour'd by savage
Beasts, or more merciless Savages of human kind.
But as soon as it grew dusk in the Evening, I changed my Course,
and steered directly South and by East, bending my Course a little
toward the East, that I might keep in with the Shore; and having a
fair fresh Gale of Wind, and a smooth quiet Sea, I made such Sail
that I believe by the next Day at Three o'Clock in the Afternoon,
wher. I frst made the Land, I could not be less than 150 Miles
South of Sallee; quite beyond the Emperor of Morocco's Dominions,
or indeed of any other King thereabouts, for we saw no People.
Yet such was the Fright I had taken at the Moors, and the dreadful
Apprehensions I had of falling into their Hands, that I would not
stop, or go en Shore, or come to an Anchor; the Wind continuing
fair, until I had sailed in that manner five Days: And then the Wind
shifting to the southward, I concluded also that if any of our Vessels
'sere in Chase of me, they also would now give over; so I ventur'd to
make to *he Coast, and came to an Anchor in the Mouth of a little
River, I knew not what, or where; neither what Latitude, what
Country, what Nations, or what River: I neither saw, or desir'd to see
any People, the principal thing I wanted was fresh Water: We came
into this Creek in the Evening, resolving to swim on Shore as soon as
it was dark, zxA discover the Country; but as soon as it was quite
dark, we heard such dreadful Noises of the Barking, Roaring, and
Howling of Wild Creatures, of we knew not what Kinds, that the poor
Boy was ready to die with Fear, and begged of me not to go on Shore
till Day; well Xury, said I, then I wont, but it may be we may see
Men by Day, who will be as bad to us as those Lions; then we givi
them the shoot Gun, says Xury, laughing, make them run wey; such
English Xury spoke by conversing among as Slaves, however I was
glad to see the Boy so cheerful, and I gave him a Dram (out of oui
Patron's Case of Bottles) to cheer him up: After all, Xury's Advice
was good, and I took it, we dropped our little Anchor and lay still all
Night; I say still., for we slept none! for in two or three Hours we
saw vast great Creatures (we knew not what to call them) of many
torts, come down to the Sea-shore and run into the Water, wallowing
and washing themselves for the Pleasure of cooling themselves) and
they made such hideous Howiings and Yellings, that I never indeed
heard the like.
Xury was dreadfully frighted, and indeed so was I too; but we
were both more frighted when we heard one of these mighty Creatures
come swimming towards our Boat, we could not see him, but we
might hear him by his blowing to be a monstrous, huge and furious
Beast; Xury said it was a Lion, and it might be so for ought I know;
but poor Xury cried to me to weigh the Anchor and row away; no,
says I, Xury, we can slip our Cable with the Buoy to it and go off to
Sea, they cannot follow us far; I had no sooner said so, but I per-
ceiv'd the Creature (whatever it was) within Two Oars' Length, which
something surprized me; however I immediately stepped to the Cabin-
door, and taking up my Gun fired at him, upon which he immediately
turned about and swam towards the Shore again.
But it is impossible to desrribe the horrible Noises, and hideous
Cries and Howiings, that were raised as well upon the Edge of the
Shore, as higher within the Country; upon the Noise or Report of the
Gun, a Thing I have some Reason to believe those Creatures had
never heard before: This Convinc'd me that there was no going on
Shore for us in the Night upon that Coast, and how to venture on
Shore in the Day was another Question too; for to have fallen into
the Hands of any of the Savages, had been as bad as to have fallen
into the Hands of Lions and Tigers; at least we were equally appre-
hensive of the Danger of it
Be that as it would, we were oblig'd to go on Shore somewhere or
other for Water, for we had not a Pint left in the Boat; when or
where to get to it was the Point: Xury said, if I would let him go on
Shore with one of the Jars, he would find if there was any Water and
bring some to me. I asked him why he would go? Why I should not
go and he stay in the* Boat? The Boy answer'd with so much Affection
that made me love him ever after. Says he, If wild Mans come, they
•at me, you go wey. Well, Xury, said I, we will both go, and if the
11
wild Mans come, we will kill them, they shall Eat neither of us; so 1
gave Xury a piece of Rusk-bread to Eat, and a Drum out of oui
Patron's Case of Bottles which I mentioned before; and we hauled
the Boat in as near the Shore as we thought was proper, and so
waded on Shore, carrying nothing but our Arms and two Jars for
Water.
I did not care to go out of Sight of the Boat, fearing the coming of
Canoes with Savages down the River; but the Boy seeing a low Place
about a Mile up the Country rambled to it; and by and by I saw
him come running towards me, I thought he was pursued by some
Savage, or frighted with some wild Beast, and I run forward to-
wards him to help him, but when I came nearer to him, I saw some-
thing hanging over his Shoulders which was a Creature that he had
shot, like a Hare but different in Colour, and longer Legs, however

we were very glad of it, and it was very good Meat; but the great
Joy that poor Xury came with, was to tell me he had found good
Water and seen no wild Mans.
But we found afterwards that we need not take such Pains for
Water, for a little higher up the Creek where we were, we found the
Water fresh when the tide was out, which flowed but a little way up;
so we filled our Jars and feasted on the Hare we had killed, and
prepared to go on our Way, having seen no Footsteps of any human
Creature in that part of the Country.
As I had been one Voyage to this Coast before, I knew very well
that the Islands of the Canaries, and the Cape de Verd Islands also,
lay not far off from the coast But as I had no Instruments to take
an Observation to know what Latitude we were in, and did not
exactly know, or at least remember what Latitude they were in; I
knew not where to look for them, or when to stand off to Sea to-
wards them; otherwise I might now easily have found some of these
Islands. But my hope was, that if I stood along this Coast till I
came to that Part where the English Traded, I should find some of
their Vessels upon their usual Design of Trade, that would relieve
and take us in.
By the best of my Calculation, that Place where I now was, must
be that Country, which lying between the Emperor of Morocco's Do-
minions and the Negroes, lies waste and uninhabited, except by wild
Beasts; the Negroes having abandon'd it and gone farther South for
fear of the Moors; and the Moors not thinking it worth inhabiting,
by reason of its Barrenness; and indeed both forsaking it because of
the prodigious Numbers of Tigers, Lions, Leopards and other
furious Creatures which harbour there; so that the Moors use it for
their Hunting only, where they go like an Army, two or three thousand
Men at a time; and indeed for near an hundred Miles together, upon
this Coast, we saw nothing but a waste uninhabited Country, by Day;
and heard nothing but Howlings and Roaring of wild Beasts, by
Night
Once or twice in the Daytime, I thought I saw the Pico of Tcne-
riffe, being the high top of the Mountain Teneriffe in the Canaries;
and had a great mind to venture out in hopes of reaching thither;
but having tried twice I was forced in again by contrary Winds, the
Sea also going too high for my little Vessel, so I resolved to pursue
my first Design and keep along the Shore.
Several times I was obliged to land for fresh Water, after we had
left this Place; and once in particular, being early in the Morning,
we came to an Anchor under a little Point of Land which was pretty
high, and the Tide beginning to flow, we lay still to go farther in;
Xury, whose Eyes were more about him than it seems mine were,
calls softly to me, and tells me that we had best go farther off the
Shore; for, says he, look yonder lies a dreadful Monster on the side
of that Hillock fast asleep: I looked where he pointed, and saw a
dreadful Monster indeed, for it was a terrible great Lion that lay on
the Side of the Shore, under the Shade of a Piece of the Hill tliat
hung as it were a little over him. Xury, says I, you shall go on
Shore and kill him; Xltry looked frighted, and said, Me kill I he
tat me at one Mouth; one Mouthful he meant; however, I said no
more to the Boy, but bad him lie still, and I took our biggest Gun,
which was almost Musket-bore, and loaded it with a good Charge
of Powder, and with two Slugs; and laid it down; then I loaded
another Gun with two Bullets, and the third, for we had three Pieces,
I loaded with five smaller Bullets. I took the best aim I could with
the first Piece to have shot him into the Head, but he lay so with his
Leg raised a little above his Nose, that the Slugs hit his Leg about
the.Knee, and broke the Bone. He started up growling at first, but
finding his Leg broke fell down again, and then got up upon thiee
Legs and gave the most hideous Roar that ever I heard; I was a
little surpriz'd that I had not hit him on the Head; however I too)
up the second Piece immediately, and though he began to move off fired
again, and shot him into the Head, and had the Pleasure to see him
drop, and make but little Noise, but lay struggling for Life. Then
Xury took Hea±t, and would have me let him go on Shore: Well,
go said I, so the Boy jumped into the Water, and taking a little Gun
in one Hand, swam to Shore with the other Hand, and coming close
to the Creature, put the Muzzle of the Piece to his Ear, and shot
him into the head again, which despatch'd him quite.
This was Game indeed to us, but this was no Food, and I was very
sorry to lose three Charges of Powder and Shot upon a Creature that
was good for nothing to us. However Xury said he would have some
of him; so he comes on board, and asked me to give him the Hat-
chet; for what, Xury, said I? Me cut ojff his Head, said he. How-
ever Xury could not cut off his Head, but he cut off a Foot and
brought it with him, and it was a monstrous great one.
I bethought myself however, that perhaps the Skin of him might
i ne way or other be of some Value to us; and I resolved to take ofl
liis Skin if I could. So Xury and I went to work with him, but Xury
was much the better Workman at it, for I knew very ill how to
do it Indeed it took us up both the whole Day, but at last we got
off the Hide of him, and spreading it on the top of our Cabin, the
Sun effectually dried it in two Days' time, and it afterwards served me
to lie upon.
After this Stop we made on to the Southward continually for ten
or twelve Days, living very sparing on our Provisions, wnich began to
abate very much, and going no oftener into the Shore than we were
oblig'd to for fresh Water; my Design in this was to make the River
Gambia or Senegall, that is to say, anywhere about the Cape de Verd,
where I was in hopes to meet with some European Ship, and if I did
u
not, I knew not what Course I had to take, but to seek out for the
Islands, or perish there among the Negroes. I knew that all the Ships
from Europe, which sailed either to the Coast of Guinea, or to Brasil,
or to the East Indies, made this Cape, or those Islands; and in a
word, I put the whole of my Fortune upon this single Point, either
that I must meet with some Ship, or must perish.
When I had pursued this Resolution about ten Days longer, as I have
said, I began to see that the Land was inhabited, and in two or three
Places, as we sailed by, we saw People stand upon the Shore to look
at us, we could also perceive they were quite Black and Stark naked.
I was once inclin'd to have gone on Shore to them ; but Xury was my
better Counsellor, and said tome, no go, no go; however I hauled in
nearer the Shore, that I might talk to them, and I found they ran
along the Shore by me a good way; I obseiVd they had no Weapons
in their Hands, except one who had a long slender Stick, which Xury
said was a Lance, and that they would throw them a great way with
good aim; so I kept at a distance, but talked with them by Signs as
well as I could; and particularly made Signs for something to Eat,
they beckon'd to me to stop my Boat, and that they would fetch me
some Meat; upon this I lower'd the top of my Sail, and lay by, and
two of them run up into the Country, and in less than half an
Hour came back and brought with them two Pieces of dry Flesh and
some Corn, such as is the Produce of their Country, but we neither
knew what the one or the other was; however we were willing to
accept it, but how to come at it was our next Dispute, for I was not
for venturing on Shore to them, and they were as much afraid of us;
but they took a safe way for us all, for they brought it to the Shore
and laid it down, and went and stood a great way off till we fetched
it on Board, and then came close to us again.
We made Signs of Thanks to them, for we had nothing to make
them amends; but an Opportunity offer'd that very Instant to oblige
them wonderfully, for while we were lying by the Shore, came two
mighty Creatures, one pursuing the other, (as we took it) with great
Fury, from the Mountains towards the Sea; whether it was the Male
pursuing the Female, or whether they were in Sport or in Rage, we
could not tell, any more than we could tell whether it was usual or
strange, but I believe it was the latter; because in the first Place,
those ravenous Creatures seldom appear but in the Night; and in
Ae second Place, we found the People terribly frighted, especially
25
the Women. The Man that had the Lance or Dart did not fly
from them, but the rest did; however as the two Creatures ran
directly into the Water, they did not seem to offer to fall upcn any of
the Negroes, but plunged themselves into the Sea and swam about as
if they had come for their Diversion; at last one of them began to
come nearer our Boat than at first I expected, but I lay ready for him,
for I had loaded my Gun with all possible Expedition, and bad Xury
load both the other; as soon as he came fairly within my reach, I
fired, and shot him directly into the Head; immediately he sunk down
into the Water, but rose instantly and plunged up and down as if he
was struggling for Life; and so indeed he was, he immediately made
to the Shore, but between the Wound which was his mortal Hurt,
and the strangling of the Water, he died just before he reached the
Shore.
It is impossible to express the Astonishment of these poor Creatures
at the Noise and the Fire of my Gun; some of them were even ready
to die for Fear, and fell down as Dead with the very Terror. But
when they saw the Creature dead and sunk in the Water, and that I
made Signs to them to come to the Shore; they took Heart and came
to the Shore and began to search for the Creature, I found him by
his Blood staining the Water, and by the help of a Rope which I
slung round him and gave the Negroes to haul, they dragged him on
Shore, and found that it was a most curious Leopard, spotted and
fine to an admirable Degree, and the Negroes held up their Hands
with Admiration to think what it was I had killed him with.
The other Creature frighted with the flash of Fire and the Noise of
the Gun swam on Shore, and ran up directly to the Mountains from
whence they came, nor could I at that Distance know what it was.
I found quickly the Negroes were for eating the Flesh of this Creature,
so I was willing to have them take it as a Favour from me, which
when I made Signs to them that they might take it, they were very
thankful for, immediately they fell to work with him, and though they
had no Knife, yet with a sharpen'd Piece of Wood they took off his
Skin as readily, and much more readily than we could have done with
a Knife; they offer'd me some of the Flesh, which I declined, making
as if I would give it them, but made Signs for the Skin, which they
gave me very freely, and brought me a great deal more of their Pro-
vision, which though I did not understand, yet I accepted; then I made
Signs to them tor some Water, and held out one of my Jars to them,
turning it bottom upward, to show that it was empty, and that I wanted
to have it filled. They called immediately to some of their Friends,
and there came two Women and brought a great Vessel made of
^arth, and burnt as I suppose in the Sun; this they set down for me,
as before, and I sent Xury on Shore with my Jars, and filled them
all three. The Women were as stark Naked as the Men.
I was now furnished with Roots and Corn, such as it was, and
Water, and leaving my friendly Negroes, I made forward for about
eleven Days more without offering to go near the Shore, till I saw the
Land run out a great Length into the Sea, at about the Distance of
four or five Leagues before me, and the Sea being very calm I kept a
large offing to make this Point; at length, doubling the Point at about
two Leagues from the Land, I saw plainly Land on the other Side to
Seaward; then I concluded, as it was most certain indeed, that this
was the Cape de Verd, and those the Islands, call'd from thence Cape
de Verd Islands. However they were at a great Distance, and I could
not well tell what I had best to do, for if I should be taken with a
Fresh of Wind I might neither reach one or other.
In this Dilemma, as I was very pensive, I stepped into the Cabin and
sat me down, Xury having the Helm, when on a sudden, the Boy cried
out, Master, Master, a Ship with a Sail, and the foolish Boy was
frighted out of his Wits, thinking it must needs be some of his
Master's Ships sent to pursue us, when I knew we were gotten far
enough out of their reach. I jumped out of the Cabin, and imme-
diately saw not only the Ship, but what she was, (viz.) that it was a
Portuguese Ship, and as I thought was bound to the Coast of Guinea
for Negroes. But when I observ'd the Course she steered, I was soon
convinc'd they were bound some other way, and did not design to
tome any nearer to the Shore; upon which I stretched out to Sea as
much as I could, resolving to speak with them if possible.
With all the Sail I could make, I found I should not be able to
come in their Way, but that they would be gone by, before I could
make any Signal to them; but after I had crowded to the utmost
Hid began to despair, they it seems saw me by the help of their Per-
spective-Glasses, and that it was some European Boat, which as they
supposed must belong to some Ship that was lost, so they shortened
Sail to let me come up. I was encouraged with this, and as I had my
Patron's Ancient on Board, I made a Waft of it to them for a Signal
of Distress, and fired a Gun, both which they saw, for they told me
they saw the Smoke, though they did not hear the Gun; upon these
Signals they very kindly brought too, and lay by for me, and in about
three Hours' time I came up with them.
They asked me what I was, in Portuguese, and in Spanish, and in
French, but I understood none of them; but at last a Scots Sailor
who was on board, called to me, and I answer'd him, and told him I
was an Englishman, that I had made my escape out of Slavery from
the Moors at Sallee; then they bade me come on board, and very
kindly took me in, and all my Goods.
It was an inexpressible Joy to me, that any one will believe, that I
was thus deliver'd, as I esteem'd it, from such a miserable and almost
hopeless Condition as I was in, and I immediately offered all I had
to the Captain of the Ship, as a Return for my, Deliverance; but he
generously told me, he would take nothing from me, but that all I
had should be deliver'd safe to me when I came to the Brasils, for
says he, / have saved your Life on no other Terms than I would be glad
to be saved myself, and it may one time or other be my Lot to be taken
up in the same Condition; besides, said he, when I carry you to the
Brasils, so great a way from your own Country, if I should take from
you what you have, you will be starved there, and then I only take away
that Life I have given. No, no, Seignor Inglese, says he, Mr. English-
man, I will carry you thither in Charity, and those things will help you to
buy your Subsistence there and your Passage home again.
As he was Charitable in his Proposal, so he was Just in the Perfor-
mance to a tittle, for he ordered the Seamen that none should offer to
touch anything I had; then he took everything into his own Posses-
sion, and gave me back an exact Inventory of them, that I might have
them, even so much as my three Earthen Jars.
As to my Boat it was a very good one, and that he saw, and told
me he would buy it of me for the Ship's Use, and asked me what I
would have for it? I told him he 1 ad been so generous to me in
everything, that I could not offer to make any Price of the Boat, but
led it entirely to him, upon which he told me he would give me a
Note of his Hand to pay me 80 Pieces of Eight for it at Brasil, and
when it came there, if any one offer'd to give more he would make it
up; he offer'd me also 60 Pieces of Eight more for ray Boy Xury,
which I was loth to take, not that I was not willing to let the Cap-
tain have him, but I very loth to sell the poor Boy's Liberty, who
had assisted me so faithfully in procuring my own. However when
I let him know my Reason, he owned it to be just, and offer'd me
this Medium, that he would give the Boy an Obligation to set him
free in ten Years, if he turned Christian; upon this, and Xury saying
he was willing to go to him, I let the Captain have him.
We had a very good Voyage to the Brasils, and arriv'd in the Bay
de Todos los Santos, or All-Saints Bay, in about Twenty-two Days
after. And now I was once more deliver'd from the most miserable
of all Conditions of Life, and what to do next with myself I was now
to consider.
The generous Treatment the Captain gave me, I can never enough
remember; he would take nothing of me for my Passage, gave me
twenty Ducats for the Leopard's Skin, and forty for the Lion's Skin
which I had in my Boat, and caused everything I had in my Ship
to b^ punctually deliver'd me, and what I was willing to sell he
bought, such as the Case of Bottles, two of my Guns, and a Piece of
the Lump of Bees-wax, for I had made Candles of the rest; in a
word, I made about 220 Pieces of Eight of all my Cargo, and with this
Stock I went on Shore in the Brasils.
I had noc been long here, but being recommended to the House of
a good honest Man like himself, who had an Ingeino as they call it;
that is, a Plantation and a Sugar-House. I lived with him some time,
and acquainted myself by that means with the Manner of their
planting and making of Sugar; and seeing how well the Planters
lived, and how they grew rich suddenly, I resolv'd, if I could get
Licence to settle there, I wound turn Planter among them, resolving
in the meantime to find out some Way to get my Money which I
had left in London remitted to me. To this Purpose getting a kind
of a Letter of Naturalization, I purchased as much Land that was
Uncur'd, as my Money would reach, and formed a Plan for my Plan-
tation and Settlement, and such a one as might be suitable to the
Stock which I proposed to myself to receive from England.
I had a Neighbour, a Portuguese of Lisbon, but bor n of English
Parents, whose Name was Wells, and in much such Circumstances as
I was. I call him my Neighbour, because his Plantation lay next to
mine, and we went on very sociably together. My Stock was but low
as well as his; and we rather planted for Food, than anything else,
for about two Years. However, we began to increase, and our Land
began to come into Order; so that the third Year we planted
some Tobacco, and made each of us a large Piece of Ground ready
for planting Canes in the Year to come; but we both wanted Help,
and now I found more than before, I had done wrong in parting
with my Boy Xury.
But alas! for me to do wrong that never did right, was no great
Wonder; I had no Remedy but to go on; I was gotten into an em-
ployment quite remote to my Genius, and directly contrary to the
Life I delighted in, and for which I forsook my Father's House, and
broke through all his good Advice; nay, I was coming into the very
Middle Station, or upper Degree of low Life, which my Father ad-
vised me to before; and which if I resolved to go on with, I might
as well have stayed at Home, and never have fatigu'd myself in the
World as I had done; and I used often to say to myself, I could have
done this as well in England among my Friends, as have gone 5000
Miles off to do it among Strangers and Savages in a Wilderness,
and at such a Distance, as never to hear from any Part of the World
that had the least Knowledge of me.
In this manner I used to look upon my Condition with the utmost
Regret I had nobody to converse with but now and then this
Neighbour; no Work to be done, but by the Labour of my Hands;
and I used to say, I lived just like a Man cast away upon some desolate
Island, that had nobody there but himself. But how just has it been,
and how should all Men reflect, that when they compare their present
Conditions with others that are worse, Heaven may oblige them to
make the Exchange, and be convinc'd of their former Felicity by their
Experience: I say, how just has it been, that the truly solitary Cife
I reflected on in an Island of mere Desolation should be my Lot, who
had so often unjustly compar'd it with the Life which I then led, in
which had I continued, I had in all Probability been exceeding pros-
perous and rich.
I was in some Degree settled in my Measures for carrying on the
Plantation, before my kind Friend the Captain of the Ship that took
me up at Sea, went back; for the Ship remained there in providing
his Loading, and preparing for his Voyage, near three Months, when
telling him what little Stock I had left behind me in London, he gave
me this friendly and sincere Advice, Seignior Inglese, says he; for so he
always called me, if you will give me letters, and a Procuration heie
in Form to me, with Orders to the Person who has your Money in
London, to send your Effects to Lisbon, to such Persons as I shall
direct, and in such Goods as are proper for this Country, I will bring
you the Produce of them, God willing, at my Return; but sri.ce h jman
Affairs are all subject to Changes and Disasters, I would have you
give Orders but for One Hundred Pounds Sterl. which you say is Half
your Stock, and let the Hazard be run for the first; so that if it come
safe, you may order the rest the same Way; and if it miscarry, you
may have the other Half to have Recourse to for your Supply.
This was so wholesome Advice, and looked so friendly, that I could
not but be convinc'd it was the best Course I could take; so I ac-
cordingly prepared Letters to the Gentlewoman with whom I had
left my Money, and a Procuration to the Portuguese Captain, as he
desired.
I wrote the English Captain's Widow a full Account of all my Ad-
ventures, my Slavery, Escape, and how I had met with the Portugal
Captain at Sea, the Humanity of his Behaviour, and in what Condition
I was now in, with all other necessary Directions for my Supply; and
when this honest Captain came to Lisbon, he found means by some of
the English Merchants there, to send over not the Order only, but a
full Account of my Story to a Merchant at London, who represented
it effectually to her; whereupon, she not only delivered the Money,
but out of her own Pocket sent the Portugal Captain a very handsome
Present for his Humanity and Charity to me.
The Merchant in London vesting this Hundred Pounds in English
Goods, such as the Captain had writ for, sent them directly to him at
Lisbon, and he brought them all safe to me to the Brasils, among
which, without my Direction (for I was too young in my Business to
think of them) he had taken Care to have all Sorts of Tools, Iron-
Work, and Utensils necessary for my Plantation, and which were of
great Use to me.
When this Cargo arrived, I thought my Fortunes made, for I was
surprised with Joy of it; and my good Steward the Captain had laid
out the Five Pounds which my Friend had sent him for a Present for
himself, to purchase, and bring me over a Servant under Bond for six
Years' Service, and would not accept of any Consideration, except a
little Tobacco, which I would have him accept, being of my own
Produce.
Neither was this all; but my Goods being all English Manufactures,
such as Cloth, Stuffs, Bays, and things particularly valuable and de-
sirable in the Country, I found means to sell them to a very great
Advantage; so that I might say, I had more than four times the Value
of my first Cargo, and was now infinitely beyond my poor Neighbour,
I mean in the Advancement of my Plantation; for the first thing I
did, I bought me a Negro Slave, and an European Servant also; I
mean another besides that which the Captain brought me from Lisbon.
But as abus'd Prosperity is oftentimes made the very Means of our
greatest Adversity, so was it with me. I went on the next Year with
great Success in my Plantation: I raised fifty great Rolls of Tobacco
on my own Ground, more than I had disposed of for Necessaries
among my Neighbours; and these fifty Rolls being each of above a
: oo Wt. were well cured and laid by against the Return of the Fleet
from Lisbon: and now increasing in Business and in Wealth, my
Head began to be full of Projects and Undertakings beyond my Reach;
such as are indeed often the Ruin of the best Heads in Business.
Had I continued in the Station I was now in, I had room for all
the happy things to have yet befallen me, for which my Father so
earnestly recommended a quiet retired Life, and of which he had so
sensibly describ'd the middle Station of Life to be full of; but other
things attended me, and I was still to be the wilful Agent of all my
own Miseries; and particularly to increase my Fault and double the
Reflections upon myself, which in my future Sorrows I should have
leisure to make; all these Miscarriages were procured by my appa-
rent obstinate adhering to my foolish inclination of wandering abroad
and pursuing that Inclination, in contradiction to the clearest Views
of doing myself good in a fair and plain pursuit of those Prospects
and those measures of Life, which Nature and Providence concurred
to present me with, and to make my Duty.
As I had once done thus in my breaking away from my Parents, so
I could not be content now, but I must go and leave the happy View
I had of being a rich and thriving Man in my new Plantation, only to
pursue a rash and immoderate Desire of rising faster than the Nature
of the Thing admitted; and thus I cast myself down again into the
deepest Gulf of human Misery that ever Man fell into, or perhaps
could be consistent with Life and a State of Health in the World.
To come then by the just Degrees, to the Particulars of this Part
of my Story; you may suppose, that having now lived almost four
Years in the Brasilo, and beginning to thrive and prosper very well
upon my Plantation; I had not only learned the Language, but had
contracted Acquaintance and Friendship among my Fellow-Planters,
as well as among the Merchants at St Salvadore, which was our Port
and that in my Discourses among them, I had frequently given them
an Account of my two Voyages to the Coast of Guinea, the manner
of Trading with the Negroes there, and how easy it was to purchase
upon the Coast, for Trifles, such as Beads, Toys, Knives, Scissars,
Hatchets, bits of Glass, and the like; not only Gold Dust, Guinea
Grains, Elephants' Teeth, &c., but Negroes for the Service of the
Brasils, in great Numbers.
They listened always very attentively to my Discourses on these
Heads, but especially to that Part which related to the buying
Negroes, which was a Trade at that time not only not far entered
into, but as far as it was, had been carried on by the Assientoe, or
Permission of the Kings of Sfain and Portugal, and engross'd in
the Public, so that few Negroes were brought, and those excessive
dear.
It happen'd, being in Company with some Merchants and Planters
of my Acquaintance, and talking of those things very earnestly,
three of them came to me the next Morning, and told me they had
been musing very much upon what I had discoursed with them of,
the last Night, and they came to make a secret Proposal to me; and
after enjoining me Secrecy, they told me, that they had a mind to fit
out a Ship to go to Guinea, that they had all Plantations as well as I,
and were straiten'd for nothing so much as Servants; that as it was
a Trade that could not be carried on, because they could not pub-
licly sell the Negroes when they came home, so they desired to
make but one Voyage, to bring the Negroes on Shore privately, and
divide them among their own Plantations; and in a Word, the Ques-
tion was, whether I would go their Supercargo in the Ship to
manage the Trading Part upon the Coast of Guinea? And they
offer'd me that I should have my equal Share of the Negroes without
providing any Part of the Stock.
This was a fair Proposal it must be confess'd, had it been made
to any one that had not had a Settlement and Plantation of his own
to look after, which was in a fair way of coming to be very consider-
able, and with a good Stock upon it But for me that was thus
entered and established, and had nothing to do but go on as I had
begun for three or four Years more, and to have sent for the othei
hundred Pound from England, and who in that time, and with that
little Addition, could scarce have failed of being worth three or four
thousand Pounds Sterling, and that increasing too; for me to think
33
of such a Voyage, was the most preposterous Thing that ever Man in
such Circumstances could be guilty of.
But I that was born to be my own Destroyer, could no more resist
the Offer than I could restrain my first rambling Designs, when my
Father's good Counsel was lost upon me. In a word, I told them I
would go with all my Heart, if they would undertake to look after my
Plantation in my Absence, and would dispose of it to such as I should
direct if I miscarry'd. This they all engag'd to do, and entered into
Writings or Covenants to do so; and I made a formal Will, disposing
of my Plantation and Effects, in Case of my Death, making the Cap-
tain of the Ship that had saved my Life as before, my universal Heir,
but obliging him to dispose of my Effects as I had directed in my
Will, one half of the Produce being to himself, and the other to be
shipped to England.
In short, I took all possible Caution to preserve my Effects, and
keep up my Plantation; had I used half as much Prudence to have
looked into my own Interest, and have made a Judgment of what I
ought to have done, and not to have done, I had certainly never
gone away from so prosperous an Undertaking, leaving all the probable
Views of a thriving Circumstance, and gone upon a Voyage to Sea,
attended with all its common Hazards; to say nothing of the Reasons
I had to expect particular Misfortunes to myself.
But I was hurried on, and obey'd blindly the Dictates of my Fancy
rather than my Reason; and accordingly the Ship being fitted out,
and the Cargo furnished, and all things done as by Agreement, by
my Partners in the Voyage, I went on Board in an evil Hour, the
First of September 1659, being the same Day eight Year that I went
from my Father and Mother at Hull, in order to act the Rebel to
their Authority, and the Fool to my own Interest
Our Ship was about iao Ton Burthen, carried 6 Guns, and 14 Men,
besides the Master, his Boy, and myself; we had on board no large
Cargo of Goods, except of such Toys as were fit for our Trade
with the Negroes, such as Beads, bits of Glass, Shells, and odd Trifles,
especially little Looking-Glasses, Knives, Scissars, Hatchets, and the
like.
The same Day I went on board we set sail, standing away to the
Northward upon our own Coast, with Design to stretch over for the
African Coast, when they came about 10 or 12 Degrees of Norther*
Latitude, which it seems was the manner of their Course in those Days.
We had very good Weather, only excessive hot, all the way upon out
own Coast, till we came to the Height of Cape St Augustino, from
whence keeping farther off at Sea we lost Sight of Land, and steered
as if we were bound for the . Isle Fernand de 'Noronha, holding our
Course N.E. by N. and leaving those Isles on the East; in this
Course we passed the Line in about .12 Days'time, and were by our last
Observation in 7 Degrees 22 Min. Northern Latitude, when a violent
Tornado or Hurricane took us quite out of our Knowledge; it began
from the South-East, came about to the North-West, and then settled
into the North-East, from whence it blew in such a terrible manner,
that for j 2 Days together we could do nothing but drive, and scudding
away before it, let it carry us whither ever Fate and the Fury of the
Winds directed; and during these 12 Days', I need not say, that I
expected every Day to be swallowed up, nor indeed did any in the
Ship expect to save their Lives.
In this Distress, we had, besides the Terror of the Storm, one of
our Men died of the Calenture, and one Man and the Boy washed
overboard; about the 12th Day the Weather abating a little, the
Master made an Observation as well as he could, and found that he
was in about 11 Degrees North Latitude, but that he was 22 Degrees
of Longitude difference West from Cape St Augustino; so that he
found he was gotten upon the Coast of Guinea, or the North Part of
Brasil, beyond the River Amazones, toward that cf the River Oronoqut,
commonly called the Great River, and began to consult with me what
Course he should take, for the Ship was leaky and very much disabled,
and he was going directly back to the Coast of Brasil.
I was positively against that, and looking over Charts of the Sea-
Coast of America with him, we concluded there was no inhabited
Country for us to have recourse to, till we came within the Circle c!
foe Carribbe-Islaiids, and therefore resolved to stand away for Barba-
does, which by keeping off at Sea, to "avoid the Indraft of the Bay or
Gulf of Mexico, we might easily perform, as we hoped, in about fif-
teen Days' Sail; whereas we could not possibly make our Voyage to
the Coast of Africa without some Assistance, both to our Ship and
to ourselves.
With this Design we changed our Course and steered away N. IV.
by W. in order to reach some of our English Islands, where I hoped
for Relief; but our Voyage was otherwise determined, for being in
the Latitude of 12 Deg. 18 Min. a second Storm came upon us, which
earned us away with the same Impetuosity Westward, and drove us so
out of the very Way of all human Commerce, that had all our Lives
been saved, as to the Sea, we were rather in Danger of being de
voured by Savages than ever returning to our own Country.
In this Distress, the Wind still blowing very hard, one of our Men
early in the Morning, cried out, Land; and we had no sooner run
out of the Cabin to look out in hopes of seeing whereabouts in
the World we were; but the Ship struck upon a Sand, and in a
moment her Motion being so stopped, the Sea broke over her in
such a manner, that we expected we should all have perish'd imine-
-Siately, and we were immediately driven into our close Quarters to
shelter us from the very Foam and Spray of the Sea.
It is not easy for any one, who has not been in the like Condition,
to describe or conceive the Consternation of Men in such Circum-
stances; we knew nothing where we were, or upon what Land it was
we were driven, whether an Island or the Main, whether inhabited
or not inhabited; and as the Rage of tne Wind was still great,
though rather less than at first, we could not so much as hope to have
the Ship hold many Minutes without breaking in Pieces, unless the
Winds by a kind of Miracle should turn immediately about In a
word, w; sat looking one upon another, and expecting Death every
Moment, and every Man acting accordingly, as preparing for another
World, for there was little or nothing more for us to do in this;
that which was our present Comfort, and all the Comfort we had,
was, that contrary to our Expectation the Ship did not break yet,
and that the Master said U12 Wind began to abate.
Now though we thought that the Wind did a little abate, yet the Ship
having thus struck upon the Sand, and sticking too fast for us to ex-
pect her getting off, we were in a dreadful Condition indeed, and
had nothing to do but to think of saving our Lives as well as we
could; we had a Boat at our Stern just before the Storm, but she
was first staved by dashing against the Ship's Rudder, and in the
next Place she broke away, and either sunk or was driven off to
Sea, so there was no hope from her; we had another Boat on board,
but how to get her off into the Sea, was a doubtful thing; however,
there was no room to debate, for we fancied the Ship would break
in Pieces every Minute, and some told us she was actually broken
already.
In this Distress, the Mate of our Vessel lays hold of the Boat, and
with the help of the rest of the Men, they got her slung over the
Ship's side, and getting all into her, let go, and committed ourselves
being Eleven in Number, to God's Mercy, and the wild Sea; for though
the Storm was abated considerably, yet the Sea went dreadful high
npon the Shore, and might well be called, Den wild Zee, as the Dutch
call the Sea in a Storm.
And now our Case was very dismal indeed; for we all saw plainly
that the Sea went so high, that the Boat could not live, and that we
should be inevitably drowned. As to making Sail, we had none, nor,
if we had, could we have done anything with it; so we worked at the
Oar towards the Land, though with heavy Hearts, like Men going to
Execution; for we all knew, that when the Boat came nearer the
Shore, she would be dashed in a Thousand Pieces by the Breach of
the Sea. However, we committed our Souls to God in the most
earnest Manner, and the Wind driving us towards the Shore, we
hasten'd our Destruction with our own Hands, pulling as well as we
could towards Land.
What the Shore was, whether Rock or Sand, whether Steep or
Shoal, we knew not; the only Hope that could rationally give us the
least Shadow of Expectation, was, if we might happen into some Bay
or Gulf, or the Mouth of some River, where by great Chance we
might have run our Boat in, or got under the Lee of the Land, and
perhaps made smooth Water. But there was nothing of this appeared;
but as we made nearer and nearer the Shore, the Land looked more
frightful than the Sea.
After we had rowed, or rather driven about a League and a Half,-
as we reckon'd it, a raging Wave, Mountain-like, came rolling a-ster
n
of us, and plainly bade us expect the Coup-de-Grace. In a word, it
took us with such a Fury, that it overset the Boat at once; and sepa-
rating us as well from the Boat, as from one another, gave us not
time hardly to say, O God 1 for we were all swallowed up in a Mo
ment
Nothing can describe the Confusion of Thought which I felt when
1 sunk into the Water; for though I swam very well, yet I could not
deliver myself from the Waves so as to draw Breath, till that Wavy
having driven me, or rather carried me a vast Way on towards the
Shore, and having spent itself, went back, and left me upon the
Land almost dry, but half dead with the Water I took in. I had so
tuch Presence of Mind as well as Breath left, that seeing myself

nearer the main Land than I expected, I got upon my Feet, and en-
deavoured to make on towards the Land as fast as I could, before
another Wave should return, and take me up again. But I soon
found it was impossible to avoid it; for I saw the Sea come after me
as high as a great Hill, and as furious as an Enemy which I had no
Means or Strength to contend with; my Business was to hold my
Breath, and raise myself upon the Water, if I could; and so by
swimming to preserve my Breathing, and Pilot myself towards the
Shore, if possible; my greatest Concern now being, that the Sea, as
it would carry me a great Way towards the Shore when it came on,
might not carry me back again with it when it gave back towards the
Sea.
The Wave that came upon me again, buried me at once 20 or 30

Foot deep in its own Body; and I could feel myself carried with s
mighty Force and Swiftness towards the Shore a very great Way; but
I held my Breath, and assisted myself to swim still forward with all
my Might I was ready to burst with holding my Breath, when, as I
elt myself rising up, so to my immediate Relief, I found my Head
nd Hands shoot out above the Surface of the Waiei; and though it
was not two Seconds of Time that I could keep myself so, yet it
reliev'd me greatly, gave me Breath and new Courage. I was covered
again with Water a good while, but not so long but I held it out; and
finding the Water had spent itself, and began to return, I struck for-
ward against the Return of the Waves, and felt Ground again with
my Feet I stood still a few Moments to recover Breath, and till the
Water went from me, and then took to my Heels, and run with what
38
ADVENTURES OF
StrengtL i had farther towards the Shore. But neither would this
deliver me from the Fury of the Sea, which came pouring in after me
again, and twice more I was lifted up by the Waves, and carried for-
wards as before, the Shore being very flat
The last Time of these two had well near been fatal to me; for the
Sea having hurried me along as before, landed me, or rather dashed
me against a Piece of a Rock, and that with such Force, as it left me
senseless, and indeed helpless, as to my own Deliverance; for the
Blow taking my Side and Breast, beat the Breath as it were quite out
of my Body; and had it returned again immediately, I must have been
strangled in the Water; but I recover'd a little before the return of
the Waves, and seeing I should be cover'd again with the Water, I
resolv'd to hold fast by a Piece of the Rock, and so to hold my
Breath, if possible, till the Wave weut back; now as the Waves were
not so high as at first,
being nearer Land, I
held my Hold till the
Wave abated, and
then fetched another
Run, which brought
me so near the Shore,
that the next Wave,
though it went over
me, yet did not so
swallow me up as to
carry me away, and
the next run I took, I
got to the main Land,
yhere, to my great Comfort, I clamber'd up the Cliffs of the Shore,
and sat me down upon the Grass, free from Danger, and quite out of
the Reach of the Water.
I was now landed, and safe on Shore, and began to look up and
thank God that my Life was saved in a Case wherein there was some
Minutes before scarce any room to hope. I believe it is impossible
to express to the Life what the Ecstasies and Transports of the Sou'
are, when it is so saved, as I may say, out of the very Grave; and 1
do not wonder now at that Custom, viz. That when a Malefactor, who
has the Halter about his Neck, is tied up, and just going to be turned
off. and has a Reprieve brought to him: I say, I do not wonder that

they bring a Surgeon with it, to let him Blood that very Moment
they tell him of it, that the Surprise may not drive the Animal Spirits
from the Heart, and overwhelm him: I
For sudden Joys, like Griefs, confound at first. '.
I walked about on the Shore, lifting up my Hands, and my whole
Being, as I may say, wrapt up in the Contemplation of my Deliverance,
making a Thousand Gestures and Motions which I cannot describe,
reflecting upon all my Comrades that were drowned, and that there
should not be one Soul saved but myself; for, as for them, I never
saw them afterwards, or any Sign of them, except three of their Hats,
one Cap, and two Shoes that were not Fellows.
I cast my Eyes to the stranded Vessel, when the Breach and Froth
of the Sea being so big, I could hardly see it, it lay so far oft", and
considered, Lord! how was it possible I could get on Shore?
After I had solac'd my Mind with the comfortable Part of my Con-
dition, I began to look round me to see what kind of Place I was in,
and what was next to be done, and I soon found my Comforts abate,
and that in a word I had a dreadful Deliverance: For I was wet,
had no Clothes to shift me, nor anything either to eat or drink to
comfort me, neither did I see any Prospect before me, but that of
perishing with Hunger, or being devour'd by wild Beasts; and that
which was particularly afflicting to me, was, that I had no Weapon
either to hunt and kill any Creature for my Sustenance, or to defend
myself against any other Creature that might desire to kill me for
theirs: In a Word, I had nothing about me but a Knife, a Tobacco-
pipe, and a little Tobacco in a Box, this was all my Provision, and
this threw me into terrible Agonies of Mind, that for a while I ran
about like a Madman; Night coming upon me, I began with a heavy
Heart to consider what would be my Lot if there were any ravenous
Beasts in that Country, seeing at Night they always come abroad for
their Prey.
All the Remedy that ofter'd to my Thoughts at that Time, was, to
get up into a thick bushy Tree like a Fir, but thorny, which grew
near me, and where I resolv'd to sit all Night, and consider the next
Day what Death I should die, for as yet I saw no Prospect of life;
I walked about a Furlong from the Shore, to see if I could find any
fresh Water to drink, which I did, to my great Joy; and having
drank and put a little Tobacco in my Mouth to prevent Hunger, I
went to the Tree, and getting up into it, endeavour'd to place myself

so, as that if I should sleep I might not fall; and having cui me a
short Stick, like a Truncheon, for my Defence, I took up my Lodging,
and having been excessively fatigu'd, I fell fast asleep, and slept as
comfortably as, I believe, few could have done in my Condition, and
found myself the most refresh'd with it, that I think I ever was on
such an Occasion.
When I waked it was broad Day, the Weather clear, and the Storm
abated, so that the Sea did not rage and swell as before: But that
which surpris'd me most, was, that the Ship was lifted offin the Nigh*
from the Sand where she lay, by the Swelling of Tide, and was
driven up almost as far as the Rock which I first mention'd, where I
r a i been so bruised by the dashing me against it; this being within
about a Mile from the Shore
where I was, and the Ship seem-
ing to stand upright still, I wished
myself on board, that, at least,
I might have some necessary
things for my use.
When I came down from my
Apartment in the Tree, I looked
about me again, and the first
thing I found was the Boat,
which lay as the Wind and the
Sea had tossed her up upon the
Land, about two Miles on my
right Hand, I walked as far as
I could upon the Shore to have got to her, but found a Neck or
Inlet of Water '.between me and the Boat, which was about half a
Mile broad, so I came back for the present, being more intent upon
getting at the Ship, where I hoped to find something for my present
Subsistence.
A little after Noon I found the Sea very calm, and the Tide ebbed
so far out, that I could come within a Quarter of a Mile of the Ship;
and here I found a fresh renewing of my Grief, for I saw evidently,
that if we had kept on board, we had all been safe, that is to say,
we had all got safe on Shore, and I had not been so miserable
as to be left -entirely destitute of all Comfort and Company, as I
now was; this forced Tears from my Eyes again, but as there
was little Relief in that; I resolv'd, if possible, to get to the Ship, so

I pulled off my Clothes, for the Weather was hot to the Extremity,
and took the Water, but when I came to the Ship, my Difficulty was
*till greater to know how to get on board, for as she lay a-ground,
and high out of the Water, there was nothing within my Reach to lay
.X)ld of, I swam round her twice, and the second Time I spied a
small Piece of a Rope, which I wonder'd I did not see at first, hang
down by the Fore-Chains so low, as that with great Difficulty I got
hold of it, and by the help of that Rope, got up into the Forecastle
of the Ship, here I found that the Ship was bulged, and had a great
deal of Water in her Wold, but that she lay so on the Side of a
Bank of hard Sf.^d, or rather Earth, that her Ster n lay lifted up upon
the Bank, and her Head low almost to the Water; by this Means all
her Quarter was free, and all that was in that Part was dry; for you
may be sure my first Work was to search and to see what was spoiled
and what was free; and first I found that all the Ship's Provisions
were dry and untouch'd by the Water,and being very well dispos'd to eat,
I went to the Bread-room and filled my Pockets with Biscuit, and eat
k as I went about other things, for I had no time to lose; I also
found some Rum in the great Cabin, of which I took a large
Dram, and which I had indeed need enough of to spirit me for
what was before me: Now I wanted nothing but a Boat to furnish
myself with many things which I foresaw would be very necessary
to me.
It was in vain to sit still and wish for what was not to be had, and
this Extremity roused my Application; we had several spare Yards,
and two or three large spars of Wood, and a spare Topmast or two
in the Ship; I resolv'd to fall to work with these, and flung as many
of them overboard as I could manage for their Weight, tying every
one with a Rope that they might not drive away; when this was
done I went down the Ship's Side, and pulling them to me, I tied
four of them fast together at both Ends as well as I could, in the
Form of a Raft, and laying two or three short Pieces of Plank upon
them crossways, I found I could walk upon it very well, but that it
was not able to bear any great Weight, the Pieces being too light; sc
I went to work, and with the Carpenter's Saw I cut a spare Topmas*
into three Lengths, and added them to my Raft, with a great deal oi
Labour and Pains, but hope of furnishing myself with Necessaries,
encourag'd me to go beyond what I should have been able to have
done upon another Occasion.

ADVENTURES OF
My Raft was now strong enough to bear any reasonable Weight;
my next Care was what to load it with, and how to preserve what I
laid upon it from the Surf of the Sea; But I was not long considering
this, I first laid all the Plank or Boards upon it that I could get, and
having consider'd well what I most wanted, I first got three of the
Seamen's Chests, which I had broken open and empty'd, and lower'd
them down upon my Raft; the first of these I filled with Provisions,
viz. Bread, Rice, three Dutch Cheeses, five Pieces of dried Goat's
Flesh, which we lived much upon, and a little Remainder of European
Corn which had been laid by for some Fowls which we brought to

Sea with us, but the Fowls were killed, there had been some Barley
and Wheat together, but, to my great disappointment, I found after-
wards that the Rats had eaten or spoiled it all; as for Liquors I
found severd Cases of Bottles belonging to our Skipper, £ which
were some Cord.al Water,, and in all about five or Z Gallons of

hem into the Chest, nor no room for them. While I was doing this.
found AeT.de began to flow, though very calm, and I had the Mo£
ficafon to see my Coat, Shirt, and Waistcoat, which I had left oo
Shore upon the Sand, swim away; as for mv Breeches which%£
43
only Linen and open-kneed, I swam on board in them and my
Stockings: However this put me upon rummaging for Clothes, oi
which I found enough, but took no more than I wanted for present
use, for I had other things which my Eye was more upon, as first
Tools to work with on Shore, and it was after long searching that 1
found out the Carpenter's Chest, which was indeed a vrry useful
Prize to me, and much more valuable tr.:.n a Ship Loading of Gold
would have been at that
time; I got it down to
my Raft, even whole as
it was, without losii„
time to look into it, for
I knew in general what
it contain'd.
My next Care was for
some Ammunition, and
Arms; there were twe
very good Fowling-pieces
in the great Cabin, and
two Pistols, thece I se-
cur'd first, with some
Powder-horns, and a
small Bag of Shot, and
two old rusty Swords: I
knew there were three
Barrels of Powder in the
Ship, but knew not where
our Gunner had stowed
them, but with m1''
search I found them,
two of them dry and
good, the third had taken Water, those two I got to my Raft, with
the Arms, and now I thought myself pretty well freighted, and began
to think how I should get to Shore with them, having neither Sail.
Oar, or Rudder, and the least Capfull of Wind would have overse\
9JI my Navigation.
I had three Encouragements, 1. A smooth calm Sea, a. The Tide
rising and setting in to the Shore, 3. What little Wind there was
blew me towards the Land; and thus, having found *wo or three

44
ADVENTURES OB
broken Oars belonging to the Boat, and besides the Tools which were
in the Chest, I found two Saws, an Axe, and a Hammer, and
with this Cargo I put to Sea: For a Mile, or thereabouts, my Raft
went very well, only that I found it drive a little distant from the
Place where I had landed before, by which I perceiv'd that there was
some Indraft of the Water, and consequently I hoped to find some
Creek or River there, which I might make use of as a Port to get to
Land with my Cargo.
As I imagin'd, so it was, there appear'd befoie me a little opening
rf the Land, and I found a strong Current of the Tide set into it, so

I guided my Raft as well as I could to keep in the Middle of the
Stream: But here I had like to have suffer'd a second Shipwreck,
which, if I had, I think verily would have broke my Heart, for know,
ing nothing of the Coast, my Raft run a-ground at one end of it upon
a Shoal, and not being a-ground at the other End, it wanted but a
little that all my Cargo had slipped off towards that End that was
afloat, and so fallen into the Water: I did my utmost by setting my
Back against the Chests, to keep them in their Places, but could not
thrust off the Raft with all my Strength, neither durst I stir from the
Posture I was in, but holding up the Chests with all my Might, stood
in that Manner near half an Hour, in which time the rising of the
Water brought me a little more upon a Level, and a little after, the
Water still rising, my Raft floated again, and I thrust her off with the
Oar I had, into the Channel, and then driving up higher, I at length
found myself in the Mouth of a little River, with Land on both Sides,
and a strong Current or Tide running up, I looked on both Sides for
a proper Place to get to Shore, for I was not willing to be driven too
high up the River, hoping in time to see some Ship at Sea, and there-
fore resolv'd to place myself as near the Coast as I could.
At length I spied a little Cove on the right Shore of the Creek, to
which with great Pain and Difficulty I guided my Raft, and at last
got so near, as that, reaching Ground with my Oar, I could thrust her
directly in, but here I had like to have dipped all my Cargo in the Sea
again; for that Shore lying pretty steep, that is to say sloping, there
was no Place to land, but where one End of my Float, if it run on
Shore, would lie so high, and the other sink lower as before, that it
would endanger my Cargo again: All that I could do, was to wait till
the Tide was at highest, keeping the Faft with my Oar like an
Anchor to hold the Side of it fast to the Shore, near a flat Piece of
Ground, which I expected the Water would flow over; andVso it did:
As soon as I found Water enough, for my Raft drew about a Foot of
Water, I thrust her on upon that flat Piece of Ground, and there
fast-m'd or moored her by sticking my two broken Oars into the Ground;
one on one Side near one End, and one on the other Side near the
other End; and thus I lay till the Water ebbed away, and left my
P.aft and all my Cargo safe on Shore.
My next Work was to view the Country, and seek a proper Place
for my Habitation, and where to stow my Goods to secure them from
whatever might happen; where I was I yet knew not, whether on the
Continent or on an Island, whether inhabited or not inhabited, whe-
ther in Danger of wild Beasts or not: There was a Hill not above a
Mile from me, which rose up very steep and high, and which seemed
to over-top some other Hills which lay as in a Ridge from it north-
ward; I took out one of the fowling Pieces, and one of the Pistols,
and an Horn of Powder, and thus armed I travell'd for Discovery up
to the Top of that Hill, where after I had with great Labour and
Difficulty got to the Top, I saw my Fate to my great Affliction, (viz.)
tfiat I was in an Island environ'd every Way with the Sea, no Land

ADVENTURES OF
to be seen, except some Rocks which lay a great Way off, and two small
Islands less than this, which lay about three Leagues to the West
I found also that the Island I was in was barren, and, as I saw
good Reason to believe, uninhabited, except by wild Beasts, of whom
however I saw none, yet I saw Abundance of Fowls, but knew not
their Kinds, neither when I killed
them could I tell what was fit for
Food, and what not; at my coming
back, I shot at a great Bird which
I saw sitting upon a Tree on the
Side of a great Wood, I believe it
was the first Gun that had been
fired there since the Creation of the
World; I had no sooner fired, but
from all the Parts of the Wood
there arose an innumerable Number
of Fowls of many Sorts, making a
confus'd Screaming, and crying
every one according to his usual
Note; but not one of them of any
Kind that I knew: As for the
Creature I killed, I took it to be a
Kind of a Hawk, its Colour and
Beak resembling it, but had no
Talons or Claws more than com-
mon, its Flesh was Carrion, and fit
for nothing.
Contented with this Discovery,
I came back to my Raft, and fell
to Work to bring my Cargo on Shore, which took me up the rest of
that Day, and what to do with myself at Night I knew not, nor indeed
whero to rest; for I was afraid to lie down on the Ground, not know-
ing but some wild Beast might devour me, though as I afterwards found,
there was really no Need for those Fears.
However, as well as I could, I barncado'd myself round with the
Chests and Boards that I had brought on Shore, and made a Kind of
a Hut for that Night's Lodging; as for Food, I yet saw not which
Way to supply myself, except I had seen two or three Creatures like
Hares run out of the Wood where I shot the FowL

1 now began to consider, that I might yet get a great many Things
cut of the Ship, which would be useful to me, and particularly some of
the Rigging, and Sails, and such other Things as might come to Lind,
and I resolv'd to make another Voyage on Board the Vessel, if pos-
sible; and as I knew that the first Storm that blew must necessarily
break her all in Pieces, I resolv'd to set all other Things apart, until I
got everything out of the Ship that I could get; then I called a
Council, that is to say, in my Thoughts, whether I should take back
the Raft, but this appear'd impracticable; so I resolv'd to go as before,
when the Tide was down, and I did so, only that I stripped before I
went from my Hut, having nothing on but a Chequer'd Shirt and a
Pair of Linen Drawers, and a Pair of Pumps on my Feet

I got on Board the Ship, as before, and prepar'd a second Raft, and
having had Experience of the first, I neither made this so unwieldy,
nor loaded it so hard, but yet I brought away several Things very
useful to me; as first, in the Carpenter's Stores I found two or three
Bags full of Nails and Spikes, a great Screw-Jack, a Dozen or two of
Hatchets, and above all, that most useful Thing called a Grindstone;
all these I secured together, with several Things belonging to the
Gunner, particularly two or three Iron Crows, and two Barrels of
Musket-Bullets, seven Muskets, and another fowling Piece, with
iome small Quantity of Powder more; a large Bag full of small
Shot, and a great Roll of Sheet Lead: But this Last was so '. .avy, I
could not hoist it up to get it over the Ship's Side.
Besides these Things, I took all the Men's Clothes that I could
find, and a spare Fore-topsail, a Hammock, and some Bedding; and
with this I loaded my second Raft, and brought them all safe on
Shore to my very great Comfort
I was under some Apprehensions during my Absence from the
Land, that at least my Provisions might be devour'd on Shore; but
when I came back, I found no Sign of any Visitor, only there sat a
Creature like a wild Cat upon one of the Chests, which when I came
towards it, ran away a little Distance, and then stood still; she sat
rery compos'd, and unconcern'd, and looked full in my Face, as if she
had a Mind to be acquainted with me, I presented my Gun at her,
but as she did not understand it, she was perfectly unconcern'd at it,
nor did she offer to stir away; upon which I tossed her a Bit of Biscuit,
though by the Way I was not very free of it, for my Store was not great:
However, I spared her a Bit, I say, and she went to it, smelled of it,
and ate it, and looked (as pleased) for more, but I thanked her, and
could spare no more; so she marched off.
Having got my second Cargo on Shore, though I was fain to open
the Barrels of Powder, and bring them by Parcels, for they were
too heavy, being large Casks, I went to work to make me a little
Tent with the Sail and some Poles which I cut for that Purpose, and
into this Tent I brought everything that I knew would spoil, either
with Rain or Sun, and I piled all the empty Chests and Casks up in
a Circle round the Tent, to fortify it from any sudden Attempt, either
from Man or Beast
When I had done this I blocked up the Door of the Tent with some
Boards within, and an empty Chest set up or End without, and spread-
ing one of the Beds upon the Ground, laying my two Pistols just at
my Head, and my Gun at Length by me, I went to Bed for the first
Time, and slept very quietly all Night, for I was very weary and
heavy, for the Night before I had slept little, and had labour'd
very hard all Day, as well to fetch all those Things from the Ship, as
to get them on Shore.
I had the biggest Magazine of all Kinds now that ever were laid
up, I believe, for one Man, but I was not satisfy'd still; for while
the Ship sat upright in that Posture, I thought I ought to get every-
thing out of her that I could; so every Day at low Water I went on
Board, and brought away something or other: But particularly the
third Time I went, I brought away as much of the Rigging as I could,
as also all the small Ropes and Rope-twine I could get, with a Piece
49
of spare Canvas, which was to mend the Sails upon Occasion, the
Barrel of wet Gunpowder: In a Word, I brought away all the Sails
ftrst and last, only that I was fain to cut them in Pieces, and bring as
much at a Time as I could; for they were no more useful to be Sails,
but as mere Canvas only.
But that which comforted me more still, was, that at tast of all,
after I had made five or six such Voyages as these, and thought I baif
nothing more to expect from the Ship that was worth ray meddling with,
I say, after all this, I found a great Hogshead of Bread, and three
large Runlets of Rum or Spirits, and a Box of Sugar, and a Barrel

of fine Flour; this was surprising to rr.e, because I had given over
expecting any more Provisions, except what was spoiled by the Water:
I soon empty'd the Hogshead of that Bread, and wrapt it up Parcel
by Parcel in Pieces of the Sails, which I cut out; and in a Word, I
get all this safe on Shore also.
The next Day I made another Voyage; and now having plunder'd
the Ship of what was portable and fit to hand out, I began with the
Cables; and cutting the great Cable into Pieces, such as I could
move, I got two Cables and a Hawser on Shore, with all the Iron-
work I could get; and having cut down the Spritsail-yard, and the
Missen-yard, and everything I could to make a large Raft, I loaded
it with all those heavy Goods, and came away: But my good Luck
began now to leave me; for this Raft was so unwieldy, and so over-
laden, that after I was entePd the little Cove, where I had landed the
rest of my Goods, not being able to guide it so handily as I did the
other, it overset, and threw me and all my Cargo into the Water;
as for myself it was no great Harm, for I was near the Shore;
but as to my Cargo, it was great Part of it lost, especially the Iron,
which I expected would have been of great Use to me: However,
when the Tide was out, I got most of the Pieces of Cable ashore, and
some of the Iron, though with infinite Labour; for I was fain to dip for
it into the Water, a Work which fatigu'd me very much: After this I
went every Day on Board, and brought away what I could get
I had been now Thirteen Days on Shore, and had been eleven
Times on Board the Ship; in which Time I had brought away alJ
that one Pair of Hands could well be suppos'd capable to bring, though
I believe verily, had the calm Weather held, I should have brought
away the whole Ship Piece by Piece: But preparing the 12 th Time
to go on Board, I found the Wind begin to rise; however at low
Waterl wenton Board,and though I thought I hadrummag'd the Cabin
so effectually, as that nothing more could be found, yet I discover'd a
Locker with Drapers in it, in one of which I found two or three
Razors, and one Pair of large Scissars, with some ten or a dozen of
good Knives and Forks; in another I found about Thirty six-Pounds
value in Money, some European Coin, some Brasil, some Pieces of
Eight, some Gold, some Silver.
I smiled to myself at the Sight of this Money, O Drug! said I
aloud, what art thou good for, Thou art not worth to me, no not the
taking off of the Ground, one of those Knives is worth all this Heap,
I have no Manner of use for thee, e'en remain where thou art, and
go tc the Bottom as a Creature whose Life is not worth saving. How
ever upon Second Thoughts, I took it away, and wrapping all this in
a Piece of Canvas, I began to think of making another Raft, but whUe
I was preparing this, I found the Sky overcast, and the Wind began
to rise, and in a Quarter of an Hour it blew a fresh Gale from the
Shore; it presently occur'd to me, that it was in vain to pretend to
make a Raft with the Wind off Shore, and that it was my Business to
be gone before the Tide of Flood began, otherwise I might not be
able to reach the Shore at all: Accordingly I let myself down into
Urn Water, and swam cross the Channel, which lay between the Ship
and the Sands, and even that with Difficulty enough, partly with the
Weight of the Things I had about me, and partly the Roughness of
the Water, for the Wind rose very hastily, and before it was quite high
Water, it blew a Storm.
But I was gotten home to my little Tent, where I lay with all my
Wealth about me very secure. It blew very hard all that Night, and in
the Morning when I looked out, behold no more Ship was to be seen;
I was a little surpriz'd, but recover'd myself with this satisfactory Re-
flection, vie. That I had lost no time, nor abated no Diligence to get
everything out of her that could be useful to me, and that indeed there
was little left in her that I was able to bring away if I had had more time.
I now gave over any more Thoughts of the Ship, or of anything
out of her, except what might drive on Shore from her Wreck, as
indeed divers Pieces of her afterwards did; but those things were of
small use to me.
My Thoughts were now wholly employ'd about securing myself
against either Savages, if any should appear, or wild Beasts, if any
were in the Island; and I had many Thoughts of the Method how to
do this, and what kind of Dwelling to make, whether I snould make
me a Cave in the Earth, or a Tent upon the Earth: And, in short,
I resolv'd upon both, the Manner and Description of which, it may
not be improper to give an Account of.
I soon found the Place I was in was not for my Settlement, parti-
cularly because it was upon a low moorish Ground near the Sea, and
I believ'd would not be wholesome, and more particularly because
there was no fresh Water near it, so I resolv'd to find a more healthy
and more convenient Spot of Ground.
/ I consulted several Things in my Situation which I found would
be proper for me. ist, Health, and fresh Water I just now mentioned,
adly, Shelter from the Heat of the Sun. 3dly, Security from ravenous
Creatures, whether Men or Beasts. 4thly, a View to the Sea, that if
God sent any Ship in Sight, I might not lose any Advantage for my
Deliverance, of which I was not willing to banish all my Expectation yet
In search of a Place proper for this, I found a little Plain on the
side of a rising Hill, whose Front towards this little Plain, was steep
as a House-side, so that nothing could come down upon me from the
Top; on the Side of this Rock there was a hollow Place worn a little
way in like the Entrance or Door of a Cave, but there was not really
any Cave or Way into the Rock at all. f
On the Flat of the Green, just before this hollow Place, I resolvd
to pitch my Tent; This Plain was not above an Hundred Yards broad
and about twice as long, and lay like a Green before my Door, and a1
the End of it descended irregularly every Way down into the Low-
grounds by the Sea-side. It was on the JV.M W. Side of the Hill,
so that I was shelter'd from the Heat every Day, till it came to a W.
and by S. Sun, or thereabouts, which in those Countries is near the
Setting.
Before I set up my Tent, I drew a half Circle before the hollow
Place, which took in about Ten Yards in its Semi-diameter from the
Rock, and Twenty Yards in its Diameter, from its Beginning and
Ending.
In this half Circle I pitched two Rows of strong Stakes, driving
them into the Ground till they stood very firm like Piles, the biggest
End being out of the Ground about Five Foot and a Half, and
sharpen'd on the Top: The two Rows did not stand above Six
Inches from one another.
Then I took the Pieces of Cable which I had cut in the Ship, and
I laid them in Rows one upon another, within the Circle, between
these two Rows of Stakes, up to the Top, placing other Stakes in the
Inside, leaning against them, about two Foot and a half high, like a
Spur to a Post, and this Fence was so strong, that neither Man or
Beast could gee into it or over it: This cost me a great deal of Time
and Labour, especially to cut the Piles in the Woods, bring them to
the Place, and drive them into the Earth.
The Entrance into this Place I made to be not by a Door, but
by a short Ladder to go over the Top, which Ladder, when I was in,
I lifted over after me, and so I was completely fenced in, and forti-
fied, as I thought, from all the World, and consequently slept secure
in the Night, which otherwise I could not have done, though as it ap-
pear'd afterward, there was no need of all this Caution from the Ene-
mies that I apprehended Danger from.
Into this Fence or Fortress, with infinite Labour, I carried all my
Riches, all my Provisions, Ammunition and Stores, of which you
have the Account above, and I made me a large Tent, which, to pre-
serve me from the Rains that in one Part of the Year are very vio-
lent there, I made double, viz. One smaller Tent within, and ona
larger Tent above it, and cover'd the uppermost with a large Tarpau-
lin which I had saved among the Sails.
^nd now I lay no more for a while in the Bed which I had brought
on Shore, but in a Hammock, which was indeed a very good one, and
belong^ to the Mate of the Ship.
Into this Tent I brought all my Provisions, and everything that
would spoil by the Wet, and having thus enclos'd all my Goods, I
made up the Entrance, which till now I had left open, and so passed
and repass'd, as I said, by a short Ladder.
When I had done this, I began to work my Way into the Rock,
and bringing all the Earth and Stones that I dug down out through my
Tent, I laid them up within my Fence in the Nature of a Terrace, tha.
so it raised the Ground within about a Foot and a Half; and thus I
made me a. Cave just behind my Tent, which served me like a Cellar
to my House.
It cost me much Labour, and many Days, before all these Things
were brought to Perfection, and therefore I must go back to some
other things which took up some of my Thoughts. At the same
time it happen'd after I had laid my Scheme for the setting up my
Tent, and making the Cave, that a Storm of Rain falling from a thick
dark Cloud, a sudden Flash of Lightning happen'd, and after
that a great Clap of Thunder, as is naturally the Effect of it; I was
not so much surpris'd with the Lightning as I was with a Thought
which darted into my Mind as swift as the Lightning itself: O my
Powder! My very Heart sunk within me, when I thought, that at
one Blast all my Powder might be destroyed, on which, not my de-
fence only, but the providing me Food, as I thought, entirely
depended; I was nothing near so anxious about my own Danger,
though had the Powder took fire, I had never known who had hurt
me.
Such Impression did this make upon me, that after the Storm was
over, I laid aside all my Works, my Building, and Fortifying, and
applied myself to make Bags and Boxes to separate the Powder, and
keep it a little and a little in a Parcel, in hope, that whatever might
come, it might not all take Fire at once, and to keep it so apart that
it should not be possible to make one part fire another: I finish'd
this Work in about a Fortnight, and I think my Powder, which in all
was about 240 lb. weight was divided in not less than a Hundred
Parcels ; as to the Barrel that had been wet, I did not apprehend any
Danger from that, so I placed it in my new Cave, which in my Fancy
I called my Kitchen, and the re?t I hid up and down in Holes among
54
ADVENTURES OF
the Rocks, so that no wet might come to it, marking very carefull*
where I laid it
In the Interval of time while this was doing I went out once at
least every Day with my Gun, as well to divert myself, as to see if I
could kill anything fit for Food, and as near as I could to acquaint
myself with what the Island produc'd. The first time I went out I
presently discovert that there were Goats in the Island, which was
a great Satisfaction to me; but then it was attended with this
Misfortune to me, viz. That they were so shy, so subtile, and so
swift of Foot, that it was the difficultest thing in the World to
come at them: But I was not discourag'd at this, not doubting
but I might now and then shoot one, as it soon happen'd, for
after I had found
their Haunts a little,
I laid wait in this
Manner for them: I
obseiVd if they saw
me in the Valleys,
though they were upon
the Rocks, they would
run away as in a ter-
rible Fright; but if
they were feeding in
the Valleys, and I was
upon the Rocks, thej
took no Notice of me,
from whence I concluded, that by the Position of their Optics, their
Sight was so directed downward, that they did not readily see Objects
that were above them; so afterward I took this Method, I always climbed
the Rocks first to get above them, and then had frequently a fait
Mark. The first shot I made among these Creatures, I killed a She-
Goat which had a little Kid by her which she gave Suck to, which
grieved me heartily ; but when the Old one fell, the Kid stood stock
still by her till I came and took her up, and not only so, but when
I carried the Old one with me upon my Shoulders, the Kid folloVd
me quite to my Enclosure, upon which I laid down the Dam, and
took the Kid in my Anns, and carried it over my Pale, in hopes to
have bred it up tame, but it would not eat, so I was forced to kill
it and eat it myself; these two supplied me with Flesh a great

55
while, for I eat sparingly; and saved my Provisions (my Bread
especially) as much as possibly I could.
Having now fixed my Habitation, I found it absolutely necessary
to provide a Place to make a Fire in, and Fuel to burn; and what
I did for that, as also how I enlarg'd my Cave, and what Con-
veniences I made, I shall give a fcll Account of in iu Place: E ;t I

Thoughts about
Living, which it

away upon that
Island without
being driven, as
is said, by a
violent Storm
quite out of the
Course of our
intended Voyage,
and a great Way,
viz. some Hun-
dreds of Leagues
out of the ordinary Course of the Trade of Mankind, I kid great
Reason to consider it as a Determination of Heaven, that in this deso-
late Place, and in this desolate Manner I should end my Life; the
Tears would run plentifully down my Face when I made these Re-
flections, and sometimes I would expostulate with myself, Whj
Providence should thus completely ruin its Creatures, and render
them so absolutely miserable, so without Help abandon'd, so entirely
depress'd, that it could hardly be rational to be thankful for such a
Life

But something always return'd swift upon me to check these
Thoughts, and to reprove me; and particularly one Day walking
r/ith my Gun in my Hand by the Sea-side, I was very pensive upon
the Subject of my present Condition, when Reason as it were expos-
tulated with me the other Way, thus: Well, you are in a desolate Con-
dition it is true, but pray remember, Where are the rest of you? Did
not you come Eleven of you into the Boat, where are the Ten? Why
were not they saved and you lost? Why were you singled out? Is it
better to be here or there? and then I pointed to the Sea. All
Evils are to be consider'd with the Good that is in them, and with
what worse attends them.
Then it occurr'd to me again, how well I was furnish'd for my
Subsistence, and what would have been my Case if it had not hap-
pen'd, Which was an Hundred Thousand to one, that the Ship floated
from the Place where she first struck and was driven so near the
Shore that I had time to get all these Things out of her: What would
have been my Case, if I had been to have lived in the Condition in
which I at first came on Shore, without Necessaries of Life, or Neces-
saries to supply and procure them? Particularly said I aloud, (though
to myself) what should I have done without a Gun, without Ammuni
tion, without any Tools to make anything, or to work with, without
Clothes, Bedding, a Tent, or any manner of Covering, and that now
I had all these to a Sufficient Quantity, and was in a fair way to pro-
vide myself in such a manner, as to live without my Gun when my
Ammunition was spent; so that I had a tolerable View of subsisting
without any Want as long as I lived; for I consider'd from the begin-
ning how I would provide for the Accidents that might happen, and
for the time that was to come, even not only after my Ammunition
should be spent, but even after my Health or Strength should
decay.
I confess I had not entertain'd any Notion of my Ammunition
being destroy'd at one Blast, I mean my Powder being blown up by
Lightning, and this made the Thoughts of it so surprising to me when
it lighten'd and thunder'd, as I observ'd just now.
And now being to enter into a melancholy Relation of a Scene of
silent Life, such perhaps as was never heard of in the World before,
I shall take it from its Beginning, and continue it in its Order. It
was, by my Account, the 30th of Seft. when, in the Manner as above-
said, I first set Foot upon this horiid Island) when the Sun being, to
as, in its Autumnal Equinox, was almost just over my Head, for I
reckon'd myself, Ly Observation, to be in the Latitude of 9 Degrees
aa Minutes North of the Line.
After I had been there about Ten or Twelve Days, it came into
my Thoughts, that I should lose my Reckoning of Time for want ot
Books and Pen and Ink, and should even forget the Sabbath Days
from the working Days; but to prevent this I cut it with my Knife
upon a large Post, in Capital Letters, sud making it into a great
Cross I set it up on the Shore where I first landed, viz. I came on
Shore here on the 3oth of'Sept 1659. Upon the Sides of this square
Post, I cut every Day a Notch with my Knife, and every seventh
Notch was as long again as the rest, and every first Day of the
Month as long again as that long one, and thus I kept my Kalendar,
or weekly, monthly, and yearly reckoning of Time.
In the next place we are to observe, that among the many things
which I brought out of the Ship in the several Voyages, which, a*
above mention'd, I made to it, I got several things of less Value, but
not all less useful to me, which I omitted setting down before; as in
particular, Pens, Ink, and Paper, several Parcels in the Captain's,
Mate's, Gunner's, and Carpenter's keeping, three or four Com-
passes, some Mathematical Instruments, Dials, Perspectives,
Charts, and Books of Navigation, all which I huddled together,
whether I might want them or no; also I found three very good
Bibles which came to me in my Cargo from England, and which I
had packed up among my things; some Portuguese Books also, and
among them two or three Popish Prayer-Books, and several other
Books, all which I carefully secur'd. And I must not forget, that we had
in the Ship a Dog and two Cats, of whose eminent History I may
have occasion to say something in its Place; for I carried both the
Cats with me; and as for the Dog, he jumped out of the Ship ot
himself and swam on Shore to me the Day after I went on Shore
with my first Cargo, and was a trusty Servant to me many Years; I
wanted nothing that he could fetch me, nor any Company that he
could make up to me, I only wanted to have him talk to me, but that
would not do: As I observ'd before, I found Pen, Ink and Paper,
and I husbanded them to the utmost, and I shall show, that while
my Ink lasted, I kept things very exact, but after that was gone, I
could not, for I could not make any Ink by any Means that I couM
devise.
And this put me in mind that I wanted many things, notwithstanding
all that I had amassed together, and of these, this of Ink was one,
as also Spade, Pick-Axe and Shovel, to dig or remove the Earth,
Needles, Pins, and Thread; as for Linen, I soon learned to want that
without much Difficulty.
This want of Tools made every Work I did go on heavily, and it
was near a whole Year before I had entirely finish'd my little Pale or
surrounded Habitation: The Piles or Stakes, which were as heavy as
I could well lift, were a long time in cutting and preparing in the
Woods, and more by far in bringing home, so that I spent sometimes
two Days in cutting and bringing home one of those Posts, and a
third Day in driving it into the Ground; for which Purpose I got a
heavy Piece of Wood at first, but at last bethought myself of one of
the Iron Crows, which however, though I found it, yet it made driving
those Posts or Piles very laborious and tedious Work.
But what need I have been concern'd at the Tediousness of any.
thing I had to do, seeing I had time enough to do it in, nor had I
any other Employment if that had been over, at least, that I could
foresee, except the ranging the Island to seek for Food, which I did
more or less every Day.
I now began to consider seriously my Condition, and the Circum-
stance I was reduc'd to, and I drew up the State of my Affairs in
Writing, not so much to leave them to any that were to come after me,
for I was like to have but few Heirs, as to deliver my Thoughts from
daily poring upon them, and afflicting my Mind; and as my Reason
began now to master my Despondency, I began to comfort myself as
well as I could, and to set the good against the Evil, that I might
have something to distinguish my Case from worse, and I stated it
very impartially, like Debtor and Creditor, the Comforts I enjoy'd,
«gainst the Miseries I suffer'd, Thus,

undoubted Testimony, that thers
was scarce any Condition in the World so miserable, but there was
something Negative or something Positive to be thankful for in it; and
let this stand as a Direction from the Experience of the most mise-
rable of all Conditions in this World, that we may always find in it
something to comfort ourselves from, and to set in the Description of
Good and Evil, on the Credit Side of the Account
Having now brought my Mind a little to relish my Condition, and
given over looking out to Sea to see if I could spy a Ship, I say,
giving over these things, I began to apply myself to accommodate my
way of Living, and to make things as easy to me as I could.
I have already described my Habitation, which was a Tent under
the Side of a Rock, surrounded with a strong Pale of Posts and
Cables, but I might now rather call it a Wall, for I raised a kind of
Wall up against it of Turfs, about two Foot thick on the Outside,
and after some time, I think it was a Year and Half, I raised Rafters
from it leaning to the Rock, and thatched or cover'd it with Boughs
of Trees, and such things as I could get to keep out the Rain, which
I found at some times of the Year very violent
I have already obseiVd how I brought all my Goods into this
Pale, and into the Cave which I had made behind me s But I must
observe too, that at first this was a confus'd Heap of Goods, which as
they lay in no Order, so they took up all my Place, I had no room
to turn myself; so I set myself to enlarge my Cave and Works far-
ther into the Earth, for it was a loose sandy Rock, which yielded
easily to the Labour I bestow'd on it: And so when I found I was
pretty safe as to Beasts of Prey, I worked sideways to the Right
Hand into the Rock, and then turning to the Right again, worked
quite out and made me a Door to come out, on the Outside of my
Pale or Fortification.
This gave me not only Egress and Regress, as it were a Back-way
to my Tent and to my Storehouse, but gave me room to stow my
Goods.
And now I began to apply myself to make such necessary things
as I found I most wanted, as particularly a Chair and a Table, for
without these I was not able to enjoy the few Comforts I had in the
World, I could not write, or eat, or do several things with so much
Pleasure without a Table.
So I went to work; and here I must needs observe, that as Reason
is the Substance and Original of the Mathematics, so by stating
and squaring everything by Reason, and by making the most rational
Judgment of things, every Man may be in time Master of every me-
chanic Art I had never handled a Tool in my Life, and yet in
time by Labour, Application, and Contrivance, I found at last that I
wanted nothing but I could have made it, especially if I had had
Tools; however I made abundance of things, even without Tools,
and some with no more Tools than an Adze and a Hatchet, which
perhaps were never made that way before, and that with infinite
Labour: For Example, If I wanted a Board, I had no other Way but
to cut down a Tree, set it on an Edge before me, and hew it flat on
either Side with my Axe, till I had brought it to be thin as a Plank,
and then dubb it smooth with my Adze. It is true, by this Method
1 could make but one Board out of a whole Tree, but this I had no
Remedy for but Patience, any more than I had for the prodigious
deal of Time and Labour which it took me up to make a Plank or
Board: But my Time or Labour was little worth, and so it was as
well employ'd one way as another.
However, I made me a Table and a Chair, as I observ'd above, in
the first Place, and this I did out of the short Pieces of Boards that I
I
ftrought on my Raft from the Ship: But when I had wrought out
some Boards, as above, I made large Shelves of the Breadth of a
Foot and Half one over another, all along one Side of my Cave, to
lay all my Tools, Nails, and Ironwork, and in a Word, to separate
everything at large in their Places, that I might come easily at them;
I knocked Pieces into the Wall of the Rock to hang my Guns and all
things that would hang up.
So that had my Cave been to be seen, it looked like a general
Magazine of all Necessary things, and I had everything so ready at
my Hand, that it was a great Pleasure to me to see all my Goods in
such Order, and especially to find my Stock of all Necessaries so
great
And now it was when I began to keep a Journal of every Day's
Employment, for indeed at first I was in too much Hurry, and not
only Hurry as to Labour, but in too much Discomposure of Mind,
and my Journal would have been full of many dull things: For Example,
I must have said thus. Sept. the 30th. After I got to Shore and had
escap'd drowning, instead of being thankful to God for my Delive-
rance, having first vomited with the great Quantity of salt Watei
which was gotten into my Stomach, and recovering myself a little, I
ran about the Shore, wringing my Hands and beating my Head and
Face, exclaiming at my Misery, and crying out, I was undone, un-
done, till tired and faint I was forced to lie down on the Ground to
repose, but durst not sleep for fear of being devour'd.
Some Days after this, and after I had been on board the Ship, ?nd
got all that I could out of her, yet I could not forbear getting up to
the Top of a little Mountain and looking out to Sea in hopes of
seeing a Ship, then fancy at a vast Distance I spied a Sail, please my-
self with the Hopes of it, and then after looking steadily till I was
almost blind, lose it quite, and sit down and weep like a Child,
and thus increase my Misery by my Folly.
But having gotten over these things in some Measure, and having
settled my household Stuff and Habitation, made me a Table and a
Chair, and all as handsome about me as I could, I began to keep
my Journal, of which I shall here give you the Copy (though in it will
be told all these Particulars over again) as long as it lasted, ftw
having no more Ink I was forced to leave it off
THE JOURNAL.
September 30, 1659. I poor miserable Robinson Crusoe, being ship-
wreck'd, during a dreadful Storm, in the offing, came on Shore on this
dismal unfortunate Island, which I called the Island of Despair, all
the rest of the Ship's Company being drowned, and myself almost
dead.
All the rest of that
Day I spent in af-
flicting myself at the
dismal Circumstan-
ces I was brought
to, viz. I had neither
Food, House,
Clothes, Weapon, or
Place to fly to, and
in Despair of any
Relief, saw noJiing
but Death before me,
either that I should
be devour'd by wild
Beasts, murdered by
Savages, or starved to
Death for Want of
Food. At the Ap-
proach of Night, I slept in a Tree for fear of wild Creatures, but
slept soundly though it rained all Night
October r. In the Morning I saw to my great Surprise the Ship
had floated with the high Tide, and was driven on Shore again much
nearer the Island, which as it was some Comfort on one hand, for
seeing her sit upright, and not broken to Pieces, I hoped, if the Wind
abated, I might get on board, and get some Food and Necessaries
out of her for my Relief; so on the other hand, it renew'd my Grief
at the Loss of my Comrades, who I imagin'd if we had all stayed on
board might have saved the Ship, or at least that they would not have
been all drowned as they were; and that had the Men been saved, we
might perhaps have built us a Boat out of the Ruins of the Ship, to
nave carried us to some other Part of (he World. I spent great Part

fif this Day in perplexing myself on these things; but at length
seeing the Ship almost dry, I went upon the Sand as near as I could,
and then swam on board; this Day also i. continu'd raining, though
with no Wind at all.
From the ist of October to the 24th. All these Days entirely npent
in many several Voyages to get all I could out of the Ship, which I
brought on Shore, every Tide of Flood, upon Rafts. Much Rain
also in these Days, though with some Intervals of fair Weather: But,
it seems, this was the rainy Season.
Oct. 20. I overset my Raft, and all the Goods I had got upon it,
but being in shoal Water, and the tilings being chiefly heavy, I re-
cover'd many of them when the Tide was out
Oct. 35. It rained all Night and all Day, with some Gusts of Wind,
during which time the Ship broke in Pieces, the Wind blowing a little
harder than before, and was no more to be seen, except the Wreck
of her, and that only at low Water. I spent this Day in covering
and securing the Goods which I had saved, that the Rain might
not spoil them.
Oct. 16. I walked about the Shore almost all Day to find out
l place to fix my Habitation, greatly concern'd to secure myself
from an Attack in the Night, either from wild Beasts or Men. To-
wards Night I fixed upon a proper Place under a Rock, and marked
out a Semicircle for my Encampment, which I resolv'd to strengthen
with a Work, Wall, or Fortification made of double Piles, lined within
with Cables, and without with Turfs.
From the 26th to the 30th I worked very hard in carrying all my
Goods to my new Habitation, though some part of the time it rained
exceeding hard.
The 31st in the Morning I went out into the Island with my Gun
to see for some Food, and discover the Country, when I killed a She-
Goat, and her Kid follow'd me home, which I afterwards killed also,
because it would not feed.
November 1. I set up my Tent under a Rock, and lay there for
the first Night, making it as large as I could with Stakes driven in to
swing my Hammock upon.
Nov. 2. I set up all my Chests and Boards, and the Pieces of
Timber which made my Rafts, and with them formed a Fence
round me, a little within the Place I had marked out for my
Fortification.
Nov. 3. I went out with my Gun, and killed two Fowls like
Ducks, which were very good Food . In the Afternoon went to
work to make me a Table.
Nov. 4. This Morning I began to order my times of Work, of
going out with my Gun, time of Sleep, and time of Diversion, viz.
Every Morning I walked out with my Gun for two or three Hours
if it did not rain, then employ'd myself to work till about Eleven',
o'clock, then eat what I had to live on, and from Twelve to Twol,
I lay down to sleep, the Weather being excessive hot, and then in
the Evening to work again: The working Part of this Day and of
the next were wholly employ'd in making my Table, for I was yet
but a very sorry Workman, though Time and Necessity made me a
complete natural Mechanic soon after, as I believe it would do any
one else.
Nov. 3. This Day went abroad with my Gun and my Dog, and
killed a wild Cat, her Skin pretty soft, but her Flesh good for nothing:
Every Creature I killed, I took off the Skins and preserv'd them:
Coming back by the Sea-Shore, I saw many Sorts of Sea-Fowls, which
I did not understand; but was surpriz'd, and almost frighted with
two or three Seals, which, while I was gazing at, not well knowing
what they were, got into the Sea, and escap'd me for that time.
Nov. 6. After my Morning Walk I went to work with my Table
again, and finish'd it, though not to my liking; nor was it long before
I learnt to mend it
Nov. 7. Now it began to be settled fair Weather. The 7th, 8th,
9th, 10th, and part of the 12th, (for the nth was Sunday) I took
wholly up to make me a Chair, and with much ado brought it to a
tolerable Shape, but never to please me, and even in the making I
pulled it in Pieces several times. Note, I soon neglected my keeping . -
Sundays, for omitting my Mark for them on my Post, I forgot which
was which.
Nov. 13. This Day it rained, which refresh'd me exceedingly, and
cooled the Earth, but it was accompany'd with terrible Thunder and
Lightning, which frighted me dreadfully for fear of my Powder; ay
loon as it was over, I resolv'd to separate my Stock of Powder into
as many little Parcels as possible, that it might not be in Danger.
Nov. 14, 15, 16. These three Days I spent in making little square
Chests or Boxes, which might hold about a Pound, or two Pound, at
most, of Powder' and 10 putting the Powder in, I (towed it vs

Places as secure and remote from one another as possible. On one
of these three Days I killed a large Bird that was good to eat, but I
know not what to call it
Nov. 17. This Day I began to dig behind my Tent into the
Rock to make room for my farther Conveniency: Note, Two
Things I wanted exceedingly for
this Work, viz. a Pick-axe, a
Shovel, and a Wheel-barrow or
Basket, so I desisted from my
Work, and began to consider how $LMBbiS»i'>
to supply that Want and make
me some Tools ; as for a Pick-axe,
I made use of the Iron Crows, I \ ii BfcJ&^gt j p^'/i
which were proper enough, though
heavy; but the next thing was a
Shovel or Spade; this was so
absolutely necessary, that indeed
I could do nothing effectually
without it, but what kind of one
to make I knew not
Nov. 18. The next Day in
searching the Woods I found a
Tree of that Wood, or like it, which, in the Brasils they call the Iron
Tree, for its exceeding Hardness, of this, with great Labour and
almost spoiling my Axe, I cut a Piece, and brought it home too with
Difficulty enough, for it was exceeding heavy.
The excessive Hardness of the Wood, and having no other Way,
made me a long while upon this Machine, for I worked it effectually
by little and little into the Form of a Shovel or Spade, the Handle
exactly shaped like ours in England, only that the broad Part having
no Iron shod upon it at Bottom, it would not last me so long, how-
ever it served well enough for the uses which I had occasion to put it
to; but never was a Shovel, I believe, made after that Fashion, or so
long a making.
I was still deficient, for I wanted a Basket or a Wheel-barrow, a
Basket I could not make by any Means, having no such things as
Twigs that would bend to make Wicker Ware, at least none yet found
out; and as to a Wheel-barrow, I fancy'd I could make all but the
Wheel, but that I had no Notion of, neither did I know how to go

about it; besides I had no possible Way to make the Iron Gudgeons
for the Spindle or Axis of the Wheel to run in, so I gave it over, and
so for carrying away the Earth which I dug out of the Cave, I made
me a Thing like a Hod, which the Labourers carry Mortar in, when
they serve the Bricklayers.
This was not so difficult to me as the making the Shovel; and yet
this, and the Shovel, and the Attempt which I made in vain, to make
a Wheel-barrow, took me up no less than four Days, I mean always,
excepting my Morning Walk with my Gun, which-1-seldom failed, and
very seldom failed also bringing Home something fit to eat
Nov. 23. My other Work having now stood still, because of my
making these Tools; when they were finish'd, I went on, and work-
ing every Day, as my Strength and Time aHow'd, I spent eighteen
Days entirely in widening and deepening my Cave, that it might
hold my Goods commodiously.
Note, During all this Time, I worked to make this Room or Cave
spacious enough to accommodate me as a Warehouse or Magazine, a
Kitchen, a Dining-room, and a Cellar; as for my Lodging, I kept to
the Tent, except that Sometimes in the wet Season of the Year, it
rained so hard, that I could not keep myself dry, which caused me
afterwards to cover all my Place within my Pale with long Poles in
the Form of Rafters leaning against the Rock, and load them with
Flags and large Leaves of Trees like a Thatch.
December 10. I began now to think my Cave or Vault finished, when
on a Sudden (it seems I had made it too large) a great Quantity of
Earth fell down from the Top and one Side, so much, that in short it
frighted me, and not without Reason too; for if I had been under
it I had never wanted a Grave-digger: Upon this Disaster I had
a great deal of Work to do over again; for I had the loose
Earth to carry out; and which was of more Importance, I had the
Ceiling to prop up, so that I might be sure no more would come down.
Dec. n. This Day I went to Work with it accordingly, and got
two Shores or Posts pitched upright to the Top, with two Pieces of
Boards across over each Post, this I finished the next Day; and
setting more Posts up with Boards, in about a WeeK more I had the
Roof secur'd; and the Posts standing in Rows, served me for Parti-
tions to part off my House.
Dec. 17. From this Day to the Twentieth I placed Shelves, and
knocked up Nails on the Posts to hang everything up that could be
hung up, and now I began to be in some Order within Doors,
De.. ao. Now I carry'd everything into the Cave, and began to
famish my House, and set up some Pieces of Boards, like a Dresser,
to order my Victual* upon, but Boards began to be very scarce with
me; also I made me another Table.
Dec. 24. Much Rain all Night and all Day, no stirring out
Dec. 25. Rain all Day.
Dec. ao\ No Rain, and the Earth much cooler than before, and
pleasanter.
Dec. 27. Killed a young Goat, and lamed another so that I caught
it and led it Home in a String; when I had it Home, I bound and
splinter'd up its Leg which was broke. N.B. I took such Care of it,
that it lived, and the Leg grew well and as strong as ever; but by my
nursing it so long it grew tame, and fed upon the little Green at my
Door, and would not go away: This was the first Time that I enter-
tain'd a Thought of breeding up some tame Creatures, that I might
have Food when my Powder and Shot was all spent
Dec. 28, 29, 30. Great Heats and no Breeze; so that there was
no Stirring abroad, except in the Evening for Food; this Time I spent
in putting all my Things in Order within Doors.
January 1. Very hot still, but I went abroad early and late with
my Gun, and lay still in the Middle of the Day; this Evening going
farther into the Valleys which lay towards the Centre of the Island,
I found there was plenty of Goats, though exceeding shy and hard to
come at, however I resolv'd to try if I could not bring my Dog to
hunt them down.
Jan. a. Accordingly, the next Day, I went out with my Dog, and
set him upon the Goats; but I was mistaken, for they all faced about
upon the Dog, and he knew his Danger too well, for he would not
come near them.
Jan. 3. I began my Fence or Wall; which being still jealous of my
being attack'd by somebody, I resolv'd to make very thick and strong.
N.B. This Wall being describ'd before, I purposely omit what
was said in the Journal; it is sufficient to observe, that I was
no less Time than from the 3rd of January to the \t,th of
April, working, finishing and perfecting this Wall, though it
was no more than about 24 Yards in Length, being a half-
Circle from one Place in the Rock to another Place about eight
Yards from it, the Door of the Cave being in the Centre b&
Aind*. -
All this Time I worked very hard, the Rains hindering me man;
Days, nay sometimes Weeks together; but I thought I should never
be perfectly secure till this Wall was finished; and it is scarce cre-
dible what inexpressible Labour everything was done with, espe-
cially the bringing Piles out of the Woods, and driving them into the
Ground, for I made them much bigger than I need to have done.
When this Wall was finished, and the Outside double fenced with
a Turf-Wall raised up to close it, I persuaded myself that if any People
were to come on Shore there, they would not perceive anything like
a Habitation; and it was very well I did so, as may be observ'd
hereafter upon a very remarkable Occasion.
During this Time, I made my Rounds in the Woods for Game
every Day when the Rain admitted me, and made frequent Dis-
coveries in these Walks of something or other to my Advantage;
particularly I found a Kind of wild Pigeons, who built not as Wood
Pigeons in a Tree, but rather as House Pigeons, in the Holes of the
Rocks; and taking some young ones, I endeavoured to breed them
up tame, and did so; but when they grew older they flew all away,
which perhaps was at first for Want of feeding them, for I had
nothing to give them; however I frequently found their Nests, and
got their young ones, which were very good Meat
And now, in the managing my household Affairs, I found myself
wanting in many Things, which I thought at first it was impossible
for me to make, as indeed as to some of them it was; for Instance, I
could never make a Cask to be hooped, I had a small Runlet or two,
as I observed before, but I could never arrive to the Capacity of making
one by them, though I spent many Weeks about it; I could neither
put in the Heads, or joint the Staves so true to one another, as to
make them hold Water, so I gave that also over.
In the next Place, I was at a great Loss for Candle; so that as
soon as ever it was dark, which was generally by Seven o'clock,
I was oblig'd to go to Bed: I remembered the Lump of Beeswax
with which I made Candles in my African Adventure, but I
had none of that now; the only Remedy I had was, that when
I had killed a Goat, I saved the Tallow, and with a little Dish made
of Clay, which I baked in the Sun, to which I added a Wick of some
Oakum, I made me a Lamp; and this gave me Light, though not a
clear steady Light like a Candle; in the Middle of all my labours
it happen'd, that rummaging my Things, I found a l'Ule Bag, which,
as 1 hinted before, had been filled with Cor n for the feeding of Poultry,
Dot for this Voyage, but before, as I suppose, when the Ship came from
Lisbon, what little Remainder of Corn had been in the Bag, was all
devour'd with the Rats, and I saw nothing in the Bag but Husks and
Dust; and being willing to have the Bag for some other Use, I think
it was to put Powder in, when I divided it for Fear of the Lightning,
or some such Use, I shook the Husks of Corn out of it on one Side
of my Fortification under the Rock.
It was a little be/ore the great Rains, just now mention'd, that I
threw this Stuff away, taking no Notice of anything, and not so much
as remembering that I had thrown anything there; when about a
Month after, or thereabout, I saw some few Stalks of something
green, shooting out of the Ground, which I fancied might be some
Plant I had not seen, but I was surpris'd and perfectly astonish'd,
when, after a little longer Time, I saw about ten or twelve Ears come
out, which were perfect green Barley of the same Kind as our
European, nay, as our English Barley.
It is impossible to express the Astonishment and Confusion of my
Thoughts on this Occasion; I had hitherto acted upon no religious
Foundation at all, indeed I had very few Notions of Religion in my
Head, or had entertain'd any Sense of anything that had befallen me,
otherwise than as a Chance, or, as we lightly say, what pleases God;
without so much as inquiring into the End of Providence in these
Things, or his Order in governing Events in the World: But after I
saw Barley grow there, in a Climate which I know was not proper for
Corn, and especially that I knew not how it came there, it startled
me strangely, and I began to suggest, that God had miraculously
caused this Grain to grow without any Help of Seed sown, and that it
was so directed purely for my Sustenance, on that wild miserable
Place.
This touched my Heart a little, and brought Tears out of my Eyes,
and I began to bless myself, that such a Prodigy of Nature should
happen upon my Account; and this was the more strange to me, be-
cause I saw near it still all along by the Side of the Rock, some other
straggling Stalks, which proved to be Stalks of Rice, and which I knew,
because I had seen it grow in Africa, when I was ashore there.
I not only thought these the pure Productions of Providence for
my Support, but not doubting, but that there was more in the Place,
I went all over that Part of the Island, where I had been before, peer-
ing In every Corner, and under every Rock, to see for more of it, but
I could not find any; at last it occur'd to my Thoughts, that I had
shook a Bag of Chickens' Meat out in that Place, and then the
Wonder began to cease; and I must confess, my religious Thankful-
ness to God's Providence began to abate too upon the Discovering
that all this was nothing but what was common; though I ought to have
been as thankful for so strange and unforeseen Providence, as if it had
oeen miraculous; for it was really the Work of Providence as to me,
that should order or appoint, that 10 or 12 Grains of Corn should
remain unspoil'd (when the Rats had destroy'd all the rest,) as if it
had been dropped from Heaven; as also, that I should throw it out in
that particular Place, where it being in the Shade of a high Rock, it
sprang up immediately; whereas, if I had thrown it anywhere else, at
that Time, it had been burnt up and destroy'd.
I carefully saved the Ears of this Cor n you may be sure in then-
Season, which was about the End of June; and laying up every Corn,
I resolv'd to sow them all again, hoping in Time to have some
Quantity sufficient to supply me with Bread; But it was not till the
4th Year that I could allow myself the least Grain of this Cor n to
«at, and even then but sparingly, as I shall say afterwards in its
Order; for I lost all that I sowed the first Season, by not observing
the proper Time; for I sowed it just before the dry Season, so that it
never came up at all, at least, not as it would have done: Of which in
its Place.
Besides this Barley, there was, as above, 20 or 30 Stalks of Rice,
which I preserv'd with the same Care, and whose Use was of the
same Kind or to the same Purpose, (viz.) to make me Bread, or
rather Food; for I found Ways to cook it up without baking, though
I did that also after some Time. But to return to my Journal.
I worked excessive hard these three or four Months to get my Wall
done; and the 14th of April I closed it up, contriving to go into it,
/lot by a Door, but over the Wall by a Ladder, that there might be
no Sign in the Outside of my Habitation.
April 16. I finish'd the Ladder, so I went up with the Ladder to
the Top, and then pulled it up after me, and let it down in the Inside:
This was a complete Enclosure to me; for within I had Room
enough, and nothing could come at me from without, unless it could
first mount my Wall
.
The very next Day after this Wall was finish'd, I had almost had
7i
all my Labour overthrown at once, and myself killed, the Case was
thus, As I was busy in the Inside of it, behind my Tent, just in the
Entrance into my Cave, I was terribly frighted with a most dread-
ful surprising Thing indeed; for all on a sudden I found the Earth
come crumbling down from the Roof of my Cave, and from the Edge
of the Hill over my Head, and two of the Posts I had set
up in the Cave cracked in a frightful Manner: I was heartily
scared, but thought nothing of what was really the Cause, only
thinking that the Top of my Cave was falling in, as some of
it had done before; and for Fear I should be buried in it, I
ran forward to my Ladder, and not thinking myself safe there
neither, I got over my Wall for Fear of the Pieces of the Hill which I
expected might roll down upon me: I was no sooner stept down
upon the firm Ground, but I plainly saw it was a terrible Earthquake,
for the Ground I stood on shook three Times at about eight Minutes'
Distance, with three such Shocks, as would have overturn'd the
strongest Building that could be suppos'd to have stood on the Earth,
and a great Piece of the Top of a Rock, which stood about half a
Mile from me next the Sea, fell down with such a terrible Noise, as I
nsver heard in all my Life, I perceiv'd also, the very Sea was put
into violent Motion by it; and I believe the Shocks were stronger
under the Water than on the Island.
I was so amazed with the Thing itself, having never felt the like, or
discours'd with any one that had, that I was like one dead or
stupify'd; and the Motion of the Earth made my Stomach sick like
one that was tossed at Sea; but the Noise of the falling of the Rock
awaked me as it were, and rousing me from the stupify'd Condition I
was in, filled me with Horror, and I thought of nothing then but the
Hill falling upon my Tent and all my household Goods, and burying
all at once; and this sunk my very Soul within me a second Time.
After the third Shock was over, and I felt no more for some Time,
I began to take Courage, and yet I had not Heart enough to go over
my Wall again, for Fear of being buried alive, but sat still upon the
Ground, greatly cast down and disconsolate, not knowing what to do:
All this while I had not the least serious religious Thought, nothing
but the common, Lord have Mercy upon me; and when it was over,
that went away too.
While I sat thus, I found the Air overcast, and grow cloudy, as if it
would Rain; soon after that the Wind rose, by little and little, so that, in
less than half an Hour, it blew a most dreadful Hurricane: The Sea
was all on a Sudden cover'd with Foam and Froth, the Shore was
cover'd with the Breach of the Water, the Trees were torn up by the
Roots, and a terrible Storm it was; and this held about three Hours,
and then began to abate, and in two Hours more it was stark calm,
and began to rain very hard.
All this while I sat upon the Ground very much terrify'd and de-
jected, when on a sudden it came into my thoughts, that these Windi
and Rain being the Consequences of the Earthquake, the Earthquake
itself was spent and over, and I might venture into my Cave again:
With this Thought my Spirits began to revive, and the Rain also
helping to persuade me, I went in and sat down in my Tent, but the
Rain was so violent, that my Tent was ready to be beaten down with
it, and I was forced to go into my Cave, though very much afraid
and uneasy for fear it should fall on my Head.
This violent Rain forced me to a new Work, viz. To cut a Hole
through my new Fortification like a Sink to let the Water go out, which
would else have drowned my Cave. After I had been in my Cave
some time, and found still no more Shocks of the Earthquake follow,
I began to be more compos'd; and now to support my Spirits, which
indeed wanted it very much, I went to my little Store and took a
small Sup of Rum, which however I did then and always very spa-
ringly, knowing I could have no more when that was gone.
It continu'd raining all that Night, and great Part of the next Day,
so that I could not stir abroad, but my Mind being more compos'd, I
began to think of what I had best do, concluding that if the Island
was subject to these Earthquakes, there would be no living for me in
a Cave, but I must consider of building me some little Hut in an
open Place which I might surround with a Wall as I had done here,
and so make myself secure from wild Beasts or Men; but concluded,
if I stayed where I was, I should certainly, one time or other, be
bury'd alive.
With these Thoughts I resolv'd to remove my Tent from the Place
where it stood, which was just under the hanging Precipice of the Hill,
and which, if it should be shaken again, would certainly fall upon my
Tent: And I spent the two next Days, being the 19th and aoth of
April, in contriving where and how to remove my Habitation.
The fear of being swallow' d up alive, made me that I never slept in
quiet, and yet the Apprehensions of lying abroad without any Fence
7J
was almost equal to it; but still when I looked about and saw how
everything was put in order, how pleasantly conceal'd I was, and
how safe from Danger, it made me very loth to remove.
In the meantime it occurr'd to me that it would require a vast
deal of time for me to do this, and that I must be contented to run
the Venture where I was, till I had formed a Camp for myself, and had
secur'd it so as to remove to it: So with this Resolution I compos'd
myself for a time, and resolv'd that I would go to work with all
Speed to build me a Wall with Piles and Cables, &*c, in a Circle as
before, and set my Tent up in it when it was finish'd, but that I
would venture to stay where I was till it was finish'd and fit to re-
move to. This was the 21 st
April 22. The next Morning I began to consider of Means to put
this Resolve in Execution, but I was at a great loss about my Tools;
I had three large Axes and abundance of Hatchets, (for we carried
the Hatchets for Traffic with the Indians) but with much chopping
and cutting knotty hard Wood, they were all full of Notches and
dull, and though I had a Grindstone I could not turn it and grind my
Tools too, this cost me
as much Thought as a
Statesman would have
bestow'd upon a grand
Point of Politics, or
a Judge upon the Life
and Death of a Man.
At length I contriv'd
a Wheel with a String,
to turn it with my
Foot, that I might
have both my Hands
at Liberty: Note, I
had never seen any
such thing in England,
or at least not to take Notice how it was done, though since I have
obseiVd it is very common there; besides that, my Grindstone
was very large and heavy. This Machine cost me a full Week's
Work to bring it to Perfection.
April 28, 29. These two whole Days I took up in grinding my
Tools, my Machine for turning my Grindstone performing very well.

April 30. Having perceiv'd my Bread had been low a great while,
now I took a Survey of it, and reduc'd myself to one Biscuit-cake a
Day, which made my Heart very heavy.
May 1. In, the Morning looking towards the Sea-side, the
Tide being low, I saw something lie on the Shore bigger than
ordinary, and it looked like a Cask, when I came to it, I found a
small Barrel, and two or three Pieces of the Wreck of the Ship, which
were driven on Shore by the late Hurricane, and looking towards
the Wreck itself, I thought it seemed to lie higher out of the Water
than it used to do; I examin'd the Barrel which was driven on Shore,
and soon found it was a Barrel of Gunpowder, but it had taken
Water, and the Powder was caked as hard as a stone, however
I rolled it farther on Shore for the present, and went on upon the
Sands as near as I could to the Wreck of the Ship to look for
more.
When I came down to the Ship I found it strangely remov'd,
The Forecastle, which lay befored bury'd in Sand was heaved up at
least Six Foot, and the Stern, which was broke to Pieces and parted
from the rest by the Force of the Sea soon after I had left rum-
maging her, was tossed, as it were, up, and cast on one Side, and the
Sand was thrown so high on that Side next her Stern, that where-
as there was a great Place of Water before, so that I could not come
within a Quarter of a Mile of the Wreck without swimming, I could
now walk quite up to her when the Tide was out; I was surpris'd
with this at first, but soon concluded it must be done by the Earth-
quake, and as by this Violence the Ship was more broken open than
formerly, so many Things came daily on Shore, which the Sea had
loosen'd, and which the Winds and Water rolled by Degrees to the
Land.
This wholly diverted my Thoughts from the Design of removing
my Habitation; and I busied myself mightily that Day especially, in
searching whether I could make any Way into the Ship, but I found
nothing was to be expected of that Kind, for that all the Inside of
the Ship was choked up with sand: However, as I had learned not
to despair of anything, I resolv'd to pull everything to Pieces that
I could of the Ship, concluding, that everything I got from her
would be of some Use or other to me.
May 3. I began with my Saw, and cut a Piece of a Beam through,
which I thought held some of the upper Part or Quarter-Deck together,
and when I had cut it through, I cleared away the Sand as well
as I could from the Side which lay highest; but the Tide coming
in, I was oblig'd to give over for that Time.
May 4. I went a fishing, but caught not one Fish that I durst eat
of, till I was weary of my Sport, when just going to leave off, I
caught a young Dolphin. I had made me a long Line of some Rope
Yarn, but I had no Hooks, yet I frequently caught Fish enough,
as much as I cared to eat; all which I dried in the Sun, and eat
them dry.
May 5. Worked on the Wreck, cut another Beam asunder, and
brought three great Fir Planks off from the Decks, which I tied to
gether, and made swim on Shore when the Tide of Flood came on.
May 6. Worked on the Wreck, got several Iron Bolts out of her,
and other Pieces of Iron-Work, worked very hard, and came Home
very much tired, and had Thoughts of giving it over.
May 7. Went to the Wreck again, but with an Intent not to
work, but found the Weight of the Wreck had broke itself down, the
Beams being cut, that several Pieces of the Ship seemed to lie loose,
and the Inside of the Hold lay so open, that I could see into it, but
almost full of Water and Sand.
May 8. Went to the Wreck, and carry'd an Iron Crow to wrench
up the Deck, which lay now quite clear of the Water or Sand; I
wrenched open two Planks, and brought them on Shore also with
the Tide: I left the Iron Crow in the Wreck for next Day.
May 9. Went to the Wreck, and with the Crow made Way into
the Body of the Wreck, and felt several Casks, and loosen'd them
with the Crow, but could not break them up; I felt also the Roll of
English Lead, and could stir it, but it was too heavy to remove.
May 10, 11, ia, 13, 14. Went every Day to the Wreck, and got
a great deal of Pieces of Timber, and Boards, or Plank, and 2 or
300 Weight of Iron.
May 15. I carry'd two Hatchets to try if I could not cut a Piece
off of the Roll of Lead, by placing the Edge of one Hatchet, and
driving it with the other; but as it lay about a Foot and a half in the
Water, I could not make any Blow to drive the Hatchet
May 16. It had blowed hard in the Night, and the Wreck ap-
pea^d more broken by the Force of the Water; but I stayed so long
in the Woods to get Pigeons for Food, that the Tide prevented mf
going to the Wreck that Day,
76
ADVENTURES OF
May i j. I saw some Pieces of the Wreck blown on Shore, at a
great Distance, near two Miles off me, but resolv'd to see what they
were, and found it was a Piece of the Head, but too heavy for me to
bring away.
May 24. Every Day to this Day I worked on the Wreck, and with
hard Labour I loosen'd some Things so much with the Crow, that the
first blowing Tide several Casks floated out, and two of the Seamen's
Chests; but the Wind blowing from the Shore, nothing came to
Land that Day, but Pieces of Timber, and a Hogshead which had
some Brazil Pork in it, but the Salt-water and the Sand had
spoiled it
I continu'd this Work every Day to the 15th of June, except the
Time necessary to get Food, which I always appointed, during this
Part of my Employment, to be when the Tide was up, that I might
be ready when it was ebbed out, and by this Time I had gotten Tim-
ber, and Plank, and Iron-Work enough, to have builded a good Boat,
if I had known how; and also, I got at several Times, and in seve-
ral Pieces, near 100 Weight of the Sheet-Lead.
June 16. Going
down to the Sea-side,
I found a large Tor-
toise or Turtle; this
was the first I had
seen, which it seems
was only my Misfor-
tune, not any Defect
of the Place, or
Scarcity; for had I
happen'd to be on
the other Side of the
Island, I might have
had Hundreds of them
every Day, as I found afterwards; but perhaps had paid dear
enough for them.
June 17. I spent in cooking the Turtle; I found in her threescore
Eggs; and her Flesh was to me at that Time the most savoury and
pleasant that ever I tasted in my Life, having had no Flesh, but of
Goats and Fowls, since I landed in this horrid Place.
June 18. Rained all Day, and I stayed within. I thought at this

Time the Rain felt Cold, and I was something chilly, which I knew
was not usual in that Latitude.
June 19. Very ill, and shivering, as if the Weather had been cold.
June 20. No Rest all Night, violent Pains in my Head, and
feverish.
June 2 1. Very ill, frighted almost to Death with the Apprehen-
sions of my sad Condition, to be sick, and no Help : Prayed to GOD
for the first Time since the Storm off of Hull, but scarce knew what
I said, or why; my Thoughts being all confused.
June 21. A little better, but under dreadful Apprehensions of
Sickness.
June 23. Very bad again, cold and shivering, and then a violent
Headache.
June 34. Much better.
June 25. An Ague very violent; the Fit held me seven Hours,
cold Fit and hot, with faint Sweats after it
June 26. Better; and having no Victuals to eat, took my Gun,
but found myself very weak; however I killed a She-Goat, and with
much Difficulty got it Home, and broiled some of it, and eat; I would
fain have stewed it, and made some Broth, but had no Pot
June 27. The Ague again so violent, that I lay a-Bed all Day, and
neither eat or drank. I was ready to perish for Thirst, but so weak,
I had not Strength to stand up, or to get myself any Water to drink:
Prayed to God again, but was light-headed, and when I was not, I was
so ignorant, that I knew not what to say; only I lay and cried, Lord
look upon me, Lord pity me, Lord have Mercy upon me: I suppose I
did nothing else for two or three Hours, till the Fit wearing off, I fell
asleep, and did not wake till far in the Night; when I waked, I found
myself much refresh'd, but weak, and exceeding thirsty: However,
as I had no Water in my whole Habitation, I was forced to lie till
Morning, and went to sleep again: In this second Sleep, I had
this terrible Dream.
I thought, that I was sitting on the Ground on the Outside of my
Wall, where I sat when the Storm blew after the Earthquake, and that
I saw a Man descend from a great black Cloud, in a bright Flame of
Fire, and light upon the Ground: He was all over as bright as a
Flame, so that I could but just bear to look towards him; his Counte-
nance was most inexpressibly dreadful, impossible for Words to
describe; when he stepped upon the Ground with his Feet, I thought
the Earth trembled, just as it had done before in the Earthquake,
and all the Air looked, to my Apprehension, as if it had been filled
with Flashes of Fire.
He was no sooner landed upon the Earth, but he moved forward to-
wards me, with a long Spear or Weapon in his Hand, to kill me; and
when he came to a rising Ground, at some Distance, he spoke to me,
or I heard a Voice so terrible, that it is impossible to express the
Terror of it; all that I can say, I understood, was this, Seeing all
tIuse Things have not brought thee to Repentance, now thou shalt die:
At which Words, I thought he lifted up the Spear that was in his
Hand, to kill me.
No one, that shall ever read this Account, will expect that I
should be able to describe the Horrors of my Scul »t this terrible
Vision, I mean, that even while it was a Dream, I even dreamed of
those Horrors; nor is it any more possible to describe the Impres-
sion that remain'd upon my Mind when I awak'd and found it was
but a Dream.
I had alas! no divine Knowledge; what I had received by the
good Instruction of my Father was then worn out by an uninterrupted
Series, for 8 Years, of Seafaring Wickedness, and a constant Conversa-
tion with nothing but such as were like myself, wicked and profane
to the last Degree: I do not remember that I had in all that Time
one Thought that so much as tended either to looking upwards toward
God, or inwards towards a Reflection upon my own Ways: But a
certain Stupidity of Soul, without Desire of Good, or Conscience of
Evil, had entirely overwhelm'd me, and I was all that the most
hardened, unthinking, wicked Creature among our common Sailors,
can be supposed to be, not having the least Sense, either of the Fear
of God in Danger, or of Thankfulness to God in Deliverances.
In the relating what is already past of my Story, this will be the
more easily believ'd, when I shall add, that through all the Variety of
Miseries that had to this Day befallen me, I never had so much as one
Thought of it being the Hand of God, or that it was a just Punish-
ment for my Sin; my rebellious Behaviour against my Father, or my
present Sins which were great; or so much as a Punishment for the
general Course of my wicked Life. When I was on the desperate
Expedition on the desert Shores of Africa, I never had so much as
one Thought of what would become of me; or one Wish to God to
direct me whither I should go, or to keep me from the Danger which
apparently surrounded me, as well from voracious Creatures as
cruel Savages: But I was merely thoughtless of a God, or a Provi-
dence; acted like a mere Brute from the Principles of Nature,
and by the Dictates of common Sense only, and indeed hardly
that
When I was deliver^ and taken up at Sea by the Portugal Captain,
well used, and dealt justly and honourably with, as well as charitably,
I had not the least Thankfulness on my Thoughts : When again I was
shipwreck'd, ruined, and in Danger of drowning on this Island, I was
as far from Remorse, or looking on it as a Judgment; I only said to
myself often, that I was an unfortunate Dog, and born to be always
miserable.
It is true, when I got on Shore first here, and found all my Ship's
Crew drowned, and myself spared, I was surpris'd with a Kind of
Ecstasy, and some Transports of Soul, which, had the Grace of God
assisted, might have come up to true Thankfulness; but it ended
where it begun, in a mere common Flight of Joy, or as I may say,
being glad I was alive, without the least Reflection upon the dis-
tinguishing Goodness of the Hand which had preserv'd me, and
had singled me out to be preserv'd, when all the rest were destroy'd;
or an Inquiry why Providence had been thus merciful to me; even
just the same common Sort of Joy which Seamen generally have after
they are got safe ashore from a Shipwreck, which they drown all in
the next Bowl of Punch, and forget almost as soon as it is over, and
all the rest of my Life was like it
Even when I was afterwards, on due Consideration, made sensible
of my Condition, how I was cast on this dreadful Place, out of the
Reach of human Kind, out of all Hope of Relief, or Prospect of
Redemption, as soon as I saw but a Prospect of living, and that I
should not starve and perish for Hunger, all the Sense of my Afflic-
tion wore off, and I begun to be very easy, applied myself to the
Works proper for my Preservation and Supply, and was far enough
from being afflicted at my Condition, as a Judgment from Heaven,
or as the Hand of God against me; these were Thoughts which very
seldom enter'd into my Head.
The growing up of the Corn, as is hinted in my Journal, had at
first some little Influence upon me, and began to affect me with
Seriousness, as long as I thought it had something miraculous in it;
but as soon as ever that Fart of the Thought was remov'd, all the Inv
pression which was raised from it, wore off also, as I have noted
already.
Even the Earthquake, though nothing could be more terrible in its
Nature, or more immediately directing to the invisible Power which
alone directs such Things, yet no sooner was the first Fright over, but
the Impression it had made went off also. I had no more Sense of
God or his Judgments, much less of the present Affliction of my
Circumstances being from his Hand, than if I had been in the most
prosperous Condition of Life.
But now when I began to be sick, and a leisurely View of the
Miseries of Death came to place itself before me; when my Spirits
began to sink under the Burden of a strong Distemper, and Nature
was exhausted with the Violence of the Fever; Conscience that had
slept so long, begun to awake, and I began to reproach myself with
my past Life, in which I had so evidently, by uncommon Wickedness,
provok'd the Justice of God to lay me under uncommon Strokes, and
to deal with me in so vindictive a Manner.
These Reflections oppress'd me for the second or third Day of my
Distemper, and in the Violence, as well of the Fever, as of the
dreadful Reproaches of my Conscience, extorted some Words from
me, like praying to God, though I cannot say they were either a
Prayer attended with Desires or with Hopes; it was rather the Voice
of mere Fright and Distress; my Thoughts were confus'd, the Con-
victions grew upon my Mind, and the Horror of dying in such a
miserable Condition raised Vapours into my Head with the mere
Apprehensions; and in these Hurries of my Soul, I know not what
my Tongue might express; but it was rather Exclamation, such as,
Lord! what a miserable Creature am I? If I should be sick, I shall
certainly die for Want of Help, and what will become of me 1 Then
the Tears burst out of my Eyes, and I could say no more for a
good while.
In this Interval, the good Advice of my Father came to my Mind,
and presently his Prediction which I mention'd at the Beginning of
this Story, viz. That if I did take this foolish Step, God would not
bless me, and I would hax t Leisure hereafter to reflect upon having neg-
lected his Counsel, when there might be none to assist in my Recovery.
Now, said I aloud, My dear Father's Words are come to pass: God'i
Justice has overtaken me, and I have none to help or hear me: I
rejected the Voice of Providence, which had mercifully put me in a
Posture or Station of Life, wherein I might have been happy and
easy; but I would neither see it myself, or learn to know the Blessing
of it from my Parents; I left them to mourn over my Folly, and now
I am left to mour n under the Consequences of it: I refus'd their
Help and Assistance who would have lifted me into the World, and
would have made everything easy to me, and now I have Difficulties
to struggle with, too great for even Nature itself to support, and no
Assistance, no Help, no Comfort, no Advice; then I cried out,
Lord be my Help, for I am in great Distress.
This was the first Prayer, if I may call it so, that I had made for
many Years: But I return to my Journal.
June 28. Having been somewhat refresh'd with the Sleep I had
had, and the Fit being entirely off, I got up; and though the Fright
and Terror of my Dream was very great, yet I consider'd, that the
Fit of the Ague would return again the next Day, and now was my
Time to get something to refresh and support myself when I should
be ill; and the first Thing I did, I filled a large square Case Bottle
with Water, and set it upon my Table, in Reach of my Bed; and to
take off the chill or aguish Disposition of the Water, I put about a
Quarter of a Pint of Rum into it, and mixed them together; and then
I got me a Piece of the Goat's Flesh, and broiled it on the Coals, but
could eat very little; I walked about, but was very weak, and withal
very sad and heavy-hearted in the Sense of my miserable Condition;
dreading the Return of my Distemper the next Day; at Night I made
my Supper of three of the Turtle's Eggs, which I roasted in the Ashes,
and eat, as we call it, in the Shell; and this was the first Bit of Meat I
had ever asked God's Blessing to, even as I could remember, in my
whole Life.
After I had eater, I tried to walk, but found myself so weak, that I
could hardly carry the Gun, (for I never went out without that) so I
went but a little Way, and sat down upon the Ground, looking out
upon the Sea, which was just before me, and very calm and smooth:
As I sat here, some such Thoughts as these occurred to me.
What is this Earth and Sea of which I have seen so much, whence
is it produc'd, and what am I, and all the other Creatures, wild and
tame, human and brutal, whence are we?
Sure we are all made by some secret Power, who formed the Earth
and Sea, the Air and Sky; and who is that?
Then it follow'd most naturally, It is God that has made it all:
Well, but then it came on strangely, if God has made all these Things,
He guides and governs them all, and all Things that concern them;
for the Power that could make all Things, must certainly have Power
to guide and direct them.
If so, nothing can happen in the great Circuit of his Works,
either without his Knowledge or Appointment
And if nothing happens without his Knowledge, he knows that I
am here, and am in this dreadful Condition; and if nothing happens
without his Appointment, he has appointed all this to befal me.
Nothing occurr'd to my Thought to contradict any of these Con-
clusions; and therefore it rested upon me with the greater Force,
that it must needs be, that God had appointed all this to befal me;
that I was brought to this miserable Circumstance by his Direction,
he having the sole Power, not of me only, but of everything that
happen'd in the World. Immediately it follow'd,
Why has God done this to me? What have I done to be thus used 1
My Conscience presently checked me in that Inquiry, as if I had blas-
phem'd, and methought it spoke to me like a Voice; WRETCH I
dost thou ask what thou hast doneI look back upon a dreadful mis-
spent Life, and ask thyself what thou hast not done? ask, Why is it
that thou wert not long ago destroy'dl Why wert thou not drowned in
Yarmouth Roads? Killed in the Fight when the Ship was taken by the
Sallee Man of War? Devour'd by the wild Beasts on the Coast of
Africa? Or, Drowned HERE, when all the Crew perished but thyself?
Dost thou ask, What have 1done?
I was struck dumb with these Reflections, as one astonish'd, and
had not a Word to say, no not to answer to myself, but rose up pen-
sive and sad, walked back to my Retreat, and went up over my Wall,
as if I had been going to Bed, but my Thoughts were sadly dis-
turb'd, and I had no Inclination to Sleep; so I sat down in my
Chair, and lighted my Lamp, for it began to be dark: Now as the
Apprehension of the Return of my Distemper terrify'd me very much,
it occurr'd to my Thought, that the Brasilians take no Physic but
their Tobacco, for almost all Distempers; and I had a Piece of a
Roll of Tobacco in one of the Chests, which was quite cured, and
some also that was green and not quite cured.
I went, directed by Heaven no doubt; for in this Chest I found a
Cure, both for Soul and Body, I open'd the Chest,(and found what I
looked for, via. the Tobacco; and as the few Books I had saved, \ay
there too, I took out one of the Bibles which I mention'd before, and
which to this Time I had not found Leisure, or so much as Inclina-
tion to look into; I say, I took it out, and brought both that and the
Tobacco with me to the Table.
What Use to make of the Tobacco, I knew not, as to my Distem-
per, or whether it was good for it or no; but I tried several Experi-
ments with it, as if I was resolv'd it should hit one Way or other:
I first took a Piece of a Leaf, and chewed it in my Mouth, which
indeed at first almost stupified my Brain, the Tobacco being
green and strong, and that I had not been much used to it; then I
took some and steeped it an Hour or two in some Rum, and resolv'd
to take a Dose of it when I lay down; and lastly, I burnt some
upon a Pan of Coals, and held my Nose close over the Smoke of it as
long as I could bear it, as well for the Heat as almost for Suffocation.
In the Interval of this Operation, I took up the Bible and began
to read, but my Head was too much disturb'd with the Tobacco to
bear reading, at least that Time; only having open'd the Book
casually, the first Words that occurr'd to me were these, Call on ml
ix the Day of Trouble, and I will deliver, and thou shalt glorify me.
The Words were very apt to my Case, and made some Impression
upon my Thoughts at the Time of reading them, though not so much
as they did afterwards; for as for being deliver'd, the Word had no
Sound, as I may say, to me; the Thing was so remote, so impos-
sible in my Apprehension of Things, that I began to say as the Chil-
dren of Israel did, when they were promis'd Flesh to eat, Can God
tpread a Table in the Wilderness? so I began to say, can God himself
deliver me from this Place? and as it was not for many Years that
any Hope appear'd, this prevail'd very often upon my Thoughts : But
however, the Words made a great Impression upon me, and I mused
upon them very often. It grew now late, and the Tobacco had, as I
said, dosed my Head so much, that I inclin'd to sleep; so I left my
Lamp burning in the Cave, lest I should want anything in the
Night, and went to Bed; but before I lay down, I did what I never
had done in all my Life, I kneeled down and prayed to God to fulfil
the Promise to me, that if I called upon him in the Day of Trouble,
he would deliver me; after my broken and imperfect Prayer was
over, I drunk the Rum in which I had steeped the Tobacco, which
was so strong and rank of the Tobacco, that indeed I could scarce
get it down; immediately upon this I went to Bed. I found
presently it flew up in my Head violently, but I fell into a sound
Sleep, and waked no more 'till by the Sun it must necessarily be near
Three o'Clock in the Afternoon the next Day; nay, to this Hour I am
partly of the Opinion, that I slept all the next Day and Night, and
till almost Three that Day after; for otherwise I knew not how I
should lose a Day out of my Reckoning in the Days of the Week,
as it appear'd some Years after I had done; for if I had lost it by
crossing and recrossing the Line, I should have lost more than one
Day: But certainly I lost a Day in my Account, and never knew
which Way.
Be that however one Way or the other, when I awak'd I found my-
self exceedingly refresh'd, and my Spirits lively and cheerful; when
I got up, I was stronger than I was the Day before, and my
Stomach better, for I was hungry; and in short, I had no Fit the
next Day, but continu'd much alter'd for the better; this was the 29th.
The 30th was my well-Day of Course, and I went abroad with my
Gun, but did not care to travel too far, I killed a Sea Fowl or two,
something like a brand Goose, and brought them Home, but was
not very forward to eat them: so I ate some more of the Turtle's
Eggs, which were very good: This Evening I renew'd the Medicine
which I had suppos'd did me good the Day before, viz. the Tobacco
steeped in Rum, only I did not take so much as before, nor did I
chew any of the Leaf, or hold my Head over the Smoke; however,
I was not so well the next Day, which was the first of July, as I hoped
I should have been; for I had a little Spice of the cold Fit, but it
was not much.
July 2. I renew'd the Medicine all the three Ways, and dosed
myself with it as at first; and doubled the Quantity which I drank.
3. I missed the Fit for good and all, though [ did not recover my
full Strength for some Weeks after; while I was thus gathering
Strength, my Thoughts run exceedingly upon this Scripture, / will
deliver thee, and the Impossibility of my Deliverance lay much upon my
Mind in Bar of my ever expecting it: But as I was discouraging myself
with such Thoughts, it occurr'd to my Mind, that I pored so much
upon my Deliverance from the main Affliction, that I disregarded
the Deliverance I had receiv'd; and I was, as it were, made to
ask myself such Questions as these, viz. Have I not been deliver'd,
and wonderfully too, from Sickness? from the most distress'd Con-
dition that could be-, and that was so frightful to me. and what
ClilS'iE KFAUINU THIS SCKHTURES.—P. 85.
Notice I had taken of it: Had I done my Part, God had deliver'd me,
kut I had not glorify d him; that is to say, I had not owned and been
thankful for that as a Deliverance, and how could I expect greater
Deliverance.
This touched my Heart very much, and immediately I kneeled
down and gave God Thanks aloud, for my Recovery from my Sick
ness.
July 4. In the Morning I took the Bible, and beginning at the New
Testament, I began seriously to read it, and impos'd upon myself
to read a while every Morning and every Night, not tying myself to
the Number of Chapters, but as long as my Thoughts should engage
me: It was not long after I set seriously to this Work, but I found
my Heart more deeply and sincerely affected with the Wickedness of
my past Life: The Impression of my Dream reviv'd, and the Words,
All these Things have not brought thee to Repentance, ran seriously in my
Thought: I was earnestly begging of God to giv.e me Repentance,
when it happen'd providentially the very Day that reading the
Scripture, I came to these Words, He is exalted a Prince and a Saviour,
to give Repentance, and to give Remission: I threw down the Book, and
with my Heart as well as my Hands lifted to Heaven, in a Kind ol
Ecstasy of Joy, I cried out aloud, Jesus, thou Son of David, Jesus,
thou exalted Prince and Saviour, give me Repentance I
This was the first Time that I could say, in the true Sense of the
Words, that I prayed in all my Life; for now I prayed with a Sense
of my Condition, and with a true Scripture View of Hope founded
on the Encouragement of the Word of God; and from this Time,
I may say, I began to have Hope that God would hear me.
Now I began to construe the Words mentioned above, Call on me,
and I will deliver you, in a different Sense from what I had ever done
before; for then I had no Notion of anything being called Deliver-
ance, but my being deliver'd from the Captivity I was in; for though
I was indeed at large in the Place, yet the Island was certainly a
Prison to me, and that in the worst Sense in the World; but now 1
learned to take it in another Sense: Now I looked back upon my
past Life with such Horror, and my Sins appear'd so dreadful, that
my Soul sought nothing of God, but Deliverance from the Load of Guilt
that bore down all my Comfort: As for my solitary Life it was no-
thing; I did not so much as pray to be deliver'd from it, or think of
it; It was all of no Consideration in Comparison to this: And I add
this Part here, to hint to whoever shall read it, that whenever they
come to a true Sense of things, they will find Deliverance from Sin a
much greater Blessing, than Deliverance from Affliction.
But leaving this Part, I return to my Journal
My Condition began now to be, though not less miserable as to my
Way of living, yet much easier to my Mind; fend my Thoughts being
directed, by a constant reading the Scripture, and praying to God,
to things of a higher Nature: I had a great deal of Comfort within,
which till now I knew nothing of; also, as my Health and Strength
returned, I bestirr'd myself to furnish myself with everything that I
wanted, and make my Way of living as regular as I could.
From the 4th of July to the 14th, I was chiefly employ'd in walk-
ing about with my Gun in my Hand, a little and a little, at a Time,
as a Man that was gathering up his Strength after a Fit of Sickness:
For it is hardly to be imagin'd, how low I was, and to what Weak-
ness I was reduc'd. The Application which I made Use of was per-
fectly new, and perhaps what had never cured an Ague before, neither
can I recommend it to anyone to practise, by this Experiment; and
though it did carry off the Fit, yet it rather contributed to weakening
me; for I had frequent Convulsions in my Nerves and Limbs for
some Time.
I learnt from it also this in particular, that being abroad in the
rainy Season was the most pernicious thing to my Health that could be,
especially in those Rains which came attended with Storms and
Hurricanes of Wind; for as the Rain which came in the dry Season
was always most accompany'd with such Storms, so I found that
Rain was much more dangerous than the Rain which fell in Septem-
ber and October.
I had been now in this unhappy Island above 10 Months, all
Possibility of Deliverance from this Condition, seemed to be entirely
taken from me ; and I firmly believed, that no human Shape had ever
set Foot upon that Place: Having now secur'd my Habitation, as I
thought, fully to my Mind, I had a great Desire to make a va.au
perfect Discovery of the Island, and to see what other Productions I
might find, which I yet knew nothing of.
It was the 15th of July that I began to take a more particular
Survey of the Island itself: I went up the Creek first, where, as I
hinted, I brought my Rafts on Shore; I found after I came about
two Miles up, that the Tide did not flow any higher, and that it was
no more than a little Brook of running Water, and ver> fresh and
good; but this being the dry Season, there was hardly any Water in
some Parts of it, at least, not enough to run in any Stream, so as it
could be perceiv'd.
On the Bank of this Brook I found may pleasant Savartas, or
Meadows; plain, smooth, and cover'd with Grass; and on the rising
Parts of them next to the higher Grounds, where the Water, as it
might be supposed, never overflow'd, I found a great deal of Tobacco,
green, and growing to a great and very strong Stalk; there were
divers other Plants which I had no Notion of, or Understanding
about, and might perhaps have Virtues of their own, which I could
not find out
I searched for the Cassava Root, which the Indians in all that
Climate make their Bread of, but I could find none. I saw large
Plants of Aloes, but did not then understand them. I saw several
Sugar Canes, but wild, and for want of Cultivation, imperfect I con-
tented myself with these Discoveries for this Time, and came back
musing with myself what Course I might take to know the Virtue and
Goodness of any of the Fruits or Plants which I should discover; but
could bring it to no Conclusion; for in short, I had made so little
Observation while I was in the Brasils, that I knew little of the
Plants in the Field, at least very little that might serve me to any
Purpose now in my Distress.
The next Day, the 16th, I went up the same Way again, and after
going something farther than I had gone the Day before, I found the
Brook, and the Savanas began to cease, and the Country became
more woody than before; in this Part I found different Fruits, and
particularly I found Melons upon the Ground in great Abundance,
and Grapes upon the Trees; the Vines had spread indeed over the
Trees, and the Clusters of Grapes were just now in their Prime, very
ripe and rich: This was a surprising Discovery, and I was exceeding
glad of them; but I was warned by my Experience to eat sparingly
of them, remembering that when I was ashore in Barbary, the eating
of Grapes killed several of our English Men who were Slaves there,
by throwing them into Fluxes and Fevers: But I found an excellent
Use for these Grapes, and that was to cure or dry them in the Sun,
and keep them as dried Grapes or Raisins are kept, which I thought
would be, as indeed they were, as wholesome as agreeable to eat
when no Grapes might be to be had.
I spent all that Evening there, and went not back to my Habita-
tion, which by the Way was the first Night, as I might say, I had lain
from Home. In the Night I took my first Contrivance, and got up
into a Tree, where I slept
well, and the next Morning
proceeded upon my Discovery,
travelling near four Miles, am
I might judge by the Length
of the Valley, keeping still due
North, with a Ridge of Hills
on the South and North side
of ine.
At the End of this March 1
came to an Opening, where
the Country seemed to de-
scend to the West, and a
little Spring of fresh Water,
which issued out of the Side
of the Hill by me, run the
other Way, that is due East;
and the Country appear'd so
fresh, so green, so flourishing,
everything being in a con-
stant Verdure, or Flourish ol
Spring, that it looked like a
planted Garden.
I descended a little on the
Side of that delicious Vale,
surveying it with a secret
Kind of Pleasure, (though
mixed with my other afflicting
Thoughts) to think that this
was all my own, that I was
King and Lord of all this
Country indefeasibly, and had
» Right of Possession; and if I could convey it, I might have it in
Inheritance, as completely as any Lord of a Manor in England. I saw
here Abundance of Cocoa Trees, Orange, and Lemon, and Citron
Trees; but all wild and very few bearing any Fruit, at least not then:

However, the green Limes that I gathered, were not only pleasant
to eat, but very wholesome ; and I mixed their Juice afterwards with
Water, which made it very wholesome, and very cool, and re-
freshing.
I found now I had Business enough to gather and carry Home;
and I resolv'd to lay up a Store, as well of Grapes, as Limes and
Lemons, to furnish myself for the wet Season, which I knew was ap-
proaching.
In Order to this, I gather'd a great Heap of Grapes in one Place,
and a lesser Heap in another Place, and a great Parcel of Limes and
Lemons in another Place; and taking a few of each with me, I
travell'd homeward, and resolv'd to come again, and bring a Bag or
Sack, or what I could make to carry the rest Home.
Accordingly, having spent three Days in this Journey, I came
Home; so I must now call my Tent and my Cave: But, before I got
thither, the Grapes were spoiled, the Richness of the Fruits, and the
Weight of the Juice having broken them, and bruised them, they
were good for little or nothing; as to the Limes, they were good, but
I could bring but a few.
The next Day, being the 19th, I went back, having made me two
small Bags to bring Home my Harvest: But I was surpris'd, when
coming to my Heap of Grapes, which were so rich and fine when I
gather'd them, I found them all spread about, trod to Pieces; and
dragged about, some here, some there, and Abundance eaten and
devour'd: By this I concluded, there were some wild Creatures there-
abouts, which had done this; but what they were, I knew not
However, as I found there was no laying them up on Heaps,
and no carrying them away in a Sack, but that one Way they would
be desrroy'd, and the other Way they would be crushed with their
own Weight, I took another Course; for I gather'd a large Quantity
of the Grapes, and hung them up upon the out Branches of the Trees,
that they might cure and dry in the Sun; and as for the Limes and
Lemons, I carried as many back as I could well stand under.
When I came Home from this Journey, I contemplated with great
Pleasure the Fruitfulness of that Valley, and the Pleasantness of the
Situation, the Security from Storms on that Side the Water, and the
Wood, and concluded, that I had pitched upon a Place to fix my
Abode, which was by far the worst Part of the Country. Upon the
Whole I began to consider of removing my Habitation; and to look
out for a Place equally safe, as where I now was situate, if possible, in
that pleasant fruitful Part of the Island.
This Thought run long in my Head, and I was exceeding fond of
it for some Time, the Pleasantness of the Place tempting me; but
when I came to a nearer View of it, and to consider that I was now
by the Sea-Side, where it was at least possible that something might
happen to my Advantage, and by the same ill Fate that brought me
hither, might bring some other unhappy Wretches to the same Place;
and though it was scarce probable that any such Thing should ever
happen, yet to enclose myself among the Hills and Woods, in the
Centre of the Island, was to anticipate my Bondage, and to render
such an Affair not only Improbable, but Impossible; and that there-
fore I ought not by any Means to remove.
However, I was so Enamour'd of this Place, that I spent much of
my Time there, for the whole remaining Part of the Month of July;
and though upon second Thoughts I resolv'd as above, not to remove,
yet I built me a little kind of a Bower, and surrounded it at a Distance
with a strong Fence, being a double Hedge, as high as I could reach,
well staked, and filled between with Brushwood; and here I lay very
secure, sometimes two or three Nights together, always going over it
with a Ladder, as before; so that I fancied now I had my Country
House, and my Sea-Coast House: And this Work took me up to the
Beginning of August.
I had but newly finish'd my Fence, and began to enjoy my Labour,
but the Rains came on, and made me stick close to my first Habita-
tion ; for though I had made me a Tent like the other, with a Piece of
a Sail, and spread it very well; yet I had not the Shelter of a Hill to
keep me from Storms, nor a Cave behind me to retreat into, when
the Rains were extraordinary.
About the Beginning of August, as I said, I had finish'd my Bower,
and began to enjcy myself. The third of August, I found the Grapes
I had hung up were perfectly dried, and indeed, were excellent good
Raisins of the Sun; so I began to take them down from the Trees, and
it was very happy that I did so; for the Rains which follow'd would
have spoiled them, and I had lost the best Part of my Winter Food;
for I had above two hundred large Bunches of them. No sooner had
I taken them all down, and carried most of them Home to my Cave,
but it began to rain, and from hence, which was the fourteenth of
August, it rained more or less, every Day, till the middle of October;
9«
and sometimes so violently, that I could not stir out of my cave for
several Days.
In this Season I was much surpris'd with the Increase of my
Family; I had been concern'd for the Loss of one of my Cats, who
run away from me, or as I thought had been dead, and I heard no
more Tale or Tidings of her, till to my Astonishment she came
Home about the End of August, with three Kittens; this was the
more strange to ma, because though I had killed a wild Cat, as I
called it, with my Gun; yet I thought it was a quite differing Kind
from our European Cats; yet the voung Cats were the same Kind of

House breed like the old one; and both my Cats being Females, I
thought it very strange: But from these three Cats, I afterwards came
to be so pester'd with Cats, that I was forced to kill them like Vermin,
or wild Beasts, and to drive them from my House as much as
possible.
From the fourteenth of August to the twenty-sixth, incessant Rain,
to that I could not stir, and was now very careful not to be much
wet In this Confinement I began to be straitened for Food,
but venturing out twice, I one Day killed a Goat, and the last Day,
which was the twenty-^ixth, found a very large Tortoise, which was a
Treat to me, and my Food was regulated thus; I eat a Bunch of
Raisins for my Breakfast, a Piece of the Goat's Flesh, or of the Turtle
for my Dinner broiled; for to mygreat Misfortune, I had no Vessel to boil
or stew anything; and two or three of the Turtle's Eggs for my Supper.
During this Confinement in my Cover, by the Rain, I worked daily
two or three Hours at enlarging my Cave, and by Degrees worked it
on towards one Side, till I came to the Outside of the Hill, and made
a Door or Way out, which came beyond my Fence or Wall, and so I
came in and out this Way; but I was not perfectly easy at lying so
open; for as I had managed myself before, I was in a perfect Enclo-
sure, whereas now I thought I lay expos'd, and open for anything to
come in upon me; and yet I could not perceive that there was any
living Thing to fear, the biggest Creature that I had yet seen upon
the Island being a Goat
September the thirtieth, I was now come to the unhappy Anniver-
sary of my Landing. I cast up the Notches on my Post, and found
I had been on Shore three hundred and sixty-five Days. I kept this
Day as a Solemn Fast, setting it apart to Religious Exercise, prostrat-
ing myself on the Ground with the most serious Humiliation, confess*
ing my Sins to God, acknowledging his Righteous Judgments upon me,
and praying to him to have Mercy on me, through Jesus Christ; and
having not tasted the least Refreshment for twelve Hours, even till
the going down of the Sun, I then eat a Biscuit Cake, and a Bunch
of Grapes, and went to Bed, finishing the Day as I began it
I had all this Time observ'd no Sabbath-Day; for as at first I had
no Sense of Religion upon my Mind, I had after some Time omitted
to distinguish the Weeks, by making a longer Notch than ordinary
for the Sabbath-Day, and so did not really know what any of the Days
were; but now having cast up the Days, as above, I found I had
been there a Year; so I divided it into Weeks, and set apart every
seventh Day for a Sabbath; though I found at the End of my Ac-
count I had lost a Day or two in my Reckoning.
A little after this my Ink began to fail me, and so I contented my-
self to use it more sparingly, and to write down only the most re-
markable Events of my Life, without continuing a daily Memorandum
of other Things.
The rainy Season, and the dry Season, began now to appear regu-
lar to me, and I learnt to divide them so, as to provide for them ac-
cordingly. But I bought all my Experience before I had it; and
this I am going to relate, was one of the most discouraging Experi-
ments that I made at all: I have mention'd that I had saved the few
Ears of Barley and Rice, which I had so surprisingly found spring up,
as I thought, of themselves, and believe there were about thirty Stalks
of Rice, and about twenty of Barley; and now I thought it a proper
Time to sow it after the Rains, the Sun being in its Southern Position
going from me.
Accordingly I dug up a Piece of Ground as well as I could with
my wooden Spade, and dividing it into two Parts, I sowed my Grain;
but as I was sowing, it casually occurr'd to my Thoughts, That I
would not sow it all at first, because I did not know when was the
proper Time for it; so I sowed about two Thirds of the Seed, leaving
about a Handful of each.
It was a great Comfort to me afterwards, that I did so, for not one
Grain of that sowed this Time came to anything; for the dry Months
following, the Earth having had no Rain after the Seed was sown, it
had no Moisture to assist its Growth, and never came up at all, till
the wet Season had come again, and then it grew as if it had been
but newly sown.
Finding my first Seed did not grow, which I easily imagin'd was by
the Drought, I sought for a moister Piece of Ground to make
another Trial in, and I dug up a Piece of Ground near my new Bower,
and sowed the rest of my Seed in February, a little before the Vernal
Equinox; and this having the rainy Months of March and April to
water it, sprung up very pleasantly, and yielded a very good Crop;
but having Part of the Seed left only, and not daring to sow all that I
had, I had but a small Quantity at last, my whole Crop not amounting
to above half a Peck of each kind.
But by this Experiment I was made Master of my Business, and
knew exactly when the proper Season was to sow; and that I might
expect two Seed Times, and two Harvests every Year.
While this Cor n was growing, I made a little Discovery which was
of use to me afterwards: As soon as the Rains were over, and the
Weather began to settle, which was about the Month of November, I
made a Visit up the Country to my Bower, where though 1 had not
been some Months, yet I found all Things just as I left them. The
Circle or double Hedge that I had made, was not only firm and en-
tire; but the Stakes which I had cut out of some Trees that grew
{hereabouts, were all shot out and grown with long Branches, as much
as a Willow-Tree usually shoots the first Year after lopping its Head
I could not tell what Tree to call it, that these Stakes were cut from.
I was surpris'd, and yet very well pleased, to see the young Trees grow;
and I pruned them, and led them up to grow as much alike as I
could; and it is scarce credible how beautiful a Figure they grew into
in three Years; so that though the Hedge made a Circle of about
twenty-five Yards in Diameter, yet the Trees, for such I might now
call them, soon cover'd it; and it was a complete Shade, sufficient
'jo lodge under all the dry Season.
This made me resolve to cut some more Stakes, and make me a
Hedge like this in a Semicircle round my Wall; I mean that of my
first Dwelling, which I did; and placing the Trees or Stakes in a
double Row, at about eight Yards' distance from my first Fence, they
grew presently, and were at first a fine Cover to my Habitation, and
afterward served for a Defence also, as I shall observe in its Order.
I found now, That the Seasons of the Year might generally be
divided, not into Summer and Winter, as in Europe; but into the
Rainy Seasons, and the Dry Seasons, which were generally thus,

The Rainy Season sometimes held longer or shorter, as the Winds

I had found by Experience, the ill Consequence of being abroad in
the Rain, I took Care to furnish myself with Provisions beforehand,
Dry, the Sun being then in the South of the Line.
95
that I might not be oblig'd to go out; and I sat within Doors as
much as possible during the wet Months.
In this Time I found much Employment, (and very suitable also
to the Time) for I found great Occasion of many Things which I had
no way to furnish myself with, but by hard Labour and constant
Application; particularly, I tried many Ways to make myself
a Basket, but all the Twigs I could get for the Purpose proved so
brittle, that they would do nothing. It proved of excellent Advan-
tage to me now, That when I was a Boy, I used to take great Delight
in standing at a Basket-maker's, in the Town where my Father lived,
to see them make their Wicker-ware; and being as Boys usually are,

very officious to help, and a great Observer of the Manner how they
worked those Things, and sometimes lending a Hand, I had by this
Means full Knowledge of the Methods of it, that I wanted nothing
but the Materials; when it came into my Mind, That the Twigs of
that Tree from whence I cut my Stakes that grew, might possibly be
as tough as the Sallows, and Willows, and Osiers in England, and I
resolv'd to try.
Accordingly the next Day, I went to my Country-House, as I callo*
it, and cutting some of the smaller Twigs, I found them to my Put
pose as much as I could desire; whereupon I came the next Time
prepar'd with a Hatchet to cut down a Quantity, which I soon found.
for there was great Plenty of them; these I set up to dry within my
Circle or Hedge, and when they were fit for Use, I carried them to
my Cave, and here during the next Season, I employed myself in
making, as well as I could, a great may Baskets, both to carry Earth,
or to carry or lay up anything as I had occasion; and though I did
not finish them very handsomely, yet I made them sufficiently ser-
viceable for my Purpose; and thus afterwards I took Care never to
be without them; and as my Wicker-ware decay'd, I made more,
especially, I made strong deep Baskets to place my Corn in, instead
of Sacks, when I should come to have any Quantity of it
Having master'd this Difficulty, and employ'd a World of Time
about it, I bestirr'd myself to see if possible how to supply two Wants':
I had no Vessels to hold anything (hat was Liquid, except two Run-
lets which were almost full of Rum, and some Glass-Bottles, some of
the common Size, and others which were Case-Bottles-Square, for the
holding of Waters, Spirits, &*c. I had not so much as a Pot to boil
anything, except a great Kettle, which I saved out of the Ship,
and which was too big for such Use as I desir'd, viz. To make Broth,
and stew a Bit of Meat by itself. The Second Thing I would fain
have had was a Tobacco-Pipe; but it was impossible to me to make
one, however, I found a Contrivance for that too at last
I employ'd myself in Planting my Second Rows of Stakes or Piles
and in this Wicker working all the Summer, or dry Season, when
another Business took me up more Time than it could be imagin'd I
could spare.
I mention'd before, That I had a great Mind to see the whole
Island, and that I had travell'd up the Brook, and so on to where I
built my Bower, and where I had an Opening quite to the Sea on the
other Side of the Island; I now resolv'd to travel quite Cross to the
Sea-Shore on that Side; so taking my Gun, a Hatchet, and my Dog,
and a larger Quantity of Powder and Shot than usual, with two Bis-
cuit Cakes, and a great Bunch of Raisins in my Pouch for my Store, I
began my Journey; when I had passed the Vale where my Bower stood
as above, I came within View of the Sea, to the West, and it being a
very clear Day, I fairly descry'd Land, whether an Island or a Con-
tinent, I could not tell; but it lay very high, extending from the West,
to the W.S. W. at a very great Distance; by my Guess it could not be
less than Fifteen or Twenty Leagues off.
I could not tell what Part of the World this might be, otherwise
97
than that I know it must be Part of America, and as I concluded by all
my Observations, must be near the Spanish Dominions, and peihaps
was all Inhabited by Savages, where if I should have landed, I had
been in a worse Condition than I was now; and therefore I acqui-
esced in the Dispositions of Providence, which I began now to own,
and to believe, order'd everything for the best; I say, I quieted my
Mind with this, and left afflicting myself with Fruitless Wishes of be-
ing there.
Besides, after some Pause upon this Affair, I consider'd, that if this
Land was the Spanish Coast, I should certainly, one Time or other,
see some Vessel pass or re-pass one Way or other; but if not, then
it was the Savage Coast between the Spanish Country and Brasils
which are indeed the worst of Savages; for they are Cannibals, or
Men-eaters, and fail not to murder and devour all the human Bodies
that fall into their Hands.
With these Considerations I walked very leisurely forward, I
found that Side of the Island where I now was, much plcasanter
than mine, the open or Savana Fields sweet, adorn'd with Flowers
and Grass, and full of very fine Woods. I saw Abundance of Parrots,
and fain I would have caught one, if possible to have kept it to be
tame, and taught it to speak to me. I did, after some Painstaking,
catch a young Parrot, for I knocked it down with a Stick, and having
recover^ it, I brought it home; but it was some Years before I could
make him speak: However, at last I taught him to call me by my
Name very familiarly: But the Accident that follow'd, though it be a
Trifle, will be very diverting in its Place.
I was exceedingly diverted with this Journey: I found in the low
Grounds Hares, as I thought them to be, and Foxes, but they dif-
fer'd greatly from all the other Kinds I had met with; nor could I
satisfy myself to eat them, though I killed several: But I had no Need
to be venturous; for I had no Want of Food, and of that which was
very good too; especially these three Sorts, viz. Goats, Pigeons, and
Turtle or Tortoise; which, added to my Grapes, Leaden-hall Market
could not have furnish'd a Table better than I, in Proportion to the
Company; and though my Case was deplorable enough, yet I had
great Cause for Thankfulness, and that I was not driven to any
Extremities for Food; but rather Plenty, even to Dainties.
I never travell'd in this Journey above two Miles outright in a Day,
or thereabouts: but I took so many Turns and Returns, to see what
Discoveries I could make, that I came weary enough to the Place
where I resolv'd to sit down for all Night; and then I either repos'd
myself in a Tree, or surrounded myself with a Row of Stakes set upright
in the Ground, either from one Tree to another, or so as no wild
Creature could come at me, without waking me.
As soon as I came to the Sea Shore, I was surpris'd to see that I
had taken up my Lot on the worst Side of the Island; for here
indeed the Shore was cover^ with innumerable Turtles, whereas on
the other Side I had found but three in a Year and half. Here was
also an infinite Number of Fowls, of many Kinds, some which I had
seen, and some which I had not seen of before, and many of them
very good Meat; But such as I knew not the Names of, except
those called Penguins.
I could have shot as many as I pleased, but was very sparing of
my Powder and Shot; and therefore had more Mind to kill a she-
Goat, if I could, which I could better feed on; and though there
were many Goats here more than on my Side the Island, yet it was
with much more Difficulty that I could come near them, the Country
being flat and even, and they saw me much sooner than when I was
on the Hill.
I confess this Side of the Country was much pleasanter than mine,
but yet I had not the least Inclination to remove; for as I was fixed
in my Habitation, it became natural to me, and I seemed all the
while I was here, to be as it were upon a Journey, and from Home:
However, I travell'd along the Shore of the Sea, towards the East,
I suppose about twelve Miles; and then setting up a great Pole upon
the Shore for a Mark, I concluded I would go Home again; and
that the next Journey I took should be on the other Side of the
Island, East from my Dwelling, and so round till I came to my Tost
again: Of which in its Place.
I took another Way to come back than that I went, thinking I
could easily keep all the Island so much in my View, that I could not
miss finding my first Dwelling by viewing the Country; but I found
myself mistaken; for being come about two or three Miles, I found
myself descended into a very large Valley; but so surrounded with
Hills, and those Hills cover'd with Wood, that I could not see which
was my Way by any Direction but that of the Sun, nor even then,
unless I knew very well the Position of the Sun at that Time oi th«
Day.
99
It happen'd to my farther Misfortune, That the WeatnO- proved
hazy for three or four Days, while I was in this Valley; and not be-
ing able to see the Sun, I wander'd about very uncomfortably, and
at last was oblig'd to find out the Sea Side, look for my Post, and
come back the same Way I went; and then by easy Journeys I
turned Homeward, the Weather being exceeding hot, and my Gun,
Ammunition, Hatchet, and other Things very heavy.
In this Journey my Dog surpris'd a Young Kid, and seized upon it,
and I running in to take hold of it, caught it and saved it alive from the
Dog: I had a great Mind to bring it Home if I could; for I had
often been musing, Whether it might not be possible to get a Kid or
two, and so raise a Breed of tame Goats, which might supply me
when my Powder and Shot should be all spent
I made a Collar to this little Creature, and with a String which I
had of some Rope-Yarn, which I always carried about with me, I led

hhn aiong, though with some Difficulty, till I came to my Bower, anu
there I enclos'd him, and left him; for I was very impatient to be at
Home, from whence I had been absent above a Month.
I cannot express what a Satisfaction it was to me, to come into my
old Hutch, and lie down in my Hammock-Bed: This little wandering
Journey, without settled Place of Abode, had been so unpleasant to
me, that my own House, as I called it to mvself, was a perfect
Settlement to me, compar'd to that; and it rendered everything about
me so comfortable, that I resolv'd I would never go a great Way
from it again, while it should be my Lot to stay on the Island.
I repos'd myself here a Week, to rest and regale myself after my
long Journey; during which, most of the Time was taken up in the
weighty Afiair of making a Cage for my Poll, who began now to be a
mere Domestic, and to be mighty well acquainted with me. Then
I began to think of the poor Kid, which I had penned in within my
little Circle, and resolv'd to go and fetch it Home, or give it some
Food; accordingly I went, and found it where I left it; for indeed it
could not get out, but almost starved for want of Food: I went and
cut Boughs of Trees, and Branches of such Shrubs as I could find, and
threw it over, and having fed it, I tied it as I did before, to lead it
away; but it was so tame with being hungry, that I had no need to
have tied it; for it foUWd me like a Dog; and as I continually fed
it, the Creature became so loving, so gentle, and so fond, that it be-
came from that Time one of my Domestics also, and would never
leave me afterwards.
The rainy Season of the Autumnal Equinox was now come, and I
kept the 30th of September in the same solemn Manner as before,
being the Anniversary of my Landing on the Island, having now
been there two Years, and no more Prospect of being deliver'd than
the first Day I came there. I spent the whole Day in humble and
thankful Acknowledgments of the many wonderful Mercies which my
Solitary Condition was attended with, and without which it might
have been infinitely more miserable. I gave humble and hearty
Thanks that God had been pleased to discover to me, even that it
was possible I might be more happy in this Solitary Condition, than
I should have been in a Liberty of Society, and in all the Pleasures
of the World . That he could fully make up to me, the Deficiencies
of my Solitary State, and the want of Human Society, by his Pre-
sence, and the Communications of his Grace to my Soul, supporting,
comforting, and encouraging me to depend upon his Providence here,
and hope for his Eternal Presence hereafter.
It was now that I began sensibly to feel how much more happy
this Life I now led was, with all its miserable Circumstances, than
the vicked, cursed, abominable Life I led all the past Part of my
Days, and now I changed both my Sorrows and my Joys; my very
Desires .tfter'd, my Affections changed their Gusts, and my Delighti
wcte perfectly new, from what they were at my first Coming, or in-
deed for the two Years past
Before, as I walked about, either on my Hunting, or for viewing
the Country; the Anguish of my Soul at my Condition, would break
out upon me on a sudden, and my very Heart would die within me,
to think of the Woods, the Mountains, the Deserts I was in; and
how I was a Prisoner locked up with the Eternal Bars and Bolts of
the Ocean, in an uninhabited Wilderness, without Redemption: In
the midst of the greatest Composures of my Mind, this would break
out upon me like a Storm, and make me wring my Hands, and weep
like a Child: Sometimes it would take me in the middle of my Work,
and I would immediately sit down and sigh, and look upon the
Ground for an Hour or two together; and this was still worse
to me; for if I could burst out into Tears, or vent myself by
Words, it would go off, and the Grief having exhausted itself
would abate.
But now I began to exercise myself with new Thoughts; I daily
read the Word of God, and apply'd all the Comforts of it to my
present State: One Morning being very sad, I open'd the Bible
upon these Words, I will never, never leave thee, nor forsake thee;
immediately it occurr'd, That these Words were to me, Why else
should they be directed in such a Manner, just at the Moment when
I was mourning over my Condition, as one forsaken of God and
Man? Well then, said I, if God does not forsake me, of what ill
Consequence can it be, or what matters it, though the World should
all forsake me, seeing on the other Hand, if I had all the World, and
should lose the Favour and Blessing of God, there would be no Com-
parison in the Loss.
From this Moment I began to conclude in my Mind, That it was
possible for me to be more happy in this forsaken Solitary Condition,
than it was probable I should ever have been in any other Particular
State in the World; and with this Thought I was going to give Thanks
Co God for bringing me to this Place.
I know not what it was, but something shocked my Mind at that
Thought, and I durst not speak the Words: How canst thou be such
a Hypocrite, (said I, even audibly) to pretend to be thankful for a
Condition, which however thou may'st endeavour to be contented
with, thou would'st rather pray heartily to be deliver'd from; so I
stopped there: But though I could not say, J thanked God for being
there; yet I sincerely gave Thanks to God for opening my Eyes, by
whatever afflicting Providences, to see the former Condition of my
Life, and to mourn for my Wickedness, and repent I never open'd
"the Bible, or shut it, but my very Soul within me blessed God for
directing my Friend in England, without any Order of mine, to pack
it up among my Goods; and for assisting me afterwards to save it
out of the Wreck of the Ship.
Thus, and in this Disposition of Mind, I began my third Year;
and though I have not given the Reader the Trouble of so particular
Account of my Works this Year as the first; yet in General it may
be observ'd, That I was very seldom idle; but having regularly
divided my Time, according to the several daily Employments that
were before me, such as, First, My Duty to God, and the Reading
the Scriptures, which I constantly set apart some Time for thrice
every Day. Secondly, The going Abroad with my Gun for Food,
which generally took me up three Hours in every Morning, when it
did not Rain. Thirdly, The ordering, curing, preserving, and cook-
ing what I had killed or caught for my Supply; these took up great
Part of the Day: also it is to be considered that the middle of the
Day when the Sun was in the Zenith, the Violence of the Heat was
too great to stir out; so that about four Hours in the Evening was
all the Time I could be suppos'd to Work in; with this Exception,
That sometimes I changed my Hours of Hunting and Working, and
went to work in the Morning, and Abroad with my Gun in the
Afternoon.
To this short Time allow'd for Labour, I desire may be added the
exceeding Laboriousness of my Work; the many Hours which for
want of Tools, want of Help, and want of Skill, everything I did
took up out of my Time: For Example, I was full two-and-forty
Days making me a Board for a long Shelf, which I wanted in my
Cave; whereas two Sawyers with their Tools, and a Saw-Pit, would
have cut six of them out of the same Tree in half a Day.
My Case was this, It was to be a large Tree, which was to be cut
down, because my Board was to be a broad one. This Tree I was
three Days a cutting down, and two more cutting off the Boughs, and
reducing it to a Log, or Piece of Timber. With inexpressible hack-
ing and hewing I reduc'd both the Sides of it into Chips, till it begun
to be light enough to move; then I turned it, and made one Side ol
it smooth, and flat, as a Board from End to End; then turning that
Side downward, cut the other Side, till I brought the Plank to be
about three Inches thick, and smooth on both Sides. Any one may
judge the Labour of my Hands in such a Piece of Work; but
Labour and Patience carry'd me through that and many other Things:
I only observe this in Particular, to show The Reason why so much of
my Time went away with so little Work, viz. That what might be a
little to be done with Help and Tools, was a vast Labour, and re-
quire a prodigious Time to do alone, and by hand.
But notwithstanding this, with Patience and Labour I went through
many Things; and indeed everything that my Circumstances made
necessary to me to do, as will appear by what follows.
I was now, in the Months of November and December, expecting
my Crop of Barley and Rice. The Ground I had manur'd or dug
up for them was not great; for as I observ'd, my Seed of each was
not above the Quantity of half a Peck; for I had lost one whole
Crop by sowing in the dry Season; but now my Crop promised very
well, when on a sudden I found I was in Danger of losing it all again
by Enemies of several Sorts, which it was scarce possible to keep
from it; as First, The Goats, and wild Creatures which I called
Hares, who tasting the Sweetness of the Blade, lay in it Night and
Day, as soon as it came up, and eat it so close, that it could get
no Time to shoot up into Stalk.
This I saw no Remedy for, but by making an Enclosure about it
with a Hedge, which I did with a great deal of Toil; and the more,
because it requir'd Speed. However, as my Arable Land was but
small, suited to my Crop, I got it totally well fenced, in about three
Weeks' Time; and shooting some of the Creatures in the Daytime,
I set my Dog to guard it in the Night, tying him up to a Stake at the
Gate, where he would stand and bark all Night long; so in a little
Time the Enemies forsook the Place, and the Corn grew very strong,
and well, and began to ripen apace.
But as the Beasts ruined me before, while my Corn was in the
Blade; so the Birds were as likely to ruin me now, when it was in
the Ear; for going along by the Place to see how it throve, I saw my
little Crop surrounded with Fowls of I know not how many sorts,
who stood as it were watching till I should be gone: I immediately
let fly among them (for I always had my Gun with me) I had no
sooner shot but there rose up a little Cloud of Fowls, which I had
not seen at all, from among the Corn itself.
This touched me sensibly, for I foresaw, that in a few Days they
.rould devour all my Hopes, that I should be starved, and never be
able to raise a Crop at all, and what to do I could not tell: How-
ever I resolv'd not to lose my Corn, if possible, though I should
watch it Night and Day. In the first Place, I went among it to
see what Damage was a heady done, and found they had spoiled a
good deal of it, but that as it was yet too Green for them, the
Loss was not so great, but that the Remainder was like to be a
good Crop if it could be saved.
I stayed by it to load my Gun, and then coming away I could easily
see the Thieves sitting upon all the Trees about me, as if they only
waited till I was gone away, and the Event proved it to be so; for as
I walked off as if I was gone, I was no sooner out of their Sight, but
they dropt down one by one into the Corn agam. I was so provok'd
that I could not have Patience to stay till more came on, knowing
that every Grain that they eat now, was, as it might be said, a Peck-
loaf to me in the Consequence; but coming up to the Hedge, I fired
again, and killed three of them. This was what I wished for; so I
took them up, and served them as we serve notorious Thieves in
England, (viz.) Hanged them in Chains for a Terror to others; it is
impossible to imagine almost, that this should have such an Effect, as
it had; for the Fowls would not only not come at the Corn, but in
short they forsook all that Part of the Island, and I could never see
a Bird near the Place as long as my Scare-Crows hung there.
This I was very glad of, you may be sure, and about the latter end
of December, which was our second Harvest of the Year, I reaped my
Crop.
I was sadly put to it for a Scythe or a Sickle to cut it down, and
all I could do was to make one as well as I could out of one of the
Broad Swords or Cutlasses, which I saved among the Arms out of the
Ship. However, as my first Crop was but small I had no great
Difficulty to cut it down; in short, I reaped it my Way, for I cut
nothing off but the Ears, and carry'd it away in a great Basket which
I had made, and so rubbed it out with my Hands; and at the End of
all my Harvesting, I found that out of my half Peck of Seed, I had
near two Bushels of Rice, and above two Bushels and half of Barley,
that is to say, by my Guess, for I had no Measure at that time.
However, this was a great Encouragement to me, and I foresaw
that in time, it would please God to supply me with Bread: And yet
here I was perplex'd again, for I neither knew how to grind or make
Meal of my Corn, or indeed how to clean it or part it; nor if made
into Meal, how to make Bread of it, and if how to make it, yet I
knew not how to bake it; these things being added to my Desire of
having a good Quantity for Store, and to secure a constant Supply, I
resolv'd not to taste any of this Crop but to preserve it all for Seed
against the next Season, and in the mean time to employ all my Study
and Hours of Working to accomplish this great Work of Providing
myself with Corn and Bread.
It might be truly said, that now I worked for my Bread; it is a
little wonderful, and what I believe few People have thought much
upon, (viz.) the strange multitude of little Things necessary in the
Providing, Producing, Curing, Dressing, Making and Finishing this
one Article of Bread.
I that was reduced to a mere State of Nature, found this to my
daily Discouragement, and was made more and more sensible of it
every Hour, even after I had got the first Handful of Seed-Corn,
which, as I have said, came up unexpectedly, and indeed to a
surprise.
First, I had no Plough to turn up the Earth, no Spade or Shovel to
dig it Well, this I conquer'd, by making a wooden Spade, as I ob-
serv'd before; but this did my Work in but a wooden manner, and
though it cost me a great many Days to make it, yet for want of Iron
it not only wore out the sooner, but made my Work the harder, and
made it be perform'd much worse.
However this I bore with, and was content to work it out with
Patience, and bear with the badness of the Performance. When the
Corn was sowed, I had no Harrow, but was forced to go over it my-
self and drag a great heavy Bough of a Tree over it, to Scratch it,
as it may be called, rather than Rake or Harrow it
When it was growing and grown, I have observ'd already, how
many things I wanted, to Fence it, Secure it, Mow or Reap it, Cure
and Carry it Home, Thrash, Part it from the Chaff, and Save it
Then I wanted a Mill to Grind it, Sieves to Dress it, Yeast and Salt to
make it into Bread, and an Oven to bake it, and yet all these things
I did without, as shall be observ'd; and yet the Corn was an in-
estimable Comfort and Advantage to me too. All this, as I said,
made everything laborious and tedious to me, but that there was no
help for; neither was my time so much Loss to me, because as I had
divided it, a certain Part of it was every Day appointed to these
Works; and as I resolv'd to use none of the Cor n for Bread till I had
a greater Quantity by me, I had the next six Months to apply myself
wholly by Labour and Invention to furnish myself with Utensils
proper for the performing all the Operations necessary for the making
the Cor n (when I had it) fit for my use.
But first, I was to prepare more Land, for I had now Seed enough
to sow above an Acre of Ground. Before I did this, I had a Week's
work at least to make me a Spade, which when it was done was but a
sorry one indeed, and very heavy, and requir'd double Labour to work
with it; however I went through that, and sowed my Seed in two
large flat Pieces of Ground, as near my House as I could find them
to my Mind, and fenced them in with a good Hedge, the Stakes of
which were all cut of that Wood which I had set before, and knew it
would grow, so that in one Year's time I knew I should have a Quick
or Living-Hedge, that would want but little Repair. This Work was
not so little as to take me up less than three Months, because great
Part of that time was of the wet Season, when I could not go
abroad.
Within Doors, that is, when it rained, and I could not go out, I
found Employment on the following Occasions; always observing,
that all the while I was at work I diverted myself with talking to my
Parrot, and teaching him to Speak, and 1 quickly learned him to
know his own Name, and at last to speak it out pretty loud POLL,
which was the first Word I ever heard spoken in the Island by any
Mouth but my own. This therefore was not my Work, but an assis-
tant to my Work, for now, as I said, I had a great Employment upon
my Hands, as follows, (viz.) I had long studied by some Means or
other, to make myself some Earthen Vessels, which indeed I wanted
sorely, but knew not where to come at them: However, considering
the Heat of the Climate, I did not doubt but if I could find out any
such Clay, I might botch up some such Pot, as might, being dried in
the Sun, be hard enough, and strong enough to bear handling, and
to hold anything that was dry, and requir'd to be kept so; and as
this was necessary in the preparing Corn, Meal, drv. which was the
Thing I was upon, I resolv'd to make some as large as I could, and
fit only to stand like Jars to hold what should be put into them.
It would make the Reader pity me, or rather laugh at me, to tell
how many awkward ways I took to raise this Paste, what odd
EOB1KSOX C3(*£OE TRACHINfi HIS PARROT TO TALK. — f,
id
misshapen ugly things I made, how many of them fell in, and how
many fell out, the Clay not being stiff enough to bear its own Weight;
how many cracked by the over violent Heat of the Sun, being set out
too hastily; and how many fell in pieces with only removing, as well
before as after they were dried; and in a word, how after having
laboured hard to find the Clay, to dig it, to temper it, to bring it
home and work it; I could not make above two large earthen ugly
things, I cannot call them Jars, in about two Months' Labour.
However, as the Sun baked these Two, very dry and hard, I lifted
them very gently up, and set them down again in two great Wicker
Baskets which I had made on purpose for them, that they might not
break, and as between the Pot and the Basket there was a little room
to spare, I stuffed it full of the Rice and Barley Straw, and these two
Pots being to stand always dry, I thought would hold my dry Corn,
and perhaps the Meal, when the Corn was bruised.
Though I miscarried so much in my Design for large Pots, yet I
made several smaller things with better Success, such as little round
Pots, flat Dishes, Pitchers and Pipkins, and any things my Hand turned
to, and the Heat of the Sun baked them strangely hard.
But all this would not answer my End, which was to get an earthen
Pot to hold what was Liquid, and bear the Fire, which none of these
could do. It happen'd after some time, making a pretty large Fire
for cooking my Meat, when I went to put it out after I had done
with it, I found a broken Piece of one of my Earthenware Vessels
in the Fire, burnt as hard as a Stone, and red as a Tile. I was
agreeably surpris'd to see it, and said to myself, that certainly they
might be made to burn whole if they would burn broken.
This set me to studying how to order my Fire, so as to make it
bur n me some Pots. I had no Notion of a Kiln, such as the Potters
bur n in, or of glazing them with Lead, though I had some Lead to do
it with; but I placed three large Pipkins, and two or three Pots in a
Pile one upon another, and placed my Firewood all round it with a
great Heap of Embers under them, I plied the Fire with fresh Fuel
round the outside, and upon the top, till I saw the Pots in the inside
red hot quite through, and observ'd that they did not crack at all;
when I saw them clear red, I let them stand in that Heat about j or 6
Hours, till I found one of them, though it did not crack, did melt or run,
for the Sand which was mixed with the Clay melted by the violence of
the Heat, and would have run into Glass if I had gone on- so I . -. _ a.

ADVENTURES OF
slacked my Fire gradually till the Pots began to abate of the red
Colour, and watching them all Night, that I might not let the Fire
abate too fast, in the Morning I had three very good, I will not say
handsome, Pipkins; and two other Earthen Pots, as hard burnt as
could be desir'd;
and one of them
perfectly glazed
with the Running
of the Sand.
After this Expe-
riment, I need not
say that I wanted
no sort of Earthen
Ware for my Use;
but I must needs
say, as to the
Shapes of them,
they were very in-
different, as any
one may suppose,
when I had no way
of making them;
but as the Children make Dirt-Pies, or as a Woman would make Pies,
who never learned to raise Paste.
No Joy at a Tiling of so mean a Nature was ever equal to mine,
when I found I had made an Earthen Pot that would bear the Fire;
and I had hardly Patience to stay till they were cold, before I set
one upon the Fire again, with ^me Water in it, to boil me some
Meat, which it did admirably well; and with a Piece of a Kid
I made some very good Broth, though I wanted Oatmeal, and
several other Ingredients, requisite to make it so good as I would
have had it been.
My next Concern was, to get me a Stone Mortar, to stamp or beat
some Corn in; for as to the Mill, there was no thought at arriving to
that Perfection of Art, with one Pair of Hands. To supply this Want
I was at a great Loss; for of all Trades in the World I was as per-
fectly unqualify'd for a Stone-cutter, as for any whatever; neither had
I any Tools to go about it with. I spent many a Day to find out a
great Stone big enough to cut hollow, and make fit for a Mortar, and

109
could find none at all; except what was in the solid Rock, and which
I had no way to dig or cut out; nor indeed were the Rocks in the
Island of Hardness sufficient, but were all of a sandy crumbling Stone,
which neither would bear the Weight of a heavy Pestle, or would
break the Cor n without filling it with Sand; so after a great deal of
Time lost in searching for a Stone, I gave it over, and resolv'd to look
out for a great
Block of hard
Wood, which I
found indeed much
easier; and getting
one as big as I had
Strength to stir, I
rounded it, and
formed it in the
Outside with my
Axe and Hatchet,
and then with the
Help of Fire, and
infinite Labour,
made a hollow
Place in it, as the
Indians in Brasil
make their Canoes.
After this, I made
agreat heavy Pestle
or Beater, of the
Wood called the
Iron-wood, and
this I prepar'd and
laid by against I
had my next Crop
of Corn, when I propos'd to myself, to grind, or rather pound m>
Cor n into Meal to make my Bread.
My next Difficulty was to make a Sieve, or Search, to dress my
Meal, and to part it from the Bran, and the Husk, without which I
did not see it possible I could have any Bread. This was a most
difficult Thing, so much as but to think on; for to be sure I had
nothing like the necessary Thing to make it; I mean fine thin Canvas,

or Stuff, to search the Meal through. And here I was at a full Stop
for many Months; nor did I really know what to do; Linen I had
none left, but what was mere Rags; I had Goat's Hair, but neither
knew I how to weave it, or spin it; and had I known how, here was
no Tools to work it with; all the Remedy that I found for this, was,
That at last I did remember I had among the Seamen's Clothes which
were saved out of the Ship, some Neckcloths of Calico or Muslin;
and with some Pieces of these, I made three small Sieves, but proper
enough for the Work; and thus I made shift for some Years; how I
did afterwards, I shall show in its Place.
The baking Part was the next Thing to be consider'd, and how I
should make Bread when I came to have Corn; for first I had no
Yeast; as to that Part, as there was no supplying the Want, so I did
not concern myself much about it: But for an Oven, I was indeed in
great Pain; at length I found out an Experiment for that also, which
was this; I made some Earthen Vessels very broad, but not deep;
that is to say, about two Foot Diameter, and not above nine Inches
deep; these I burnt in the Fire, as I had done the other, and laid
them by; and when I wanted to bake, I made a great Fire upon my
Hearth, which I had paved with some square Tiles of my own making,
and burning also , but I should not call them square.
When the Firewood was burnt pretty much into Embers, or live
Coals, I drew them forward upon this Hearth, so as to cover it all
over, and there I let them lie, till the Hearth was very hot then
sweeping away all the Embers, I set down my Loaf, or Loaves, and
whelming down the Earthen Pot upon them, drew the Embers all
round the Outside of the Pot, to keep in, and add to the Heat; and
thus, as well as in the best Oven in the World, I baked my Barley
Loaves, and became in little Time a mere Pastrycook into the
Bargain; for I made myself several Cakes of the Rice, and Puddings;
indeed I made no Pies, neither had I anything to put into them,
supposing 1 had, except the Flesh either of Fowls or Goats.
It need not be wondered at, if all these Things took me up most
Part of the third Year of my Abode here; for it is to be observ'd,
That in the Intervals of these Things, I had my new Harvest and
Husbandry to manage; for I reaped my Corn in its Season, and carry'd
it Home as well as I could, and laid it up in the Ear, in my large
Baskets, till I had Time to rub it out; for I had no Floor to thrash it
on. or Instrument to thrash it with.
And now indeed my Stock of Cor n increasing, I really wanted to
build my Barns bigger. I wanted a Place to lay it up in; for the
Increase of the Corn now yielded me so much, that I had of the Barley
about twenty Bushels, and of the Rice as much, or mo re; insomuch,
that now I resolv'd to begin to use it freely; for my Bread had been
; quite gone a great while; Also I resolved to see what Quantity would
be sufficient for me a whole Year, and to sow but once a Year.
Upon the whole, I found that the forty Bushels of Barley and Rice
J was much more than I could consume in a Year; so I resolv'd to sow
just the same Quantity every Year, that I sowed the last, in Hopes
that such a Quantity would fully provide me with Bread, dv<r.
All the while these Things were doing, you may be sure my Thoughts
run many times upon the Prospect of Land which I had seen from the
other Side of the Island, and I was not without secret Wishes that I
were on Shore there, fancying the seeing the main Land, and in an
inhabited Country, I might find some Way or other to convey myself
farther, and perhaps at last find some Means of Escape.
But all this while I made no Allowance for the Dangers of such a
Condition, and how I might fall into the Hands of Savages, and
perhaps such as I might have Reason to think far worse than the
Lions and Tigers of Africa. That if I once came into their Power, I
should run a Hazard more than a thousand to one of being killed,
and perhaps of being eaten; for I had heard that the People of the
Caribbean Coasts were Cannibals, or Man-eaters; and I knew by the
Latitude that I could not be far off from that Shore. That suppose
they were not Cannibals, yet that they might kill me, as many Europeans
who had fallen into their Hands had been served, even when they had
been ten or twenty together; much more I that was but one, and
could make little or no Defence. All these Things, I say, which I
ought to have consider'd well of, and did cast up in my Thoughts
afterwards, yet took up none of my Apprehensions at first; but my
Head run mightily upon the Thought of getting over to the Shore.
Now I wished for my Boy Xury, and the long Boat, with the
Shoulder of Mutton Sail, with which I sailed above a thousand Miles
on the Coast of Africa; but this was in vain. Then I thought I wouW
go and look at our Ship's Boat, which, as I have said, was blown up
upon the Shore, a great Way in the Storm, when we were first cast
away. She lay almost where she did at first, but not quite; and was
turned by the Force of the Waves and the Winds almost Bottom
upward, against a high Ridge of Beachy rough Sand; but no Watei
about her as before.
If I had had Hands to have refitted her, and to have launched her
into the Water, the Boat would have done well enough, and I might
have gone back into the Brasils with her easily enough; but I might
have foreseen, That I could no more turn her, and set her upright
upon her Bottom, than I could remove the Island: However, I went
to the Woods, and cut Levers and Rollers, and brought them to the
Boat, resolv'd to try what I could do, suggesting to myself, That if I
could but turn her down, I might easily repair the Damage she had
receiv'd, and she would be a very good Boat, and I might go to Sea
in her very easily.
I spared no Pains indeed, in this Piece of fruitless Toil, and spent,
I think, three or four Weeks about it; at last finding it impossible to
heave it up with my little Strength, I fell to digging away the Sand, to
undermine it, and so to make it fall down, setting Pieces of Wood to
thrust and guide it right in the Fall.
But when I had done this, I was unable to stir it up again, or to
get under it, much less to move it forward, towards the Water; so I
was forced to give it over; and yet, though I gave over the Hopes of
the Boat, my desire to venture over for the Main increased, rather than
decreased, as the Means for it seemed impossible.
This at length put me upon thinking, Whether it was not possible
to make myself a Canoe, or Periagua, such as the Natives of those
Climates make, even without Tools, or, as I might say, without Hands,
viz. of the Trunk of a great Tree. This I not only thought possible,
but easy, and pleased myself extremely with the Thoughts of making
it, and with my having much more Convenience for it than any of the
Negroes or Indians; but not at all considering the particular Inconve-
niences which I lay under, more than the Indians did, viz. Want of
Hands to move it, when it was made, into the Water, a Difficulty
much harder for me to surmount, than all the Consequences of Want
of Tools could be to them; for what was it to me, That when I had
chosen a vast Tree in the Woods, I might with much Trouble cut it
down, if after I might be able with my Tools to hew and dub the
Outside into the proper Shape of a Boat, and burn or cut out the
Inside to make it hollow, so to make a Boat of it: If after all this, I
must leave it just there where I found it, and was nat able to launch
it into the Water.
"3
One would have thought, I could not have had the least Reflection
upon my Mind of my Circumstance, while I was making this Boat;
but I should have immediately thought how I should get it into the
Sea; but my Thoughts were so intent upon my Voyage over the Sea
in it, that I never once consider'd how I should get it off of the Land;
and it was really in its own Nature more easy for me to guide it over
forty-five Miles of Sea, than about forty-five Fathom of Land, where
it lay, to set it afloat in the Water.
I went to work upon this Boat, the most like a Fool, that ever Man
did, who had any of his Senses awake. I pleased myself with the
Design, without determining whether I was ever able to undertake it;

not but that the Difficulty of launching my Boat came often into my
Head; but I put a stop to my own Inquiries into it, by this foolish
Answer which I gave myself, Let's first make it, ril warrant I'll find
tome Way or other to get it along, when it is done.
This was a most preposterous Method; but the Eagerness of my
Fancy prevail'd, and to work I went I felled a Cedar Tree: 1 ques-
tion much whether Solomon ever had such a One for the Building of
the Temple at Jerusalem. It was five Foot ten Inches Diameter at the
lower Part next the Stump, and four Foot eleven Inches Diameter at
the End of twenty-two Foot, after which it lessen'd for a while, and then
parted into Branches: It was not without infinite Labour that I felled
this Tree: I was twenty Days hacking and hewing at it at the Bottom,
I was fourteen more getting the Branches and Limbs, and the vast
spreading Head of it cut off, which I hacked and hewed through witl
Axe and Hatchet, and inexpressible Labour: After this, it cost me a
Month to shape it, and dub it to a Proportion, and to something lika
the Bottom of a Boat, that it might swim upright as it ought to do.
It cost me near three Months more to clear the Inside, and work it out
so, as to make an exact Boat of it: This I did indeed without Fire,
by mere Mallet and Chisel, and by the dint of hard Labour, till I
had brought it to be a very handsome Periagua, and big enough to
have carried six-and-twenty Men, and consequently big enough to
have carried me and all my Cargo.
When I had gone through this Work, I was extremely delighted with
it The Boat was really much bigger than I ever saw a Canoe, or
Periagua, that was made of one Tree, in my Life. Many a weary
Stroke it had cost, you may be sure; and there remain'd nothing but
to get it into the Water; and had I gotten it into the Water, I make
no question but I should have began the maddest Voyage, and the
most unlikely to be perform'd, that ever was undertaken.
But all my Devices to get it into the Water failed me; though they
cost me infinite Labour too. It lay about one hundred Yards from
the Water, and not more: But the first Inconvenience was, it was up-
hill towards the Creek; well, to take away this Discouragement, I
resolv'd to dig into the Surface of the Earth, and so make a Declivity:
This I begun, and it cost me a prodigious deal of Pains; but who
grudges Pains, that have their Deliverance in View: But when this
was worked through, and this Difficulty manag'd, it was still much at
one; for I could no more stir the Canoe, than I could the other
Boat
Then I measur'd the Distance of Ground, and resolv'd to cut a
Dock, or Canal, to bring the Water up to the Canoe, seeing I could
not bring the Canoe down to the Water: Well, I began this Work,
and when I began to enter into it, and calculate how deep it was to
be dug, how broad, how the Stuff to be thrown out, I found, That by
the Number of Hands I had, being none but my own, it must have
6een ten or twelve Years before I should have gone through with it;
for the Shore lay high, so that at the upper End, it must have been at
least twenty Foot Deep; so at length, though with great Reluctancy,
I gave this Attempt over also.
This grieved me heartily, and now I saw, though too late, the Folly
of beginning a Work before we count the Cost; and before we judge
rightly of our own Strength to go through with it
In the middle of this Work, I finished my fourth Year in this Place,
and kept my Anniversary with the same Devotion, and with as much
Comfort as ever before; for by a constant Study, and serious Appli-
cation of the Word of God, and by the Assistance of his Grace, I
gained a different Knowledge from what I had before. I entertain'd
different Notions of Things. I looked now upon the World as a Thing
remote, which I had nothing to do with, no Expectation from, and
indeed no Desires about: In a Word, I had nothing indeed to do with
it, nor was ever like to have; so I thought it looked as we may per-
haps look upon it hereafter, viz. as a Place I had lived in, but was
come out of it; and well might I say, as Father Abraham to Dives,
Between me and thee is a great Gulf fixed.
In the first Place, I was removed from all the Wickedness of the
World here. I had neither the Lust of the Flesh, the Lust of the Eye,
or the Pride of Life. I had nothing to covet; for I had all that I was
now capable of enjoying: I was Lord of the whole Manor; or if 1
pleased, I might call myself King, or Emperor over the whole Country
which I had Possession of. There were no Rivals: I had no Com-
petitor, none to dispute Sovereignty or Command with me. I might
have raised Ship Loadings of Corn; but I had no use for it; so I let
as little grow as I thought enough for my Occasion. I had Tortoise
or Turtles enough; but now and then one, was as much as I could
put to any use. I had Timber enough to have built a Fleet of Ships.
I had Grapes enough to have made Wine, or to have cured into
Raisins, to have loaded that Fleet when they had been built
But all I could make use of, was, All that was valuable. I had
enough to eat, and to supply my Wants, and, what was all the rest to
me? If I killed more Flesh than I could eat, the Dog must e;it it,
or the Vermin. If I sowed more Corn than I could eat, it must be
spoiled. The Trees that I cut down, were lying to rot on the ('.round:
I could make no more use of them than for Fuel; and that 1 had no
Occasion for, but to dress my Food.
In a Word, The Nature and Experience of Things dictated to me
upon just Reflection, That all the good Things of this World, are no
farther good to us, than they are for our Use; and that whatever we
may heap up indeed to give others, we enjoy just as much as we can
Oje, and no more. The most covetous griping Miser in the Wqrld
would have been cured of the Vice of Covetousness, if he had been in
my Case; for I possess'd infinitely more than I knew what to do with,
I had no room for Desire, except it was of Things which I had not,
and they were but Trifles, though indeed of great Use to me. I had,
as I hinted before, a Parcel of Money, as well Gold as Silver, about
thirty-six Pounds Sterling: Alas! There the nasty sorry useless Stufl
lay; I had no manner of Business for it; and I often thought with
myself, That I would have given a Handful of it for a Gross of To-
bacco Pipes, or for a Hand-Mill to grind my Corn; nay, I would have
given it all for Sixpenny-worth of Turnip and Carrot Seed out of
England, or for a Handful of Pease and Beans, and a Bottle of Ink:
As it was, I had not the least Advantage by it, or Benefit from it; but
there it lay in a Drawer and grew mouldy with the Damp of the Cave,
in the wet Season; and if I had had the Drawer full of Diamonds, it
had been the same Case; and they had been of no manner of Value
to me, because of no Use.
I had now brought my State of Life to be much easier in itself than
it was at first, and much easier to my Mind, as well as to my Body.
I frequently sat down to my Meat with Thankfulness, and admir'd
the Hand of God's Providence, which had thus spread my Table in
the Wilderness. I learned to look more upon the bright Side of my
Condition, and less upon the dark Side; and to consider what I
enjoy'd, rather than what I wanted; and this gave me sometimes
such secret Comforts, that I cannot express them; and which I take
Notice of here, to put those discontented People in Mind of it, who
cannot enjoy comfortably what God has given them; because they
see and covet something that he has not given them: All our Dis.
contents about what we want, appear'd to me, to spring from the
Want of Thankfulness for what we have.
Another Reflection was of great Use to me, and doubtless would
be so to any one that should fall into such Distress as mine was; and
this was, To compare my present Condition with what I at first ex-
pected it should be; nay, with what it would certainly have been, if
the good Providence of God had not wonderfully order'd the Ship
to be cast up nearer to the Shore, where I not only could come at
her, but could bring what I got out of her to the Shore, for my Relief
and Comfort; without which, I had wanted for Tools to work, Weapons
for Defence, or Gunpowder and Shot for getting my Food.
I spent whole Hours, I may say whole Days, in representing to
myself in the most lively Colours, how I must have acted, if I had
got nothing out of the Ship. How I could not have so much as got
any Food, except Fish and Turtles; and that as it was long before I
found any of them, I must have perished first That I should have
lived, if I had not perished, like a mere Savage. That if I had killed
a Goat, or a Fowl, by any Contrivance, I had no way to flay or open
them, or part the Flesh from the Skin, and the Bowels, or to cut it up;
but must gnaw it with my Teeth, and pull it with my Claws like a
Beast
These Reflections made me very sensible of the Goodness of Pro-
vidence to me, and very thankful for my present Condition, with all
its Hardships and Misfortunes: And this Part also I cannot but
recommend to the Reflection of those, who are apt in their Misery to
say, Is any Affliction like mine I Let them consider, How much worse
the Cases of some People are, and their Case might have been, if
Providence had thought fit
I had another Reflection which assisted me also to comfort my
Mind with Hopes; and this was, comparing my present Condition
with what I had deserv'd, and had therefore Reason to expect from
the Hand of Providence. I had lived a dreadful Life, perfectly des-
titute of the Knowledge and Fear of God. I had been well instructed
by Father and Mother; neither had they been wanting to me, in their
early Endeavours, to infuse a religious Awe of God into my Mind, a
Sense of my Duty, and of what the Nature and End of my Being
requir'd of me. But alas! falling early into the Seafaring Life, which
of all the Lives is the most destitute of the Fear of God, though His
Terrors are always before them; I say, falling early into the Seafaring
Life, and into Seafaring Company, all that little Sense of Religion
which I had entertain'd, was laughed out of me by my Messmates,
by a harden'd despising of Dangers; and the Views of Death, which
grew habitual to me; by my long Absence from all Manner of Oppor-
tunities to converse with anything but what was like myself, or to hear
anything that was good, or tended towards it
So void was I of everything that was good, or of the least Sense of
what I was, or was to be, that in the greatest Deliverances I enjoy'd,
such as my Escape from Sallee; my being taken up by the Portuguese
Master of the Ship; my being planted so well in the Brasils; my
receiving the Cargo from England, and the like; I never had once
the Word Thank God, so much as on mv Mind, or in my Mouth; nor
in the greatest Distress, had I so much as a Thought to pray to him,
or so much as to say, Lord have Mercy upon me; no nor to mention
the Name of God, unless it was to swear by, and blaspheme it
I had terrible Reflections upon my Mind for many Months, as I
have already observ'd, on the Account of my wicked and hardened
Life past; and when I looked about me and considered what parti-
cular Providences had attended me since my coming into this Place,
and how God had dealt bountifully with me; had not only punished
me less than my Iniquity had deseiVd, but had so plentifully provided
for me; this gave me great hopes that my Repentance was accepted,
and that God had yet Mercy in store for me.
With these Reflections I worked my Mind up, not only to Resig-
nation to the Will of God in the present Disposition of my Circum-
stances; but even to a sincere Thankfulness for my Condition,
and that I who was yet a living Man, ought not to complain, seeing
I had not the due Punishment cf my Sins; that I enjoy'd so many
Mercies which I had no reason to have expected in that Place; that
I ought never more to repine at my Condition but to rejoice, and to
give daily Thanks for that daily Bread, which nothing but a Crowd of
Wonders could have brought That I ought to consider I had been
fed even by Miracle, even as great as that of feeding Elijah by Ravens;
nay, by a long Series of Miracles, and that I could hardly have named
a Place in the unhabitable Part of the World where I could have
been cast more to my Advantage: A Place, where as I had no Society,
which was my Affliction on one Hand, so I found no ravenous Beast,
no furious Wolves or Tigers to threaten my Life, no venomous Crea-
tures or poisonous, which I might feed on to my Hurt, no Savages to
murder and devour me.
In a Word, as my Life was a Life of Sorrow, one way, so it was a
Life of Mercy, another; and I wanted nothing to make it a Life of
Comfort, but to be able to make my Sense of God's Goodness to me,
and Care over me in this Condition, be my daily Consolation; and
after I did make a just Improvement of these things, I went away
and was no more sad.
I had now been here so long, that many Things which I brought an
Shore for my Help, were either quite gone, or very much wasted and
near spent
My Ink, as I observed, had been gone some time, all but a very
little, which I eked out with Water a little and a little, till it was
SO pale it scarce left any Appearance of black upon the Paper: Ai
long as it lasted, I made use of it to minute down the Days of the
Month on which any remarkable Thing happen'd to me, and first by
casting up Times past: I remember that there was a strange Concur-
»ence of Days in the various Providences which befel me; and which,
if I had been superstitiously inclin'd to observe Days as Fatal or
Fortunate, I might have had Reason to have looked upon with a great
deal of Curiosity.
First I had observed, that the same Day that I broke away from
my Father and my Friends, and run away to Hull, in order to go to
Sea; the same Day afterwards I was taken by the Sallee Man of War,
and made a Slave.
The same Day of the Year that I escaped out of the Wreck of that
Ship in Yarmouth Roads, thart same Day-Year afterwards I made my
escape from Sallee in the Boat
The same Day of the Year I was born on (viz.) the 3oth of Sep-
tember, that same Day, I had my Life so miraculously saved 26 Year
after, when I was cast on Shore in this Island, so that my wicked Life,
and my solitary Life begun both on a Day.
The next Thing to my Ink's being wasted, was that of my Bread, I
mean the Biscuit which I brought out of the Ship, this I had hus-
banded to the last degree, allowing myself but one Cake of Bread a
Day for above a Year, and yet I was quite without Bread for near a
Year before I got any Corn of my own, and great Reason I had to
be thankful that I had any at all, the getting it being, as has been
already observed, next to miraculous.
My Clothes began to decay too mightily: As to Linen, I had had
none a good while, except some chequer'd Shirts which I found in
the Chests of the other Seamen, and which I carefully preserved,
because many times I could bear no other Clothes on but a Shirt;
and it was a very great help to me that I had among all the Men's
Clothes of the Ship almost three dozen of Shirts. There were also
several thick Watch Coats of the Seamen's, which were left indeed,
but they were too hot to wear; and though it is true, that the
Weather was so violent hot, that there was no need of Clothes, yet I
could not go quite naked; no, though I had been inclin'd to it,
which I was not, nor could not abide the thoughts of it, though I was
all alone.
The Reason why I could not go quite naked, was, I could not bear
120
ADVENTURES OP
the heat of the Sun so well when quite naked, as with some Clothe*
on ; nay, the very Heat frequently blistered my Skin ; whereas with a
Shirt on, the Air itself made some Motion and whistling under
that Shirt was twofold cooler than without it; no more could I ever
bring myself to go out in the heat of Sun without a Cap or Hat,
the heat of the Sun beating with such Violence as it does in that
Place, would give me the Head-ache presently, by darting so directly
on my Head, without a Cap or Hat on, so that I could not bear it,
whereas, if I put on my Hat, it would presently go away.
Upon those Views I began to consider about putting the few Rags
I had, which I called Clothes, into some order; I had worn out all
the Waistcoats I had, and my Business was now to try if I could not
make Jackets out of the great Watch-Coats which I had by me, and
such other Materials as I had, so I set to Work a Tailoring, or rather
indeed a Botching, for I
made most piteous Work
of it However, I made
shift to make two or
three new Waistcoats,
which I hoped would
serve me a great while;
as for Breeches or
Drawers, I made but a
sorry shift indeed, till
afterwards.
I have mentioned that
I saved the Skins of all
the Creatures that I
killed, I mean four-footed
ones, and I had hung
them up stretched out
with Sticks in the Sun, by
which means some of
them were so dry and
hard that they were fit
for little, but others it
seems were very useful
The first thing I made of these was a great Cap for my Head,
with the Hair on the Outside to shoot off the Rain: and thi»

I perform'd so well, that after this 1 made me a Suit of Clothes wholly
of these Skins, that is to say, a Waistcoat, and Breeches open at
Knees, and both loose, for they were rather wanting to keep me cool
than to keep me warm. I must not omit to acknowledge that they
were wretchedly made; for if I was a bad Carpenter, I was a worse
Tailor. However, they were such as I made very good shift with;
and when I was abroad, if it happen'd to rain, the Hair of my Waist-
coat and Cap being outermost, I was kept very dry.
After this I spent a great deal of Time and Pains to make me an
Umbrella; I was indeed in great want of one, and had a great Mind
to make one; I had seen them made in the Brasils, where they are
,-ery useful in the great Heats which are there. And I felt the Heats
every jot as great here, and greater too, being nearer the Equinox;
besides, as I was oblig'd to be much abroad, it was a most useful
thing to me, as well for the Rains as the Heats. I took a world of
Pains at it, and was a great while before I could make anything likely
to hold; nay, after I thought I had hit the Way, I spoiled 2 or j
before I made one to my Mind; but at last I made one that answer'd
indifferently well: The main Difficulty I found was to make it to let
down. I could make it to spread, but if it did not let down too, and
draw in, it was not portable for me any Way but just over my Head,
which would not do. However, at last, as I said, I made one to
answer, and covered it with Skins, the Hair upwards, so that it cast
off the Rains like a Pent-house, and kept off the Sun so effectually,
that I could walk out in the hottest of the Weather with greater
Advantage than I could before in the coolest, and when I had no
need of it, could close it and carry it under my Arm.
Thus I lived mighty comfortably, my Mind being entirely composed
by resigning to the Will of God, and throwing myself wholly upon the
Disposal of his Providence. This made my Life better than sociable,
for when I began to regret the want of Conversation, I would ask
rryself whether thus conversing mutually with my own Thoughts, and,
as I hope I may say, with even God himself by Ejaculations, was not
better than the utmost Enjoyment of human Society in the World.
I cannot say that after this, for five Years, any extraordinary thing
happened to me, but I lived on in the same Course, in the same
Posture and Place, just as before; the chief things I was emplo/d
in, besides my yearly Labour of planting my Barley and Rice, and
curing my Raisins, of both which I always kept up just enough to have
sufficient Stock of one Year's Provisions beforehand . I say, beside!
this yearly Labour, and my daily Labour of going out with my Gun,
I had one Labour to make me a Canoe, which at last I finished. So
that by digging a Canal to it of six Foot wide, and four Foot deep, I
brought it into the Creek, almost half a Mile. As for the first, which
was so vastly big, as I made it without considering before-hand, as I
ought to do, how I should be able to launch it; so never being able to
bring it to the Water, or bring the Water to it, I was oblig'd to let it lie
where it was, as a Memorandum to teach me to be wiser next Time;
Indeed, the next Time, though I could not get a Tree proper for i^
and in a Place where I could not get the Water to it, at any less Distance,
than as I have said, near half a Mile; yet as I saw it was practicable
at last, I never gave it over; and though I was near two Years about
it, yet I never grudged my Labour, in Hopes of having a Boat to go
off to Sea at last
However, though my little Periagua was finish'd, yet the Size of it
was not at all answerable to the Design which I had in View, when I
made the first; I mean, Of venturing over to the Terra Firtna, where
it was above forty Miles broad; accordingly, the Smallness of my
Boat assisted to put an Fnd to that Design, and now I thought no
more of it: But as I had a Boat, my next Design was to make a
Tour round the Island; for as I had been on the other Side, in one
Place, crossing as I have already describ'd it, over the Land; so the
Discoveries I made in that little Journey, made me very eager to see
other Parts of the Coast; and now I had a Boat, I thought of nothing
but sailing round the Island.
For this Purpose, that I might do everything with Discretion and
Consideration, I fitted up a little Mast to my Boat, and made a Sail
to it, out of some of the Pieces of the Ship's Sail, which lay in store;
and of which I had a great Stock by me.
Having fitted my Mast and Sail, and tried the Boat, I found she
would sail very well: Then I made little Lockers, or Boxes, at either
End of my Boat, to put Provisions, Necessaries and Ammunition, cVv.
into, to be kept dry, either from Rain, or the Spray of the Sea; and
a little long hollow Place I cut in the Inside of the Boat, where I
could lay my Gun, making a Flap to hang down over it to keep it dry.
I fixed my Umbrella also in a Step at the Stern, like a Mast, to
stand over my Head, and keep the Heat of the Sun off of me like an
Awning; and thus I every now and then took a little Voyage upon the
EAGER TO VIEW CIRCUMFERENCE OF MY LITTLE KINGDOM."
Sea, but iiever went far out, nor far from the little Creek; but at last
being eager to view the Circumference of my little Kingdom, I resolv'd
upon my Tour, and accordingly I victualed my Ship for the Voyage,
putting in two Dozen of my Loaves (Cakes I should rather call them)
of Barley Bread, an Earthen Pot full of parched Rice, a Food I eat a
great deal of, a little Bottle of Rum, half a Goat, and Powder and
Shot for killing more, and two large Watch-coats, of those which, as I
mention'd before, I had saved out of the Seamen's Chests; these I
took, one to lie upon, and the other to cover me in the Night
It was the sixth of November, in the sixth Year of my Reign, or my
Captivity, which you please, That I set out on this Voyage, and I
found it much longer than I expected; for though the Island itself
was not very large, yet when I came to the East Side of it, I found a
great Ledge of Rocks lie out above two Leagues into the Sea, some
above Water, some under it; and beyond that, a Shoal of Sand, lying
dry half a League more; so that I was oblig'd to go a great Way out
to Sea to double the Point
When first I discover'd them, I was going to give over my Enter-
prise, and come back again, not knowing how far it might oblige me
to go out to Sea; and above all, doubting how I should get back
again; so I came to an Anchor; for I had made me a kind of an
Anchor with a Piece of a broken Graplin, which I got out of the Ship.
Having secur'd my Boat, I took my Gun, and went on Shore,
climbing up upon a Hill, which seemed to overlook that Point, where
I saw the full Extent of it, and resolv'd to venture.
In my viewing the Sea from that Hill where I stood, I perceiv'd
a strong, and indeed, a most furious Current, which ran to the East,
and even came close to the Point; and I took the more Notice of it,
because I saw there might be some Danger; that when I came into
it, I might be carried out to Sea by the Strength of it, and not be able
to make the Island again; and indeed, had I not gotten first up upon
this Hill, I believe it would have been so; for there was the same
Current on the other Side the Island, only, that it set off at a farther
Distance; and I saw there was a strong Eddy under the Shore; so I
had nothing to do but to get in out of the first Current, and I should
presently be in an Eddy.
I lay here, however, two Days; because the Wind blowing pretty
fresh at E.S.E. and that being just contrary to the said Current, made
a great Breach of the Sea upon the Point; so '.hat it was not safe for
me to keep too close to the Shore for the Breach, nor to go too fei
off because of the Stream. „w«*»
The third Day in the Morning, the Wind having abated over Night,
the Sea was calm, and I ventur'd; but I am a warning F»W»
aU rash and ignorant Pilots; for no sooner was I come to the Point,
when even I was not my Boat's Length from the Shore but I found
my elf in a great Depth of Water, and a Current like the Sluice of a
MU1: It carried my Boat along with it with such Violence, That aU
I could do, could not keep her so much as on the Edge of it; but I
found it hurried me farther and farther out from the Eddy, which wa.
on my left Hand. There was no Wind staring to help me and all
I could do with my Paddlers signify'd nothing, and now_I began to
give myself over for lost; for as the Current was on both Sides tlie

Island, I knew in a few Leagues' Distance Uiey must join again, and
then I was irrecoverably gone; nor did I see any Possibility of avoid-
ing it; so that I had no Prospect before me but of Penshmg; not by
the Sea, for that was calm enough, but of starving for Hunger. 1 had
indeed found a Tortoise on the Shore, as big almost as I could lift,
and had tossed it into the Boat; and I had a great Jar of fresh Water,
that is to say, one of my Earthen Pots; but what was all this to being
driven into the vast Ocean, where to be sure, there was no Shore, no
main I^nd, or Island, for a thousand Leagues at least
And now I saw how easy it was for the Providence of God to make
the most miserable Condition Mankind could be in, worse. Now I
looked back upon my desolate solitary Island, as the most pleasant
Place in the World, and all the Happiness my Heart could wish for,
was to be but there again. I stretched out my Hands to it with eager
Wishes. 0 happy Desert, said I, I shall never see thee more. 0
miserable Creature, said I, whither am I going: Then I reproach'd
myself with my unthankful Temper, and how I had repin'd at my
solitary Condition; and now what would I give to be on Shore there
again. Thus we never see the true State of our Condition, till it is
illustrated to us by its Contraries; nor know how to value what we
enjoy, but by the want of it It is scarce possible to imagine the
Consternation I was now in, being driven from my beloved Island
(for so it appear'd to me now to be) into the wide Ocean, almost two
Leagues, and in the utmost Despair of ever recovering it again.
However, I worked hard, till indeed my Strength was almost exhausted,
and kept my Boat as much to the Northward, that is, towards the
Side of the Current which the Eddy lay on, as possibly I could; when
about Noon, as the Sun passed the Meridian, I thought I felt a little
Breeze of Wind in my Face, springing up from the S.S.E. This
cheered my Heart a little, and especially when in about half an Hour
more, it blew a pretty small gentle Gale. By this Time I was gotten
at a frightful Distance from the Island, and had the least Cloud or
hazy Weather interven'd, I had been undone another Way too; for I
had no Compass on Board, and should never have known how to have
steered towards the Island, if I had but once lost Sight of it; but the
Weather continuing clear, I applied myself to get up my Mast again,
spread my Sail, standing away to the North, as much as possible, to
get out of the Current
Just as I had set my Mast and Sail, and the Boat began to stretch
away, I saw even by the Clearness of the Water, some Alteration of
the Current was near; for where the Current was so strong, the Water
was foul; but perceiving the Water clear, I found the Current abate,
1 and presently I found to the East, at about half a Mile, a Breach of
1 the Sea upon some Rocks; these Rocks I found caused the Current
to part again, and as the main Stress of it ran away more Southerly,
leaving the Rocks to the North-East; so the other return'd by the
Repulse of the Rocks, and made a strong Eddy, which ran back again
to the North- West, with a very sharp Stream.
They who know what it is to have a Reprieve brought to them upon
the Ladder, or to be rescued from Thieves just a going to murder them,
or who have been in such like Extremities, may guess what my present
Surprise of Joy was, and how gladly I put my Boat into the Stream
of this Eddy, and the Wind also freshening, how gladly I spread my
Sail to it, running cheerfully before the Wind, and with a strong Tide
or Eddy under Foot
This Eddy carried me about a League in my Way back again
directly towards the Island, but about two Leagues more to the
Northward than the Current which carried me away at first; so that
when I came near the Island, I found myself open to the Northern
Shore of it, that is to say, the other End of the Island opposite to that
which I went out from.
When I had made something more than a League of Way by the
help of this Current or Eddy, I found it was spent and served me no
farther. However, I found that being between the two great
Currents, (viz.) that on the South Side, which had hurried me away,
and that on the North, which lay about a League on the other Side:
I say between these two, in the wake of the Island, I found the
Water at least still and running no Way, and having still a Breeze of
Wind fair for me, I kept on steering directly for the Island, though
not making such fresh Way as I did before.
About four o'clock in the Evening, being then within about a
League of the Island, I found the Point of the Rocks which occa-
sioned this Disaster, stretching out as is described before to the
Southward, and casting off the Current more Southwardly, had of
Course made another Eddy to the North, and this I found very strong,
but not directly setting the Way my Course lay which was due West,
but almost full North. However, having a fresh Gale, I stretched
across this Eddy slanting North-west, and in about an Hour came
within about a Mile of the Shore, where it being smooth Water, I
soon got to Land.
When I was on Shore I fell on my Knees and gave God Thanks
for my Deliverance, resolving to lay aside all Thoughts of my Deli-
verance by my Boat, and refreshing myself with such Things as I
had, I brought my Boat close to the Shore in a little Cove that I had
spied under some Trees, and laid me down to sleep, being quite
spent with the Labour and Fatigue of the Voyage.
I was now at a great Loss which Way to get Home with my Boat:
I had run so much Hazard, and knew too much the Case to think of
attempting it by the Way I went out, and what might be at the other
Side (I mean the West Side) I knew not, nor had I any Mind to run
Any more Ventures; so I oniy resoived in the Morninc to make mj
Way Westward along the Shore and to see if there was no Creek
where I might lay up my Frigate in Safety, so as to have her again if
I wanted her; in about three Mile or thereabout coasting the Shore,
I came to a very good Inlet or Bay about a Mile over, which nar-
rowed till it came to a very little Rivulet or Brook, where I found a
very convenient Harbour for my Boat, and where she lay as if she
had been in a little Dock made on Purpose for her. Here I put in.
and having stowed my Boat very safe, I went on Shore to look about
me and see where I was.
I soon found I had but a little passed by the Place where I had
been before, when I travell'd on Foot to that Shore; so taking nothing
out of my Boat, but my Gun and my Umbrella, for it was exceedingly
hot, I began my March: The Way was comfortable enough aftei
such a Voyage as I had been upon, and I reached my old Bower in
the Evening, where I found everything standing as I left it; for I
always kept it in good Order, being, as I said before, my Country House.
I got over the Fence, and laid me down in the Shade to rest my
Limbs ; for I was very weary, and fell asleep: But judge you, if you
can, that read my Story, what a Surprise I must be in, when I was
waked out of my Sleep by a Voice calling me by my Name several
times, Robin, Robin, Robin Crusoe, poor Robin Crusoe, where are you
Robin Crusoe? Where are you? Where have you been?
I was so dead asleep at first, being fatigu'd with Rowing, or Pad-
dling, as it is called, the first Part of the Day, and with walking
the latter Part, that I did not wake thoroughly, but dozing between
sleeping and waking, thought I dreamed that somebody spoke to
me: But as the Voice continu'd to repeat, Robin Crusoe, Robin
Crusoe, at last I began to wake more perfectly, and was at first
dreadfully frighted, and started up in the utmost Consternation: But
no sooner were my Eyes open, but I saw my Pott sitting on the Top
of the Hedge; and immediately knew that it was he that spoke to
me; for just in such bemoaning Language I had used to talk to
him, and teach him; and he had learned it so perfectly, that he
would sit upon my Finger, and lay his Bill close to my Face, and cry,
Poor Robin Crusoe, Where are you? Where have you been? How
come you here? and such things as I had taught him.
However, even though I knew it was the Parrot, and that indeed
it could be nobody else, it was a good while before I could
compose myself: First, I was amazed how the Creature got thither,
and then, how he should just keep about the Place, and nowhere
else: But as I was well satisfied it could be nobody but honest
Poll, I got it over; and holding out my Hand, and calling him by his
Name Poll, the sociable Creature came to me, and sat upon my
Thumb, as he used to do, and continu'd talking to me, Poor Robin
Crusoe, and how did I come here? and where had I been ? just as if he
had been overjoy'd to see me again; and so I carry'd him Home
along with me.
I had now had enough of rambling to Sea for some time, and had
enough to do for many Days to sit still, and reflect upon the Danger
I had been in: I would have been very glad to have had my Boat
again on my Side of the Island; but I knew not how it was practi-
cable to get it about; as to the East Side of the Island, which I had
gone round, I knew well enough there was no venturing that Way;
my very heart would shrink, and my very Blood run chill but to
think of it: And as to the other Side of the Island, I did not know
how it might be there; but supposing the Current ran with the same
Force against the Shore at the East as it passed by it on the other,
I might run the same Risk of being driven down the Stream, and
carried by the Island, as I had been before, of being carried away
from it; so with these Thoughts I contented myself to be without
any Boat, though it had been the Product of so many Months' Labour
to make it, and of so many more to get it unto the Sea.
In this Government of my Temper, I remain'd near a Year, lived
a very sedate retir'd Life, as you may well suppose; and my Thoughts
being very much composed as to my Condition, and fully comforted
in resigning myself to the Dispositions of Providence, I thought I
lived really very happily in all things, except that of Society.
I improv'd myself in this time in all the mechanic Exercises which
my Necessities put me upon applying myself to, and I believe could,
upon Occasion, make a very good Carpenter, especially considering
how few Tools I had.
Besides this, I arriv'd at an unexpected Perfection in my Earthen-
ware, and contriv'd well enough to make them with a Wheel, which
I found infinitely easier and better; because I made things round
and shapeable, which before were filthy things indeed to look on.
But I think I was never more vain of my own Performance, or more
joyful for anything I found out, than for my being able to make a
Tobacco-Pipe. And though it was a verj" ugly clumsy thing, when
119
It was done, and only burnt red like other Earthenware, yet as it
was hard and firm, and would draw the Smoke, I was exceedingly
comforted with it, for I had been always used to smoke, and there
were Pipes in the Ship, but 1 forgot them at first, not knowing that
there was Tobacco in
the Island; and after-
wards, when I searched
the Ship again, I could
not come at any Pipes
at all
.
In my Wicker-ware
also I improved much,
and made abundance
of necessary Baskets,
as well as my Invention
showed me, though not
very handsome, yet
they were such as were
very handy and con-
venient for my laying
things up in, or fetch-
ing things home in.
For Example, if I killed
a Goat abroad, I could
hang it up in a Tree,
flay it, and dress it, and
cut it in Pieces, and bring it home in a Basket, and the like by a
Turtle, I could cut it up, take out the Eggs, and a Piece or two of
the Flesh, which was enough for me, and bring them home in a
Basket, and leave the rest behind me. Also large deep Baskets
were my Receivers for my Corn, which I always rubbed out as soon
as it was dry, and cured, and kept it in great Baskets.
I began now to perceive my Powder abated considerably, and this
was a Want which it was impossible for me to supply, and I began
seriously to consider what I must do when I should have no more
Powder; that is to say, how I should do to kill any Goat I had, as
is observ'd in the third Year of my being here, kept a young Kid,
and bred her up tame, and I was in hope of getting a He-Goat, but I
could not by any Means bring it to pass, till my Kid grew an old Goat:

and I could never find it in my Heart to kill her, till she died at last
of mere Age.
But being now in the eleventh Year of my Residence, and, as I
have said, my Ammunition growing low, I set myself to study some
Art to trap and snare the Goats, to see whether I could not catch
some of them alive, and particularly I wanted a She-Goat great with
young.
To this Purpose I made Snares to hamper them, and I do believe
they were more than once taken in them, but my Tackle was not
good, for I had no Wire, and I always found them broken, and my
Bait devoured.
At length I resolv'd to try a Pitfall, so I dug several large Pits in
the Earth, in Places where I had observ'd the Goats used to feed,
and over these Pits I placed Hurdles of my own making too, with a
great Weight upon them; and several times I put Ears of Barley,
and dry Rice, without setting the Trap, and I could easily perceive
that the Goats had gone in and eaten up the Corn, for I could see the
Vlark of their Feet At length I set three Traps in one Night, and
going the next Morning I found them all standing, and yet the Bait
eaten and gone: This was very discouraging. However, I alter'd
my Trap, and, not to trouble you with Particulars, going one Morning
to see my Trap, I found in one of them a large old He-Goat, and in
one of the other, three Kids, a Male and two Females.
As to the old one, I knew not what to do with him, he was so
fierce I durst not go into the Pit to him; that is to say, to go
about to bring him away alive, which was what I wanted. I could
have killed him, but that was not my Business, nor would it answer my
End. So I e'en let him out, and he ran away as if he had been
frighted out of his Wits: But I had forgot then what I learned after-
wards, that Hunger will tame a Lion. If I had let him stay there
three or four Days without Food, and then have carried him some
Water to drink, and then a little Corn, he would have been as tame
as one of the Kids, for they are mighty sagacious tractable Creatures
where they are well used.
However, for the present I let him go, knowing no better at that
time; then I went to the three Kids, and taking them one by one, I tied
them with Strings together, and with some Difficulty brought them
all home.
It was a good while before thev would feed, but throwing then
«J1
some sweet Corn, it tempted them and they began to be tame; and
now I found that if I expected to supply myself with Goat-Flesh whes
I had no Powder or Shot left, breeding some up tame was my only
way, when perhaps I might have them about my House like a Flock
of Sheep.

But then it presently occurr'd to me, that I must keep the tame
from the wild, or else they would always run wild when they grew
up, and the only Way for this was to have some enclosed Piece
of Ground, well fenced either with Hedge or Pale, to keep them
in so effectually, that those within might not break out, or those with-
out break in.
This was a great Undertaking for one Pair of Hands, yet as I saw
there was an absolute Necessity of doing it, my first Piece of Work
was to find out a proper Piece of Ground, viz. where there was likely
to be Herbage for them to eat, Water for them to drink, and Cover
to keep them from the Sun.
Those who understand such Enclosures will think I had very
little Contrivance, when I pitched upon a Place very proper for all
these, being a plain open Piece of Meadow-Land or Savana, (as our
People call it in the Western Colonies,) which had two or three
little Rills of fresh Water in it, and at one end was very woody. I
say they will smile at my Forecast, when I shall tell them I began
my enclosing of this Piece of Ground in such a manner, that my
Hedge or Pale must have been at least two Mile about Nor was the
Madness of it so great as to the Compass, for if it was ten Mile about
I was like to have time enough to do it in. But I did not consider
that my Goats would be as wild in so much Compass, as if they had
had the whole Island, and I should have so much Room to chaw
them in, that I should never catch them.
My Hedge was begun and carried on, I believe about fifty Yards,
when this Thought occurr'd to me, so I presently stopped short,
and for the first beginning I resolv'd to enclose a Piece of about
150 Yards in length, and 100 Yards in breadth, which as it would
maintain as many as I should have in any reasonable time, so as my
Flock increased, I could add more Ground to my Enclosure.
This was acting with some Prudence, and I went to work with
Courage. I was about three Months hedging in the first Piece, and
till I had done it I tether'd the three Kids in the best Part of it, and
used them to feed as near me as possible to make them familiar; and
very often I would go and carry them some Ears of Barley, or a handful
of Rice, and feed them out of my Hand; so that after my Enclosure
was finished, and I let them loose, they would follow me up and
down, bleating after me for a handful of Corn.
This answer'd my End, and in about a Year and half I had a
Flock of about twelve Goats, Kids and all; and in two Years more
I had three-and-forty, besides several that I took and killed for my
Food. And after that I enclosed five several Pieces of Ground to
feed them in, with little Pens to drive them into, to take them as I
wanted, and Gates out of one Piece of Ground into another.
But this was not all, for now I not only had Goat's-Flesh to feed on
when I pleased, but Milk too, a thing which indeed in my beginning
I did not so much as think of, and which, when it came into my
Thoughts, was really an agreeable Surprise. For now I set up my
Dairy, and had sometimes a Gallon or two of Milk in a Day. And as
Nature, who gives Supplies of Food to every Creature, dictates even
naturally how to make use of it; so I that had never milked a Cow,
much less a Goat, or seen Butter or Cheese made, very readily and
handily, though after a great many Essays and Miscarriages, made me
both Butter and Cheese at last, and never wanted it afterwards.
How mercifully can our great Creator treat his Creatures, even in
those Conditions in which they seemed to be overwhelm'd in Des-
truction. How can he sweeten the bitterest Providences, and give
us cause to praise Him for Dungeons and Prisons. What a Table was
here spread for me in a Wilderness, where I saw nothing at first but
to perish for Hunger.
It would have made a Stoic smile to have seen me and my little
Family sit down to Dinner] there was my Majesty the Prince and
Lord of the whole Island; I had the Lives of all my Subjects at my
«.'J
absolute Command . I could hang, draw, give Liberty, and take it
away, and no Rebels among all my Subjects.
Then to see how like a King I dined too all alone, attended by
my Servants, Poll, as if he had been my Favourite, was the only Per-
son permitted to talk to me. My Dog who was now grown very old
and crazy, and had found no Species to multiply his Kind upon, sat
always at my Right - ._
Hand, and two
Cats, one on one
Side the Table,
and one on the
other, expecting now
and then a Bit
from my Hand, as
a Mark of special
Favour.
But these were
not the two Cats
which I brought on
Shore at first, for
they were both of
them dead, and had
been interr'd near
my Habitation by
my own Hand; but one of them having multiplied by I know
not what Kind of Creature, these were two which I had preseiVd
tame, whereas the rest ran wild in the Woods, and became in-
deed troublesome to me at last; for they would often come into my
House, and plunder me too, till at last I was obliged to shoot them, and
did kill a great many ; at length they left me with this Attendance, and
in this plentiful Manner I lived; neither could I be said to want any-
thing but Society, and of that in some time after this, I was like to
have too much.
I was something impatient, as I have observ'd, to have the Use of
my Boat; though very loth to run any more Hazards; and therefore
sometimes I sat contriving Ways to get her about the Island, and at
other Times I sat myself down contented enough without her. But I
had a strange Uneasiness in my Mind to go down to the Point of the
Island, where, as I have said, in my last Ramble, I went up the HOI

to see how the Shore lay, and how the Current set, that I might see
what I had to do: This Inclination increas'd upon me every Day,
and at length I resolv'd to travel thither by Land, following the Edge
of the Shore, I did so: But had anyone in England been to meet
such a Man as I was, it must either have frighted them, or raised a
great deal of Laughter; and as I frequently stood still to look at my-'
self, I could not but smile at the Notion of my travelling through
Yorkshire with such an Equipage, and in such a Dress: Be pleased
to take a Sketch of my Figure as follows,
I had a great high shapeless Cap, made of a Goat's Skin, with a
Flap hanging down behind, as well to keep the Sun from me, as to
shoot the Rain off from running into my Neck; nothing being so
hurtful in these Climates, as the Rain upon the Flesh under the
Clothes.
I had a short Jacket of Goat-Skin, the Skirts coming down to
about the middle of my Thighs; and a Pair of open-kneed Breeches
of the same, the Breeches were made of the Skin of an old He-Goat,
whose Hair hung down such a Length on either Side, that like Pan-
taloons' it reached to the middle of my Legs; Stockings and Shoes
I had none, but had made me a Pair of somethings, I scarce know
what to call them, like Buskins to flap over my Legs, and lace on
either Side like Spatterdashes; but of a most barbarous Shape, as
indeed were all the rest of my Clothes.
I had on a broad Belt of Goat's-Skin dried, which I drew to-
gether with two Thongs of the same, instead of Buckles, and in a
kind of a Frog on either Side of this, instead of a Sword and a Dagger,
hung a little Saw and a Hatchet, one on one Side, one on the other.
I had another Belt not so broad, and fasten'd in the same Man-
ner, which hung over my Shoulder; and at the End of it, under my
left Arm, hung two Pouches, both made of Goat's-Skin too; in one
of which hung my Powder, in the other my Shot: At my Back I
carried my Basket, on my Shoulder my Gun, and over my Head a
great clumsy ugly Goat-Skin Umbrella, but which, after all, was the
most necessary Thing I had about me, next to my Gun: As for my
Face, the Colour of it was really not so Mulatto, like as one might
expect from a Man not at all careful of it, and living within nineteen
Degrees of the Equinox. My Beard I had once suffer'd to grow
till it was about a Quarter of a Yard long; but as I had both Scissars
and Razors sufficient, I had cut it pretty short, except what grew on
my upper Lip, which I had trimmed into a large Pair of Mahometan
Whiskers, such as I had seen worn by some Turks, who I saw at Sal-
Itt; for the Moors did not wear such, though the Turks did; of these
Moustachos or Whiskers, I will not say they were long enough to
hang my Hat upon them; but they were of a Length and Shape
monstrous enough, and such as in England would have passed for
frightful.
But all this is by the by; for as to my Figure, I had so few to ob-
serve me, that it was of no manner of Consequence; so I say no
more to that Part In this kind of Figure I went my new Journey,
and was out five or six Days. I travell'd first along the Sea-Shore,
directly to the Place where I first brought my Boat to an Anchor, to get
up upon the Rocks; and having no Boat now to take care of, I went
over the Land a nearer Way, to the same Height that I was upon before,
when looking forward to the Point of the Rocks which lay out, and
which I was oblig'd to double with my Boat, as is said above: I was
surpris'd to see the Sea all smooth and quiet, no Rippling, no Motion,
no Current, any more than in other Places.
I was at a strange Loss to understand this, and resolv'd to spend
some Time in the observing it, to see if nothing from the Sets of the
Tide had occasion'd it; but I was presently convinc'd how it was, viz.
That the Tide of Ebb setting from the West, and joining with the
Current of Waters from some great River on the Shore, must be the
Occasion of this Current; and that according as the Wind blew more
forcibly from the West, or from the North, this Current came nearer,
or went farther from the Shore; for waiting thereabouts till Evening,
I went up to the Rock again, and then the Tide of Ebb being made,
I plainly saw the Current again as before, only, that it run farther off,
being near half a League from the Shore; whereas in my Case, it
*et close upon the Shore, and hurried me and my Canoe along with
it, which at another Time it would not have done.
This Observation convinc'd me, That I had nothing to do but to
observe the Ebbing and the Flowing of the Tide, and I might very
easily bring my Boat about the Island again: But when I began to
think of putting it in Practice, I had such a Terror upon my Spirits
at the Remembrance of the Danger I had been in, that I could
not think of it again with any Patience; but on the contrary, I took
up another Resolution which was more safe, though more laborious;
and this was, That I would build, or rather make me another
Periagua or Canoe; and so have one for one Side of the Island, and
one for the other.
You are to understand, that now I had, as I may call it, two
Plantations in the Island; one my little Fortification or Tent, with
the Wall about it under the Rock, with the Cave behind me, which
by this Time I had enlarg'd into several Apartments, or Caves, one
within another. One of these, which was the dryest, and largest,
and had a Door out beyond my Wall or Fortification; that is to say,
beyond where my Wall joined to the Rock, was all filled up with the
large Earthen Pots, of which I have given an Account, and with four-
teen or fifteen great Baskets, which would hold five or six Bushels
each, where I laid up my Stores of Provision, especially my Corn,
some in the Ear cut off short from the Straw, and the other rubbed
out with my Hand.
As for my Wall made, as before, with long Stakes or Piles, those
Piles grew all like Trees, and were by this Time grown so big, and
spread so very much, that there was not the least Appearance to any
one's View of any Habitation behind them.
Near this Dwelling of mine, but a little farther within the Land,
and upon lower Ground, lay my two Pieces of Corn-Ground, which I
kept duly cultivated and sowed, and which duly yielded me their
Harvest in its Season; and whenever I had occasion for more Corn,
I had more Land adjoining as fit as that
Besides this, I had my Country Seat, and I had now a tolerable
Plantation there also; for first, I had my little Bower, as I called it,
which I kept in Repair; that is to say, I kept the Hedge which
circled it in constantly fitted up to its usual Height, the Ladder
standing always in the Inside; I kept the Trees which at first were
no more than my Stakes, but were now grown very firm and tall; I
kept them always so cut, that they might spread and grow thick and
wild, and make the more agreeable Shade, which they did effectually
to my Mind. In the Middle of this I had my Tent always standing,
being a piece of a Sail spread over Poles set up for that Purpose, and
which never wanted any Repair or Renewing; and under this I had
made me a Squab or Couch, with the Skins of the Creatures I had
killed, and with other soft Things, and a Blanket laid on them, such
as belong'd to our Sea-Bedding, which I had saved, and a great
Watch-Coat to Cover me; and here, whenever I had Occasion to be
absent from my chief Seat, I took up my Country Habitation.
Adjoining to this I had my Enclosures for my Cattle, that is to say,
my Goats: And as I had taken an inconceivable deal of Fains to fence
and inclose this Ground, so I was so uneasy to see it kept entire,
lest the Goats should break through, that I never left off till with in-
finite Labour I had stuck the Outside of the Hedge so full of small
Stakes, and so near to one another, that it was rather a Pale than a
Hedge, and there was scarce Room to put a Hand through between
them, which afterwards when those Stakes grew, as they all did in the
next rainy Season, made the Enclosure strong like a Wall, indeed
•tronger than any Wall.
This will testify for me that I was not idle, and that I spared no
Pains to bring to pass whatever appear'd necessary for my comfort-
able Support; for I consider^ the keeping up a Breed of tame
Creatures thus at my Hand, would be a living Magazine of
Flesh, Milk, Butter and Cheese, for me as long as I lived in the
Place, if it were to be forty Years; and that keeping them in my
Reach, depended entirely upon my perfecting my Enclosures to such
a Degree, that I might be sure of keeping them together; which by
this Method indeed I so effectually secur'd, that when these little
Stakes began to grow, I had planted them so very thick, I was foivM
to pull some of them up again.
In this Place also I had my Grapes growing, which I principally
depended on for my Winter Store of Raisins; and which I never
failed to preserve very carefully, as the best and most agreeable Dainty
of my whole Diet; and indeed they were not agreeable only, but
physical, wholesome, nourishing, and refreshing to the last Degree.
As this was also about half Way between my other Habitation, and
the Place where I had laid up my Boat, I generally stayed, and lay here
in my Way thither; for I used frequently to visit my Boat, and I kept all
Things about or belonging to her in very good Order; sometimes I went
out in her to divert myself, but no more hazardous Voyages would I go,
nor scarce ever above a Stone's Cast or two from the Shore, I was so
apprehensive of being hurried out of my Knowledge again by the
Currents, or Winds, or any other Accident But now I come to a
new Scene of my Life.
It happen'd one Day about Noon going towards my Boat, I was
exceedingly surpris'd with the Print of a Man's naked Foot on the
Shore, which was very plain to be seen in the Sand : I stood like one
Thunder-struck, or as if I had seen *n Apparition; I listen'd, I looked

ADVENTURES OF
round me, T could hear nothing, nor see anything; I went up to *
rising Ground to look farther, I went up the Shore and down the
Shore, but it was all one, I could see no other Impression but that
one, I went to it again to see if there were any more, and to observe
if it might not be my Fancy; but there was no Room for that, for
there was exactly the very Print of a Foot, Toes, Heel, and every Part
of a Foot; how it came thither, I knew not, nor could in the least
imagine. But after innumerable fluttering Thoughts, like a Man per-
fectly confus'd and out of myself, I came Home to my Fortification,
not feeling, as we say, the Ground I went on, but terrify'd to the last
Degree, looking behind me at every two or three Steps, mistaking
every Bush and Tree, and fancying every Stump at a Distance to be a
Man; nor is it possible to describe how many various Shapes affrighted
Imagination representei Things to me in, how many wild Idcn? werr

<3»
round every Moment in my Fancy, and what strange unaccountable
Whimsies came into my Thoughts by uie Way.
When I came to my Castle, for so I think I called it ever after this,
I fled into it like one pursued; whether I went over by the Ladder as
first contriv'd, or went in at the Hole in the Rock, which I called a
Door, I cannot remember; no, nor could I remember the next morn-
ing; for never frighted Hare fled to Cover, or Fox to Earth, with
more Terror of Mind than I to this Retreat
I slept none that Night; the farther I was from the Occasion of
my Fright, the greater my Apprehensions were; which is something
contrary to the Nature of such Things, and especially to the usual
Practice of all Creatures in Fear: but I was so embarrass'd with my
own frightful Ideas of the Thing, that I formed nothing but dismal Ima-
ginations to myself, even though I was now a great way off of it Some-
times I fancied it must be the Devil; and Reason joined in with me
upon this Supposition: For how should any other Thing in human
Shape come into the Place? Where was the Vessel that brought
them? What Marks were there of any other Footsteps? And how
was it possible a Man should come there? But then to think that
Satan should take human Shape upon him in such a Place where
there could be no manner of Occasion for it, but to leave the Print
of his Foot behind him, and that even for no Purpose too, for he
could not be sure I should see it; this was an Amusement the other
Way; I consider'd that the Devil might have found out abundance
of other Ways to have terrified me than this of the single Print of a
Foot That as I lived quite on the other Side of the Island, he
would never have been so simple to leave a Mark in a Place where it
was Ten Thousand to one whether I should ever see it or not, and in
the Sand too, which the first Surge of the Sea upon a high Wind
would have defac'd entirely: All this seemed inconsistent with the
Thing itself, and with all the Notions we usually entertain of the
Subtlety of the Devil.
Abundance of such Things as these assisted to argue me out of aft
Apprehensions of its being the Devil: And I presently concluded
then, that it must be some more dangerous Creature, (viz.) That it
must be some of the Savages of the main Land over against me, who
had wander'd out to Sea in their Canoes; and either driven by the
Currents, or by contrary Winds, had made the Island ; and had been on
Shore, but were gone away again to Sea, being as loth, perhaps, to have
stayed in this desolate Island, as I would have been to have had them.
While these Reflections were rolling upon my Mind, I was very
thankful in my Thoughts, that I was so happy as not to be there-
abouts at that Time, or that they did not see my Boat, by which they
would have concluded that some Inhabitants had been in the Place,
and perhaps have searched farther for me: Then terrible Thoughts
racked my Imagination about their having found my Boat, and that
there were People here; and that if so, I should certainly have them
come again in greater Numbers, and devour me; that if it should
happen so that they should not find me, yet they would find my En
closure, destroy all my Corn, carry away all my Flock of tame Goats,
and I ihoitM r.erish at last for mere Want ..
Thus my Fear banish'd all my religious Hope; all that former
Confidence in God which was founded upon such wonderful Experi-
ence as I had had of his Goodness, now vanished, as if he that had
fed me by Miracle hitherto, could not preserve by his Power the Pro-
vision which he had made for me by his Goodness: I reproach'd
myself with my Easiness, that would not sow any more Corn one
Year than would just serve me till the next Season, as if no Accident
could intervene to prevent my enjoying the Crop that was upon the
Ground; and this I thought so just a Reproof, that I resolv'd for the
future to have two or three Years' Corn beforehand, so that whatevei
might come, I might not perish for want of Bread.
How strange a Chequer-Work of Providence is the Life of Man!
and by what secret differing Springs are the Affections hurried about
as differing Circumstances present! To-day we love what to-morrow
we hate; to-day we seek what to-morrow we shun; to-day we desire
what to-morrow we fear; nay, even tremble at the Apprehensions of;
this was exemplified in me at this Time in the most lively Manner
imaginable: for I, whose only Affliction was, that I seemed banished
from human Society, that I was alone, circumscrib'd by the boundless
Ocean, cut off from Mankind, and condemn'd to what I called
silent Life; that I was as one whom Heaven thought not worthy to
be number'd among the Living, or to appear among the rest of his
Creatures; that to have seen one of my own Species would have
seemed to me a Raising me from Death to Life, and the greatest
Blessing that Heaven itself, next to the supreme Blessing of Salvation,
could bestow; / say, that I should now tremble at the very Appre-
hensions of seeing a Man, and was ready to sink into the Ground at
but the Shadow or silent Appearance of a Man's having set his Foot
in the Island.
Such is the uneven State of human Life: And it afforded me a
great many curious Speculations afterwards, when I had a little recovex'd
my first Surprise; I consider'd that this was the Station of Life the
infinitely wise and good Providence of God had determin'd for rne,
that as I could not foresee what the Ends of Divine Wisdom might be
in all this, so I was not to dispute his Sovereignty, who, as I was his
Creature, had an undoubted Right by Creation to govern and dispose
of me absolutely as he thought fit; and who, as I was a Creature who
had offended him, had likewise a judicial Right to condemn me to
•hat Punishment he thought fit; and that it was my Part to submit to
bear his Indignation, because I had sinned against him.
I then reflected that God, who was not only Righteous but Omni-
potent, as he had thought fit thus to punish and afflict me, so he was
able to deliver me; that if he did not think fit to do it, it was my un-
question'd Duty to resign myself absolutely and entirely to his Wifl;
and on the other Hand, it was my Duty also to hope in him, pray to
him, and quietly to attend the Dictates and Directions of his daily
Providence.
These Thoughts took me up many Hours, Days; nay, I may say,
Weeks and Months; and one particular Effect of my Cogitations on
this Occasion, I cannot omit, viz. One Morning early, lying in my
Bed, and filled with Thought about my Danger from the Appearance
of Savages, I found it discompos'd me very much, upon which those
Words of the Scripture came into my Thoughts, Call upon me in the
Day of Trouble, and I will deliver, and thou shall glorify me.
Upon this, rising cheerfully out of my Bed, my Heart was not only
comforted, but I was guided and encourag'd to pray earnestly to God
for Deliverance: When I had done praying, I took up my Bible, and
opening it to read, the first Words that presented to me, were, Wail
on the Lord, and be of good Cheer, and he shall strengthen thy Heart;
wait, I say, on the Lord. It is impossible to express the Comfort this
gave me. In answer I thankfully laid down the Book, and was no
more sad, at least, not on that Occasion.
In the middle of these Cogitations, Apprehensions and Reflections,
it came into my Thought one Day, that all this might be a mere
Chimera of my own; and that this Foot might be the Print of my
own Foot, when I came on Shore from my Boat; This cheered me
up a little too, and I began to persuade myself it was all a Delusion;
that it was nothing else but my own Foot, and why might not I come
that way from the Boat, as well as I was going that way to the Boat;
again, I consider'd also that I could by no Means tell for certain where
I had trod, and where I had not; and that if at last this was only the
Print of my own Foot, I had played the part of those Fools, who strive
to mate stories of Spectres, and Apparitions; and then are frighted IX
them more than anybody.
Now I began to take Courage, and to peep abroad again; for I ha»1
Dot stirred out of my Castle for three Days and Nights; so that J
began to starve for Provision; for I had little or nothing within
Doors, but some Barley Cakes and Water. Then I knew that my
Goats wanted to be milked too, which usually was my Evening Diver-
sion; and the poor Creatures were in great Pain and Inconvenience
for want of it; and indeed, it almost spoiled some of them, and almost
dried up their Milk.
Heartening myself therefore with the belief that this was nothing but
the Print of one of my own Feet, and so I might be truly said to start
at my own Shadow, I began to go abroad again, and went to my
Country House, to milk my Flock; but to see with what Fear I went
forward, how often I looked behind me, how I was ready every now
and then to lay down my Basket, and run for my Life, it would have
made anyone have thought I was haunted with an evil Conscience,
or that I had been lately most terribly frighted, and so indeed I had.
However, as I went down thus two or three Days, and having seen
nothing, I began to be a little bolder; and to think there was really
nothing in it, but my own Imagination: But I could not persuade
myself fully of this, till I should go down to the Shore again, and see
this Print of a Foot, and measure it by my own, and see if there was
any Similitude or Fitness, that I might be assur'd it was my own
Foot: But when I came to the Place, First, it appeared evidently
to me, that when I laid up my Boat, I could net possibly be on Shore
anywhere there about Secondly, When I came to measure the Mark
with my own Foot, I found my Foot not so large by a great deal;
both these Things filled my Head with new Imaginations, and gave me
the Vapours again, to the highest Degree; so that I shook with cold,
like one in an Ague: And I went Home again, filled with the Belief
that some Man or Men had been on Shore there; or in short, that
the Island was inhabited, and I might be surpris'd before I was
aware; and what course to take for my Security I knew not
O what ridiculous Resolution Men take, when possess'd with Fear!
It deprives them of the Use of those Means which Reason offers for
their Relief. The first Thing I propos'd to myself, was, to throw
down my Enclosures, and turn all my tame Cattle wild into the Woods,
that the Enemy might not find them; and then frequent the Island
in Prospect of the same, or the like Booty: Then to the simple
Thing of Digging up my two Corn Fields, that they might not find
such a Grain there, and still be prompted to frequent the Island;
then to demolish my Bower, and Tent, that they might not see any
Vestiges of Habitation, and be prompted to look farther, in order to
find out the Persons inhabiting.
These were the Subject of the first Night's Cogitation, after I was
come Home again, while the Apprehensions which had so over-run
my Mind were fresh upon me, and my Head was full of Vapours, as
above. Thus Fear of Danger is ten thousand Times more terrifying
than Danger itself, when apparent to the Eyes; and we find the
Burden of Anxiety greater by much, than the Evil which we are
anxious about; and which was worse than all this, I had not that
Reli ef in this Trouble from the Resignation I used to practise, that I
hop ed to have. I looked, I thought, like Saul, who complain'd not
only that the Philistines were upon him; but that God had forsaken
him; for I did not now take due Ways to compose my Mind, by
crying to God in my Distress, and resting upon his Providence, as I
had done before, for my Defence and Deliverance; which if I had
done, I had, at least, been more cheerfully supported under this new
Surprise, and perhaps carried through it with more Resolution.
This Confusion of my Thoughts kept me waking all Night; but in
the Morning I fell asleep, and having by the Amusement of my Mind,
been, as it were, tired, and my Spirits exhausted; I slept very roundly,
and waked much better compos'd than I had ever been before; and
now I began to think sedately; and upon the utmost Debate with
myself, I concluded, That this Island, which was so exceedingly
pleasant, fruitful, and no farther from the main Land than as I had
seen, was not so entirely abandon'd as I might imagine: That
although there were no stated Inhabitants who lived on the Spot;
yet that there might sometimes come Boats off from the Shore, who
either with Design, or perhaps never, but when they were driven by
cross Winds, might come to this Place.
That I had lived here fifteen Years now, and had not met with the
least Shadow or Figure of any People yet; and that if at any Time
they should be driven here, it was probable they went away again as
loon as ever they could, seeing they had never thought fit to fix there
upon any Occasion, to this Time.
That the most I could suggest any Danger from, was, from any
such casual accidental Landing of straggling People from the Main,
who, as it was likely if they were driven hither, were here against their
Wills; so they made no stay here, but went off again with all possible
Speed, seldom staying one Night on Shore, lest they »hould not have
the Help of the Tides, and Daylight back again; and that therefore
I had nothing to do but to consider of some safe Retreat, in Case I
ihould see any Savages land upon the Spot
Now I began sorely to repent, that I had dug my Cave so large, as
to bring a Door through again, which Door, as I said, came out
beyond where my Fortification joined to the Rock; upon maturely
considering this therefore, I resolv'd to draw me a second Fortifica-
tion, in the same Manner of a Semicircle, at a Distance from my
Wall, just where I had planted a double Row of Trees, about twelve
Years before, of which I made mention: These Trees having been
planted so thick before, they wanted but a few Piles to be driven
between them, that they should be thicker, and stronger, and my
Wall would be soon finish'd.
So that I had now a double Wall, and my outer Wall was thickened
with Pieces of Timber, old Cables, and everything I could think of,
to make it strong; having in it seven little Holes, about as big as I
might put my Arm out at: In the Inside of this, I thickened my
Wall to above ten Foot thick, with continual bringing Earth out of
my Cave, and laying it at the Foot of the Wall, and walking upon it;
and through the seven Holes, I contriv'd to plant the Muskets, of
which I took Notice, that I got seven on Shore out of the Ship;
these, 1 say, I planted like my Cannon, and fitted them into Frames
that held them like a Carriage, that so I could fire all the seven
Guns in two Minutes' Time: This Wall I was many a weary Month
a finishing, and yet never thought myself safe till it was done.
When this was done, I stuck all the Ground without my Wall, for
a great way every way, as full with Stakes or Sticks of the Osier-\ike
Wood, which I found so apt to grow, as they could well stand; inso-
much, that I believe I might set in near twenty thousand of them,
leaving a pretty large Space between them and my Wall, that I might
hive room to see an Enemy, and they might have no shelter from the
young Trees, if they attempted to approach my outer Wall
.
Thus in two Years' Time I had a thick Grove, and in five or six
Years' Time I had a Wood before my Dwelling, growing so monstrous
thick and strong, that it was indeed perfectly impassable; and no
Men of what kind soever, would ever imagine that there was anything
beyond it, much less a Habitation: As for the Way which I propos'd
to myself to go in and out, for I left no Avenue, it was by setting two
Ladders; one to a Part of the Rock which was low, and then broke
in, and left rocm to place another Ladder upon that; so when the
two Ladders were taken down, no Man living could come down to
me without mischieving himself; and if they had come down, they
were still on the Outside of my outer Wall.
Thus I took all the Measures human Frudence could suggest for
my own Preservation; and it will be seen at length, that they were
not altogether without just Reason; though I foresaw nothing at that
Time, more than my mere Fear suggested to me.
While this was doing, I was not altogether Careless of my other
Affairs; for I had a great Concern upon me, for my little Herd of
Goats; they were not only a present Supply to me upon every
Occasion, and began to be sufficient to me, without the Expense of
Powder and Shot; but also without the Fatigue of Hunting after the
wild Ones, and I was loth to lose the Advantage of them, and to
have all to nurse up over again.
To this Purpose, after long Consideration, I could think of but two
Ways to preserve them; one was to find another convenient Place to
dig a Cave Under-ground, and to drive them into it every Night;
and the other was to enclose two or three little Bits of Land, remote
from one another and as much conceal'd as I could, where I might
keep about half a Dozen young Goats in each Place: So that if
any Disaster happen'd to the Flock in general, I might be able to
raise them again with little Trouble and Time: And this, though it
would require a great deal of Time and Labour, I thought was the
most rational Design.
Accordingly I spent some Time to find out the most retir'd Tarts
of the Island; and I pitched upon one which was as private indeed
as my Heart could wish for; it was a little damp Piece of Ground in
the Middle of the hollow and thick Woods, where, as is observ'd, I
almost lost myself once before, endeavouring to come back that Way
from the Eastern Part of the Island: Here I found a clear Piece of
Land near three Acres, so surrounded with Woods, that it was almost
an Enclosure by Nature, at least it did not want near so much Labour
to make it so, as the other Pieces of Ground I had worked so
hard at
I immediately went to Work with this Piece of Ground, and in less
than a Month's Time, I had so fenced it round, that my Flock or
Herd, call it which you please, who were not so wild now as at first
they might be supposed to be, were well enough secur'd in it So
without any further Delay, I removed ten young She-goats and two
He-goats to this Piece; and when they were there, I continued to
perfect the Fence till I had made it as secure as the other, which,
however, I did at more Leisure, and it took me up more Time by a
great deal.
All this Labour I was at the Expense of, purely from my Apprehen
sions on the Account of the Print of a Man's Foot which I had seen;
for as yet I never saw any human Creature come near the Island, and
I had now lived two Years under these Uneasinesses, which indeed
made my Life much less comfortable than it was before; as may well
be imagin'd by any who know what it is to live in the constant Snare
of the Fear of Man; and this I must observe with Grief too, that the
Discomposure of my Mind had too great Impressions also upon the
religious Part of my Thoughts, for the Dread and Terror of falling
into the Hands of Savages and Cannibals, lay so upon my Spirits, that
I seldom found myself in a due Temper for Application to my Maker,
at least not with the sedate Calmness and Resignation of Soul which
I was wont to do; I rather prayed to God as under great Affliction
and Pressure of Mind, surrounded with Danger, and in Expectation
every Night of being murder'd and devour^ before Morning; and I
must testify from my Experience, that a Temper of Peace, Thankful-
ness, Love and Affection, is much more the proper Frame for
Prayer than that of Terror and Discomposure; and that under the
Dread of Mischief impending, a Man is no more fit for a comforting
Performance of the Duty of praying to God, than he is for Repentance
on a sick Bed: For these Discomposures affect the Mind as the
others do the Body; and the Discomposure of the Mind must
necessarily be as great a Disability as that of the Body, and much
greater, Praying to God being properly an Act of the Mind, not of
the Body.
But to go on; After I had thus secur'd one Part of my little living
Stock, I went about the whole Island, searching for another private
Place, to make such another Deposit; when wandering more to the
West Point of the Island, than I had ever done yet; and looking out
to Sea, I thought I saw a Boat upon the Sea, at a great Distance; I
had found a Prospective-Glass, or two, in one of the Seamen's Chests,
which I saved out of our Ship; but I had it not about me, and
this was so remote, that I could not tell what to make of it;
though I looked at it till my Eyes were not ?ble to hold to look any
tof.ger; whether it was a Boat, or not, I do not know; but as 1
descended from the Hill, I could see no more of it, so I gave it
over; only I resolv'd to go no more out without a Prospective-
Glass in my Pocket
When I was come down the Hill, to the End of the Island, where
indeed I had never been before, I was presently convinc'd, that the
Print of a Man's Foot, was not such a strange Thing in the Island as I
imagin'd; and but that it was a special Providence that I was cast upon
the Side of the Island, where the Savages never came: I should
easily have known, that nothing was more frequent than for the
Canoes from the Main, when they happen'd to be a little too far out
at Sea, to shoot over to that Side of the Island for Harbour; like-
wise as they often met, and fought in their Canoes, the Victors having
taken any Prisoners, would bring them over to this Shore, where
according to their dreadful Customs, being all Cannibals, they would
kill and eat them; of which hereafter.
When I was come down the Hill, to the Shore, as I said above,
being the S. IV. Point of the Island, I was perfectly confounded and
amaz'd; nor is it possible for me to express the Horror of my Mind,
at seeing the Shore spread with Skulls, Hands, Feet, and other Bones
of human Bodies; and particularly I observ'd a Place where there
had been a Fire made, and a Circle dug in the Earth, like a Cockpit,
where it is suppos'd the Savage Wretches had sat down to their in-
human Feastings upon the Bodies of their Fellow-Creatures.
I was so astonish'd with the Sight of these Things, that I enter-
tain'd ro Notions of any Danger to myself from it for a long while;
All my Apprehensions were buried in the Thoughts of such a Pitch
of inhuman, hellish Brutality, and the Horror of the Degeneracy of
Human Nature; which though I had heard of often, yet I never had
so near a View of before; in short, I turned away my Face from the
horrid Spectacle; my Stomach grew sick, and I was just at the Point
of Fainting, when Nature discharg'd the Disorder from my Stomach;
and having vomited with an uncommon Violence, I was a little
:eliev'd; but could not bear to stay in the Place a Moment; so I
gat me up the Hill again, with all the Speed I could, and walked on
towards my own Habitation.
When I came a little out of that Part of the Island, I stood still
awhile as amaz'd; and then recovering myself, I looked up with the
utmost Affection of my Soul, and with a Flood of Tears in ras Eyes,
gave God Thanks that had cast my first Lot in a Part of the World,
where I was distinguish'd from such dreadful Creatures as these; and
that though I had esteem'd my present Condition very miserable,
had yet given me so many Comforts in it, that I had still more to
give Thanks for than to complain of; and this above all, that I had
even in this miserable Condition been comforted with the Knowledge
of himself, and the Hope of his Blessing, which was a Felicity more
than sufficiently equivalent to all the Misery which I had sufier'd, or
could suffer.
In this Frame of Thankfulness, I went Home to my Castle, and
began to be much easier now, as to the Safety of my Circumstances,
than ever I was before; for I obseiVd, that these Wretches never
came to this Island in search of what they could get; perhaps not
seeking, not wanting, or not expecting anything here; and having
often, no doubt, been up in the cover'd woody Part of it, without
finding anything to their Purpose. I knew I had been here now
almost eighteen Years, and never saw the least Footsteps of Human
Creature there before; and I might be here eighteen more, as entirely
conceal'd as I was now, if I did not discover myself to them, which
I had no manner of Occasion to do, it being my only Business to
keep myself entirely conceal'd where I was, unless I found a better
sort of Creatures than Cannibals to make myself known to.
Yet I entertain'd such an Abhorrence of the Savage Wretches, that
I have been speaking of, and of the wretched inhuman Custom of
their devouring and eating one another up, that I continu'd pensive,
and sad, and kept close within my own Circle for almost two Years
after this: When I say my own Circle, I mean by it, my three Plan-
tations, viz. my Castle, my Country Seat, which I called my Bower,
and my Enclosure in the Woods; nor did I look after this for any
other Use than as an Enclosure for my Goats; for the Aversion
which Nature gave me to these hellish Wretches, was such, that I was
fearful of seeing them, as of seeing the Devil himself; nor did I so
much as go to look after my Boat, in all this time; but began rather
to think of making me another; for I could not think of ever making
any more Attempts, to bring the other Boat round the Island to me,
lest I should meet with some of these Creatures at Sea, in which, if I
had happen'd to have fallen into their Hands, I knew what would
have been my Ix>t
Time however, and the Satisfaction I had, that I was in no Danger
of being discover'd by these People, began to wear off my Uneasiness
about them; and I began to live just in the same compos'd Manner
as before; only with this Difference, that I used more Caution, and
kept my Eyes more about me than I did before, lest I should happen
to be seen by any of them; and particularly, I was more cautious of
firing my Gun, lest any of them being on the Island, should happen
to hear of it; and it was therefore a very good Providence to me, that
I had furnish'd myself with a tame Breed of Goats, that I needed not
hunt any more about the Woods, or shoot at them; and if I did
catch any of them after this, it was by Traps and Snares, as I had done
before; so that for two Years after this, I believe I never fired my
Gun once off, though I never went out without it; and which was
more, as I had saved three Pistols out of the Ship, I always carried
them out with me, or at least two of them, sticking them in my Goat-
skin Belt; also I furbish'd up one of the great Cutlasses, that I had
out of the Ship, and made me a Belt to put it on also; so that I was
now a most formidable Fellow to look at, when I went abroad, if you
add to the former Description of myself, the Particular of two Pistols,
and a great broad Sword, hanging at my Side in a Belt, but without
a Scabbard.
Things going on thus, as I have said, for some Time, I seemed,
excepting these Cautions, to be reduc'd to my former calm, sedate
Way of Living, all these Things tended to showing me more and
more how far my Condition was from being miserable, compar'd to
some others; nay, to many other Particulars of Life, which it might
have pleased God to have made my Lot It put me upon reflecting,
How little repining there would be among Mankind, at any Condition
of Life, if People would rather compare their Condition with those
that are worse, in order to be thankful, than be always comparing
them with those which are better, to assist their Murmurings and
Complainings.
As in my present Condition there were not really many Things
which I wanted; so indeed I thought that the Frights I had been
in about these Savage Wretches, and the Concern I had been in for
my own Preservation, had taken off the Edge of my Invention for my
own Conveniences; and I had dropped a good Design, which I had
once bent my Thoughts too much upon; and that was, to try if I
could not make some of my Barley into Malt, and then try to brew
a) self some Beer: This was really a whimsical Thought, and I re-
prov'd myself often for the Simplicity of it; for I presently saw there
would be the Want of several Things necessary to the making my
Beer, that it would be impossible for me to supply: as First, Casks
to preserve it in, which was a Thing, that as I have observ'd already,
I could never compass; no, though I spent not many Days, bat
Weeks, nay, Months in attempting it, but to no purpose. In the next
Place, I had no Hops to make it keep, no Yeast to make it work, no
Copper or Kettle to make it boil; and yet all these Things, notwith-
standing, I verily believe, had not these Things interven'd, I mean
the Frights and Terrors I was in about the Savages, I had undertaken
it, and perhaps brought it to pass too; for I seldom gave anything
over without accomplishing it, when I once had it in my Head enough
to begin it
But my Invention now run quite another Way; for Night and Day
I could think of nothing but how I might destroy some of these
Monsters in their cruel bloody Entertainment, and if possible, save
the Victim they should bring hither to destroy. It would take up a
larger Volume than this whole Work is intended to be, to set down
all the Contrivances I hatched, or rather brooded upon in my Thought,
for the destroying these Creatures, or at least frighting them, so as to
prevent their coming hither any more; but all was abortive, nothing
could be possible to take effect, unless I was to be there to do it
myself; and what could one Man do among them, when perhaps there
might be twenty or thirty of them together, with their Darts, or their
Bows and Arrows, with which they could shoot as true to a Mark, as
I could with my Gun?
Sometimes I contriv'd to dig a Hole under the Place where they
made their Fire, and put in five or six Pound of Gunpowder, which
when they kindled their Fire, would consequently take Fire, and blow
up all that was near it; but as in the first Place I should be very loth
to waste so much Powder upon them, my Store being now within the
Quantity of one Barrel; so neither could I be sure of its going off,
at any certain Time, when it might surprise them, and at best, that
it would do little more than just blow the Fire about their Ears and
fright them, but not sufficient to make them forsake the Place; so I
laid it aside, and then propos'd, that I would place myself in Ambush,
in some convenient Place, with my three Guns, all double loaded;
and in the middle of their bloody Ceremony, let fly at them, when I
should be sure to kill or wound perhaps two or three at every Shoot;
»5'
and then falling in upon them with my three Pistols, and my Sword,
I made no doubt, but that if there was twenty I should kill them all:
This Fancy pleased my Thoughts for some Weeks, and I was so full
of it, that I often dreamed of it; and sometimes that I was just going
to let fly at them in my Sleep.
I went so far with it in my Imagination, that I employ'd myself
severai Days to find out proper Places to put myself in Ambuscade,
as I said, to w,<tch for them; and I went frequently to the Place
itself, which was now grown more familiar to me ; and especially while
my Mind was thus filled with Thoughts of Revenge, and of a bloody
putting twenty or thirty of tliem to the Sword, as I may call it; the
Horror I had at the Place, and at the Signals of the barbarous
Wretches devouring one another, abated my Malice.
Well, at length I found a Place in the Side of the Hill, where I was
satisfied I might securely wait till I saw any of their Boats coming,
and might then, even before they would be ready to come on Shore,
convey myself unseen into Thickets of Trees, in one of which
there was a Hollow large enough to conceal me entirely; and
where I might sit and observe all their bloody Doings, and
take my full aim at their Heads, when they were so close to-
gether, as that it would be next to impossible that I should miss
my Shoot, or that I could fail wounding three or four of them at the
first Shoot
In this Place then I resolv'd to fix my Design, and accordingly I
prepared two Muskets and my ordinary Fowling Piece. The two
Muskets I loaded with a Brace of Slugs each, and four or five smaller
Bullets, about the Size of Pistol Bullets; and the Fowling Piece I
loaded with near a Handful of Swan-shot, of the largest Size; I also
loaded my Pistols with about four Bullets each, and in this Posture,
well provided with Ammunition for a second and third Charge, I pre-
par'd myself for my Expedition.
After I had thus laid the Scheme of my Design, and in my Imagi-
nation put it in Practice, I continually made my Tour every Morning
up to the Top of the Hill, which was from my Castle, as I called it,
about three Miles, or more, to see if I could observe any Boats upon
the Sea, coming near the Island, or standing over towards it; but
I began to tire of this hard Duty, after I had for two or three Months
constantly kept my Watch; but came always back without any
Discovery, there having not in all that Time been the least Appear
ance, not only on or near the Shore, but not on the whole Ocean, so
far as my Eyes or Glasses could reach every Way.
As long as I kept up my daily Tour to the Hill, to look out; so long
also I kept up the Vigour of my Design, and my Spirits seemed to be
all the while in a suitable Form, for so outrageous an Execution as
the killing twenty or thirty naked Savages, for an Offence which I had
not at all entered into a Discussion of in my Thoughts, any farther
than my Passions were at first fired by the Horror I conceiv'd at the
unnatural Custom of that People of the Country, who it seems had
been suffer'd by Providence in his wise Disposition of the World, to
have no other Guide than that of their own abominable and vitiated
Passions; and consequently were left, and perhaps had been so for
some Ages, to act such horrid Things, and receive such dreadful
Customs, as nothing but Nature entirely abandon'd of Heaven, and
acted by some hellish Degeneracy, could have run them into: But
now when, as I have said, I began to be weary of the fruitless Excur-
sion, which I had made so long, and so far, every Morning in vain, so
my Opinion of the Action itself began to alter, and I began with
cooler and calmer Thoughts to consider what it was I was going to
engage in. What Authority, or Call I had, to pretend to be Judge
and Executioner upon these Men as Criminals, whom Heaven had
thought fit for so many Ages to suffer unpunish'd, to go on, and to be
as it were, the Executioners of his Judgments one upon another. How
far these People were Offenders against me, and what Right I had to
engage in the Quarrel of that Blood, which they shed promiscuously
one upon another. I debated this very often with myself thus; How
do I know what God himself judges in this particular Case; it is
certain these People either do not commit this as a Crime; it is not
against their own Consciences reproving, or their Light reproaching
them. They do not know it to be an Offence, and then commit it in
Defiance of Divine Justice, as we do in almost all the Sins we commit
They think it no more a Crime to kill a Captive taken in War, than
we do to kill an Ox; nor to eat human Flesh, than we do to eat
Mutton.
When I had consider'd this a little, it follow'd necessarily, that I was
certainly in the Wrong in it, that these People were not Murderers, in
the Sense that I had before condemn'd them, in my Thoughts; any
more than those Christians were Murderers, who often put to Death
the Prisoners taken in Battle; or more frequently, upon many Occsr
sions, put whole Troops of Men to the Sword, without giving Quarter,
though they threw down their Arms and submitted.
In the next Place it occurr'd to me, that albeit the Usage they thus
gave one another, was thus brutish and inhuman; yet it was really
nothing to me: These People had done me no Injury. That if they
attempted me, or I saw it necessary for my immediate Preservation to
fall upon them, something might be said for it; but that as I was yet
out of their Power, and they had really no Knowledge of me, and
consequently no Design upon me; and therefore it could not be just
for me to fall upon them. That this would justify the Conduct of the
Spaniards in all their Barbarities practis'd in America, and where
they destroy'd Millions of these People, who however they were
Idolaters and Barbarians, and had several bloody and barbarous
Rites in their Customs, such as sacrificing human Bodies to their Idols,
were yet, as to the Spaniards, very innocent People; and that the
rooting them out of the Country, is spoken of with the utmost Ab-
horrence and Detestation, by even the Spaniards themselves, at this
Time; and by all other Christian Nations of Europe, as a mere
Butchery, a bloody and unnatural Piece of Cruelty, unjustifiable
either to God or Man; and such, as for which the very Name of a
Spaniard is reckon'd to be frightful and terrible to all People of
Humanity, or of Christian Compassion: As if the Kingdom of Spain
were particularly Eminent for the Product of a Race of Men, who
were without Principles of Tenderness, or the common Bowels of
Pity to the Miserable, which is reckon'd to be a Mark of generous
Temper in the Mind.
These Considerations really put me to a Pause, and to a kind of a
Full-stop ; and I began by little and little to be off of my Design, and
to conclude, I had taken wrong Measures in my Resolutions to attack
the Savages; that it was not my Business to meddle with them, un- 1
less they first attack'd me, and this it was my Business if possible to
prevent; but that if I were discover'd, and attack'd, then I knew my
\. Duty.
On the other hand, I argu'd with myself, That this really was the way
not to deliver myself, but entirely to ruin and destroy myself; for un-
less I was sure to kill every one that not only should be on Shore at
that Time, but that should ever come on Shore afterwards, if but one
of them escap'd to tell their Country People what had happen'd, they
would come over again by Thousands to revenge the Death of their
Fellows, and I should only bring upon myself a certain Destruction,
which at present I had no manner of occasion for.
Upon the whole I concluded, That neither in Principles nor in
Policy, I ought one way or other to concern myself in this affair.
That my Business was by all possible Means to conceal myself from
them, and not to leave the least Signal to them to guess by, that
there were any living Creatures upon the Island; I mean of human
Shape.
Religion joined in with this Prudential, and I was convinc'd now
many Ways, that I was perfectly out of my Duty, when I was laying
all my Bloody Schemes for the Destruction of innocent Creatures, I
mean innocent as to me: As to the Crimes they were guilty of to-
wards one another, I had nothing to do with them; they were
National, and I ought to leave them to the Justice of God, who is the
Governor of Nations, and knows how by National Punishments to
make just Retribution for National Offences; and to bring public
Judgments upon those who offend in a public Manner, by such Ways
as best pleases him.
This appear'd so clear to me now, that nothing was a greater
Satisfaction to me, than that I had not been suffer'd to do a Thing
which I now saw so much Reason to believe would have been no
less a Sin, than that of wilful Murder, if I had committed it; and I
gave most humble Thanks on my Knees to God, that had thus de-
liver'd me from Blood-Guiltiness; beseeching him to grant me the
Protection of his Providence, that I might not fall into the Hands
of the Barbarians; or that I might not lay my Hands upon them,
unless I had a more clear Call from Heaven to do it, in Defence of
my own Life.
In this Disposition I continu'd, for near a Year after this; and so
far was I from desiring an Occasion for falling upon these Wretches,
that in all that Time, I never once went up the Hill to see whether
there were any of them in Sight, or to know whether any of them
had been on Shore there, or not, that I might not be tempted to re-
new any of my Contrivances against them, or be provok'd by anj
Advantage which might present itself, to fall upon them; only this I
did, I went and remov'd my Boat, which I had on the other Side
the Island, and carried it down to the East End of the whole Island,
where I ran it into a little Cove which I found under some high Rocks,
and where I knew, by Reason of Currents, the Savages durst no^
at least would not come with their Boats, upon any Account whatso-
ever.
With my Boat I carried away everything that I had left there be-
longing to her, though not necessary for the bare going thither, vit.
A Mast and Sail which I had made for her, and a thing like an An-
chor, but indeed which could not be called either Anchor or Grap-
pling; however, it was the best I could make of its kind: all these
I remov'd, that there might not be the least Shadow of any Dis-
covery, or any Appearance of any Boat, or of any human Habitation
upon the Island.
Besides this, I kept myself, as I said, more retir'd than ever, and
seldom went from my Cell, other than upon my constant Employment,
viz. To milk my She-Goats, and manage my little Flock, in the
Wood; which as it was quite on another Part of the Island, was
quite out of Danger; for certain it is, that these Savage People who
sometimes haunted this Island, never came with any Thoughts of
finding anything here; and consequently never wandered off from
the Coast; and I doubt not, but they might have been several Times
on the Shore, after my Apprehensions of them had made me cautious
as well as before; and indeed, I looked back with some Horror upon
the Thoughts of what my Condition would have been, if I had
chopped upon them, and been discover'd before that, when naked
and unarm'd, except with one Gun, and that loaded often only with
small Shot, I walked everywhere peeping, and peeping about the
Island, to see what I could get; what a Surprise should I have been
in, if when I discover'd the Print of a Man's Foot, I had instead of
that, seen afteen or twenty Savages, and found them pursuing me, and
by the Swiftness of their Running, no Possibility of my escaping
them.
The Thoughts of this sometimes sunk my very Soul within me,
*nd distress'd my Mind so much, that I could not soon recover it,
to think what I should have done, and how I not only should
not have been able to resist them, but even should not have had
Presence of Mind enough to do what I might have done; much less,
what now after so much Consideration and Preparation I might be
able to do: Indeed, after serious thinking of these Things, I should
be very Melancholy, and sometimes it would last a great while; but
I resolv'd it at last all into Thankfulness to that Providence, which had
deliver'd me from so many unseen Dangers, and had kept me from
those Mischiefs which I could no way have been the Agent in de-
livering myself from; because I had not the least Notion of any such
Thing depending, or the least Supposition of it being possible.
This renewal a Contemplation, which often had come to my
Thoughts in former Time, when first I began to see the merciful
Dispositions of Heaven, in the Dangers we run through in this Life.
How wonderfully we are deliver'd, when we know nothing of it
How when we are in (a Quandary, as we call it) a Doubt or Hesita-
tion, whether to go this Way, or that Way, a secret Hint shall direct
us this Way, when we intended to go that Way; nay, when Sense,
our own Inclination, and perhaps Business has called to go the other
Way, yet a strange Impression upon the Mind, from we know not
what Springs, and by we know not what Power, shall overrule us to
go this Way; and.it shall afterwards appear, that had we gone that
Way which we should have gone, and even to our Imagination ought
to have gone, we should have been ruin'd and lost: Upon these,
and many like Reflections, I afterwards made it a certain Rule with
me, That whenever I found those secret Hints, or pressings of my
Mind, to doing, or not doing anything that presented; or to going
this Way, or that Way, I never failed to obey the secret Dictate;
though I knew no other Reason for it, than that such a Pressure, or
such a Hint hung upon my Mind : I could give many Examples of the
Success of this Conduct in the Course of my Life; but more espe-
cially in the latter Part of my inhabiting this unhappy Island; be-
sides many Occasions which it is very likely I might have taken
Notice of, if I had seen with the same Eyes then, that I saw with
now: But it is never too late to be wise; and I cannot but advise
all considering Men, whose Lives are attended with such extra-
ordinary Incidents as mine, or even not so extraordinary, not to
slight such secret Intimations of Providence, let them come from
what invisible Intelligence they will, that I shall not discuss, and
perhaps cannot account for; but certainly they are a Proof of the
Converse of Spirits, and the secret Communication between those
embody'd, and those unembody'd; and such a Proof as can never be
withstood : Of which I shall have Occasion to give some very remark-
able Instances, in the Remainder of my solitary Residence in this
dismal Place.
I believe the Reader of this will not think strange, if I confess that
these Anxieties, these constant Dangers I lived in, and the Concern
that was now upon me, put an End to all Invention, and to all the
Contrivances that I had laid for my future Accommodations and Con-
veniences. I had the Care of my Safety more now upon my Hands,
than that of my Food. I cared not to drive a Nail, or chop a Stick of
Wood now, for fear the Noise I should make should be heard; much
less would I fire a Gun, for the same Reason; and above all, I was
intolerably uneasy at making any Fire, lest the Smoke which is visible
at a great Distance in the Day should betray me; and for this Reason
I remov'd that Part of my Business which requir'd Fire; such as
burning of Pots, and Pipes, Grc. into my new Apartment in the
Woods, where after I had been some Time, I found to my unspeak-
able Consolation, a mere natural Cave in the Earth, which went in a
vast way, and where, I dare say, no Savage, had he been at the
Mouth of it, would be so hardy as to venture in, nor indeed, would
any Man else; but one who like me, wanted nothing so much as a
safe Retreat
The Mouth of this Hollow was at the Bottom of a great Rock where
by mere Accident, (I would say, if I did not see abundant Reason to
ascribe all such Things now to Providence) I was cutting down some
thick Branches of Trees, to make Charcoal; and before I go on, I
must observe the Reason of my making this Charcoal; which was thus:
I was afraid of making a Smoke about my Habitation, as I said
before; and yet I could not live there without baking my Bread,
cooking my Meat, cVc. so I contriv'd to bur n some Wood here, as I
had seen done in England, under Turf, until it became Chark, or dry
Coal; and then putting the Fire out, I preserv'd the Coal to carry
Home, and perform the other Services which Fire was wanting for at
Home, without Danger of Smoke.
But this is by the by: While I was cutting down some Wood here,
I perceiv'd that behind a very thick Branch of low Brushwood, or
Underwood, there was a kind of hollow Place; I was curious to look
into it, and getting with Difficulty into the Mouth of it, I found it was
pretty large; that is to say, sufficient for me to stand upright in it,
and perhaps another with me; but I must confess to you, I made
more haste out than I did in, when looking farther into the Place,
and which was perfectly dark, I saw two broad shining Eyes of some
Creature, whether Devil or Man I knew not, which twinkled like two
Stars, the dim Light from the Cave's Mouth shining directly in and
making the Reflection.
However, after some Pause, I recover^ myself, and began to call
myself a thousand Fools, and tell myself, that he that was afraid to see
the Devil, was not fit to live twenty Years in an Island all alone; and
that I durst to believe there was nothing in this Cave that was more
frightful than myself; upon this, plucking up my Courage, I took up
a great Firebrand, and in I rushed again, with the Stick flaming in my
Hand; I had not gone three Steps in, but I was almost as much
frighted as I was before; for I heard a very loud Sigh, like that of a
Man in some Pain„and it was follow'd by a broken Noise, as if of
Words half express'd, and then a deep Sigh again: I stepped back,
and was indeed struck with such a Surprise, that it put me into a cold
Sweat; and if I had had a Hat on my Head, I will not answer for it,
that my Hair might not have lifted it off. But still plucking up my
Spirits as well as I could, and encouraging myself a little with con-
sidering that the Power and Presence of God was everywhere, and
was able to protect me; upon this I stepped forward again, and by
the Light of the Firebrand, holding it up a little over my Head, I saw
lying on the Ground a most monstrous frightful old He-goat, just
making his Will, as we say, and gasping for Life, and dying indeed of
mere old Age.
I stirred him a little to see if I could get him out, and he essay'd
to get up, but was not able to raise himself; and I thought with
myself, he might even lie there; for if he had frighted me so, he
would certainly fright any of the Savages, if any of them should be so
hardy as to come in there, while he had any Life in him.
I was now recover'd from my Surprise, and began to look round
me, when I found the Cave was but very small, that is to say, it might
be about twelve Foot over, but in no manner of Shape, either round
or square, no Hands having ever been employ'd in making it, but
those of mere Nature: I obseiVd also, that there was a Place at the
farther Side of it, that went in farther, but was so low, that it requir'd
me to creep upon my Hands and Knees to go into it, and whither I
went I knew not; so having no Candle, I gave it over for some Time;
but resolv'd to come again the next Day, provided with Candles, and
a Tinder-box, which I had made of the Lock of one of the Muskets,
with some Wildfire in the Pan.
Accordingly, the next Day I came provided with six large Candles
of my own making; for I made very good Candles now of Goat's
Tallow; and going into this low Place, I was oblig'd to creep upon

all Fours, as I have said, almost ten Yards; which by the Way, I
thought was a Venture bold enough, considering that I knew not how
far it might go, nor what was beyond it When-1 was got through
the Strait, I found the Roof rose higher up, I believe near twenty
Foot; but never was such a glorious Sight seen in the Island, I dare
say, as it was, to look round the Sides and Roof of this Vault, or
Cave; the Walls reflected a hundred thousand Lights to me from my
two Candles; what it was in the Rock, whether Diamonds, or any other
precious Stones, or Gold, which I rather suppos'd it to be, I knew not
The Place I was in, was a most delightful Cavity, or Grotto, of its
kind, as could be expected, though perfectly dark; the Floor was
dry and level, and had a sort of small loose Gravel upon it, so that
there was no nauseous or venomous Creature to be seen, neither was
there any damp or wet on the Sides or Roof: The only Difficulty
in it was the Entrance, which however, as it was a Place of Security,
and such a Retreat as I wanted, I thought that was a Convenience;
so that I was really rejoic'd at the Discovery, and resolv'd without
any Delay, to bring some of those Things which I was most anxious
about, to this Place; particularly, I resolv'd to bring hither my
Magazine of Powder, and all my spare Arms, viz. Two Fowling-
Pieces, for I had three in all; and three Muskets, for of them I had
eight in all; so I kept at my Castle only five, which stood ready
mounted like Pieces of Cannon, on my outmost Fence; and were
ready also to take out upon any Expedition.
Upon this Occasion of removing my Ammunition, I took Occasion
to open the Ban el of Powder which I took up out of the Sea, and
which had been wet; and I found that the Water had penetrated
about three or four Inches into the Powder, on every Side, which
caking and growing hard, had preserv'd the inside like a Kernel in a
Shell; so that I had near sixty Pound of very good Powder in the
Centre of the Cask, and this was an agreeable Discovery to me at
that Time; so I carried all away thither, never keeping above two or
three Pound of Powder with me in my Castle, for fear of a Surprise
of any Kind: I also carried thither all the Lead I had left for Bullets.
I fancied myself now like one of the ancient Giants, which are
said to live in Caves, and Holes, in the Rocks, where none could come
at them; for I persuaded myself while I was here, if five hundred
Savages were to hunt me, they could never find me out; or if they
did. they would not venture to attack me here.
The old Goat who I found expiring, died in the Mouth of the Cave,
6ie next Day after I made this Discovery; and I found it much easier
to dig a great Hole there, and throw him in, and cover him with
Earth, than to drag him out; so I interr'd him there, to prevent the
9ffence to my Nose.
I was now in my twenty-third Year of Residence in this Island, and
was so naturalis'd to the Place, and to the Manner of Living, that
could I have but enjoy'd the Certainty that no Savages would come
to the Place to disturb me, I could have been content to have capi-
tulated for spending the rest of my Time there, even to the last Mo-
ment, until I had laid me down and died, like the old Goat in the
Cave. I had also arriv'd to some little Diversions and Amusements,
which made the Time pass more pleasantly with me a great deal, than
it did before; as First, I had taught my Poll, as I noted before, to
speak; and he did it so familiarly, and talked so articulately and plain,
that it was very pleasant to me; and he lived with me no less than
six-and-twenty Years: How long he might live afterwards, I know
not; though I know they have a Notion in the Brasils, that they live
a hundred Years; perhaps poor Poll may be alive there still, calling
after Poor Robin Crusoe, to this Day. I wish no Englishman the ill
Luck to come there and hear him; but if he did, he would certainly
believe it was the Devil. My Dog was a very pleasant and loving
Companion to me, for no less than sixteen Years of my Time, and
then died, of mere old Age; as for my Cats, they multiplied, as I have
observ'd, to that Degree, that I was oblig'd to shoot several of them
at first, to keep them from devouring me and all I had; but at lengthy
when the two old Ones I brought with me were gone, and after some
Time continually driving them from me, and letting them have no
Provision with me, they all ran wild into the Woods, except two or
three Favourites, which I kept tame; and whose Young when they
had any, I always drowned; and these were part of my Family:
Besides these, I always kept two or three household Kids about me,
who I taught to feed out of my Hand; and I had two more Parrots
which talked pretty well, and would all call Robin Crusoe; but none
like my first; nor indeed did I take the Pains with any of them that
I had done with him. I had also several tame Sea-Fowls, whose
Names I know not, who I caught upon the Shore, and cut their
Wings; and the little Stakes which I had planted before my Castle
Wall being now ($rown up to a good thick Grove, these Fowls all lived
among these low Trees, and bred there, which was very agreeable to
me; so that, as I said above, I began to be very well contented with
the Life I led, if it might but have been secur'd from the dread of
the Savages.
But it was otherwise directed; and it may not be amiss for all
People who shall meet with my Story, to make this just Observation
from it, viz. How frequently in the Course of our Lives, the Evil
which in itself we seek most to shun, and which when we are falleq
into it, is the most dreadful to us, is oftentimes the very Means or
Door of our Deliverance, by which alone we can be raised again from
the Affliction we are fallen into. I could give many Examples of this
in the Course of my unaccountable Life; but in nothing was it more
particularly remarkable, than in the Circumstances of my last Years
of solitary Residence in this Island.
It was now the Month of December, as I said above, in my twenty-
third Year; and this being the Southern Solstice, for Winter I cannot
call it, was the particular Time of my Harvest, and requir'd my being
pretty much abroad in the Fields, when going out pretty early in the
Morning, even before it was thorough Daylight, I was surpris'd with
seeing a Light of some Fire upon the Shore, at a Distance from me,
of about two Mjle towards the End of the Island, where I had
observ'd some Savages had been as before; but not on the other
Side; but to my great Affliction, it was on my Side of the Island.
I was indeed terribly surpris'd at the Sight, and stepped short
within my Grove, not daring to go out, least I might be surpris'd; and
yet I had no more Peace within, from the Apprehensions I had, that
if these Savages in rambling over the Island, should find my Corn
standing, or cut, or any of my Works and Improvements, they would
immediately conclude, that there were People in the Place, and would
then never give over till they had found me out: In this Extremity
I went back directly to my Castle, pulled up the Ladder after me, and
made all Things without look as wild and natural as I could.
Then I prepar'd myself within, putting myself in a Posture of
Defence; I loaded all my Cannon, as I called them; that is to say,
my Muskets, which were mounted upon my new Fortification, and all
my Pistols, and resoVd to defend myself to the last Gasp, not for-
getting seriously to commend myself to the Divine Protection, and
earnestly to pray to God to deliver me out of the Hands of the
Barbarians; and in this Posture I continu'd about two Hours; but
:<T»
ADVENTURES OP
began to be mighty impatient for Intelligence abroad, for I had no
Spies to send out
After sitting a while longer, and musing what I should do in this
Case, I was not able to bear sitting in Ignorance any longer; so
setting up my Ladder to the Side of the Hill, where there was a flat
Place, as I observ'd before, and then pulling the Ladder up after me,
I set it up again, and mounted to the Top of the Hill; and pulling
out my Perspective-Glass, which I had taken on Purpose, I laid me
down flat on my Belly, on the Ground, and began to look for the
Place; I presently found there was no less than nine naked Savages,
sitting round a small Fire, they had made, not to warm them; for they
had no need of that, the Weather being extreme hot; but as I
tuppos'd, to dress some of their barbarous Diet of human Flesh,

which they had brought with them, whether alive or dead I ccuid
not know.
They had two Canoes with them, which they had hauled up upon
the Shore; and as it was then Tide of Ebb, they seemed to me to
wait for the Return of the Flood, to go away again; it is not easy to
imagine what Confusion this Sight put me into, especially seeing them
come on my Side the Island, and so near me too; but when 1
observ'd their coming mu»t be always with the Current of the Ebb, I
began afterwards to be more sedate in my Mind, being satisfy'd that I
might go abroad with Safety all the Time of the Tide of Flood, if th«j
were not on Shore before: And having made this Observation, I
-r«»nt abroad about my Harvest-Work with the more Composure
As I expected, so it proved; for as soon as the Tide made to the
Westward, I saw them all take Boat, and row (or paddle, as we caJ
it) all away: I should have observ'd that for an Hour and more before
they went off, they went to dancing, and I could easily discern their
Postures, and Gestures, by my Glasses: I could not perceive by my
nicest Observation, but that they were stark naked, and had not the
least Covering upon them; but whether they were Men or Women,
that I could not distinguish.
As soon as I saw them shipped, and gone, I took two Guns upon
Kiy Shoulders, and two Pistols at my Girdle, and my great Sword by
my Side, without a Scabbard, and with all the Speed I was able to
make, I went away to the Hill, where I had discover'd the first Ap-
pearance of all; and as soon as I gat thither, which was not less than
two hours, (for I could not go apace, being so loaded with Arms as I
was) I perceiv'd there had been three Canoes more of Savages on
that Place; and looking out farther, I saw they were all at Sea
together, and making over for the Main.
This was a dreadful Sight to me, especially when going down to the
Shore, I could see the Marks of Horror, which the dismal Work they
had been about had left behind it, viz. The Blood, the Bones, and
Part of the Flesh of human Bodies, eaten and devour'd by those
Wretches, with Merriment and Sport: I was so filled with Indigna-
tion at the Sight, that I began now to premeditate the Destruction of
the next that I saw there, let them be who or how many soever.
It seemed evident to me, that the Visits which they thus make to
this Island, are not very frequent; for it was above fifteen Months
before any more of them came on Shore there again ; that is to say, I
neither saw them, or any Footsteps, or Signals of them, in all that
Time; for as to the rainy Seasons, then they are sure not to come
abroad, at least not so far; yet all this while I lived uncomfortably,
by Reason of the constant Apprehensions I was in of their coming
upon me by Surprise; from whence I observe, that the Expectation
of Evil is more bitter than the Suffering, especially if there is no
room to shake off that Expectation, or those Apprehensions.
During all this Time, I was in the murdering Humour; and took
up most of my Hours, which should have been better employ'd, in
contriving how to circumvent, and fall upon them, the very next Time
I should see them; especially if they should be divided, as they were
the last Time, into two Parties; nor did I consider at all, that if I
killed one Party, suppose Ten, or a Dozen, I was still the next Day,
or Week, or Month, to kill another, and so another, even ad infinitum,
till I should be at length no less a Murderer than they were in being
Man-eaters; and perhaps much more so.
I spent my Days now in great Perplexity, and Anxiety of Mind,
expecting that I should one Day or other fall into the Hands of these
merciless Creatures; and if I did at any Time venture abroad, it was
not without looking round me with the greatest Care and Caution
imaginable; and now I found to my great Comfort, how happy it was
that I provided for a tame Flock or Herd of Goats; for I durst not
upon any Account fire my Gun, especially near that Side of the
Island where they usually came, lest I should alarm the Savages;
and if they had fled from me now, I was sure to have them come
back again, with perhaps two or three hundred Canoa with them, in
a few Days, and then I knew what to expect
However, I wore out a Year and three Months more, before I ever
saw any more of the Savages, and then I found them again, as I shall
soon observe. It is true, they might have been there once, or twice;
but either they made no Stay, or at lest I did not hear them; but in
the Month of May, as near as I could calculate, and in my four-an&
wentieth Year, I had a very strange Encounter with them, of which
in its Place.
The Perturbation of my Mind, during this fifteen or sixteen Months'
Interval, was very great; I slept unquiet, dreamed always frightful
Dreams, and often started out of my Sleep in the Night: In the Day
great Troubles overwhelm'd my Mind, and in the Night I dreamed
often of killing the Savages, and of the Reasons why I might justify
the doing of it; but to waive all this for a while, it was in the middle
of May, on the sixteenth Day I think, as well as my poor wooden
Calendar would reckon; for I marked all upon the Post still; I say,
it was the sixteenth of May, that it blew a very great Storm of Wind,
all Day, with a great deal of Lightning, and Thunder, and a very foul
Night it was after it; I know not what was the particular Occasion of
it; but as I was reading in the Bible, and taken up with very serious
Thoughts about my present Condition, I was surpris'd with a Noise
of a Gun, as I thought fired at Sea.
This was to be sure a Surprise of a quite different Nature from any
I had met with before; for the Notions this put into my Thoughts,
ircre quite of another kind . I started up in the greatest haste im-
aginable, and in a trice clapped my Ladder to the middle Place ol
the Rock, and pulled it after me, and mounting it the second Time,
got to the Top of the Hill, the very Moment, that a Flash of Fire bid
me listen for a second Gun, which accordingly, in about half a Minute,
I heard, and by the sound, knew that it was from that Part of the Sea
where I was driven down the Current in my Boat
I immediately consider'd that this must be some Ship in Distress
and that they had some Comrade, or some other Ship in Company,
and fired these Guns for Signals of Distress, and to obtain Help: I
had this Presence of Mind at that Minute, as to think that though I
could not help them, it may be they might help me; so I brought
together all the dry Wood I could get at hand, and making a good
handsome Pile, I set it on Fire upon the Hill; the Wood was dry,
and blazed freely; and though the Wind blew very hard, yet it burnt
fairly out; that I was certain, if there was any such Tning as a Ship,
they must needs see it, and no doubt they did; for as soon as ever
my Fire blazed up, I heard another Gun, and after that several others,
all from the same Quarter. I plied my Fire all Night long, until Day
broke; and when it was broad Day, and the Air cleared up, I saw
something at a great Distance at Sea, full East of the Island, whether
a Sail, or a Hull, I could not distinguish, no not with my Glasses, the
Distance was so great, and the Weather still something hazy also;
at least it was so out at Sea.
I looked frequently at it all that Day, and soon perceiv'd that it
did not move; so I presently concluded, that it was a Ship at an Anchor,
and being eager, you may be sure, to be satisfied, I took my Gun in
my Hand, and run toward the South Side of the Island, to the Rocks
where I had formerly been carried away with the Current, and getting
up there, the Weather by this Time being perfectly clear, I could
plainly see to my great Sorrow, the Wreck of a Ship cast away in the
. Night, upon those concealed Rocks which I found, when I was out
in my Boat; and which Rocks, as they checked the Violence of the
Stream, and made a kind of Counter-stream, or Eddy, were the
Occasion of my recovering from the most desperate hopeless Condi-
tion that ever I had been in in all my Life.
Thus what is one Man's Safety, is another Man's Destruction; for
it seems these Men, whoever they were, being out of their Knowledge,
and the Rocks being wholly under Water, had been driven upon them
in the Night, the Wind blowing hard at E. and E.N.E.! Had they
seen the Island, as I must necessarily suppose thej did not, they
must, as I thought, have endeavour^ to have saved themselves on
Shore by the Help of their Boat; but their firing of Guns for Help,
especially when they saw, as I imagin'd, my Fire, filled me with many
Thoughts; First, I imagin'd that upon seeing my Light, they might
have put themselves into their Boat, and have endeavour'd to make
the Shore; but that the Sea going very high, they might have been
cast away; other Times I imagin'd, that they might have lost their
Boat before, as might be the Case many Ways; as particularly by
the Breaking of the Sea upon their Ship, which many Times obliges
Men to stave, or take in Pieces their Boat; and sometimes to throw
it overboard with their own Hands: Other Times I imagin'd, they
had some other Ship, or Ships in Company, who upon the Signals of
Distress they had made, had taken them up, and carried them off:
Other whiles I fancied, they were all gone off to Sea in their Boat,
and being hurried away by the Current that I had been formerly in,
were carried out into the great Ocean, where there was nothing but
Misery and Perishing; and that perhaps they might by this Time
think of Starving, and of being in a Condition to eat one another.
As all these were but Conjectures at best; so in the Condition I was
in, I could do no more than look on upon the Misery of the poor
Men, and pity them, which had still this good Effect on my Side, that
it gave me more and more Cause to give Thanks to God who had so
happily and comfortably provided for me in my desolate Condition;
and that of two Ships' Companies who were now cast away upon this
part of the World, not one Life should be spared but mine: I learned
here again to observe, that it is very rare that the Providence of God
casts us into any Condition of Life so low, or any Misery so great,
but we may see something or other to be thankful for; and may see
others in worse Circumstances than our own.
Such ceitainly was the Case of these Men, of whom I could not so
much as see room to suppose any of them were saved; nothing
could make it rational, so much as to wish, or expect that they did not
all perish there; except the Possibility only of their being taken up by
another Ship in Company, and this was but mere Possibility indeed;
for I saw not the least Signal or Appearance of any such Thing.
I cannot explain by any possible Energy of Words, what a strange
longing or hankering of Desires I felt in my Soul upon this Sight;
breaking out sometimes thus; O that there had been but one or two;
nay, or but one Soul saved out of this Ship, to have escap'd to me,
that I might but have had one Companion, one Fellow Creature to
have spoken to me, and to have convers'd with! In all the Time of
my solitary Life, I never felt so earnest, so strong a Desire after the
Society of my Fellow Creatures, or so deep a Regret at the want of
it
There are some secret moving Springs in the Affections, which
when they are set a going by some Object in view, or be it some
Object, though not in view, yet rendered present to the Mind by the
Power of Imagination, that Motion carries out the Soul by its Impe-
tuosity to such violent eager Embracings of the Object, that the Absence
of it is insupportable.
Such were these earnest Wishings, That but one Man had been
saved! O that it had been but One / I believe I repeated the Words
O that it had been but One IA thousand Times; and the Desires were
so moved by it, that when I spoke the Words, my Hands would
clinch together, and my Fingers press the Palms of my Hands, that
if I had had any soft Thing in my Hand, it would have crushed it
involuntarily; and my Teeth in my Head would strike together, and
set against one another so strong, that for some Time I could not
port them again.
Let the Naturalists explain these Things, and the Reason and
Manner of them; all I can say to them is, to describe the Fact, which
was even surprising to me when I found it; though I knew not from
what it should proceed; it was doubtless the effect of ardent Wishes,
and of strong Ideas formed in my Mind, realizing the Comfort, which
the Conversation of one of my Fellow-Christians would have been
to me.
But it was not to be; either their Fate, or mine, or both, forbid it;
lor till the last Year of my being on this Island, I never knew whether
any were saved out of that Ship or no; and had only the Affliction
some Days after, to see the Corpse of a drowned Boy come on Shore,
at the End of the Island which was next the Shipwreck: He had on
no Clothes, but a Seaman's Waistcoat, a Pair of open knee'd Linen
Drawers, and a blue Linen Shirt; but nothing to direct me so much
as to guess what Nation he was of: He had nothing in his Pocket,
but two Pieces of Eight, and a Tobacco Pipe; the last was to me of
ten times more value than the first
It was now calm, and I had a great mind to venture out in my
o
Boat, to this Wreck; not doubting but I might find something on
board, that might be useful to me; but that did not altogether press
me so much, as the Possibility that there might be yet some living
Creature on board, whose Life I might not only save, but might by
saving that Life, comfort my own to the last Degree; and this Thought
clung so to my Heart, that I could not be quiet, Night or Day, but
I must venture out in my Boat on board this Wreck; and committing
the rest to God's Providence, I thought the Impression was so strong
upon my Mind, that it could not be resisted, that it must come from
some invisible Direction, and that I should be wanting to myself if I
did not go.
Under the Power of this Impression, I hasten'd back to my Castle,
prepar'd everything for my Voyage, took a Quantity of Bread, a great
Pot for fresh Water, a Compass to steer by, a Bottle of Rum; for I
had still a great deal of that left; a Basket full of Raisins: And thus
loading myself with everything necessary, I wen/; down to my Boat,
got the Water out of her, and got her afloat, loaded all my Cargo in
her, and then went Home again for more; my second Cargo was a
great Bag full of Rice, the Umbrella to set up over my Head for
Shade, another large Pot full of fresh Water, and about two Dozen of
my small Loaves, or Barley Cakes, more than before, with a Bottle of
Goat's Milk, and a Cheese; all which, with great Labour and Sweat,
I brought to my Boat; and praying to God to direct my Voyage, I
put out, and Rowing or Paddling the Canoe along the Shore, I came
at last to the utmost Point of the Island on that Side (viz.) N.E.
And now I was to launch out into the Ocean, and either to venture,
or not to venture. I looked on the rapid Currents which ran con-
stantly on both Sides of the Island, at a Distance, and which were
very terrible to me, from the Remembrance of the Hazard I had been
in before, and my Heart began to fail me; for I foresaw that if I was
driven in to either of those Currents, I should be carried a vast Way
out to Sea, and perhaps out of my Reach, or Sight of the Island
again; and that then, as my Boat was but small, if any little Gale of
Wind should rise, I should be inevitably lost
These Thoughts so oppress'd my Mind, that I began to give over
my Enterprise, and having hauled my Boat into a little Creek on the
Shore, I stepped out, and sat me down upon a little rising hit of
Ground, very pensive and anxious, between Fear and Desire about
my Voyage; when as I was musing, I could perceive that the Tide
was turned, and the Flood come on, upon which my going was for so
many Hours impracticable; upon this presently it occurr'd to me,
that I should go up to the highest Piece of Ground I could find, and
observe, if I could, how the Sets of the Tide, or Currents lay, wheu
the Hood came in, that I might judge whether if I was driven one
way out, I might not expect to be driven another way home, with
the same Rapidness of the Currents : This Thought was no sooner in
my Head, but I cast my eye upon a little Hill, which sufficiently
overlook'd the Sea both ways, and from whence I had a clear view,
of the Currents, or Sets of the Tide, and which way I was to guide
myself in my Return; here I found, that as the Current of the Ebb
set out close by the South Point of the Island; so the Current of the

flood set m close by the Shore of the North Side, and that I had
nothing to do but to keep to the North of the Island in my Return,
and I should do well enough.
Encourag'd with this Observation, I resolv'd the next Morning to
set out with the first of the Tide; and reposing myself for the Night
in the Canoe, under ihe great Watch-coat, I mention'd, I launched
out: I made first a little out to Sea full North, till I began to feel the
Benefit of the Current, which set Eastward, and which carried me at
a great rate, and yet did not so hurry me as the Southern Side
Current had done before, and so as to take from me all Government
of the Boat: but having a strong Steerage with my Paddle, I went at
a great rate, directly for the Wreck, and in less than two Hours I
came up to it
It was a dismal Sight to look at: The Ship, which by its building
was Spanish, stuck fast, jammed in between two Rocks ; all the Stern
and Quarter of her was beaten to pieces, with the Sea; and as her
Forecastle, which stuck in the Rocks, had run on with great Violence,
her Mainmast and Foremast were brought by the Board; that is to
say, broken short off; but her Bowsprit was sound, and the Head
and Bow appear'd firm; when I came close to her, a Dog appear'd
upon her, who seeing me coming, yelped and cried; and as soon as
I called him, jumped into the Sea, to come to me, and I took him
into the Boat; but found him almost dead for Hunger and Thirst: I
gave him a Cake of my Bread, and he eat it like a ravenous Wolf,
that had been starving a Fortnight in the Snow: I then gave the poor
Creature some fresh Water, with which, if I would have let him, he
would have burst himself.
After this I went on board; but the first Sight I met with, was two
Men drowncd, in the Cook-room, or Forecastle of the Ship, with their
Arms fast about one another: I concluded, as is indeed probable,
that when the Ship struck, it being in a Storm, the Sea broke so high,
and so continually over her, that the Men were not able to bear it,
and were strangled with the constant rushing in of the Water, as much
as it they had been under Water. Besides the Dog, there was nothing
/eft in the Ship that had Life; nor any Goods that I could see, but
what were spoiled by the Water. There were some Casks of Liquor,
whether Wine or Brandy, I knew not, which lay lower in the Hold;
and which, the Water being ebbed out, I could see; but they were
too big to meddle with: I saw several Chests, which I believ'd be-
long'd to some of the Seamen; and I got two of them into the Boat
without examining what was in them.
Had the Stern of the Ship been fixed, and the Forepart broken off,
I am persuaded I might have made a good Voyage; for by what I
found in these two Chests, I had room to suppose, the Ship had a
gieat deal of Wealth on board; and if I may guess by the Course she
steered, she must have been bound from the Buenos Ayres, or the
Rio de la Plata, in the South Part of America, beyond the Brasils, to
the Havana, in the Gulf of Mexico, and so perhaps to Spain: She
had, no doubt, a great Treasure in her; but of no use at that time
to anybody; and what became of the rest of her People, I then
knew not
I found besides these Chests, a little Cask full of Liquor, of about
twenty Gallons, which I got into my Boat, with much Difficulty;
there were several Muskets in a Cabin, and a great Powder-horn, with
about 4 Pounds of Powder in it; as for the Muskets, I had no occasion
for them; so I left them, but took the Powder-horn: I took a Fire
Shovel and Tongs, which I wanted extremely; as also two little Brass
Kettles, a Copper Pot to make Chocolate, and a Gridiron; and with
this Cargo, and the Dog, I came away, the Tide beginning to make
home again; and the same Evening, about an Hour within Night, I
reached the Island again, weary and fatigu'd to the last Degree.
I repos'd that Night in the Boat, and in the Morning I resolved to
karbour what I had gotten in my new Cave, not to carry it home to
my Castle. After refreshing myself, I got all my Cargo on Shore,
and began to examine the Particulars: The Cask of Liquor I found
to be a kind of Rum, but not such as we had at the Brasils; and in
a Word, not at all good; but when I came to open the Chests, I
found several Things, of great use to me: For Example, I found in
one, a fine Case of Bottles, of an extraordinary kind, and filled with
Cordial Waters, fine, and very good; the Bottles held about three
pints each, and were tipped with Silver: I found two Pots of very
good Succades, or Sweetmeats, so fastened also on top, that the Salt
Water had not hurt them; and two more of the same, which the
IVater had spoiled: I found some very good Shirts, which were very
welcome to me; and about a dozen and half of Linen white Handker-
chiefs, and colour'd Neckcloths; the former were also very welcome,
being exceeding refreshing to wipe my Face in a hot Day; besides
this, when I came to the Till in the Chest, I found there three great
Bags of Pieces of Eight, which held about eleven hundred Pieces in
all; and in one of them, wrapt up in a Paper, six Doubloons of Gold,
and some small Bars or Wedges of Gold; I suppose they might all
weigh near a Pound.
The other Chest I found had some Clothes in it, but of little Value;
but by the Circumstances it must have belong'd to the Gunner's Mate;
though there was no Powder in it; but about two Pound of fine glazed
Powder, in three small Flasks, kept, I suppose, for charging their
Fowling Pieces on occasion: Upon the whole, I got very little by
this Voyage, that was of any use to me; for as to the Money, I had
no manner of occasion for it: It was to me as the Dirt under mj
Feet; and I would have given it all for three or four pair of English
Shoes and Stockings, which were Things I greatly wanted, but r.ad
not had on my Feet now for many Years: I had indeed gotten
two pair of Shoes now, which I took off of the Feet of the two
drowned Men, who I saw in the Wreck; and I found two pair more
in one of the Chests, which were very welcome to me; but they were
not like our English Shoes, either for Ease, or Service; being rather
what we call Pumps, than Shoes: I found in this Seaman's Chest
about fifty Pieces of Eight in Royals, but no Gold; I suppose this
belong'd to a poorer Man than the other, which seemed to belong to
some Officer.
Well, however, I lugged this Money home to my Cave, and laid it
up, as I had done that before, which I brought from our own Ship;
but it was great Pity as I said, that the other Part of this Ship had
not come to my Share; for I am satisfy'd I might have loaded my
Canoe several Times over with Money, which if I had ever escap'd
to England, would have lain here safe enough, till I might have come
again and fetched it
Having now brought all my Things on Shore, and secur'd them, I
went back to my Boat, and rowed, or paddled her along the Shore, to
her old Harbour, where I laid her up, and made the best of my way
to my old Habitation, where I found everything safe and quiet; so
I began to repose myself, live after my old fashion, and lake care of
my Family Affairs; and for a while, I lived easy enough; only that I
was more vigilant than I used to be, looked out oftener, and did not
go abroad so much; and if at any time I did stir with any Freedom,
it was always to the East Part of the Island, where I was pretty well
satisfy'd the Savages never came, and where I could go without so
many Precautions, and such a Load of Arms and Ammunition, as I
always carried with me, if I went the other way.
I lived in this Condition near two Years more; but my unlucky
Head, that was always to let me know it was born to make my Body
miserable, was all this two Years filled with Projects and Designs,
how, if it were possible, I might get away from this Island; for some-
times I was for making another Voyage to the Wreck, though my
Reason told me that there was nothing left there, worth the Hazard
of my Voyage: Sometimes for a Ramble one way, sometimes another;
and I believe verily, if I had had the Boat that I went from Sallee in,
I should have ventur'd to Sea, bound anywhere, I knew not whither.
I had been in all my Circumstances a Memento to those who are
touched with the general Plague of Mankind, whence, for ought I
know, one half of their Miseries flow; I mean, that of not being
satisfy'd with the Station wherein God and Nature has placed them;
for not to look back upon my primitive Condition, and the excellent
Advice of my Father, the Opposition to which, was, as I may call it,
my Original Sin; my subsequent Mistakes of the same kind had
been the Means of my coming into this miserable Condition; for had
that Providence, which so happily had seated me at the Brasils, as a
Planter, blessed me with confin'd Desires, and I could have been
contented to have gone on gradually, I might have been by this
Time, / mean, in the Time of my being in this Island, one of the
most considerable Planters in the Brasils; nay, I am persuaded, that
by the Improvements I had made, in that little Time I lived there, and
the Increase I should probably have made, if I had stayed, I might
have been worth an hundred thousand Moidores; and what Business
had I to leave a settled Fortune, a well-stocked Plantation, improving
and increasing, to turn Super-Cargo to Guinea, to fetch Negroes;
when Patience and Time would have so increas'd our Stock at Home,
that we could have bought them at our own Door, from those whose
Business it was to fetch them; and though it had cost us something
more, yet the Difference of that Price was by no Means worth saving,
at so great a Hazard.
But as this is ordinarily the Fate of young Heads, so Reflection
upon the Folly of it, is as ordinarily the Exercise of more Years, or of
the dear-bought Experience of Time; and so it was with me now;
and yet so deep had the Mistake taken root in my Temper, that I
could not satisfy myself in my Station, but was continually poring
upon the Means, and Possibility of my Escape from this Place; and
that I may with the greater Pleasure to the Reader, bring on the
remaining Part of my Story, it may not be improper, to give some
Account of my first Conceptions on the Subject of this foolish Scheme,
for my Escape; and how, and upon what Foundation I acted.
I am now to be suppos'd retir'd into my Castle, after my late
Voyage to the Wreck, my Frigate laid up, and secur'd under Water,
as usual, and my Condition restor'd to what it was before: I had
more Wealth indeed than I had before, but was not at all the richer;
for I had no more use for it, than the Indians of Peru had, before the
Spaniards tame there.
It was flue of the Nights in the rainy Season in March, the four-and-
twentieth Vear of my first setting Foot in this Island of Solitariness;
I was lying in my Bed, or Hammock, awake, very well in Health,
had no Pain, no Distemper, no Uneasiness of Body; no, nor any
Uneasiness of Mind, more than ordinary; but could by no means
close my Eyes; that is, so as to sleep; no, not a Wink all Night
long, otherwise that as follows:
It is as impossible, as needless, to set down the innumerable Crowd
of Thoughts that whirled through that great throughfare of the Brain,
the Memory, in this Night's Time: I ran over the whole History of
my Life in Miniature, or by Abridgment, as I may call it, to my
coming to this Island; and also of the Part of my Life, since I came
to this Island. In my Reflections upon the State of my Case, since
I came on Shore on this Island, I was comparing the happy Posture
of my Affairs, in the first Years of my Habitation here, compar'd to
the Life of Anxiety, Fear and Care, which I had lived ever since I
had seen the Print of a Foot in the Sand; not that I did not believe
the Savages had frequented the Island even all the while, and might
have been several Hundreds of them at Times on Shore there; but
I had never known it, and was incapable of any Apprehensions about
it; my Satisfaction was perfect, though my Danger was the same;
and I was as happy in not knowing my Danger, as if I had never
really been expos'd to it: This furnish'd my Thoughts with many
very profitable Reflections, and particularly this one, How infinitely
Good that Providence is, which has provided in its Government of
Mankind, such narrow bounds to his Sight and Knowledge of Things,
and though he walks in the midst of so many thousand Dangers, the
Sight of which, if discover'd to him, would distract his Mind, and
sink his Spirits; he is kept serene, and calm, by having the Events of
Things hid from his Eyes, and knowing nothing of the Dangers which
surround him.
After these Thoughts had for some Time entertain'd me, I came ti
reflect seriously upon the real Danger I had been in, for so many
Years, in this very Island; and how I had walked about in the
greatest Security, and with all possible Tranquillity; even when
perhaps nothing but a Brow of a Hill, a great Tree, or the Casual
Approach of Night, had been between me and the worst kind of
Destruction, viz. That of falling into the Hands of Cannibals, and
Savages, who would have seized on me with the same View, as I did
of a Goat, or a Turtle; and have thought it no more a Crime to kill
and devour me, than I did of a Pigeon, or Curlew: I would unjustly
dander myself, if I should say I was notsincerely thankful to my great
Preserver, to whose singular Protection I acknowledg'd, with great
Humility, that all these unknown Deliverances were due; and with-
out which, I must inevitably have fallen into their merciless Hands.
When these Thoughts were over, my Head was for some time taken
np in considering the Nature of these wretched Creatures; I mean,
the Savages; and how it came to pass in the World, that the wise
Governor of all Things should give up any of his Creatures to such
Inhumanity; nay, to something so much below, even Brutality itself
as to devour its own kind; but as this ended in some (at that Time
fruitless) Speculations, it occurr'd to me to inquire, what Part of the
World these Wretches lived in; how tar off the Coast was from whence
they came; what they ventur'd over so far from home for; what
kind of Boats they had; and why I might not order myself, and my
Business so, that I might be as able to go over thither, as they were
to come to me.
I never so much as troubled myself, to consider what I should do
with myself, when I came thither; what would become of me, if I fell
into the Hands of the Savages; or how I should escape from them,
if they attempted me; no, nor so much as how it was possible for me
to reach the Coast, and not be attempted by some or other of them,
without any Possibility of delivering myself; and if I should not fall
into their Hands, what I should do for Provision, or whither I should
bend my Course; none of these Thoughts, I say, so much as came
in my way; but my Mind was wholly bent upon the Notion of my
passing over in my Boat, to the Main Land: I looked back upon my
present Condition, as the most miserable that could possibly be, that
I was not able to throw myself into anything but Death, that could be
called worse; that if I reached the Shore of the Main, I might perhaps
meet with Relief, or I might coast along, as I did on the Shore of
Africa, till I came to some inhabited Country, and where I might
find some Relief; and after all perhaps, I might fall in with some
Christian Ship, that might take me in; and if the worse came to the
worst, I could but die, which would put an end to all these Miseries
at once. Pray note, all this was the fruit of a disturb'd Mind, an
impatient Temper, made as it were desperate by the long Continuance
of my Troubles, and the Disappointments I had met in the Wreck, I had
been on board of; and where I had been so near the obtaining what I
so earnestly longed for, viz. Somebody to spea> to, and to learn some
Knowledge from of the Place where I was, and of the probable Means
of my Deliverance; I say, I was agitated wholly by these Thoughts:
All my Calm of Mind in my Resignation to Providence, and waiting
the Issue of the Dispositions of Heaven, seemed to be suspended;
and I had, as it were, no Power to turn my Thoughts to anything,
but to the Project of a Voyage to the Main, which came upon me
with such Force, and such an Impetuosity of Desire, that it was not
to be resisted
When this had agitated my Thoughts for two Hours, or more, with
such Violence, that it set my very Blood into a Ferment, and my
Pulse beat as high as if I had been in a Fever, merely with the ex-
traordinary Fervour of my Mind about it; Nature, as if I had been
fatigued and exhausted with the very Thought of it, threw me into a
sound Sleep; one would have thought, I should have dreamed of it:
But I did not, nor of anything relating to it; but I dreamed, that as
I was going out in the Morning as usual from my Castle, I saw upon
the Shore, two Canoes, and eleven Savages coming to Land, and that
they brought with them another Savage, who they were going to kill,
in Order to eat him; when on a sudden, the Savage, that they were
going to kill, jumped away, and ran for his Life; and I thought in my
Sleep, that he came running into my little thick Grove, before my
Fortification, to hide himself; and that I seeing him alone, and not
perceiving that the other sought him that Way, showed myself to him,
and smiling upon him, encourag'd him; that he kneeled down to me,
seeming to pray me to assist him; upon which I showed my Ladder,
made him go up, and carried him into my Cave, and he became my
Servant; and that as soon as I had gotten this Man, I said to myself,
now I may certainly venture to the main Land; for this Fellow will
serve me as a Pilot, and will tell me what to do, and whither to go
for Provisions; and whither not to go for fear of being devoured,
what Places to venture into, and what to escape: I waked with this
Thought, and was under such inexpressible Impressions of Joy, at the
Prospect of my Escape in my Dream, that the Disappointments which
I felt upon coming to myself, and finding it was no more than a Dream,
were equally extravagant the other Way, and threw me into a very
great Dejection of Spirit
Upon this however, I made this Conclusion, that my only Way
to go about an Attempt for an Escape, was, if possible, to get a
Savage into my Possession j and if possible, it should be one of theii
Prisoners, who they had condemn'd to be eaten, and sfcoula bring
thither to kill; but these Thoughts still were attended with this
Difficulty, that it .was impossible to effect this, without attacking a
whole Caravan of them, and killing them all; and this was not only
a very desperate Attempt, and might miscarry; but on the other Hand,
I had greatly scrupled the Lawfulness of it to me; and my Heart
trembled at the thoughts of shedding so much Blood, though it was
for my Deliverance. I need not repeat the Arguments which occurr'd
to me against this, they being the same inention'd before; but though
I had other Reasons to offer now, (viz.) that those Men were Enemiei
to my Life, and would devour me, if they could; that it was Self
preservation in the highest Degree, to deliver myself from this Death
of a Life, and was acting in my own Defence, as much as if they
were actually assaulting me, and the like. I say, though these Things
argued for it, yet the Thoughts of shedding Human Blood for my
Deliverance, were very Terrible to me, and such as I could by no
Means reconcile myself to, a great while.
However at last, after many secret Disputes with myself, and after
great Perplexities about it, for all these Arguments one Way and
another struggl'd in my Head a long Time, the eager prevailing
Desire of Deliverance at length master'd all the rest; and I resolv'd,
if possible, to get one of those Savages into my Hands, cost what it
would. My next Thing then was to contrive how to do it, and this
indeed was very difficult to resolve on: But as I could pitch upon no
probable Means for it, so I resolv'd to put myself upon the Watch,
to see them when they came on Shore, and leave the rest to the
Event, taking such Measures as the Opportunity should present, let
be what would be.
With these Resolutions in my Thoughts, I set myself upon the
Scout, as often as possible, and indeed so often till I was heartily
tired of it; for it was above a Year and Half that I waited, and for
great part of that Time went out to the West End, and to the South
West Corner of the Island, almost every Day, to see for Canoes, but
none appear'd. This was very discouraging, and began to trouble
me much, though I cannot say that it did in this Case, as it had
done some time before that, (viz.) wear off the Edge of my Desire to
the Thing. But the longer it seemed to be delay'd, the more eager
I was for it; in a Word, I was not at first so careful to shun the
sight of these Savages, and avoid being seen by them, as I was now
eager to be upon them.
Besides, I fancied myself able to manage One, nay, Two or Three
Savages, if I had them so as to make them entirely Slaves to me,
to do whatever I should direct them, and to prevent their being able
at any time to do me any Hurt It was a great whil^ that I pleased
myself with this Affair, but nothing still presented; all my Fancies
and Schemes came to nothing, for no Savages came near me for a
great while.
About a Year and half after I had entertain'd these Notions, and
by long musing, had as it were resolved them all into nothing, for
want of an Occasion to put them in Execution, I was surpris'd one
Morning early, with seeing no less than five Canoes all on Shore to-
gether on my side the Island; and the People who belong'd to them
all landed, and out of my sight: The Number of them broke all my
Measures, for seeing so many, and knowing that they always came
four or six, or sometimes more in a Boat, I could not tell what to
think of it, or how to take my Measures, to attack Twenty or Thirty
Men single-handed; so I lay still in my Castle, perplex'd and dis-
comforted: However I put myself into all the same Postures for an
Attack that I had formerly provided, and was just ready for Action,
if anything had presented. Having waited a good while, listening to
hear if they made any Noise; at length, being very impatient, I set
my Guns at the Foot of my Ladder, and clamber'd up to the Top of
the Hill, by my two Stages as usual; standing so however that my
Head did not appear above the Hill, so that they could not perceive
me by any Means; here I observ'd, by the help of my Perspective
Glass, that they were no less than Thirty in Number, that they had a
Fire kindled, that they had had Meat dressed. How they had cooked
it, that I knew not, or what it was; but they were all Dancing in I
know not how many barbarous Gestures and Figures, their own Way,
round the Fire.
While I was thus looking on them, I perceived by my Perspective,
two miserable Wretches dragged from their Boats, where it seems
they were laid by, and were now brought out for the Slaughter. I
perceived one of them immediately fell, being knocked down, I
suppose with a Club or Wooden Sword, for that was their way, and
two or three others were at work immediately cutting him open for their
Cookarv, while the other Victim was left standing bv himself, rill thev
should be ready for him. In that very Moment this poor Wretch
seeing himself a little at Liberty, Nature inspir'd him with Hopes of
Life, and he started away from them, and ran with incredible Swiftness
along the Sands directly towards me, I mean towards that part of the
Coast, where my Habitation was.
I was dreadfully frighted, (that I must acknowledge) when I per-
ceived him to run my Way; and especially, when as I thought I saw
him pursued by the whole Body, and now I expected that part of
my Dream was coming to pass, and that he would certainly take
shelter in my Grove; but I could not depend by any means upon
my Dream for the rest of it, (viz.) that the other Savages would not
pursue him thither, and find him there. However I kept my Station,
and my Spirits began to recover, when I found that there was not
above three Men that follow'd him, and still more was I encourag'd,
when I found that he outstripp'd them exceedingly in running, and
gained Ground of them, so that if he could but hold it for half an
Hour, I saw easily he would fairly get away from them all.
There was between them and my Castle, the Creek which I men-
tion'd often at the first part of my Story, when I landed my Cargoes
out of the Ship; and this I saw plainly, he must necessarily swim
over, or the poor Wretch would be taken there : But when the Savage
escaping came thither, he made nothing of it, though the Tide was
then up, but plunging in, swam through in about Thirty Strokes or
thereabouts, landed and ran on with exceeding Strength and Swift-
ness; when the Three Persons came to the Creek, I found that Two
of them could Swim, but the Third could not, and that standing on
the other Side, he looked at the other, but went no further; and soon
after went softly back again, which as it happen'd, was very well for
him in the main.
I observ'd, that the two who swam, were yet more than twice as
long swimming over the Creek, as the Fellow was, that fled from
them: It came very warmly upon my Thoughts, and indeed irre-
sistibly, that now was my Time to get me a Servant, and perhaps a
Companion, or Assistant; and that I was called plainly by Provi-
dence to save this poor Creature's Life; I immediately run down the
Ladders with all possible Expedition, fetches my two Guns, for they
were both but at the Foot of the Ladders, as I observ'd above ; and get-
ting up again, with the same haste, to the Top of the Hill, I crossed
toward the Sea; and having a very short Cut, and all down Hill,
i8o
ADVENTURES OF
clapped myself in the way, between the Pursuers, and the Pursu'd,
hallowing aloud to him that fled, who looking back, was at first per-
haps as much frighted at me, as at them; but I beckon'd with my
Hand to him, to come back ; and in the meantime, I slowly advanc'd
towards the two that follow'd; then rushing at once upon the fore-
most, I knocked him down with the Stock of my Piece; I was loth
to fire, because I would not have the rest hear; though at that dis-
tance, it would not have been easily heard, and being out of Sight of
the Smoke too, they would not have easily known what to make of
it: Having knocked this Fellow down, the other who pursu'd with
him stopped, as if he had been frighted; and I advanc'd apace
towards him; but as I came nearer, I perceiv'd presently, he had a
Bow and Arrow, and was fitting it to shoot at me; so I was then
necessitated to shoot at him first, which I did, and killed him ai the

first Shot; the poor Savage who fled, but had stopped, though he saw
both his Enemies fallen, and killed as he thought; yet was so frighted
with the Fire, and Noise of my Piece, that he stood Stock still, and
neither came forward or went backward, though he seemed rather in-
clin'd to fly still, than to come on; I hallow'd again to him, and
made Signs to come forward, which he easily understood, and came
a little way, then stopped again, and then a little further, and stopped
again, and I could then perceive that he stood trembling, as if he
had been taken Prisoner, and had just been to be killed, as his two
Enemies were; I beckon'd him again to come to me, and gave him
all the Signs of Encouragement that I could think of, and he came
nearer and nearer, kneeling down every Ten or Twelve steps in token
of acknowledgment for my saving his Life: I smiled at him, and
looked pleasantly, and beckon'd him to come still nearer; at length
he came close to me, and then he kneeled down again, kissed the
Ground, and laid his Head upon the Ground, and taking me by the
Foot, set my Foot upon his Head; this it seems was in token of
iwearing to be my Slave for ever; I took him up, and made much
of him, and encourag'd him all I could. But there was more work
to do yet, for I perceived the Savage whom I knocked down, was
not killed, but stunned with the blow, and began to come to himself;
so I pointed to him, and showing him the Savage, that he was not
dead; upon this he spoke some Words to me, and though I could
not understand them, yet I thought they were pleasant to hear, for
they were the first sound of a Man's Voice that I had heard, my own
excepted, for above Twenty-five Years. But there was no time for
such Reflections now, the Savage who was knocked down recover'd
himself so far, as to sit up upon the Ground, and I perceived that my
Savage began to be afraid; but when I saw that, I presented my
other Piece at the Man, as if I would shoot him, upon this my
Savage;-/fcr so I called him now, made a Motion to me to lend him my
Sword, which hung naked in a Belt by my side; so I did; he no
sooner had it, but he runs to his Enemy, and at one blow cut off
his Head as cleverly, no Executioner in Germany, could have done
it sooner or better; which I thought very strange, for one who I had
Reason to believe never saw a Sword in his Life before, except their
own Wooden Swords; however it seems, as I learned afterwards, they
make their Wooden Swords so sharp, so heavy, and the Wood is so
hard, that they will cut off Heads even with them, aye and Arms,
and that at one blow too; when he had done this, he comes laugh-
ing to me in Sign of Triumph, and brought me the Sword again, and
with abundance of Gestures which I did not understand, laid it down
with the Head of the Savage, that he had killed just before me.
But that which astonish'd him most, was to know how I had
killed the other Indian so far off, so pointing to him, he made Signs
to me to let him go to him, so I bade him go, as well as I could,
when he came to him, he stood like one amaz'd, looking at him,
turned him first on one side, then on the other, looked at the Wound
the Bullet had made, which it seems was just in his Breast, where it
had made a Hole, and no great Quantity of Blood had follow'd, but he
had bled inwardly, for he was quite dead: He took up his Bow and
Arrows, and came back, so I turned to go away, and beckon'd to him
to follow me, making Signs to him, that more might come aftei
them.
Upon this he signed to me, that he should bury them with Sand,
that they might not be seen by the rest if they follow'd; and so I
made Signs again to him to do so; he fell to Work, and in an instant
he had scraped a Hole in the Sand, with his Hands, big enough to
bury the first in, and then dragged him into it, and cover'd him, and
did so also by the other; I believe he had buried them both in a
Quarter of an Hour; then calling him away, I carry'd him not to my
Castle, but quite away to my Cave, on the farther Part of the Island;
to I did not let my Dream come to pass in that Part, viz. That he
came into my Grove for Shelter.
Here I gave him Bread, and a Bunch of Raisins to eat, and a
Draught of Water, which I found he was indeed in great Distress
for, by his Running; and having refresh'd him, I made Signs for him
to go lie down and sleep; pointing to a Place where I had laid a
great Parcel of Rice Straw, and a Blanket upon it, which I used to
sleep upon myself sometimes; so the poor Creature laid down, and
went to sleep.
He was a comely handsome Fellow, perfectly well made ; with straight
strong Limbs, not too large; tall and well shaped, and as I reckon,
about twenty-six Years of Age. He had a very good Countenance,
not a fierce and surly Aspect; but seemed to have something very
manly in his Face, and yet he had all the Sweetness and Softness of
an European in his Countenance too, especially when he smiled.
His Hair was long and black, not curled like Wool; his Forehead
very high, and large, and a great Vivacity and sparkling Sharpness
in his Eyes. The Colour of his Skin was not quite black, but very
tawny; and yet not of an ugly yellow nauseous tawny, as the Brasilians,
and Virginians, and other Natives of America are; but of a bright
kind of a dun olive Colour, that had in it something very agreeable;
though not very easy to describe. His Face was round, and plump;
his Nose small, not flat like the. Negroes, a very good Mouth, thin
Lips, and his fine Teeth well set, 'and white as Ivory. After he had
slumber'd, rather than slept, about half an Hour, he waked again, and
comes out of the Cave to me; for I had been milking my Goats,
which I had in the Enclosure just by: When he espy'd me, he came
running to me, laying himself down again upon the Ground, with all
the possible Signs of a humble thankful Disposition, making a many
«»J
intic Gestures to show it: At last he lays his Head flat upon the
Ground, close to my Foot, and sets my other Foot upon his Head, as he
had done before; and after this, made all the Signs to me of Sub-
jection, Servitude, and Submission imaginable, to let me know, how he
would serve me as long as he lived; I understood him in many
Things, and let him know, I was very well pleased with him; in a
little Time I began to speak to him, and teach him to speak to me;
and first, I made him know his Name should be Friday, which was
the Day I saved his Life; I called him so for the Memory of th<
Time; I likewise taught him to say Master, and then let him know.

that was to be my Name; I likewise taught him to say Yes and No,
and to know the Meaning of them; I gave him some Milk, in ar
earthen Pot, and let him see me Drink it before him, and sop m\
Bread in it; and I gave him a Cake of Bread, to do the like, which
he quickly complied with, and mad# Signs that it was very good foi
him
I kept there with him all that Night; but as soon as it was Day, I
beckon'd to him to come with me, and let him know, I would give
him some Clothes, at which he seemed very glad, for he was stark
naked: As we went by the Place where he had buried the two Menj
he pointed exactly to the Place, and showed me the Marks that he
had made to find them again, making Signs to me that we should dig
them up again, and eat them; at this I appear'd very angry, express'd
my Abhorrence of it, made as if I would vomit at the Thoughts of it,
and beckon'd with my Hand to him to come away, which he did
immediately, with great Submission. I then led him up to the Top
of the Hill, to see if his Enemies were gone; and pulling out my
Glass, I looked, and saw plainly the Place where they had been, but
no appearance of them, or of their Canoes; so that it was plain
they were gone, and had left their two Comrades behind them, with-
out any search after them.
But I was not content with this Discovery; but having now more
Courage, and consequently more Curiosity, I took my Man Friday
with me, giving him the Sword in his Hand, with the Bow and Arrows
at his Back, which I found he could use very dexterously, making him
carry one Gun for me, and I two for myself, and away we marched
to the Place, where these Creatures had been; for I had a Mind now
to get some fuller Intelligence of them: When I came to the Place,
my very Blood ran chill in my Veins, and my Heart sunk within me,
at the Horror of the Spectacle: Indeed it was a dreadful Sight, at
least it was so to me; though Friday made nothing of it: The Place
was cover'd with human. Bones, the Ground dyed with their Blood,
great Pieces of Flesh left here and there, half eaten, mangled, and
scorch'd; and in short, all the Tokens of the triumphant Feast they
had been making there, after a Victory over their Enemies: I saw
three Skulls, five Hands, ar.d the Bones of three or four Legs and
Feet, and abundance of other Parts of the Bodies; and Friday, by
his Signs, made me understand, that they brought over four Prisoners
to feast upon; that three of them were eaten up, and that he, pointing
to himself, was the fourth: That there had been a great Battle be-
tween them, and their next King, whose Subjects it seems he had
been one of; and that they had taken a great Number of Prisoners,
all which were carry'd to several Places by those that had taken
them in the Fight, in order to feast upon them, as was done here by
these Wretches upon those they brought hither.
I caused Friday to'gather all the Skulls, Bones, Flesh, and whatever
remain'd, and lay them together on a Heap, and make a great Fire
upon it, and burn them all to Ashes: I found Friday had still a
hankering Stomach after some of the Flesh, and was still a Cannibal in
his Nature; but I discover'd so much Abhorrence at the very
Thoughts of it, and at the least Appearance of it, that he durst not
discover it; for I had by some Means let him know, that I would kill
him if he ofter'd it
When we had done this, we came back to our Castle, and there I fell
to work for my Man Friday; and first of all, I gave him a pair of
Linen Drawers, which I had out of the poor Gunner's Chest I men-
tion'd, and which I found in the Wreck; and which with a little
Alteration fitted him very well; then I made him a Jerkin of Goat's-
skin, as well as my Skill would allow; and I was now grown a tolerable
good Tailor; and I gave him a Cap, which I had made of a Hare-skin,
very convenient and fashionable enough; and thus he was clothed for
the present, tolerably well; and was mighty well pleased to see him-
self almost as well clothed as his Master: It is true, he went
awkwardly in these Things at first; wearing the Drawers was very
awkward to him, and the Sleeves of the Waistcoat galled his Shoulders,
and the inside of his Arms; but a little easing them where he com-
plain'd they hurt him, and using himself to them, at length he took to
them very well.
The next Day after I came home to my Hutch with him, I began
to consider where I should lodge him; and that I might do well for
him, and yet be perfectly easy myself, I made a little Tent for him in
the vacant Place between my two Fortifications, in the inside of the
last, and in the outside of the first: and as there was a Door, or
Entrance there into my Cave, I made a formal framed Door-case, and
a Door to it of Boards, and set it up in the Passage, a little within
the Entrance; and causing the Door to open on the inside, I barred
it up in the Night, taking in my Ladders too; so that Friday could
no way come at me in the inside of my innermost Wall, without
making so much Noise in getting over, that it must needs waken me;
for my first Wall had now a complete Roof over it of long Poles,
covering all my Tent, and leaning up to the side of the Hill, which
was again laid cross with smaller Sticks instead of Laths, and then
thatched over a great Thickness, with the Puce Straw, which was
strong like Reeds; and at the Hole or Place which was left to go in
or out by the Ladder, I had placed a kind of Trap-door, which if it had
been attempted on the outside, would not have opened at all, but
would have fallen down, and made a great Noise; and as to Wea-
pons, 1 took them all in to my Side every Night.
But I needed none of all this Precaution; for never Man had a
more faithful, loving, sincere Servant, than Friday was to me ; without
Passions, Sullenness or Designs, perfectly oblig'd and engag'd; his
very Affections were tied to me, like those of a Child to a Father;
and I dare say, he would have sacrific'd his Life for the saving mine,
upon any occasion whatsoever; the many Testimonies he gave me
of this, put it out of doubt, and soon convinc'd me, that I needed to
use no Precautions, as to my Safety on his Account
This frequently gave me occasion to observe, and that with
wonder, that however it had pleased God, in his Providence, and in
the Government of the V'orks of his Hands, to take from so great a
Part of the W.orId of his Creatures, the best uses to which their
Faculties, and the Powers of their Souls are adapted ; yet that he has
bestow'd upon them the same Powers, the same Reason, the same
Affections, the same Sentiments of Kindness and Obligation, the
same Passions and Resentments of Wrongs; the same Sense of Grati-
tude, Sincerity, Fidelity, and all the Capacities of doing Good, and
receiving Good, that he has given to us; and that when he pleases to
offer to them Occasions of exerting these, they are as ready, nay,
more ready to apply them to the right Uses for which they were
bestow'd, than we are; and this made me very melancholy some-
times, in reflecting, as the several Occasions presented, how mean a
Use we make of all these, even though we have these Powers
enlighten'd by the great Lamp of Instruction, the Spirit of God, and
by the Knowledge of his Word, added to our Understanding; and
why it has pleased God to hide the like saving Knowledge from so
many Millions of Souls, who if I might judge by this poor Savage,
would make a much better use of it than we did.
From hence, I sometimes was led too far to invade the Sovereignty
of Providence, and as it were arraign the Justice of so arbitrary a
Disposition of Things, that should hide that Light from some, and
reveal it to others, and yet expect a like Duty from both: But I shut
it up, and checked my Thoughts with this Conclusion, (1st) That we
did not know by what Light and Law these should be Condemn'd;
but that as God was necessarily, and by the Nature of his Being,
infinitely Holy and Just, so it could not be; but that if these Creatures
were all sentenc'd to Absence from himself, it was on account of
iinning against that Light which, as the Scripture says, was a Law to
themselves, and by such Rules as their Consciences would acknowledge
to be just, though the Foundation was not discover'd to us: And,
(2nd.) that still as we are all the Clay in the Hand of the Potter, no
Vessel could say to him, Why hast thou formed me thus?
But to return to my New Companion; I was greatly delighted with
him, and made it my Business to teach him everything, that was proper
to make him useful, handy, and helpful; but especially to make him
speak, and understand me when I spake, and he was the aptest
Scholar that ever was, and particularly was so merry, so constantly
diligent, and so pleased, when he could but understand me, or make
me understand him, that it was very pleasant to me to tall \ to him;
and now my Life began to be so easy, that I began to say 11 myself,
that could I but have been safe from more Savages, I cared not, if I
was never to remove from the place while I lived.
After I had been two or three Days return'd to my Castle, I thought
that, in order to bring Friday off from his horrid way of feeding, and
from the Relish of a Cannibal's Stomach, I ought to let him taste other
Flesh; so I took him out with me one Morning to the Woods: I
went indeed intending to kill a Kid out of my own Flock, and bring
him home and dress it But as I was going, I saw a She Goat lying
down in the Shade, and two young Kids sitting by her, I catched
hold of Friday, hold, says I, stand still; and made Signs to him not
to stir, immediately I presented my Piece, shot and killed one of the
Kids. The poor Creature, who had at a Distance indeed seen me
kill the Savage his" Enemy, but did not know, or could imagine how
it was done, was sensibly surpris'd, trembled, and shook, and looked
so amaz'd, that I thought he would have sunk down. He did not
see the Kid I had shot at, or perceive I had killed it, but ripped up
his Waistcoat to feel if he was not wounded, and as I found, presently
thought I was resob/d to kill him; for he came and kneeled down to
me, and embracing my Knees, said a great many Things I did not
understand; but I could easily see that the meaning was to pray me
not to kill him.
I soon found a way to convince him that I would do him no harm,
and taking him up by the Hand laughed at him, and pointed to the
Kid which I had killed, beckoned to him to run and fetch it, which
he did; and while he was wondering and looking to see how the
Creature was killed, I loaded my Gun again, and by-and-by I saw a
great Fowl like a Hawk sit upon a Tree within Shot; so to let Friday
understand a little what I would do, I called him to me again, pointed
at the Fowl which was indeed a Parrot, though I thought it had been
a Hawk, I say pointing to the Parrot, and to my Gun, and to the
Ground under the Parrot, to let him see I would make it fall, I made
him understand that I would shoot and kill that Bird; accordingly I
fired and bade him look, and immediately he saw the Parrot fall,
he stood like one frighted again, notwithstanding all I had said to
him; and I found he was the more amaz'd, because he did not see
me put anything into the Gun; but thought that there must be some
wonderful Fund of Death and Destruction in that Thing, able to kill
Man, Beast, Bird, or anything, near or far off; and the Astonishment
this created in him was such, as could not wear off for a long Time;
and I believe, if I would have let him, he would have worshipp'd me
and my Gun: As for the Gun itself, he would not so much as touch
it for several Days after; but would speak to it, and talk to it, as if it
had-ans_wer'd him, when he was by himself; which, as I afterwards
learned of him, was to desire it not to kill him.
Well, after his Astonishment was a little over at this, I pointed to
him to run and fetch the Bird I had shot, which he did, but stayed some
Time; for the Parrot not being quite dead, was flutter'd away a good
way Off from the Place where she fell; however, he found her, took
her up, and brought her to me; and as I had perceiv'd his Ignorance
about the Gun before, I took this Advantage to charge the Gun again,
and not let him see me do it, that I might be ready for any other
Mark that might present; but nothing more offer'd at that Time;
so I brought home the Kid, and the same Evening I took the Skin
off, and cut it out as well as I could; and having a Pot for that
purpose, I boiled or stewed some of the Flesh, and made some very
good Broth; and after I had begun to eat some, I gave some to my
Man, who seemed very glad of it, and liked it very well; but that
which was strangest to him, was, to see me eat Salt with it; he made
a Sign to me, that the Salt was not good to eat, and putting a little
into his own Mouth, he seemed to nauseate it, and would spit and
sputter at it, washing his Mouth with fresh Water after it; on the
other hand, I took some Meat in my Mouth without Salt, and I pre-
tended to spit and sputter for want of Salt, as fast as he had done at
tiie Salt; but it would not do, he would never care for Salt with his
Meat, or in his Broth; at least not a great while, and then but a very
little.
Having thus fed him with boiled Meat and Broth, I was resob/d
189
to feast him the next Day with roasting a Piece of the Kid; this I did
by hanging It before the Fire, in a String, as I had seen many People
do in England, setting two Poles up, one on each side the Fire,
and one cross on the Top, and tying the String to the Cross-stick,
letting the Meat tiUTi continually: This Friday admir'd very much;
but when he came to taste the Flesh, he took so many ways to tell
me how well he liked
it, that I could not but
understand him; and
at last he told me he
would never eat Man's
Flesh any more, which
I was very glad to hear.
The next Day I set
him to work to beating
some Cor n out, and
sifting it in the manner
I used to do, as I ob-
serv'd before, and he
soon understood how
to do it as well as I,
especially after he had
seen what the Meaning
of it was, and that it
was to make Bread of;
for after that I let him
see me make my Bread,
and bake it too, and in
a little Time Friday
was able to do all the
Work for me, as well
<ts 1 could do it myself.
I began now to consider, that having two Mouths to feed, instead
of one, I must provide more Ground for my Harvest, and plant a
larger Quantity of Corn, than I used to do; so I marked out a larger
Piece of Land, and began the Fence in the same Manner as before,
in which Friday not only worked very willingly and very hard; but
did it very cheerfully, and I told him what it was for; that it was for
Com to make more Bread, because he was now with me, and that I

ADVENTURES OF
might have enough for him, and myself too: He appear'd very sensible
of that Part, and let me know, that he thought I had much more
Labour upon me on his Account, than I had for myself; and that he
would work the harder for me, if I would tell him what to do.
This was the pleasantest Year of all the Life I led in this Place;
Friday began to talk pretty well, and understand the Names of almost
everything I had occasion to call for, and of every Place I had to
send him to, and talked a great deal to me; so that in short I began
now to have some Use for my Tongue again, which indeed I had
very little occasion for before; that is to say, about Speech; besides
the Pleasure of talking to him, I had a singular Satisfaction in the
Fellow himself; his simple unfeign'd Honesty appear'd to me more
and more every Day, and I began really to love the Creature; and
on his Side, I believe he loved me more than it was possible for him
ever to love anything before.
I had a Mind once
to try if he had any
hankering Inclina-
tion to his own
Country again, and
having learned him
English so well that
he could answer me
almost any Ques-
tions, I asked him
whether the Nation
that he belong'd to
never conquer'd in
Battle, at which he
smiled; and said,
yes, yes, we always
fight the better; that
is, he meant always get the better in Fight; and so we began the
following Discourse: You always fight the better, said I, How came
you to be taken Prisoner then, Friday?
Friday, My Nation beat much, for all that
Master, How beat; if your Nation beat them, how come you to be
taken?
Friday, They more many than my Nation in the Place where mo

tuauSEEBSHHu
iras; they take one, two, three, and me; my Nation over beat them
in the yonder Place, where me no was; there my Nation take one,
two, great Thousand.
Master, But why did not your Side recover you from the Hands of
your Enemies then?
Friday, They run one, two, three, and me, and make go in the
Canoe; my Nation have no Canoe that time.
Master, Well, Friday, and What does your Nation do with the Men
they take, do they carry them away, and eat them, as these did?
Friday, Yes, my Nation eat Mans too, eat all up.
Master, Where do they carry them?
Friday, Go to other Place where they think.
Master, Do they come hither?
Friday, Yes, yes, they come hither; come ether else Place.
Master, Have you been here with thern?
Friday, Yes, I been here; [points to the N.W. Side of the Island]
which it seems was their Side.
P>y this I understood, that my Man Friday had formerly been
among the Savages, who used to come on Shore on the farther Part
of ihe Island, on the same Man-eating Occasions that he was now
brought for; and some time after, when I took the Courage to carry
him to that Side, being the same I formerly mention'd, he presently
knew the Place, and told me, he was there once when they eat up
twenty Men, two Women, and one Child; he could not tell Twenty
in English; but he numbered them by laying so many Stones on a
Row, and pointing to me to tell them over.
I have told this Passage, because it introduces what follows; that
after I had had this Discourse with him, I asked him how far it was
from our Island to the Shore, and whether the Canoes were not often
lost; he told me there was no Danger, no Canoes ever lost; but that
after a little way out to the Sea, there was a Current, and Wind,
always one way in the Morning, the other in the Afternoon.
This I understood to be no more than the Sets of the Tide, as going
out, or coming in; but I afterwards understood, it was occasion'd by
the great Draft and Reflux of the mighty River Oroonooko; in the
Mouth, or the Gulf of which River, as I found afterwards, our Island
lay; and this Land which I perceiv'd to the W. and N. W. was the
great Island Trinidad, on the North Point of the Mouth of the River;
I asked Friday a thousand Questions about the Country, the Inhabi-
touts, the Sea, the Coast, and what Nation were near; he told me al
he knew with the greatest Openness imaginable; I asked him the
Names of the several Nations of his Sort of People, but could get no
other Name than Caribs; from whence I easily understood, that these
were the Caribbees, which our Maps place on the Part of America
which reaches from the Mouth of the River Oroonooko to Guiana, and
onwards to St. Martha: Ke told me that up a great way beyond the
Moon, that was, beyond the Setting of the Moon, which must be W.
from their Country, there dwelt white-bearded Men, like me, and
pointed to my great Whiskers, which I mention'd before; and that
they had killed much Mans, that was his Word; by all which I under-
stood, he meant the Spaniards, whose Cruelties in America had been
spread over the whole Countries, and was remember'd by all the
Nations from Father to Son.
I inquir'd if he could tell me how I might come from this Island,
and get among those white Men; he told me, yes, yes, I might go in
two Canoe; I could not understand what he meant, or make him de-
scribe to me what he meant by two Canoe, till at last with great Diffi-
culty, I found he meant it must be in a large great Boat, as big as two
Canoes.
This Part of Friday's Discourse began to relish with me very well,
and from this Time I entertain'd some Hopes, that one Time or
other, I might find an Opportunity to make my Escape from this
Place; and that this poor Savage might be a Means to help me to
do it
During the long Time that Friday has now been with me, and that
he began to speak to me, and understand me, I was not wanting to
lay a Foundation of religious Knowledge in his Mind; particularly J
asked him one Time who made him? The poor Creature did not
understand me at all, but thought I had asked who was his Father;
but I took it by another handle, and asked him who made the Sea,
the Ground we walked on, and the Hills, and Woods; he told me it
was one old Benamuckee, that lived beyond all: He could describe
nothing of this great Person, but that he was very old; much older
he said than the Sea, or the Land; than the Moon, or the Stars: 1
asked him then, if this old Person had made all Things, why did not
all Things worship him; he look'd very grave, and with a perfect
Look of Innocence, said, All Things do say O to him: I asked him
if the People who die in his Country went away anywhere; he siid
fRnc("tn AND PRIPAY ON AN NXPFniTION.—P. lt}K
yes, they all went to Benamuckee; then I asked him whether these
they eat up went thither too, he said yes.
From these Things, I began to instruct him in the Knowledge of
the true God: I told him that the great Maker of all Things lived
up there, pointing up towards Heaven: That he governs the World
by the same Power and Providence by which he had made it: That
he was omnipotent, could do everything for us, give everything to us,
take everything from us; and thus by Degrees I open'd his Eyes.
He listened with great Attention, and receiv'd with Pleasure the Notion
of Jesus Christ being sent to redeem us, and of the Manner of making
our Prayers to God, and his being able to hear us, even into Heaven;
he told me one Day, that if our God could hear us up beyond the
Sun, he must needs be a greater God than their Benamuckee, who
lived but a little way off, and yet could not hear, till they went up to
the great Mountains where he dwelt, to speak to him; I asked him
if ever he went thither, to speak to him; he said no, they never
went that were young Men; none went thither but the old Men, who
he called their Oowocakee, that is, as I made him explain it to me,
their Religious, or Clergy, and that they went to say O, (so he called
saying Prayers) and then came back, and told them what Benamuckee
said: By this I observ'd, That there is Priestcraft, even amongst the
most blinded ignorant Pagans in the World; and the Policy of making
a secret Religion, in order to preserve the Veneration of the People
to the Clergy, is not only to be found in the Roman, but perhaps
among all Religions in the World, even among the most brutish and
barbarous Savages.
I endeavour'd to clear up this Fraud, to my Man Friday, and told
him, that the Pretence of their old Men going up the Mountains,
to say O to their God Benamuckee, was a Cheat, and their bringing
Word from thence what he said, was much more so; that if they met
with any Answer, or spake with any one there, it must be with an evil
Spirit: And then I enter'd into a long Discourse with him about the
Devil, the Original of him, his Rebellion against God, his Enmity to
Man, the Reason of it, his setting himself up in the dark Parts of the
World to be Worshipp'd instead of God, and as God; and the many
Stratagems he made use of to delude Mankind to his Ruin; how
he had a secret access to our Passions, and to our Affections, to
adapt his Snares so to our Inclinations, as to cause us even to be our
own Tempters, and to run upon our Destruction by our own Choice.
1
I found it was not so easy to imprint right Notions in his Mind
about the Devil, as it was about the Being of a God. Nature assisted
all my Arguments to Evidence to him, even the Necessity of a great first
Cause and over-ruling governing Power; a secret directing Providence,
and of the Equity, and Justice, of paying Homage to him that made us,
and the like. But there appeared nothing of all this in the Notion of an
evil Spirit; of his Original, his Being, his Nature, and above all of his
Inclination to do Evil, and to draw us in to do so too; and the poor
Creature puzzled me once in such a Manner, by a Question merely
natural and innocent, that I scarce knew what to say to him. I had
been talking a great deal to him of the Power of God, his Omnipo-
tence, his dreadful Antipathy to Sin, his being a consuming Fire to the
Workers of Iniquity; how, as he had made us all, he could destroy
us and all the World in a Moment; and he listen'd with great Serious-
ness to me all the while.
After this, I had been tellling him how the Devil was God's Enemy
in the Hearts of Men, and used all his Malice and Skill to defeat the
good Designs of Providence, and to ruin the Kingdom of Christ in
the World; and the like, Well, says Friday, but you say, God is so
strong, so great, is he not much string, much might as the Devil?
Yes, yes, says I, Friday, God is stronger than the Devil, God is
above the Devil, and therefore we pray to God to tread him down
under our Feet, and enable us to resist his Temptations and quench
his fiery Darts. But, says he again, if God much strong, much might
as the Devil, why God no kill the Devil, so make him no more do
-wicked?
I was strangely surpris'd at his Question, and after all, though I
was now an old Man, yet I was but a young Doctor, and ill enough
qualified for a Casuist, or a Solver of Difficulties: And at first I
could not tell what to say, so I pretended not to hear him, and asked
him what he said? But he was too earnest for an Answer to forget
his Question; so that he repeated it in the very same broken Words,
as above. By this time I had recovered myself a little, and I said,
God will at last punish him severely; he is reserv'd for the Judgment,
and is to be cast into the Bottomless Pit, to dwell with everlasting Fire.
This did not satisfy Friday, but he returns upon me, repeating my
Words, Reserve, at last, me no understand; but, Why not kill the
Devil now, not kill great ago? You may as well ask me, said I, Why
God does not kill vou and I, when we do wicked Things here that
offend him? We are preseiVd to repent and be pardon'd: He muses
a while at this; well, well, says he, mighty affectionately, that well;
so you, I, Devil, all wicked, all preserve, repent, God pardon all. Here
I was run down again by him to the last Degree, and it was a Testi-
mony to me, how the mere Notions of Nature, though they will guide
reasonable Creatures to the Knowledge of a God, and of a Worship or
Homage due to the supreme Being, of God as the Consequence
of our Nature; yet nothing but divine Revelation can form the
Knowledge of Jesus Christ, and of a Redemption purchas'd for us, of
a Mediator of the new Covenant, and of an Intercessor, at the Foot-
stool of God's Throne; I say, nothing but a Revelation from Heaven,
can form these in the Soul; and that therefore the Gospel of our
Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ; I mean, the Word of God, and the
Spirit of God promised for the Guide and Sanctifier of his People,
are the absolutely necessary Instructors of the Souls of Men, in the
saving Knowledge of God, and the Means of Salvation.
I therefore diverted the present Discourse between me and my
Man, rising up hastily, as upon some sudden Occasion of going out;
then sending him for something a good way off, I seriously prayed to
God that he would enable me to instruct savingly this poor Savage,
assisting by his Spirit the Heart of the poor ignorant Creature, to
receive the Light of the Knowledge of God in Christ, reconciling him
to himself, and would guide me to speak so to him from the Word of
God, as his Conscience might be convinc'd, his Eyes opened, and his
Soul saved. When he came again to me, I enter'd into a long Dis-
course with him upon the Subject of the Redemption of Man by the
Saviour of the World, and of the Doctrine of the Gospel preach'd
from Heaven, viz. of Repentance towards God, and Faith in our
Blessed Lord Jesus. I then explain'd to him, as well as I could, why
our Blessed Redeemer took not on him the Nature of Angels, but the
Seed of Abraham, and how for that Reason the fallen Angels had no
Share in the Redemption; that he came only to the lost Sheep of
the House of Israel, and the like.
I had, God knows, more Sincerity than Knowledge, in all the
Methods I took for this poor Creature's Instruction, and must
acknowledge what I believe all that act upon the same Principle will
find, That in laying Things open to him, I really inform'd and
instructed myself in many Things, that either I did not know, or had
not fully consider'd before, but which occurr'd naturally to my Mind,
upon my searching into them, for the Information of this poor
Savage; and I had more Affection in my Inquiry after Things upon
this Occasion, than ever I felt before; so that whether this poor
wild Wretch was the better for me, or no, I had great Reason to be
thankful that ever he came to me: My Grief set lighter upon me, my
Habitation grew comfortable to me beyond Measure; and when I re-
flected that in this solitary Life which I had been confin'd to, I had
not only been moved myself to look up to Heaven, and to seek to
the Hand that had brought me there; but was now to be made an Instru-
ment under Providence to save the Life, and, for ought I knew, the
Soul of a poor Savage, and bring him to the true Knowledge of
Religion, and of the Christian Doctrine, that he might know Christ
Jesus, to know whom is Life eternal; I say, When I reflected upon all
these Things, a secret Joy run through every Part of my Soul, and I
frequently rejoic'd that ever I was brought to this Place, which I had
so often thought the most dreadful of all Afflictions that could possibly
have befallen me.
In this thankful Frame I continu'd all the Remainder of my Time,
and the Conversation which employ'd the Hours between Friday and
I, was such, as made the three Years which we lived there together
perfectly and completely happy, //" any such Thing as complete Happi-
ness can be formed in a sublunary State. The Savage was now a good
Christian, a much better than I; though I have reason to hope, and
bless God for it, that we were equally penitent, and comforted restor'd
Penitents; we had here the Word of God to read, and no farther off
from his Spirit to instruct, than if we had been in England.
I always apph/d myself in Reading the Scripture, to let him know,
as well as I could, the Meaning of what I read; and he again, by his
serious Inquiries and Questions, made me, / said before, a much
better Scholar in the Scripture Knowledge, than I should ever have
been by my own private mere Reading. Another thing I cannot
refrain from observing here also from Experience, in this retir'd Part
of my Life, viz. How infinite and inexpressible a Blessing it is, that
the Knowledge of God, and of the Doctrine of Salvation by Christ
fesus, is so plainly laid down in the Word of God; so easy to be
receiv'd and understood: That as the bare reading the Scripture made
me capable of understanding enough of my Duty, to carry me directly
on to the great Work of sincere Repentance for my Sins, and laying
hold of a Saviour for Life and Salvation, to a stated Reformation in
Practice, and Obedience to all God's commands, and this without any
Teacher or Instructor; I mean, human; so the same plain Instruction
lufficiently served to the enlightening this Savage Creature, and bring-
ing him to be such a Christian, as I have known few equal to him in
my Life.
As to all the Disputes, Wranglings, Strife, and Contention, which
has happen'd in the World about Religion, whether Niceties in
Doctrines, or Schemes of Church Government, they were all perfectly
useless to us; as for ought I can yet see, they have been to all the
rest of the World: We had the sure Guide to Heaven, viz. The Word
of God; and we had, blessed be God, comfortable Views of the Spirit
of God teaching and instructing us by his Word, leading us into all
Truth, and making us both willing and obedient to the Instruction of
his Word; and I cannot see the least Use that the greatest Knowledge
of the disputed Points in Religion which have made such Confusions
in the World would have been to us, if we could have obtain'd it #
but I must go on with the Historical Part of Things, and take every
Part in its Order.
After Friday and I became more intimately acquainted, and that
he could understand almost all I said to him, and speak fluently,
though in broken English, to me; I acquainted him with my own
Story, or at least so much of it as related to my coming into the
Place, how I had lived there, and how long. I let him into the
Mystery, for such it was to him, of Gunpowder and Bullet, and taught
him how to shoot: I gave him a Knife, which he was wonderfully
delighted with, and I made him a Belt, with a Frog hanging to it,
such as in England we wear Hangers in; and in the Frog, instead of
a Hanger, I gave him a Hatchet, which was not only as good a
Weapon in some Cases, but much more useful upon other Occasions.
I describ'd to him the Country of Europe, and particularly England,
which I came from; how we lived, how we worshipp'd God, how we
behav'd to one another; and how we traded in Ships to all Parts of
the World: I gave him an Account of the Wreck which I had been
on board of, and showed him as near as I could, the Place where she
lay; but she was all beaten in Pieces before, and gone.
I showed him the Ruins of our Boat, which we lost when we escap'd,
and which I could not stir with my whole Strength then, but was now
fallen almost all to Pieces: Upon seeing this Boat, Friday stood
musing a great while, and said nothing; I asked him what it was he
Itudied upon; at last says he, me see such Boat like come to Place at
my Nation.
I did not understand him a good while; but at last, when I had
examin'd farther into it, I understood by him, that a Boat, such as
that had been, came on Shore upon the Country where he lived; that
is, as he explain'd it, was driven thither by Stress of Weather: I pre-
sently imagin'd, that some European Ship must have been cast away
upon their Coast, and the Boat might get loose, and drive ashore;
but was so dull, that I never once thought of Men making escape
from a Wreck thither, much less whence they might come; so I only
inquir'd after a Description of the Boat
Friday describ'd the Boat to me well enough; but brought me
better to understand him, when he added with some Warmth, we save
the white Mans from drown: Then I presently asked him, if there
was any white Mans, as he called them, in the Boat; yes, he said,
the Boat full white Mans: I asked him how many; he told upon
his Fingers seventeen: I asked him then what become of them; he
told me, they live, they dwell at my Nation.
This put new Thoughts into my Head; for I presently imagin'd,
that these might be the Men belonging to the Ship, that was cast away
in Sight of my Island, as I now call it; and who after the Ship was
struck on the Rock, and they saw her inevitably lost, had saved
themselves in their Boat, and were landed upon that wild Shore
among the Savages.
Upon this, I inquir'd of him more critically, What was become of
them? He assur'd me they lived still there; that they had been there
about four Years; that the Savages let them alone, and gave them
Victuals to live. I asked him, How it came to pass they did not kill
them and eat them? He said, No, they make Brother with them; that
is, as I understood him, a Truce: And then he added, They no eat
Mans but when make the War fight; that is to say, they never eat
any Men, but such as come to fight with them, and are taken in
Battle.
It was after this some considerable Time, that being upon the Top of
the Hill, at the East Side of the Island, from whence as I have said,
I had in a clear Day discover'd the Main, or Continent of America;
Friday, the Weather being very serene, looks very earnestly towards
the main Land, and in a kind of Surprise, falls a jumping and dancing,
and calls out to me for I was at some Distance from him: I asked
him, What was the Matter? 0 Joy 1 says he, O glad I There see mj
Country, there my Nation I
I observ'd an extraordinary Sense of Pleasure appear'd in his Face,
and his Eyes sparkled, and his Countenance discover'd a strange
Eagerness, as if he had a Mind to be in his own Country again; and
this Observation of mine, put a great many Thoughts into me, which
made me at first not so easy about my new Man Friday as I was be-
fore; and I made no Doubt, but that if Friday could get back to his
own Nation again, he would not only forget all his Religion, but all his
Obligation to me; and would be forward enough to give his Country-
men an Account of me, and come back perhaps with a hundred or
two of them, and make a Feast upon me, at which he might be as
merry as he used to be with those of his Enemies, when they were
taken in War.
But I wronged the poor honest Creature very much, for which ]
was very sorry afterwards. However as my Jealousy increased, and
held me some Weeks, I was a little more circumspect, and not so
familiar and kind to him as before; in which I was certainly in the
Wrong too, the honest grateful Creatuie having no thought about it,
but what consisted with the best Principles, both as a religious
Christian, and as a grateful Friend, as appeared afterwards to my full
Satisfaction.
While my Jealousy of him lasted, you may be sure I was every
Day pumping him to see if he would discover any of the new
Thoughts, which I suspected were in him; but I found everything
he said was so Honest, and so innocent, that I could find nothing to
nourish my Suspicion; and in spite of all my Uneasiness he made
me at last entirely his own again, nor did he in the least perceive that
I was uneasy, and therefore I could not suspect him of Deceit
One Day walking up the same Hill, but the Weather being hazy at
Sta, so that we could not see the Continent, I called to him, and
said, Friday, do not you wish yourself in your own Country, your
own Nation? Yes, he said, he be much 0 glad to be at his own Nation.
What would you do there, said I, would you turn wild again, eat
Men's Flesh again, and be a Savage as you were before. He looked
full of Concern, and shaking his Head said, No, no, Friday tell them
to live good, tell them to pray God, tell them to eat Corn-bread, Cattle-flesh,
Milk, no eat Man again: Why then, said I to him, They will kill you.
He looked grave at that, and then said, No, they no kill me, the?
wilting love learn: He meant by this, they would would be willing to
learn. He added, they learnt much of the Bearded-Mans that come
in the Boat Then I asked him if he would go back to them? He
smiled at that, and told me he could not swim so far. I told him I
would make a Canoe for him. He told me, he would go if I would
go with him. I go! says I, why, they will eat me if I come there?
No, no, says he, me make they no Eat you; me make they much Love you.
He meant, he would tell them how I had killed his Enemies, and
saved his Life, and so he would make them love me; then he told
me as well as he could, how kind they were to seventeen White
men, or Bearded-men, as he called them, who came on Shore
there in Distress.
From this time I confess I had a Mind to venture over, and see
if I could possibly join with these Bearded-men, who I made no
Doubt were Spaniards or Portuguese; not doubting but if I could
we might find some Method to Escape from thence, being upon the
Continent, and a good Company together; better Uian I could from
an Island 40 Miles off the Shore, and alone with mt Help. <>o after
some Days I took Friday to work again, by waj of Discourse, and
told him I would give him a Boat to go back to his own Nation; and
accordingly I carried him to my Frigate which lay on the other Side
of the Island, and having cleared it of Water, for I always kept it
sunk in the Water; I brought it out, showed it him, and we both went
into it
I found he was a most dexterous Fellow at managing it, would make
it go almost as swift and fast again as I could; so when he was in, I
said to him, Well, now, Friday, shall we go to your Nation? He
looked very dull at my saying so, which it seems was, because he
thought the Boat too small to go so far. I told him then I had a
bigger; so the next Day I went to the Place where the first Boat lay
which I had made, but which I could not get into Water: He said
that was big enough; but then as I had taken no Care of it, and it
had lain two or three-and-twenty Years there, the Sun had split and
dried it, that it was in a manner rotten. Friday told me such a Boat
would do very well, and would carry much enough Vittle, Drink, Breaa\
that was his Way of Talking.
Upon the whole, I was by this Time so fixed upon my Design oi
going over with him to the Continent, that I told him we would go
and make one as big as that, and he should go home in it He
tnswer'd not one Word, but looked very grave and sad: I asked him
what was the matter with him? He asked me again thus; Why, you
angry mad with Friday, what me done? I asked him what he meant;
I told him I was not angry with him at all. No angry I No angry I
says he, repeating the Words several Times, Why send Friday home
away to my Nation? Why (says I) Friday, did you not say you wished
you were there? Yes, yes, says he, wish we be both there, no wish
Friday there, no Master there. In a Word, he would not think of going
there without me; I go there I Friday, (says I) what shall I do there?
He turned very quick upon me at this: You do great deal much good,
says he, you teach wild Mans be good sober tame Mans; you tell them
know God, fray God, and live new Life. Alas I Friday, (says I) thou
knowest not what thou sayest, I am but an ignorant Man myself.
Yes, yes, says he,you teachee me Good, you teachee them Good. No, no,
Friday, (says I) you shall go without me, leave me here to live by
myself, as I did before. He looked confus'd again at that Word, and
running to one of the Hatchets which he used to wear, he takes it up
hastily, comes and gives it me. What must I do with this? says I to
him. You take, kill Friday (says he.) Whatmust Ikill'you for? said
I again. He returns very quick, What you send Friday away for?
take, kill Friday, no send Friday away. This he spoke so earnestly,
that I saw Tears stand in his Eyes: In a Word, I so plainly dis-
cover'd the utmost Affection in him to me, and a firm Resolution in
him, that I told him then, and often after, that I would never send
him away from me, if he was willing to stay with me.
Upon ihe whole, as I found by all his Discourse a settled Affection
to me, and that nothing should part him from me, so I found all the
Foundation of his Desire to go to his own Country, was laid in his
ardent Affection to the People, and his Hopes of my doing them good;
a Thing which as I had no Notion of myself, so I had not the least
Thought or Intention, or Desire of undertaking it But still I founo.
a strong Inclination to my attempting an Escape as above, founded on
the Supposition gather'd from the Discourse, (viz.) That there were
seventeen bearded Men there; and therefore, without any more Delay,
I went to Work with Friday to find out a great Tree proper to fell, and
make a large Periagua or Canoe to undertake the Voyage. There
were Trees enough in the Island to have built a little Fleet, not of
Periaguas and Canoes, but even of good large Vessels. But the
main Thing I looked at, was to get one so near the Watei that we
might launch it when it was made, to avoid the Mistake I committed
at first
At last, Friday pitched upon a Tree, for I found he knew muck
better than I what kind of Wood was fittest for it, nor can I tell to
this Day what Wood to call the Tree we cut down, except that i«
was very like the Tree we call Fustic, or between that and the
Nicaragua Wood, for it was much of the same Colour and Smell
Friday was for burning the Hollow or Cavity of this Tree out to make
it for a Boat But I showed him how rather to cut it out with Tools,
which, after I had showed him how to use, he did very handily, and
in about a Month's hard Labour, we finished it, and made it very
handsome, especially when with our Axes, which I showed him how
to handle, wc cut and hewed the outside into the true Shape of t

Boat; after this, however, it cost us near a Fortnight's Time to get
her along as it were Inch by Inch upon great Rollers into *hv.
Water. But when she was in, she would have carried twenty Men
with great Ease.
When she was in the Water, and though she was so big it amazed
me to see with what Dexterity and how swift my Man Friday would
manage her, turn her, and paddle her along; so I asked him if he
would, and if we might venture over in her; Yes, he said, he venture
9ver in her very well, though great blow Wind. However, I had a
farther Design that he knew nothing of, and that was to make a Mast
«nd Sail and to fit her with an Anchor and Cable: As to a Mast,
that was easy enough to get; so I pitched upon a straight young
Cedar-Tree, which I found near the Place, and which there was great
»oj
Plenty of in the Island, and I set Friday to Work to cut it down, and
gave him Directions how to shape and order it But as to the Sail, that
was my particular Care; I knew I had old Sails, or rather Pieces of old
Sails enough; but as I had had them now six-and-twenty Years by me,
and had not been very careful to preserve them, not imagining that I
should ever have this kind of Use for them, I did not doubt but they
were all rotten, and indeed most of them were so; however, I found
two Pieces which appear'd pretty good, and with these I went to
Work, and with a
great deal of Pains,
and awkward te-
dious stitching (you
may be sure) for
Want of Needles, I
at length made a
three Corner'd ugly
Thing, like what we
call in England, a
Shoulder of Mutton
Sail, to go with a
Boom at bottom, and
a little short Sprit
at the Top, such
as usually our Ship's
Long-Boatssail with,
and such as I best
knew how to man-
age; because it was
such a one as I had
to the Boat, in which
I made my Escape
from Barbary, as
related in the first
Part of my Story.
I was near two Months performing this last Work, viz. rigging and
fitting my Mast and Sails; for I finish'd them very complete, making
& small Stay, and a Sail, or Foresail to it, to assist, if we should turn
to Windward; and which was more than all, I fixed a Rudder to the
Stern of her, to steer with; and though I was but a bungling Ship

wright, yet as I knew the Usefulness, and even Necessity of such a
Thing, I applied myself with so much Pains to do it, that at last I
brought it to pass; though considering the many dull Contrivances I
had for it that failed, I think it cost me almost as much Labour as
making the Boat
After all this was done too, I had my Man Friday to teach as to
what belong'd to the Navigation of my Boat; for though he knew
very well how to paddle a Canoe, he knew nothing what belong'd to
a Sail and a Rudder; and was the most amaz'd, when he saw me
work the Boat to and again in the Sea by the Rudder, and how the
Sail gibbed, and filled this way or that way, as the Course we sailed
changed; I say, when he saw this, he stood like one astonish'd and
amaz'd: However, with a little Use, I made all these Things familiar
to him; and he became an expert Sailor, except that as to the Com-
pass, I could make him understand very little of that On the other
hand, as there was very little cloudy Weather, and seldom or never
any Fogs in those Parts, there was the less occasion for a Compass,
seeing the Stars were always to be seen by Night, and the Shore by
Day, except in the rainy Seasons, and then nobody cared to stir
abroad, either by Land or Sea.
I was now enter'd on the seven-and-twentieth Year of my Cap-
tivity in this Place; though the three last Years that I had this Crea-
ture with me, ought rather to be left out of the Account, my Habi-
tation being quite of another kind than in all the rest of the Time.
I kept the Anniversary of my Landing here with the same Thankful-
ness to God for his Mercies, as at first; and if I had such Cause of
Acknowledgment at first; I had much more so now, having such
»dditional Testimonies of the Care of Providence over me, and the
great Hopes I had of being effectually, and speedily deliver'd; for I
had an invincible Impression upon my Thoughts, that my Deli-
verance was at hand, and that I should not be another Year in this
Placr ! However, I went on with my Husbandry, digging, planting,
fencing, as usual; I gather'd and cured my Grapes, and did every
necessary Thing as before.
The rainy Season was in the meantime upon me, when I kept
more within Doors than at other Times; so I had stowed our new
Vessel as secure as we could, bringing her up into the Creek, where
as I said, in the Beginning I landed my Rafts from the Ship, and
hauling her up to the Shore, at high Water mark, I made my Mao
Friday dig a little Dock, just big enough to hold her, and just deep
enough to give her Water enough to float in; and then when the
Tide was out, we made a strong Dam cross the End of it, to keep the
Water out; and so she lay dry, as to the Tide from the Sea; and to
keep the Rain off, we laid a great many Boughs of Trees, so thick,
that she was as well thatched as a House; and thus we waited
for the Month of November and December, in which I design'd to
make my Adventure.
When the settled Season began to come in, as the thought of my
Design return'd with the fair Weather, I was preparing daily for the
Voyage; and the first Thing I did, was to lay by a certain Quantity
of Provisions, being the Stores for our Voyage ; and intended in a
Week or a Fortnight's Time, to open the Dock, and launch out our
Boat I was busy one Morning upon something of this kind, when
I called to Friday, and bid him go to the Sea Shore, and see if he
could find a Turtle, or Tortoise, a Thing which we generally got once
a Week, for the Sake of the Eggs, as well as the Flesh: Friday had
not been long gone, when he came running back, and flew over my
outer Wall, or Fence, like one that felt not the Ground, or the Steps
he set his Feet on; and before I had time to speak to him, he cries
out to me, O Master I O Master I O SorrowI ObadI What's the
Matter, Friday, says I; O yonder, there, says he, one, two, three
Canoe I one, two, three / By his way of speaking, I concluded there
were six; but on inquiry, I found it was but three: Well, Friday,
says I, do not be frighted; so I heartened him up as well as I
could: However, I saw the poor Fellow was most terribly scared; for
nothing ran in his Head but that they were come to look for him,
and would cut him in Pieces, and eat him; and the poor Fellow
trembled so, that I scarce knew what to do with him: I comforted
him as well as I could, and told him I was in as much Danger as he,
and that they would eat me as well as him; but, says I, Friday, we
must resolve to fight them; Can you fight, Friday? Me sIwot, says he,
but there come many great Number. No matter for that, said I again,
our Guns will fright them that we do not kill; so I asked him,
Whether if I resolv'd to defend him, he would defend me, and stand
by me, and do just as I bid him? He said, Me die, when you bid die,
Master; so I went and fetched a good Dram of Rum, and gave him;
for I had been so good a Husband of my Rum, that I had a great
deal left: When he had drank it, I made him take the two Fowling-
Pieces, which we always carried, and load them with large Swan-Shot,
as big as small Pistol Bullets; then I took four Muskets, and loaded
them with two Slugs, and five small Bullets each; and my two Pistols
I loaded with a Brace of Bullets each; I hung my great Sword as
usual, naked by my Side, and gave Friday his Hatchet
When I had thus prepar'd myself, I took my Perspective-Glass,
and went up to the Side of the Hill, to see what I could discover;
and I found quickly, by my Glass, that there were one-and-twenty
Savages, three Prisoners, and three Canoes; and that their whole
Business seemed to be the triumphant Banquet upon these three
human Bodies, (a barbarous Feast indeed) but nothing more than
as I had observ'd was usual with them.
I observ'd also, that they were landed not where they had done,
when Friday made his Escape; but nearer to my Creek, where the
Shore was low, and where a thick Wood came close almost down
to the Sea: This, with the Abhorrence of the inhuman Errand
these Wretches came about, filled me with such Indignation, that
I came down again to Friday, and told him, I was resolv'd to go
down to them, and kill them all; and asked him, If he would
Stand by me? He was now gotten over his Fright, and his Spirits
being a little raised, with the Dram I had given him, he was
very cheerful, and told me, as before, he would die, when 1
bid die.
In this Fit of Fury, I took first and divided the Arms which I
had charged, as before, between us: I gave Friday one Pistol to
stick in his Girdle, and three Guns upon his Shoulder; and I took
one Pistol, and the other three myself; and in this Posture we
marched out: I took a small Bottle of Rum in my Pocket, and gave
Friday a large Bag, with more Powder and Bullet; and as to Orders,
I charged him to keep close behind me, and not to stir, or shoot, or
do anything, till I bid him; and in the meantime, not to speak a
Word: In this Posture I fetched a Compass to my Right-Hand, of
near a Mile, as well to get over the Creek, as to get into the Wood;
so that I might come within shot of them, before I should be dis-
cover'd, which I had seen by my Glass, it was easy to do.
While I was making this March, my former Thoughts returning, I
began to abate my Resolution; I do not mean, that I entertain'd
any Fear of their Number; for as they were naked, unarm'd Wretches,
it is certain I was superior to them; nay, though I had been alone;
but it occurr'd to my Thoughts, What Call? What Occasion? much
"ess, What Necessity I was in to go and dip my Hands in Blood, to
attack People, who had neither done, or intended me any Wrong?
Who as to me were innocent, and whose barbarous Customs were
their own Disaster, being in them a Token indeed of God's having
left them, with the other Nations of that Part of the World, to such
Stupidity, and to such inhuman Courses; but did not call me to take
upon me to be a Judge of their Actions, much less an Executioner of
his Justice; that whenever he thought fit, he would take the Cause
into his own Hands, and by national Vengeance punish them as a
People, for national Crimes; but that in the meantime, it was none of
my Business; that it was true, Friday might justify it, because he
was a declar'd Enemy, and in a State of War with those very parti-
cular People; and it was lawful for him to attack them; but I could
not say the same with respect to me: These Things were so warmly
pressed upon my Thoughts, all the way as I went, that I resolv'd I
would only go and place myself near them, that I might observe
their barbarous Feast, and that I would act then as God should
direct; but that unless something offer'd that was more a Call to me
than yet I knew of, I would not meddle with them.
With this Resolution I enter'd the Wood, and with all possible
Wariness and Silence, Friday following close at my Heels, I marched
till I came to the Skirt of the Wood, on the Side which was next to
them; only that one Corner of the Wood lay between me and them;
here I called softly to Friday, and showing him a great Tree, which
was just at the Corner of the Wood, I bade him go to the Tree,
and bring me Word if he could see there plainly what they were do-
ing; he did so, and came immediately back to me, and told me they
might be plainly viewed there; that they were all about their Fire,
eating the Flesh of one of their Prisoners; and that another lay bound upon
the Sand, a little from them, which he said they would kill next, and
which fired all the very Soul within me; he told me it was not one
of their Nation; but one of the bearded Men, who he had told me
of, that came to their Country in the Boat; I was filled with Horror
it the very naming the white-bearded Man, and going to the Tree,
I saw plainly by my Glass, a white Man who lay upon the Beach of
the Sea, with his Hands and his Feet tied, with Flags, or Things like
Rushes; and that he was an European, and had Clothes on.
There was another Tree, and a little Thicket beyond it, about
ADVENTURES OF
fifty Yards nearer to them than the Place where I was, which by go-
ing a little way about, I saw I might come at undiscover'd, and that
then I should be within half Shot of them; so I withheld my Passion,
though I was indeed enrag'd to the highest Degree, and going back
about twenty Paces, I got behind some Bushes, which held all the
way, till I came to the other Tree; and then I came to a little rising
Ground, which gave me a full View of them, at the Distance of about
eighty Yards.
I had now not a Moment to lose; for nineteen of the dreadful
Wretches sat upon the Ground, all close huddled together, and had
just sent the other two to butcher the poor Christian, and bring him
perhaps Limb by Limb to their Fire, and they were stooped down to

untie the Bands, at his Feet; I turned to Friday, now Iriday, said
I, do as I bid thee; Friday said he would; then Friday, says 1, do
exactly as you see me do, fail in nothing; so I set down one of
the Muskets, and the Fowling Piece, upon the Ground, and Friday
did the like by his; and with the other Musket, I took my aim at
the Savages, bidding him do the like; then asking him, If he was
ready? He said, yes; then fire at them, said I; and the same Moment
I fired also.
Friday took his Aim so much better than I, that on the Side that
he shot, he killed two of them, and wounded three more; and on
my Side, I killed one, and wounded two: They were, you may be
sure, in a dreadful Consternation; and all of them, who were not
hurt, jumped up upon their Feet, but did not immediately know
which way to run, or which way to look; for they knew not from
whence their Destruction came: Friday kept his Eyes close upon me,
that as I had bid him, he might observe what I did; so as soon as the
first Shot was made, I threw down the Piece, and took up the Fow-
ling Piece, and Friday did the like; he see me cock, and present,
he did the same again; Are you ready, Friday? said I; yes, says
he; let fly then, says I, in the Name of God, and with that I fired
again among the amaz'd Wretches, and so did Friday; and as our
Pieces were now loaded with what I called Swan-Shot, or small Pistol
Bullets, we found only two drop; but so many were wounded, that
they ran about yelling, and screaming, like mad Creatures, all bloody,
and miserably wounded, most of them; whereof three more fell
quickly after, though not quite dead.
Now Friday, says I, laying down the discharg'd Pieces, and
taking up the Musket, which was yet loaded; follow me, says I,
which he did, with a great deal of Courage; upon which I rushed
out of the Wood, and showed myself, and Friday close at my Foot,
as soon as I perceiv'd they saw me, I shouted as loud as I could,
and bade Friday do so too; and running as fast as I could, which
by the way, was not very fast, being laden with Arms as I was, I made
directly towards the poor Victim, who was, as I said, lying upon the
Scach, or Shore, between the Place where they sat, and the Sea; the
two Butchers who were just going to work with him, had left
him, at the Surprise of our first Fire, and fled in a terrible Fright,
to the Sea Side, and had jumped into a Canoe, and three more of
the rest made the same way; I turned to Friday, and bid
him step forwards, and fire at them; he understood me immediately,
and running about forty Yards, to be near them, he shot at them, and
I thought he had killed them all; for I saw them all fall of a Heap
into the Boat; though I saw two of them up again quickly: However,
he killed two of them, and wounded the third; so that he lay down
in the Bottom of the Boat, as if he had been dead.
While my Man Friday fired at them, I pulled out my Knife, and
cut the Flags that bound the poor Victim, and loosing his Hands,
and Feet, I lifted him up, and asked him in the Portuguese Tongue,
What he was? He answer'd in Latin, Christianus; but was so weak,
And faint, that he could scarce stand, or speak; I took my Bottle
->ut of my Pocket, and gave it him, making Signs that he should
drink, which he did; and I gave him a Piece of Bread, which he ate;
then I asked him, What Countryman he was? And he said EspagnoU',
wd being a little recover'd, let me know by all the Signs he could
possibly make, how much he was in my Debt for his Deliverance;
Seignior, said I, with as much Spanish as I could make up, we will
talk afterwards; but we must fight now; if you have any Strength left,
take this Pistol, and Sword, and lay about you; he took them very
thankfully, and no sooner had he the Arms in his Hands, but as if
they had put new Vigour into him, he flew upon his Murderers, like
a Fury, and had cut two of them in Pieces, in an instant; for the
Truth is, as the whole was a Surprise to them; so the poor Creatures
were so much frighted with the Noise of our Pieces, that they fell
down for mere Amazement, and Fear; and had no more Power to
attempt their own Escape, than their Flesh had to resist our Shot;
and that was the Case of those Five that Friday shot at in the Boat;
for as three of them fell with the Hurt they receiv'd, so the other two
fell with the Fright
I kept my Piece in my Hand still, without firing, being willing to
keep my Charge ready ; because I had given the Spaniard'my Pistol,
and Sword; so I called to Friday, and bade him run up to the Tree,
from whence we first fired, and fetch the Arms which lay there, that
had been discharg'd, which he did with great Swiftness; and then
giving him my Musket, I sat down myself to load all the rest agan,
and bade them come to me when they wanted: While I was loading
these Pieces, there happen'd a fierce Engagement between the Span-
iard, and one of the Savages, who made at him with one of their great
wooden Swords, the same Weapon that was to have killed him before,
if I had not prevented it: The Spaniard, who was as bold, and as
brave as could be imagin'd, though weak, had fought this Indian
a good while, and had cut him two great Wounds on his Head; but
Jhe Savage being a stout lusty Fellow, closing in with him, had
thrown him down (being faint) and was wringing my Sword out of
his Hand, when the Spaniard, though undermost, wisely quitting
the Sword, drew the Pistol from his Girdle, shot the Savage through
the Body, and killed him upon the Spot; before I, who was running
to help him, could come near him.
Friday being now left to his Liberty, pursu'd the flying Wretches
rith no Weapon in his Hand, but his Hatchet; and with tnat he
dispatch'd those three, who, as I said before, were wounded at first
*nd fallen, arJ all the rest he could come up with, and the Spaniard
coming to me for a Gun, I gave him one of the Fowling Pieces, with
which he pursu'd two of the Savages, and wounded them both; but
as he was not able to run, they both got from him into the Wood,
where Friday pursu'd them, and killed one of them; but the other
was too nimble for him, and though he was wounded, yet had
plunged himself into the Sea, and swam with all his might off to those
two who were left in the Canoe, which three in the Canoe, with one
wounded, who we know not whether he died or no, were all that es-
cap'd our Hands of one-and-twenty: The Account of the Rest is as
follows:—
3 Killed at our first Shot from the Tree.
i Killed at the next Shot
a Killed by Friday in the Boat
a Killed by Ditto, of those at first wounded.
i Killed by Ditto, in the Wood.
3 Killed by the Spaniard.
4 Killed, being found dropped here and there of their Wounds,
or killed by Friday in his Chase of them.
4 Escap'd in the Boat, whereof one wounded if not dead.
ai In all
Those that were in the Canoe, worked hard to get out of Gun-Shot,
and though Friday made two or three Shots at them, I did not find
that he hit any of them: Friday would fain have had me took one
of their Canoes, and pursu'd them; and indeed I was very anxiou?
about their Escape, lest carrying the News home to their People, the)
should come back perhaps with two or three hundred of their Canoes,
and devour us by mere Multitude; so I consented to pursue them
by Sea, and running to one of their Canoes, I jumped in, and bade
Friday follow me; but when I was in the Canoe, I was surpris'd to
find another poor Creature lie there alive, bound Hand and Foot, as
the Spaniard was, for the Slaughter, and almost dead with Fear, not
knowing what the Matter was; for he had not been able to look up
over the Side of the Boat, he was tied so hard, Neck and Heels, and
had been tied so long, that he had really but little Life in him.
I immediately cut the twisted Flags, or Rushes, which they had
bound him with, and would have helped him up; but he could not stand.
A19VENTURES OF
or speak, but groaned most piteously, believing it seems still that ho
was only unbound in order to be killed.
When Friday came to him, I bade him speak to him, and tell him
of his Deliverance, and pulling out my Bottle, made him give the
poor Wretch a Dram, which, with the News of his being deliver'd,
reviv'd him, and he sat up in the Boat; but when Friday came to
hear him speak, and look in his Face, it would have moved any one
to Tears, to have seen how Friday kissed him, embrac'd him, hugged
him, cried, laughed, hollow'd, jumped about, danced, sung, then
cried again, wrung his Hands, beat his own Face, and Head, and
then sung, and jumped about again, like a distracted Creature: It
was a good while before I could make him speak to me, or tell me
what was the Matter;
but when he came a
little to himself, he
told me, that it was
his Father.
It is not easy for
me to express how
it moved me to see
what Ecstasy and
filial Affection had
worked in this poor
Savage, at the Sight
of his Father, and
of his being de-
liver'd from Death;
nor indeed can I describe half the Extravagances of his Affection after
this; for he went into the Boat, and out of the Boat a great many
times: When he went in to him, he would sit down by him, open his
Breast, and hold his Father's Head close to his Bosom, half an Hour
together, to nourish it; then he took his Arms and Ankles, which
were numbed and stiff with the Binding, and chafed and rubbed
them with his Hands; and I perceiving what the Case was, gave him
some Rum out of my Bottle, to rub them with, which did them s
great deal of Good.
This Action put an End to our Pursuit of the Canoe, with the
other Savages, who were now gotten almost out of Sight; and it was
happy for us that we did not; for ii blew so hard within two Houw

after, and before they could be gotten a Quarter of their Way, and
continued blowing so hard all Night, and that from the North-wesf
which was against them, that I could not suppose their Boat could
live, or that they ever reached to their own Coast
But to return to Friday, he was so busy about his Father, that I
could not find in my Heart to take him off for some time: But
after I thought he could leave him a little, I called him to me, and he
came jumping and laughing, and pleased to the highest Extreme;
then I asked him, If he had given his Father any Bread? He shook
his Head, and said, None: Ugly Dog eat all up self; so I gave him a
Cake of Bread out of a little Pouch I carry'd on Purpose ; I also gave
him a Dram for himself, but he would not taste it, but carry'd it to
his Father: I had in my Pocket also two or three Bunches of my
Raisins, so I gave him a Handful of them for his Father. He had no
sooner given his Father these Raisins, but I saw him come out of the
Boat, and run away, as if he had been bewitch'd, he ran at such a
Rate; for he was the swiftest Fellow of his Foot that ever I saw; I
say, he ran at such a Rate, that he was out of Sight, as it were, in an
instant; and though I called, and hollow'd too, after him, it was all
one, away he went, and in a Quarter of an Hour, I saw him come
back again, though not so fast as he went; and as he came nearer, I
found his Pace was slacker, because he had something in his Hand.
When he came up to me, I found he had been quite Home for an
Earthen Jug or Pot to bring his Father some fresh Water, and that he had
got two more Cakes, or Loaves of Bread: The Bread he gave me,
but the Water he carry'd to his Father: However, as I was very
thirsty too, I took a little Sup of it This Water reviv'd his Father
more than all the Rum or Spirits I had given him; for he was just
fainting with Thirst
When his Father had drank, I called to him to know if there was
any Water left; he said, yes; and I bade him give it to the poor
Spaniard, who was in as much Want of it as his Father; and I sent
one of the Cakes, that Friday brought, to the Spaniard too, who was
indeed very weak, and was reposing himself upon a green Place
under the Shade of a Tree; and whose Limbs were also very stiff, and
very much swelled with the rude Bandage he had been tied with.
When I saw that upon Friday's coming to him with the Water, he sat
up and drank, and took the Bread, and began to eat, I went to
him, and gave him a Handful of Raisins; he looked up in my Face
with all the Tokens of Gratitude and Thankfulness, that could ap-
pear in any Countenance; but was so weak, notwithstanding he had
so exerted himself in the Fight, that he could not stand up upon his
Feet: he tried to do it two or three times, but was really not able,
his Ankles were so swelled and so painful to him; so I bade him sit
still and caused Friday to rub his Ankles, and bathe them with
Rum, as he had done his Father's.
I observ'd the poor affectionate Creature every two Minutes, 01
perhaps less, all the while he was here, turned his Head about, to see
if his Father was in the same Place, and Posture, as he left him sitting,
and at last he found he was not to be seen; at which he started up,
and without speaking a Word, flew with that Swiftness to him, that
one could scarce perceive his Feet to touch the Ground, as he went:
But when he came, he only found he had laid himself down to ease
his Limbs; so Friday came back to me presently, and I then spoke
to the Spaniard to let Friday help him up if he could, and lead him
lo the Boat, and then he should carry him to our Dwelling, where I
would take Care of him: But Friday, a lusty strong Fellow, took the
Spaniard quite up upon his Back, and carry'd him away to the Boat,
and set him down softly upon the Side or Gunnel of the Canoe, with
his Feet in the inside of it, and then lifted him quite in, and set him
close to his Father, and presently stepping out again, launched the
Boat off, and paddled it along the Shore faster than I could walk,
ihough the Wind blew pretty4jard too; so he brought them both safe
into our Creek; and leaving them in the Boat, runs away to fetch the
other Canoe. As he passed me, I spoke to him, and asked him,
whither he went, he told me, Go fetch more Boat; so away he went
like the Wind; for sure never Man or Horse run like him, and he had
the other Canoe in the Creek, almost as soon as I got to it by Land;
so he wafted me over, and then went to help our new Guests out
"A the Boat, which he did; but they were neither of them able to
walk; so that poor Friday knew not what to do.
To remedy this, I went to Work in my Thought, and calling to
Friday to bid them to sit down on the Bank while he came to me, I
soon made a Kind of Hand-Barrow to lay them on, and Friday and
I carry'd them up both together upon it between us: But when we
got them to the outside of our Wall or Fortification, we were at a
worse Loss than before; for it was impossible to get them over; and
I was resolv'd not to break it down: So I set to Work again; and
Friday and I, in about a Hours' time, made a very handsome Tent,
cover'd with old Sails, and above that with Boughs of Trees, being in
the Space without our outward Fence, and between that and the
Grove of young Wood which I had planted: And here we made
them two Beds of such things as I had (viz.) of good Rice-Straw,with
Blankets laid upon it to lie on, and another to cover them on each Bed.
My Island was now peopled, and I thought myself very rich in
Subjects; and it was a merry Reflection which I frequently made,
How like a King I looked. First of all, the whole Country was mj
own mere Property; so that I had an undoubted Right of Dominion.
idly, My People were perfectly subjected: I was absolute Lord and
Lawgiver; they all owed their Lives to me, and were ready to lay
down their Lives, if there had been Occasion of it, for me. It was re-
markable too, we had but three Subjects, and they were of three
different Religions. My Man Friday was a Protestant, his Father
was a Pagan and a Cannibal, and the Spaniard was a Papist: How-
ever, I allow'd Liberty of Conscience throughout my Dominions: But
this is by the Way.
As soon as I had secur'd my two weak rescued Prisoners, and
given them Shelter, and a Place to rest them upon, I began to think
of making some Provision for them: And the first thing I did, I
order'd Friday to take a yearling Goat, betwixt a Kid and a Goat,
out of my particular Flock, to be killed, when I cut off the hinder
Quarter, and chopping it into small Pieces, I set Friday to Work to
boiling and stewing, and made them a very good Dish, I assure you,
of Flesh and Broth, having put some Barley and Rice also into the
Broth; and as I cooked it without Doors, for I made no Fire within
my inner Wall, so I carry'd it all into the new Tent; and having set
a Table there for them, I sat down and eat my own Dinner also with
them, and, as well as I could, cheered them and encourag'd them; Friday
being my Interpreter, especially to his Father, and indeed to the Span-
iard too; for the Spaniard spoke the Language of the Savages pretty well.
After we had dined, or rather supped, I order'd Friday to take one
of the Canoes, and go and fetch our Muskets and other Firearms,
which for Want of time we had left upon the Place of Battle, and the
»cxt Day I order'd him to go and bury the dead Bodies of the Savages,
which lay open to the Sun, and would presently be offensive; and I
also order'd him to bury the horrid Remains of their barbarous Feast,
which I knew were pretty much, and which I could not think of doing
myself; nay, I could not bear to see them, if I went that Way: AD
which he punctually performed, and defaced the very Appearance oJ
the Savages being there; so that when I went again, I could scarce
know where it was, otherwise than by the Corner of the Wood pointing
to the Place.
I then began to enter into a little Conversation with my two new
Subjects; and first I set Friday to inquire of his Father, what he
thoughtof the Escape of <Ca& Savages in that Canoe, and whether we might
expect a Return of them with a Power too great for us to resist: His
first Opinion was, that the Savages in the Boat never could live out the
Storm which blew that Night they went off, but must of Necessity be
drowned or driven South to those other Shores where they were as
sure to be devoured as they were to be drowned if they were cast
away; but as to what they would do if they came safe on Shore, he
said he knew not; but it was his Opinion that they were so dreadfully
ighted with the Manner of their being attack'd, the Noise and the
Fire, that he believed they would tell their People, they were all
killed by Thunder and Lightning, not by the Hand of Man, and
that the two which appear'd, (viz.) Friday and me, were two Heavenly
Spirits or Furies, come down to destroy them, and not Men with
Weapons: This he said he knew, because he heard them all cry
at so in their Language to one another, for it was impossible to
them to conceive that a Man could dart Fire, and speak Thunder,
and kill at a Distance without lifting up the Hand, as was done now:
And this old Savage was in the right; for, as I understood since by
Other Hands, the Savages never attempted to go over to the Island
afterwards; they were so terrified with the Accounts given by those
four Men, (for it seems they did escape the Sea) that they believ'd
whoever went to that enchanted Island would be destroy'd with Fire
from the Gods.
This however I knew not, and therefore was under continual Ap-
prehensions for a good while, and kept always upon my Guard, me
and all my Army; for as we were now four of us, I would have
ventur'd upon a hundred of them fairly in the open Field at any Time.
In a little Time, however, no more Canoes appearing, the Fear of
their Coming wore off, and I began to take my former Thoughts of a
Voyage to the Main into Consideration, being likewise assur^ by
Friday's Father, that I might depend on good Usage from their
Nation on his Account, if I would go.
«uv\*<s\
117
But my Thoughts were a little suspended, when I had
a serious Discourse with the Spaniard, and when I understood
that there were sixteen more of his Countrymen and Portuguese,
who having been cast away, and made their Escape to that Side,
lived there at Peace indeed with the Savages, but were very sore
put to it for Necessaries, and indeed for Life: I asked him all the
Particulars of their Voyage, and found they were a Spanish Ship
bound from the Rio de la Plata to the Havana, being directed to
leave their Lading there, which was chiefly Hides and Silver, and to
bring back what European Goods they could meet with there; that
they had five Portuguese Seamen on Board, whom they took out of
another Wreck; that five of their own Men were drowned when the
first Ship was lost, and that these escaped through infinite Dangers
and Hazards, and arriv'd almost starved on the Cannibal Coast,
where they expected to have been devour'd every Moment
He told me, they had some Arms with them, but they were perfectly
useless, for that they had neither Powder or Ball, the Washing of the
Sea having spoiled all their Powder but a little, which they used at
their first Landing to provide themselves some Food.
I asked him what he thought would become of them there, and if
they had formed no Design of making any Escape? He said, They
had many Consultations about it, but that having neither Vessel, or
Tools to build one, or Provisions of any kind, their Councils always
ended in Tears and Despair.
I asked him how he thought they would receive a Proposal from
me, which might tend towards an Escape? And whether, if they
were all here, it might not be done? I told him with Freedom, I
feared mostly their Treachery and ill Usage of me, if I put my Life
in their Hands; for that Gratitude was no inherent Virtue in the
Nature of Man; nor did Men always square their Dealings by the
Obligations they had receiv'd, so much as they did by the Advantages
they expected. I told him it would be very hard, that I should be
the Instrument of their Deliverance, and that they should afterwards
make me their Prisoner in New Spain, where an English Man was
certain to be made a Sacrifice, what Necessity, or what Accident
soever, brought him thither: And that I had rather be deliver'd up
to the Savages, and be devour'd alive, than fall into the merciless
Claws of the Priests, and be carry'd into the Inquisition. I added, That
pthirwise I was persuaded, if they were all here, we might, with so many
Hands, build a Bark large enough to carry us allaway,eitherto ihcBrasi/i
Southward, or to the Islands or Spanish Coast Northward: But that
if in Requital they should, when I had put Weapons into their Hands,
carry me by Force among their own People, I might be ill used foi
my Kindness to them, and make my Case worse than it was before.
He answer'd with a great deal of Candour and Ingenuity, That
their Condition was so miserable, and they were so sensible of it, that he
believed they would abhor the Thought of using any Man unkindly
*hat should contribute to their Deliverance; and that, if I pleased,
he would go to them with the old Man, and discourse with them
about it, and return again, and bring me their Answer: That he would
make Conditions with them upon their solemn Oath, That they should
be absolutely under my Leading, as their Commander and Captain;
and that they should swear upon the Holy Sacraments and the Gospel,
to be true to me, and to go to such Christian Country, as that I should
ajjree to, and no other; and to be directed wholly and absolutely by
my Orders, till they were landed safely in such Country, as I intended;
and that he would bring a Contract from them under tiieir Hands
for that Purpose.
Then he told me, he would first swear to me himself, That he
would never stir from me as long as he lived, till I gave him Orders;
and that he would take my Side to the last Drop of his Blood, if there
should happen the least Breach of Faith among his Countrymen.
He told me, they were all of them very civil honest Men, and they
were under the greatest Distress imaginable, having neither Weapons
or Clothes, nor any Food, but at the Mercy and Discretion of the
Savages; out of all Hopes of ever returning to their own Country;
and that he was sure, if I would undertake their Relief, they would
live and die by me.
Upon these Assurances, I resolv'd to venture to relieve them, if
possible, and to send the old Savage and this Spaniard over to them
to treat: But when we had gotten all things in a Readiness to go, the
Spaniard himself started an Objection, which had so much Prudence
in it on one hand, and so much Sincerity on the other hand, that I
could not but be very well satisfy'd in it; and by his Advice, put off
the Deliverance of his Comrades for at least half a Year. The Case
was thus:
He had been with us now about a Month; during which time, I
had let him see in what Manner I had provided, with the Assistance
of Providence, for my Support; and he saw evidently what Stock of
Cor n and Rice I had laid up; which as it was more than sufficient for
myself, so it was not sufficient, at least without good Husbandry, for my
Family; now it was increas'd to Number four: But much less would it
be sufficient, if his Countrymen, who were, as he said, fourteen still alive,
should come over. And least of all should it be sufficient to victual our
Vessel, if we should build one, for a Voyage to any of the Christian
Colonies of America. So he told me, he thought it would be more advis-
able, to let him and the two other, dig and cultivate some more Land, as
much as I could spare Seed to sow; and that we should wait another
Harvest, that we might have a Supply of Corn for his Countrymen
when they should come; for Want might be a Temptation to them to
disagree, or not to think themselves deliver'd, otherwise than out of
one Difficulty into another. You know, says he, the Children of
Israel, though they rejoic'd at first for their being deliver'd out of
Egypt, yet rebell'd even against God himself that deliver'd them,
when they came to want Bread in the Wilderness.
His Caution was so seasonable, and his Advice so good, that I
could not but be very well pleased with his Proposal, as well as 1
was satisfy'd with his Fidelity. So we fell to digging all four of us,
as well as the Wooden Tools we were furnish'd with permitted; and
in about a Month's time, by the End of which it was Seedtime, we
had gotten as much Land cured and trimmed up, as we sowed 22
Bushels of Barley on, and 16 Jars of Rice, which was in short all
the Seed we had to spare; nor indeed did we leave ourselves Barley
sufficient for our own Food, for the six Months that we had to expect
our Crop, that is to say, reckoning from the time we set our Seed
aside for sowing; for it is not to be supposed it is six Months in the
Ground in that Country.
Having now Society enough, and our Number being sufficient
to put us out of Fear of the Savages, if they had come, unless their
Number had been very great, we went freely all over the Island,
wherever we found Occasion; and as here we had our Escape or
Deliverance upon our Thoughts, it was impossible, at least for me,
10 have the Means of it out of mine; to this Purpose, I marked out
several Trees which I thought fit for our Work, and I set Friday and
his Father to cutting them down; and then I caused the Spaniard, to
whom I imparted my Thought on that Affair, to oversee and direct
their Work. I showed them with what indefatigable Pains I had
hewed a large Tree into single Planks, and I caused them to do the
like, till they had made about a Dozen large Planks of good Oak,
near a Foot broad, 35 Foot long, and from a Inches to 4 Inches
thick: What prodigious Labour it took up, any one may imagine.
At the same time I contriv'd to increase my little Flock of tame
Goats as much as I could; and to this Purpose, I made Friday and
the Spaniard go out one Day, and myself with Friday the next
Day; for we took our Turns; and by this Means we got above ao
young Kids to breed up with the rest; for whenever we shot the
Dam, we saved the Kids, and added them to our Flock: But above all,
the Season for curing the Grapes coming on, I caused such a prodigious
Quantity to be hung up in the Sun, that I believe, had we been at
Alicant, where the Raisins of the Sun are cured, we could have filled
60 or 80 Barrels; and these with our Bread was a great Part of our
Food, and very good living too, I assure you; for it is an exceeding
nourishing Food.
It was now Harvest, and our Crop in good Order; it was not the
most plentiful Increase I had seen in the Island, but however it was
enough to answer our End; for from our a a Bushels of Barley, we
brought in and thrashed out above a2o Bushels; and the like in Pro-
portion of the Rice, which was Store enough for our Food to the
next Harvest, though all the 16 Spaniards had been on Shore with
me; or if we had been ready for a Voyage, it would very plentifully
have victualled our Ship, to have carry'd us to any Part of the World,
that is to say, of America.
When we had thus housed and secur'd our Magazine of Corn, we
fell to Work to make more Wicker Work, (viz.) great Baskets in which
we kept it; and the Spaniard was very handy and dexterous at thL«
Part, and often blamed me that I did not make some things, foi
'Defence, of this Kind of Work; but I saw no Need of it
And now having a full Supply of Food for all the Guests I ex-
pected, I gave the Spaniard Leave to go over to the Main, to see
what he could do with those he had left behind him there. I gave
him a strict Charge in Writing, Not to bring any Man with him, who
would not first swear in the Presence of himself and of the old Savage,
That he would no way injure, fight with, or attack the Person h»
should find in the Island, who was so kind to send for them in order
to their Deliverance; but that they would stand by and defend him
against all cuch Attempts, and wherever they went, would be
entirely under and subjected by his Commands; and that this should
be put in Writing, and signed with their Hands: How we were to
have this done, when I knew they had neither Pen or Ink; that in-
deed was a Question which we never asked.
Under these Instructions, the Spaniard, and the old Savage the
Father of Friday, went away in one of the Canoes, which they might
be said to come in, or rather were brought in, when they came as
Prisoners to be devour'd by the Savages.
I gave each of them a Musket with a Firelock on it, and about
eight Charges of Powder and Ball, charging them to be very good
Husbands of both, and not to use either of them but upon urgent
Occasion.
This was a cheerful Work, being the first Measures used by me in
View of my Deliverance for now 27 Years and some Days. I gave
them Provisions of Bread, and of dried Grapes, sufficient for themselves
for many Days, and sufficient for all their Countrymen for about eight
Days' time; and wishing them a good Voyage, I saw them go, agreeing
with them about a Signal they should hang out at their Return, by
which I should know them again, when they came back, at a Distance,
before they came on Shore.
They went away with a fair Gale on the Day that the Moon was at
Full by my Account, in the Month of October: But as for an exact
Reckoning of Days, after I had once lost it, I could never recover it
again; nor had I kept even the Number of Years so punctually, as
to be sure that I was right, though as it proved, when I afterwardi.
examin'd my Account, I found I had kept a true Reckoning of Years.
It was no less than eight Days I had waited for them, when a strange
and unforeseen Accident interven'd, of which the like has not
perhaps been heard of in History: I was fast asleep in my Hutch one
Morning, when my Man Friday came running in to me, and called
aloud, Master, Master, they are come, they are come.
I jumped up, and regardless of Danger, I went out, as soon as I
could get my Clothes on, through my little Grove, which by the Way
was by this time grown to be a very thick Wood; I say, regardless of
Danger, I went without my Arms, which was not my Custom to do:
But I was surpris'd, when turning my Eyes to the Sea, I presently
saw a Boat at about a League and half's Distance, standing in for
the Shore, with a Shoulder of Mutton Sail, as they call it, and the
Wind blowing aretty fair to bring them in; also I observ'd presently,
s
that they did not come from that Side which the Shore lay on, but
from the Southernmost End of the Island: Upon this I called Friday
in, and bid him lie close, for these were not the People we looked
for, and that we might not know yet whether they were Friends or
Enemies.
In the next Place, I went in to fetch my Perspective Glass, to see
what I could make of them; and having taken the Ladder out, I
climbed up to the Top of the Hill, as I used to do when I was appre-
hensive of anything, and to take my View the plainer without being
discover'd.
I had scarce set my Foot on the Hill, when my Eye plainly disco-
ver'd a Ship lying at an Anchor, at about two Leagues and a half's
Distance from me South-south-east, but not above a League and a
half from the Shore. By my Observation it appear'd plainly to be an
English Ship, and the Boat appear'd to be an English Longboat
I cannot express the Confusion I was in, though the Joy of seeing
a Ship, and one who I had Reason to believe was Manned by my own
Countrymen, and consequently Friends, was such as I cannot describe;
but yet I had some secret Doubts hung about me, I cannot tell from
whence they came, bidding me keep upon my Guard. In the first
Place, it occurr'd to me to consider what Business an English Ship
could have in that Part of the World, since it was not the Way to or
from any Part of the World, where the English had any Traffic; and
I knew there had been no Storms to drive them in there, as in Dis-
tress; and that if they were English really, it was most probable that
they were here upon no good Design; and that I had better continue
as I was, than fall into the Hands of Thieves and Murderers.
Let no Man despise the secret Hints and Notices of Danger, which
sometimes are given him, when he may think there is no Possibility
of its being real. That such Hints and Notices are given us, I be-
lieve few that have made any Observations of things, can deny; that
they are certain Discoveries of an invisible World, and a Converse of
Spirits, we cannot doubt; and if the Tendency of them seems to be
to warn us of Danger, why should we not suppose they are from some
friendly Agent, whether supreme, or inferior, and subordinate, is
not the Question; and that they are given for our Good?
The present Question abundantly confirms me in the Justice of
this Reasoning; for had I not been made cautious by this secret
Admonition, come it from whence it will, I had been undone
226
Inevitably, and in a fai worse Condition than before, as you will see
presently.
I had not kept myself long in this Posture, but I saw the Boo*
draw near the Shore, as if they looked for a Creek to thrust in at for
the Convenience of Landing; however, as they did not come quit',
far enough, they did not see the little Inlet where I formerly landed
my Rafts; but run their Boat on Shore upon the Beach, at about
half a Mile from me, which was very happy for me; for otherwise
they would have landed just as I may say at my Door, and would
soon have beaten me out of my Castle, and perhaps have pliinder'd
me of all I had. s
When they were on Shore, I was fully satisfy'd .that they were
English Men; at least, most of them; one or two I thought were

Dutch; but it did nor prove so: There were in all eleven Men,
whereof three of them I found were unarm'd, and as I thought,
bound; and when the first four or five of them were jumped on
Shore, they took those three out of the Boat as Prisoners: One of
the three I could perceive using the most passionate Gestures of En-
treaty, Affliction and Despair, even to a kind of Extravagance; the
other two I could perceive lifted up their Hands sometimes,
and appear'd concern'd indeed, but not to such a Degree as the
first
I was perfectly confounded at the Sight, and knew not wfiat the
Meaning of it should be. Friday called out to me in Enlish, as
well as he could, O Master! You see English Mans eat Prisoner as
as well as Savage Mans. Why, says I, Friday, Do you think they art
ADVENTURES OF
a going to eat them thai? Yes, says Friday, They will eat them: No, no,
says I, Friday, / am afraid they will murder them indeed, but you may
be sure they will not eat them.
All this while I had no thought of what the Matter really was;
but stood trembling with the Horror of the Sight, expecting every Mo-
ment when the three Prisoners should be killed; nay, once I saw one
of the Villains lift up his Arm with a great Cutlass, as the Seamen
call it, or Sword, to strike one of the poor Men; and I expected to
see him fall every Moment, at which all the Blood in my Body
seemed to run chill in my Veins.
I wished heartily now for my Spaniard, and the Savage that was
gone with him; or that I had any way to have come undiscover'd

within shot of them, that I might have rescu'd the three Men; foi
I saw no Fire Arms they had among them; but it fell out to my
Mind another way.
After I had obserVd the outrageous Usage of the three Men, by
the insolent Seamen, I observ'd the Fellows run scattering about the
Land, as if they wanted to see the Country: I observ'd that the three
other Men had Liberty to go also where they pleased; but they sat
down all three upon the Ground, very pensive, and looked like Men
in Despair.
This put me in Mind of the first Time when I came on Shore, and
began to look about me: How I gave myself over for lost: Ho*
wildly I looked round me: What dreadful Apprehensions I had.:
And how I lodged in the Tree all Night for fear of being devour'd
by wild Beasts,
As I knew nothing that Night of the Supply I was to receive bj
the providential Driving of the Ship nearer the Land, by the Storms
aid Tide, by which I have since been so long nourish'd and sup
ported ; so these three poor desolate Men knew nothing how certain o\
Deliverance and Supply they were, how near it was to them, and
how effectually and really they were in a Condition of Safety, at
the same Time that they thought themselves lost, and their Case
desperate.
So little do we see before us in the World, and so much reason
have we to depend cheerfully upon the great Maker of the World,
that he does not leave his Creatures so absolutely destitute, but that in
the worst Circumstances they have always something to be thankful
for, and sometimes are nearer their Deliverance than they imagine;
nay, are even brought to their Deliverance by the Means by which
they seem to be brought to their Destruction.
It was just at the Top of High-Water when these People came on
Shore, and while partly they stood parleying with the Prisoners they
brought, and partly while they rambled about to see what kind of a
Place they were in; they had carelessly stayed till the Tide was spent,
and the Water was ebbed considerably away, leaving their Boat a-
ground.
They had left two Men in the Boat, who as I found afterwards,
having drank a little too much Brandy, fell asleep; however, one of
them waking sooner than the other, and finding the Boat too fast a-
ground for him to stir it, hollow'd for the rest who were straggling
about, upon which they all soon came to the Boat; but it was past all
their Strength to launch her, the Boat being very heavy, and the
Shore on that Side being a soft oozy Sand, almost like a Quick-
sand.
In this Condition, like true Seamen who are perhaps the least of
all Mankind given to forethought, they gave it over, and away they
strolled about the Country again; and I heard one of them say aloud
to another, calling them off from the Boat, Why let her alone, Jack,
can't ye, she will float next Tide; by which I was fully confirm'd in the
main Inquiry, of what Countrymen they were.
All this while I kept myself very close, not once daring to stir out
of my Castle any farther than to my Place of Observation, near the
Top of the Hill; and very glad I was, to think how well it was
fortify'd: I knew it was no less than ten Hours before the Boat could
be on float again, and by that Time it would be dark, and I might be
at more Liberty to see their Motions, and to hear their Discourse, if
!hey had any. v
In the meantime, I fitted myself up for a Battle, as before; though
with more Caution, knowing I had to do with another kind of Enemy
than I had at first: I order'd Friday also, who I had made an excel-
lent Marksman with his Gun, to load himself with Arms: I took
myself two Fowling Pieces, and I gave him three Muskets; my-
Figure indeed was very fierce; I had my formidable Goat-Skin Coat
on, with the great Cap I have mention'd, a naked Sword by my Side,
two Pistols in my Belt, and a Gun upon each Shoulder.
It was my Design, as I said above, not to have made any Attempt
till it was Dark : But about Two o'Clock, being the Heat of the Day,
I found that in short they were all gone straggling into the Woods, and
as I thought were laid down to Sleep. The three poor distressed
Men, too anxious for their Condition to get any Sleep, were however
set down under the Shelter of a great Tree, at about a quarter of a
Mile from me, and as I thought out of sight of any of the rest
Upon this I resolv'd to discover myself to them, and learn some-
thing of their Condition: Immediately I marched in the Figure as
above, my Man Friday at a good Distance behind me, as formidable
for his Arms as I, but not making quite so staring a Spectre-like Figure
as I did.
I came as near them undiscover'd as I could, and then before any
of them saw me, I called aloud to them in Spanish, What are ye
Gentlemen?
They started up at the Noise, but were ten times more confounded
when they saw me, and the uncouth Figure that I- made. They made
no Answer at all, but I thought I perceiv'd them just going to fly from
me, when I spoke to them in English, Gentlemen, said I, do not be sur-
pris'd at me; perhaps you may have a Friend near you when you did
not expect it He must be sent directly from Heaven then, said one oj
them very gravely to me, and pulling off his hat at the same time to
me, for our Condition is past the Help of Man. All Help is from
Heaven, Sir, said I. But can you put a Stranger in the way how to
help you, for you seem to me to be in some great Distress? I saw
you when you landed, and when you 6eemed to make Applications to
the Brutes that came with you, I saw one of them lift up his Sword to
kill you.
The poor Man with Tears, running down his Face, and trembling,
looking like one astonish'd, return'd, Am I talking to God, or Man/
Is it a real Man, or an Angel I Be in no fear about that, Sir, said I,
if God had sent an Angel to relieve you, he would have come better
Clothed, and Armed after another manner than you see me in; pray
lay aside your Fears, I am a Man, an Englishman, and dispos'd to
assist you, you see; I have one Servant only; we have Arms and
Ammunition; tell us freely, Can we serve you?—What is your
Case?
Our Case, said he, Sir, is too long to tell you, while our Murderers
are so near; but in short, Sir, I was Commander of that Ship, my
Men have Mutinied against me; they have been hardly prevail'd on
not to Murder me, and at last have set me on Shore in this desolate
Place, with these two Men with me; one my Mate, the other a
Passenger, where we expected to Perish, believing the Place to be
uninhabited, and know not yet what to think of it
Where are those Brutes, your Enemies, said I, do you know where
they are gone? There they lie, Sir, said he, pointing to a Thicket of
Trees; my Heart trembles, for fear they have seen us, and heard you
speak, if they have, they will certainly Murder us all.
Have they any Fire-Arms, said I, He answered they had only two
Pieces, and one which they left in the Boat Well then, said I, leave
the rest to me; I see they are all asleep, it is an easy thing to kill
them all; but shall we rather take them Prisoners? He told me
there were two desperate Villains among them, that it was scarce safe
to show any Mercy to; but if they were secur'd, he believ'd all the
rest would return to their Duty. I asked him, which they were?
He told me he could not at that distance describe them; but he would
obey my Orders in anything I would direct Well, says I, let us retreat
out of their View or Hearing, lest they awake, and we will resolve
further; so they willingly went back with me, till the Woods cover'd
us from them.
Look you, Sir, said I, if I venture upon your Deliverance, are you
willing to make two Conditions with me; he anticipated my Pro-
posals, by telling me, that both he and the Ship, if recover'd, should
be wholly Directed and Commanded by me in everything; and if the
Ship was not recover'd, he would live and die with me in what Part
of the World soever I would send him; and the two other Men said
the same.
Well, says I, my Conditions are but two. I. That while you stay
on this Island with me, you will not pretend to any Authority here;
and if I put Arms into your Hands, you will upon all Occasions give
them up to me, and do no Prejudice to me or mine, upon this Island,
and in the meantime be govern'd by my Orders.
i. That if the Ship is, or may be recover'd, you will carry me and
my Man to England Passage free.
He gave me all the Assurances that the Invention and Faith of
Man could devise, that he would comply with these most reasonable
Demands, and besides would owe his Life to me, and acknowledge it
upon all Occasions as long as he lived.
Well then, said I, here are three Muskets for you, with Powder and
Ball; tell me next what you think is proper to be done. He showed
all the Testimony of his Gratitude that he was able; but offer'd to
be wholly guided by me. I told him I thought it was hard venturing
anything; but the best Method I could think of was to fire upon
them at once, as they lay; and if any was not killed at the first
Volley, and offered to submit, we might save them, and so put it
wholly upon God's Providence to direct the shot
He said very modestly, that he was loth to kill them, if he could
help it, but that those two were incorrigible Villains, and had been
the Authors of all the Mutiny in the Ship, and if they escaped, we
should be all undone still; for they would go on Board, and bring
the whole Ship's Company, and destroy us all. Well then, says I,
Necessity legitimates my Advice; for it is the only Way to save our
Lives. However, seeing him still cautious of shedding Blood, I
told him they should go themselves, and manage as they found con-
venient
In the Middle of this Discourse, we heard some of them awake,
and soon after, we saw two of them on their Feet, I asked him, if
either of them were of the Men who he had said were the Heads of
the Mutiny? He said, No; Well then, said I, you may let them es-
cape, and Providence seems to have waken'd them on Purpose to
save themselves. Now, says I, if the rest escape you, it is your
Fault
Animated with this, he took the Musket, I had given him, in his
Hand, and a Pistol in his Belt, and his two Comrades with him, with
each Man a Piece in his Hand . The two Men who were with him,
going first, macv some Noise, at which one of the Seamen who was
awake, turned about, and seeing them coming, cried out to the rest;
tyit it was too late then; for the Moment he cried out, they fired;
/ mean the two Men, the Captain wisely reserving his own Piece:
They had so well aimed their Shot at the Men they knew, that one
of them was killed on the Spot, and the other very much wounded;
but not being dead, he started up upon his Feet, and called eagerly
for help to the other; but the Captain stepping to him, told him, it
was too late to cry for help, he should call upon God to forgive his
Villany, and with that Word knocked him down with the Stock of
his Musket, so that he never spoke more: There were three more in
the Company, and one of them was also slightly wounded: By this
Time I was come, and when they saw their Danger, and that it was
in vain to resist, they begged for Mercy: The Captain told them, he
would spare their Lives, if they would give him any Assurance of
their Abhorrence of the Treachery they had been guilty of, and would
swear to be faithful to him in recovering the Ship, and afterwards in
carrying her back to Jamaica, from whence they came: They gave
him all the Protestations of their Sincerity that could be desir'd, and
he was willing to believe them, and spare their Lives, which I was
not against, only that I oblig'd him to keep them bound Hand and
Foot while they were upon the Island.
While this was doing, I sent Friday with the Captain'3 Mate to
the Boat, with Orders to secure her, and bring away the Oars, and
Sail, which they did; and by and by, three straggling Men that were
(happily for them) parted from the rest, came back upon hearing the
Guns fired, and seeing their Captain, who before was their Prisoner,
now their Conqueror, they submitted to be bound also; and so our
Victory was complete.
It now remain'd, that the Captain and I should inquire into one
another's Circumstances: I began first, and told him my whole
History, which he heard with an Attention even to Amazement; and
particularly, at the wonderful Manner of my being furnish'd with
Provisions and Ammunition; and indeed, as my Story is a whole
Collection of Wonders, it affected him deeply; but when he reflected
from thence upon himself, and how I seemed to have been preserv'd
there, on purpose to save his Life, the Tears ran down his Pace, and
he could not sneak a Word more
After this Communication was at an End, I carryM hina and h!s
two Men into my Apartment, leading them in, just where I came
out, viz. At the Top of the House, where I refresh'd them with such
Provisions as I had, and showed them all the Contrivances I had
made, during my long, long inhabiting that Place.
All I showed them, all I said to them, was perfectly amazing; but
above all, the Captain admir'd my Fortification, and how perfectly 1
had conceal'd my Retreat with a Grove of Trees, which having been
now planted near twenty Years, and the Trees growing much faster
than in England, was become a little Wood, and so thick, that it was
unpassable in any Part of it, but at that one Side, where I had reserv'd
my little winding Passage into it: I told him, this was my Castle,
and my Residence; but that I had a Seat in the Country, as most
Princes have, whither I could retreat upon Occasion, and I would
show him that too another Time; but at present, our Business was
to consider how to recover the Ship: He agreed with me as to that;
but told me, he was perfectly at a Loss what Measures to take; for
that there were still six-and-twenty Hands on board, who having
enter'd into a cuTsed Conspiracy, by which they had all forfeited their
Lives to the Law, would be harden'd in it now by Desperation; and
would carry it on, knowing that if they were reduc'd, they should be
brought to the Gallows, as soon as they came to England, or to any of
the English Colonies; and that therefore there would be no attack-
ing them, with so small a Number as we were.
I mused for some Time upon what he had said, and found it was a
very rational Conclusion; and that therefore something was to be
resolv'd on very speedily, as well to draw the Men on board into
some Snare for their Surprise, as to prevent their Landing upon us,
and destroying us; upon this it presently occurr'd to me, that in a
little while the Ship's Crew wondering what was become of their
Comrades, and of the Boat, would certainly come on Shore in their
other Boat, to see for them, and that then perhaps they might come
armed, and be too strong for us; this he allow'd was rational.
Upon this, I told him the first Thing we had to do, was to stave
the Boat, which lay upon the Beach, so that they might not carry
her off; and taking everything out of her, leave her so far useless as
r»ot to be fit to swim; accordingly we went on board, took the
Arms which were left on board, out of her, and whatever else we
found there, which was a Bottle of Brandy, and another of Rum, a few
Biscuit Cakes, a Horn of Powder, and a great Lump of Sugar, in a
Piece of Canvas; the Sugar was five or six Pounds, all which was
very welcome to me, especially the Brandy, and Sugar, of which I
had none left for many Years.
When we had carry'd all these Things on Shore (the Oars, Mast,
Sail, and Rudder of the Boat, were carry'd away before, as above)
we knocked a great Hole in her Bottom, that if they had come
strong enough to master us, yet they could not carry off the
Boat
Indeed, it was not much in my Thoughts, that we could be able to
recover the Ship; but my View was that if they went away without
the Boat, I did not much question to make her fit again, to carry us
away to the Leeward Islands, and call upon our Friends, the
Spaniards, in my way, for I had them still in my Thoughts.
While we were thus preparing our Designs, and had first, by main
Strength heaved the Boat up upon the Beach, so high that the Tide
would not float her off at High-Water-Mark; and besides, had broke
a Hole in her Bottom, too big to be quickly stopped, and were sat
down musing what we should do; we heard the Ship fire a Gun, and
saw her make a Waft with her Ancient, as a Signal for the Boat to
come on board; but no Boat stirred; and they fired several Times,
making other Signals for the Boat
At last, when all their Signals and Firings proved fruitless, and
they found the Boat did not stir, we saw them by the Help of my
Glasses, hoist another Boat out, and row towards the Shore; and we
found as they approach'd, that there were no less than ten Men in
her, and that they had Firearms with them.
As the Ship lay almost two Leagues from the Shore, we had a full
View of them as they came, and a plain Sight of the Men even of
their Faces, because the Tide having set them a little to" the East
of the other Boat, they rowed up under Shore, to come to
the same Place, where the other had landed, and where the Boat
lay.
By this Means, I say, we had a full View of them, and the Captain
knew the Persons and Characters of all the Men in the Boat, of whcm
he said, that there were three very honest Fellows, who he was sure
were led into this Conspiracy by the rest, being overpower'd and
frighted.
But that as for the Boatswain, who it seems was the chief Officer
among them, and all the rest, they were as outrageous as any of the
Ship's Crew, and were no doubt made desperate in their new Enter
prise, and terribly apprehensive he was, that they would be too
powerful for us.
I smiled at him, and told him, that Men in our Circumstances were
past the Operation of Fear: That seeing almost every Condition that
could be, was better than that which we were suppos'd to be in, we
ought to expect that the Consequence, whether Death or Life, would
be sure to be a Deliverance: I asked him, What he thought of the
Circumstances of my Life? And, Whether a Deliverance were not
worth venturing for? And where, Sir, said I, is your Belief of my
being preserv'd here on purpose to save your Life, which elevated you
a little while ago? For my Part, said I, there seems to be but one
Thing amiss in all the Prospect of it; Whafs that? Says he; why,
said I, it is, that as you say, there are three or four honest Fellows
among them, which should be spared; had they been all of the wicked
Part of the Crew, I should have thought God's Providence had singled
them out to deliver them into your Hands; for depend upon it, every
Man of them that comes a-shore are our own, and shall die, or live, as
they behave to us.
As I spoke this with a raised Voice and cheerful Countenance, I
found it greatly encourag'd him; so we set vigorously to our Business:
We had upon the first Appearance of the Boat's coming from the Ship,
consider'd of separating our Prisoners, and had indeed secur'd them
effectually.
Two of them, of whom the Captain was less assur'd than ordinary,
I sent with Friday, and one of the three (deliver'd Men) to my Cave,
where they were remote enough, and out of Danger of being heard or
discover'd, or of finding their way out of the Woods, if they could
have deliver'd themselves: Here they left them bound, but gave them
Provisions, and promis'd them if they continu'd there quietly, to give
them their Liberty in a Day or two; but that if they attempted their
Escape, they should be put to Death without Mercy: They promis'd
faithfully to bear their Confinement with Patience, and were very
thankful that they had such good Usage, as to have Provisions, and a
Light left them; for Friday gave them Candles (such as we made
ourselves) for their Comfort; and they did not know but that he stood
Sentinel over them at the Entrance.
The other Prisoners had better Usage; two of them were kept
*S3
pinion'd indeed, because the Captain was not free to trust them; but
the other two were taken into my Service upon their Captain's Recom-
mendation, and upon their solemnly engaging to live and die with us; so
with them and the three honest Men, we were seven Men, well armed;
and I made no doubt we should be able to deal well enough with the
Ten that were a coming, considering that the Captain had said, there
were three or four honest Men among them also.
As soon as they got to the Place where their other Boat lay, they
run their Boat into the Beach, and came all on Shore, hauling the
Boat up after them, which I was glad to see; for I was afraid they
would rather have left the Boat at an Anchor, some Distance from the
Shore, with some Hands in her, to guard her; and so we should not
be able to seize the Boat

Being on Shore, the first Thing they did, they ran all to their other
Boat, and it was easy to see that they were under a great Surprise, to
find her stripped as above, of all that was in her, and a great hole in
her Bottom.
After they had mused a while upon this, they set up two or three
great Shouts, hollowing with all their might, to try if they could make
their Companions hear; but all was to no purpose: Then they came
all close in a Ring, and fired a Volley of their small Arms, which
indeed we heard, and the Echoes made the Woods ring; but it was
all one, those in the Cave we were sure could not hear, and those in
our keeping, though they heard it well enough, yet durst give no
Answer to them.
They were so astonish'd at the Surprise of this, that as they told us
afterwards, they resolv'd to go all on board again to their Ship, and
•J4
ADVENTURES OF
let them know that the Men were all murder'd, and the Long-Boat
staved; accordingly they immediately launched their Boat again and
gat all of them on board.
The Captain was terribly amaz'd, and even confounded at this,
believing they would go on board the Ship again, and set Sail, giving
their Comrades for lost, and so he should still lose the Ship, which
he was in Hopes we should have recover'd; but he was quickly as
much frighted the other way.
They had not been long put off with the Boat, but we perceiv'd
them all coming on Shore again; but with this new Measure in their
Conduct, which it seems they consulted together upon, viz. To leave
three Men in the Boat, and the rest go on Shore, and go up into the
Country to look for their FellGws.
This was a great Disappointment to us; for now we were at a Loss
what to do; for our seizing those seven Men on Shore would be no Ad-

vantage to us, if we let the Boat escape ; because they would then rcw
away to the Ship, and then the rest of them would be sure to weigh
and set Sail, and so our recovering the Ship would be lost
However, we had no Remedy, but to wait and see what the Issue
of Things might present; the seven Men came on Shore, and the
three who remain'd in the Boat, put her off to a good Distance from
the Shore, and came to an Anchor to wait for them; so that it waC
impossible for us to come at them in the Boat
Those that came on Shore, kept close together, marching toward*
the Top of the little Hill, under which my Habitation lay; and w«
could see them plainly, though they could not perceive us: We coula
have been very glad they would have come nearer to us, so that we
*3S
might have fired at them, or that they would have gone father off,
that we might have come abroad.
But when they were come to the Brow of the Hill, where they could
see a great way into the Valleys and Woods, which lay towards the
North-East Part, and where the Island lay lowest, they shouted, and
hollow'd, till they were weary; and not caring it seems to venture
far from the Shore, nor far from one another, they sat down together
under a Tree, to consider of it: Had they thought fit to have gone
to sleep there, as the other Party of them had done, they had done
the Job for us: but they were too full of Apprehensions of Danger, to
venture to go to sleep, though they could not tell what the Danger was
they had to fear neither.
The Captain made a very just Proposal to me, upon this Consulta-
tion of theirs, viz. That perhaps they would all fire a Volley again, to
endeavour to make their Fellows hear, and that we should all Sally
upon them, just at the Juncture when their Pieces were all discharg'd,
and they would certainly yield, and we should have them without
Bloodshed: I liked the Proposal, provided it was done while we
were near enough to come up to them, before they could load their
Pieces again.
But this Event did not happen, and we lay still a long Time, very
irresolute what Course to take; at length I told them, there would be
nothing to be done in my Opinion till Night, and then if they did not
return to the Boat, perhaps we might find a way to get between them,
and the Shore, and so might use some Stratagem with them in the
Boat, to get them on Shore.
We waited a great while, though very impatient for their removing;
and were very uneasy, when after long Consultations, we saw them
start all up, and march down toward the Sea: It seems they had such
dreadful Apprehensions upon them, of the Danger of the Place, that
they resolv'd to go on board the Ship again, give their Companions
over for lost, and so go on with their intended Voyage with the
Ship.
As soon as I perceiv'd them go towards the Shore, I imagin'd it to
be as it really was, That they had given over their Search, and were
for going back again; and the Captain, as soon as I told him my
Thoughts, was ready to sink at the Apprehensions of it; but 1
presently thought of a Stratagem to fetch them back again, and whick
•nswer'd my End to a Tittle.
I order"d Friday, and the Captain's Mate, to go over the little
Creek Westward, towards the Place where the Savages came on
Shore, when Friday was rescu'd; and as soon as they came to a
little rising Ground, at about half a Mile Distance, I bade them hol-
low, as loud as they could, and wait till they found the Seamen
heard them; that as soon as ever they heard the Seamen answer
them, they should return it again, and then keeping out of Sight,
take a round, always answering when the other hollow'd, to draw them
as far into the Island, and among the Woods, as possible, and then
wheel about again to me, by such ways as I directed them.
They were just going into the Boat, when Friday and the Mate
hollow'd, and they presently heard them, and answering, run along
the Shore Westward, towards the Voice they heard, when they were
presently stopped by the Creek, where the Water being up, they
could not get over, and called for the Boat to come up, and set them
over, as indeed I expected.
When they had set themselves over, I observ'd, that the Boat being
gone up a good way into the Creek, and as it were, in a Harbour
within the Land, they took one of the three Men out of her to go
along with them, and left only two in the Boat, having fastened her to
the Stump of a little Tree on the Shore.
This was what I wished for, and immediately leaving Friday and
the Captain's Mate to their Business, I took the rest with me, and
crossing the Creek out of their Sight, we surpris'd the two Men before
they were aware; one of them lying on Shore, and the other being in
the Boat; the Fellow on Shore, was between sleeping and waking,
and going to start up, the Captain who was foremost, ran in upon
him, and knocked him down, and then called out to him in the Boat,
to yield, or he was a dead Man.
There needed very few Arguments to persuade a single Man to
yield, when he saw five Men upon him, and his Comrade knocked
down; besides, this was it seems one of the three who were not so
hearty in the Mutiny as the rest of the Crew, and therefore was easily
persuaded, not only to yield, but afterwards to join very sincere
with us.
In the meantime, Friday and the Captain's Mate so well manag'd
their Business with the rest, that they drew them by hollowing and
answering, from one Hill to another; and from one Wood to another,
till they not only heartily tired them, but l«ft them, where they were
very sure they could not reach back to the Boat, before it was dark;
and indeed they were heartily tired themselves also by the Time they
came back to us.
We had nothing now to do, but to watch for them, in the Dark, and
fall upon them, so as to make sure work with them.
It was several Hours after Friday came back to me, before they
came back to their Boat; and we could hear the foremost of them
long before they came quite up, calling to those behind to come
along, and could also hear them answer and complain, how lame and
tired they were, and not able to come any faster, wuich was very
Welcome News to us.
At length they came up to the Boat; But it is impossible to
express their Confusion, when they found the Boat fast aground in
the Creek, the Tide ebbed out, and their two Men gone: We could
hear them call to one another in a most lamentable Manner, telling
one another, they were gotten into an enchanted Island; that either
there were Inhabitants in it, and they should all be murder'd, or else
there were Devils and Spirits in it, and they should be all carry'd
away, and devour'd.
They hallow'd again, and called their two Comrades by their Names,
a great many times, but no Answer. After some time, we could see
them, by the little Light there was, run about wringing their Hands
like Men in Despair; and that sometimes they would go and sit down
in the Boat to rest themselves, then come ashore again, and walk
about again, and so over the same thing again.
My Men would fain have me given them Leave to fall upon them at
once in the Dark; but I was willing to take them at some Advantage,
so to spare them, and kill as few of them as I could; and especially
I was unwilling to hazard the killing any of our own Men, knowing
the other were very well armed. I resolved to wait to see if they did
not separate; and therefore to make sure of them, I drew my Ambus-
cade nearer, and order'd Friday and the Captain, to creep upon their
Hands and Feet as close to the Ground as they could, that they
might not be discover'd, and get as near them as they could possibly,
before they offered to fire.
They had not been long in that Posture, but that the Boatswain,
who was the principal Ringleader of the Mutiny, and had now shown
himself the most dejected and dispirited of all the rest, came walking
towards them with two more of their Crew: the Captain was so eager,
as having this principal Rogue so much in his Power, that he could
hardly have Patience to let him come so near, as to be sure of
him; for they only heard his Tongue before: But when they came
aearer, the Captain and Friday starting up on their Feet, let fly at
them.
The Boatswain was killed upon the Spot, the next Man was shot
into the Body, and fell just by him, though he did not die till an Hour
or two after; and the third run for it
At the Noise of the Fire, I immediately advanc'd with my whole
Army, which was now 8 Men, viz. myself Generalissimo, Friday my
Lieutenant-General, the Captain and his two Men, and the three
Prisoners of War, whom we had trusted with Arms.
We came upon them indeed in the Dark, so that they could not see
our Number; and I made the Man we had left in the Boat, who was
now one of us, call to them by Name, to try if I could bring them to
a Parley, and so might perhaps reduce them to Terms, which fell oui
just as we desir'd: For indeed it was easy to think, as their Condi-
tion then was, they would be very willing to capitulate; so he calls
out as loud as he could, to one of them, Tom Smith, Tom Smith;
Tom Smith answered immediately, Who's that, Robinson ? for it seems
he knew his Voice : The other answered Ay, ay; for God's sake, Tom
Smith, throw down your Arms, and yield, or you are all dead Men this
Moment.
Who must we yield to? where are they? (says Smith again;) Here
they are, says he, here's our Captain, and fifty Men with him, have
been hunting you this two Hours; the Boatswain is killed, WillFrye
is wounded, and I am a Prisoner; and if you do not yield, you are
all lost
Will they give us Quarter then, (says Tom Smith) and we will yield?
I'll go and ask, if you promise to yield, says Robinson; so he asked the
Captain, and the Captain then calls himself out, You Smith, you know
my Voice, if you lay down your Arms immediately, and submit, you
shall have your Lives all but Will. Atkins.
Upon this, Will. Atkins cried out, For God's sake, Captain, give me
Quarter, what have I done? They have been all as bad as I, which by
the Way was not true neither; for it seems this Will. Atkins was the
first Man that laid hold of the Captain, when they first mutiny'd, and
nsed him barbarously, in tying his Hands, and giving him injurious
Language. However, the Captain told him he must lay down his
Arms at Discretion, and trust to the Governor's Mercy, by which he
meant me; for they all called me Governor.
In a Word, they all laid down their Arms, and begged their Lives;
and I sent the Man that had parley'd with them, and two more, who
bound them all; and then my Great Army of 50 Men, which particu-
larly with those three, were all but eight, came up and seized upon
them all, and upon their Boat, only that I kept myself and one more
1 out of Sight, for Reasons of staet
Our next Work was to repair the Boat, and think of seizing the
Ship; and as for the Captain, now he had Leisure to parley with them:
He expostulated with them upon the Villany of their Practices with
him, and at length upon the farther Wickedness of their Design, and
how certainly it must bring them to Misery and Distress in the End,
and perhaps to the Gallows.
They all appear'd very penitent, and begg'd hard for their Lives;
as for that, he told them, they were none of his Prisoners, but the
Commander of the Island, that they thought they had set him on
Shore in a barren uninhabited Island, but it had pleased God so to
direct them, that the Island was inhabited, and that the Governor was
an English Man; that He might hang them all there, if he
pleased; but as he had given them all Quarter, he supposed he would
send them to England to be dealt with there, as Justice requir'd, except
Atkins, who he was commanded by the Governor to advise to prepare
for Death; for that he would be hang'd in the Morning.
Though this was all a Fiction of his own, yet it had its desired
Effect; Atkins fell upon his Knees to beg the Captain to intercede
with the Governor for his Life; and all the rest begged of him for
God's sake, that they might not be sent to England.
It now occurr'd to me that the time of our Deliverance was come,
and that it would be a most easy thing to bring these Fellows in, to
be hearty in getting Possession of the Ship; so I retir'd in the Dark
from them, that they might not see what Kind of a Governor they had,
and called the Captain to me; when I called, as at a good Distance,
one of the Men was order'd to speak again, and say to the Captain,
Captain, the Commander calls for you; and presently the Captain reply'd,
Tell his Excellency, I am just a coming: This more perfectly amused
them; and they all believed that the Commander was just by witli his
fifty Men.
Upon the Captain's coming to me, I told him my Project for seiz-
ing the Ship, which he liked of wonderfully well, and resolv'd to put
u in Execution the next Morning.
But in Order to execute it with more Art, and secure of Success, ]
bid him, we must divide the Prisoners, and that he should go and
take Atkins and two more of the worst of them, and send them pin-
ion'd to the Cave where the others lay: This was committed to
Friday and the two Men who came on Shore with the Captain.
They convey'd them to the Cave, as to a Prison; and it was indeed
a dismal Place, especially to Men in their Condition.
The other I order'd to my Bower, as I called it, of which I have
given a full Description; and as it was fenced in, and they pinion'd, the
Place was secure enough, considering th; were upon their Behaviour
To these in the Morning I sent the Captain, who was to enter into
a Parley with them, in a Word io try them, and tell me, whether he
thought they might be trusted or no, to go on Board and surprise the
Ship. He talked to them of the Injury done him, of the Condition
they were brought to; and that though the Governor had given them
Quarter for their Lives, as to the present Action, yet that if they were
sent to England, they would all be hanged in Chains, to be sure; but
that if they would join in so just an Attempt, as to recover the Ship,
he would have the Governor's Engagement for their Pardon.
Any one may guess how readily such a Proposal would be accepted
by Men in their Condition; they fell down on their Knees to the
Captain, and promised with the deepest Imprecations, that they would
be faithful to him to the last Drop, and that they should owe their
Lives to him, and would go with him all over the World, that they
would own him for a Father to them as long as they lived.
Well, says the Captain, I must go and tell the Governor what you
say, and see what I can do to bring him to consent to it: So he
brought me an Account of the Temper he found them in; and that
he verily believ'd they would be faithful.
However, that we might be very secure, I told him he should go
back again, and choose out those five, and tell them, they might see
that he did not want Men, that he would take out those five to be
his Assistants, and that the Governor would keep the other two,
and the three that were sent Prisoners to the Castle, (my Cave) as
Hostages, for the Fidelity of those five; and that if they proved un-
faithful in the Execution, the five Hostages should be hanged in
Chains alive upon the Shore.
This looked severe, and convinc'd them that the Governor was ia
Earnest; however they had no Way left them, but to accept it; and
it was now the Business of the Prisoners, as much as of the Captain,
to persuade the other five to do their Duty.
Our Strength was now thus ordered for the Expedition: i. The
Captain, his Mate, and Passenger, a. Then the two Prisonels of the
first Gang, to whom having their Characters from the Captain, I had
given their Liberty, and trusted them with Arms. 3. The other two
whom I had kept till now, in my Bower, pinion'd; but upon the
Captain's Motion, had now releas'd. 4. These five releas'd at last:
So that they were twelve in all, besides five we kept Prisoners in the
Cave, for Hostages.
I asked the Captain, if he was willing to venture with these Hands
on Board the Ship; for as for me and my Man Friday, I did not
think it was proper for us to stir, having seven Men left behind;
and it was Employment enough for us to keep them asunder, and
supply them with Victuals.
As to the five in the Cave, I resolv'd to keep them fast, but Friday
went in twice a Day to them, to supply them with Necessaries; and
I made the other two carry Provisions to a certain Distance, where
Friday was to take it
When I showed myself to the two Hostages, it was with the Cap-
tain, who told them, I was the Person the Governor had order'd to
look after them, and that it was the Governor's Pleasure they should
not stir anywhere, but by my Direction; that if they did, they should
be fetched into the Castle, and be laid in Irons; so that as we never
suffered them to see me as Governor, so I now appear'd as another
Person, and spoke of the Governor, the Garrison, the Castle, and the
like, upon all Occasions.
The Captain now had no Difficulty before him, but to furnish his
two Boats, stop the Breach of one, and Man them. He made his
Passenger Captain of one, with four other Men; and himself, and his
Mate, and five more, went in the other: And they contriv'd then-
Business very well; for they came up to the Ship about Mid-
night: As soon as they came within Call of the Ship, he made
Robinson hail them, and tell them they had brought off the Men and
the Boat, but that it was a long time before they had found them,
and the like; holding them in a Chat till they came to the Ship's
Side; when the Captain and the Mate entering first with their Arms,
immediately knocked down the second Mate and Carpenter, with
the Butt-end of their Muskets, being very faithfully seconded by their
Men, they secur'd all the rest that were upon the Main and Quarter
Decks, and began to fasten the Hatches to keep them down who
were below, when the other Boat and their Men entering at the fore
Chains, secur'd the Forecastle of the Ship, and the Scuttle which
went down into the Cook-Room, making three Men they found there,
Prisoners.
When this was done, and all safe upon Deck, the Captain order'd
the Mate with three Men to break into the Round-House where the
new Rebel Captain lay, and having taken the Alarm, was gotten up,
and with two Men and a Boy had gotten Fire Arms in their Hands,
and when the Mate with a Crow split open the Door, the new Cap-
tain and his Men fired boldly among them, and wounded the Mate
with a Musket Ball, which broke his Arm, and wounded two more
of the Men but killed nobody.
The Mate calling for Help, rushed however into the Round-House,
wounded as he was, and with his Pistol shot the new Captain through
the Head, the Bullet entering at his Mouth, and came out again be-
hind one of his Ears; so that he never spoke a Word; upon which
the rest yielded, and the Ship was taken effectually, without any
more Lives lost
As soon as the Ship was thus secur'd, the Captain order'd seven
Guns to be fired, which was the Signal agreed upon with me, to give
me Notice of his Success, which you may be sure I was very glad to
hear, having sat watching upon the Shore for it till near two o'clock
in the Morning.
Having thus heard the Signal plainly, I laid me down; and it
having been a Day of great Fatigue to me, I slept very sound, till I
was something surpris'd with the Noise of a Gun; and presently
starting up, I heard a Man call me by the Name of Governor, and
presently I knew the Captain's Voice, when climbing up to the Top
of the Hill, there he stood, and pointing to the Ship, he embrac'd
me in his Arms, My dear Friend and Deliverer, says he, therisyottr
Ship, for she is all yours, and so are we and all that belong to her. I
cast my Eyes to the Ship, and there she rode within little more than
half a Mile of the Shore; for they had weighed her Anchor as soon
as they were Masters of her; and the Weather being fair, had brought
her to an Anchor just against the Mouth of the little Creek; and the
Tide being up, the Captain had brought the Pinnace in near the
Place where I at first landed my Rafts, and so landed just at my
Door.
I was at first ready to sink down with the Surprise. For I saw my
Deliverance indeed visibly put into my Hands, all things easy, and
a large Ship just ready to carry me away whither I pleased to go.
At first, for some time, I was not able to answer him one Word; but
as he had taken me in his Arms, I held fast by him, or I should
have fallen to the Ground.
He perceived the Surprise, and immediately pulls a Bottle out of
his Pocket, and gave me a Dram of Cordial, which he had brought
on Purpose for me; after I had drank it, 1 sat down upon the
Ground; and though it brought me to myself, yet it was a good
while before I could speak a Word to him.
All this while the poor Man was in as great an Ecstasy as I, only
not under any Surprise, as I was; and he said a thousand kind tender
things to me, to compose me and bring me to myself; but such was
the Flood of Joy in my Breast, that it put all my Spirits into Con-
tusion, at last it broke out into Tears, and in a little while after, I
recovered my Speech.
Then I took my Turn, and embrac'd him as my Deliverer; and
we rejoic'd together. I told him, I looked upon him as a Man sent
fromHeavento deliver me, and thatthewhole Transaction seemed to be
a Chain of Wonders; that such things as these were the Testimonies
we had of a secret Hand of Providence governing the World, and an
Evidence, that the Eyes of an infinite Power could search into the
remotest Corner of the World, and send Help to the Miserable when-
ever he pleased.
I forgot not to lift up my Heart in Thankfulness to Heaven, and
what Heart could forbear to bless him, who had not only in a
miraculous Manner provided for one in such a Wilderness, and in
such a desolate Condition, but from whom every Deliverance must
always be acknowledged to proceed.
When we had talked a while, the Captain told me, he had brought
me some little Refreshment, such as the Ship afforded, and such as
the Wretches that had been so long his Masters had not plunder'd
him of: Upon this he called aloud to the Boat, and bid his Men
bring the things ashore that were for the Governor; and indeed it
was a Present, as if I had been one not that was to be carry'd away
ADVENTURES OF
along with them, but as if I had been to dwell upon the Island still,
and they were to go without me.
First he had brought me a Case of Bottles full of excellent Cordial
Waters, six large Bottles of Madeira Wine; the Bottles held two
Quarts apiece; two Pound of excellent good Tobacco, twelve good
Pieces of the Ship's Beef, and six Pieces of Pork, with a Bag of
Pease, and about a hundred Weight of Biscuit
He brought me also a Box of Sugar, a Box of Flour, a Bag full of
Lemons, and two Bottles of Lime-juice, and Abundance of other
things: But besides these, and what was a thousand times more
useful to me, he brought me six clean new Shirts, six very good
Neckcloths, two Pair of Gloves, one Pair of Shoes, a Hat, and one
Pair of Stockings, and a very good Suit of Clothes of his own, which
had been worn but very little: In a Word, he clothed me from Head
to Foot
It was a very kind and agreeable Present, as any one may imagine,
to one in my Circumstances: But never was anything in the World
of that Kind so unpleasant, awkward, and uneasy, as it was to me to
wear such Clothes at their first putting on.
Aftei tfiese Ceremonies past, and after all his good things were
brought 'Oto my little Apartment, we began to consult what was to
be done with the Prisoners we had; for it was worth considering
whether we might venture to take them away with us or no, especially
two of them, who we knew to be incorrigible and refractory to the
last Degree; and the Captain said, he knew tiiey were such Rogues,
that there was no obliging them, and if he did cany them away, it
must be in Irons, as Malefactors to be delivered over to Justice at
the first English Colony he could come at; and I found that the
Captain himself was very anxious about it
Upon this, I told him, that if he desir^ it, I durst undertake to
bring the two Men he spoke of, to make it their own Request that
he should leave them upon the Island: / should be very glad of that,
says the Captain, with all my Heart.
Well, says I, I will send for them up, and talk with them for you;
so I caused Friday and the two Hostages, for they were now dis-
charg'd, their Comrades having perform'd their Promise; I say, I
caused them to go to the Cave, and bring up the five Men pinion'd,
as they were, to the Bower, and keep them there till I came.
After some time, I came thither dressed in my new Habit, and
now I was called Governor again; being all met, and the Captain
with me, I caused the Men to be brought before me, and I told them,
I had had a full Account of their villanous Behaviour to the Captain,
and how they had run away with the Ship, and were preparing to
commit farther Robberies, but that Providence had ensnar'd them in
their own Ways, and that they were fallen into the Pit which they
had digged for others.
I let them know, that by my Direction the Ship had been seized,
that she lay now in the Road; and they might see by and by, that
their new Captain had receiv'd the Reward of his Villany; for that
they might see him hanging at the Yard-arm.
That as to them, I wanted to know what they had to say, why I
should not execute them as Pirates taken in the Fact, as by my Com-
mission they could not doubt I had Authority to do.
One of them answer'd in the Name of the rest, That they had
nothing to say but this, That when they were taken, the Captain
promis'd them their Lives, and they humbly implor'd my Mercy;
But I told them, I knew not what Mercy to show them; for as for
myself, I had resolv'd to quit the Island with all my Men, and had
taken Passage with the Captain to go for England: And as for the
Captain, he could not carry them to England, other than as Prisoners
in Irons to be tried for Mutiny, and running away with the Ship; the
Consequence of which, they must needs know, would be the Gallows;
so that I could not tell which was best for them, unless they had a
Mind to take their Fate in the Island; if they desir'd, that I did not
care, as I had Liberty to leave it, I had some Inclination to give
them their Lives, if they thought they could shift on Shore.
They seemed very thankful for it, said they would much rather
venture to stay there, than to be cany'd to England to be hanged ,
so I left it on that Issue.
However, the Captain seemed to make some Difficulty of it, as if
he durst not leave them there: Upon this I seemed a little angry
with the Captain, and told him, That they were my Prisoners, not
his; and that seeing I had offered them so much Favour, I would be
as good as my Word; and that if he did not think fit to consent to
it, I would set them at Liberty, as I found them; and if he did not
like it, he might take them again if he could catch them.
Upon this they appear'd very thankful, and I accordingly set them
at Liberty, and bade them retire into the Woods to the Place whence
they came, and I would leave them some Fire Arms, some Ammuni-
tion, and some Directions how they should live very well, if they
thought fit
Upon this I prepar'd to go on Board the Ship, but told the
Captain, that I would stay that Night to prepare my things, and
desir'd him to go on Board in the meantime, and keep all right in
the Ship, and send the Boat on Shore the next Day for me; ordering
him in the meantime to cause the new Captain who was killed, to
be hanged at the Yard-arm that these Men might see him.
When the Captain was gone, I sent for the Men up to me to my
Apartment, and entered seriously into Discourse with them of their
Circumstances, I told them, I thought they had made a right
Choice; that if the Captain carry'd them away, they would certainly
be hanged. I showed them the new Captain, hanging at the Yard-
arm of the Ship, and told them they had nothing less to expect
When they had all declar'd their Willingness to stay, I then told
them, I would let them into the Story of my living there, and put
them into the Way of making it easy to them: Accordingly I gave
them the whole History of the Place, and of my coming to it;
showed them my Fortifications, the Way I made my Bread, planted
my Corn, cured my Grapes; and in a Word, all that was necessary
to make them easy: I told them the Story also of the sixteen
Spaniards that were to be expected; for whom I left a Letter, and
made them promise to treat them in common with themselves.
I left them my Fire Arms, viz. Five Muskets, three Fowling Pieces,
and three Swords. I had above a Barrel and half of Powder left;
for after the first Year or two, I used but little, and wasted none. I
gave them a Description of the Way I manag'd the Goats, and
Directions to milk and fatten them, and to make both Butter and
Cheese.
In a Word, I gave them every Part of my own Story; and I told
them, I would prevail with the Captain to leave them two Barrels of
Gunpowder more, and some Garden-Seeds, which I told them I
would have been very glad of; also I gave them the Bag of Pease
which the Captain had brought me to eat, and bade them be sure to
low and increase them.
Having done all this, I left them the next Day, and went on
Board the Ship : We prepared immediately to sail, but did not weigh
that Night: The next Morning early, two of the five Men came
swimming to the Ship's Side, and making a most lamentable Com-
plaint of the other three, begged to be taken into the Ship, for God's
Sake, for they should be murdered, and begged the Captain to take
them on Board, though he hanged them immediately.
Upon this the Captain pretended to have no Power without me;
But after some Difficulty, and after their solemn Promises of Amend-
ment, they were taken on Board, and were some time after soundly
whipped and pickled; after which, they proved very honest and
quiet Fellows.
Some time after this, the Boat was order'd on Shore, the Tide being
up, with the things promised to the Men, to which the Captain at my
Intercession caused their Chests and Clothes to be added, which
they took, and were very thankful for; I also encourag'd them, by
telling them, that if it lay in my Way to send any Vessel to take them
in, I would not forget them.
When I took leave of this Island, I carry'd on board for Relics, the
great Goat's-Skin-Cap I had made, my Umbrella, and my Parrot;
also I forgot not to take the Money I formerly mention'd, which had
lain by me so long useless, that it was grown rusty, or tarnish'd, and
could hardly pass for Silver, till it had been a little rubbed, and
handled; as also the Money I found in the Wreck of the Spanish
Ship.
And thus I left the Island, the Ninteenth of December, as I found
by the Ship's Account, in the Year 1686, after I had been upon it
eight-and-twenty Years, two Months, and 19 Days; being deliver'd
from this second Captivity, the same Day of the Month, that I first
made my Escape in the Bano-Longo, from among the Moors of
Sallu.
In this Vessel, after a long Voyage, I arriv'd in England, the
Eleventh of/une, in the Year 1687, having been thirty-and-five Years
absent
When I came to England, I was as perfect a Stranger to all the
World, as if I had never been known there. My Benefactor and
faithful Steward, who I had left in Trust with my Money, was alive;
but had had great Misfortunes in the World; was become a Widow
the second Time, and very low in the World: I made her easy as to
what she owed me, assuring her, I would give her no Trouble; but
on the contrary, in Gratitude to her former Care and Faithfulness to
me, J reliev'd her, as my little Stock would afford, which at that
Time would indeed allow me to do but little for her; but I assur'd
her, I would never forget her former Kindness to me; nor did I
forget her, when I had sufficient to help her, as shall be obseiVd in
its Place.
I went down afterwards into Yorkshire; but my Father was dead,
and my Mother, and all the Family extinct, except that I found two
Sisters, and two of the Children of one of my Brothers; and as I had
been long given over for dead, there had been no Provision made for
me; so that in a Word, I found nothing to relieve, or assist me; and
that little Money I had, would not do much for me, as to settling in
the World.
I met with one Piece of Gratitude indeed, which I did not expect;
and this was, That the Master of the Ship, who I had so happily
deliver'd, and by the same Means saved the Ship and Cargo, having
given a very handsome Account to the Owners, of the Manner how I
had saved the Lives of the Men, and the Ship, they invited me to meet
them, and some Merchants concern'd, and all together they made me
a very handsome Compliment upon the Subject, and a Present cf
almost two hundred Pounds Sterling.
But after making several Reflections upon the Circumstances of my
Life, and how little way this would go towards settling me in the
World, I resolv'd to go to Lisbon, and see if I might not come by
some Information of the State of my Plantation in the Brasils, and of
what was become of my Partner, who I had reason to suppose had
some Years now given me over for dead.
With this View I took Shipping for Lisbon, where I arrived in April
following; my Man Friday accompanying me very honestly in all
Ramblings, and proving a most faithful Servant upon all Occa-
sions.
When I came to Lisbon, I found out by Inquiry, and to my par-
ticular Satisfaction, my old Friend the Captain of the Ship, who first
took me up at Sea, off of the Shore of Africa: He was now grown
old, and had left oft" the Sea, having put his Son, who was far from a
young Man, into his Ship; and who still used the Brasil Trade.
The old Man did not know me, and indeed, I hardly knew him; but
I soon brought him to my Remembrance, and as soon brought
myself to his Remembrance, when I told him who I was.
After some passionate Expressions of the old Acquaintance, I in-
quir'd, you may be sure, after my Plantation and my Partner: The
old Man told me he had not been in the Brasils for about nine
Years; but that he could assure me, that when he came away, my
Partner was living, but the Trustees, who I had joined with him to
take Cognizance of my Part, were both dead; that however, he
believ'd that I would have a very good Account of the Improvement
of the Plantation; for that upon the general Belief of my being cast
away, and drowned, my Trustees had given in the Account of the
Produce of my Part of the Plantation, to the Procurator Fiscal, who
had appropriated it, in Case I never came to claim it; one Third to
the King, and two Thirds to the Monastery of St Augustine, to be ex
pended for the Benefit of the Poor, and for the Conversion of the
Indians to the Catholic Faith; but that if I appear'd, or any one for
me, to claim the Inheritance, it should be restor'd; only that the Im-
provement, or Annual Production, being distributed to charitable
Uses, could not be restor'd; but he assur'd me, that the Steward of
the King's Revenue (from Lands) and the Proviedore, or Steward of
the Monastery, had taken great Care all along, that the Incumbent,
that is to say my Partner, gave every Year a faithful Account of the
Produce, of which they receiv'd duly my Moiety.
I asked him if he knew to what height of Improvement he had
brought the Plantation? And, Whether he thought it might be worth
looking after? Or, Whether on my going thither, I should meet
with no Obstruction to my Possessing my just Right in the Moiety?
He told me, he could not tell exactly, to what Degree the Planta-
tion was improv'd; but this he knew, that my Partner was grown
exceeding Rich upon the enjoying but one half of it; and that to the
Dest of his Remembrance, he had heard, that the King's Third of
aiy Part, which was it seems granted away to some other Monastery,
or Religious House, amounted to above two hundred Moidores a
Year; that as to my being restor'd to a quiet Possession of it, there
was no question to be made of that, my Partner being alive to witness
rny Title, and my Name being also enrolled in the Register of the
Country; also he told me, That the Survivors of my two Trustees, were
very fair honest People, and very Wealthy; and he believ'd I would
not only have their Assistance for putting me in Possession, but would
find a very considerable Sum of Money in their Hands, for my Account,
being the Produce of the Farm while their Fathers held the Trust, and
oefore it was given up as above, which as he remember'd, was for about
twelve Years.
I showed myself a little concern'd, and uneasy at this Account, and
inquir'd of the old Captain, How it came to pass, that the Trustees
should thus dispose my Effects, when he knew that I had made my
Will, and had made him, the Portuguese Captain, my universal Heir, &c,
He told me, that was true; but that as there was no Proof of my
being dead, he could not act as Executor, until some certain Account
should come of my Death, and that besides, he was not willing to
intermeddle with a thing so remote; that it was true he had registered
my Will, and put in his Claim; and could he have given any Account
of my being dead or alive, he would have acted by Procuration, and
taken Possession of the Ingenio, so they called the Sugar-House, and
had given his Son, who was now at the Brasils, Order to do it
But, says the old Man, I have one Piece of News to tell you, which
perhaps may not be so acceptable to you as the rest, and that is,
That believing you were lost, and all the World believing so also,
your Partner and Trustees did offer to account to me in your Name,
for six or eight of the first Years of Profits, which I receiv'd; but
there being at that time, says he, great Disbursements for increasing
the Works, building an Ingenio, and buying Slaves, it did not amount
to near so much as afterwards it produced: However, says the old
Man, I shall give you a true Account of what I have received in all,
and how I have disposed of it
After a few Days' farther Conference with this ancient Friend, he
brought me an Account of the six first Years' Income of my Plan-
tation, signed by my Partner and the Merchants Trustees, being
always deliver'd in Goods, viz. Tobacco in Roll, and Sugar in
Chests, besides Rum, Molasses, &c. which is the Consequence of a
Sugar Work; and I found by this Account, that every Year the In-
come considerably increased; but as above, the Disbursement being
large, the Sum at first was small: However, the old Man let me see,
that he was Debtor to me 470 Moidores of Gold, besides 60 Chests
of Sugar, and 15 double Rolls of Tobacco which were lost in his
Ship; he having been Shipwreck'd coming Home to Lisbon about
11 Years after my leaving the Place.
The good Man then began to complain of his Misfortunes, and how
he had been obliged to make Use of my Money to recover his Losses,
and buy him a Share in a new Ship: However, my old Friend, says
he, you shall not want a Supply in your Necessity; and as soon as
my Son returns, you shall be fully satisfy'd.
Upon this, he pulls out an old Pouch, and gives me 160 Portugal
Moidores in Gold; and giving me the Writing of his Title to the Ship,
which his Son was gone to the Brasils in, of which he was a Quartet
Part Owner, and his Son another, he puts them both into my Hands
for Security of the rest
I was too much moved with the Honesty and Kindness of the poor
Man, to be able to bear this; and remembering what he had done
for me, how he had taken me up at Sea, and how generously he had
used me on all Occasions, and particularly, how sincere a Friend he
was now to me, I could hardly refrain Weeping at what he said to me:
Therefore, first I asked him, if his Circumstances admitted him to spare
so much Money at that time, and if it would not straiten him? He
told me, he could not say but it might straiten him a little; but
however it was my Money, and I might want it more than he.
Everything the good Man said was full of Affection, and I could
hardly refrain from Tears while he spoke: In short, I took 100 of the
Moidores, and called for a Pen and Ink to give him a Receipt for
tkem; then I returned him the rest, and told him, if ever I had Pos-
session of the Plantation, I would return the other to him also, as
indeed I afterwards did; and that as to the Bill of Sale of his Part in
his Son's Ship, I would not take it by any Means; but that if I wanted
the Money, I found he was honest enough to pay me; and if I did
not, but came to receive what he gave me reason to expect, I would
never have a Penny more from him.
When this was passed, the old Man began to ask me, If he should
put me into a Method to make my Claim to my Plantation? I told
him, I thought to go over to it myself: He said, I might do so if I
pleased; but that if I did not, there were Ways enough to secure my
Right, and immediately to appropriate the Profits to my Use; and as
there were Ships in the River of Lisbon, just ready to go away to
Brasil, he made me enter my Name in a Public Register, with his
Affidavit, affirming upon Oath that I was alive, and that I was the
game Person who took up the Land for the Planting the said Planta-
tion at first
This being regularly attested by a Notary, and a Procuration affix'd,
he directed me to send it with a Letter of his Writing, to a Merchant
of his Acquaintance at the Place, and then propos'd my staying with
him till an Account came of the Return.
Never anything was more honourable, than the Proceedings upon
this Procuration; for in less than seven Months, I receiv'd a large
Packet from the Survivors of my Trustees the Merchants, for whose
Account I went to Sea, in which were the following particular Letters
and Papers enclos'd.
First, There was the Account Current of the Produce of my Farm,
or Plantation, from the Year when their Fathers had balanc'd with my
old Portugal Captain, being for six Years; the Balance appear'd to
be 1174 Moidores in my Favour.
Secondly, There was the Account of four Years more while they
kept the Effects in their Hands, before the Government claimed the
Administration, as being the Effects of a Person not to be found,
which they call Civil Death; and the Balance of this, the Value of
the Plantation increasing, amounted to 3241 Moidores.
Thirdly, There was the Prior of the Augusti/tes' Account, who had
receiv'd the Profits for above fourteen Years; but not being to
account for what was dipos'd to the Hospital, very honestly declar'd
he had 87a Moidores not distributed, which he acknowledged to my
Account; as to the King's Part, that refunded nothing.
There was a Letter of my Partner's, congratulating me very affec-
tionately upon my being alive, giving me an Account how the Estate
was improv'd, and what it produced a Year, with a Particular of the
Number of Squares or Acres that it contained; how planted, how
many Slaves there were upon it, and making two-and-twenty Crosses
for Blessings, told me he had said so many Ave Marias to thank the
Blessed Virgin that I was alive; inviting me very passionately to come
over and take Possession of my own: and in the meantime to give
him Orders to whom he should deliver my Effects, if I did not come
myself; concluding with a hearty Tender of his Friendship, and that
of his Family, and sent me, as a Present, seven fine Leopards' Skins,
which he had it seems received from Africa, by some other Ship which
he had sent thither, and who it seems had made a better Voyage than
I: He sent me also five Chests of excellent Sweetmeats, and a hun-
dred Pieces of Gold uncoin'd, not quite so large as Moidores.
By the same Fleet, my two Merchant Trustees shipped me 1100
Chests of Sugar, 800 Rolls of Tobacco, and the rest of the whole
Account in Gold.
I might well say, now indeed, That the latter end of Job was better
than the Beginning. It is impossible to express here the Flutterings of
my very Heart, when I looked over these Letters, and especially when
I found all my Wealth about me; for as the Brasil Ships come all in
Fleets, the same Ships which brought my Letters, brought my Goods;
and the Effects were safe in the River before the Letters came to my
Hand. In a Word, I turned pale, and grew sick; and had not the
old Man run and fetched me a Cordial, I believe the sudden Surprise
of Joy had overset Nature, and I had died upon the Spot
Nay after that, I continu'd very ill, and was so some Hours, till a
Physician being sent for, and something of the real Cause of my Illness
being known, he order'd me to be let Blood; after which, I had
Relief, and grew well: But I verily believe, if it had not been
eased by a Vent given in that Manner, to the Spirits, I should have
died.
I was now Master, all on a Sudden, of above 5000/. Sterling in
Money, and had an Estate, as I might well call it, in the Brasils, of
above a thousand Pounds a Year, as sure as an Estate of Lands in
England: And in a Word, I was in a Condition which I scarce knew
how to understand, or how to compose myself, for the Enjoyment
of it
The first thing I did, was to recompense my original Benefactor, my
good old Captain, who had been first charitable to me in my Distress,
kind to me in my Beginning, and honest to me at the End: I showed
him all that was sent me, I told him, that next to the Providence of
Heaven, which disposes all things, it was owing to him; and that it
now lay on me to reward him, which I would do a hundred-fold: So
I first return'd to him the hundred Moidores I had receiv'd of him,
then I sent for a Notary, and caused him to draw up a general
Release or Discharge for the 470 Moidores, which he had acknowledg'd
he owed me in the fullest and firmest Manner possible; after which,
I caused a Procuration to be drawn, impowering him to be my Re-
ceiver of the annual Profits of my Plantation, and appointing my Part-
ner to account to him, and make the Returns by the usual Fleets to
him in my Name ; and a Clause in the End, being a Grant of 100 Moi-
dores a Year to him, during his Life, out of the Effects, and 50 Moidores
a Year to his Son after him, for his Life: And thus I requited my old
Man.
I was now to consider which Way to steer my Course next, and
what to do with the Estate that Providence had thus put into mj
Hands; and indeed I had more Care upon my Head now, than I
had in my silent State of Life in the Island, where I wanted nothing
but what I. had, and had nothing but what I wanted : Whereas t had
now a great Charge upon me, and my Business was how to secure it
i' had ne'er a Cave now to hide my Money in, or a Place where it
might lie without Lock or Key, till it grew mouldy and tarnish'd be-
fore anybody would meddle with it: On the contrary, I knew not
where to put it, or who to trust with it My old Patron, the Captain,
indeed was honest, and that was the only Refuge I had.
In the next Place, my Interest in the Brasils seemed to summon
me thither, but now I could not tell, how to think of going thither,
till I had settled my Affairs, and left my Effects in some safe Hands
behind me. At first I thought of my old Friend the Widow, who I
knew was honest, and would be just to me; but then she was in
Years, and but poor, and for ought I knew, might be in Debt; so
that in a Word, I had no Way but to go back to England myself,
and take my Effects with me.
It was some Months however before I resolved upon this; and there-
fore, as I had rewarded the old Captain fully, and to his Satisfaction,
who had been my former Benefactor, so I began to think of my poor
Widow, whose Husband had been my first Benefactor, and she,
while it was in her Power, my faithful Steward and Instructor. So
the first thing I did, I got a Merchant in Lisbon to write to his Cor-
respondent in London, not only to pay a Bill, but to go find her
out, and carry her in Money a hundred Pounds from me, and to
talk with her, and comfort her in her Poverty, by telling her she
should, if I lived, have a further Supply: At the same time I sent my
two Sisters in the Country, each of them a Hundred Pounds, they be-
ing though not in Want, yet not in very good Circumstances; one
having been marry'd and left a Widow; and the other having a Hus-
band not so kind to her as he should be.
But among all my Relations, or Acquaintances, I could not yet
pitch upon one, to whom I durst commit the Gross of my Stock, that
I might go away to the Brasils, and leave things safe behind me; and
this greatly perplex'd me.
I had once a Mind to have gone to the Brasils, and have settled my-
self there ; for I was, as it were, naturaliz'd to the Place; but I had some
little Scruple in my Mind about Religion, which insensibly drew me
back, of which I shall say more presently. However, it was not
Religion that kept me from going there for the present; and as I had
made no Scruple of being openly of the Reli/nVn ->f the Country, aD
the while I was among them, so neither did I yet; only that now
and then having of late thought more of it, (than formerly) when I
began to think of living and dying among them, I began to regret
my having profess'd myself a Papist, and thought it might not be the
best Religion to die with.
But as I have said, this was not the main thing that kept me from
going to the Brasils, but that really I did not know with whom to leave
my Effects behind me; so I resolv'd at last to go to England with it,
where, if I arrived, I concluded I should make some Acquaintance,
or find some Relations that would be faithful to me; and accord-
ing I prepar'd to go for England with all my Wealth.
In order to prepare things for my going Home, I first, the Brasil
Fleet being just going away, resolved to give Answers suitable
to the just and faithful Account of things I had from thence; and
first to the Prior of St Augustine I wrote a Letter full of Thanks for
Iheir just Dealings, and the Offer of the 872 Moidores, which was un-
disposed of, which I desir'd might be given 500 to the Monastery,
and 372 to the Poor, as the Prior should direct, desiring the good
Padres1 Prayers for me, and the like.
I wrote next a Letter of Thanks to my two Trustees, with all the
Acknowledgment that so much Justice and Honesty called for;
as for sending them any Present, they were far above having any
Occasion of it
Lastly, I wrote to my Partner, acknowledging his Industry in tne
Improving the Plantation, and his Integrity in increasing the Stock
of the Works, giving him Instructions for his future Government of
my Part, according to the Powers I had left with my old Patron, to
whom I desir'd him to send whatever became due to me, till he
should hear from me more particularly; assuring him that it was my
Intention, not only to come to him, but to settle myself there for the
Remainder of my Life: To this I added a very handsome Present
of some Italian Silks for his Wife, and two Daughters, for such the
Captain's Son inform'd me he had; with two Pieces of fine English
broad Cloth, the best I could get in Lisbon, five Pieces of black
Baise, and some Flanders Lace of a good Value.
Having thus settled my Affairs, sold my Cargo, and turned all my
Effects into good Bills of Exchange, my next Difficulty was, which
Way to go to England: I had been accustom'd enough to the Sea,
and yet I had a strange Aversion to going to England by Sea
at that time; and though I could give no Reason for it, yet the
Difficulty increas'd upon me so much, that though I had once
shipped my Baggage, in order to go, yet I alter'd my Mind, and that
not once, but two or three times.
It is true, I had been very unfortunate by Sea, and this might be
some of the Reason: But let no Man slight the strong Impulses of
his own Thoughts in Cases of such Moment: Two of the Ships
which I had singled out to go in, I mean, more particularly singled
out than any other, that is to say, so as in one of them to put my
things on Board, and in the other to have agreed with the Captain;
I say, two of these Ships miscarry'd, viz. One was taken by the
Algerine, and the other was cast away on the Start near Torbay, and
all the People drowned except three; so that in either of those
Vessels I had been made miserable; and in which most, it was hard
to say.
Having been thus harass'd in my Thoughts, my old Pilot, to
whom I communicated everything, pressed me earnestly not to go
by Sea, but either to go by Land to the Groyne, and cross over the
Bay of Biscay to Rochclle, from whence it was but an easy and safe
Journey by Land to Paris, and so to Calais and Dover; or to go up
to Madrid, and so all the Way by Land through France.
In a Word, I was so prepossess'd against my going by Sea at all,
except from Calais to Dover, that I resolv'd to travel all the Way by
Land; which as I was not in Haste, and did not value the Charge, was
by much the pleasanter Way; and to make it more so, my old Cap-
tain brought an English Gentleman, the Son of a Merchant in Lisbon,
who was willing to travel with me: After which, we picked up two
more English Merchants also, and two young Portuguese Gentlemen,
the last going to Paris only; so that we were in all six of us, and
five Servants; the two Merchants and the two Portuguese, content-'
ing themselves with one Servant, between two, to save the
Charge; and as for me, I got an English Sailor to travel with me as a
Servant, besides my Man Friday, who was too much a Stranger to
be capable of supplying the Place of a Servant on the Road.
In this Manner I set out from Lisbon; and our Company being all
very well mounted and armed, we made a little Troop, whereof they
did me the Honour to call me Captain, as well because I was the
oldest Man, as because I had two Servants, and indeed was the
Original of the whole Journey.
As I have troubled you with none of my Sea-Journals, so I shall
trouble you now with none of my Land-Journal: But some Adven-
tures that happen'd to us in this tedious and difficult Journey, I must
not omit
When we came to Madrid, we being all of us Strangers to Spain,
were willing to stay some time to see the Court of Spain, and to see
what was worth observing; but it being the latter Part of the Summer,
we hasten'd away, and set out from Madrid about the Middle of
October: But when we came to the Edge of Navarre, we were alarm'd
at several Towns on the Way, with an Account, that so much Snow
was fallen on the French Side of the Mountains, that several Travellers
were obliged to come back to Pampeluna, after having attempted, at
an extreme Hazard, to pass on.
When we came to Pampeluna itself, we found it so indeed; and to
me that had been always used to a hot Climate, and indeed to
Countries where we could scarce bear any Clothes on, the Cold was
Kisufferable; nor indeed was it more painful than it was surprising, to
come but ten Days before out of the Old Castile, where the Weather
was not only warm but very hot, and immediately to feel a Wind
from the Pyrenean Mountains, so very keen, so .severely cold, as to
be intolerable, and to endanger benumbing and perishing of our
Fingers and Toes.
Poor Friday was really frighted when he saw the Mountains all
cover'd with Snow, and felt cold Weather, which he had never seen or
felt before in his Life.
To mend the Matter, when we came to Pampeluna, it continued
snowing with so much Violence, and so long, that the People said,
Winter was come before its time, and the Roads which were difficult
before, were now quite impassable: For in a Word, the Snow lay in
some Places too thick for us to travel; and being not hard frozen, as
is the Case in Northern Countries: There was no going without being
in Danger of being buried alive every Step. We stayed no less than
twenty Days at Pampeluna; when seeing the Winter coming on, and
no Likelihood of its being better; for it was the severest Winter all
over Europe that had been known in the Memory of Man, I propos'd
that we should all go away to Fontarabia, and there take Shipping for
Bourdeaux, which was a very little Voyage.
But while we were considering this, there came in four French Gen-
tlemen, who having been stopped on the French Side of the Passes,
as we were on the Spanish, had found out a Guide, who traversing the
Country near the Head of Languedoc, had brought them over the
Mountains by such Ways, that they were not much incommoded with
the Snow; and where they met with Snow in any Quantity, they said
it was frozen hard enough to bear them and their Horses.
We sent for this Guide, who told us, he would undertake to carry
us the same Way with no Hazard from the Snow, provided we were
armed sufficiently to protect ourselves from wild Beasts; for he said, upon
these great Snows, it was frequent for some Wolves to show them-
selves at the Foot of the Mountains, being made ravenous for Want
of Food, the Ground being covered with Snow : We told him, we were
well enough prepar'd for such Creatures as they were, if he would ensure
us from a Kind of two-legged Wolves, which we were told, we were in
most Danger from, especially on the French Side of the Mountains.
He satisfy'd us there was no Danger of that kind in the Way that we
were to go; so we readily agreed to follow him, as did also twelve
other Gentlemen, with their Servants, some French, some Spanish; who,
as I said, had attempted to go, and were oblig'd to come back again.
Accordingly, we all set out from Pampeluna, with our Guide, on the
fifteenth of November; and indeed, I was surpris'd, when instead o*
going forward, he came directly back with us, on the same Road that
we came from Madrid, above twenty Miles; when being passed two
Rivers, and come into the plain Country, we found ourselves in a
warm Climate again, where the Country was pleasant, and no Snow
to be seen; but on a sudden, turning to his left, he approach'd the
Mountains another Way; and though it is true, the Hills and Preci-
pices looked dreadful, yet he made so many Tours, such Meanders,
and led us by such winding Ways, that we were insensibly passed the
Height of the Mountains, without being much incumber'd with the
Snow; and all on a sudden, he showed us the pleasant fruitful Pro-
vinces of Languedoc and Gascoign, all green and flourishing; though
indeed it was at a great Distance, and we had some rough Way to
pass yet
We were a little uneasy however, when we found it snowed one
whole Day, and a Night, so fast, that we could not travel; but hft
bid us be easy, we should soon be past it all: We found indeed, that
we began to descend every Day, and to come more North than
before; and so depending upon our Guide, we went on.
It was about two Hours before Night, when our Guide being some-
*59
thing before us, and not just in Sight, out rushed three monstrous
Wolves, and after them a Bear, out of a hollow Way, adjoining to a
thick Wood; two of the Wolves flew upon the Guide, and had he
Deen half a Mile before us, he had been devour'd indeed, before we
could have helped him: One of them fastened upon his Horse, and
the other attack'd the Man with that Violence, that he had not Time,
or not Presence of Mind enough to draw his Pistol, but hollow'd and
cried out to us most lustily; my Man Friday being next me, I bid
him ride up, and see what was the Matter; as soon as Friday came
in Sight of the Man, he hollow'd as loud as the other, 0 MasterI 0
Master I But like a bold FeUow, rode directly up to the poor Man,
and with his Pistol shot the Wolf that attack'd him into the Head.

It was happy for the poor Man, that it was my Man Friday; for
he having been used to that kind of Creature in his Country, had no
Fear upon him; but went close up to him, and shot him as above;
whereas any of us, would have fired at a farther Distance, and have
perhaps either missed the Wolf, or endanger'd shooting the Man.
But it was enough to have terrify'd a bolder Man than I, and
indeed it alarm'd all our Company, when with the Noise of Friday's
Pistol, we heard on both Sides the dismallest Howling of Wolves,
and the Noise redoubled by the Echo of the Mountains, that it was
to us as if there had been a prodigious Multitude of them; and per-
haps indeed there were not such a Few, as that we had no cause of
Apprehensions.
However, as Friday had killed this Wolf, the other that had
fastened upon the Horse, left him immediately, and fled; having
happily fastened upon his Head, where the Bosses of the Bridle had
stuck in his teeth; so that he had not done him much Hurt: The
Man indeed was most hurt; for the raging Creature had bit him
twice, once on the Arm, and the other Time a little above his Knee;
and he was just as it were tumbling down by the Disorder of his
Horse, when Friday came up and shot the Wolf.
It is easy to suppose, that at the Noise of Friday's Pistol, we all
mended our Pace, and rid up as fast as the Way (which was very
difficult) would give us leave, to see what was the Matter; as soon as
we came clear of the Trees, which blinded us before, we saw clearly
what had been the Case, and how Friday had disengag'd the poor
Guide; though we did not presently discern what kind of Creature it
was he had killed.
But never was a Fight manag'd so hardily, and in such a surprising
Manner, as that which follow'd between Friday and the Bear, which
gave us all (though at first we were surpris'd and afraid for him) the
greatest Diversion imaginable: As the Bear is a heavy, clumsy
Creature, and does not gallop as the Wolf does, who is swift, and
light; so he has two particular Qualities, which generally are the
Rule of his Actions; First, As to Men, who are not his proper Prey;
I say, not his proper Prey; because thqugh I cannot say what ex-
cessive Hunger might do, which was now their Case, the Ground
being all cover'd with Snow; but as to Men, he does not usually
attempt them, unless they first attack him: On the contrary, if you
meet him in the Woods, if you don't meddle with him, he won't
meddle with you; but then you must take Care to be very Civil to
him, and give him the Road; for he is a very nice Gentleman, he
won't go a Step out of his Way for a Prince; nay, if you are really
afraid, your best way is to look another Way, and keep going on; for
sometimes if you stop, and stand still, and look steadily at him, he
takes it for an Affront; but if you throw or toss anything at him, and
it hits him, though it were but a bit of Stick, as big as your Finger, he
takes it for an Affront, and sets all his other Business aside to pursue
his Revenge; for he will have Satisfaction in Point of Honour; that
is his first Quality: The next is, That if he be once affronted, he will
never leave you, Night or Day, till he has his Revenge; but follows
at a good round rale, till he overtakes you.

to him, he was helping him off from his Horse; for the Man was
Doth hurt and frighted, and indeed, the last more than the first; when
on the sudden, we spied the Bear come out of the Wood, and a vast
monstrous One it was, the biggest by far that ever I saw: We were
all a little surpris'd, when we saw him; but when Friday saw him, it
was easy to see Joy and Courage in the Fellow's Countenance;
O I 01 OI Says Friday, three Times, pointing to him; O Master!
You give me te Leave I Me shakee te Hand with him: Me make you
good laugh.
I was surpris'd to see the Fellow so pleased; You Fool you, says I, he
will eat you up I Eatee me up I Eatee me up I Says Friday, twice over again;
Me eatee him up: Me make you good laugh: You all stay here, me show
you good laugh; so down he sits, and gets his Boots off in a Moment,
and put on a pair of Pumps (as we call the flat Shoes they wear) and
which he had in his Pocket, gives my other Servant his Horse,
and with his Gun away he flew swift like the Wind.
The Bear was walking softly on, and offer'd to meddle with nobody,
till Friday coming pretty near, calls to him, as if the Bear could under-
standhim; Ifarkye,harkye,sa.ysFriday,mespeakee wityou: Wefollow'
d
at a Distance; for now being come down on the Gascoign side of
the Mountains, we were enter'd a vast great Forest, where the Country
was plain, and pretty open, though many Trees in it scatter'd her*
and here.
Friday, who had as we say, the Heels of the Bear, came up with
him quickly, and takes up a great Stone, and throws at him, and hit
him just on the Head; but did him no more harm, than if he had
thrown it against a Wall; but it answer'd Friday's End; for the
Rogue was so void of Fear, that he did it purely to make the Bear
follow him, and show us some Laugh as he called it
As soon as the Bear felt the Stone, and saw him, he turns about,
and comes after him, taking Devilish long Strides, and shuffling
along at a strange Rate, so as would have put a Horse to a middling
Gallop; away runs Friday, and takes his Course, as if he ran
towards us for Help; so we all resolv'd to fire at once upon the Bear,
and deliver my Man; though I was angry at him heartily, for bring-
ing the Bear back upon us, when he was going about his own
Business another Way; and especially I was angry that he had
turned the Bear back upon us, and then run away; and I called out,
You Dog, said I, is this your making us laugh? Come away, and take
your Horse, that we may shoot the Creature; he hears me, and cries
out, No shoot, no shoot, stand still, you get much Laugh. And as the
nimble Creature ran two Foot for the Beast's one, he turned on a
sudden, on one side of us, and seeing a great Oak-Tree, fit for his
Purpose, he beckon'd to us to follow, and doubling his Pace*
he gets nimbly up the Tree, laying his Gun down upon the
Ground, at about five or six Yards from the Bottom of the Tree.
The Bear soon came to the Tree, and we follow'd at a Distance;
the first Thing he did, he stopped at the Gun, smelt to it, but let it lie,
and up he scrambles into the Tree, climbing like a Cat, though so
monstrously heavy: I was amaz'd at the Folly, as I thought it, of my
Man, and could not for my Life see anything to laugh at yet, till see-
ing the Bear get up the Tree, we all rode nearer to him.
When we came to the Tree, there was Friday got out to the small
End of a large Limb of the Tree, and the Bear got about half way to
him; as soon as the Bear got out to that part where the Limb of the
Tree was weaker, Ha, says he to us, noiv you see me teachce the Bear
dance; so he falls a jumping and shaking the Bough, at which the
Bear began to totter, but stood still, and began to look behind him,
to see how he should get back; then indeed we did laugh heartily:
But Friday had not done with him by a great deal; when he sees
him stand still, he calls out to him again, as if he had suppos'd the
Bear could speak English; What, you no come farther, pray you
come farther; so he left jumping and shaking the Tree; and the
Bear, just as if he had understood what he said, did come a little
further, then he fell a jumping again, and the Bear stopped again.
We thought now was a good time to knock him on the Head, and
I call'd to Friday to stand still, and we would shoot the Bear;
but he cried out earnestly, O pray I O pray I No shoot, me shoot, by
and then; he would have said, By and by; However, to shorten the
Story, Friday danced so much, and the Bear stood so ticklish, that
we had laughing enough indeed, but still could not imagine what the
Fellow would do; for first we thought he depended upon shaking the
Bear off; and we found the Bear was too cunning for that too; for
he would not go out far enough to be thrown down, but clings fast
with his great broad Claws and Feet, so that we could not imagine
what would be the End of it, and where the Jest would be at last
But Friday put us out of doubt quickly; for seeing the Bear cling
fast to the Bough, and that he would not be persuaded to come any
farther; Well, well, says Friday, you no come farther, me go, megoj
you no come to me, me go come to you; and upon this, he goes out tc
the smallest End of the Bough, where it would bend with his Weight
and gently lets himself down by it, sliding down the Bough, till he
came near enough to jump down on his Feet, and away he run to his
Gun, takes it up, and stands still.
Well, said I to him, Friday, What will you do now? Why don't
you shoot him? No shoot, says Friday, no yet, me shoot now, me no kill;
me stay, give you one more laugh; and indeed so he did, as you will see
presently; for when the Bear see his Enemy gone, he comes back
from the Bough where he stood; but did it mighty leisurely, looking
behind him every Step, and coming backward till he got into the
Body of the Tree; then with the same hinder End foremost, he came
down the Tree, grasping it with his Claws, and moving one Foot
at a Time, very leisurely; at this Juncture, and just before he could set
his hind Feet upon the Ground, Friday stepped up close to him, clapt
the Muzzle of his Piece into his Ear, and shot him dead as a Stone.
Then the Rogue turned about, to see if we did not laugh, and when
he saw we were pleased by our Looks, he falls a laughing himself
very loud; so we kill Bear in my Country, says Friday; so you kill
them, says I, Why you have no Guns: No, says he, no Gun, but shoot,
great much long Arrow.
This was indeed a good Diversion to us; but we were still in a
wild Place, and our Guide very much hurt, and what to do we hardly
knew; the Howling of Wolves ran much in my Head; and indeed,
except the Noise I once heard on the Shore of Africa, of which I have
said something already, I never heard anything that filled me with so
much Horror.
These things, and the Approach of Night, called us off, or else, as
Friday would have had us, we should certainly have taken the Skin
of this monstrous Creature off, which was worth saving; but we had
three Leagues to go, and our Guide hasten'd us, so we left him, and
went forward on our Journey.
The Ground was still cover'd with Snow, though not so deep and
dangerous as on the Mountains, and the ravenous Creatures, as we heard
afterwards, were come down into the Forest and plain Country, pressed
by Hunger to seek for Food; and had done a great deal of Mischief
in the Villages, where they surpris'd the Country People, killed a grea*
many of their Sheep and Horses, and some People too.
We had one dangerous Place to pass, which our Guide told us, il
there were any more Wolves in the Country, we should find them
there; and this was in a small Plain, surrounded with Woods on
every Side, and a long narrow Defile or Lane, which we were to pass
to get through the Wood, and then we should come to the Village
where we were to lodge.
It was within half an Hour of Sunset when we enter'd the first Wood;
and a little after Sunset when we came into the Plain, we met with
nothing in the first Wood, except, that in a little Plain within the Woe?,
which was not above two Furlongs over, we saw five great Wolves
cross the Road, full Speed one after another, as if they had been in
Chase of some Prey, and had it in View, they took no Notice of us,
and were gone, and out of our Sight in a few Moments.
Upon tSiis jut Guide, who by the Way was a wretched faint-hearted
Fellow, bid us keep in a ready Posture; for he believed there were
more Wolves a coming.
We kept our Arms ready, and our Eyes about us, but we saw no
more Wolves, till we came through that Wood, which was near half a
League, and enter'd the Plain; as soon as we came into the Plain, we had
Occasion enough to look about us : The first Object we met with, was a
dead Horse; that is to say, a poor Horse which the Wolves had killed,
and at least a Dozen of them at Work; we could not say eating of him,
but picking of his Bones rather; for they had eaten up all the Flesh before.
We did not think fit to disturb them at their Feast, neither did they
take much Notice of us: Friday would have let fly at them, but I
would not suffer him by any Means; for I found we were like to have
more Business upon our Hands than we were aware of. We were not
gone half over the Plain, but we began to hear the Wolves howl in the
Wood on our Left, in a frightful Manner, and presently after we saw
about a hundred coming on directly towards us, all in a Body, and
most of them in a Line, as regularly as an Army drawn up by expe-
rienc'd Officers. I scarce knew in what Manner to receive them; but
found to draw ourselves in a close Line was the only Way: so we
formed in a Moment: But that we might not have too much Interval,
I order'd that only every other Man should fire, and that the others who
had not fired should stand ready to give them a second Volley imme-
diately, if they continued to advance upon us, and that then those who
had fired at first, should not pretend to load their Fusees again, but
stand ready with every one a Pistol; for we were all armed with a
Fusee, and a Pair of Pistols each Man; so we were by this Method
able to file six Volleys, half of us at a Time; however, at present we
had no Necessity; for upon firing the first Volley, the Enemy made a
full Stop, being terrify'd as well with the Noise, as with the Fire ; four
of them being shot into the Head, dropped, several others were
wounded, and went bleeding off, as we could see by the Snow: I
found they stopped, but did not immediately retreat; whereupon re-
membering that I had been told, that the fiercest Creatures were
terrify'd at the Voice of a Man, I caused all our Company to hollow
as loud as we could; and I found the Notion not altogether mistaken;
for upon our Shout, they began to retire, and turn about; then I
order'd a second Volley to be fired, in their Rear, which put them to
the Gallop, and away they went to the Woods.
This gave us leisure to charge our Pieces again, and that we might
lose no Time, we kept going; but we had but little more than loaded
our Fusees, and put ourselves into a Readiness, when we heard a
terrible Noise in the same Wood, on our Left, only that it was farther
onward the same Way we were to go.
The Night was coming on, and the Light began to be dusky, which
made it worse on our Side; but the Noise increasing, we could easily
perceive that it was the Howling and Yelling of those hellish Creatures;
and on a sudden, we perceiv'd 2 or 3 Troops of Wolves, one on our
Left, one behind us, and one on our Front; so that we seemed to be
surrounded with them ; however, as they did not fall upon us, we kept
our Way forward, as fast as we could make our Horses go, which the
Way being very rough, was only a good large Trot; and in this
Manner we came in View of the Entrance of a Wood, through which
we were to pass, at the farther Side of the Plain; but we were greatly
surpris'd, when coming nearer the Lane, or Pass, we saw a confus'd
Number of Wolves standing just at the Entrance.
On a sudden, at another opening of the Wood, we heard the Noise of
a Gun; and looking that Way, out rushed a Horse, with a Saddle, and
a Bridle on him, flying like the Wind, and sixteen or seventeen Wolves
after him, full Speed; indeed, the Horse had the Heels of them; but
as we suppos'd that he could not hold it at that rate, we doubted not
but they would get up with him at last, and no question but they did.
But here we had a most horrible Sight; for riding up to the
Entrance where the Horse came out, we found the Carcass of another
Horse, and of two Men, devour'd by the ravenous Creatures, and one
x

ADVENTURES OF
of the Men was no doubt the same who we heard fired the Gun ; foi
there lay a Gun just by him, fired off; but as to the Man, his Head,
and the upper Part of his Body was eaten up.
This filled us with Horror, and we knew not what Course to take,
but the Creatures resolv'd us soon; for they gather'd about us
presently, in hopes of Prey; and I verily believe there were three
hundred of them: It happen'd very much to our Advantage, that at
the Entrance into the Wood, but at a little Way from it, there lay
some large Timber Trees, which had been cut down the Summer
before, and I suppose lay there for Carriage; I drew my little Troop
in among those Trees, and placing ourselves in a Line, behind
.one lone Tree, I advis'd them all to light, and keeping that Tree


before us, for a Breast-Work, to stand in a Triangle, w three Fronts
enclosing our Horses in the Centre.
We did so, and it was well we did; for never was a more furious
Charge than the Creatures made upon us in the Place; they came on
us with a growling kind of a Noise (and mounted the Piece of
Timber,which as I said was our Breast-Work) as if they were only
rushing upon their Prey; and this Fury of theirs, it seems, was princi-
pally occasion'd by their seeing our Horses behind us, which was the
Prey they aimed at: I order'd our Men to fire as before, every other
Man; and they took their Aim so sure, that indeed they killed several
of the Wolves at the first Volley; but there was a Necessity to keep a
continual Firing; for they came on like Devils, those behind pushing
on those before.
When we had fired our second Volley of our Fusees, we thought
they stopped a little, and I hoped they would have gone off; but it
was but a Moment; for others came forward again; so we fired two
Volleys of our Pistols, and I believe in these four Firings, we had
killed seventeen or eighteen of them, and lamed twice as many; yet
they came on again.
I was loth to spend our last Shot too hastily; so I called my
Servant, not my Man Friday, for he was better employ'd; for with
the greatest Dexterity imaginable, he had charged my Fusee, and his
own, while we were engag'd; but as I said, I called my other Man,
and giving him a Horn of Powder, I bade him lay a Train, all along
the Piece of Timber, and let it be a large Train; he did so, and had
but just Time to get away, when the Wolves came up to it, and some
were got up upon it; when I snapping an uncharg'd Pistol, close to
the Powder, set it on fire; those that were upon the Timber were
scorched with it, and six or seven of them fell, or rather jumped in
among us, with the Force and Fright of the Fire, we dispatch'd these
in an Instant, and the rest were so frighted with the Light, which the
Night, for it was now very near Dark, made more terrible, that they
drew back a little.
Upon which I order'd our last Pistol to be fired off in one Volley,
and after that we gave a Shout; upon this, the Wolves turned Tail,,
and we sally'd immediately upon near twenty lame Ones, who we
found struggling on the Ground, and fell a cutting them with our
Swords, which answer'd our Expectation; for the Crying and How-
ling they made, was better understood by their Fellows, so that they
all fled and left us.
We had, first and last, killed about three Score of them; and had
•t been Daylight, we had killed many more: The Field of Battle
being thus cleared, we made forward again; for we had still near a
League to go. We heard the ravenous Creatures howl and yell in
the Woods as we went, several Times; and sometimes we fancy'd we
saw some of them, but the Snow dazzling our Eyes, we were not
certain; so in about an Hour more, we came to the Town, where we
were to lodge, which we found in a terrible Fright, and all in Arms;
for it seems, that the Night before, the Wolves and some Bears had
broke into the Village in the Night, and put them in a terrible Frigh^
and they were oblig'd to keep Guard Night and Day, but especially
tp the Night, to preserve their Cattle, and indeed their People.
The next Morning our Guide was so ill, and his Limbs swelled
with the rankling of his two Wounds, that he could go no farther; so
we were oblig'd to take a new Guide there, and go to Thoulouse, where
we found a warm Climate, a fruitful pleasant Country, and no Snow,
no Wolves, or anything like them; but when we told our Story at
Thoulouse, they told us it was nothing but what was ordinary in the
great Forest at the Foot of the Mountains, especially when the Snow
lay on the Ground: But they inquir'd much what kind of a Guide
we had gotten, that would venture to bring us that Way in such a
severe Season; and told us, it was very much we were not all de-
vour'd. . When we told them how we placed ourselves, and the
Horses in the Middle, they blamed us exceedingly, and told us it was
fifty to one but we had been all destroy'd; for it was the Sight of the
Horses which made the Wolves so furious, seeing their Prey; and
that at other Times they are really afraid of a Gun; but they being ex-
cessive Hungry, and raging on that Account, the Eagerness to come
at the Horses had made them senseless of Danger; and that if we
had not by the continu'd Fire, and at last by the Stratagem of the
Train of Powder, master'd them, it had been great Odds but that we
had been torn to Pieces; whereas had we been content to have sat
still on Horseback, and fired as Horsemen, they would not have
taken the Horses for so much their own, when Men were on theii
Backs, as otherwise; and withal they told us, that at last, if we had
stood altogether, and left our Horses, they would have been so
eager to have devour'd them, that we might have come off safe,
especially having our Fire Arms in our Hands, and being so many
in Number.
For my Part, I was never so sensible of Danger in my Life; for
seeing above three hundred Devils come roaring and opened mouthed
to devour us, and having nothing to shelter us, or retreat to, I gave
myself over for lost; and as it was, I believe, I shall never care to cross
those Mountains again; I think I would much rather go a thousand
Leagues by Sea, though I were sure to meet with a Storm once a Week.
I have nothing uncommon to take Notice of, in my Passage
through France; nothing but what other Travellers have given an
Account of, with much more Advantage than I can. I travell'd from
Thoulouse to Paris, and without any considerable Stay, came to Ca-
lais, and landed safe at Dover, the fourteenth ot January, after having
bad a severely cold Season to travel in.
I was now come to the Centre of ray Travels, and had in a little
Time all my new discover'd Estate safe about me, the Bills of Ex-
change which I brought with me having been very currently paid.
My principal Guide, and Privy Counsellor, was my good ancient
Widow, who in Gratitude for the Money I had sent her, thought no
Tains too much, or Care too great, to employ for me; and I trusted
her so entirely with everything, that I was perfectly easy as to the
Security of my Effects; and indeed, I was very happy from my
Beginning, and now to the End, in the unspotted Integrity of this
good Gentlewoman.
And now I began to think of leaving my Effects with this Woman,
and setting out for Lisbon, and so to the Brasils; but now another
Scruple came in my Way, and that was Religion; for as I had en-
tertain'd some Doubts about the Roman Religion, even while I was
abroad, especially in my State of Solitude; so I knew there was no
going to the Brasils for me, much less going to settle there, unless I
resoh/d to embrace the Roman Catholic Religion, without any
Reserve; unless on the other hand, I resolv'd to be a Sacrifice to my
Principles, be a Martyr for Religion, and die in the Inquisition; so
I resolv'd to stay at Home, and if I could find Means for it, to
dispose of my Plantation.
To this Purpose I wrote to my old Friend at Lisbon, who in
Return gave me Notice, that he could easily dispose of it there: But
that if I thought fit to give him Leave to offer it in my Name to the
two Merchants, the Survivors of my Trustees, who lived in the
Brasils, who must fully understand the Value of it, who lived just
upon the Spot, and who I knew were very rich; so that he believ'd
they would be fond of buying it; he did not doubt, but I should
make 4 or 5000 Pieces of Eight, the more of it
Accordingly I agreed, gave him Order to offer it to them, and he
did so; and in about 8 Months more, the Ship being then return'd,
he sent me an Account, that they had accepted the Offer, and had
remitted 33,000 Pieces of Eight, to a Correspondent of theirs at
Lisbon, to pay for it
In Return, I signed the Instrument of Sale in the Form which
they sent from Lisbon, and sent it to my old Man, who sent me Bills
of Exchange for 32,800 Pieces of Eight to me, for the Estate; re-
serving the Payment of too Moidores a Year to him, the old Man,
during his Life, and 50 Moidores afterwards to his Son for his Life,
which I had promised them, which the Plantation was to make good
as a Rentcharge. And thus I have given the first Part of a Life of
Fortune and Adventure, a Life of Providence's Chequer-work, and
of a Variety which the World will seldom be able to show the like of:
Beginning foolishly, but closing much more happily than any Part of
it ever gave me Leave so much as to hope for.
Any one would think, that in this State of complicated good
Fortune, I was past running any more Hazards; and so indeed I
had been, if other Circumstances had concurr'd, but I was inur'd tn
a wandering Life, had no Family, not many Relations, nor however
rich had I contracted much Acquaintance; and though I had sold
my Estate iivthe Brasils, yet I could not keep the Country out of my
Head, and had a great Mind to be upon the Wing again, especially
I could not resist the strong Inclination I had to see my Island, and
to know if the poor Spaniards were in Being there, and how the
Rogues I left there had used them.
My true Friend, the Widow, earnestly dissuaded me from it, and
so far prevail'd with me, that for almost seven Years she prevented
my running Abroad; during which time, I took my two Nephews, the
Children of one of my Brothers, into my Care: The eldest having
something of his own, I bred up as a Gentleman, and gave him a
Settlement of some Addition to his Estate, after my Decease; the
other I put out to a Captain of a Ship; and after five Years, finding
him a sensible bold enterprising young Fellow, I put him into a good
Ship, and sent him to Sea: And this young Fellow afterwards drew
me in, as old as I was, to farther Adventures myself.
In the meantime, I in Part settled myself here; for first of all I
marry'd, and that not either to my Disadvantage or Dissatisfaction,
and had three Children, two Sons and one Daughter: But my Wife
dying, and my Nephew coming Home with good Success from a
Voyage to Spain, my Inclination to go Abroad, and his Importunity
prevailed and engag'd me to go in his Ship, as a private Trader to
the East Indies: This was in the Year 1694.
In this Voyage I visited my new Colony in the Island, saw my
Successors the Spaniards, had the whole Story of their Lives, and of
the Villains I left there; how at first they insulted the poor Spaniards,
how they afterwards agreed, disagreed, united, separated, and how at
last the Spaniards were oblig'd to use Violence with them, how they
were subjected to the Spaniards, how honestly the Spaniards used
them; a History, if it were enter'd into, as full of Variety and won-
derful Accidents, as my own Part, particularly also as to their Battles
with the Caribbeans, who landed several times upon the Island, and
as to the Improvements they made upon the Island itself, and how
five of them made an Attempt upon the main Land, and brought
away eleven Men and five Women Prisoners, by which at my coming,
I found about twenty young Children on the Island.
.Here I stayed about 20 Days, left them Supplies of all neces-
sary things, and particularly of Arms, Powder, Shot, Clothes, Tools,
and two Workmen, which I brought from England with me, viz. a
Carpenter and a Smith.
Besides this, I shared the Island into Parts with them, and reserv'd
to myself the Property of the whole, but gave them such Parts res-
pectively as they agreed on; and having settled all things with them,
and engaged them not to leave the Place, I left them there.
From thence I touched at the Brasils, from whence I sent a Bark,
which I bought there, with more People to the Island, and in it, be-
sides other Supplies, I sent seven Women, being such as I found
proper for Service, or for Wives to such as would take them: As to
the English Men, I promis'd them to send them some Women from
England, with a good Cargo of Necessaries, if they would apply them-
selves to Planting, which I afterwards perform'd. And the Fellows
proved very honest and diligent after they were master'd, and had
their Properties set apart for them. I sent them also from the
Brasils five Cows, three of them being big with Calf, some
Sheep, and some Hogs, which, when I came again, were considerably
increas'd.
But all these things, with an Account how 300 Caribbea.
came and invaded them, and ruin'd their Plantations, and how they
fought with that whole Number twice, and were at first defeated, and
three of them killed; but at last a Storm destroying their Enemies'
Canoes, they famish'd or destroy'd almost all the rest, and renew'd
and recover'd the Possession of their Plantation, and still lived upon
the Island.
All these things, with some very surprising Incidents in some new
Adventures of my own, for ten Years more, I may perhaps give $
Carther Account of hereafter.

ROBINSON CRUSOE.
THE PREFACE.

HE Stucen t/.c fo/mer Part of this Work has
met with in the World, has yet been no other
than is acknowledg'd to be due to the surprising
Variety of the Subject, and to the agreeable
Manner of the Performance.
All the Endeavours of envious People to re-
proach it with being a Romance, to search it for Errors in Geography,
Inconsistency in the Relation, and Contradictions in the Fact, have proved
abortive, and as impotent as malicious.
The just Application of every Incident, the religious and useful In-
ferences drawn from every Part, are so many Testimonies to the good
Design of making it public, and must legitimate all the Part that may
if called Invention, or Parable in the Story.
The Second Part, if the Editor's Opinion may pass, is (contrary <c
the Usage of Second Parts,) every Hay as entertaining as the First,
contains as strange and surprising Incidents, and as great a Variety of
them; nor is the Application less serious, or suitable; and doubtless 'will,
to the sober, as well as ingenious Reader, be every way as profitable and
diverting; and this makes the abridging this Work, as scandalous, as it
is knavish and ridiculous; seeing, while to shorten the Book. that they
may seem to reduce the Value, they strip it cf all those Reflections, as
well religious as moral, which are not only the greatest Beauties of the
Work, but are calculated for the infinite Advantage of the Header.
By this they leave the Work naked of its brightest Ornaments; and
if they would, at the same Time pretend, that the Author has supply'd
the Story out of his Invention, they take from it the Improvement, which
alone recommends that Invention to wise and good Men.
The Injury these Men do the Proprietor of this Work, is a Practice
all honest Men abhor; and he believes he may challenge them to shew the
Difference between that and Robbing on the H'ghway, or Breaking open
a House.
If they can't shew any Difference in the Crime, they will find it hard
to shew why there should be any Difference in the Punishment: And
he will answer for it, that nothing shall be wanting on his Part, to do
them justice.

THE
FARTHER ADVENTURES
OF
ROBINSON CRUSOE, t*.

HAT homely Proverb used on so many Occasions
in England, viz. That what is bred in the Bone will
not go out of the Flesh, was never more verify'd,
than in the Story of my Life. Any one would
think, that after thirty-five Years' Affliction, and
a Variety of unhappy Circumstances, which few
Men, if any ever, went through before, and after
near seven Years of Peace and Enjoyment in the Fulness of all
Things; grown old, and when, if ever, it might be allowed me to
have had experience of every State of middle Life, and to know which
was most adapted to make a Man completely happy: I say, after all
this, any one would have thought that the native Propensity to
rambling, which I gave an Account of in my first Setting out into the
World, to have been so predominate in my Thoughts, should be worn
out, the volatile Part be fully evacuated, or at least condens'd, and I
might at 61 Years of Age have been a little inclin'd to stay at Home,
and have done venturing Life and Fortune any more-
Nay farther, the common Motive of foreign Adventures was taken
away in me; for I had no Fortune to make, I had nothing to seek:
If I had gained ten thousand Pound, I had been no richer; for I had
already sufficient for me, and for those I had to leave it to; and that
I had was visibly increasing; for having no great Family, I could not
spend the Income of what I had, unless I would set up for an expen-
sive Way of Living, such as a great Family, Servants, Equipage,
Gaiety, and the like, which were Things I had no Notion of, or In-
clination to; so that I had nothing indeed to do, but to sit still,
and fully erjoy what I had got, and see it increase daily upon my
Hands.
Yet all these Things had no Effect upon me, or at least, not
enough to resist the strong Inclination I had to go Abroad again,
which hung about me like a chronical Distemper; particularly the
Desire of seeing my new Plantation in the Island, and the Colony
I left there, run in my Head continually. I dreamed of it all
Night, and my Imagination run upon it all Day; it was uppermost
in all my Thoughts, and my Fancy worked so steadily and strongly
upon it, that I talked of it out of Sleep; in short, nothing could
remove it out of my Mind; it even broke so violently into all my
Discourses, that it made my Conversation tiresome; for I could
talk of nothing else, all my Discourse run into it, even to Imper-
tinence, and I saw it myself.
I have often heard Persons of good Judgment say, That all
the Stir People make in the World about Ghosts and Apparitions,
is owing to the Strength of Imagination, and the powerful Opera-
tion of Fancy in their Minds; that there is no such Thing as &
Spirit appearing, or a Ghost walking, and the like: That People's
poring affectionately upon the past Conversation of their deceas'd
Friends, so realizes it to them, that they are capable of fancying upon
some extraordinary Circumstances, that they see them; talk to them,
and are answered by them, when, in Truth, there is nothing but
Shadow and Vapour in the Thing; and they really know nothing of
the Matter.
For my Part, I know not to this Hour, whether there are any such
Things as real Apparitions, Spectres, or walking of People after the)
are dead, or whether there is anything in the Stories they tell us of
that Kind, more than the Product of Vapours, sick Minds, and wan-
dering Fancies; But this I know, that my Imagination worked up to
such a Height, and brought me into such Ecstasies of Vapours, or
what else I may call it, that I actually suppos'd myself, often-times
upon the Spot, at my old Castle behind the Trees; saw my old
Spaniard, Friday's Father, and the reprobate Sailors I left upon the
Island; nay, I fancy'd I talked with them, and looked at them so
steadily, though I was broad awake, as at Persons just before me;
and this I did till I often frighted myself with the Images my Fancy
represented to me: One Time in my Sleep I had the Villany of the
3 Pirate Sailors so lively related to me by the first Spaniard and
Friday's Father, that it was surprising; they told me how they bar-
barously attempted to murder all the Spaniards, and that they set Fire
to the Provisions they had laid up, on Purpose to distress and starve
them, Things that I had never heard of, and that indeed were never
all of them true in Fact: But it was so warm in my Imagination,
and so realiz'd to me, that to the Hour I saw them, I could not be
persuaded, but that it was or would be true; also how I resented
it, when the Spaniard complain'd to me, and how I brought them to
Justice, tried them before me, and order'd them all three to be hanged:
What there was really in this, shall be seen in its Place: For how-
ever I came to form such Things in my Dream, and what secret
Converse of Spirits injected it, yet there was very much of it true. I
say, I own that this Dream had nothing in it literally and specifi.
cally true: But the general Part was so true, the base villanous
Behaviour of these three harden'd Rogues was such, and had been so
much worse than all I can describe, that the Dream had too much
Similitude of the Fact, and as I would afterwards have punished
them severely ; so if I had hanged them all, I had been much in the
Right, and should have been justifiable both by the Laws of God
and Man.
But to return to my Story; in this Kind of Temper I had lived
some Years, I had no Enjoyment of my Life, no pleasant Hours, no
agreeable Diversion but what had something or other of this in it;
so that my Wife, who saw my Mind so wholly bent upon it, told me
very seriously one Night, That she believ'd there was some secret
powerful Impulse of Providence upon me, which had determin'd me
to go thither again; and that she found nothing hindered my going,
but my being engag'd to a Wife and Children. She told me that i:
was true she could not think of parting with me; but as she was
assur'd, that if she was dead, it would be the first Thing I would do:
So as it seemed to her, that the Thing was determin'd above, she
would not be the only Obstruction: for if I thought fit, and resolv'd
to go here she found me very intent upon her Words, and that I
looked very earnestly at her; so that it a little disorder'd her, and
she stopped. I asked her, Why she did not go on, and say out what
she was going to say? But I perceiv'd her Heart was too full, and
some Tears stood in her Eyes: Speak out, my Dear, said I. Are you
willing I should go? No, says she very affectionately, I am far from
willing: But if you are resolv'd to go, says she, and rather than I will
be the only Hindrance, I will go with you; for though I think it a
most preposterous Thing for one of your Years, and in your Condi-
tion, yet if it must be, said she, again weeping, I won't leave you; for
if it be of Heaven, you must do it There is no resisting it; and if
Heaven makes it your Duty to go, he will also make it mine to go
with you, or otherwise dispose of me, that I may not obstruct it
This affectionate Behaviour of my Wife's brought me a little out of
the Vapours, and I began to consider what I was a doing; I corrected
my wandering Fancy, and began to argue with myself sedately, what
Business I had after threescore Years, and after such a Life of
tedious Sufferings and Disasters, and closed in so happy and easy a
Manner, I say, what Business I had to rush into new Hazards, and
put myself upon Adventures, fit only for Youth and Poverty to run into.
With those Thoughts, I considered my new Engagement, that I
had a Wife, one Child born, and my Wife then great with Child of
another; that I had all the World could give me, and had no Need
to seek Hazards for Gain ; that I was declining in Years, and ought to
think rather of leaving what I had gained, than of seeking to increase
it; that as to what my Wife had said, of its being an Impulse from
Heaven, and that it should be my Duty to go, I had no Notion of
that; so after many of these Cogitations, I struggled with the Power
of my Imagination, reason'd myself out of it, as I believe People may
always do in like Cases, if they will; and, in a Word, I conquer'd it;
compos'd myself with such Arguments as occurr'd to my Thought,
and which my present Condition furnish'd me plentifully with, and
particularly, as the most effectual Method, I resolv'd to divert myself
with other Things, and to engage in some Business that might effec-
tually tie me up from any more Excursions of this Kind; for I found
that Thing return upon me chiefly when I was idle, had nothing to
do, or anything of Moment immediately before me.
To this Purpose I bought a little Farm in the County of Bedford,
and resolv'd to remove myself thither. I had a little convenient
House upon it, and the Land about it I found was capable of
great Improvement, and that it was many Ways suited to my Incli-
nation, which delighted in Cultivating, Managing, Planting, and Im-
proving of Land; and particularly, being an Inland Country, I was
remov'd from conversing among Ships, Sailors, and Things relating
to the remote Part of the World.
In a Word, I went down to my Farm, settled my Family, bought
me Ploughs, Harrows, a Cart, Waggon, Horses, Cows, Sheep; and
setting seriously to Work, became in one half Year, a mere Country
Gentleman; my Thoughts were entirely taken up in managing my
Servants, cultivating the Ground, Enclosing, Planting, cVv. and I
lived, as I thought, the most agreeable Life that Nature was capable
of directing, or that a Man always bred to Misfortunes was capable of
being retreated to.
I farmed upon my own Land, I had no Rent to pay, was limited
by no Articles; I could pull up or cut down as I pleased: What I
planted, was for myself, and what I improved, was for my Family;
and having thus left off the Thoughts of Wandering, I had not the
least Discomfort in any Part of Life, as to this World. Now I
thought indeed, that I enjoy'd the middle State of Life, that my
Father so earnestly recommended to me, and lived a kind of heavenly
Life, something like what is described by the Poet upon the Subject
of a Country Life.
Free from Pices, free from Care,
Age has no Pain, and Youth no Snare.
But in the Middle of all this Felicity, one Blow from unforeseen
Providence unhing'd me at once; and not only made a Breach upon
me inevitable and incurable, but drove me, by its Consequences, into
a deep Relapse into the wandering Disposition, which, as I may say,
being born in my very Blood, soon recover'd its hold of me, and like
the Returns of a violent Distemper, came on with an irresistible Force
upon me; so that nothing could make any more Impression upon me.
This Blow was the Loss of my Wife.
It is not my Business here to write an Elegy upon my Wife, give a
Character of her particular Virtues, and make my Court to the Sex
by the Flattery of a Funeral Sermon. She was, in a few Words, the
Y
Stay of all my Affairs, the Centre of all my Enterprises, the Engine,
that by her Prudence reduc'd me to that happy Compass I was in,
from the most extravagant and ruinous Project that flutter'd in my
Head, as above; and did more to guide my rambling Genius, than a
Mother's Tears, a Father's Instructions, a Friend's Counsel, or all my
own reasoning Powers could do. I was happy in listening to her
Tears, and in being moved by her Entreaties, and to the last Degree
desolate and dislocated in the World by the Loss of her.
When she was gone, the World looked awkwardly round me; I
was as much a Stranger in it, in my Thoughts, as I was in the Brasils,
when I went first on Shore there; and as much alone, except as
to the Assistance of Servants, as I was in my Island. I knew neither
what to do, or what not to do. I saw the World busy round me, one
Part labouring for Bread, and the other Part squandering in vile Ex-
cesses or empty Pleasures, equally miserable, because the End they
propos'd still fled from them; for the Man of Pleasure every Day
surfeited of his Vice, and heaped up Work for Sorrow and Repentance;
and the Men of Labour spent their Strength in daily Strugglings for
Bread to maintain the vital Strength they labour'd with, so living in
a daily Circulation of Sorrow, living but to work, and working but to
live, as if daily Bread were the only End of wearisome Life, and a
wearisome Life the only Occasion of daily Bread.
This put me in Mind of the Life, I lived in my Kingdom, the
Island; where I suffer'd no more Cor n to grow, because I did not
want it; and bred no more Goats, because I had no more Use forthem:
Where the Money lay in the Drawer till it grew mouldy, and had
scarce the Favour to be looked upon in 2o Years.
All these Things, had I improv'd them as I ought to have done,
and as Reason and Religion had dictated to me, would have taught
to me to search farther than human Enjoyments for a full Felicity,
and that there was something which certainly was the Reason and End
of Life, superior to all these Things, and which was either to be pos-
sess'd, or at least hoped for on this Side the Grave.
But my Sage Counsellor was gone, I was like a Ship without a
Pilot, that could only run afore the Wind: My Thoughts ran all
away again into the old Affair, my Head quite was turned with the
Whimsies of foreign Adventures, and all the pleasant innocent
Amusements of my Farm, and my Garden, my Cattle, and rny
Family, which before entirely possess'd me, were nothing to me, had
no Relish, and were like Music to one that has no Ear, or Food to
one that has no Taste: In a Word, I resolv'd to leave off House-
keeping, let my Farm, and return to London; and in a few Months
after, I did so.
When I came to London, I was still as uneasy as I was before, I
had no Relish to the Place, no Employment in it, nothing to do but
to saunter about like an idle Person, of whom it may be said, he is
perfectly useless in God's Creation; and it is not one Farthing Mat-
ter to the rest of his Kind, whether he be dead or alive. This also
was the Life, which of all Circumstances of Life was the most my
Aversion, who had been all my Days used to an active Life; and I
would often say to myself, A State of Idleness is the very Dregs of Life;
and indeed I thought I was much more suitably employ'd, when I
was 26 Days making me a Deal Board.
It was now the Beginning of the Year 1693, when my Nephew,
whom as I had observ'd before I had brought up to the Sea, and had
made him Commander of a Ship, was come Home from a short
Voyage to BUboa, being the first he had made; and he came to me
and told me, that some Merchants of his Acquaintance had been pro-
posing to him to go a Voyage for them to the East Indies and to
China, as private Traders: And now Uncle, says he, if you will go to
Sea with me, I'll engage toland you upon your old Habitation in the
Island, for we are to touch at the Brasils.
Nothing can be a greater Demonstration of a future State, and of
the Existence of an invisible World, than the Concurrence of second
Causes, with the Ideas of Things, which we form in our Minds, per-
fectly reserv'd, and not communicated to any in the World.
My Nephew knew nothing how far my Distemper of wandering was
return'd upon me, and I knew nothing of what he had in his Thoughts
to say, when that very Morning before he came to me, I had a great
deal of Confusion of Thought, and revolving every Part of my Cir-
cumstances in my Mind, came to this Resolution, viz. That I would
go to Lisbon, and consult with my old Sea-Captain; and so if it was
rational and practicable, I would go and see the Island again, and
see what was become of my People there. I had pleased myself
with the Thoughts of peopling the Place, and carrying Inhabitants
from hence, getting a Patent for the Possession, and I know not what;
when in the Middle of all this, in comes my Nephew, as I have said,
with his Project of carrying me thither, in his Way to the East-Indies,
I paused a while at his Words, and looking steadily at him, What
Devil, said I, sent you of this unlucky Errand? My Nephew startled
as if he had been frighted at first; but perceiving I was not much
displeas'd with the Proposal, he recover'd himself. I hope it may
not be an unlucky Proposal, Sir, says he, I daresay you would be
pleased to see your new Colony there, where you once reigned
with more Felicity, than most of your Brother Monarchs in the World.
In a Word, the Scheme hit so exactly with my Temper, that is to
say, the Prepossession I was under, and of which I have said so
much, that I told him in few Words, if he agreed with the Mer-
chants, I would go with him: But I told him, I would not promise
to go any farther than my own Island. Why Sir, says he, you don't
want to be left there again, I hope? Why, said I, can you not take
me up again in your Return? He told me, it could not be possible,
that the Merchants would allow him to come that Way with a loaded
Ship of such value, it being a Month's Sail out of his Way, and
might be three or four: Besides, Sir, if I should miscarry, said he,
and not return at all, then you would be just reduced to the Con-
dition you were in before.
This was very rational; but we both found out a Remedy for it,
which was to carry a framed Sloop on board the Ship, which being taken
in Pieces, and shipped on board the Ship, might by the Help of some
Carpenters, whom we agreed to carry with us, be set up again in the
Island, and finish'd, fit to go to Sea in a few Days.
I was not long resolving; for indeed the Importunities of my
Nephew joined in so effectually with my Inclination, that nothing
could oppose me: On the other Hand, my Wife being dead, I had
nobody concern'd themselves so much for me, as to persuade me one
way or other, except my ancient good Friend the Widow, who
earnestly struggled with me to consider my Years, my easy Circum-
stances, and the needless Hazards of a long Voyage; and above all,
my young Children: But it was all to no Purpose, I had an irresis-
tible Desire to the Voyage; and I told her, I thought there was some-
thing so uncommon in the Impressions I had upon my Mind for the
Voyage, that it would be a kind of resisting Providence, if I should
attempt to stay at Home; after which, she ceased her Expostulations,
and joined with me, not only in making Provision for my Voyage,
but also in settling my Family Affairs for my Absence, and pro-
viding for the Education of my Children.
In Order to this, I made my Will, and settled the Estate I had, in
rach a Manner for my Children, and placed in such Hands, that I
was perfectly easy and satisfy'd they would have Justice done'them,
whatever might befal me; and for their Education, I left it wholly to
my Widow, with a sufficient Maintenance to herself for her Care:
All which she richly deserv'd; for no Mother could have taken more
Care in their Education, or understood it better; and as she lived
till I came Home, I also lived to thank her for it
My Nephew was ready to sail about the Beginning of January
1694-5, and I with my Man Friday went on board in the Downs the
8th, having besides that Sloop which I mention'd above, a very consider-
able Cargo of all Kinds of necessary Things for my Colony, which if
I did not find in good Condition, I resolv'd to leave so.
First, I carry'd with me some Servants, whom I purposed to place
there, as Inhabitants, or at least to set on Work there upon my own
Account while I stayed, and either to leave them there, or carry
them forward as they should appear willing; particularly, I carry'd
two Carpenters, a Smith, and a very handy ingenious Fellow, who was a
Cooper by Trade but was also a general Mechanic; for he was
dexterous at making Wheels, and Hand-Mills to grind Corn, was a
good Turner, and a good Pot-Maker; he also made anything that
was proper to make of Earth, or of Wood; in a Word, we called him
Our Jack of all Trades.
With these I carry'd a Tailor, who had offer'd himself to go Pas-
senger to the East Indies with my Nephew, but afterwards consented
to stay on our New Plantation, and proved a most necessary handy
Fellow, as could be desir'd, in many other Businesses, besides that ol
his Trade; for as I observ'd formerly, Necessity arms us for all Em-
ployments.
My Cargo, as near as I can collect, for I have not kept an Account
of the Particulars, consisted of a sufficient Quantity of Linen, and
some thin English Stuffs for clothing the Spaniards that I expected
to find there, and enough of them, as by my Calculation might com-
fortably supply them for seven Years; If I remember right, the
Materials I carried for clothing them with, Gloves, Hats, Shoes,
Stockings, and all such Things as they could want for wearing,
amounted to above 200 Pounds, including some Beds, Bedding, and
Household Stuff, particularly Kitchen Utensils, with Pots, Kettles,
Pewter, Brass, 6v. and near a hundred Pound more in Ironwork,
Nails, Tools of every Kind, Staples, Hooks, Hinges, and every neces-
sary Thing I could think of.
I carry'd also an hundred spare Arms, Muskets, and Fuzees, besides
some Pistols, a considerable Quantity of Shot of all Sizes, and two
Pieces of Brass Cannon; and because I knew not what Time, and
what Extremities I was providing for, I carry'd an hundred Barrels
of Powder, besides Swords, Cutlasses, and the Iron Part of some
Pikes, and Halberts; so that in short we had a large Magazine of all
Sorts of Stores; and I made my Nephew carry two small Quarter-
Deck Guns more than he wanted for his Ship, to leave behind, if
there was Occasion; that when we came there, we might build a Fort,
and man it against all Sorts of Enemies: And indeed, I at first thought
there was Need enough for it all, and much more, if we hoped to
maintain our Possession of the Island, as shall be seen in the Course
of that Story.
I had not such bad Luck in this Voyage as I had been used to
meet with; and therefore shall have the less Occasion to interrupt
the Reader, who perhaps may be impatient to hear how Matters went
with my Colony; yet some odd Accidents, cross Winds, and bad
Weather happen'd, on this first setting out, which made the Voyage
longer than I expected it at first; and I who had never made but one
Voyage, (viz.) my first Voyage to Guinea, in which I might be said \f\
come back again, as the Voyage was at first design'd, began to think
the same ill Fate still attended me; and that I was born to be never
contented with being on Shore, and yet to be always unfortunate at Sea.
Contrary Winds first put us to the Northward, and we were oblig'd
to put in at Galway in Ireland, where we lay Wind-bound two-and-
twenty Days; but we had this Satisfaction with the Disaster, that
Provisions were here exceeding cheap, and in the utmost Plenty; so
that while we lay here, never touch'd the Ship's Stores, but rather
added to them; here also I took in several live Hogs, and two Cows, and
Calves, which I resolv'd, if I had a good Passage, to put on Shore in
my Island, but we found Occasion to dispose otherwise of them.
We set out the 5th of February from Ireland and had a very fair
Gale of Wind for some Days; as I remember, it might be about the
aoth of February in the Evening late, when the Mate having the
Watch, came into the Round-house, and told us, he saw a Flash of
Fire, and heard a Gun fired, and while he was telling us of it, a Boy
came in, and told us the Boatswain heard another. This made us all
1 an out upon the Quarter-Deck, where for a while we heard nothing,
but in a few Minutes we saw a very great Light, and found that there
was some very terrible Fire at a Distance; immediately we had
Recourse to our Reckonings, in which we all agreed, that there could
be no Land that Way, in which the Fire shewed itself, no not for 500
Leagues, for it appear'd at W.N.W. Upon this we concluded it
must be some Ship on Fire at Sea; and as by our hearing the Noise
of Guns just before, we concluded it could not be far off: We stood
directly towards it, and were presently satisfy'd we should discover it,
because the farther we sailed, the greater the Light appear'd, though
the Weather being hazy, we could not perceive anything but the
Light for a while; in about half an Hour's Sailing, the Wind being
fair for us, though not much of it, and the Weather clearing up a little,
we could plainly discern that it was a great Ship on Fire in the Middle
of the Sea.
I was most sensibly touched with this Disaster, though not at all
acquainted with the Persons engag'd in it; I presently recollected
my former Circumstances, and in what Condition I was in, when taken
up by the Portugal Captain; and how much more deplorable the
Circumstances of the poor Creatures belonging to this Ship must be,
if they had no other Ship in Company with them: Upon this, I im-
mediately order^, that five Guns should be fired, one soon after
another, that, if possible, we might give Notice to them, that there
was Help for them at hand, and that they might endeavour to save
themselves in their Boat; for though we could see the Flame of the
Ship, yet they, it being Night, could see nothing of us.
We lay by some Time upon this, only driving as the burning Ship
drove, waiting for Daylight; when, on a sudden, to our great Terror,
though we had Reason to expect it, the Ship blew up in the Air; and
immediately, that is to say, in a few Minutes, all the Fire was out,
that is to say, the rest of the Ship sunk: This was a terrible, and
indeed an afflicting Sight, for the Sake of the poor Men, who, I con-
cluded, must be either all destroy'd in the Ship, or be in the utmost
Distress in their Boat in the Middle of the Ocean, which at present,
by Reason it was dark, I could not see: However, to direct them as
well as I could, I caused Lights to be hung out in all the Parts of the
Ship where we could, and which we had Lanterns for, and kept firing
Guns all the Night long, letting them know by this, that there was a
Snip not far off.
About 8 o'Clock in the Morning we discover'd the Ship's Boats by
the Help of our Perspective Glasses, and found thsre were two of
them, both thronged with People, and deep in the Water: We per-
ceiv'd they rowed, the Wind being against them, that they saw our
Ship, and did their utmost to make us see them.
We immediately spread our Ancient to let them know we saw them,
and hung a Waft out as a Signal for them to come on Board, and then
made more Sail, standing directly to them. In little more than half
an Hour we came up with them, and, in a word, took them all in,
being no less than sixty-four Men, Women, and Children; for there
were a great many Passengers.
Upon the whole, we found it was a French Merchant Ship of 300
Ton, homeward bound from Quebec, in the River of Canada. The
Master gave us a long Account of the Distress of his Ship, how the
Fire began in the Steerage by the Negligence of the Steersman; but
on his crying out for Help, was, as everybody thought, entirely put
out, when they found that some Sparks of the first Fire had gotten
into some Part of the Ship, so difficult to come at, that they could
not effectually quench it, till getting in between the Timbers, and
within the Ceiling of the Ship, it proceeded into the Hold, and
master'd all the Skill, and all the Application they were able to
exert
They had no more to do then, but to get into their Boats, which to
their great Comfort were pretty large, being their Longboat, and a
great Shallop, besides a small Skiff which was of no great Service to
them, other than to get some fresh Water and Provisions into her,
after they had secur'd their Lives from the Fire. They had indeed
tmall Hope of their Lives by getting into these Boats at that Distance
from any Land, only as they said well, that they were escap'd from
the Fire, and had a Possibility that some Ship might happen to be at
Sea, and might take them in. They had Sails, Oars, and a Compass,
and were preparing to make the best of their Way back to Newfound-
land, the Wind blowing pretty fair, for it blew an easy Gale at S.E.
by E. They had as much Provisions and Water, as with sparing it
so as to be next door to starving, might support them about 11 Days;
in which, if they had no bad Weather, and no contrary Winds, the
Captain said, he hoped he might get the Banks of Newfoundland, and
might perhaps take some Fish to sustain them till they might go on
Shore. But there were so many Chances against diem in all these
Cases; such as, Storms to overset and founder them, Rains and Cold
to benumb and perish their Limbs, contrary Winds to keep them out
and starve them, that it must have been next to miraculous if they
had escap'd.
In the midst of their Consultations, every one being hopeless, and
ready to despair, the Captain with Tears in his Eyes told me, they
were on a sudden surpris'd with the Joy of hearing a Gun fire, and
after that four more; these were the five Guns which I caused to be
fired at first seeing the Light: This reviv'd their Hearts, and gave
them the Notice, which, as above, I desir'd it should, (viz.) that there
was a Ship at hand for their Help.
It was upon the hearing these Guns, that they took down their Masts
and Sails; the Sound coming from the Windward, they resolv'd to lie
by till Morning. Some Time after this, hearing no more Guns, they
fired three Muskets, one a considerable While after another; but
these, the Wind being contrary, we never heard.
Some Time after that again, they were still more agreeably surpris'd
with seeing our Lights, and hearing the Guns, which, as I have said,
I caused to be fired all the rest of the Night; this set them to work
with their Oars, to keep their Boats a-head, at least, that we might
the sooner come up with them; and at last, to their inexpressible Joy,
they found we saw them.
It is impossible for me to express the several Gestures, the strange
Ecstasies, the Variety of Postures which these poor deliver'd People
run into, to express the Joy of their Souls at so unexpected a Delive-
rance; Grief and Fear are easily described; Sighs, Tears, Groans,
and a very few Motions of the Head and Hands make up the Sum of
its Variety: But an Excess of Joy, a Surprise of Joy, has a Thousand
Extravagances in it; there were some in Tears, some raging, and
tearing themselves, as if they had been in the greatest Agonies of
Sorrow, some stark-raving and downright lunatic, some ran about the
Ship stamping with their Feet, others wringing their Hands; some
were dancing, some singing, some laughing, more crying; many quite
dumb, not able to speak a Word; others sick and vomiting, several
swooning, and ready to faint; and a few were crossing themselves,
and giving God Thanks.
I would not wrong them neither, there might be many that were
thankful afterward, but the Passion was too strong for them at first,
tnd they were not able to master it, they were thrown into Ecstasies
-md a Kind of Frenzy, and it was but a very few that were compos'd
and serious in their Joy.
Perhaps the Case may have some Addition to it from the particular
Circumstance of that Nation they belong'd to, I mean the Frmch,
whose Temper is allow'd to be more volatile, more passionate, and
more sprightly, and their Spirits more fluid than in other Nations. I
am not Philosopher enough to determine the Cause, but nothing I
had ever seen before came up to it: The Ecstasies poor Friday, my
trusty Savage, was in when he found his Father in the Boat, came the
nearest to it, and the Surprise of the Master and his two Companions
whom I deliver'd from the Villains that set them on Shore in the Island,
came a little Way towards it, but nothing was to compare to this,
either that I saw in Friday, or anywhere else in my Life.
It is further observable, that these Extravagancies did not show
themselves in that different Manner I have mention'd in different
Persons only: But all the Variety would appear in a short Succession
of Moments in one and the same Person. A Man that we saw this
Minute dumb, and as it were stupid and confounded, should the next
Minute be dancing and hallooing like an Antic; and the next Moment
be tearing his Hair, or pulling his Clothes to Pieces, and stamping
Jiem under his Feet, like a Madman; and a few Moments after that,
we should have him all in Tears, then sick, then swooning; and had
not immediate Help been had, would, in a few Moments more have
been dead; and thus it was not with one or two, or ten or twenty,
but with the greatest Part of them; and if I remember right, our
Surgeon was oblig'd to let above thirty of them Blood.
There were two Priests among them, one an old Man, and the
other a young Man; and that which was strangest was, that the oldest
Man was the worst As soon as he set his Foot on board our Ship,
and saw himself safe, he dropped down stone-dead, not the least Sign
of Life could be perceiv'd in him; our Surgeon immediately appl/d
proper Remedies to recover him, and was the only Man in the Ship
that believ'd he was not dead: at length he opened a Vein in his
Arm, having first chafed and rubbed the Part so as to warm it as
much as possible: Upon this the Blood which only dropped at first,
flowed something freely; in three Minutes after, the Man open'd his
Eyes, and about a quarter of an Hour after that he spoke, grew
better, and quite well; after the Blood was stopped, he walked
about, told us he was perfectly well, took a Dram of Cordial
whicn the Surgeon gave him, and was what we called, Come to
Himself; about a quarter of an Hour after they came running into
the Cabin to the Surgeon, who was bleeding a French Woman, that
had fainted ; and told him, the Priest was gone stark mad; it seems he
had begun to revolve the Change of his Circumstance, and again this
put him into an Ecstasy of Joy, his Spirits whirled about faster than
ihe Vessels could convey them; the Blood grew hot and feverish,
and the Man was as fit for Bedlam, as any Creature that ever was in
it; the Surgeon would not bleed him again in that Condition, but
gave him something to doze and put him to sleep, which after some
Time operated upon him, and he waked the next Morning perfectly
compos'd, and well.
The younger Priest behav'd with great Command of his Passion,
and was really an Example of a serious well-govern'd Mind; at his
first coming on board the Ship, he threw himself flat on his Face,
prostrating himself in Thankfulness for his Deliverance, in which I
unhappily and unseasonably disturb'd him, really thinking he had
been in a Swoon; but he spake calmly, thanked me, told me, he was
giving God Thanks for his Deliverance, and begged me to leave him
a few Moments, and that next to his Maker he would give me Thanks
also.
I was heartily sorry, that I disturb'd him, and not only left him, but
kept others from interrupting him also; he continued in that Posture
about three Minutes, or little more, after I left him, then came to me,
as he had said he would, and with a great deal of Seriousness and
Affection, but with Tears in his Eyes, thanked me that had under
God, given him and so many miserable Creatures their Lives: I told
him, I had no Room to move him to thank God for it, rather than
me: But I added, That it was nothing but what Reason and Humanity
dictated to all Men, and that we had as much Reason as he to give
Thanks to God, who had blessed us so far as to make us the Instru-
ments of his Mercy to so many of his Creatures.
After this, the young Priest apply'd himself to his Country-Folks,
labour'd to compose them; persuaded, entreated, argued, reason'd
with them, and did his utmost to keep them within the Exercise of
their Reason; and with some he had Success, though others were for
a Time out of all Government of themselves.
I cannot help committing this to Writing, as perhaps it may be
useful to those into whose Hands it may fall, for the guiding them-
selves in all the Extravagances of their Passions; for if an Excess of
Joy can carry Men out to such a length beyond the Reach of theii
Reason, what will not the Extravagances of Anger, Rage, and a prc-
vok'd Mind, carry us to? and indeed here I saw Reason for keeping
an exceeding Watch over our Passions of every Kind, as well those
of Joy and Satisfaction, as those of Sorrow and Anger.
We were something disordered by these Extravagances among oui
new Guests for the first Day, but when they had been retired, Lodgings
provided for them as well as our Ship would allow, and they had
slept heartily, as most of them did, they were quite another Sort oi
People the next Day.
Nothing of good Manners or civil Acknowledgments for the Kind-
ness shown them was wanting; the French, it is known, are naturally
apt to exceed that Way. The Captain and one of the Priests came to
me the next Day, and desiring to speak with me and my Nephew,
the Commander, began to consult with us what should be done with
them; and first they told us, that as we had saved their Lives, so all
they had was little enough for a Return to us for that Kindness re-
ceived. The Captain said, they had saved some Money and some
Things of Value in their Boats, caught hastily out of the Flames,
and if we would accept it, they were ordered to make an Offer of it
all to us; they only desired to be set on Shore somewhere in our
Way, where if possible they might get Passage to France.
My Nephew was for accepting their Money at first Word, and to
consider what to do with them afterwards; but I overrul'd him in
that Part, for I knew what it was to be set on Shore in a strange
Country; and if the Portugal Captain that took me up at Sea had
served me so, and took all I had for my Deliverance, I must have
starved, or have been as much a Slave at the Brasils as I had been
in Barbary, the mere being sold to a Mahometan excepted; and
perhaps a Portuguese is not much a better Master than a Turk, if not
in some Cases a much worse.
I therefore told the French Captain that we had taken them up in
their Distress, it was true; but that it was our Duty to do so as we
were Fellow-Creatures, and as we would desire to be so deliver'd if
we were in the like or any other Extremity; that we had done
nothing for them but what we believed they would have done for us,
if we had been in their Case, and they in ours; but that we took
them up to save them, not to plunder them; and it would be a most
barbarous thing to take that little from them which they saved out of
the Fire, and then set them on Shore and leave them; that this
would be first to save them from Death, and then kill them our-
selves; save them from drowning, and abandon them to starving;
and therefore I would not let the least thing be taken from them:
As to setting them on Shore, I told them indeed that was an exceed-
ing Difficulty to us, for that the Ship was bound to the East Indies;
and though we were driven out of our Course to the Westward a very
great Way, and perhaps were directed by Heaven on Purpose for their
Deliverance, yet it was impossible for us wilfully to change our Voyage
on this particular Account, nor could my Nephew, the Captain,
answer it to the Freighters, with whom he was under Charter-Party to
pursue his Voyage by the Way of Brasil, and all I knew we could do
for them, was to put ourselves in the Way of meeting with other Ships
homeward bound from the West Indies, and get them Passage, if pos-
sible, to England or France.
The first Part of the Proposal was so generous and kind, they could
not but be very thankful for it; but they were in a very great Con-
sternation, especially the Passengers, at the Notion of being carry'd
away to the East Indies, and they then entreated me, that seeing I
was driven so far to the Westward, before I met with them, I would
at least keep on the same Course to the Banks of Newfoundland,
where it was probable I might meet with some Ship or Sloop that
they might hire to carry them back to Canada, from whence they
came.
I thought this was but a reasonable Request on their Part, and
therefore I inclin'd to agree to it; for indeed I consider'd, that to carry
this whole Company to the East Indies, would not only be an intole-
rable Severity upon the poor People, but would be ruining our whole
Voyage by devouring all our Provisions; so 1 thought it no Breach
of Charter-Party, but what an unforeseen Accident made absolutely
necessary to us, and in which no one could say we were to blame;
for the Laws of God and Nature would have forbid that we should
refuse to take up two Boats full of People in such a distress'd Condi-
tion, and -the Nature of the Thing as well respecting ourselves as
the poor People, oblig'd us to set them on Shore somewhere or other
for their Deliverance; so I consented that we would carry them to
Newfoundland, if Wind and Weather would permit, and if not, that I
would carry them to Martinico in the West Indies.
The Wind continued fresh Easterly, but the Weather pretty good,
and as the Winds had continued in the Points between N.E. and
S.E. a long time, we missed several Opportunities of sending them
to France; for we met several Ships bound to Europe, whereof two
were French from St Christopher's, but they had been so long beating
up against the Wind, that they durst take in no Passengers for fear of
wanting Provisions for the Voyage, as well for themselves as for those
they should take in; so we were obliged to go on. It was about a
Week after this that we made the Banks of Navfoundland, where to
shorten my Story, we put all our French People on Board a Bark,
which they hired at Sea there, to put them on Shore, and afterwards
to carry them to France if they could get Provision to victual them-
selves with. When, I say, all the French went on Shore, I should
remember that the young Priest I spoke of, hearing we were bound
to the East Indies, desired to go the Voyage with us, and to be set
on Shore on the Coast of Coromandel, which I readily agreed to, for
I wonderfully liked the Man, and had very good Reason, as will
appear afterwards; also four of the Seamen entered themselves on our
Ship, and proved very useful fellows.
From hence we directed our Course for the West Indies, steering
away S. and S. by E. for about twenty Days together, sometimes little
or no Wind at all, when we met with another Subject for our Hu-
manity to work upon, almost as deplorable as that before.
It was in the Latitude of 27 Degrees 5 Minutes North, and the
19th Day of March 1694-5, when we spied a Sail, our Course S.E
and by S. We soon perceiv'd it was a large Vessel, and that she bore
up to us, but could not at first know what to make of her, till after
coming a little nearer, we found she had lost her Maintop-mast, Fore-
mast and Boltsprit, and presently she fired a Gun as a Signal of
Distress; the Weather was pretty good, Wind at N.N.W. a fresh
Gale, and we s6on came to speak with her.
We found her a Ship of Bristol, bound home from Barbadoes, but
had been blown out of the Road at Barbadoes a few Days before she
was ready to sail, by a terrible Hurricane, while the Captain and
Chief Mate were both gone on Shore, so that beside the Terror of
the Storm, they were but in an indifferent Case for good Artists to
bring the Ship home: They had been already nine Weeks at Sea,
and had met with another terrible Storm after the Hurricane was overi
which had blown them quite out of their Knowledge to the Westward)
and in which they lost their Masts, as above; they told us they
expected to have seen the Bahama Islands, but were then driven
away again to the South-East by a strong Gale of Wind at N.N.W.
the same that blew now, and having no Sails to work the Ship with
but a main Course, and a kind of square Sail upon a Jury Foremast,
which they had set up, they could not lie near the Wind, but were
endeavouring to stand away for the Canaries.
But that which was worst of all, was, that they were almost starved foi
want of Provisions, besides the Fatigues they had undergone; their
Bread and Flesh was quite gone, they had not one Ounce left in the
Ship, and had had none for eleven Days; the only Relief they had,
was, their Water was not all spent, and they had about half a Barrel
of Flour left; they had Sugar enough; some Succades or Sweet-
meats they had at first, but they were devour'd, and they had seven
Casks of Rum.
There was a Youth and his Mother and a Maid-Servant on Board,
who were going Passengers, and thinking tlie Ship was ready to sail,
unhappily came on Board the Evening before the Hurricane began,
and having no Provisions of their own left, they were in a more de-
plorable Condition than the rest, for the Seamen being reduced to
such an extreme Necessity themselves, had no Compassion, we may
be sure, for the poor Passengers, and they were indeed in a Condi-
tion that their Misery is very hard to describe.
I had, perhaps, not known this Part, if my Curiosity had not led
me, the Weather being fair and the Wind abated, to go on Board the
Ship: The Second Mate who upon this Occasion commanded the
Ship, had been on Board our Ship, and he told me indeed they had
three Passengers in the great Cabin, that were in a deplorable Con-
dition; nay, says he, I believe they are dead, for I have heard
nothing of them for above two Days, and I was afraid to inquire after
them, said he, for I had nothing to relieve them with.
We immediately apply'd ourselves to give them what Relief we
could spare; and indeed I had so far overruled Things with my
Nephew, that I would have victuall'd them, though we had gone
away to Virginia, or any Part of the Coast of America, to have sup-
ply'd ourselves, but there was no Necessity for that
But now they were in a new Danger; for they were afraid of
eating too much, even of that little we gave them; the Mate or
Commander brought six Men with bim in his Boat, but these poor
Wretches looked like Skeletons, and were so weak, they could hardlj
sit to their Oars: The Mate himself was very ill, and half starved;
for he declar'd he had reserv'd nothing from the Men, and went
Share and Share alike with them in every Bit they eat
I caution'd him to eat sparingly, but set Meat before him imme-
diately, and he had not eaten three Mouthfuls before he began to be
Sick, and out of Order; so he stopped a while, and our Surgeon
mixed him up something with some Broth, which he said would be to
him both Food and Physic; and after he had taken it, he grew better:
In the meantime, I forgot not the Men; I order'd Victuals to be
given them, and the poor Creatures rather devour^ than eat it; they
were so exceeding hungry, that they were in a kind ravenous, and had
no Command of themselves; and two of them eat with so much
Greediness, that they were in Danger of their Lives the next
Morning.
The Sight of these People's Distress was very moving to me, and
brought to Mind what I had a terrible Prospect of at my first coming
on Shore in the Island, where I had neither the least Mouthful of
Food, or any Prospect of procuring any; besides the hourly Appre-
hension I had of behlg made the Food of other Creatures: But all
rhe while the Mate was thus relating to me the miserable Conditio*
of the Ship's Company, I could not put out of my Thought the Story
he had told me of the three poor Creatures in the Great Cabin, (viz.)
the Mother, her Son, and the Maid-servant, whom he had heard
nothing of for two or three Days, and whom he seemed to confess
they had wholly neglected, their own Extremities being so great; by
which I understood, that they had really given them no Food at all,
and that therefore they must be perish'd, and be all lying dead per-
haps on the Floor, or Deck of the Cabin.
As I therefore kept the Mate, whom we then called Captain, on
board with his Men to refresh them, so I also forgot not the
starving Crew that were left on board, but order'd my own Boat
to go on board the Ship, and with my Mate and twelve Men to
carry them a Sack of Bread, and four or five Pieces of Beef to
boil. Our Surgeon charged the Men to cause the Meat to be
boiled while they stayed, and to keep Guard in the Cook-Room,
to prevent the Men taking it to eat raw, or taking it out of the
Pot before it was well bciled, and then to give every Man but a
very little at a Time; and by this Caution he preserv'd the Men,
who would otherwise have killed themselves with that very Food
that was given them on Purpose to save their Lives.
At the same Time, I order'd the Mate to go into the Great
Cabin, and see what Condition the poor Passengers were in, and
if they were alive, to comfort them, and give them what Refresh-
ment was proper; and the Surgeon gave him a large Pitcher with
some of the prepar'd Broth which he had given the Mate that was
on board, and which he did not question would restore them
gradually.
I was not satisfy'd with this, but as I said above, having a great
Mind to see the Scene of Misery, which I knew the Ship itself would
present me with, in a more lively Manner than I could have it by Re-
port, I took the Captain of the Ship, as we now called him, with me,
and went myself a little after in their Boat
I found the poor Men on board almost in a Tumult to get the
Victuals out of the Boiler before it was ready: But my Mate observ'd
his Order, and kept a good Guard at the Cook-Room Door, and the
Man he placed there, after using all possible Persuasion to have
Patience, kept them off by Force: However, he caused some Biscuit
Cakes to be dipped in the Pot, and soften'd with the Liquor of the
Meat, which they call Brews, and gave them every one, one, to stay
their Stomachs, and told them it was for their own Safety that he was
oblig'd to give them but a little at Time: But it was all in vain; and
had I not come on board, and their own Commander and Officers
with me, and with good Words, and some Threats also of giving them
so more, I believe they would have broke into the Cook-Room by
Force, and tore the Meat out of the Furnace: For Words are indeed
of very small Force to a hungry Belly: However, we pacify'd them,
and fed them gradually and cautiously for the first Time, and the
next Time gave them more, and at last filled their Bellies, and the
Men did well enough.
But the Misery of the poor Passengers in the Cabin, was of
another Nature, and far beyond the rest; for as first the Ship's Com-
pany had so little for themselves, it was but too true that they had at
first kept them very low, and at last totally neglected them; so that
for six or seven Days, it might be said, they had really had no Food
at all, and for several Days before very little. The poor Mother, who
as the Men reported, was a Woman of good Sense and good Breed-
ing, had spared all she could get, so affectionately for her Son, that
at last she entirely sunk under it: And when the Mate o( our Ship
went in, she sat upon the Floor or Deck, with her Back up against
the Sides, between two Chairs, which were lashed fast, and her Head
sunk in between her Shoulders, like a Corpse, though not quite dead,
My Mate said all he could to revive and encourage her, and with a
Spoon put some Broth into her Mouth; she open'd her Lips, and
lifted up one Hand, but could not speak; yet she understood what
he said, and made Signs to him, intimating, that it was too late for
her, but pointed to her Child, as if she would have said, they should
take Care of him.
However, the Mate, who was exceedingly moved with the Sight,
endeavour'd to get some of the Broth into her Mouth; and as he
said, got two or three Spoonfuls down, though I question whether
he could be sure of it or not: But it was too late, and she died the
same Night
The Youth, who was preserved at the Price of his most affectionate
Mother's Life, was not so far gone, yet he lay in a Cabin-bed as one
stretched out, with hardly any Life left in him; he had a Piece of an
old Glove in his Mouth, having eaten up the rest of it; however,
being young, and having more Strength than his Mother, the
Mate got something down his Throat, and he began sensibly
to revive, though by giving him some time after but two or three
Spoonfuls extraordinary, he was very sick, and brought it up
again.
But the next Care was the poor Maid, she lay all along upon the
Deck hard by her Mistress, and just like one that had fallen down
with an Apoplexy and struggled for Life: Her Limbs were distorted,
one of her Hands was clasped round the Frame of a Chair, and she
griped it so hard, that we could not easily make her let go; her other
Arm lay over her Head, and her Feet lay both together set fast against
the Frame of the Cabin Table; in short, she lay just like one in the
last Agonies of Death, and yet she was alive too.
The poor Creature was not only starved with Hunger, and terrify'd
with the Thoughts of Death, but as the Men told us afterwards,
was broken-hearted for her Mistress, whom she saw dying for two or
three Days before, and whom she loved most tenderly.
We knew not what to do with this poor Girl, or when our Surgeon,
who was a Man of very great Knowledge and Experience, had with
great Application recover'd, her as to Life; he had her upon his Hand
AS to her Senses, for she was little less than distracted for a consider-
able Time after, as shall appear presently.
Whoever shall read these Memorandums must be desir'd to consider,
that Visits at Sea are not like a Journey into the Country, where some-
times People stay a Week or a Fortnight at a Place. Our Business was
to relieve this distressed Ship's Crew, but not to lie by for them; and
though they were willing to steer the same Course with us for some
Days, yet we could carry no Sail to keep Pace with a Ship that had
no Masts; however, as their Captain begged of us to help him to set
up a Maintop-mast, and a Kind of a Top-mast to his Jury Fore-
mast We did, as it were, lie by him for three or four Days, and then
having given him five Barrels of Beef, a Barrel of Pork, two
Hogsheads of Biscuit, and a Proportion of Peas, Flour, and what
other Things we could spare; and taking three Casks of Sugar, some
Rum, and some Pieces of Eight of them for Satisfaction, we left
them, taking on board with us, at their own earnest Request, the
Priest, the Youth, and the Maid, and all their Goods.
The young Lad was about seventeen Years of Age, a pretty, well-
bred, modest, and sensible Youth, greatly dejected with the Loss of
his Mother, and as it seems had lost his Father but a few Months
before at Barbadoes. He begged of the Surgeon to speak to me to
take him out of the Ship, for he said the cruel Fellows had murder'd
his Mother; and indeed so they had, that is to say passively; for they
might have spared a small Sustenance to the poor helpless Widow,
that might have preserved her Life, though it had been but just to keep
her alive. But Hunger knows no Friend, no Relation, no Justice, no
Right, and therefore is remorseless, and capable of no Compassion.
The Surgeon told him how far we were going, and how it would
carry him away from all his Friends, and put him perhaps in as bad
Circumstances almost as those we found him in; that is to say, starv-
ing in the World. He said it matter'd not whither he went, if he
was but delivered from the terrible Crew he was among: That the
Captain (by which he meant me, for he could know nothing of my
Nephew) had saved his Life, and he was sure would not hurt him;
and as for the Maid, he was sure, if she came to herself, she would be
very thankful for it, let us carry them where we would. The Surgeon
represented the Case so affectionately to me, that I yielded, and we
took them both on board with all their Goods, except eleven Hogs-
heads of Sugar, which could not be removed, or come at, and as tho
Youth had a Bill of Lading for them, I made his Commander sign a
Writing, obliging himself to go as soon as he came to Bristol, to one
Mr. Rogers a Merchant there, to whom the Youth said he was related,
and to deliver a Letter which I wrote to him, and all the Goods he
had belonging to the deceased Widow; which I suppose was not
done, for I could never learn that the Ship came to Bristol, but was,
as is most probable, lost at Sea, being in so disabled a Condition and
so far from any Land, that I am of Opinion, the first Storm she met
with afterwards, she might founder in the Sea, for she was leaky, and
had Damage in her Hold when we met with her.
I was now in the Latitude of 19 Deg. 32 Min. and had hitherto had
a tolerable Voyage as to Weather, though at first the Winds had
been contrary. I shall trouble nobody with the little Incidents of
Wind, Weather, Currents, 6-*c. on the rest of our Voyage; but short-
ening my Story for the sake of what is to follow, shall observe that I
came to my old Habitation, the Island, on the 10th of April 1695.
It was with no small Difficulty that I found the Place; for as I came
to it, and went from it before, on the South and East Side of the
Island, as coming from the Brasils, so now coming in between the
Main and the Island, and having no Chart for the Coast, nor any
Landmark, I did not know it when I saw it, or know whether I saw
it or no.
We beat about a great while, and went on Shore on several Islands
in the Mouth of the great River Oronooque, but none for my Purpose.
Qnly this I -learned by my Coasting the Shore, that I was under one
great Mistake before, viz. that the Continent which I thought I saw,
from the Island I lived in, was really no Continent, but a long Island,
or rather a Ridge of Islands, reaching from one to the other Side of
the extended Mouth of that great River, and that the Savages who
came to my Island, were not properly those which we call Caribbees,
but Islanders, and other Barbarians of the same Kind, who inhabited
something nearer to our Side than the rest
In short, I visited several of these Islands to no Purpose; some I
found were inhabited, and some were not On one of them I found
some Spaniards, and thought they had lived there, but speaking with
them, found they had a Sloop lay in a Creek hard by, and they came
thither to make Salt, and to catch some Pearl Mussels if they could,
but that they belong^ to the Isle de Trinidad, which lay farther North
in the Latitude of 10 and n Degrees.
But at last coasting from one Island to another, sometimes with the
Ship, sometimes with the French Man's Shallop, which we had found
a convenient Boat, and therefore kept her with their very good Will;
at length I came fair on the South Side of my Island, and I presently
knew the very Countenance of the Place; so I brought the Ship
safe to an Anchor, Broadside with the little Creek where was my
old Habitation.
As soon as I saw the Place, I called for Friday, and asked him if he
knew where he was? He looked about a little, and presently clapping
his Hands, cried; O yes, O there, Oyes, O there, pointing to our old
Habitation, and fell a dancing and capering like a mad Fellow, and
I had much ado to keep him from jumping into the Sea, to swim
ashore to the Place.
Well, Friday, says I, do you think we shall find anybody here or
no? And what do you think, shall we see your Father? The Fellow
stood mute as a Stock a good while, but when I named his Father,
the poor affectionate Creature looked dejected, and I could see the
Tears run down his Face very plentifully. What is the Matter,
Friday, says I? Are you troubled because you may see your Father?
No, no, says he, shaking his Head, no see him more, no ever more see
again; -why so, said I, Friday, how do you know that? O no, O no,
•ays Friday, he long ago die, long ago; he much old Man. Well,
well, says I, Friday, you don't know; but shall we see any one else
then? The Fellow, it seems, had better Eyes than I, and he points
just to the Hill above my old House; and though we lay half a
League off, he cries out, we see! we see! yes, we see much Men there,
and there, and there. T looked, but I could see nobody, no not with
a Perspective Glass, which was, I suppose, because I could not hit the
Place, for the Fellow was right, as I found upon Enquiry the next
Day, and there was five or six Men altogether, stood to look at the
Ship, not knowing what to think of us.
As soon as Friday had told me he saw People, I caused the English
Ancient to be spread, and fired three Guns, to give them Notice we
were Friends, and in about half a Quarter of an Hour after, we per-
ceiv'd a Smoke rise from the Side of the Creek, so I immediately
order'd a Boat out, taking Friday with me, and hanging out a white
Flag, or Flag of Truce, I went directly on Shore, taking with me
the young Friar I mention'd, to whom I had told the whole Story of
my living there, and the manner of it, and every Particular both of
3oa
ADVENTURES OF
myself, and those I left there; and who was on tiiat Account ex-
tremely desirous to go with me. We had besides about sixteen Men
very well armed, if we had found any new Guests there which we did
not know of; but we had no Need of Weapons.
As we went on Shore upon the Tide of Flood, near high Watei^
we rowed directly into the Creek, and the first Man I fixed my Eye
upon, was the Spaniard whose Life I had saved, and whom I knew
by his Face perfectly well; as to his Habit I shall describe it after-
wards. I order'd nobody to go on Shore at first but myself, but
there was no keeping Friday in the Boat; for the affectionate

—.^^t.
Creature had spied his Father at a Distance, a good Way off of the
Spaniards, where indeed I saw nothing of him; and if they had not
let him go on Shore, he would have jumped into the Sea. He was
no sooner on Shore, but he flew away to his Father like an Arrow
out of a Bow. It would have made any Man have shed Tears in
Spite of the firmest Resolution, to have seen the first Transports of
this poor Fellow's Joy when he came to his Father; how he embrac'd
him, kissed him, stroked his Face, took him up in his Arms, set him
down upon a Tree, and lay down by him, then stood and looked at
him, as any one would look at a strange Picture for a Quarter of an
30§
tloui together; then lie down on the Ground, and stroke his Legs,
and kiss them, and then get up again, and stare at him; one would
nave thought the Fellow bewitch'd: But it would have made a Dog
laugh to see how the next Day his Passion run out another Way: In
the Morning he walked along the Shore, to and again, with hi*
Father several Hours, always leading him by the Hand, as if he had
been a Lady; and every now and then he would come to fetch
something or other for him to the Boat, either a Lump of Sugar, or
a Dram, a Biscuit Cake, or something or other that was good. In
the Afternoon his Frolics run another Way; for then he would set
the old Man down upon O'.ie Ground, and dance about him, and

make a Thousand antic Postures and Gestures; and all the while he
did this, he would be talking to him, and telling him one Story or
another of his Travels, and of what had happen'd to him Abroad, to
divert him. In short, if the same filial Affection was to be found in
Christians to their Parents, in our Part of the World, one would be
tempted to say, there would hardly have been any Need of the fifth
Commandment.
But this is a Digression; I return to my Landing. It would be
endless to take Notice of all the Ceremonies and Civilities that the
Spaniards receiv'd me with. The first Spaniard whom, as I said. I
knew very well, was he whose Life I had saved; he came towards
the Boat, attended by one more, carrying a Flag of Truce also; and
he did not only not know me at first, but he had no Thoughts, no
Notion of its being me that was come, till I spoke to him: Seignor,
said I in Portuguese, Do you not know me? At which he spoke not
a Word; but giving his Musket to the Man that was with him, threw
his Arms abroad, and saying something in Spanish, that I did not
perfectly hear, comes forward, and embrac'd me, telling me he was
inexcusable, not to know that Face again, that he had once seen, as
of an Angel from Heaven sent to save his Life: He said Abundance
of very handsome Things, as a well-bred Spaniard always knows
how; and then beckoning to the Person that attended him, bade him
go and call out his Comrades. He then asked me, if I would walk
to my old Habitation, where he would give me Possession of my own
House again, and where I should see there had been but mean Im-
provements; so I walked along with him; but alas I could no
more find the Place again, than if I had never been there; for they
had planted so many Trees, and placed them in such a Posture, so
thick and close to one another; and in ten Years' Time they were
grown so big, that in short the Place was inaccessible, except by
such Windings and blind Ways, as they themselves only, who made
them, could find.
I asked them what put them upon all these Fortifications? He
told me, I would say there was Need enough of it, when they had
given me an Account how they had passed their Time since their
Arriving in the Island, especially after they had the Misfortune to
find that I was gone: He told me, he could not but have some
Satisfaction in my good Fortune, when he heard that I was gone
away in a good Ship, and to my Satisfaction; and that he had often
times a strong Persuasion, that one Time or other he should see me
again: But nothing that ever befel him in his Life, he said, was so
surprising and afflicting to him at first, as the Disappointment he
was under when he came back to the Island, and found I was not
there.
As to the three Barbarians (so he called them) that were left
behind, and of whom he said he had a long Story to tell me; the
Spaniards all thought themselves much better among the Savages,
only that their Number was so small. And, says he, had they been
strong enough, we had been all long ago in Purgatory; and with
that he crossed himself on the Breast: But Sir, says he, I hope yoi
will not be displeas'd, when I shall tell you how forced by Necessity
we were oblig'd, for our own Preservation to disarm them, and make
them our Subjects, who would not be content with being moderately
our Masters, but would be our Murderers. I answer'd, I was heartily
afraid of it when I left them there; and nothing troubled me at my
parting from the Island, but that they were not come back, that I
might have put them in Possession of everything first, and left the
other in a State of Subjection, as they deserv'd: But if they had
reduc'd them to it, I was very glad, and should be very far from
finding any Fault with it; for I knew they were a Parcel of refractory,
ungovern'd Villains, and were fit for any Manner of Mischief.
While I was saying this, came the Man whom he had sent back,
and with him eleven Men more: In the Dress they were in, it was
impossible to guess what Nation they were of: But he made all clear
both to them and to ma. First he turned to me, and pointing to them,
said, These, Sir, are some of the Gentlemen who owe their Lives to
you; and then turning to them, and pointing to me, he let them
know who I was; upon which they all came up one by one, not as if
they had been Sailors and ordinary Fellows, and I the like, but
really, as if they had been Ambassadors or Noblemen, and I a
Monarch or a great Conqueror; their Behaviour was to the last
Degree obliging and courteous, and yet mixed with a Manly, Majestic
Gravity, which veiy well became them; and in short, they had so
much more Manners than I, that I scarce knew how to receive their
Civilities, much less how to return them in Kind.
The History of their coming to, and Conduct in the Island, after
my going away, is so very remarkable, and has so many Incidents,
which the former Part of my Relation will help to understand, and
which will in most of the Particulars, refer to that Account I have
already given, that I cannot but commit them with great Delight to
the reading of those that come after me.
I shall no longer trouble the Story with a Relation in the first
Person, which will put me to the Expense of ten Thousand said fs,
and said he's, and he told trie's, and I told him's, and the like, but
I shall collect the Facts Historically, as near as I can gather them out
Of my Memory from what they related to me, and from what I met
with in my conversing with them and with the Place.
In order to do this succinctly, and as intelligibly as I can, I musl
go back to the Circumstance in which I left the Island, and in which
the Persons were of whom I am to speak. And first it is necessary
to repeat, that I had sent away Friday's Father and the Spaniard, the
two whose Lives I had rescued from the Savages; I say, I had sent
them away in a large Canoe to the Main, as I then thought it, to fetch
over the Spaniard's Companions who he had left behind him, in
order to save them from the like Calamity that he had been in, and
in order to succour them for the present, and that if possible, we
might together find some Way for our Deliverance afterward.
When I sent them away, I had no visible Appearance of, or the
least Room to hope for my own Deliverance any more than I had
twenty Years before, much less had I any Fore-knowledge of what,
afterwards happened, I mean of an English Ship coming on Shore
there to fetch me off: and it could but be a very great Surprise to
them when they came back, not only to find that I was gone, but to
find three Strangers left on the Spot, possess'd of all that I had left
behind me, which would otherwise have been their own.
The first Thing, however, which I inquir'd into, that I might begin
where I left off, was of their own Part; and I desir'd he would give
me a particular Account of his Voyage back to his Countrymen with
the Boat, when I sent him to fetch them over. He told me there
was little Variety in that Part, for nothing remarkable happen'd to
them on the Way, they having very calm Weather, and a smooth
Sea; for his Countrymen it could not be doubted, he said, but that they -
were overjoy'd to see him: (It seems he was the principal Man
among them, the Captain of the Vessel they had been shipwreck'd in,
having been dead some Time) they were, /u said, the more surprised
to see him, because they knew that he was fallen into the Hands of the
Savages, who, they were satisfy'd, would devour him as they did all
the rest of the Prisoners; that when he told them the Story of his
Deliverance, and in what Manner he was furnish'd for carrying them
away, it was like a Dream to them; and their Astonishment, they
said, was something like that of Joseph's Brethren, when he told them
who he was, and told them the Story of his Exaltation in Pharaoh's
Court: But when he showed them the Arms, the Powder, the Ball,
and the Provisions that he brought them for their Journey or Voyage,
they were restor'd to themselves, took a just Share of the Joy
of their Deliverance, and immediately prepar'd to come away with
him
307
Their first Business was to get Canoes; and in this they were
obliged not to stick so much upon the honest Part of it, but to
trespass upon their friendly Savages, and to borrow two large
Canoes, or Periaguas, on Pretence of going out a Fishing, or for
Pleasure.
In these they came away the next Morning; it seems they wanted
no Time to get themselves ready; for they had no Baggage, neither
Clothes or Provisions, or anything in the World, but what they had
on them, and a few Roots to eat, of which they used to make their
Bread.
They were in all three Weeks absent, and in that Time, unluckily
for them, I had the Occasion offend for my Escape, as I mention'd
in my other Part, and to get off from the Island, leaving three of the

.-.%?
most impudent, harden'd, ungovern'd, disagreeable Villains behind
me, that any Man could desire to meet with, to the poor Spaniard?
great Grief and Disappointment, you may be sure.
The only just Thing the Rogues did, was, That when the Spaniards
came on Shore, they gave my Letter to them, and gave them Provi-
sions and other Relief, as I had ordered them to do; also they gave
them the long Paper of Directions which I had left with them, con-
taining the particular Methods which I took for managing every Part
of my Life there, the Way how I baked my Bread, bred up tame
Goats, and planted my Corn, how I cured my Grapes, made my Pots,
and, in a Word, everything I did, all this being written down, they
gave to the Spaniards, two of whom understood English well enough;
nor did they refuse to accommodate the Spaniards with everything
else, for they agreed very well for some Time; they gave them an
equal Admission into the House, or Cave, and they began to live
very sociably, and the Head Spaniard, who had seen pretty much of
my Methods, and Friday's Father together, manag'd all their Affairs;
for, as for the Englishmen, they did nothing but ramble about the
Island, shoot Parrots, and catch Tortoises, and when they came
home at Night, the Spaniards provided their Suppers for them.
The Spaniards would have been satisfy'd with this, would the other
but have let them alone, which, however, they could not find in their
Hearts to do long; but like the Dog in the Manger, they would not
eat themselves, and would not let others eat neither: The Differ-
ences, nevertheless, were at first but trivial, and such as are not
worth relating; but at last it broke out into open War, and it begun
with all the Rudeness and Insolence that can be imagin'd, without
Reason, without Provocation, contrary to Nature, and indeed, to
common Sense; and though it is true the first Relation of it came from
the Spaniards themselves, whom I may call the Accusers, yet when I
came to examine the Fellows, they could not deny a Word of it
But before I come to the Particulars of this Part, I must supply a
Defect in my former Relation, and this was, that I forgot to set down
among the rest, that just as we were weighing the Anchor to set Sail,
there happen'd a little Quarrel on board our Ship, which I was afraid
once would have turned to a second Mutiny; nor was it appeas'd, till
the Captain rousing up his Courage, and taking us all to his Assis-
tance, parted them by Force, and making two of the most refractory
Fellows Prisoners, he laid them in Irons, and as they had been
active in the former Disorders, and let fall some ugly dangerous
Words the second Time, he threaten'd to carry them in Irons to
England, and have them hanged there for Mutiny, and running away
with the Ship.
This it seems, though the Captain did not intend to do it, frighted
some other Men in the Ship, and some of them had put it into the
Heads of the rest, that the Captain only gave them good Words for
the present, till they should come to some English Port, and that then
they should be all put into Jail, and tried for their Lives.
The Mate got Intelligence of this, and acquainted us with it; upon
which it was desir'd, that I, who still passed for a great Man among
them, should go down with the Mate, and satisfy the Men, and CjD
them, that they might be assur'd, if they Lchav'd well the rest of the
Voyage, all they had done for the Time past should be pardon'd. So I
went, and after passing my Honour's Word to them, they appear'd
easy; and the more so, when I caused the two Men, who were in
Irons, to be released and forgiven.
But this Mutiny had brought us to an Anchor for that Night, the
Wind also falling calm, next Morning we found, that our two
Men who had been laid in Irons, had stole each of them a Musket,
and some other Weapons, what Powder or Shot they had, we know
not; and had taken the Ship's Pinnace, which was not yet hauled
tip, and ran away with her to their Companions in Roguery on
Shore.
As soon as we found this, I order'd the Long-Boat on Shore, witi
twelve Men and the Mate, and away they went to seek the Rogues, but
they could neither find them, nor any of the rest; for they all fled into
the Woods when they saw the Boat coming on Shore. The Mate was
once resoVd, in Justice to their Roguery, to have destroy'd their
Plantations, burnt all their Household-Stuff and Furniture, and left
them to shift without it; but having no Order, he let it all alone, left
everything as they found it, and bringing the Pinnace away, came on
board without them.
These two Men made their Number five, but the other three Villains
were so much wickeder than these, that after they had been two or
three Days together, they turned their two New Comers out of Doors to
shift for themselves, and would have nothing to do with them, nor
could they for a good while be persuaded to give them any Food; as
for the Spaniards they were not yet come.
When the Spaniards came first on Shore, the Business began to go
forward; the Spaniards would have persuaded the three English
Brutes to have taken in their two Countrymen again, that, as they
said, they might be all one Family; but they would not hear of it:
So the two poor Fellows lived by themselves, and finding nothing
but Industry and Application would make them live comfortably,
they pitched their Tents on the North Shore of the Island, but a
little more on the West, to be out of the Danger of the Savages, who al-
ways landed on the East Parts of the Island.
Here they built them two Huts, one to lodge in, and the other to
lay up their Magazines and Stores in, and the Spaniards having given
them some Corn for Seed, and especially some of the Peas which I had
left tnem, they dug, and planted, and enclosed, after the Pattern 1
had set for them all, and began to live pretty well; their first Crop of
Cor n was on the Ground, and though it was but a little Bit of Land
which they had dug up at first, having had but a little Time, yet it
was enough to relieve them, and find them with Bread and othei
Eatables; and one of the Fellows being the Cook's Mate of the Ship,
was very ready at making Soup, Puddings, and other such Prepara-
tions, as the Rice, and the Milk, and such little Flesh as they got,
furnish'd him to do.
They were going on in this little thriving Posture, when the three
unnatural Rogues, their own Countrymen too, in mere Humour, and
to insult them, came and bully'd them, and told them, the Island was
theirs, that the Governor, meaning me, had given them Possession of
it, and nobody else had any Right to it, and damn them, they should
build no Houses upon their Ground, unless they would pay them Rent
for them.
The two Men thought they had jested at first, asked them to come
in and sit down, and see what fine Houses they were that they had
built, and tell them what Rent they demanded, and one of them
merrily told them, if they were Ground Landlords, he hoped, if they
built Tenements upon their Land, and made Improvements, they
would, according to the Custom of Landlords, grant them a long
Lease, and bid them go fetch a Scrivener to draw the Writings. One of
the three damning and raging, told them they should see they were not
in Jest, and going to a little Place at a Distance, where the honest Men
had made aFire to dress their Victuals, he takes a Firebrand, and claps
it to the Outside of their Hut, and very fairly set it on Fire, and it
would have been all burnt down in a few Minutes, if one of the two
had not run to the Fellow, thrust him away, and trod the Fire out
with his Feet, and that not without some Difficulty too.
The Fellow was in such a Rage at the honest Man's thrusting him
away, that he return'd upon him with a Pole he had in his Hand, and
had not the Man avoided the Blow very nimbly, and run into the
Hut, he had ended his Days at once; his Comrade seeing the
Danger they were both in, ran in after him, and immediately they came
both out with their Muskets, and the Man that was first struck at
with the Pole, knocked the Fellow down that begun the Quarrel,
with the Stock of his Musket, and that before the other two could
come to help him, and then seeing the rest come at them, they stood
together, and presenting the other Ends of their Pieces to tnem, bid
•Jiem stand off.
The other had Firearms with them too, but one of the two honest
Men, bolder than his Comrade, and made desperate by his Danger,
told them, if they offer'd to move Hand or Foot they were dead Men,
and boldly commanded them to lay down their Arms. They did not
indeed lay down their Arms, but seeing him so resolute, it brought
them to a Parley, and they consented to take their wounded Man
with them, and be gone; and indeed it seems the Fellow was wounded
sufficiently -with the Blow; however, they were much in the wrong,
since they had the Advantage, that they did not disarm them effec-
tually, as they might have done, and have gone immediately to the
Spaniards, and given them an Account how the Rogues had treated
them; for the three Villains studied nothing but Revenge, and every
Day gave them some Intimation that they did so.
But not to crowd this Part with an Account of the lesser Part of
their Rogueries, such as treading down their Corn, shooting three
young Kids, and a She-Goat, which the poor Men had got to breed
up tame for their Store; and, in a Word, plaguing them Night and
Day in this Manner, it forced the two Men to such a Desperation,
that they resolv'd to fight them all three the first Time they had a
fair Opportunity; in Order to this they resolv'd to go to the Castle, as
they called it, that was my old Dwelling, where the three Rogues
and the Spaniards all lived together/at that Time intending to have a
fair Battle, and the Spaniards should stand by to see fair Play; so they
got up in the Morning before Day, and came to the Place, and
jailed the Englishmen by their Names, telling a Spaniard, that
answer'd, that they wanted to speak with them.
It happen'd, that the Day before two of the Spaniards having been
in the Woods, had seen one of the two Englishmen, whom, for Dis-
tinction, I call ihelfonesl Men,andhe had made a sad Complaint to the
Spaniards of the barbarous Usage they had met with from their
three Countrymen, and how they had ruin'd their Plantation, and
destroy'd their Corn, that they had labour'd so hard to bring forward,
and killed the Milch-Goat and their three Kids, which was all they
had provided for their Sustenance, and that if he and his Friends,
meaning the Spaniards, did not assist them again, they should be
starved. When the Spaniards came home at Night, and they were all
at Supper, he took the Freedom to reprove the three Englishmen,
though in very gentle and mannerly Terms, and asked them, How
they could be so cruel, they being harmless inoffensive Fellows, and
that they were only putting themselves in a way to subsist by their
Labour, and that it had cost them a great deal of Pains to bring
things to such Perfection as they had?
One of the Englishmen return'd very briskly, what had they to do
there? That they came on Shore without Leave, and they should not
Plant or Build upon the Island, it was none of their Ground. Why, says
the Spaniard very calmly, Seignior Inglese, they must not starve. The
Englishman reply'd like a true rough-hewn Tarpaulin, they might
Starve and be Damned, they should not Plant nor Build. But what
must they do then, Seignior? said the Spaniard. Another of the
Brutes return'd, Do! D—n them, they should be Servants, and work
for them. But how can you expect that of them? says the Spaniard,
they are not bought with your Money; you have no Right to make
them Servants: The Englishman answer'd, the Island was theirs,
the Governor had given it to them, and no Man had anything to do
there but themselves; and with that swore by his Maker, that
they would go and burn all their new Huts, they should build none
upon their Land.
Why, Seignior, says the Spaniard, by the same Rule we must be
your Servants too. Ah, says the bold Dog, and so you shall too, be-
fore we have done with you, mixing two or three G—d Damme's in
the proper Intervals of his Speech; the Spaniard only smiled at
that, and made him no Answer: However, this little Discourse had
heated them, and starting up, one says to the other, I think it was
he they called Will Atkins, Come, Jack, let us go and have t'othei
Brush with them; we'll demolish their Castle, I'll warrant you, they
shall plant no Colony in our Dominions.
Upon this, they went all Trooping away, with every Man a Gun, a
Pistol, and a Sword, and mutter'd some insolent Things among them-
selves, of what they would do to the Spaniards too, when Opportunity
offer'd; but the Spaniards it seems did not so perfectly understand
them, as to know all the Particulars, only, that in general, they
threatened them hard for taking the two Englishmen's Part
Whether they went, or how they bestow'd their time that Evening,
the Spaniards said, they did not know; but it seems they wandered
about the Country, Part of the Night, and then lying down in the
Place which I used to call my Bower, they were weary, and overslept
313
themselves. The case was this, they had resolv'd to stay till Mid-
night, and so to take the two poor Men when they were asleep, and
as they acknowledg'd afterwards, intended to set Fire to their Huts
while they were in them, and either burn them in them, or murder
them as they came out, and as Malice seldom sleeps very sound, it
was very strange they should not have been kept waking.
However, as the two Men had also a Design upon them, as I have
said, though a much fairer one than that of Burning and Murdering,
it happen'd, and very luckily for them all, that they were up and
gone abroad, before the bloody-minded Rogues came to their Huts.
When they came there and found the Men gone, Atkins, who it
seems was the forwardest Man, called out to his Comrades, Yia.\/ack,
here's the Nest, but
^^.

D—n 'em the Birds
are flown; they
mused a while to
think what should
be the Occasion of
their being gone
abroad so soon, and
suggested presently,
that the Spaniards
had given them
Notice of it, and
with that they shook
Hands, and swore to
one another that they would be reveng'd of the Spaniards. As soon as
they had made this bloody Bargain they fell to work with the poor
Men's Habitation; they did not set Fire indeed to anything, but
they pulled down both their little Houses, and pulled them so Limb
from Limb, that they left not the least Stick standing, or scarce any
Sign on the Ground where they stood; they tore all their little col-
lected Household Stuff in Pieces, and threw everything about in such
a manner, that the poor Men afterwards found some of their Things
a Mile off of their Habitation.
When they had done this, they pulled up all the young Trees the
poor Men had planted, pulled up an Enclosure they had made to
secure their Cattle and their Corn; and in a word, sacked and plun-
der'd everything, as completely as a Horde of Tartars would have done,
The two Men were at this Juncture gone to find them out, and had
resolved to fight them wherever they had been, though they were but
two to three: So that had they met, there certainly would have been
Bloodshed among them, for they were all very stout resolute Fellows,
to give them their due.
But Providence took more Care to keep them asunder, than they
themselves could do to meet; for, as if they had dodged one another,
when the three were gone thither, the two were here; and afterwards
when the two went back to find them, the three were come to the old
Habitation again; we shall see their differing Conduct presently.
When the three came back like furious Creatures flushed with the
Rage which the Work they had been about had put them into, they
came up to the Spaniards, and told them what they had done, by way
of Scoff and Bravado; and one of them stepping up to one of the
Spaniards, as if they had been a Couple of Boys at Play, takes hold
of his Hat, as it was upon his Head, and giving it a Twirl about,
sneering in his Face, says he to him, And you, Seignior Jack Spaniard,
thall have the same Sauce, if you do not mend your Manners: The
Spaniard, who though a quiet civil Man, was as brave as a Man
could be desir'd to be, and withal a strong well-made Man, looked
steadily at him for a good while, and then having no Weapon in his
Hand, stepped gravely up to him, and with one Blow of his Fist
knocked him down, as an Ox is felled with a Pole-Axe; at which one
of the Rogues, insolent at the first, fired his Pistol at the Spaniard
immediately. He missed his Body indeed, for the Bullets went
through his Hair, but one of them touched the Tip of his Ear, and he
bled pretty much. The Blood made the Spaniard believe, he was
more hurt than he really was, and that put him into some Heat, for
before, he acted all in a perfect Calm; but now resolving to go
through with his Work, he stooped to take the Fellow's Musket whom
he had knocked down, and was just going to shoot the Man, and had
fired at him, when the rest of the Spaniards being in the Cave came
out, and calling to him not to shoot, they stepped in, secur'd the
other two, and took their Arms from them.
When they were thus disarm'd, and found they had made all the
Spaniards their Enemies, as well as their own Countrymen, they began
to cool, and giving the Spaniards better Words, would have had theii
Arms again; but the Spaniards considering the Feud that was between
them and the other two Englishmen, and that it would be the best
Method they could take to keep them from one another, told
them, they would do them no harm, and if they would live peaceably,
they would be very willing to assist and sociate with them, as they
did before; but that they could not think of giving them their Arms
again, while they appear'd so resolv'd to do Mischief with them to
their own Countrymen, and had even threatened them all, to make
them their Servants.
The Rogues were now no more capable to hear Reason, than to
act Reason, and being refus'd their Arms, they went raving away and
raging like Madmen, threatening what they would do, though they
had no Firearms. But the Spaniards, despising their Threatening,
told them they should take Care how they offer'd any Injury to their
Plantation or Cattle, for if they did, they would shoot them as they
would do ravenous Beasts, wherever they found them; and if they
fell into their Hands alive, they should certainly be hanged. How-
ever, this was far from cooling them, but away they went raging and
swearing like Furies of Hell. As soon as they were gone, came back
the two Men, in Passion and Rage enough also, though of another
Kind; for having been at their Plantation, and rinding it all demo-
lish'd and destroy'd, as above, it will easily be suppos'd they had
Provocation enough; they could scarce have Room to tell their Tale,
the Spaniards were so eager to tell them theirs; and it was strange
enough to find three Men thus bully nineteen, and receive no Punish-
ment at all.
The Spaniards indeed despised them, and especially having thus
disarm'd them, made light of all their Threatenings; but the two
Englishmen resolv'd to have their Remedy against them, what Pain
soever it cost to find them out
But the Spaniards interpos'd here too, and told them, that as they
had disarm'd them, they could not consent that they (the Two) should
pursue them with Firearms, and perhaps kill them; but, said the grave
Spaniard, who was their Governor, we will endeavour to make them
do you Justice if you will leave it to us, for as there is no doubt but
they will come to us again when their Passion is over, being not able
to subsist without our Assistance, we promise you to make no Peace
with them, without having a full Satisfaction for you; upon this Con-
dition we hope you will promise to use no Violence with them, other
than in your own Defence.
The two Englishmen yielded to this very awkwardly, and with sreai
Reluctance, but the Spaniards protested, they did it only to keep
them from Bloodshed, and to make all easy at last; for, said they,
we are not so many of us, here is Room enough for us all, and it is
great Pity we should not be all good Friends; at length they did
consent, and waited for the Issue of the Thing, living for some Days
with the Spaniards, for their own Habitation was destroyed.
In about five Days' Time the three Vagrants, tired with wandering
and almost starved with Hunger, having chiefly lived on Turtles' Eggs
all that while, came back to the Grove, and finding my Spaniard, who,
as I have said, was the Governor, and two more with him walking by
the Side of the Creek; they came up in a very submissive humble
Manner, and begged to be receiv'd again into the Family. The
Spaniards used them civilly, but told them, they had acted so unnatu-

rally by their Countrymen, and so very grossly by them (the Spaniards)
that they could not come to any Conclusion, without consulting the
two Englishmen and the rest; but however, they would go to them
and discourse about it, and they should know in half an Hour. It
may be guessed, that they were very hard put to it, for it seems, as
they were to wait this half Hour for an Answer, they begged they would
send them out some Bread in the meantime, which he did, and sent
them at the same Time a large Piece of Goat's Flesh, and a broiled
Parrot, which they eat very heartily, for they were hungry enough.
After half an Hour's Consultation they were called in, and a long
Debate had among them, their two Countrymen charging them with
the Ruin of all their Labour, and a Design to murder them; all which
they owned before, and therefore could not deny now; upon the
whole, the Spaniard acted the Moderator between them, and as they
had obliged the two Englishmen not to hurt the three while they were
flaked and unarmed, so they now obliged the three to go and build
their Fellows two Huts, one of the same, and the other cf larger
Dimensions, than they were before; to fence their Ground again,
where they had pulled up the Fences, plant Trees in the Room of
those pulled up, dig up the Land again for planting Corn, where they
had spoiled it: and in a Word, to restore everything in the same
State as they found it, as near as they could, for entirely it could not
be, the Season for the Corn, and the Growth of the Trees, and Hedges,
not being possible to be recovered.
Well, they submitted to all this, and as they had Plenty of Pro-
visions given them all the while, they grew very orderly, and the
whole Society began to live pleasantly and agreeably together, only
that these three Fellows could never be persuaded to work, I mean
for themselves, except now and then a little, just as they pleased;
however, the Spaniards told them plainly, that if they would but live
sociably and friendly together, and study in the whole the Good of
the Plantation, they would be content to work for them, and let them
walk about and be as idle as they pleased; and thus having lived
pretty well together for a Month or two, the Spaniards gave them
Arms again, and gave them Liberty to go abroad with them as
before.
It was not above a Week after they had these Arms, and went
abroad, but the ungrateful Creatures began to be as insolent and trouble-
some as before; but however, an Accident happening presently upon
this, which endanger'd the Safety of them all, they were oblig'd to
lay by all private Resentments, and look to the Preservation of their
Lives.
It happen'd one Night, that the Spaniard Governor, as I call him,
that is to say, the Spaniard, whose Life I had saved, who was now
the Captain, or Leader,, or Governor of the rest, found himself very
uneasy in the Night, and could by no Means get any Sleep; he was
perfectly well in Body, as he told me the Story, only found his
Thoughts tumultuous, his Mind run upon Men fighting and killing of
one another, but was broad awake, and could not by any Means get
any Sleep; in short, he lay a great while, but growing more and
more uneasy, he resolv'd to rise: As they lay, being so many of them,
upon Goat-skins, laid thick upon such Couches and Pads, as they
made for themselves, not in Hammocks and Ship Beds, as I did, who
was but one, so they had little to do, when they were willing to rise,
but to get up upon their Feet, and perhaps put on a Coat, such as it
was, and their Pumps, and they were ready for going any Way that
their Thoughts guided them.
Being thus gotten up, he looked out, but being dark, he could see
little or nothing, and besides, the Trees which I had planted, as in
my former Account is described, and which were now grown tall, in-
tercepted his Sight, so that he could only look up, and see that it was
a clear Starlight Night, and hearing no Noise, he return'd and laid
him down again; but it was all one, he could not sleep, nor could he
compose himself to anything like Rest, but his Thoughts were to the
last Degree uneasy, and yet he knew not for what
Having made some Noise with rising and walking about, going put
and coming in, another of them waked, and calling, asked, who it was
that was up? The Governor told him, how it had been with him.
Say you so, says the other Spaniard, such Things are not to be
slighted, I assure you; there is certainly some Mischief working, says
he, near us, and presently he asked him, where are the Englishmen t
They are all in their Huts, says he, safe enough. It seems, the
Spaniards had kept Possession of the main Apartment, and had made
a Place where the three Englishmen, since their last Mutiny always
quarter'd by themselves, and could not come at the rest Well, says
the Spaniard, there is something in it, I am persuaded from my own
Experience; I am satisfy'd our Spirits embodied have a Converse
with, and receive Intelligence from the Spirits unembodied and in-
habiting the invisible World, and this friendly Notice is given for our
Advantage, if we know how to make Use of it Come, says he, let
us go out and look abroad, and if we find nothing at all in it to justify
the Trouble, I'll tell you a Story to the Purpose, that shall convince
you of the Justice of my proposing it
In a Word, they went out to go to the Top of the Hill, where I
used to go, but they being strong and in good Company, not alone,
as I was, used none of my Cautions, to go up by the Ladder, and
then pulling it up after them, to go up a second Stage to the Top,
but were going round through the Grove unconcern'd and unwary,
when they were surpris'd with seeing a Light, as of Fire, a very little
Way off from them, and hearing the Voices of Men, not of one, or two,
but of a great Number.
In all the Discoveries 1 had made of the Savages landing on the
3«<3
Island, it was my constant Care to prevent them making the least
Discovery of there being any Inhabitant upon the Place; and when
by any Occasion they came to know it, they felt it so effectually, that
they that got away, were scarce able to give any Account of it, for we
disappear'd as soon as possible, nor did ever any that had seen me,
escape to tell any one else, except it were the three Savages in our
last Encounter, who jumped into the Boat, of whom I mention'd, that
I was afraid they should go Home and bring more Help.
Whether it was the Consequence of the Escape of those Men, that
so great a Number came now together, or whether they came igno-
rantly and by Accident on their usual bloody Errand, they could
not it seems understand; but whatever it was, it had been their Bust
ness, either to have conceal'd themselves, as not to have seen them
at all, much less to have let the Savages have seen that there were
any Inhabitants in the Place, or to have fallen upon them so effectu-
ally, as that not a Man of them should have escap'd, which could
only have been by getting in between them and their Boats; but
this Presence of Mind was wanting to them, which was the Ruin ol
their Tranquillity for a great while.
We need not doubt, but that the Governor and the Man with him,
surpris'd with this Sight ran back immediately, and raised then-
Fellows, giving them an Account of the imminent Danger they were
all in; and they again as readily took the Alarm, but it was impos-
sible to persuade them to stay close within where they were, but that
they must run all out to see how Things stood.
While it was dark indeed, they were well enough, and they had
Opportunity enough for some Hours to view them by the Light of
three Fires they had made at a Distance from one another; what they
were doing they knew not, and what to do themselves they knew not
For, first, the Enemy were too many; and secondly, they did not
keep together, but were divided into several Parties, and were on
Shore in several Places.
The Spaniards were in no small Consternation at this Sight, and
as they found that the Fellows ran straggling all over the Shore, they
made no Doubt, but first or last, some of them would chop in upon
their Habitation, or upon some other Place, where they would see the
Token of Inhabitants, and they were in great Perplexity also for fear
of their Flock of Goats, which would have been little less than starv-
ing them, if they should have been destroy'd; so the first Thing they
resolv'il upon, was to despatch three Men away before it was light, viz.
two Spaniards and one Englishman, to drive all the Goats away to
the great Valley where the Cave was, and if Need were, to drive
them into the very Cave itself.
Could they have seen the Savages altogether in one Body, and at
any Distance from their Canoes, they resolv'd, if they had been an
hundred of them, to have attack'd them; but that could not be ob
tain'd, for they were some of them two Miles off from the other, and,
as it appear'd afterwards, were of two different Nations.
After having mused a great while on the Course they should take,
and beaten their Brains in considering their present Circumstances,
they resolv'd at last, while it was dark, to send the old Savage, Fri-
day's Father, out as a Spy, to learn, if possible, something concerning
them, what they came for, and what they intended to do; the old
Man readily undertook it, and stripping himself quite naked, as most
of the Savages were, away he went: After he had been gone an Hour
or two, he brings Word, that he had been among them undiscover'd,
that he found they were two Parties, and of two several Nations who
had War with one another, and had had a great Battle in their own
Country, and that both Sides having had several Prisoners taken in
the Fight, they were by mere Chance landed all in the same Island,
for the devouring their Prisoners, and making merry; but their coming
so by Chance to the same Place had spoiled all their Mirth; that
they were in a great Rage at one another, and that they were so near,
that he believ'd they would fight again as soon as Daylight began to
appear; but he did not perceive that they had any Notion of any-
body's being on the Island but themselves. He had hardly made an
End of telling his Story, when they could perceive, by the un-
usual Noise they made, that the two little Annies were engag'd in a
bloody Fight
Friday's Father used all the Arguments he could to persuade our
people to lie close, and not be seen; he told them their Safety con-
sisted in it, and that they had nothing to do but lie still, and the
Savages would kill one another to their Hands, and then the rest
would go away; and it was so to a Tittle. But it was impossible V
prevail, especially upon the Englishmen, their Curiosity was so impor-
tunate upon their Prudentials, that they must run out and see the
Battle: However, they used some Caution too, (viz.) they did not go
openly, just by their own Dwelling, but went farther into the Woods,
3»«
and placed themselves to Advantage, where they might secirely see
them manage the Fight, and, as they thought, not to be seen by
them; but it seems the Savages did see them, as we shall find
hereafter.
The Battle was very fierce, and if I might believe the Englishmen,
one of them said, he could perceive, that some of them were Men of
great Bravery, of invincible Spirits, and of great Policy in guiding the
Fight The Battle, they said, held two Hours, before they could
guess which Party would be beaten; but then that Party which was
nearest our People's Habitation began to appear weakest, and after
some Time more, some of them began to fly; and this put our Men
again into a great Consternation, lest any of those that fled should
run into the Grove, before their Dwelling, for Shelter, and thereby
involuntarily discover the Place; and that by Consequence the Pur-
suers should do the like in Search for them. Upon this they resolv'd
that they would stand armed within the Wall, .and whoever came into
the Grove, they should sally out over the Wall and kill them ; so that,
if possible, not one should return to jr/ve an Account of it; they
order'd also, that it
should be done with
their Swords, or by
knocking them down
with the Stock of the
Musket, but not by
shooting them, for
fear of the Noise.
As they expected,
it fell out; three of
the routed Army fled
for Life, and, crossing
the Creek, ran directly
into the Place, not in
the least knowing whither they went, but running as into a thick Wood
for Shelter; the Scout they kept to look Abroad, gave Notice of this
within, with this Addition, to our Men's great Satisfaction (viz.) That
the Conquerors had not pursued them, or seen which Way they were
gone; upon this, the Spaniard Governor, a Man of Humanity,
would not suffer them to kill the three Fugitives, but sending three
Men out by the Top of the Hill, order'd them to go round and coma

in behind them, surprise and take them Prisoners, which was done;
the Residue of the conquer'd People fled to their Canoes and got
off to Sea; the Victors retir'd, and made no Pursuit or very little,
but drawing themselves into a Body together, gave two great scream-
ing Shouts, which they suppos'd was by way of Triumph, and so the
Fight ended: And the same Day, about three o'clock in the After-
noon, they also marched to their Canoes. And thus the Spaniards
had their Island again free to themselves, their Fright was over, and
they saw no Savages in several Years after.
After they were all gone, the Spaniards came out of their Den, and
viewing the Field of Battle, they found about two-and-thirty dead
Men upon the Spot; some were killed with great long Arrows, some
of which were found sticking in their Bodies; but most of them were
killed with their great wooden Swords, sixteen or seventeen of which
they found in the Field of Battle, and as many Bows, with a great
many Arrows: These Swords were strange great unwieldy Things,
and they must be very strong Men that used them: Most of those
Men that were killed with them, had their Heads mashed to pieces,
as we may say, or as we call it in English, their Brains knocked out,
and several their Arms and Legs broken; so that it is evident they
fight with inexpressible Rage and Fury. We found not one wounded
Man that was not stone dead; for either they stay by their Enemy
till they have quite killed him, or they carry all the wounded Men,
that are not quite dead, away with them.
This Deliverance tamed our Englishmen for a great while; the
Sight had filled them with Horror, and the Consequences appear'd
terrible to the last Degree, even to them, if ever they should fall into
the Hands of those Creatures, who would not only kill them as Ene-
mies, but kill them for Food, as we kill our Cattle. And they pro-
fess'd to me, that the Thoughts of being eaten up like Beef or Mut-
ton, though it was suppos'd it was not to be till they were dead, had
something in it so horrible, that it nauseated their very Stomachs,
made them sick when they thought of it, and filled their Minds with
such unusual Terror, that they were not themselves for some Weeks
after.
This, as I said, tamed even the three English Brutes I have been
speaking of; and for a great while after they were very tractable, and
went about the common Business of their whole Society well enough;
planted, sowed, reaped, and began to be all naturaliz'd to the Coun-
try. But sometime after this, they fell all into such Measures which
brought them into a great deal of Trouble.
They had taken three Prisoners, as I had observ'd, and these
three being lusty stout young Fellows, they made them Servants, and
taught them to work for them; and, as Slaves, they did well enough;
but they did not take their Measures with them as I did by my Man
Friday, viz. to begin with them upon the Principle of having saved
their Lives, and then instruct them in the rational Principles of Life,
much less of Religion, civilizing and reducing them by kind Usage and
affectionate Arguings; but as they gave them their Food every Day,
so they gave them their Work too, and kept them fully employ'd in
Drudgery enough; but they failed in this, by it, that they never had
them to assist them and fight for them, as I had my Man Friday, who
was as true to me as the very Flesh upon my Bones.
But to come to the Family Part, being all now good Friends; for
common Danger, as I said above, had effectually reconcil'd them,
they began to consider their general Circumstances; and the first
Thing that came under their Consideration was, Whether, seeing the
Savages particularly haunted that Side of the Island, and that there
were more remote and retir'd Parts of it equally adapted to their
Way of Living, and manifestly to their Advantage, they should not
rather remove their Habitation, and plant in some more proper Place
for their Safety, and especially for the Security of their Cattle and
Corn?
Upon this, after long Debate, it was concluded, That they would
not remove their Habitation; because, that sometime or other they
thought they might hear from their Governor again, meaning r^e; and
if I should send any one to seek them, I should be sure to direct them
to that Side, where, if they should find the Place demolish'd, they
would conclude the Savages had killed us all, and we were gone and
so our Sapply would go too.
But as to their Corn and Cattle, they agreed to remove them into
the Valley where my Cave was, where the Land was as proper foi
both, and where indeed there was Land enough: However, upon
second Thought, they alter'd one Part of that Resolution too, and
resolv'd only to remove Part of their Cattle thither, and plant Part of
their Corn there; and so if one Part was destroy'd the other might
be saved: And one Part of Prudence they used, which it was very
well they did, viz. That they never trusted those three Savages, which
they had Prisoners, with knowing anything of the Plantation they had
made in that Valley, or of any Cattle they had there; much less of
the Cave there, which they kept, in Case of Necessity, as a safe
Retreat, and whither they carry'd also the two Barrels of Powder,
which I had sent them at my coming away.
But however they resolv'd not to change their Habitation, yet
they agreed, that as I had carefully cover'd it first with a Wall or
Fortification, and then with a Grove of Trees; so, seeing their Safety
consisted entirely in their being conceal'd, of which they were now
fully convinc'd; they set to Work to cover and conceal the Place yet
more effectually than before: To this Purpose, as I had planted
Trees, (or rather thrust in Stakes, which in Time all grew up to be
Trees) for some good Distance before the Entrance into my Apart-
ment, they went on in the same Manner, and filled up the rest of
that whole Space of Ground, from the Trees I had set, quite down to
the Side of the Creek, where, as I said, I landed my Floats, and even
into the very Ooze where the Tide flowed, not so much as leaving any
Place to land, or any Sign that there had been any Landing there-
about: These Stakes also, being of a Wood very forward to grow, as
I have noted formerly, they took Care to have generally very much
larger and taller than those which I had planted; and as they grew
apace, so they planted them so very thick and close together, that
when they had been three or four Years grown, there was no piercing
with the Eye any considerable Way into the Plantation. And as for
that Part which I had planted, the Trees were grown as thick as a
Man's Thigh; and among them they placed so many other short
ones, and so thick, that, in a Word, it stood like a Pallisado, a
quarter of a Mile thick, and it was next to impossible to penetrate it,
but with a little Army to cut it all down; for a little Dog could
hardly get between the Trees, they stood so close.
But this was not all; for they did the same by all the Ground to the
right Hand, and to the Left, and round even to the Top of the Hill;
leaving no Way, not so much as for themselves to come out, but by
the Ladder placed up to the Side of the Hill, and then lifted up, and
placed again from the first Stage up to the Top; which Ladder,
when it was taken down, nothing but what had Wings or Witchcraft
to assist it, could come at them.
This was excellently well contriv'd : Nor was it less than what they
afterwards found Occasion for; which served to convince me, that aa
human Prudence has the Authority of Providence to justify it, so it
has, doubtless, the Direction of Providence to set it to Work; and
would we listen carefully to the Voice of it, I am fully persuaded we
might prevent many of the Disasters which our Lives are now, by our
Negligence, subjected to. But this by the Way.
I return to the Story. They lived two Years after this in perfect
Retirement, and had no more Visits from the Savages: They had,
indeed, an Alarm given them one Morning, which put them into a
great Consternation; for some of the Spaniards being out early one
Morning on the West Side, or rather the End of the Island, which, by
the Way, was that End where I never went, for fear of being discover'd,
they were surpris'd with seeing above twenty Canoes of Indians, just
coming on Shore.
They made the best of their Way Home, in Hurry enough; ana,
giving the Alarm to their Comrades, they kept close all that Day and
the next, going out only at Night, to make Observation: But they
had the good Luck to be mistaken; for, wherever the Savages went,
they did not land at that Time on the Island, but pursued som<; other
Design.
And now they had another Broil with the three Englishmen; one
of which, a most turbulent Fellow, being in a Rage at one of the three
Slaves, which I mention'd they had taken, because the Fellow
had not done something right which he bid him do, and seemed a
little intractable in his showing him, drew a Hatchet out of a Frog
Belt in which he wore it by his Side, and fell upon the poor Savage,
not to correct him, but to kill him. One of the Spaniards, who was
by, seeing him give the Fellow a barbarous Cut with the Hatchet,
which he aimed at his Head, but struck into his Shoulder, so that he
thought he had cut the poor Creature's Arm off, ran to him, and en-
treating him not to murder the poor Man, clapt in between him and
the Savage, to prevent the Mischief.
The Fellow being enrag'd the more at this, struck at the Spaniard
with his Hatchet, and swore he would serve him as he intended to
serve the Savage; which the Spaniard perceiving, avoided the Blow;
and with a Shovel which he had in his Hand, (for they were all
working in the Field about their Corn-Land) knocked the Brute
down: Another of the Englishmen running at the same Time to help
his Comrade, knocked the Spaniard down; and then two Spaniards
more came in to help their Man, and a third Englishman fell in upon
I! B
them. They had none of them any Firearms, or any other Weapons
but Hatchets and other Tools, except this third Englishman; he had
one of my old rusty Cutlasses, with which he made at the two last
Spaniards, and wounded them both. This Fray set the whole
Family in an Uproar, and more Help coming in, they took the three
Englishmen Prisoners. The next Question was, What should be
done with them, they had been so often mutinous, and were so
furious, so desperate, and so idle withal, that they knew not what
Course to take with them; for they were mischievous to the highest
Degree, and valued not what Hurt they did to any man; so that, in
short, it was not safe to live with them.
The Spaniard, who was Governor, told them in so many Words,
That if they had been of his own Country, he would have hanged
them; for all Laws and all Governors were to preserve Society; and
those who were dangerous to the Society, ought to be expell'd out of
it; but as they were Englishmen, and that it was to the generous
kindness of an Englishman that they all owed their Preservation and
Deliverance, he would use them with all possible Lenity, and would
leave them to the Judgment of the other two Englishmen, who were
their Countrymen.
One of the two honest Englishmen stood up, and said, they desir'd it
might not be left to them; for, says he, I am sure we ought to sentence
them to the Gallows; and with that gives an Account how Will. Atkins,
one of the three, had proposed to have all the five Englishmen join
together, and muriier all the Spaniards when they were in their Sleep.
When the Spanish Governor heard this, he calls to William Atkins,
How, Seignior Atkins, says he, would you murder us all? What have
you to say to that? That harden'd Villain was so far from denying it,
that he said it was true, and G—d d—m him they would do it
still before they had done with them. Well, but Seignior Atkins,
says the Spaniard, What have we done to you, that you would kill us?
And what would you get by killing us? And what must we do to pre-
vent your killing us? Must we kill you, or you will kill us? Why will
you put us to the Necessity of this, Seignior Atkins ? says the Spaniard
very calmly and smiling.
Seignior Atkins was in such a Rage at the Spaniard's making a Jest
of it, that had he not been held by three Men, and withal had no
Weapons with him, it was thought he would have attempted to have
killed the Spaniard in the Middle of all the Company.
This hairbrain'd Carnage oblig'd them to consider seriously what was
to be done. The two Englishmen and the Spaniard who saved the
poor Savage, was of the Opinion, they should hang one of the three
for an Example to the rest, and that, particularly, it should be he that
had twice attempted to commit Murder with his Hatchet: and indeed
there was some Reason to believe he had done it, for the poor Savage
was in such a miserable Condition with the Wound he had receiv'd,
that it was thought he could not live.
But the Governor Spaniard still said No, it was an Englishman
that had saved all their Lives, and he would never consent to put an
Englishman to Death, though he had murder'd half of them, nay,
he said, if he had been killed himself by an Englishman, and had
Time left to speak, it should be, that they should pardon him.
This was so positively insisted on by the Governor Spaniard, that
there was no gainsaying it; and as merciful Councils are most apt to
prevail where they are so earnestly pressed, so they all came into it;
but then it was to be consider'd, what should be done to keep them
from doing the Mischief they design'd; for all agreed, Governor and
all, that Means were to be used for preserving the Society from Dan-
ger; after a long Debate it was agreed, First, That they should be
disarm'd, and not permitted to have either Gun, or Powder, or Shot,
or Sword, or any Weapon, and should be turned out of the Society,
and left to live where they would, and how they would, by themselves;
but that none of the rest, either Spaniards or English, should con-
verse with them, speak with them, or have anything to do with them;
that they should be forbid to come within a certain Distance of the
Place where the rest dwelt; and that if they offer'd to commit any
Disorder, so as to spoil, burn, kill, or destroy any of the Corn, Plant-
ings, Buildings, Fences, or Cattle belonging to the Society, they
should die without Mercy, and they would shoot them wherever they
could find them.
The Governor, a Man of Great Humanity, musing upon the Sen-
tence, consider'd a little upon it, and turning to the two honest
Englishmen, said, Hold, you must reflect, that it will be long e'er
they can raise Corn and Cattle of their own, and they must not starve:
We must therefore allow them Provisions, so he caused to be added,
That they should have a Proportion of Corn given them to last
them eight Months, and for Seed to sow, by which Time they might
be suppos'd to raise some of their own; that they should have six
Milch-Goats, four He-Goats, and six Kids given them, as well for
present Subsistence, as for a Store; and that they should have Tools
given them for their Work in the Fields; such as, six Hatchets, an
Axe, a Saw, and the like: But they should have none of these Tools,
or Provisions, unless they would swear solemnly, that they would not
hurt or injure any of the Spaniards with them, or of their Fellow
Englishmen.
Thus they dismiss'd them the Society, and turned them out to
shift for themselves. They went away sullen and refractory, as
neither contented to go away, or to stay; but, as there was no Remedy,
they went, pretending to go and choose a Place where they would
settle themselves to plant and live by themselves, and some Provi-
sions were given them, but no Weapons.
About four or five Days after, they came again for Victuals, and
gave the Governor an Account where they had pitched their Tents,
and marked themselves out a Habitation and Plantation; and it was
a very convenient Place indeed, on the remotest Part of the Island,
N.E., much about the Place where I landed in my first Voyage, when
I was driven out to Sea, the Lord knows whither, in my Attempt to
surround the Island.
Here they built themselves two handsome Huts and contriv'd
them, in a Manner, like my first Habitation, being close under the
Side of a Hill, having some Trees growing already on three Sides of it,
so that by planting others it would be very easily cover'd from the
Sight, unless narrowly searched for; they desir^ some dried Goat-
skins for Beds and Covering, which were given them; and upon
giving their Words, that they would not disturb the rest, or injure any
of their Plantations, they gave them Hatchets, and what other Tools
they could spare; some Peas, Barley and Rice, for sowing, and, in a
Word, anything they wanted, but Arms and Ammunition.
They lived in this separate Condition about six Months, and had
gotten in their first Harvest, though the Quantity was but small, the
Parcel of Land they had planted being but little; for indeed, having
all their Plantation to form, they had a great deal of Work upon their
Hands; and when they came to make Boards, and Pots, and such
Things, they were quite out of their Element, and could make
nothing of it; and when the rainy Season came on, for want of a Cavt
in the Earth, they could not keep their Grain dry, and it was in grea4.
Danger of spoiling: And this humbled them much - so they came
and begged the Spaniards to help them, which they very readily did,
and in four Days worked a great Hole in the Side of the Hill for them,
big enough to secure their Corn, and other Things from the Rain;
but it was but a poor Place, at best, compar'd to mine; and especially
as mine was then, for the Spaniards had greatly enlarge it, and made
several new Apartments in it
About three Quarters of a Year after this Separation, a new Frolic
took these Rogues, which, together with the former Villainy they had
committed, brought Mischief enough upon them, and had very near
been the Ruin of the whole Colony: The three new Sociates began,
it seems, to be weary of the laborious Life they led, and that without
Hope of bettering their Circumstances ; and a Whim took them, that
they would make a Voyage to the Continent from whence the Savages
came, and would try if they could not seize upon some Prisoners
among the Natives there, and bring them Home, so to make them do
the laborious Part of their Work for them.
The Project was not so preposterous, if they had gone no farther; but
they did nothing, and propos'd nothing, but had either Mischief in
the Design, or Mischief in the Event: And if I may give my Opinion,
they seemed to be under a Blast from Heaven; for if we will not
allow a visible Curse to pursue visible Crimes, how shall we reconcile
the Events of Things with the Divine Justice? It was certainly an
apparent Vengeance on their Crime of Mutiny and Piracy, that
brought them to the State they were in; and as they showed not the
least Remorse for the Crime, but added new Villanies to it, such as,
particularly, the Piece of monstrous Cruelty of wounding a poor Slave,
because he did not, or perhaps could not, understand to do what he
was directed; and to wound him in such a Manner, as, no Question,
made him a Cripple all his Life; and in a Place where no Surgeon or
Medicine could be had for his Cure; and what was still worse, the
murderous Intent, or, to do Justice to the Crime, the intentional
Murder, for such to be sure it was, as was afterwards the formed
Design they all laid, to murder the Spaniards in cold Blood, and in
their Sleep.
But I leave observing, and return to the Story: The three Fel-
lows came down to the Spaniards one Morning, and in very humble
Terms desir'd to be admitted to Speak with them: The Spaniards
very readily heard what they had to say, which was this, That they were
tired of living in the Manner they did; that they were not handy

ADVENTURES OF
enough to make the Necessaries they wanted; and that having no
Help, they found they should be starved: But if the Spaniards would
give them Leave to take one of the Canoes which they came over
in, and give them Arms and Ammunition, proportion'd for their De
fence, they would go over to the Main, and seek their Fortune, anc
so deliver them from the Trouble of supplying them with any other Pro-
visions.
The Spaniards were glad enough to be rid of them, but yet very
honestly represented to them the certain Destruction they were run-
ning into; told them they had suffer'd such Hardships upon that
very Spot, that they could, without any Spirit of Prophesy, tell them
that they would be starved, or be murder'd, and bade them consider
of it
The Men reply'd audaciously, they should be starved if they stayed
here, for they could not work, and would not work; and they could
but be starved Abroad, and if they were murder'd, there was an End
of them, they had no Wives or Children to cry after them; and in
short, insisted importunately upon their Demand, declaring that they
would go, whether they would give them any Arms or no.
The Spaniards
told them, with great
Kindness, that if
they were resolv'd
to go, they should
not go like naked
Men, and be in no
Condition to defend
themselves; and that
though they could
ill spare their Fire-
arms, having not
enough for them-
selves, yet they
would let them have
two Muskets, a Pistol, and a Cutlass, and each Man a Hatchet, which
they thought was sufficient for them.
In a Word, they accepted the Offer, and having baked them Bread
enough to serve them a Month, and given them as much Goats-Flesh
as they could eat while it was sweet, and a great Basket full of dried

Grapes, a Pot full of fresh Water, and a young Kid alive to kill, they
boldly set out in a Canoe for a Voyage over the Sea, where it was
at least 40 Miles broad.
The Boat was indeed a large one, and would have very well carry'd
fifteen or twenty Men; and, therefore, was rather too big lor them to
manage: But as they had a fair Breeze, and the Flood-Tide with
them, they did well enough: They had made a Mast of a long Pole,
and a Sail of four large Goat-Skins dried, which they had sewed or
laced together; and away they went merrily enough; the Spaniards
called after them, Bon Veyajo; and no Man ever thought of seeing
them any more.
The Spaniards would often say to one another, and to the two
honest Englishmen who remain'd behind, how quietly and comfortably
they lived now those three turbulent Fellows were gone; as for their
ever coming again, that was the remotest Thing from their Thoughts
that could be imagin'd; when behold, after two-and-twenty Days'
Absence, one of the Englishmen being abroad upon his Planting-
Work, sees three strange Men coming towards him at a Distance,
with Guns upon their Shoulders.
Away runs the Englishman, as if he was bewitch'd, comes frighted
and amaz'd to the Governor Spaniard, and tells him they were all un-
done, for there were Strangers landed upon the Island, he could not
tell who: The Spaniard, pausing awhile, says to him, How do you
mean, you cannot tell who? They are the Savages to be sure. No,
no, says the Englishman, they are Men in Clothes with Arms: Nay,
then, says the Spaniard, Why are you concern'd? If they are not
Savages they must be Friends, for there is no Christian Nation upon
Earth but will not do us Good rather than Harm.
While they were debating thus, comes the three Englishmen, and
standing without the Wood, which was new planted, hallow'd to them;
they presently knew their Voices, and so all the Wonder of that kind
ceased. But now the Admiration was turned upon another Question,
(viz.) what could be the Matter, and what made them come back
again?
It was not long before they brought the Men in, and inquiring
where they had been, and what they had been doing, they gave them
a full Account of their Voyage in a few Words, (viz.) That they
reached the Land in two Days, or something less, but finding the
People alarm'd at their coming, and preparing with Bows and Arrows
to fight them, they durst not go on Shore, but sailed on to the
Northward six or seven Hours, till they came to a gTeat Opening, by
which they perceiv'd that the Land they saw from our Island was not
the Main, but an Island; that entering that Opening of the Sea,
they saw another Island on the Right-Hand North, and several more
West; and being resolv'd to land somewhere, they put over to one of
the Islands which lay West, and went boldly on Shore; that they
found the People very courteous and friendly to them, and that they
gave them several Roots and some dried Fish, and appear'd very
sociable; and the Women, as well as the Men, were very forward to
supply them with anything they could get for them to eat, and brought
it to them a great Way upon their Heads.
They continu'd here four Days, and inquir'd as well as they could
of them by Signs, what Nations were this Way and that Way; and
were told of several fierce and terrible People that lived almost every
Way, who, as they made signs to them, used to eat Men. But as for
themselves, they said, that they never eat Men or Women, except only
such as they took in the Wars, and then they owned that they made
a great Feast, and eat their Prisoners.
The Englishmen inquir'd when they had a Feast of that Kind,
and they told them about two Moons ago, pointing to the Moon, and
then to two Fingers; and that their great King had two hundred
Prisoners now, which he had taken in his War; and they were feed-
ing them to make them fat for the next Feast The Englishmen
seemed mighty desirous to see those Prisoners, but the other mis-
taking them, thought they were desirous to have some of them to
carry away for their own eating. So they beckon'd to them, pointing
to the setting of the Sun, and then to the rising, which was to signify,
that the next Morning at Sunrising they would bring some for them;
and accordingly the next Morning they brought down five Women
and eleven Men, and gave them to the Englishmen, to carry with
them on their Voyage, just as we would bring so many Cows and
Oxen down to a Seaport Town, to victual a Ship.
As brutish and barbarous as these Fellows were at Home, their
Stomachs turned at this Sight, and they did not know what to do;
to refuse the Prisoners, would have been the highest Affront to the
Savage Gentry that offer'd them; and what to do with them they
knew not; however, upon some Debates, they resolv'd to accept of
them, and in Return they gave the Savage? that brought them one
of their Hatchets, an old Key, a Knife, and six or seven of their
Bullets, which, though they did not understand, they seemed extremely
pleased with: And then tying the poor Creatures' Hands behind
them, they (the People) dragged the poor Prisoners into the Boat
for our Men.
The Englishmen were oblig'd to come away as soon as they had
them, or else they that gave them this noble Present would certainly
have expected that they should have gone to work with them, have
killed two or three of them the next Morning, and perhaps have in-
vited the Donors to Dinner.
But having taken their Leave with all the Respects and Thanks
that could well pass between People, where on either Side they un-
derstood not one Word they could say, they put off with their Boat,
and came back towards the first Island, where, when they arriv'd,
they set eight of their Prisoners at Liberty, there being too many of
them for their Occasion.
In their Voyage, they endeavour'd to have some Communication
with their Prisoners, but it was impossible to make them understand
anything; nothing they could say to them, or give them, or do for
them, but was looked upon as going about to murder them. They
first of all unbound them, but the poor Creatures screamed at that,
especially the Women, as if they had just felt the Knife at their
Throats; for they immediately concluded they were unbound on
purpose to be killed.
If they gave them anything to eat, it was the same Thing; then
they concluded it was for fear they should sink in Flesh, and so not
be fat enough to kill. If they looked at one of them more particularly,
the Party presently concluded, it was to see whether he or she was
fattest and fittest to kill. Nay, after they had brought them quite
over, and began to use them kindly, and treat them well, still they
expected every Day to make a Dinner or a Supper for their new
Masters.
When the three Wanderers had given this unaccountable History
or Journal of their Voyage, the Spaniard asked them, Where their new
Family was? and being told that they had brought them on Shore,
and put them into one of their Huts, and were come up to beg some
Victuals for them; they (the Spaniards) and the other two Englishmen,
that is to say, the whole Colony, resolv'd to go all down to the Place
and see them, and did so, and Friday's Father with them.
ADVENTURES OF
When they came into the Hut, there they sat all bound; for when
they had brought them on Shore, they bound their Hands that they
might not take the Boat and make their Escape. There, I say, they
sat, all of them stark naked. First, There were three Men, lusty
comely Fellows, well shaped, straight and fair Limbs, about thirty to
thirty-five Years of Age; and five Women, whereof two might be from
thirty to forty, two more not above four or five-and-twenty, and the
fifth, a tall comely Maiden about sixteen or seventeen: The Women
were well favour'd agreeable Persons both in Shape and Features,
only tawny, and two of them, had they been perfect White, would
have passed for very handsome Women even in London itself, having
pleasant agreeable Countenances and of a very modest Behaviour,
especially when they came afterwards to be clothed, and dressed, as
they called it, though the Dress was very indifferent it must be con-
fess'd; of which hereafter.
The Sight, you may be sure, was something uncouth to our Spaniards,
who were (to give them a just Character) Men of the best Behaviour,
of the most calm, sedate Tempers, and perfect Good humour that
ever I met with, and in particular, of the most Modesty, as will pre-
sently appear: I say, the Sight was very uncouth, to see two naked
Men and five naked Women, all together bound, and in the most
miserable Circumstances that Human Nature could be suppos'd to be,
(viz.) to be expecting every Moment to be dragged out, and have
their Brains knocked out, and then to be eaten up like a Calf that is
killed for a Dainty.
The first Thing they did, was to cause the old Indian, Friday's
Father, to go in and see first if he knew any of them, and then if he
understood any of their Speech: As soon as the old Man came in,
he looked seriously at them, but knew none of them; neither could
any of them understand a Word he said, or a Sign he could make,
except one of the Women.
However, this was enough to answer the End, which was to satisfy
them, that the Men into whose Hands they were fallen, were Christians;
that they abhorr'd eating of Men or Women, and that they might be
sure they would not be killed: As soon as they were assur'd of this,
they discover'd such a Joy, and by such awkward, and several Ways,
as is hard to describe; for it seems they were of several Nations.
The Woman, who was their Interpreter, was bid in the next Place
to ask them, if they were willing to be Servants, and to work tor the
Men who had brought them away, to save their Lives; at which they
all fell a Dancing; and presently one fell to taking up this, and
another that, anything that lay next, to carry on their Shoulders,
to intimate that they were willing to work.
The Governor, who found, that the having Women among them
would presently be attended with some Inconvenience, and might
occasion some Strife, and perhaps Blood; asked the three Men, what
they intended to do with these Women, and how they intended to
use them; whether as Servants, or as Women? One of the Englishmen
answer'd very boldly and readily, That they would use them as both.
To which the Governor said, I am not going to restrain you from it,
you are your own Masters as to that: But this I think is but just, for
avoiding Disorders and Quarrels among you; and I desire it of you,
for that Reason only, viz. That you will all engage, that if any of you
take any of these Women, as a Woman or Wife, that he shall take
but one; and that having taken one, none else should touch her; for
though we cannot marry any of you, yet it is but reasonable, that while
you stay here, the Woman any of you takes, should be maintain'd by
the Man that takes her, and should be his Wife; I mean, says he,
while he continues here, and that none else shall have anything to do
with her: All this appear'd so just, that every one agreed to it with-
out any Difficulty.
Then the Englishmen asked the Spaniards, if they design'd to take
any of them? But every one of them answer'd, NO: Some of them
said, they had Wives in Spain, and the others did not like Women
that were not Christians; and all together declar'd, that they would
not touch one of them; which was an Instance of such Virtue, as I
have not met with in all my Travels. On the other Hand, to be short,
the five Englishmen took them every one a Wife, that is to say, a
temporary Wife; and so they set up a new Form of Living; for the
Span 'ards and Friday's Father lived in my old Habitation, which they
had enlarg'd exceedingly within. The three Servants which were
taken in the late Battle of the Savages, lived with them; and these
carry" d on the main Part of the Colony, supplying all the rest with
Food, and assisting them in anything as they could, or as they found
Necessity requir'd.
But the Wonder of this Story was, how five such refractory ill-
match'd Fellows should agree about these Women, and that two of
tnem should not pitch upon the same Woman, especially seeing two
or thi^e of them were, without Comparison, more agreeable than the
other: But they took a good Way enough to prevent quarrelling
imong themselves; for they set the five Women by themselves in one
nf their Huts, and they went all into the other Hut, and drew Lots
among them, who should choose first
He that drew to choose first, went away by himself to the Hut
where the poor naked Creatures were, and fetched out her he chose;
and it was worth observing, that he that chose first took her that was
reckon'd the homeliest, and the oldest of the five, which made Mirth
enough among the rest; and even the Spaniards laughed at it: But
the Fellow consider'd better than any of them, that it was Application
and Business that they were to expect Assistance in, as much as any-
thing else; and she proved the best Wife of all the Parcel.
When the poor Women saw themselves set in a Row thus, and
fetched out one by one, the Terrors of their Condition return'd upon
them again, and they firmly believ'd that they were now agoing to be
devour'd; accordingly, when the English Sailor came in and fetched
out one of them, the rest set up a most lamentable Cry, and hung
about her, and took their Leave of her with such Agonies and such
Affection, as would have grieved the hardest Heart in the World; nor
was it possible for the Englishmen to satisfy them, that they were not
to be immediately murdered, till tney fetched the old Man, Friday's
Father, who immediately let them know that the five Men, who had
fetched them out one by one, had chosen them for their Wives.
When they had done, and the Fright the Women were in was a
little over, the Men went to Work, and the Spaniards came and
helped them: and in a few Hours they had built them every one 9
new Hut, or Tent for their Lodging apart; for those they had already,
were crowded with their Tools, Household-Stuff, and Provision. The
three wicked Ones had pitched farthest off, and the two honest Ones
nearer, but both on the North Shore of the Island, so that they con-
tinu'd separate as before: And thus my Island was peopled in three
Places; and, as I might say, three Towns were begun to be planted.
And here it is very well worth observing, That as it often happens
in the World (what the wise Ends of God's Providence are in such a
Disposition of Things, I cannot say) the two honest Fellows had the
two worst Wives, and the three Reprobates, that were scarce worth
hanging, that were fit for nothing, and neither seemed bor n to do
themselves Good, or any one else, had three clever, diligent, carefc/
and ingenious Wives; not that the two first were ill Wives, as to theii
Temper or Humour; for all the five were most willing, quiet, passive.
and subjected Creatures, rather like Slaves than Wives; but my
Meaning is, they were not alike capable, ingenious, or industrious, or
alike cleanly and neat
Another Observation I must make, to the Honour of a diligent
Application on one Hand, and to the Disgrace of a slothful, negligent,
idle Temper, on the other, that when I came to the Place, and view'd
the several Improvements, Plantings, and Management of the several
little Colonies, the two Men had so far outgone the three, that there
was no Comparison. They had indeed both of them as much Ground
laid out for Corn as they wanted; and the Reason was, because, ac-
cording to my Rule, Nature dictated that it was to no Purpose to
sow more Corn than they wanted, but the Difference of the Cultiva-
tion, of the Planting, of the Fences, and indeed of everything else,
was easy to be seen at first View.
The two Men had innumerable young T/ees planted about their
Huts, that when you came to the Place, nothing was to be seen but a
Wood, and though they had twice had their Plantation demolish'd,
once by their own Countrymen, and once by the Enemy, as shall be
shown in its Place; yet they had restor'd all again, and everything
was thriving and flourishing about them; they had Grapes planted in
Order, and manag'd like a Vineyard, though they had themselves
never seen anything of that Kind; and by their good ordering their
Vines, their Grapes were as good again as any of the others. They
had also found themselves out a Retreat in the thickest Part of the
Woods, where, though there was not a natural Cave, as I had found,
yet they made one with incessant Labour of their Hands, and where
when the Mischief which follow'd happen'd, they secur'd their AVives
and Children, so as they could never be found; they having by stick-
ing innumerable Stakes and Poles of the Wood, which, as I said,
grew so easily, made the Wood unpassable, except in some Places,
where they climbed up to get over the outside Part, and then went on
by Ways of their own leaving.
As to the three Reprobates, as I justly call them, though they were
much civiliz'd by their new Settlement, compar'd to what they
were before, and were not so quarrelsome, having not the same Op-
portunity; yet one of the certain Companions of a profligate Mind
never left them, and that was their Idleness. It is true, they planted
Corn, and made Fences; but Solomon's Words were never better veri-
ryd than in them: I went by the Vineyard of the Slothful, and it wot
all overgrown with Thorns; for when the Spaniards came to view
their Crop, they could not see it in some Places for Weeds; the
Hedge had several Gaps in it, where the wild Goats had gotten in.
and eaten up the Corn; perhaps, here and there, a dead Bush was
crammed in, to stop them out for the Present, but it was only shutting
the Stable door after the Steed was stolen. Whereas, when they
looked on the Colony of the other two, there was the very Face of
Industry and Success upon all they did; there was not a Weed to be
seen in all their Corn, or a Gap in any of their Hedges: And they,
on the other Hand, verify'd Solomon's Words in another Place, That
the diligent Hand makes rich; for everything grew and thrived, and
they had Plenty within and without; they had more tame Cattle than
the other, more Utensils and Necessaries within Doors, and yet more
Pleasure and Diversion too.
It is true, the Wives of the three were very handy and cleanly
within Doors, and having learned the English Ways of Dressing and
Cooking from one of the other Englishmen, who, as I said, was Cook's-
mate on board the Ship, they dressed their Husbands' Victuals very
nicely and well; whereas the other could not be brought to under-
stand it; but then the Husband, who, as I say, had been Cook's-
mate, did it himself; but as for the Husbands of the three Wives,
they loiter'd about, fetched Turtles' Eggs, and caught Fish and Birds;
in a Word, anything but Labour, and they fared accordingly. The
Diligent lived well and comfortably, and the Slothful lived hard and
beggarly; and so I believe, generally speaking, it is all over the
World.
But now I come to a Scene, different from all that had happen'd
before, either to them, or to me; and the Original of the Story was
this:
Early one Morning there came on Shore five or six Canoes of In-
dians, or Savages, call them which you please; and there is no Room
to doubt that they came upon the old Errand of feeding upon their
Slaves: But that Part was now so familiar to the Spaniards, and to
our Men too, that they did not concern themselves about it, as I did;
but having been made sensible by their Experience, that their only
Business was to lie conceal'd, and that if they were not seen by any
of the Savages, they would go off again quietly when their Business
was done, having as yet not the least Notion of there Wing any Inha-
bitants in the Island; I say, having been made sensible of this, they
had nothing to do but to give Notice to all the three Plantations, to
keep within Doors, and not show themselves, only placing a Scout in
a proper Place, to give Notice when the Boats went to Sea again.
This was without doubt very right; but a Disaster spoilt all these
Measures, and made it known among the Savages, that there were
Inhabitants there, which was in the End the Desolation of almost the
whole Colony; after the Canoes with the Savages were gone off, the
Spaniards peeped abroad again, and some of them had the Curiosity
to go to the Place where they had been, to see what they had been
doing: Here, to their great Surprise, they found three Savages left
behind, and lying fast asleep upon the Ground; it was suppos'd, they
had either been so gorged with their inhuman Feast, that, like Beasts,
they were asleep, and would not stir when the others went, or they
were wander'd into the Woods, and did not come back in time to be
taken in.
The Spaniards were greatly surpris'd at this Sight, and perfectly at
a Loss what to do; the Spaniard Governor, as it happen'd, was with
them, and his Advice was asked, but he profess'd he knew not what
to do; as for Slaves, they had enough already, and as to killing
them, they were none of them inclin'd to that; the Spaniard
Governor told me, they could not think of shedding innocent Blood,
for as to them, the poor Creatures had done them no Wrong, in-
vaded none of their Property, and they thought they had no just
Quarrel against them, to take away their Lives.
And here I must, in Justice to these Spaniards, observe, that let
the Accounts of Spanish Cruelty in Mexico and Peru be what they
will, I never met with seventeen Men of any Nation whatsoever, in
any foreign Country, who were so universally Modest, Temperate,
Virtuous, so very Good-humour'd, and so Courteous as these Spa-
niards; and as to Cruelty, they had nothing of it in their very
Nature, no Inhumanity, no Barbarity, no outrageous Passions, and
yet all of them Men of great Courage and Spirit
Their Temper and Calmness had appear'd in their bearing the un-
sufferable Usage of the three Englishmen; and their Justice and
Humanity appear'd now in the Case of the Savages, as above. After
some Consultation, they resolv'd upon this, that they would lie still a
while longer, till, if possible, these three Men might be gone; but
then the Governor Spaniard recollected, that the three Savages had
no Boat, and that if they were left to rove about the Island, they
would certainly discover that there were Inhabitants in it, and so
they should be undone that Way.
Upon this, they went back again, and there lay the Fellows fast
asleep still, so they resolv'd to waken them, and take them Prisoners,
and they did so; the poor Fellows were strangely frighted when
they were seized upon and bound, and afraid, like the Women, that
they should be murder'd and eaten; for it seems those People
think all the World does as they do, eating Men's Flesh; but
they were soon made easy as to that, and away they carry'd
them.
It was very happy to them that they did not carry them Home
to their Castle, I mean to my Palace under the Hill; but they
carry'd them first to the Bower, where was the chief of their Coun-
try-work, such as the keeping the Goats, the planting the Corn, cW.,
and aftenvards, they carry'd them to the Habitation of the two Eng-
lishmen.
Here they were set to work, though it was not much they had for
them to do; and whether it was by Negligence in guarding them, or
that they thought the Fellows could not mend themselves, I know
not, but one of th«m run away, and taking into the Woods, they could
never hear of him more.
They had good Reason to believe he got Home again soon after,
in some other Boats or Canoes of Savages, who came on Shore three
or four Weeks afterwards, and who, carrying on their Revels as usual,
went off again in two Days' time: This Thought terrify'd them ex-
ceedingly; for they concluded, and that not without good Cause
indeed, that if this Fellow came safe Home among his Comrades, he
would certainly give them an Account, that there were People in the
Island, as also how few and weak they were; for this Savage, as I
observ'd before, had never been told, and it was very happy he had
not, how many they were, or where they lived; nor had he ever seen
or heard the Fire of any of their Guns, much less had they shown
him any of their other retir'd Places; such as the Cave in the Valley,
or the new Retreat which the two Englishmen had made, and
the like.
The first Testimony they had that this Fellow had given Intelli-
gence of them, was, that about two Months after this, six Canoes of
Savages, with about seven, or eight, or ten Men in a Canoe, came
rowing along the North Side of the Island, where they never used to
come before, and landed about an Hour after Sunrise, at a conve-
nient Place, about a Mile from the Habitation of the two Englishmen
where this escap'd Man had been kept: As the Spaniard Governor
said, had they been all there, the Damage would not have been so
much, for not a Man of them would have escap'd; but the Case
differ'd now very much, for two Men to fifty was too much odds:
The two Men had the Happiness to discover them about a League
off, so that it was above an Hour before they landed, and as they
landed a Mile from their Huts, it was some time before they could
come at them: Now having great Reason to believe that they were
betray'd, the first Thing they did, was to bind the two Slaves which
were left, and cause two of the three Men, whom they brought with
the Women, who it seems proved very faithful to them, to lead them
with their two Wives, and whatever they could carry away with them,
to their retir'd Place in the Woods, which I have spoken of above,
and there to bind the two Fellows Hand and Foot till they heard
farther.
In the next Place, seeing the Savages were all come on Shore,
and that they bent their Course directly that Way, they opened the
I'ences where their Milch-Goats were kept, and drove them all out,
leaving their Goats to straggle into the Wood, whither they pleased,
that the Savages might think they were all bred wild; but the
Rogue who came with them was too cunning for that, and gave them
an Account of it all; for they went directly to the Place.
When the two poor frighted Men had secur'd their Wives and
Goods, they sent the other Slave they had of the three, who came
with the Women, and who was at their Place by Accident, away
to the Spaniard, with all Speed, to give them the Alarm, and de-
sire speedy Help; and in the meantime they took their Arms,
and what Ammunition they had, and retreated towards the Place
in the Wood, where their Wives were sent, keeping at a Distance,
yet so that they might see, if possible, which Way the Savages
took.
They had not gone far, but that, from a rising Ground, they
could see the little Army of their Enemies come on directly to
their Habitation, and in a Moment more could see all their Huts
and Household - Stuff flaming up together, to their great Grief
and Mortification; for they had a very great Loss, to them irre-
trievable, at least for some Time. They kept their Station for a
while, till they found the Savages, like wild Beasts, spread them-
selves all over the Place, rummaging every Way and every Place
they could think of, in Search for Prey, and in particular for the
People, of whom it now plainly appear'd they had Intelligence.
The two Englishmen seeing this, thinking themselves not secure
where they stood, because as it was likely some of the wild People
might come that Way, so they might come too many together,
thought it proper to make another Retreat about half a Mile farther,
believing, as it afterwards happen'd, that the farther they strolled, the
fewer would be together.
The next Halt was at the Entrance into a very thick grown Part of
the Woods, and where an old Trunk of a Tree stood, which was
hollow and vastly large; and in this Tree they both took their Stand-
ing, resolving to see there what might offer.
They had not stood there long, but two of the Savages appear'd
running directly that Way, as if they had already had Notice where
they stood, and were coming up to attack them; and a little Way
farther, they spied three more coming after them, and five more be-
yond them, all coming the same Way; besides which, they saw seven
or eight more at a Distance, running another Way; for in a Word,
they ran every Way like Sportsmen beating for their Game.
The poor Men were now in great Perplexity, whether they should
stand and keep their Posture, or fly: But after a very short Debate
with themselves, they consider'd, that if the Savages rang'd the
Country thus before Help came, they might perhaps find out their
Retreat in the Woods, then all would be lost; so they resolv'd to
Itand them there; and if they were too many to deal with, then
they would get up to the Top of the Tree, from whence they doubted
not to defend themselves, Fire excepted, as long as their Ammunition
lasted, though all the Savages that were landed, which was near fifty,
were to attack them.
Having resolv'd upon this, they next consider'd whether they
should fire at the first two, or wait for the three, and so take the
middle Party, by which the two and the five that follow'd would be
separated; and they resolv'd to let the two first pass by, unless they
should spy them in the Tree, and come to attack them. The tws
first Savages also confirm'd them in this Regulation, by turning a
little from them towards another Part of the Wood; but the three,
and the five after them, came forwards directly to the Tree, as if they
had known the Englishmen were there.
Seeing them come so straight towards them, they resolv'd to take
them in a Line, as they came; and as they resolv'd to fire but one
at a Time, perhaps the first Shot might hit them a!l three, to which
Purpose, the Man who was to fire put three or four Bullets
into his Piece, and having a fair Loop-hole, as it were, from a broken
Hole in the Tree, he took a sure Aim, without being seen, waiting
till they were wiUiin about thirty Yards of the Tree, so that he could
not miss.
While they were thus waiting, and the Savages came on, they
plainly saw that one of the three was the Runaway Savage that had
escap'd from them, and they both knew him distinctly, and resolv'd
that, if possible, he should not escape, though they should both fire;
so the other stood ready with his Piece, that if he did not drop at
the first Shot, he should be sure to have a second.
But the first was too good a Marksman to miss his Aim; for as
the Savages kept near one another, a little behind in a Line, in a
Word, he fired, and hit two of them directly: The foremost was
killed outright, being shot in the Head: The second, which was the
run-away Indian, was shot through the Body, and fell, but was not
quite dead: And the third had a little Scratch in the Shoulder,
perhaps by the same Ball that went through the Body of the second,
and being dreadfully frighted, though not much hurt, sat down
upon the Ground, screaming and yelling in a hideous manner.
The five that were behind, more frighted with the Noise than
sensible of the Danger, stood still at first; for the Woods made the
Sound a thousand Times bigger than it really was; the Echoes
rattling from one Side to another, and the Fowls rising from all Parts,
screaming and making, every Sort, a several Kind of Noise accord-
ing to their Kind, just as it was when I fired the first Gun that
perhaps was ever shot off in that Place since it was an Island.
However, all being silent again, and they not knowing what the
Matter was, came on unconcern'd, till they came to the Place where
their Companions lay in a Condition miserable enough: And here
me poor ignorant Creatures, not sensible that they were within Reach
of the same Mischief, stood all of a Huddle over the wounded Man,
talking, and, as may be suppos'd, inquiring of him, how he came to
be hurt; and who, it is very rational to believe, told them, that a
Flash of Fire first, and immediately after that, Thunder from their
Gods, had killed those two, and wounded him: This, I say, is rational;
for nothing is more certain than that, as they saw no Man near them,
so they had never heard a Gun in all their Lives, or so much as heard
of a Gun; neither knew they anything of killing or wounding, at a
Distance, with Fire and Bullets; if they had, one might reasonably
believe, they would not have stood so unconcern'd, in viewing the
Fate of their Fellows, without some Apprehension of their own.
Our two Men, though as they confess'd to me, it grieved them to
be oblig'd to kill so many poor Creatures, who, at the same Time, had
no Notion of their Danger; yet having them all thus in their Power,
and the first having loaded his Piece again, resolv'd to let fly both
together among them; and singling out, by Agreement, which to aim
at, they shot together, and killed or very much wounded four of
them; the fifth, frighted even to Death, though not hurt, fell with
the rest; so that our Men seeing them all fall together, thought they
had killed them all.
The Belief that the Savages were all killed, made our two Men
come boldly out of the Tree before they had charged their Guns
again, which was a wrong Step; and they were under some Surprise
when they came to the Place, and found no less than four of the
Men alive, and of them two very little hurt, and one not at all: This
oblig'd them to fall upon them with the Stocks of their Muskets; and
first they made sure of the run-away Savage, that had been the
Cause of all the Mischief, and of another that was hurt in his Knee,
and put them out of their Pain; then the Man that was not hurt at
all, came and kneeled down to them, with his two Hands held up,
and made piteous Moans to them by Gestures and Signs, for his
Life; but could not say one Word to them that they could under-
stand.
However, they signed to him to sit down at the Foot of a Tree
thereby; and one of the English>nen, with a Piece of Rope-Twine
which he had, by great Chance, in his Pocket, tied his two Feet fast
together, and his two Hands behind him, and there they left him;
and, with what Speed they could, made after the other two, which
were gone before; fearing they, or any more of them, should find the
Way to their cover'd Place in the Woods, where their Wives, and the
few Goods they had left, lay. They came once in Sight of the two
Men, but it was at a great Distance; however, they had the Satisfac-
tion to see them cross over a Valley towards the Sea, the quite
contrary Way from that which led to their Retreat, which they were
afraid of; and being satisfy'd with that, they went back to the
Tree, where they left their Prisoner, who, as they suppos'd, was
deliver'd by his Comrades; for he was gone, and the two Pieces of
Rope-Yarn, with which they had bound him, lay just at the Foot of
the Tree.
They were now in as great a Concern as before, not knowing what
Course to take, or how near the Enemy might be, or in what
Numbers; so they resolv'd to go away to the Place where their Wives
were, to see if all was well there, and to make them easy, who were
in Fright enough to be sure; for though the Savages were their own
Country Folk, yet they were most terribly afraid of them, and perhaps
the more, for the Knowledge they had of them.
When they came there, they found the Savages had been in the
Wood, and very near that Place, but had not found it; for it was
indeed inaccessible, by the Trees standing so thick, as before, had
not the Persons seeking it been directed by those that knew it, which
these did not; they found therefore everything very safe, only the
Women in a terrible Fright: While they were here, they had the
Comfort to have seven of the Spaniards come to their Assistance;
the other ten, with their Servants, and old Friday, I mean Friday's
Father, were gone in a Body to defend their Bower, and the Corn,
and Cattle that was kept there, in Case the Savages should have
roved over to that Side of the Country; but they did not spread so
far. With the seven Spaniards came one of the three Savages, who,
as I said, were their Prisoners formerly; and with them also came
the Savage, whom the Englishmen had left bound Hand and Foot
at the Tree; for it seems they came that Way, saw the Slaughter of
the seven Men, and unbound the eighth, and brought him along with
them; where, however, they were oblig'd to bind him again, as they
had the two others, who were left when the third run away. -
The Prisoners began now to be a Burden to them; and they were
so afraid of their escaping, that they were once resolving to kill them
all, believing they were under an absolute Necessity to do so, for
their own Preservation: However, the Spaniard Governor would not
consent to it, but order'd for the present that they should be sent
out of the Way to my old Cave in the Valley, and be kept there with
two Spaniards to guard them, and give them Food for their Subsistence,
which was done; and they were bound there Hand and Foot for that
Night
When the Spaniards came, the two Englishmen were so encourag'd
that they could not satisfy themselves to stay any longer there; but
taking five of the Spaniards, and themselves, with four Muskets and
a Pistol among them, and two stout Quarter-Staves, away they went
in Quest of the Savages. And first they came to the Tree where the
Men lay that had been killed; but it was easy to see that some more
of the Savages had been there; for they had attempted to cany their
dead Men away, and had dragged two of them a good Way, but had
given it over. From thence they advanc'd to the first rising Ground,
where they stood, and saw their Camp destroy'd, and where they had
the Mortification still to see some of the Smoke; but neither could they
here see any of the Savages: Then they resolv'd, though with all
possible Caution, to go forward towards their ruin'd Plantation: But
a little before they came thither, coming in Sight of the Sea Shore,
they saw plainly the Savages all embarking again in their Canoes, in
order to be gone.
They seemed sorry at first; and there was no Way to come at
them, to give them a parting Blow: But upon the whole, were very
well satisfy'd to be rid of them.
The poor Englishmen being now twice ruin'd, and all their Im-
provement destroy'd, the rest all agreed to come and help them
rebuild, and to assist them with needful Supplies. Their three
Countrymen, who were not yet noted for having the least Inclination to
do any Good, yet as soon as they heard of it (for they living remote
Eastward, knew nothing of the Matter till all was over) came and
offer'd their Help and Assistance, and did very friendly work for
several Days, to restore their Habitation, and make Necessaries for
them: And thus, in a little Time, they were set upon their Legs
again.
About two Days after this, they had the farther Satisfaction of
seeing three of the Savages' Canoes come driving on Shore, and at
some Distance from them, two drowned Men; by which they had
Reason to believe, that they had met with a Storm at Sea, and had
overset some of them; for it had blown very hard the very Night
after they went off.
However, as some might miscarry, so on the other Hand, enough
of them escap'd to inform the rest, as well of what they had done, as
of what had happen'd to them; and to whet them on to anothei
Enterprise of the same Nature, which they, it seems, resolv'd to
attempt, with sufficient Force to carry all before them; for except
what the first Man had told them of Inhabitants, they could say little
to it of their own Knowledge; for they never saw one Man, and the
Fellow being killed that had affirm'd it, they had no other Witness
to confirm it to them.
It was five or six Months after this before they heard any more of
the Savages; in which Time our Men were in Hopes they had either
forgot their former bad Luck, or given over the Hopes of better;
when on a sudden they were invaded with a most formidable
Fleet, of no less than eight-and-twenty Canoes full of Savages,
armed with Bows and Arrows, great Clubs, wooden Swords,
and such like Engines of War; and they brought such Numbers
with them, that, in short, it put all our People into the utmost
Consternation.
As they came on Shore in the Evening, and at the Easternmost
Side of the Island, our Men had that Night to consult and consider
what to do; and, in the first Place, knowing that their being entirely
conceal'd was their only Safely before, and would much more be so
now, while the Number of their Enemies was so great, they therefore
resolv'd first of all to take down the Huts which were built for the
two Englishmen, and drive away their Goats to the old Cave; because
they suppos'd the Savages would go directly thither, as soon as it was
Day, to play the old Game over again, though they did not now land
within two Leagues of it
In the next Place, they drove away all the Flock of Goats they had
at the old Bower, as I called it, which belong'd to the Spaniards;
and in short, left as little Appearance of Inhabitants anywhere as was
possible; and the next Morning early they posted themselves with
all their Force at the Plantation of the two Men, waiting for their
Coming: As they guessed, so it happen'd; these new Invaders
leaving their Canoes at the East End of the Island, came ranging
along the Shore directly towards the Place, to the Number of two-
hundred-and-fifty, as near as our Men could judge. Our Army was
but small indeed; but that which was worse, they had not Arms for
all their Number neither: The whole Account, it seems, stood thua;
First, as to the men.
:j Spaniards.
$ Englishmen.
i Old Friday, or Friday's Father.
3 The three Slaves taken with the Women, who proved very
faithful.
3 Other Slaves who lived with the Spaniards.
To arm these, they had,
ii Muskets.
5 Pistols.
3 Fowling Pieces.
5 Muskets or Fowling Pieces, which were taken by me from
the mutinous Seamen, whom I reduc'd.
2 Swords, 3 old Halberds.
To their Slaves they did not give either Musket or Fusee, but they
had every one a Halberd, or a long Staff, like a Quarter-Staff, with a
great Spike of Iron fasten'd into each End of it, and by his Side a
Hatchet; also every one of our Men had Hatchets : Two of the Women
could not be prevail'd upon but they would come into the Fight;
and they had Bows and Arrows, which the Spaniards had taken from
the Savages, when the first Action happen'd, which I have spoken of,
where the Indians fought with one another, and the Women
Hatchets too.
The Spaniard Governor, whom I have describ'd so often, commanded
the whole; and William Atkins, who though a dreadful Fellow for
Wickedness, was a most daring bold Fellow, commanded under him.
The Savages came forward like Lions, and our Men, which was the
worst of their Fate, had no Advantage in their Situation; only that
Will Atkins, who now proved a very useful Fellow, with six Men,
was planted just behind a small Thicket of Bushes, as an advanc'd
Guard, with Orders to let the first of them pass by, and then fire into
the Middle of them; and, as soon as he had fired, to make his Retreat
as nimble as he could round a Part of the Wood, and so come in
behind the Spaniards where they stood, having a Thicket of Trees
all before them.
When the Savages came on, they ran straggling about every Way
in Heaps, out of all manner of Order, and W. Atkins let about
349
fifty of them pass by him, then seeing the rest come in a very thick
Throng, he orders three of his Men to fire, having loaded their
Muskets with six or seven Bullets apiece, about as big as large Pistol
Bullets. How many they killed or wounded they knew not, but the
Consternation and Surprise was inexpressible among the Savages;
they were frighted to the last Degree, to hear such a dreadful Noise,
and see their Men killed, and others hurt, but see nobody that did it;
when in the Middle of their Fright, W. Atkins and his other
three let fly again among the thickest of them; and in less than a
Minute the first three, being loaded again, gave them a third
Volley.
Had W. Alkins and his Men retir'd immediately, as soon as they
had fired, as they were order'd to do; or had the rest of the
Body been at Hand to have poured in their Shot continually, the
Savages had been effectually routed; for the Terror that was among
them came principally from this, (viz.) That they were killed by the
Gods with Thunder and Lightning, and could see nobody that hurt
them; but W. Atkins staying to load again, discover'd the Cheat
Some of the Savages who were at a Distance, spying them, came
upon them behind, and though Atkins and his Men fired at them also,
two or three Times, and killed above twenty, retiring as fast as they
could, yet they wounded Atkins himself, and killed one of his Fellow
Englishmen with their Arrows, as they did afterwards one Spaniard,
and one of the Indian Slaves who came with the Women; this
Slave was a most gallant Fellow, and fought most desperately, killing
five of them with his own Hand, having no Weapon, but one of tbr
armed Staves and a Hatchet
Our Men being thus hard laid at, Atkins wounded, and two othei
Men killed, retreated to a rising Ground in the Wood, and the
Spaniards after firing three "Volleys upon them retreated also; for
their Number was so great, and they were so desperate, that though
above fifty of them were killed, and more than so many wounded, yet
they came on in the Teeth of our Men, fearless of Danger, and shot
their Arrows like a Cloud; and it was observ'd that their wounded
Men, who were not quite disabled, were made outrageous by their
Wounds, and fought like Madmen.
When our Men retreated, they left the Spaniard and the English-
man that was killed behind them; and the Savages, when they came
up to them, killed them over again in a wretched Manner, breaking
35<>
ADVENTURES OF
the Anns, Legs, and Heads with their Clubs and wooden Swords,
like true Savages: But rinding our Men were gone, they did not seem
to pursue them, but drew themselves up in a kind of a Ring, which
is, it seems, their Custom, and shouted twice in Token of their Vic-
tory: After which, they had the Mortification to see several of their
wounded Men fall, dying with the mere Loss of Blood.
The Spaniard Governor having drawn his little Body up together
upon a rising Ground, Atkins, though he was wounded, would have
had him march, and charge them again all together at once: But the
Spaniard reply'd, Seignior Atkins, you see how their wounded Men
fight, let them alone till Morning; all these wounded Men will be
stiff and sore with their Wounds, and faint with the Loss of Blood;
and so we shall have the fewer to engage.
The Advice was good: But Will Atkins reply'd merrily, That's
true, Seignior, and so shall I too; and that's the Reason I would go
on while I am warm. Well, Seignior Atkins, says the Spaniard, you
have behav'd gallantly, and done your Part; we will fight for you, if
you cannot come on, but I think it best to stay till Morning; so they
waited.
But as it was a clear Moonlight Night, and they found the Savages
in great Disorder about their dead and wounded Men, and a great
Hurry and Noise among them where they lay, they afterwards resolv'd
to fall upon them in the Night, especially if they could come to give
them but one Volley before they were discover'd, which they had a
fair Opportunity to do; for one of the two Englishmen, in whose
Quarter it was where the Fight began, led them round between the
Woods and Seaside Westward, and then turning short South, they
came so near where the thickest of them lay, that before they were seen
or heard, eight of them fired in among them, and did dreadful Execu-
tion upon them; in half a Minute more, eight others fired after
them, pouring in their small Shot in such a Quantity, that Abundance
were killed and wounded; and all this while they were not able to
see who hurt them, or which Way to fly.
The Spaniards charged again with the utmost Expedition, and then
divided themselves into three Bodies, and resolv'd to fall in among
them all together: They had in each Body eight Persons, that is to
say 24, whereof were a a Men, and the 2 Women, who by the Way
fought desperately.
They divided the Firearms equally in each Party, and so of the
nonrNsoN cjh/soh.

Halberds and Staves: They would have had the Women keep back,
but they said they were resolv'd to die with their Husbands: Having
thus formed their little Army they marched out from among the
Trees, and they came up to the Teeth of the Enemy, shouting and hallow-
ing as loud as they could; the Savages stood all together, but were
in the utmost Confusion, hearing the Noise of our Men shouting from
three Quarters together; they would have fought if they had seen us:
And as soon as we came near enough to be seen, some Arrows were
shot, and poor old Friday was wounded, though not dangerously: But
our Men gave them no Time; but running up to them, fired among
them three Ways, and then fell in with the Butt-ends of their Muskets,
their Swords, armed Staves, and Hatchets, and laid about them so
well, that, in a Word, they set up a dismal Screaming and Howling,
flying to save their Lives which Way soever they could.

Our Men were tirea wvrn tne Execution; and Knied, or morcany
wounded, in the two Fights, about 180 of them; the rest, being
frighted out of their Wits, scoured through the Woods, and over the
Hills, with all the Speed and Fear that nimble Feet could help them
to do; and as we did not trouble ourselves much to pursue them,
they got all together to the Seaside, where they landed, and where
their Canoes lay. But their Disaster was not at an End yet; for it
blew a terrible Storm of Wind that Evening from the Seaward, so that
it was impossible for them to go off; nay, the Storm continuing all
Night, when the Tide came up, their Canoes were most of them
driven by the Surge of the Sea so high upon the Shore, that it requir'd
infinite Toil to get them off; and some of them were even dashed to
Pieces against the Beach, or against one another.
Our Men, though glad of their Victory, yet got little Rest thai
v u
Night; but having refresh'd themselves as well as they could, they
resolv'd to march to that Part of the Island where the Savages were
fled, and see what Posture they were in. This necessarily led them
over the Place where the Fight had been, and where they found
several of the poor Creatures not quite dead, and yet past recovering
Life; a Sight disagreeable enough to generous Minds; for a truly
great Man, though obliged by the Law of Battle to destroy his
Enemy, takes no Delight in his Misery.
However, there was no Need to give any Orders in this Case; for
their own Savages, who were their Servants, dispatch'd those pool
Creatures with their Hatchets.
At length they came in View of the Place where the more miserable
Remains of the Savages' Army lay, where there appear'd about an
hundred still; their Posture was generally sitting upon the Ground,
with their Knees up towards their Mouth, and the Head put between
the two Hands, leaning down upon the Knees.
When our Men came within two Musket Shot of them, the Spaniard
Governor ordered two Muskets to be fired without Ball, to alarm
them; this he did, that by their Countenance he might know what to
expect, viz. Whether they were still in Heart to fight, or were so
heartily beaten, as to be dispirited and discourag'd, and so he might
manage accordingly.
This Stratagem took; for, as soon as the Savages heard the first
Gun, and saw the Flash of the Second, they started up upon their
Feet in the greatest Consternation imaginable; and as our Men ad-
vanc'd swiftly towards them, they all ran screaming and yawling away,
with a Kind of a howling Noise, which our Men did not understand,
and had never heard before; and thus they ran up the Hills into the
Country.
At first, our Men had much rather the Weather had been calm, and
they had all gone away to Sea: But they did not then consider that
this might probably have been the Occasion of their coming again in
such Multitudes, as not to be resisted, or, at least, to come so many
and so often, as would quite desolate the Island, and starve them:
Will Atkiiis therefore, who, notwithstanding his Wound, kept always
with them, proved the best Counsellor in this Case: His Advice was,
to take the Advantage that offer'd, and clap in between them and
their Boats, and so deprive them of the Capacity of ever returning any
more to plague the Island.
They consulted long about this, and some were against it, for feai
jf making the Wretches fly to the Woods, and live there desperate;
and so they should have them to hunt like wild Beasts, be afraid to
stir out about their Business, and have their Plantations continually
rifled, and their tame Goats destroy'd, and, in short, be reduc'd to a
Life of continual Distress.
Will Atkins told them they had better have to do with a hundred
Men, than with a hundred Nations: That as they must destroy their
Boats, so they must destroy the Men, or be all of them destroy'd
themselves. In a Word, he showed them the Necessity of it so
plainly, that they all came into it; so they went to work immediately
with the Boats, and getting some dry Wood together from a dead
Tree, they tried to set some of them on Fire, but they were so wet,
that they would not burn; however, the Fire so burned the uppdT
Part, that it soon made them unfit for swimming in the Sea as Boats.
When the Indians saw what they were about, some of them came
running out of the Woods, and coming as near as they could to our
Men, kneeled down, and cried, Oa, Oa, Waramokoa, and some other
Words of their Language, which none of the others understood any-
thing of; but as they made pitiful Gestures, and strange Noises, it
was easy to understand, they begged to have their Boats spared, and
that they would be gone, and never come there again.
But our Men were now satisfy'd, that they had no Way to preserve
themselves, or to save the Colony, but effectually to prevent any of
these People from ever going Home again; depending upon this,
that if ever so much as one of them got back into their Country to tell
the Story, the Colony was undone; so that letting them know that
they should not have any Mercy, they fell to work with their Canoes,
and destroy'd them every one, that the Storm had not destroy'd before;
at the Sight of which, the Savages raised a hideous Cry in the Woods
which our People heard plain enough; after which, they ran about the
Island like distracted Men; so that, in a Word, our Men did not
really know at first what to do with them.
Nor did the Spaniards, with all their Prudence, consider, that
while they made those People thus desperate, they ought to have
kept good Guard at the same Time upon their Plantations; for
though it is true, they had driven away their Cattle, and the Indians
did not find out their main Retreat, I mean my old Castle at the Hill,
nor the Cave in the Valley, yet they found out my Plantation at tne
Bower, and pulled it all to Pieces, and all the Fences and Planting
about it; trod all the Corn under Foot; tore up the Vines and
Grapes, being just then almost ripe, and did to our men an inestimable
Damage, though to themselves not one Farthing's worth of Service.
Though our Men were able to fight them upon all Occasions, yet
they were in no Condition to pursue them, or hunt them up and down;
for as they were too nimble of Foot for our Men, when they found
them single, so our Men durst not go about single, for fear of being
surrounded with their Numbers. The best was, they had no Weapons,
for though they had Bows they had no Arrows left, nor any Materials
to make any, nor had they any edged Tool or Weapon among them.
The Extremity and Distress they were reduc'd to was great, and
indeed deplorable; but at the same Time, our Men were also
brought to very bad Circumstances by them; for though their Re-
treats were preserv'd, yet their Provision was destroy'd, and their
Harvest spoil'd, and what to do, or which Way to turn themselves,
they knew not: The only Refuge they had now, was the Stock of
Cattle they had in the Valley by the Cave, and some little Com
which grew there; and the Plantation of the three Englishmen, Wil-
liam Atkins and his Comrades, who were now reduc'd to two, one of
them being killed by an Arrow which struck him on the Side of his
Head, just under the Temple, so that he never spoke more; and it
was very remarkable, that this was the same barbarous Fellow who
cut the poor Savage Slave with his Hatchet, and who afterwards in-
tended to have murder'd all the Spaniards.
I looked upon their Case to have been worse at this Time, than
mine was at any Time, after I first discover'd the Grains of Barley
and Rice, and got into the Manner of planting and raising my Corn,
and my tame Cattle; for now they had, as I may say, a hundred
Wolves upon the Island, which would devour everything they could
come at, yet could very hardly be come at themselves.
The first Thing they concluded, when they saw what their Circum-
stances were, was, that they would, if possible, drive them up to the
farther Part of the Island, South-West, that if any more Savages came
on Shore, they might not find one another. Then, that they would daily
hunt and harass them, and kill as many of them as they could come
at, till they had reduc'd their Number; and if they could at last tame
them, and bring them to anything, they would give them Cora, and
teach them how to plant and live upon their daily Labour.
355
In order to this, they so follow'd them, and so terrify'd them with
their Guns, that in a few Days, if any of them fired a Gun at an
Indian, if he did not hit him, yet he would fall down for Fear; and
so dreadfully frighted they were, that they kept out of Sight farther
and farther, till at last our Men following them, and every Day al-
most killing and wounding some of them, they kept up in the Woods
and hollow Places so much, that it reduc'd them to the utmost Misery
for want of Food, and many were afterwards found dead in the Woods,
without any Hurt, but merely starved to Death.
When our Men found this, it made their Hearts relent, and Pity
moved them; especially the Spaniard Governor, who was the most
gentlemanly, generous-minded Man that ever I met with in my Life;
and he propos'd, if possible, to take one of them alive, and bring him
to understand what they meant, so far as to be able to act as Inter-
preter, and to go among them, and see if they might be brought to
some Conditions that might be depended upon, to save their Lives
and to do us no Spoil.
It was some while before any of them could be taken; but being
weak and half starved, one of them was at last surpris'd and made a
Prisoner; he was sullen at first, and would neither eat or drink,
but finding himself kindly used, and Victuals given him, and no
Violence offer'd him, he at last grew tractable, and came to him-
self.
They brought old Friday to him, who talked often with him, and
told him how kind the others would be to them all; that they would
not only save their Lives, but would give them a Part of the Island
to live in, provided they would give Satisfaction that they would keep
in their own Bounds, and not come beyond it, to injure or prejudice
others, and that they should have Corn given them, to plant and
make it grow for their Bread, and some Bread given them for their
present Subsistence; and old Friday bad the Fellow go and talk
with the rest of his Countrymen, and see what they said to it, assur-
ing them, that if they did not agree immediately, they should be all
destroy'd.
The poor Wretches, thoroughly humbled, and reduc'd in Number
Jo about thirty-seven, closed with the Proposal at the first Offer, and
begged to have some Food given them; upon which, twelve Spaniards
and two Englishmen, well armed, with three Indian Slaves, and old
Friday, marched to the Place where thev were: the three Tn linn
Slaves carry'd them a large Quantity of Bread; some Rice boiled up
to Cakes, and dried in the Sun, and three live Goats; and they were
order'd to go to the Side of a Hill, where they sat down, eat the Pro-
visions very thankfully, and were the most faithful Fellows to their
Words that could be thought of; for except when they came to beg
Victuals and Directions, they never came out of their Bounds;
and there they lived when I came to the Island, and I went to see
them.
They had taught them both to plant Corn, make Bread, bree<f
tame Goats and milk them; they wanted nothing but Wives, and
they soon would have been a Nation. They were confin'd to a Neck
of Land, surrounded with high Rocks behind them, and lying plain
towards the Sea before them, on the South-East Corner of the Island:
They had Land enough, and it was very good and fruitful; they had
a Piece of Land about a Mile and half broad, and three or four
Mile in Length.
Our Men taught them to make wooden Spades, such as I made
for myself, and gave them among them twelve Hatchets and three 01
four Knives; and there they lived the most subjected innocent
Creatures that ever were heard of.
After this, the Colony enjoy'd a perfect Tranquillity with Respect
to the Savages, till I came to revisit them, which was above two
Years: Not but that now and then some Canoes of Savages came
on Shore for their triumphal unnatural Feasts, but as they were of
several Nations, and perhaps had never heard of those that came
before, or the Reason of it, they did not make any Search or Inquiry
after their Countrymen; and if they had, it would have been very
hard to have found them out
Thus, I think, I have given a full Account of all that happen'd to
them, to my Return, at least that was worth Notice. The Indians or
Savages were wonderfully civiliz'd by them, and they frequently went
among them, but forbid, on Pain of Death, any one of the Indians
coming to them, because they would not have their Settlement be-
tray'd again.
One Thing was very remarkable, viz. that they taught the
Savages to make Wickerwork, or Baskets; but they soon outdid
their Masters; for they made abundance of most ingenious Things
in Wickerwork; particularly, all Sorts of Baskets, Sieves, Bird-Cages,
Cupboards, &*c, as also Chairs to sit on, Stools, Beds, Couches, and
abundance of other Things, being very ingenious at such Work, when
they were once put in the Way of it
My coming was a particular Relief to these People, because we
furnish'd them with Knives, Scissors, Spades, Shovels, Pick-axes, and
all Things of that Kind which they could want
With the Help of these Tools they were so very handy, that they
came at last to build up their Huts, or our Houses, very handsomely;
raddling or working it up like Basket-work all the way round, which
was a very extraordinary Piece of Ingenuity, and looked very odd,
but was an exceeding good Fence, as well against Heat, as against aU
Sorts of Vermin; and our Men were so taken with it, that they got
the wild Savages to come and do^he like for them; so that when I
came to see the two Englishmen's Colonies, they looked, at a Dis-
tance, as if they lived all like Bees in a Hive; and as for Will
Atkins, who was now become a very industrious, necessary, and sober
Fellow, he had made himself such a Tent of Basket-work as I believe
was never seen; it was r2o Paces round in the Outside, as I mea-
sur'd by my Steps ; the Walls were as close worked as a Basket, in Pa-
nels or Squares of 32 in Number, and very strong, standing about
seven Foot high; in the middle was another not above 22 Paces
round, but built stronger, being Eight-square in its Form, and in the
eight Corners stood eight very strong Posts, round the Top of which
he laid strong Pieces pinned together with wooden Pins, from which
he raised a Pyramid for the Roof of eight Rafters, very handsome,
I assure you, and joined together very well, though he had no Nails,
and only a few iron Spikes, which he made himself too, out of the
old Iron that I had left there; and indeed this Fellow showed abun-
dance of Ingenuity in several Things which he had no Knowledge
of; he made him a Forge, with a Pair of wooden Bellows to blow
the Fire; he made himself Charcoal for his Work, and he formed out
of one of the Iron Crows a middling good Anvil to hammer upon;
in this Manner he made many Things, but especially Hooks, Staples
and Spikes, Bolts and Hinges. But to return to the House; after
he had pitched the Roof of his innermost Tent, he worked it up be-
tween the Rafters with Basket-work so firm, and thatched that over
again so ingeniously with Rice-straw, and over that a large Leaf of a
Tree, which cover'd the Top, that his House was as dry as if it had
been tiled or slated. Indeed he owned that the Savages made the
Basket-work for him.
The outer Circuit was cover'd, as a Lean-to, all round this inna
Apartment, and long Rafters lay from the two-and-thirty Angles to
the top Posts of the inner House, being about twenty Foot Distance;
so that there was a Space like a Walk within the outer wicker Wall,
and without the inner, near twenty Foot wide.
The inner Place he partition'd off with the same Wickerwork, but
much fairer, and divided it into six Apartments, so that he had six
Rooms on a Floor; and out of every one of these there was a Door,
first into the Entry or Coming into the main Tent, and another Door
into the Space or Walk that was round it; so that Walk was also
divided into six equal Parts, which served not only for Retreat, but
to store up any Necessaries which the Family had Occasion for.
These six Spaces not taking up the whole Circumference, what other
Apartments the outer Circle had were thus order'd: As soon as you
were in at the Door of the outer Circle, you had a short Passage
straight before you to the Door of the inner House, but on either
side was a Wicker Partition, and a Door in it, by which you
went, first into a large Room or Storehouse, twenty Foot wide
and about thirty Foot long, and through that into another
not quite so long; so that in the outer Circle was ten handsome
Rooms, six of which were only to be come at through the Apartments
of the inner Tent, and served as Closets or retiring Rooms to th«*
respective Chambers of the inner Circle; and four large Warehouses
or Barns, or what you please to call them, which went in through one
another, two on either Hand of the Passage that led through the
outer Door to the inner Tent
Such a Piece of Basket-work, I believe, was never seen in the
World, nor a House, or Tent, so neatly contriv'd, much less, so
built In this great Beehive lived the three Families, that is to say,
Will Atkins and his Companion; the third was killed, but his Wife
remain'd with three Children; for she was, it seems, big with Child
when he died, and the other two were not at all backward to give the
Widow her full Share of everything, I mean, as to their Corn, Milk,
Grapes, drc, and when they killed a Kid, or found a Turtle on the
Shore; so that they all lived well enough, though it was true they
were not so industrious as the other two, as has been observ'd al-
ready.
One Thing, however, cannot be omitted, viz. That as for Religion,
I don't know that there was anything of that Kind among them)
they pretty often indeed put one another in Mind that there was a
God, by the very common Method of Seamen, viz. Swearing by .is
Name: Nor were their poor ignorant savage Wives much the better for
having been marry'd to Christians, as we must call them; for as they
knew very little of God themselves, so they were utterly incapable of
entering into any Discourse with their Wives about a God, or to talk
anything to them concerning Religion.
The utmost of all the Improvement which I can say the Wives
had made from them was, that they had taught them to speak Eng-
lish pretty well, and all the Children they had, which were near 20 in
all, were taught to speak English too, from their first learning to speak,
though they at first spoke it in a very broken Manner, like their Mothers.
There were none of these Children above six years old when I came
thither, for it was not much above seven Years that they had fetched
these five savage Ladies over, but they had all been pretty fruitful,
for they had all Children, more or less: I think the Cook's Mate's
Wife was big of her sixth Child; and the Mothers were all a good
Sort of well-govern'd, quiet, laborious Women, modest and decent,
helpful to one another; mighty observant and subject to their Masters,
I cannot call them Husbands; and wanted nothing but to be well
instructed in the Christian Religion, and to be legally marry'd; both
which were happily brought about afterwards by my Means, or, at
least, in Consequence of my Coming among them.
Having thus given an Account of the Colony in general, and pretty
much of my five Runagate Englishmen, I must say something of the
Spaniards, who were the main Body of the Family; and in whose
Story there are some Incidents also remarkable enough.
I had a great many Discourses with them about their Circum-
stances when they were among the Savages: They told me readily,
that they had no Instances to give of their Application or Ingenuity
in that Country; that they were a poor miserable dejected Handful
of People; that if Means had been put into their Hands, they had
yet so abandon'd themselves to Despair, and so sunk under the
Weight of their Misfortunes, that they thought of nothing but Starv-
ing: One of them, a grave and very sensible Man, told me he was
convinc'd they were in the Wrong; that it was not the Part of wise
Men to give up themselves to their Misery, but always to take Hold ol
the Helps which Reason offer'd, as well for present Support as for future
Deliverance. He told me that Grief was the most senseless insigni-
ficant Passion in the World; for that it regarded only Things past,
which were generally impossible to be recall'd or to be remedy'd, but
had no View to Things to come, and had no Share in anything that looked
like Deliverance, but rather added to the Affliction than propos'd a
Remedy: And upon this, he repeated a Spanish Proverb; which
though I cannot repeat in just the same Words that he spoke
in, yet I remember I made it into an English Proverb of my own,
thus:
In Trouble to be troulfd,
It to have your Trouble doubCd.
He ran on then in Remarks upon all the little Improvements I had
made in my Solitude; my unweary'd Application, as he called it,
and how I had made a Condition, which, in its Circumstances, was at
first much worse than theirs a thousand Times, more happy than theirs
was, even now, when they were all together. He told me it was remark-
able that Englishmen had a greater Presence of Mind in their Dis-
tress than any People that ever he met with; that their unhappy
Nation, and the Portuguese, were the worst Men in the World to
struggle with Misfortunes; for that their first Step in Dangers, after the
common Efforts are over, was always to despair, lie down under it,
and die, without rousing their Thoughts up to proper Remedies
for Escape.
I told him their Case and mine differ'd exceedingly, that they were
cast upon the Shore without Necessaries, without Supply of Food,
or of present Sustenance, till they could provide : That it is true, I had
this Disadvantage and Discomfort, that I was alone; but then the
Supplies I had providentially thrown into my Hands, by the unex-
pected driving of the Ship on Shore, was such a Help as would have
encourag'd any Creature in the World to have apply'd himself as I
had done. Seignior, says the Spaniard, had we poor Spaniards been
in your Case, we should never have gotten half those Things out of
the Ship as you did: Nay, says he, we should never have found
Means to have gotten a Raft to carry them, or to have gotten
the Raft on Shore 'without Boat or Sail; and how much less should
we have done, said he, if any of us had been alone? Well, I desi^d
him to abate his Compliment, and go on with the History of their
coming on Shore, where they landed: He told me they unhappily
landed »X a Place where there were People without Provisions -
whereas had they had the common Sense to have put off to Sea
Itgain, and gone to another Island a little farther, they had found
Provisions, though without People; there being an Island that Way,
as they had been told, where there was Provisions, though no People;
that is to say, that the Spaniards of Trinidad had frequently been
there, and had filled the Island with Goats and Hogs at several Times;
where they have bred in such Multitudes, and where Turtle and Sea-
Fowls were in such Plenty, that they could have been in no Want of
Flesh, though they had found no Bread; whereas here, they were
only sustain'd with a few Roots and Herbs, which they understood
not, and which had no Substance in them, and which the Inhabitants
gave them sparingly enough, and who could treat them no better,
unless they would turn Cannibals, and eat Men's Flesh, which was
the great Dainty of their Country.
They gave me an Account how many Ways they strove to civilize
the Savages they were with, and to teach them rational Customs in the
ordinary Way of Living, but in vain; and how they retorted it upon
them as unjust, that they who came there for Assistance and Support,
should attempt to set up for Instructors of those that gave them
Bread; intimating, it seems, that none should set up for the Instruc-
tors of others, but those who could live without them.
They gave me dismal Accounts of the Extremities they were driven
to; how sometimes they were many Days without any Food at all;
the Island they were upon being inhabited by a Sort of Savages that
lived more indolent, and for that Reason were less supplied with the
Necessaries of Life, than they had Reason to believe others were in
the same Part of the World; and yet they found, that these Savages
were less ravenous and voracious, than those who had better Supplies
of Food.
Also they added, That they could not but see with what Demon-
strations of Wisdom and Goodness the governing Providence of God
directs the Events of Things in the World; which, they said, appear'd
in their Circumstances; for if, pressed by the Hardships they were
under, and the Barrenness of the Country where they were, they had
searched after a better Place to live in, they had then been out ol
the Way of the Relief that happen'd to them by my Means.
Then they gave me an Account how the Savages, whom they lived
among, expected them to go out with them into their Wars: And h
was true that, as they had Firearms with them, had they not had the
Disaster to lose their Ammunition, they should not have been ser-
viceable only to their Friends, but have made themselves terrible
both to Friends and Enemies; but being without Powder and Shot,
and yet in a Condition that they could not in Reason deny to go out
with their Landlords to their Wars; when they came into the P teld
of Battle, they were in a worse Condition than the Savages themselves,
for they neither had Bows or Arrows, nor could they use those the
Savages gave them; so that they could do nothing but stand still, and
be wounded with Arrows, till they came up to the Teeth of their
Enemy, and then indeed the three Halberts they had were of Use
to them; and they would often drive a whole little Army before them
with those Halberds and sharpen'd Sticks put into the Muzzles of their
Muskets: But that for all this they were sometimes surrounded with
Multitudes, and in great Danger from their Arrows, till at last they
found the Way to make themselves large Targets of Wood, which
they cover'd with Skins of wild Beasts, whose Names they knew not;
and these cover'd them from the Arrows of the Savages; that not-
withstanding these, they were sometimes in great Danger, and were
once five of them knocked down together with the Clubs of the
Savages, which was the Time when one of them was taken Prisoner;
that is to say, the Spaniard whom I had reliev'd, that at first they
thought had been killed: But when afterwards they heard he was taken
Prisoner, they were under the greatest Grief imaginable, and would
willingly have ventur'd their Lives to have rescu'd him.
They told me that when they were so knocked down, the rest of
their Company rescu'd them, and stood over them, fighting till they
were come to themselves, all but him who they thought had been
dead; and then they made their Way with their Halberds and Pieces,
standing close together in a Line, through a Body of above a thousand
Savages, beating down all that came in their Way, got the Victory
over their Enemies, but to their great Sorrow, because it was with the
Loss of their Friend; whom, the other Party finding him alive, carry'd
off with some others, as I gave an Account in my former.
They describ'd most affectionately how they were surpris'd with
Joy at the Return of their Friend and Companion in Misery,
who they thought had been devour'd by wild Beasts of the worst
kind, (viz.) by wild Men; and yet how more and more they were
surpris'd with the Account he gave them of his Errand, and that
there was a Christian in any Place near, much more one
that was able, and had Humanity enough to contribute to theii
Deliverance.
They describ'd how they were astonish'd at the Sight of the Relief
I sent them, and at the Appearance of Loaves of Bread, Things they
had not seen since their coming to that miserable Place ; how often
they crossed it, and blessed it, as Bread sent from Heaven; and what
a reviving Cordial it was to their Spirits to taste it; as also of the
other Things I had sent for their Supply. And after all, they would
have told me something of the Joy they were in at the Sight of a
Boat and Pilots to carry them away to the Person and Place from
whence all these new Comforts came; but they told me it was impos-
sible to express it by Words, for their excessive Joy, naturally driving
them to unbecoming Extravagances, they had no way to describe
them but by telling me that they border'd upon Lunacy, having no
way to give Vent to their Passion suitable to the Sense that was upon
them; that in some it worked one Way, and in some another; and
that some of them, through a Surprise of Joy, would burst out into
Tears; others be stark mad, and others immediately faint This
Discourse extremely affected me, and called to my Mind Frida/s
Ecstasy, when he met his Father, and the poor People's Ecstasy,
when I took them up at Sea, after their Ship was on Fire; the
Mate of the Ship's Joy, when he found himself deliver^ in the
Place where he expected to perish; and my own Joy when after
»8 Years' Captivity, I found a good Ship ready to carry me to my own
Country. All these Things made me more sensible of the Relation
of those poor Men, and more affected with it
Having thus given a View of the State of Things as I found them,
I must relate the Heads of what I did for these People, and the
Condition in which I left them. It was their Opinion and mine too,
that they would be troubled no more with the Savages; or that if they
were, they would be able to cut them off, if they were twice as many
as before; so they had no Concern about that Then I enter'd into
a serious Discourse with the Spaniard, whom I call Governor, about
their Stay in the Island; for as I was not come to carry any of them
off, so it would not be just to carry off some, and leave others, who
perhaps would be unwilling to stay, if their Strength was diminished.
On the other hand, I told them I came to establish them there,
not to remove them; and then I let them know that I had brought
with me Relief of sundry Kinds for them; That I had been at a great
Charge to supply them with all Things necessary, as well for theit
Convenience, as their Defence; and that I had such and such parti-
cular Persons with me, as well to increase and recruit their Number,
as by the particular necessary Employments which they were bred to,
being Artificers, to assist them in those Things, in which, at present,
they were to seek.
They were all together when I talked thus to them; and before I
delivered to them the Stores I had brought, I asked them one by one,
If they had entirely forgot, and bury'd the first Animosities that had
been among them, and would shake Hands with one another, and
engage in a strict Friendship and Union of Interest, that so there
might be no more Misunderstandings or Jealousies.
Will Atkins, with abundance of Frankness and good Humour,
said, They had met with Afflictions enough to make them all sober,
and Enemies enough to make them all Friends; that for his Part, he
would live and die with them; and was so far from designing any-
thing against the Spaniards, that he owned they had done nothing
to him but what his own mad Humour made necessary, and what
he would have done, and perhaps much worse, in their Case; and
that he would ask them Pardon, if I desir'd it, for the foolish and
brutish Things he had done to them; and was very willing and de-
sirous of living in Terms of entire Friendship and Union with them;
and would do anything that lay in his Power to convince them of it;
and as for going to England, he cared not if he did not go thither
these twenty Years.
The Spaniards said, They had indeed at first disarm'd and ex-
cluded Will Atkins and his two Countrymen for their ill Conduct,
as they had let me know; and they appeal'd to me, for the Neces-
sity they were under to do so: But that Will Atkins had behav'd
himself so bravely in the great Fight they had with the Savages, and
on several Occasions since, and had showed himself so faithful to.
and concern'd for, the general Interest of them all, that they had for-
gotten all that was past, and thought he merited as much to be
trusted with Arms, and supply'd with Necessaries, as any of
them; and that they had testify'd their Satisfaction in him by
committing the Command to him, next to the Governor himself.
And as they had an entire Confidence in him and all his Countrymen,
so they acknowledg'd they had merited that Confidence by all the
Methods that honest Men could merit to be valued and trusted;
and they most heartily embrac'd the Occasion of giving me this
Assurance, that they would never have any Interest separate from one
another.
Upon these frank and open Declarations of Friendship, we ap-
pointed the next Day to dine all together; and indeed we made <
splendid Feast: I caused the Ship's Cook and his Mate to come
on Shore, and dress our Dinner; and the old Cook's Mate we had on
Shore, assisted. We brought on Shore six Pieces of good Beef, and
four Pieces of Pork out of the Ship's Provision, with our Punch-bowl,
*nd Materials to fill it; and in particular, I gave them ten Bottles of
French Claret, and ten Bottles of English Beer; Things that neither
the Spaniards, or the Englishmen had tasted for many Years, and
which, it may be supposed, they were exceedingly glad of.
The Spaniards added to our Feast five whole Kids, which the
Cooks roasted; and three of them were sent cover'd up close on
Board the Ship, to the Seamen, that they might feast on fresh Meat
from on Shore, as we did with their Salt Meat from on Board.
After this Feast, at which we were very innocently merry, I brought
out my Cargo of Goods, wherein, that there might be no Dispute
about dividing, I showed them that there was sufficient for them all;
and desir'd that they might all take an equal Quantity of the Goods that
were for wearing; that is to say, equal when made up; as first, I dis-
tributed Linen sufficient to make every one of them four Shirts; and
at the Spaniards' Request afterwards, made them up six; these were
exceeding comfortable to them, having been what, as I may say, they
had long since forgot the Use of, or what it was to wear them.
I allotted the thin English Stuffs, which I mention'd before, to
make every one a light Coat, like a Frock, which I judged fittest for
the Heat of the Season; cool and loose, and order'd, that whenever
they decayed, they should make more, as they thought fit: The like
for Pumps, Shoes, Stockings and Hats, Grc.
I cannot express what Pleasure, what Satisfaction, sat upon the
Countenances of all these poor Men, when they saw the Care I had
taken of them, and how well I had furnish'd them; they told me I
was a Father to them, and that having such a Correspondent as I
was, in so remote a Part of the World, it would make them forget that
mey were left in a desolate Place; and they all voluntarily engag'd
to me not to leave the Place without my Consent
Then I presented to them the People I had brought with me, par
ticularly the Tailor, the Smith, and the two Carpenters, all of them
most necessary People; but above all, my general Artificer, than
whom they could not name anything that was more useful to them.
And the Tailor, to show his Concern for them, went to work imme-
diately, and, with my Leave, made them every one a Shirt the first
Thing he did; and, which was still more, he taught the Women, not
only how to sew and stitch, and use the Needle, but made them
assist to make the Shirts for their Husbands and for all the rest
As to the Carpenters, I scarce need mention how useful they were,
for they took in pieces all my clumsy unhandy Things, and made
them clever convenient Tables, Stools, Bedsteads, Cupboards,
Lockers, Shelves, and everything they wanted of that Kind.
But to let them see how Nature made Artificers at first, I carried
the Carpenters to see Will Atkins's Basket-house, as I called it, and
they both owned they never saw an Instance of such natural Ingenuity
before; nor anything so regular, and so handily built, at least of its
Kind: And one of them, when he saw it, after musing a good while,
turning about to me, I am sure, says he, that Man has no need of us;
you need do nothing but give him Tools.
Then I brought them out all my Store of Tools, and gave every
Man a Digging-Spade, a Shovel, and a Rake, for we had no Harrows
or Ploughs; and to every separate Place a Pick-axe, a Crow, a broad
Axe, and a Saw; always appointing, that as often as any were broken,
or worn out, they should be supply'd without grudging, out of the
general Stores that I left behind.
Nails, Staples, Hinges, Hammers, Chisels, Knives, Scissors, and all
sorts of Tools, and Iron-work, they had without Tale, as they requir'd,
for no Man would care to take mose than they wanted, and he must be
a Fool that would waste or spoil them, on any Account whatever; and,
for the Use of the Smith, I left two Ton of unwrought Iron for a Supply.
My Magazine of Powder and Arms, which I brought them, was
such, even to I'rofusion, that they could not but rejoice at them, for
now they could march as I used to do, with a Musket upon each
Shoulder, if there was Occasion, and were able to fight a thousand
Savages, if they had but some little Advantages of Situation, which
also they could not miss of if they had Occasion.
I carry'd on Shore with me the young Man, whose Mother was
starved to Death, and the Maid also; she was a sober, well educated,
religious young Woman, and behaved so inoffensively that every one
g&ve her a good Word; she had indeed an unhappy Life with us,
there being no Woman in the Ship but herself; but she bore it with
Patience. After a while, seeing Things so well order'd and in so
fine a way of thriving upon my Island, and considering that they had
neither Business or Acquaintance in the East Indies, or Reason foi
taking so long a Voyage: I say, considering all this, both of them
came to me, and desir'd I would give them leave to remain on the
Island, and be enter'd among my Family, as they called it
I agreed to it readily, and they had a little Plot of Ground allotted
to them, where they had three Tents or Houses set up, surrounded with
a Basket-work, Palisado'd like Atkins's, adjoining to his Plantation:
Their Tents were contriv'd so, that they had each of them a Room
apart to lodge in, and a middle Tent like a great Storehouse to lay
all their Goods in, and to eat and drink in; and now the other two
Englishmen remov'd their Habitation to the same Place, and so the
Island was divided into three Colonies, and no more, viz. thp
Spaniards with old Friday, and the first Servants, at my old Habita-
tion under the Hill; which was, in a word, the capital City; and
where they had so enlarg'd and extended their Works, as well under
as on rhe outside of the Hill, that they lived, though perfectly con-
ceal'd, yet full at large. Never was there such a little City in a Wood,
and so hid, I believe, in any Part of the World; for I verily believe,
a thousand Men might have ranged the Island a Month, and if they
had not known there was such a Thing, and looked on purpose for it
they would not have found it; for the Trees stood so thick and so
close, and grew so fast matted into one another, that nothing but
cutting them down first could discover the Place; except the only
two narrow Entrances, where they went in and out, could be found,
which was not very easy; one of them was just down at the Watep
Edge of the Creek, and it was afterwards above two hundred Yards to
the Place ; and the other was up the Ladder at twice, as I have already
formerly describ'd it; and they had a large Wood thick planted, also,
on the Top of the Hill, which contain'd above an Acre, which grew
apace, and cover'd the Place from all Discovery there, with only one
narrow Place between two Trees, not easy to be discover'd, to enter
on that Side.
The other Colony was that of W. Atkins's, where there were four
Families of Englishmen, I mean those I had left there, with their
Wives and Children; three Savases th»» were Siaves; the Widow
E E
and Children of the Englishman that was killed; the young Man and
the Maid; and by the way, we made a Wife of her also, before we
went away: There were also the two Carpenters and the Tailor,
whom I brought with me for them; also the Smith, who was a very
necessary Man to them, especially as a Gunsmith, to take care of
their Arms; and my other Man, whom I called Jack of all Trades;
who was in himself as good, almost, as 20 Men, for he was not only
a very ingenious Fellow, but a very merry Fellow, and before I went
away, we married him to the honest Maid that came with the Youth
in the Ship, I mention'd before.
And now I speak of Marrying, it brings me naturally to say some-
thing of the French Ecclesiastic that I had brought with me out of
the Ship's Crew, whom I took up at Sea. It is true, this Man was a
Roman, and perhaps it may give Offence to some hereafter if I leave
anything extraordinary upon Record of a Man whom, before I
begin, I must (to set him out in just Colours), represent in Terms
very much to his Disadvantage, in the Account of Protestants; as
first, that he was a Papist; secondly, a popish Priest; and thirdly, a
French popish Priest
But Justice demands of me to give him a due Character; and I
must say he was a grave, sober, pious, and most religious Person;
exact in his Life, extensive in his Charity, and exemplar in almost
everything he did; what then can any one say against my being
very sensible of the Value of such a Man, notwithstanding his Pro-
fession? Though it may be my Opinion, perhaps, as well as the
Opinion of others who shall read this, that he was mistaken.
The first Hour that I began to converse with him, after he had
agreed to go with me to the East Indies, I found Reason to delight
exceedingly in his Conversation; and he first began with me abouf
Religion in the most obliging Manner imaginable.
Sir, says he, you have not only, under God (and at that he crossed
his Breast), saved my Life, but you have admitted me to go this Voy-
age in your Ship, and by your obliging Civility have taken me into
your Family, giving me an Opportunity of free Conversation. Now
Sir, says he, you see by my Habit what my Profession is, and I guess
by your Nation what yours is: I may think it is my Duty, and doubt-
less it is so, to use my utmost Endeavours, on all Occasions, to bring
all the Souls I can to the Knowledge of the Truth, and to embraco
the Catholic Doctrine; but as I am here under your Permission, and
In your Family, I am bound in Justice to your Kindness, as well as
in Decency and good Manners, to be under your Government; and
therefore I shall not, without your Leave, enter into any Debates on
the Point of Religion, in which we may not agree, farther than you
shall give me Leave.
I told him, his Carriage was so modest, that I could not but
acknowledge it; that it was true, we were such People as they called
Heretics; but that he was not the first Catholic that I had convers'd
with, without falling into any Inconveniencies, or carrying the Ques-
tions to any height in Debate: That he should not find himself the
worse used for being of a different Opinion from us, and if we did
not converse without any Dislike on either Side upon that Score, it
should be his Fault, not ours.
He reply'd, that he thought all our Conversation might be easily
separated from Disputes: That it was not his Business to cap
Principles with every Man he discours'd with; and that he rather
desir'd me to converse with him as a Gentleman, than as a Religieuse;
that if I would give him leave at any time to discourse upon reli-
gious Subjects, he would readily comply with it; and that then, he
did not doubt but I would allow him also to defend his own Opinions,
as well as he could; but that without my Leave he would not break
in upon me with any such thing.
He told me farther, that he would not cease to do all that became
him in his Office, as a Priest, as well as a private Christian, to pro-
cure the Good of the Ship, and the Safety of all that was in her; and
though perhaps we would not join with him, and he could not pray
with us, he hoped he might pray for us, which he would do upon all
Occasions. In this Manner we convers'd, and as he was of a most
obliging Gentleman-like Behaviour; so he was, if I may be allow'd to
say so, a Man of good Sense, and as I believe, of great Learning.
He gave me a most diverting Account of his Life, and of the many
extraordinary Events of it; of many Adventures which had befallen
him in the few Years that he had been abroad in the World, and
particularly this was very remarkable, (viz.) That in the Voyage he
was now engag'd, he had had the Misfortune to be five times shipped
and unshipp'd, and never to go to the Place whither any of the Ships,
he was in, were at first design'd: That his first Intent was to have
gone to Martinico, and that he went on board a Ship bound thither,
at St. Malo; but being forced into Lisbon by bad Weather, the Ship
received some Damage, by running aground in the Mouth of the
River Tagus, and was oblig'd to unload her Cargo there; that find-
ing a Portuguese Ship there bound to the Madeiras, and ready to sail,
and supposing he should easily meet with a Vessel there bound to
Martinko, he went on board, in order to sail to the Madeiras; but
the Master of the Portuguese Ship being but an indifferent Mariner,
had been out in his Reckoning, and they drove to Fayal; where, how-
ever, he happen'd to find a very good Market for his Cargo, which
was Corn, and therefore resolv'd not to go to the Madeiras, but to
load Salt at the Isle of May, and to go away to Newfoundland: He had
no Remedy in this Exigence, but to go with the Ship, and had a
pretty good Voyage as far as the Banks, so they call the Place where
they catch the Fish, where meeting with a French Ship, bound from
France to Quebec in the River of Canada, and from thence to Mar-
tinko, to carry Provisions, he thought he should have an Opportunity
to complete his first Design: But when he came to Quebec, the
Master of the Ship died, and the Ship proceeded no farther; so the
next Voyage he shipped himself for France, in the Ship that was
burnt, when we took them up at Sea, and then shipped with us foi
the East Indies, as I have already said: Thus he had been disap-
pointed in five Voyages, all, as I may call it, in one Voyage, besides
what I shall have Occasion to mention farther of the same Person.
But, I shall not make Digressions into other Men's Stories, which
have no Relation to my own. I return to what concerns our Affair
in the Island: He came to me one Morning, for he lodged among
us all the while we were upon the Island; and it happen'd to be
just when I was going to visit the Englishmen's Colony, at the
farthest Part of the Island, I say, he came to me and told me, with
a very grave Countenance, that he had for two or three Days desir'd
an Opportunity of some Discourse with me, which he hoped shoulrf
not be displeasing to me, because he thought it might in some
Measure correspond with my general Design, which was the Pros-
perity of my new Colony, and perhaps might put it, at least more
than he yet thought it was, in the Way of God's Blessing.
I looked a little surpris'd at the last Part of his Discourse, and
turning a little short, How Sir, said I, can it be said, that we are not in
the Way of God's Blessing, after such visible Assistances and wonderful
Deliverances, as we have seen here, and of whkh I have given you 4
large Account I
If you had pleased, Sir, said he, with a world of Modesty, and yet
with great Readiness, to have heard me, you would have found no
room to have been displeas'd, much less to think so hard of me, that
I should suggest, that you have not had wonderful Assistances
and Deliverances; and I hope, on your Behalf, that you are in the
Way of God's Blessing, and your Design is exceeding good, and
vill prosper: But, Sir, though it were more so, than is even possible
co you, yet there may be some among you that are not equally right
in their Actions: And you know, that in the Story of the Children of
Israel, one Achan in the Camp, remov'd God's Blessing from them,
and turned his Hand so against them, that six-and-thirty of them,
though not concern'd in the Crime, were the Object of Divine
Vengeance, and bore the Weight of that Punishment
I was sensibly touched with this Discourse, and told him, his In-
ference was so just, and the whole Design seemed so sincere, and was
really so religious in its own Nature, that I was very sorry I had in-
terrupted him, and begged him to go on; and in the mean Time,
because it seemed, that what we had both to say might take up some
Time, I told him, I was going to the Englishmen's Plantations, and
asked him to go with me, and we might discourse of it by the Way:
He told me, he would more willingly wait on me thither, because
there partly the Thing was acted, which he desir'd to speak to me
about, so we walked on; and I pressed him to be free and plain
with me, in what he had to say.
Why then, Sir, says he, be pleased to give me Leave to lay down
a few Propositions, as the Foundation of what I have to say, that we
may not differ in the general Principles, though we may be of some
differing Opinions in the Practice of Particulars. First, Sir, though
we differ in some of the doctrinal Articles of Religion; and it is very
unhappy that it is so, especially in the Case before us, as I shall show
afterwards: Yet there are some general Principles in which we
both agree, (viz.) first, That there is a God; and that this God
having given us some stated general Rules for our Service and
Obedience, we ought not willingly and knowingly to offend him;
either by neglecting to do what he has commanded, or by doing
what he has expressly forbidden: And let our different Re-
ligions be what they will, this general Principle is readily owned
by us all, That the Blessing of God does not ordinarily follow a
presumptuous sinning against his Command; and every good
Christian will be affectionately concern'd to prevent any that are
under his Care, living in a total Neglect of God and his Commands.
It is not your Men being Protestants, whatever my Opinion may be
of such, that discharges me from being concern'd for their Souls, and
from endeavouring, if it lies before me, that they should live in as
little Distance from and Enmity with their Maker, as possible, espe-
cially if you give me Leave to meddle so far in your Circuit
I could not yet imagine what he aimed at, and told him, I granted
all he had said, and thanked him, that he would so far concern him-
self for us; and begged he would explain the Particulars of what he
had observ'd, that, like Joshua, to take his own Parable, I might put
away the accursed Thing from us.
Why then, Sir, says he, I will take the Liberty you give me; and
there are three Things, which, if I am right, must stand in the Way
of God's Blessing upon your Endeavours here, and which 1 should
rejoice for your sake, and their own, to see remov'd. And, Sir, says
he, I promise myself, that you will fully agree with me in them all, as
soon as I name them; especially because I shall convince you, that
every one of them may, with great Ease, and very much to your Satis-
faction, be remedy'd.
He gave me no Leave to put in any more Civilities, but went on.
First, Sir, says he, you have here four Englishmen, who have
fetched Women from among the Savages, and have taken them as
their Wives, and have had many Children by them all, and yet are
not marry'd to them after any stated legal Manner, as the Laws of
God and Man require; and therefore are yet, in the Sense of both,
no less than Adulterers, and living in Adultery. To this, Sir, says he,
I know you will object, That there was no Clergyman or Priest of
any Kind, or of any Profession, to perform the Ceremony; nor any
Pen and Ink, or Paper, to write down a Contract of Marriage, and
have it signed between them. And I know also, Sir, what the
Spaniard Governor has told you; I mean of the Agreement that he
oblig'd them to make, when they took these Women (viz.) That
they should choose them out by Consent, and keep separately to
them; which, by the way, is nothing of a Marriage, no Agreement
with the Women, as Wives, but only an Agreement among them-
selves, to keep them from quarrelling.
But, Sir, the Essence of the Sacrament of Matrimony (so he called
it, being a Roman) consists not only in the mutual Consent of the
Parties to take one another, as Man and Wife, but in the formal and
legal Obligation, that there is in the Contract, to compel the Man and
Woman at all Times, to own and acknowledge each other, obliging
the Men to abstain from all other Women, to engage in no other
Contract while these subsist; and on all Occasions, as Ability allows,
to provide honestly for them and their Children, and to oblige the
Women to the same, or like Conditions, mutatis mutandis, on their Side.
Now, Sir, says he, these Men may, when they please, or when
Occasion presents, abandon these Women, disown their Children,
leave them to perish, and take other Women, and marry them whilst
these are living. And here he added, with some Warmth, How, Sir,
is God honour'd in this unlawful Liberty? And how shall a Blessing
succeed your Endeavours in this Place, however good in themselves,
and however sincere in your Design, while these Men, who at present
are your Subjects, under your absolute Government and Dominion,
are allow'd by you to live in open Adultery?
I confess, I was struck at the Thing itself, but much more with the
convincing Arguments he supported it with; for it was certainly true,
that though they had no Clergyman upon the Spot, yet a formal
Contract on both Sides, made before Witnesses, and confirm'd by
any Token, which they had all agreed to be bound by, though it had
been but breaking a Stick between them, engaging the Men to
own these Women for their Wives, upon all Occasions, and never to
abandon them or their Children, and the Women to the same with
their Husbands, had been an effectual lawful Marriage in the Sight
of God; and it was a great Neglect that it was not done.
But I thought to have gotten off with my young Priest, by telling
him, that all that Part was done when I was not here, and they had
lived so many Years with them now, that if it was an Adultery, it
was past Remedy, they could do nothing in it now.
Sir, says he, ashing your Pardon for such Freedom, you are right in
this, that it being done in your Absence, you could not be charged
with that Part of the Crime: But I beseech you, flatter not yourself,
that you are not therefore under an Obligation to do your utmost
now to put an End to it How can you think, but that, let the
Time past lie on whom it will, all the Guilt, for the future, will lie
entirely upon you? Because it is certainly in your Power now to put
an End to it, and in nobody's Power but yours.
I was so dull still that I did not take him right; but I imagin'd,
that by putting an End to it, he meant that I should part them, and
not suffer them to live together any longer; And I said to him, I
could not do that by any Means, for that it would put the whole
Island into Confusion: He seemed surpris'd, that I should so far
mistake him. No, Sir, says he, I do not mean, that you should now
separate them, but legally and effectually marry them now; and as,
Sir, my Way of marrying them may not be so easy to reconcile them
to, though it will be as effectual, even by your own Laws, so your
Way may be as well before God, and as valid among Men; I mean,
by a written Contract, signed by both Man and Woman, and by all
the Witnesses present, which all the Laws of Europe would decree to
be valid.
I was amaz'd to see so much true Piety, and so much Sincerity of
Keal, besides the unusual Impartiality in his Discourse, as to his own
Party or Church, and such true Warmth for the preserving People that
he had no Knowledge of, or Relation to; I say, for preserving them
from transgressing the Laws of God; the like of which I had indeed
not met with anywhere: but recollecting what he had said, of marrying
them by a written Contract, which I knew would stand too ; I return'd
it back upon him, and told him, I granted all that he had said to
be just, and on his Part very kind, that I would discourse with the
Men upon the Point now, when I came to them: And I knew no
Reason why they should scruple to let him marry them all, which I
knew well enough would be granted to be as authentic and valid in
England, as if they were married by one of our own Clergymen. What
was afterwards done in this matter, I shall speak of by itself.
I then pressed him to tell me what was the second Complaint which
he had to make, acknowledging, that I was very much his Debtoi
for the first, and thanked him heartly for it He told me, he would
use the same Freedom and Plainness in the second, and hoped I
would take it as well: And this was, that notwithstanding these
English Subjects of mine, as he called them, had lived with those
Women for almost seven Years, had taught them to speak English,
and even to read it; and that they were, as he perceiv'd, Women of
tolerable Understanding, and capable of Instruction; yet they had
not to this Hour taught them anything of the Christian Religion, no,
not so much as to know that there was a God, or a Worship, or in
what Manner God was to be served, or that their own Idolatry, and
worshipping they knew not who was false and absurd.
This, he saia, was an unaccountable Neglect, and what Cod would
certainly call them to Account for, and perhaps at last take the
Work out of their Hands. He spoke this very affectionately and
warmly. I am persuaded, says he, had those Men lived in the savage
Country, whence their Wives came, the Savages would have taken
more Pains to have brought them to be Idolaters, and to worship
the Devil, than any of these Men, so far as he could see, had taken
with them to teach them the Knowledge of the true God. Now, Sir,
taid he, though I do not acknowledge your Religion, or you mine,
yet we should be glad to see the Devil's Servants, and the Subjects of
his Kingdom, taught to know the general Principles of the Christian
Religion; that they might, at least, hear of God, and of a Redeemer,
and of the Resurrection, and of a future State, Things which we all
believe; they had at least been so much nearer coming into the
Bosom of the true Church, than they are now in the public Profession
of Idolatry and Devil-Worship.
I could hold no longer; I took him in my Arms, and embrac'd
him with an Excess of Passion: How far, said I to him, have I been
from understanding the most essential Part of a Christian (viz.) to
love the Interest of the Christian Church, and the good of other
Men's Souls. I scarce have known what belongs to being a Christian.
O, Sir, do not say so, reply'd he, this Thing is not your Fault: No,
says I, but why did I never lay it to Heart as well as you? 'Tis not
too late yet, said he, be not too forward to condemn yourself: But
what can be done now, said I, you see I am going away? Will you
give me Leave, said he, to talk with those poor Men about it? Yes,
with all my Heart, said I, and will oblige them to give heed to
what you say too: As to that, said he, we must leave them to the
Mercy of Christ; but it is our Business to assist them, encourage
them, and instruct them; and if you will give me Leave, and God
his Blessing, I do not doubt but the poor ignorant Souls shall be
brought home into the great Circle of Christianity, if not into the
particular Faith that we all embrace, and that even while you stay here;
Upon this, / said, I shall not only give you Leave, but give you a
thousand Thanks for it What follow'd on this Account, I shall
mention also again in its Place.
I now pressed him for the third Article, in which we were to blame.
Why really, says he, it is of the same Nature, and I will proceed,
asking your Leave, with the same Plainness as before; it is aboul
your poor Savages, who are, as I may say, your conquer'd Subjects. It
is a Maxim, Sir, that is or ought to be receiv'd among all Christians of
what Church or pretended Church soever, (viz.) The Christian Know-
ledge ought to be propagated by all ,possible Means, and on all possible
Occasions: It is on this Principle that our Church sends Missionaries
into Persia, India, and China, and that our Clergy, even of the
superior Sort, willingly engage in the most hazardous Voyages, and the
dangerous Residence among Murderers and Barbarians, to teach
them the Knowledge of the true God, and to bring them over to
embrace the Christian Faith. Now, Sir, you have such an Oppor-
tunity here, to have six or seven-and-thirty poor Savages brought
over from Idolatry to the Knowledge of God, their Maker and Re-
deemer, that I wonder how you can pass such an Occasion of doing
Good, which is really worth the Expence of a Man's whole Life.
I was now struck dumb indeed, and had not one Word to say. I
had here a Spirit of true Christian Zeal for God and Religion before
me, let his particular Principles be of what kind soever. As for me,
I had not so much as entertain'd a Thought of this in my Heart
before, and I believe should not have thought of it; for I looked
upon these Savages as Slaves, and People, whom, had we any Work
for them to do, we would have used as such, or would have been
glad to have transported them to any other Part of the World; for
our Business was to get rid of them, and we would all have been
satisfy'd, if they had been sent to any Country, so they had never
seen their own: But to the Case, I say, I was confounded at his
Discourse, and knew not what Answer to make him. He looked
earnestly at me, seeing me in some Disorder; Sir, says he, 1 shall
be very sorry, if what I have said gives you any Offence: No, no,
says I, I am offended with nobody but myself; but I am perfectly
confounded, not only to think that I should never take any Notice
of this before, but with reflecting what Notice I am able to take of
it now. You know, Sir, said I, what Circumstances I am in; I am
bound to the East Indies, in a Ship freighted by Merchants, and to
whom it would be an insufferable Piece of Injustice to detain their
Ship here, the Men lying all this while at Victuals and Wages upon
the Owners' Account It is true, I agreed to be allow'd twelve Days
here, and if I stay more, I must pay 3/. Sterling per Diem Demurrage,
nor can I stay upon Demurrage above eight Days more, and I haw
been here thirteen Days already, so that I am perfectly unable to
engage in this Work, unless I would suffer myself to be left behind
here again, in which Case, if this single Ship should miscarry in any
Part of her Voyage, I should be just in the same Condition that I
was left in here at first, and from which I have been so wonderfully
delivered.
He owned the Case was very hard upon me, as to my Voyage; but
laid it home upon my Conscience, whether the Blessing of saving
seven-and-thirty Souls, was not worth my venturing all I had in the
World for? I was not so sensible of that as he was. I return'd upon
him thus, Why, Sir, it is a valuable Thing, indeed, to be an Instru-
ment in God's Hand to convert seven-and-thirty Heathens to the
Knowledge of Christ, but as you are an Ecclesiastic, and are given
over to the Work, so that it seems so naturally to fall into the Way
of your Profession; how is it, that you do not rather offer yourself to
undertake it, than press me to it?
Upon this he faced about, just before me, as we walked along, and
putting me to a full Stop, made me a very low Bow; I most heartily
thank God and you, Sir, says he, for giving me so evident a Call to so
blessed a Work; and if you think yourself discharg'd from it, and
desire me to undertake it, I will most readily do it, and think it a
happy Reward for all the Hazards and Difficulties of such a broken
disappointed Voyage as I have met with, that I may be dropped at last
into so glorious a Work.
I discover'd a kind of Rapture in his Face while he spoke this to
me; "his Eyes sparkled like Fire, his Face glowed, and his Colour
came and went, as if he had been falling into Fits; in a Word, he
was fired with the Joy of being embark'd in such a Work. I paused
a considerable while before I could tell what to say to him, for I was
really surpris'd to find a Man of such Sincerity and Zeal, and carry'd
out in his Zeal beyond the ordinary Rate of Men, not of his Profes-
sion only, but even of any Profession whatsoever. But after I had
consider'd it awhile, I asked him seriously if he was in earnest, and
that he would venture on the single Consideration of an Attempt on
those poor People, to be locked up in an unplanted Island for, per-
haps, his Life, and at last might not know whether he should be able
to do them any Good, or not?
He turned short upon me, and asked me what I called a Venture?
Pray, Sir, said he, what do you think I consented to go in your Ship
to the East Indies for? May, said I, that I know not, unless it waJ
to preach to the Indians: Doubtless it was, said he; and do you
think, if I can convert these seven-and-thirty Men to the Faith of
Christ, it is not worth my time, though I should never be fetched ofl
the Island again? nay, is it not infinitely of more worth to save so
many Souls, than my Life is, or the Life of twenty more of the same
Profession? Yes, Sir, says he, I would give Christ and the blessed
Virgin Thanks all my Days, if I could be made the least happy In-
strument of saving the Souls of these poor Men, though I was never
to set my Foot off of this Island, or see my native Country any more.
But since you will honour me, says he, with putting me into this Work,
for which I will pray for you all the Days of my Life; I have one
humble Petition to you, said he, besides. What is that ? said I. Why,
says he, it is, that you will leave your Man Friday with me, to be my
Interpreter to them, and to assist me; for without some Help I
cannot speak to them, or they to me.
I was sensibly troubled at his requesting Friday, because I could
not think of parting with him, and that for many Reasons; he had
been the Companion of my Travels; he was not only faithful to me,
but sincerely affectionate to the last Degree, and I had resoh/d to do
something considerable for him, if he out-liv'd me, as it was probable
he would. Then I knew that, as I had bred Friday up to be a Pro-
testant, it would quite confound him to bring him to embrace another
Profession; and he would never, while his Eyes were open, believe
that his old Master was a Heretic and would be damn'd; and this
might in the End ruin the poor Fellow's Principles, and so turn him
to his first Idolatry.
However, a sudden Thought reliev'd me in this Strait, and it was
this; I told him, I could not say that I was willing to part with
Friday on any Account whatever, though a Work that to him was of
more Value than his Life, ought to be to me of much less Value than
the keeping or parting with a Servant; but on the other hand, I was
persuaded that Friday would by no Means consent to part with me,
and I could not force him to it without his Consent, without manifest
Injustice, because I had promised I would never put him away, and he
had promis'd and engag'd to nie that lie would never leave, me unless
I put him away.
He seemed very much concern'd at it, for he had no rational Access
to these poor People, seeing he did not understand one Word of their
Language, nor they one Word of his: To remove this Difficulty, I
told him, Friday's Father had learned Spanish, which I found he
also understood, and he should serve him for an Interpreter; so he
was much better satisfied, and nothing could persuade him, but he
would stay to endeavour to convert them; but Providence gave
another, and very happy, Turn to all this.
I come back now to the first Part of his Objections. When we
came to the Englishmen, I sent for them all together, and after some
Account given them of what I had done for them, viz. what necessary
Things I had provided for them, and how they were distributed, which
ttiey were very sensible of, and very thankful for; I began to
ialk to them of the scandalous Life they led, and gave them a full
Account of the Notice the Clergyman had already taken of it, and
arguing how unchristian and irreligious a Life it was. I first asked
them if they were married Men or Bachelors? They soon explain'd
their Condition to me, and showed me that two of them were Widow-
ers, and the other three were single Men or Bachelors. I asked them
with what Consciences they could take these Women and lie with
them, as they had done, call them their Wives, and have so many
Children by them, and not be marry'd lawfully to them.
They all gave me the Answer that I expected, viz. that there wa»
nobody to marry them; that they agreed before the Governor to keep
them as their Wives; and to keep them and own them as their Wives;
and they thought as Things stood with them, they were as legally married
as if they had been married by a Parson, and with all the Formalities in
the World.
I told them, that no doubt they were married in the Sight of God,
and were bound in Conscience to keep them as their Wives, but that
the Laws of Men being otherwise, they might pretend they were not
married, and so desert the poor Women and Children hereafter; and
>hat their Wives being poor desolate Women, friendless and money-
less, would have no way to help themselves. I therefore told them,
that unless I was assur'd of their honest Intent, I could do nothing
for them; but would take Care that what I did should be for the
Women and their Children without them, and that unless they
would give some Assurances that they would marry the Women, I
could not think it was convenient they should continue together as
Man and Wife, for that it was both scandalous to Men, and offensive to
God, who they could not think would bless them, if they went on thus.
All tnis went on as I expected, and they told me, especially Will
4tkins, who seemed now to speak for the rest, that they loved theli
Wives as well as if they had been bor n in their own Native Country,
and would not leave them upon any Account whatever; and they did
verily believe their Wives were as virtuous and as modest, and did, to
the utmost of their Skill, as much for them, and for their Children, as
any Women could possibly do, and they would not part with them on
any Account: And Will Atkins for his own particular added, if any
Man would take him away, and offer to carry him home to England,
and make him Captain of the best Man of War in the Navy, he would
not go with him, if he might not carry his Wife and Children with
him; and if there was a Clergyman in the Ship, he would be married
to her now with all his Heart
This was just as I would have it; the Priest was not with me at
that Moment, but was not far off: So to try him farther, I told him I
had a Clergyman with me, and if he was sincere, I would have him
married the next Morning, and bid him consider of it, and talk
with the rest; he said, as for himself, he need not consider of it at
all, for he was very ready to do it, and was glad I had a Minister with
me, and he believ'd they would be all willing also. I then told him
that my Friend the Minister was a Frenchman, and could not speak
English, but that I would act the Clerk between them: He never so
much as asked me whether he was Papist or Protestant, which was
indeed what I was afraid of: But, I say, they never inquir'd about it
So we parted, I went back to my Clergyman, and Will Atkins went
in to talk to his Companions. I desir'd the French Gentleman not to
say anything to them, till the Business was thorough ripe, and I told
him what Answer the Men had given me.
Before I went from their Quarter, they all came to me, and told
me, they had been considering what I had said, that they were very
glad to hear I had a Clergyman in my Company, and they were
very willing to give me the Satisfaction I desir'd, and to be formally
Married as soon as I pleased, for they were far from desiring to part
with their Wives, and that they meant nothing but what was very
honest when they chose them; so I appointed them to meet me the
next Morning, and that in the meantime they should let their Wives
know the meaning of the Marriage-Law; and that it was not only to
prevent any Scandal, but also to oblige them, that they should not
forsake them, whatever might happen.
The Women were easily made sensible of the Meaning of the
Thing, and were very well satisfied with it, as, indeed, they had
Reason to be; so they failed not to attend all together at my Apart-
ment the next Morning, where I brought out my Clergyman; and
though he had not on a Minister's Gown, after the Manner of England,
or the Habit of a Priest, after the Manner of France; yet having a
black Vest something like a Cassock, with a Sash round it, he did
not look very unlike a Minister; and as for his Language, I was his
Interpreter.
But the Seriousness of his Behaviour to them, and the Scruples he
made of marrying the Women, because they were not baptiz'd, and
profess'd Christians, gave them an exceeding Reverence for his
Person; and there was no need after that, to inquire whether he was
a Clergyman or no.
Indeed, I was afraid his Scruple would have been carry'd so far, as
that he would not have marry'd them at all; nay, notwithstanding all
I was able to say to him, he resisted me, though modestly, yet very
steadily, and at last refused absolutely to marry them, unless he had
first talked with the Men, and the Women too; and though at first I
was a little backward to it, yet at last I agreed to it with a good Will,
perceiving the Sincerity of his Design.
When he came to them, he let them know, that I had acquainted
him with their Circumstances, and with the present Design: That he
was very willing to perform that Part of his Function, and marry
them as I had desir'd; but that before he could do it, he must take
the Liberty to talk with them. He told them, That in the Sight of
all indifferent Men, and in the Sense of the Laws of Society, they
had lived all this while in an open Adultery; and that it was true,
that nothing but the Consenting to marry, or effectually separating
them from one another now, could put an End to it; but there was
a Difficulty in it too, with respect to the Laws of Christian Matri-
mony, which he was not fully satisfy'd about, viz. That of marrying
one that is a professed Christian, to a Savage, an Idolater, and a
Heathen, one that is not baptiz'd; and yet that he did not see that
there was Time left for it to endeavour to persuade the Women to be bap-
tiz'd, or to profess the Name of Christ, whom they had, he doubted,
heard nothing of, and without which they could not be baptiz'd.
He told them, He doubted they were but indifferent Christians
themselves; that they had but little Knowledge of God, or of his
Ways; and therefore he could not expect that they had said much
CD their Wives on that Head yet; but that unless they would promise
him to use their Endeavours with their Wives, to persuade them to
become Christians, and would as well as they could instruct them in
the Knowledge and Belief of God that made them, and to worship
Jesus Christ that redeem'd them, he could not marry them; for h«
would have no Hand in joining Christians with Savages; nor was it
consistent with the Principles of the Christian Religion; and wa>
indeed expressly forbidden in God's Law.
They heard all this very attentively, and I deliver'd it very faith-
fully to them, from his Mouth, as near his own Words as I could,
only sometimes adding something of my own to convince them how
just it was, and how I was of his Mind; and I always very faithfully
distinguish'd between what L said from myself, and what were the
Clergyman's Words. They told me, it was very true, what the Gen
tleman had said, that they were but very indifferent Christians them-
selves, and that they had never talked to their Wives about Religion.
Lord, Sir! says Will Atkins, How should we teach them Religion?
Why, we know nothing ourselves; and besides, Sir, said he, should
we go to talk to them of God, and. Jesus Christ, and Heaven and Hell,
'twould be to make them laugh at us, and ask us, What we believe
ourselves? And if we should tell them we believe all the Things
that we speak of to them, such as of good People going to Heaven,
and wicked People to the Devil, they would ask us, Where we intend
to go ourselves, that we believe all this, and are such wicked Fellows,
as we indeed are? Why, Sir, it is enough to give them a Surfeit of
Religion at first Hearing: Folks must have some Religion them-
selves, before they pretend to teach other People. Will Atkins,
said I to him, though I am afraid what you say has too much Truth
in it, yet can you not tell your Wife that she's in the wrong? That
there is a God and a Religion better than her own; that her Gods
are Idols, that they can neither hear nor speak; that there is a great
Being that made all Things, and that can destroy all that he had
made; that he rewards the Good, and punishes the Bad; and that
we are to be judged by him at last for all we do here: You are not
so ignorant, but even Nature itself will teach you that all this is true,
and I am satisfy'd you know it all to be true, and believe it yourself.
That's true, Sir, said Atkins; but with what Face can I say an)'
thing to my Wife of all this, when she will tell me immediately it
cannot be true?
Not tnie! said I. What do you mean by that? Why, Sir, said
he, She will tell de it cannot be true, that this God I shall tell her of
can be just, or can punish, or reward, since I am not punish'd, and
sent to the Devil, that have been such a wicked Creature as she
knows I have been, even to her, and to everybody else; and that I
should be suffer'd to live, that have been always acting so contrary
to what I must tell her is Good, and to what I ought to have done.
Why, truly, Atkins, said I, I am afraid thou speakest too much
Truth; and with that I let the Clergyman know what Atkins had
said, for he was impatient to know: 0I said the Priest, tell hin?
there is one Thing will make him the best Minister in the World to
his Wife, and that is, Repentance; for none teach Repentance like
true Penitents: he wants nothing but to repent, and then he will be
so much the better qualify'd to instruct his Wife: He will be then
able to tell her, that there is not only a God, and that he is the just
Rewarder of Good and Evil, but that he is a merciful Being, and with
infinite Goodness and Long-suffering forbears to punish those that
offend, waiting to be gracious, and willing not the Death of a Sinner,
but rather that he should return and live; that oftentimes suffers
kicked Men to go on a long Time, and even reserves Damnation to
the general Day of Retribution. That it is a clear Evidence of God,
and of a future State, that righteous Men receive not their Reward,
or wicked Men their Punishment, till they come into anothei
World; and this will lead him to teach his Wife the Doctrine of the
Resurrection, and of the last Judgment; let him but repent for him-
self, he will be an excellent Preacher of Repentance to his Wife.
I repeated all this to Atkins, who looked very serious all the while,
and who, we could easily perceive, was more than ordinarily affected
»'ith it: When being eager, and hardly suffering me to make an End,
/ know all this, Master, says he, and a great deal more; but I haven't
the Impudence to talk thus to my Wife, when God, and my own
Conscience knows, and my Wife will be an undeniable Evidence
against me, that I have lived, as if I had never heard of a God, or
future State, or anything about it; and to talk of my repenting,
ALAS! And with that he fetched a deep Sigh; and I could see, that
Tears stood in his Eyes : Tis past all that with me. Past it! ATKINS,
said I, What dost thou mean by that? I know well enough what I
mean, says he, / mean 'tis too late, and that is too true.
1 told my Clergyman Word for Word what he said. The poor
IK
zealous Priest (I must call him so; for, be his Opinion what it will,
he had certainly a most singular Affection for the Good of other Men's
Souls; and it would be hard to think he had not the like for his own)
I say, this zealous, affectionate Man, could not refrain Tears also : But,
recovering himself, he said to me, Ask him but one Question, Is he
easy that it is too late, or is he troubled, and wishes it were not so?
I put the Question fairly to Atkins, and he answered with a great deal
of Passion, How could any Man be easy in a Condition that certainly
must end in eternal Destruction? That he was far from easy, but
that, on the contrary, he believ'd it would one Time or other
ruin him.
What do you mean by that? said I. Why, he said he believ'd he
should, one Time or other, cut his Throat to put an End to the
Terror of it
The Clergyman shook his Head with a great Concern in his Face,
when I told him all this: But turning quick to me upon it, says he,
Tf that be his Case, you may assure him it is not too late; Christ
will give him Repentance: But pray, says he, explain this to him,
That as no Man is saved but by Christ and the Merit of his Passion,
procuring divine Mercy for him, how can it be too late for any Man
to receive Mercy? Does he think he is able to sin beyond the
Power or Reach of divine Mercy? Pray tell him, there may be a
time when provok'd Mercy will no longer strive, and when God may
refuse to hear, but that it is never too late for Men to ask Mercy; and
we that are Christ's Servants are commanded to preach Mercy at all
times, in the Name of Jesus Christ, to all those that sincerely repent;
so that it is never too late to repent
I told Atkins all this, and he heard me with great Earnestness; but
it seemed as if he turned off the Discourse to the rest; for he said to
me he would go and have some Talk with his Wife; so he went out
awhile, and we talked to the rest I perceiv'd they were all stupidly
ignorant as to Matters of Religion, much as I was when I went
rambling away from my Father; and yet that there were none of
them backward to hear what had been said; and all of them seriously
promis'd that they would talk with their Wives about it, and do their
Endeavour to persuade them to turn Christians.
The Clergyman smiled upon me, when I reported what Answer
they gave, but said nothing a good while; but, at last, shaking hij
Head, We that are Christ's Servants, says he, can go no further than
(0 exhort and instruct, and when Men comply, submit to the
Reproof, and promise what we ask 'tis all we can do; we are
bound to accept their good Words: But believe me, Sir, said he,
whatever you may have known of the Life of that Man you call
Will Atkins, I believe he is the only sincere Convert among them;
I take that Man to be a true Penitent; I wont despair of the rest;
but that Man is apparently struck with the Sense of his past Life;
aud I doubt not, but when he comes to talk Religion to his Wife, he
will talk himself effectually into it; for attempting to teach others, is
sometimes the best way of teaching ourselves. I knew a Man, who
having nothing but a summary Notion of Religion himself, and being
wicked and profligate to the last Degree in his Life, made a
thorough Reformation in himself, by labouring to convert a Jew.
If that poor Atkins begins but once to talk seriously of Jesus Christ
to his Wife, my Life for it, he talks himself into a thorough Convert,
makes himself a Penitent: And who knows what may follow?
Upon this Discourse however, and their promising, as above,
to endeavour to persuade their Wives to embrace Christianity, ha
marry'd the other three Couple; but Will Atkins and his Wife were
not yet come in. After this, my Clergyman, waiting awhile, was
curious to know where Atkins was gone; and, turning to me, says he,
I entreat you, Sir, let us walk out of your Labyrinth here, and look;
I dare say, we shall find this poor Man somewhere or other talking
seriously to his Wife, and teaching her already something of Religion.
I began to be of the same Mind; so we went out together, and I
carry'd him a Way which none knew but myself, and where the Trees
were so thick set, as that it was not easy to see through the Thicket
of Leaves, and far harder to see in, than to see out; when, coming to
the Edge of the Wood, I saw Atkins and his tawny Savage Wife
sitting under the Shade of a Bush, very eager in Discourse; I
stopped short till my Clergyman came up to me; and then having
showed him where they were, we stood and looked very steadily at
them a good while.
We observ'd him very earnest with her, pointing up to the Sun,
and to every Quarter of the Heavens, then down to the Earth, then
out to the Sea, then to himself, then to her, to the Woods, to the
Trees. Now, says my Clergyman, you see my Words are made good,
the Man preaches to her; mark him now, he is telling her, that our
pod has made hiw, and her, and the Heavens, the Earth- the Sea, the
Woods, the Trees, &*c. I believe he is, said I; immediately we
perceiv'd Will Atkins start up upon his Feet, fall down on hi?
Knees, and lift up both his Hands: We suppose he said something,
6ut we could not hear him, it was too far for that; he did not con-
tinue kneeling half a Minute, but comes and sits down again by his
Wife, and talks to her again. We perceiv'd then the Woman very
attentive, but whether she said anything or no we could not tell;
while the poor Fellow was upon his Knees, I could see the Tears
run plentifully down my Clergyman's Cheeks, and I could hardly
forbear myself; but it was a great Affliction to us both that we
were not near enough to hear anything that passed between them.
Well, however, we could come no nearer for fear of disturbing
them, so we resoh/d to see an End of this Piece of still Conversation,
and it spoke loud enough to us without the Help of Voice. He sat
down again, as I have said, close by her, and talked again earnestly
to her, and two or three times we could see him embrace her most
passionately; another time we saw him take out his Handkerchief
and wipe her Eyes, and then kiss her again with a kind of Transport
very unusual; and after several of these Things we see him, on a
sudden, jump up again and lend her his hand to help her up, when
immediately, leading her by the Hand a Step or two, they both
kneeled down together, and continu'd so about two Minutes.
My Friend could bear it no longer, but cries out aloud, St PAUL
St PAUL! behold he prayeth; I was afraid Atkins would hear him,
therefore I entreated him to withhold himself awhile, that we might
see an End of the Scene, which to me, I must confess, was the most
affecting, and yet the most agreeable that ever I saw in my Life:
Well, he strove with himself and contain'd himself for a while, but
was in such Raptures of Joy, to think that the poor Heathen Woman
was become a Christian, that he was not able to contain himself;
he wept several times, then throwing up his Hands and crossing his
Breast, said over several Things Ejaculatory and by way of giving
God Thanks for so miraculous a Testimony of the Success of our
Endeavours; some he spokr softly, and I could net well hear,
others audibly, some in La,i.. some in French; then two or three
times the Tears of Joy would ini'Tupt him, that he could not speak
ax all: But I begged that he would compose himself, and let us more
narrowly and fully observe what was before us, which he did for a
Time, and the Scene was not ended there yet; for after the Do^r
Man and his Wife were risen again from their Knees, we observ'd ht
stood talking still eagerly to her; and we observ'd by her Motion,
that she was greatly affected with what he said, by her frequent lifting
up her Hands, laying her Hand to her Breast, and such other
Postures, as usually express the greatest Seriousness and Attention.
This continu'd about half a Quarter of an Hour, and then they walk'd
away too; so that we could see no more of them in that Situation
I took this Interval to talk with my Clergyman: And first, I told
him, I was glad to see the Particulars we had both been Witnesses
to; that though I was hard enough of Belief in such Cases, yet that I
began to think it was all very sincere here, both in the Man and his
Wife, however ignorant they might both be; and I hoped such a
Beginning would have a yet more happy End; and who knows, said
I, but these two may in Time, by Instruction and Example, work
upon some of the others? Some of them! said he, turning quick
upon me, ay, upon all of them; depend upon it, if those two Savages,
for he has been but little better, as you relate it, should embrace
Jesus Christ, they will never leave till they work upon all the rest;
for true Religion is naturally communicative, and he that is once made
a Christian, will never leave a Pagan behind him, if he can help it
I owned it was a most Christian Principle to think so, and a Testi-
mony of a true Zeal, as well as a generous Heart in him: But, my
Friend, said I, will you give me Leave to start one Difficulty here?
I cannot tell how to object the least Thing against that affectionate
Concern, which you show for the turning the poor People from their
Paganism to the Christian Religion: But how does this comfort you,
while these People are in your Account out of the Pale of the Catho-
lic Church, without which you believe there is no Salvation; so that
you esteem these but Heretics, and for other Reasons as effectually
lost as the Pagans themselves.
To this he answer'd with abundance of Candour and Christian
Charity thus; Sir, I am a Catholic of the Roman Church, and a
Priest of the Order of St Benedict, and I embrace all the Principles
of the Roman Faith: But yet if you will believe me, and that I do not
speak in Compliment to you, or in respect to my Circumstances and your
Civilities; I say, nevertheless, I do not look upon you, who call
yourselves Reform'd, without some Charity: I dare not say, though 1
know it is our Opinion in general; I say, I dare not say that you
cannot he saved: I will by no means limit the Mercy of Christ so
far, as to think that he cannot receive you into the Bosom of his
Church in a Manner to us unperceivable, and which it is impossible
for us to know, and I hope you have the same Charity for us. I
pray daily for your being restored to Christ's Church, by whatsoever
Methods he, who is All-wise, is pleased to direct: In the meantime,
sure you will allow it to consist with me, as a Roman, to distinguish
far between a Protestant and a Pagan; between one that calls on
Jesus Christ, though in a Way which I do not think is according to
the true Faith, and a Savage, a Barbarian, that knows no God, no
Christ, no Redeemer; and if you are not within the Pale of the
Catholic Church, we hope you are nearer being restor'd to it than
those that know nothing of God or his Church: And I rejoice there-
fore when I see this poor Man, who you say has been a Profligate,
and almost a Murderer, kneel down and pray to Jesus Christ, as we
suppose he did, though not fully enlighten'd; believing that God,
from whom every such Work proceeds, will sensibly touch his Heart,
<uid bring him to the further Knowledge of that Truth in his own
Time; and if God shall influence this poor Man to convert and in-
struct the ignorant Savage his Wife, I can never believe that he
shall be cast away himself; and have I not Reason then to rejoice,
the nearer any are brought to the Knowledge of Christ, though they
may not be brought quite home into the Bosom of the Catholic
Church, just at the time when I may desire it? leaving it to the
Goodness of Christ to perfect his Work in his own time, and his
own way. Certainly I would rejoice if all the Savages in America
were brought like this poor Woman to pray to God, though they were
to be all Protestants at first, rather than they should continue Pagans
and Heathens; firmly believing, that he that had bestow'd the first
Light to them, would further illuminate them with a Beam of his
heavenly Grace, and bring them into the Pale of his Church when he
should see good.
I was astonish'd at the Sincerity and Temper of this truly pious
Papist, as much as I was oppress'd by the power of his Reasoning;
and it presently occurr'd to my Thoughts, that if such a Temper was
universal, we might be all Catholic Christians, whatever Church or
particular Profession we joined to, or joined in; that a Spirit of
Charity would soon work us all up into right Principles; and in a
Word, as he thought that the like Charity would make us all Catholics,
so I told him I believed, had all the Members of his Church the like
Moderation, they would soon be all Protestants. And there we left
that Part, for we never disputed at all.
However, I talked to him another Way, and taking him by the
Hand, My Friend, says I, I wish all the Clergy of the Roman Church
were blest with such Moderation, and had an equal Share of your
Charity. I am entirely of your Opinion; but I must tell you, that if
you should preach such Doctrine in Spain or Italy, they would put
you into the Inquisition.
It may be so, said he, I know not what they might do in Spain or
Italy, but I will not say they would be the better Christians for that
Severity, for I am sure there is no Heresy in too much Charity.
Well, as Will Atkins and his Wife were gone, our Business there
was over; so we went back our own Way; and when wf came back,
we found them waiting to be called in; observing this, I asked my
Clergyman if we should discover to him that we had seen him under
the Bush, or no; and it was his Opinion we should not; but that
we should talk to him first, and hear what he would say to us; so
we called him in alone, nobody being in the Place but ourselves; and
I began with him thus:
Will Atkins, said I, prithee what Education had you? What was
your Father?
W. A. A better Man than ever I shall be. Sir, my Father was
a Clergyman.
R. C. What Education did he give you?
W. A. He would have taught me well, Sir; but I despis'd all
Education, Instruction or Correction, like a Beast as I was.
R. C. It's true, Solomon says, He that despises Reproof is brutish.
W. A. Ay, Sir, I was brutish, indeed, I murder'd my Father; for
God's sake, Sir, talk no more about that, Sir; I murder'd my pooi
Father.
Pr. Ha! a Murderer !*
• Here the Priest started (for I interpreted every Word as he
spoke it) and looked pale. It seems he believ'd that Will had
really killed his own Father.
R. C. No, no, sir, I do not understand him so; Will Atkins^
explain yourself, you did not kill your Father, did you, with your
own Hands?
39°
ADVENTURES OF
W. A. No, Sir, I did not cut his Throat, but I cut the Thread of all
his Comforts, and shorten'd his Days; I broke his Heart by Ihe most
ungrateful, unnatural Return, for the most tender affectionate Treat-
ment that ever Father gave, or Child could receive.
R. C. Well, I did not ask you about your Father to extort this
Confession; I pray God give you Repentance for it, and forgive you
that, and all your other Sins; but I asked you, because I see, that
though you have not much Learning, yet you are not so ignorant as
some are in Things that are Good; that you have known more of
Religion a great deal than you have practised.
W. A. Though you, Sir, did not extort the Confession that I make
about my Father, Conscience does; and whenever we come to look
back upon our Lives, the Sins against our indulgent Parents are cer-
tainly the first that touch us; the Wounds they make lie the deepest,
and the Weight they leave will lie heaviest upon the Mind, of all the
Sins we can commit
R. C. You talk too feelingly and sensibly for me, Atkins; I
cannot bear it
W. A. You bear it, Master! I daresay you know nothing of it
R. C. Yes, Atkins, every Shore, every Hill, nay, I may say, every
Tree in this Island is witness to the Anguish of my Soul, for my In-
gratitude and base Usage of a good tender Father; a Father much
like yours, by your Description; and I murder'd my Father as well as
you, Will Atkins; but I think, for all that, my Repentance is short
of yours too* by a great deal
• / would have said more, if I could have restrain'd my
Passions; but I thought this poor Man's Repentance was so
much sincerer than mine, that I was going to leave off the
Discourse and retire, for I was surpriid with what he said;
and thought, that instead of my going about to teach and in-
struct him, the Man was made a Teacher and Instructor to
me, in a most surprising and unexpected Manner.
I laid all this before the young Clergyman, who was greatly
tffected with it, and said to me, Did I not say, Sir, that when this
Man was converted, he would preach to us all? I tell you,
Sir, if this one Man be made a true Penitent, here will be no
need of me; he will make Christians of all in the Island. But
having a little compos'd myself, I renew'd my Discourse with Will
Atkins.
But, WILL, said 7, How comes the Sense of this Matter to touch
you just now?
W. A. Sir, you have set me about a Work that has struck a Dart
through my very Soul; I have been talking about God and Religion
to my Wife, in order, as you directed me, to make a Christian of her,
and she has preached such a Sermon to me, as I shall never forget
while I live.
R. C. No, no, it is not your Wife has preached to you; but when
you were moving religious Arguments to her, Conscience has flung
them back upon you.
W. A. Ay, Sir, with such a Force as is not to be resisted.
R. C. Pray Will let us know what passed between you and your
Wife, for I know something of it already.
W. A. Sir, it is impossible to give you a full Account of it; I am
too full to hold it, and yet have no Tongue to express; but let her
have said what she will, and though I cannot give you an Account of
it, this I can tell you of it, that I resolve to amend and reform my
Life.
R. C. But tell us some of it How did you begin, Will? For
this has been an extraordinary Case, that's certain. She has preached
a Sermon, indeed, if she has wrought this upon you.
W. A. Why, I first told her the Nature of our Laws about Mar-
riage, and what the Reasons were, that Men and Women were
oblig'd to enter into such Compacts, as it was neither in the Power
of one or other to break; that otherwise, Order and Justice could
not be maintain'd, and Men would run from their Wives, and
abandon their Children, mix confusedly with one another, and
neither Families be kept entire, or Inheritances be settled by legal
Descent
R. C. You talk like a Civilian, Will; could you make her un-
derstand what you meant by Inheritance and Families? They know
no such Thing among the Savages, but marry anyhow, without Re-
gard to Relation, Consanguinity, or Family; Brother and Sister; nay,
as I have been told, even the Father and Daughter, and Son and th«
M other.
W. A. I believe, Sir, you are misinform'd, and my Wife assures me
of the contrary, and that they abhor it; perhaps, for any farther Rela-
tions they may not be so exact as we are. But she tells me they
never touch one another in the near Relations you speak of.
R. C. Well, what did she say to what you told her?
W. A. She said, she lik'd it very well, and it was much better
than in her Country.
R. C. But did you tell her what Marriage was?
W. A. Ay, ay, there began all our Dialogue. I asked her if she
would be marry'd to me our Way? She asked me what Way that was I
I told her Marriage was appointed by God; and here we had a
strange Talk together, indeed, as ever Man and Wife had I believe.
N.B. This Dialogue between W. Atkins and his Wife, as I took
it down in Writing, just after he told it me, was as follows.
Wife. Appointed by your God! Why, have you a God in your
Country?
W. A. Yes, my Dear, God is in every Country.
Wife. No, you God in my Country; my Country have the great
old Benamuckee God.
W. A. Child, I am very unfit to show you who God is; God is
in Heaven, and made the Heaven and the Earth, the Sea, and all
that in them is.
Wife. No makee de Earth; no, you God make all Earth, no make
my Country.*
* W. A. laughed a little at her Expression of God not making her
Country.
Wife. No laugh, why laugh me? This no Thing to Laugh.*
* He was justly reprov'd by his Wife, for she was more serious
than he at first.
W. A. That's true indeed, I will not laugh any more my Dear.
Wife. Why you say, you God make all?
W. A. Yes, Child, our God made the whole World, and you, and
I, and all Things; for he is the only true God, there is no God but
nim, he lives for ever in Heaven.
Wife Why you no tell me lonr ago'
W. A. That's true indeed, but I have been a wicked Wretch, and
have not only forgotten to acquaint thee with anything before, but
have lived without God in the World myself.
Wife. What have you de great God in you Country, you no
know him? No say O to him? No do good Thing for him? That
no possible!
W. A. It is too true; though for all that, we live as if there was no
God in Heaven, or that he had no Power on Earth.
Wife. But why, God let you do so? Why he no makee you good
live?
W. A. It is all our own Fault
Wife. But you say me, he is Great, much Great, have much great
Power; can makee kill, when he will; why he no makee kill when
you no serve him? No say O to him? No be good Mans?
W. A. That is true; he might strike me dead, and I ought to
expect it, for I have been a wicked Wretch, that is true; but God
is merciful, and does not deal with us as we deserve.
Wife. But then, do not you tell God Tankee for that too?
W. A. No, indeed, I have not thanked God for his Mercy, any
more than I have feared God for his Power.
Wife. Then you God no God; me no think, believe, he be such
one, great much Power, strong; no makee kill you though you
makee him much Angry.
W. A. What? Will my wicked Life hinder you from believing in
God! What a dreadful Creature r.m I; and what a sad Truth is
it, that the horrid Lives of Christians hinder the Conversions of
Heathens!
Wife. How me tink you have great much God • up there, and yet
no do well, no do good Thing? Can he tell? Sure he no tell what
you do?
* She points up to Heaven.
W. A. Yes, res, he knows and sees all Things; he hears us

speak.
Wife. What! he no hear you swear, curse, speak the great Damn
W. A. Yes, yes, he hears it all.
Wife. Where be then the muchee great Power strong?
W. A. He is merciful, that's all we can say for it; and this proves
him to be the true God; he is God and not Man; and therefore w»
are not consum'd.*
* Here Will Atkins told us he was struck with Horror, to think
how he could tell his Wife so clearly that God sees, and hearsx
and knows the secret Thoughts of the Heart, and all that we do;
and yet that he had dar'd to do all the vile Things he had done.
Wife. Merciful! what you call that?
W. A. He is our Father and Maker, and he pities and spares us.
Wife. So then he never makee kill, never angry when you do
wicked; then he no good himself, or no great able.
W. A. Yes, yes, my Dear, he is infinitely good, and infinitely great,
and able to punish too, and sometimes to show his Justice and
Vengeance, he lets fly his Anger to destroy Sinners, and make
Examples; many are cut off" in their Sins.
Wife. But no make kill you yet, then he tell you may be that he
no make you kill, so you make de Bargain with him, you do bad
Thing, he no be angry at you, when he be angry at other Mans.
W. A. No indeed, my Sins are all Presumptions upon his Good-
ness; and he would be infinitely just if he destroy'd me as he has
done other Men.
Wife. Well, and yet no kill, no makee you dead, what you say to
him for that, you no tell him Tankee for all that too?
W. A. I am an unthankful, ungrateful Dog, that's true.
Wife. Why? He no makee you much good better; you say he
makee you.
W. A. He made me as he made all the World; 'tis I have do
form'd myself, and abus'd his Goodness, and made myself an
abominable Wretch.
Wife. I wish you makee God know me; I no ::>.akee him angry, I
no do bad wicked Thing.
Here Will Atkins said his Heart sunk within him, to hear apoot
untaught Creature desire to be taught to know God, and he such
a wicked Wretch, that he could not say one Word to her about
God, but what the Reproach of his own Carriage would make
most irrational to her to believe; nay, that already she had told
him, that she could not believe in God, because he that was so
wicked was not destroy'd
>V. A. My Dear, you mean, you wish I could teach you to know
God, not God to know you; for he knows you already, and every
Thought in your Heart.
Wife. Why then he know what I say to you now? He know xaz
wish to know him; how shall me know who makee me?
W. A. Poor Creature, he must teach thee, I cannot teach thee;
I'll pray to him to teach thee to know him, and to forgive me that I
am unworthy to teach thee.
The poor Fellow was in such an Agony at her desiring him to
make her know God, and her wishing to know him, that, he
said, he fell down on his Knees before her, and prayed to God
to enlighten her Mind with the saving Knowledge of Jesus
Christ, and to pardon his Sins, and accept of his being the un-
worthy Instrument of instructing her in the Principles oj
Religion; after which he sat down by her again, and their
Dialogue went on. N.B. This was the Time when we saw
him kneel down, and lift up his Hands.
Wife. What you put down the Knee for? What you hold up the
Hand for? What you say? Who you speak to? What is all that?
W. A. My Dear, I bow my Knees in Token of my Submission to
him that made me; I said O to him, as you call it, and as you say
your old Men do to their Idol Benamuckee; that is, I prayed to him.
Wife. What you say 0 to him for?
W. A. I prayed to him to open your Eyes, and your Understand-
ing, that you may know him, and be accepted by him.
Wife. Can he do that too?
W. A. Yes, he can, he can do all Things.
Wife, But now he hear what you say?
W. A. Yes, he has bid us pray to him, and promis'd to hear us.
Wife. Bid you pray? When he bid you? How he bid you?
What! you hear him speak?
W. A. No; we do not hear him speak, but he has reveal'd him-
self many Ways to us.
Here he was at a great Loss to make her understand, that God hat
rrjeaTd himself to us by his Word, and what his Word was:
But at last he told it her thus. ..
W. A. God has spoken to some good Men in former Days, even
from Heaven, by plain Words; and God has inspir'd good Men by
his Spirit; and they have written all his Laws down in a Book.
Wife. Me no understand that; where is Book?
W. A. Alas, my poor Creature, I have not this Book; but I hope
I shall one Time or other get it for you, and help you to read it
Here he embrac'd her with great Affection; but with Inexpressible
Grief, that he had not a Bible.
Wife. But how you makee me know, that God teachee them to
write that Book?
W. A. By the same Rule that we know him to be God.
Wife. What Rule, what Way you know him?
W. A. Because he teaches and commands nothing but what is
good, righteous, and holy; and tends to make us perfectly good, as
well as perfectly happy; and because he forbids and commands us
to avoid all that is wicked, that is evil in itself, or evil in its
Consequences.
Wife. That me would understand, that me fain see; if he teachee
all good Thing, forbid all wicked Thing, he reward all good Thing,
punish all wicked Thing, he make all Thing, he give all Thing; he
hear me when I say O to him, as you go do just now; he makee me
good, if I wish be good; he spare me, no makee kill me, when I no
be good; all this you say he do, yet he be great God; me take,
think, believe him be great God; me say O to him too with you, my
Dear.
Here the poor Man could forbear no longer; but raising her up,
made her kneel by him, and he prayed to God aloud to instruct hex
in the Knowledge of himself by his Spirit, and that by some good
Providence, if possible, she might some time or other come to have a
Bible, that she might read the Word of God, and be taught by it to
know him.
This was the Time that we saw him lift her up by the hand, and
saw him kneel down by her, as above.
They had several other Discourses it seems after this, too long to
set down here; and particularly she made him promise, that since he
confess'd his own Life had been a wicked abominable Course or
Provocation against God, that he would reform it- and not »^ake God
angTy any more, lest he should make him dead, as she called it, and
then she should be left alone, and never be taught to know this God
better; and lest he should be miserable, as he had told her wicked
Men should be after Death.
This was a strange Account, and very affecting to us both, but
particularly to the young Clergyman; he was indeed wonderfully sur-
pris'd with it, but under the greatest Affliction imaginable, that he
could not talk to her, that he could not speak English to make her
understand him; and as she spoke but very broken English, he could
not understand her; However he turned himself to me, and told me,
that he believ'd there must be more to do with this Woman than to
marry her: I did not understand him at first, but at length he ex-
plain'd himself, (viz.) that she ought to be Baptiz'd.
I agreed with him in that Part readily, and was for going about it
presently: No, no, hold Sir, said he, though I would have her be Bap-
tiz'd by all Means, yet I must observe, that Will Atkins, her Husband,
has indeed brought her in a wonderful Manner to be willing to
embrace a religious Life, and has given her just Ideas of the Being
of a God, of his Power, Justice, Mercy; yet I desire to know of him,
if he had said anything to her of Jesus Christ, and of the Salvation of
Sinners, of the Nature of Faith in him, and Redemption by him, of
the Holy Spirit, the Resurrection, the last Judgment, and a future
State.
I called Will Atkins again, and asked him; but the poor Fellow
fell immediately into Tears, and told us he had said something to her
of all those things, but that he was himself so wicked a Creature, and
his own Conscience so reproach'd him with his horrid ungodly Life,
that he trembled at the Apprehensions, that her Knowledge of him
should lessen the Attention she should give to those Things, and
make her rather contemn Religion than receive it: But he was assur'd,
he said, that her Mind was so dispos'd to receive due Impressions of
all those Things, that if I would but discourse with her, she would
make it appear to my Satisfaction, that my Labour would not be lost
upon her.
Accordingly I called her in, and placing myself as Interpreter be
tween my religious Priest and the Woman, I entreated him to begin
with her; but sure such a Sermon was never preached by a Popish
Priest in these latter Ages of the World; and, as I told him, I thought
he had all the Zeal, all the Knowledge, all the Sincerity of a Chris-
tian, without the Error of a Roman Catholic; and that I took him to
he such a Clergyman, as the Roman Bishops were before the Church
of Rome assum'd spiritual Sovereignty over the Consciences of Men.
In a word, he brought the poor Woman to embrace the Know-
ledge of Christ, and of Redemption by him, not with Wonder and
Astonishment only, as she did the first Notions of a God, but with
Joy and Faith, with an Affection and a surprising Degree of Under-
standing, scarce to be imagin'd, much less to be express'd; and at
her own Request she was Baptiz'd.
When he was preparing to Baptize her, I entreated him that he
would perform that Office with some Caution, that the Man might
not perceive he was of the Roman Church, if possible, because of
other ill Consequences which might attend a Difference among us in
that very Religion, which we were instructing the other in: He told
me, that as he had no consecrated Chapel, no proper Things for the
Office, I should see he would do it in a Manner that I should not
know by it, that he was a Roman Catholic myself, if I had not known
it before: And so he did; for saying only some Words over to him-
self in Latin, which I could not understand, he poured a whole
Dishful of Water upon the Woman's Head, pronouncing in French,
very loud, MARY, which was the Name her Husband dcsir'd me to
give her; for I was her Godfather, I Baptize thee in the Name of the
Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost; so that none could
know anything by it, what Religion he was of: He gave the Bene-
diction afterwards in Latin; but either Will Atkins did not know but
it was in French, or else did not take Notice of it at that time.
As soon as this was over we married them; and after the Marriage
was over he turned himself to Will Atkins, and in a very affectionate
Manner exhorted him, not only to persevere in that good Disposition
he was in, but to support the Convictions that were upon him by a
Resolution to reform his Life; told him it was in vain to say he re-
pented, if he did not forsake his Crimes: Represented to him, how
God had honour'd him with being the Instrument of bringing his
Wife to the Knowledge of the Christian Religion, and that he should
be careful he did not dishonour the Grace of God, and that if he did,
he would see the Heathen a better Christian than himself, the Savage
converted, and the Instrument cast away.
He said a great many good Things to them both, and then recom-
mending them in a few Words to God's Goodness, gave them the
Benediction again, I repeating everything to them in English, and
thus ended the Ceremony. I think it was the most pleasant, agree-
able Day to me that ever I passed in my whole Life.
But my Clergyman had not done yet; his Thoughts hung con-
tinually upon the Conversion of the seven and thirty Savages, and
fain he would have stayed upon the island to have undertaken it; but
I convinc'd him, first, that his Undertaking was impracticable in
itself; and secondly, that perhaps 1" would put it into a Way of being
done in his Absence to his Satisfaction; of which, by and by.
Having thus brought the Affair of the Island to a narrow Compass,
I was preparing to go on board the Ship, when the young Man whom
I had taken out of the famish'd Ship's Company, came to me, and told
me, he understood I had a Clergyman with me, and that I had caused
the Englishmen to be married to the Savages, whom they called
Wives; that he had a Match too, which he desir'd might be finish'd
before I went, between two Christians, which he hoped would not be
disagreeable to me.
I knew this must be the young Woman who was his Mother's
Servant, for there was no other Christian Woman on the Island; so I
began to persuade him not to do anything of that Kind rashly, or
because he found himself in this solitary Circumstance : I represented
to him that he had some considerable Substance in the World, and
good Friends, as I understood by himself, and by his Maid also;
that the Maid was not only poor, and a Servant, but was unequal to
him, she being six or seven and twenty Years old, and he not above
seventeen or eighteen; that he might very probabiy, with my
Assistance, make a remove from this Wilderness, ana come into his
own Country again, and that then it would be a thousand to one but
he would repent his Choice; and the Dislike of that Circumstance
might be disadvantageous to both: I was going to say more, but hf
interrupted me, smiling, and told me, with a great deal of Modesty,
that I mistook in my Guesses, that he had nothing of that Kind in
his Thoughts, his present Circumstance being melancholy and dis-
consolate enough; and he was very glad to hear that I had Thoughts
of putting them in a Way to see their Country again, and nothing
should have put him upon staying there, but that the Voyage I was
going was so exceeding long and hazardous, and would carry mm
quite out of the Reach of all his Friends; that he had nothing 10
desire of me, but that I would settle him in some little Properry in
the Island where he was, give him a Servant or two and some few
Necessaries, and he would settle himself here like a Planter, waiting
the good Time, when, if ever I return'd to England, I would redeem
him, and hoped I would not be unmindful of him when I came into
England; that he would give me some Letters to his Friends in
London, to let them know how good I had been to him, and in what
Part of the World, and what Circumstance I had left him in; that
he promised me, that whenever I redeemed him, the Plantation, and
all the Improvement he had made upon it, let the Value be what it
would, should be wholly mine.
His Discourse was very prettily deliver'd, considering his Youth, and
was themore agreeable to me, because he told me positively the Match
was not for himself: I gave him all possible Assurances, that if I livec*
to come safe to England, I would deliver his Letters and do his Busi-
ness effectually, and that he might depend I would never forget the
Circumstance I had left him in; but still I was impatient to know
who was the Person to be married, upon which he told me it was
my Jack of all Trades, and his Maid Susan.
I was most agreeably surpris'd, when he named the Match, for
indeed I thought it very suitable; the Character of that Man I have
given already; and as for the Maid, she was a very honest, modest,
sober and religious young Woman, had a very good Share of Sense,
was agreeable enough in her Person, spoke very handsomely and to
the purpose, always with Decency and good Manners, and not back-
ward to speak when anything required it, or impertinently forward
to speak when it was not her Business; very handy and housewifely
in anything that was before her; an excellent Manager, and fit
indeed to have been Governess to the whole Island; she knew very
well how to behave to ail kind of Folks she had about her, and to
better, if she had found any there.
The Match being proposed in this Manner, we married them the
same Day, and as I was Father at the Altar, as I may say, and gave
her away, so I gave her a Portion; for I appointed her and her
Husband a handsome large Space of Ground for their Plantation;
and indeed this Match and the Proposal the young Gentleman made
to give him a small Property in the Island, put me upon par-
celling it out amongst them, that they might not quarrel afterwards
ibout their Situation.
This Sharing out the Land to them I left to Will Atkins, who
indeed was now grown a most sober, grave, managing Fellow, per-
fectly reform'd, exceeding Pious and Religious, and as far as I may be
allow'd to speak positively in such a Case, I verily believe, was a true
sincere Penitent
He divided Things so justly, and so much to every one's Satisfac-
tion, that they only desired one general Writing under my Hand for
the whole, which I caused to be drawn up and signed and sealed to
them, setting out the Bounds and Situation of every Man's Planta-
tion, and testifying that I gave them thereby severally a Right to the
whole Possession and Inheritance of the respective Plantations or
Farms, with their Improvements to them and their Heirs, reserving
all the rest of the Island as my own Property, and a certain Rent for
every particular Plantation after eleven Years, if I, or any one from
me, or in my Name, came to demand it, producing an attested Copy
of the same Writing.
As to the Government and Laws among them, I told them I was
not capable of giving them better Rules, than they were able to give
themselves, only made them promise me to live in Love and good
Neighbourhood with one another; and so I prepared to leave them.
One Thing I must not omit, and this is, that being now settled in a
Kind of Commonwealth among themselves, and having much Business
in Hand, it was but odd to have seven and thirty Indians live in a
Nook of the Island, independent, and indeed unemployed; for ex-
cepting the providing themselves Food, which they had Difficulty
enough in too, sometimes, they had no manner of Business or Pro-
perty to manage; I propos'd therefore to the Governor Spaniard,
that he should go to them with Friday's Father, and propose to them
to remove, and either plant for themselves, or take them into their
several Families as Servants to be maintain'd for their Labour, but
without being absolute Slaves, for I would not admit them to make
them Slaves by Force by any Means, because they had their Liberty
given them by Capitulation, and as it were Articles of Surrender,
which they ought not to break.
They most willingly embrac'd the Proposal, and came all very
cheerfully along with him; so we allotted them Land, and Planta-
tions, which three or four accepted of, but all the rest chose to be
employ'd as Servants in the several Families we had settled; and
thus my Colony was in a Manner settled as follows: The Spaniards
possess'd my original Habitation, which was the Capital City, and
extended their Plantations all along the side of the Brook, which
made the Creek that I have so often describ'd, as far as my Bower;
and as they increas'd their Culture, it went always Eastward; the
English lived in the North-East Part, where W. Atkins, and his
Comrades began, and came on Southward, and South-West, towards
the back Part of the Spaniards, and every Plantation had a great
Addition of Land to take in, if they found Occasion, so that they
need not jostle one another for want of Room.
All the East End of the Island was left uninhabited, that if any
of the Savages should come on Shore there, only for their usual cus-
tomary Barbarities, they might come and go, if they disturb'd no-
body, nobody would disturb them; and no doubt but they were often
ashore, and went away again, for I never heard that the Planters were
ever attack'd or disturb'd any more.
It now came into my Thoughts, that I had hinted to my Friend
the Clergyman, that the Work of converting the Savages might
perhaps be set on Foot in his Absence, to his Satisfaction; and I told
him that now I thought it was put in a fair Way; for the Savages
being thus divided among the Christians, if they would but every one
of them do their part with those which came under their Hands, I
hoped it might have a very good Effect
He agreed presently in that, if, said he, they will do their Part;
out how, says he, shall we obtain that of them? I told him, we
would call them all together, and leave it in Charge with them, or go
to them one by one, which he thought best; so we divided it; he to
speak to the Spaniards, who were all Papists, and I to the English,
who were all Protestants; and we recommended it earnestly to them,
and made them promise, that they never would make any Distinction
of Papist or Protestant, in their exhorting the Savages to turn
Christians; but teach them the general Knowledge of the true God,
and of their Saviour Jesus Christ; and they likewise promis'd us, that
they would never have any Differences or Disputes one with another
about Religion.
When I came to W. Atkins's House, I may call it so, for such a
House, or such a piece of Basket-Work, I believe, was not standing
in the World again; I say, when I came there, I found the young
Woman I have mention'd above, and Will Atkins's Wife, were
become Intimates; and this prudent religious young Woman had per-
fected the Work Will Atkins had begun; and though it was not
above four Days after what I have related, yet the new baptiz'd
Savage Woman was made such a Christian, as I have seldom heard
of any like her in all my Observation, or Conversation, in the World,
It came next into my Mind in the Morning before I went to them,
that amongst all the needful Things I had to leave with them, I had
not left them a Bible, in which I showed myself less considering for
them, than my good Friend the Widow was for me, when she sent me
the Cargo of an hundred Pounds from Lisbon, where she packed up
three Bibles and a Prayer-book: However, the good Woman's
Charity had a greater Extent than ever she imagin'd; for they were
reserv'd for the Comfort and Instruction of those, that made much
better Use of them than I had done.
I took one of the Bibles in my Pocket, and when I came to Will
Atkins's Tent or House, and found the young Woman, and Atkins's
baptiz'd Wife, had been discoursing of Religion together; for Will
Atkins told it me, with a great deal of Joy: I asked if they were
together now, and he said, yes; so I went into the House, and he,
with me, and we found them together very earnest in Discourse; O
Sir, says Will Atkins, when God has Sinners to reconcile to himself,
and Aliens to bring Home, he never wants a Messenger; my Wife
has got a new Instructor; I knew I was unworthy, as I was unca-
pable of that Work; That young Woman has been.sent hither from
Heaven; she is enough to convert a whole Island of Savages; the
young Woman blushed, and rose up to go away, but I desir'd her to
sit still; I told her, she had a good Work upon her Hands, and I
hoped God would bless her in it
We talked a little, and I did not perceive thev had any Book
among them, though I did not ask; but I put my Hand in my
Pocket, and pulled out my Bible; here, says I, to Atkins, I have
brought you an Assistant that perhaps you had not before; the
Man was so confounded, that he was not able to speak for some Time;
but recovering himself, he takes it with both his Hands, and turning
to his Wife, here, my Dear, says he; did not I tell you, our God,
though he lives above, could hear what we said? Here's the Book I
prayed for, when you and I kneeled down under the Bush; now God
has heard us, and sent it; when he had said so, the Man fell into
such Transports of a passionate Joy, that between the Joy of having
it, and giving God Thanks for it, the Tears run down his Face like a
Child that was crying.
The Woman was surprised, and was like to have run into a Mistake
that none of us were aware of; for she firmly believ'd God had sent
the Book upon her Husband's Petition; It is true, that providentially
it was so, and might be taken so in a consequent Sense; but I
believ'd, it would have been no difficult Matter at that Time, to have
persuaded the poor Woman to have believ'd that an express Mes-
senger came from Heaven, on Purpose to bring that individual Book;
but it was too serious a matter, to suffer any Delusion to take Place;
so I turned to the young Woman and told her we did not desire to
impose upon the new Convert, in her first, and more ignorant Under-
standing of Things; and begged her to explain to her that God may
be very properly said to answer our Petitions, when in the Course of
his Providence, such Things are in a particular Manner brought to
pass, as we petition'd for; but we do not expect Returns from
Heaven, in a miraculous and particular Manner, and that it is our
Mercy that it is not so.
This the young Woman did afterwards effectually; so that there
was I assure you, no Priestcraft used here; and I should have
thought it one of the most unjustifiable Frauds in the World, to have
had it so; but the Surprize of Joy upon Will Atkins, is really not to
be expressed; and there we may be sure, there was no Delusion:
Sure, no Man was ever more thankful in the World for anything of
its Kind, than he was for this Bible; nor I believe, never any Man
was glad of a Bible from a better Principle: and though he had been
a most profligate Creature, desperate, headstrong, outrageous, furious,
and wicked to a great Degree; yet this Man is a standing Rule to us
»11, for the well instructing Children, (viz.) that Parents should never
give over to teach and instruct, or ever despair of the Success of
their Endeavours, let the Children be ever so obstinate, refractory, or
to Appearance, insensible of Instruction; for if ever God in his Pro-
vidence, touches the Consciences of such, the Force of their Educa-
tion returns upon them, and the early Instruction of Parents is not
lost; though it may have been many Years laid asleep; but some
Time or other, they may find the Benefit of it
Thus it was with this poor Man; However ignorant he was, or
divested of Religion and Christian Knowledge: He found he had
some to do with now, more ignorant than himself; and that the least
Part of the Instruction of his good Father that could now come to
his Mind, was of Use to him.
Among the rest it occurr'd to him, he said, how his Father used
to insist much upon the inexpressible Value of the Bible; the Privilege
and Blessing of it to Nations, Families, and Persons; but he never
entertain'd the least Notion of the Worth of it, till now; when being
to talk to Heathens, Savages, and Barbarians, he wanted the Help of
the written Oracle for his Assistance.
The young Woman was very glad of it also for the present Occa-
sion, though she had one, and so had the Youth on board our Ship
among their Goods, which were not yet brought on Shore; and now
having said so many Things of this young Woman, I cannot omit
telling one Story more of her, and myself, which has something in it
very informing and remarkable.
I have related, to what Extremity the poor young Woman was re-
duced; how her Mistress was starved to Death, and did die on board
that unhappy Ship we met at Sea; and how the whole Ship's Com-
pany being reduc'd to the last Extremity; the Gentlewoman, and her
Son, and this Maid, were first hardly used as to Provisions; and at
last totally neglected and starv'd; that is to say, brought to the last
Extremity of Hunger.
One Day being discoursing with her upon the Extremities
they suffer'd, I asked her if she could describe by what she
had felt, what it was to starve, and how it appear'd; she told
me, she believ'd she could; and she told her Tale very distinctly
thus:
"First, Sir, said she, we had for some Days fared exceeding hard,
"and suffer'd very great Hunger; but now at last, we were wholly
"without Food of any Kind, except Sugar, and a little Wine, and a
"little Water. The first Day, after I had receiv'd no Food at all, I
"found myself towards Evening, first empty and sickish at my Stomach,
"and nearer Night mightily inclin'd to yawning and sleepy; I laid
"down on a Couch in the great Cabin to sleep, and slept about three
"Hours, and awak'd a little refresh'd; having taken a Glass of Wine
"when I lay down; after being about three Hours awake, it being
"about five o'Clock in the Morning, I found myself empty and my
"Stomach sickish, and laid down again, but could not sleep at all,
"being very faint, and ill; and thus I continu'd all the second Day,
"with a strange Variety, first hungry, then sick again, with retchings
"to Vomit; the second Night hieing oblig'd to go to Bed again,
"without any Food, more than a Draught of fair Water; and being
"asleep, I dream'd I was at Barbadoes, and that the Market wa»
"mightily stocked with Provisions; that I bought some for my
* Mistress, and went and dined very heartily.
"I thought my Stomach was as full after this as any would havo
"been after, or at a good Dinner; but when I waked, I was exceed-
"ingly sunk in my Spirits, to find myself in the Extremity of Famine:
"The last Glass of Wine we had, I drank, and put Sugar in it, be-
"cause, of its having some Spirit to supply Nourishment; but there
"being no Substance in the Stomach for the digesting Office to work
"upon, I found the only Effect of the Wine was, to raise disagreeable
'' Fumes from the Stomach, into the Head; and I lay, as they told
"me, stupid, and senseless, as one drunk for some Time.
"The third Day in the Morning, after a Night of strange and con-
"fus'd inconsistent Dreams ; and rather dozing than sleeping, I waked,
"ravenous and furious with Hunger; and I question, had not my
"Understanding return'd and conquer'd it—I say, I question whether
"if I had been a Mother, and had had a little Child with me, its Life
"would have been safe or not
"This lasted about three Hours; during which Time I was twice
"raging mad as any Creature in Bedlam, as my young Master told me,
"and as he can now inform you.
"In one of these Fits of Lunacy or Distraction, whether by the
"Motion of the Ship, or some Slip of my Foot, I know not; I fell
"down, and struck my Face against the Corner of a Pallet Bed in
"which my Mistress lay; and with the Blow the Blood gush'd out of
"my Nose; and the Cabin Boy bringing me a little Bason, I sat
"down and bled into it a great deal; and as the Blood run from me,
"I came to myself; and the Violence of the Flame or the Fever, I
"was in, abated, and so did the ravenous Part of the Hunger.
"Then I gTew sick, and retched to vomit, but could not; for I had
"nothing in my Stomach to bring up: After I had bled some Time,
u I swooned, and they all believ'd I was dead; but I came to myself
"soon after, and then had a most dreadful Pain in my Stomach, not
"to be describ'd; not like the Colic, but a gnawing eager Pain fot
"Food; and towards Night it went off with a kind of earnest Wish-
"ing or Longing for Food; something like, as I suppose, the Longing
"of a Woman with Child. I took another Draught of Water with
"Sugar in it, but my Stomach loathed the Sugar, and brought it all up
"again; then I took a Draught of Water without Sugar, and that
"stayed with me; and I laid me down upon the Bed, praying mosl
"heartily, that it would please God to take me away; and composing
"my Mind in Hopes of it, I slumber'd a while, and then waking,
"thought myself dying, being light with Vapours from an empty
"Stomach; I recommended my Soul then to God, and earnestly
"wished that somebody would throw me into the Sea.
"All this while my Mistress lay by me just as I thought expiring,
"but bore it with much more Patience than I, and gave the last Bit
"of Bread she had left to her Child, my young Master, who would
"not have taken it, but she oblig'd him to eat it; and I believe it
"saved his Life.
"Towards the Morning I slept again, and first when I awak'd, I
"fell into a violent Passion of Crying, and after that had a second Fit
"of violent Hunger; I got up ravenous, and in a most dreadful Con-
"dition; had my Mistress been dead, as much as I loved her, I am
"certain, I should have eaten a Piece of her Flesh, with as much Re-
"lish, and as unconcern'd, as ever I did the Flesh of any Creature
"appointed for Food; and once or twice I was going to bite my own
"Arm: At last, I saw the Bason in which was the Blood I had bled
"at my Nose the Day before; I ran to it, and swallow'd it with such
"Haste, and such a greedy Appetite, as if I had wonder'd nobody
"had taken it before, and afraid it should be taken from me now.
"Though after it was down, the Thoughts of it filled me with Horror,
"yet it checked the Fit of Hunger, and I drank a Draught of fair
"Water, and was compos'd and refresh'd for some Hours after it:
"This was the 4th Day, and thus I held it, till towards Night, when
"within the Compass of three Hours, I had all these several Circum-
"stances over again, one after another, (viz.) sick, sleepy, eagerly
"hungry, Pain in the Stomach, then ravenous again, then sick again,
"then lunatic, then crying, then ravenous again; and so every
"quarter of an Hour, and my Strength wasted exceedingly: At
"Night I laid me down, having no Comfort, but in the Hope that I
"should die before Morning.
"All this Night I had no Sleep; but the Hunger was now
"turned into a Disease; and I had a terrible Colic and Griping, by
"Wind instead of Food, having found its Way into the Bowels; and
"in this Condition I lay till Morning, when I was surpriz'd a tittle
"with the Cries and Lamentations of my young Master, who called
"out to me that his Mother was dead 3 I lifted myself up a little; for
"I had not Strength to rise, but found she was not dead, though she
"was able to give very little Signs of life.
"I had then such Convulsions in my Stomach, for want of some
"sustenance, that I cannot describe; with such frequent Throws and
"Pangs of Appetite, that nothing but the Tortures of Death can
"imitate; and in this condition I was when I heard the Seamen
"above cry out a Sail, a Sail, and halloo and jump about, as if they
"were distracted.
"I was not able to get off from the Bed, and my Mistress much
"less; and my young Master was so sick, that I thought he had been
"expiring; so we could not open the Cabin Door, or get any Account
"what it was that occasion'd such a Combustion, nor had we had
"any Conversation with the Ship's Company for two Days; they
"having told us, that they had not a Mouthful of anything to eat in the
"Ship; and they told us afterwards, they thought we had been dead.
"It was this dreadful Condition we were in when you were sent to
"save our Lives; and how you found us, Sir, you know as well as I,
"and better too."
This was her own Relation, and in such a distinct Account of
Starving to Death, as I confess, I never met with, and was exceeding
entertaining to me; I am the rather apt to believe it to be a true
Account, because the Youth gave me an Account of a good Part of
it; though I must own, not so distinct and so feelingly as his Maid;
and the rather, because it seems his Mother fed him at the Price of
her own Life: But the poor Maid, though her Constitution being
stronger than that of her Mistress, who was in Years, and a weakly
Woman too, she might struggle harder with it; I say, the poor Maid
might be supposed to feel the Extremity something sooner than her
Mistress, who might be allowed to keep the last Bit something longer
than she parted with any to relieve the Maid. No Question, as the
Case is here related, if our Ship, or some other, had not so provi-
dentially met them, a few Days more would have ended all their
Lives, unless they had prevented it by eating one another; and even
that as their Case stood would have served them but a little while,
they being 500 Leagues from any Land, or any Possibility of Relief,
other than in the miraculous Manner it happen'd: But this is by the
Way; I return to my Disposition of Things among the People.
And, First, It is to be observ'd here, That for many Reasons I did
not think fit to let them know anything of the Sloop I had framed
and which I thought of setting up among them; for I found, at least
at my first coming, such Seeds of Divisions among them, that I saw it
plainly had I set up the Sloop, and left it among them, they would
upon every light Disgust have separated, and gone away from one
another, or perhaps have turned Pirates, and so made the Island a
Den of Thieves, instead of a Plantation of sober and religious People
so as I intended it; nor did I leave the two Pieces of Brass Cannon
that I had on Board, or the two Quarter-Deck Guns, that my Nephew
took extraordinarily for the same Reason: I thought it was enough
to qualify them for a defensive War against any that should invade
them; but not to set them up for an offensive War, or to encourage
them to go Abroad to attack others, which in the End would only
bring Ruin and Destruction upon themselves and all their Under-
taking: I reserved the Sloop therefore, and the Guns, for theii
Service anc'Aer Way, as I shall observe in its Place.
I have flow done with the Island: I left them all in good Circum-
stances, and in a flourishing Condition, and went on board my Ship
again the 5th of May, having been five-and-twenty Days among
them; and as they were all resoh/d to stay upon the Island till I
came to remove them, I promis'd to send some further Relief from
the Brasils, if I could possibly find an Opportunity; and particu-
larly I promis'd to send them some Cattle, such as Sheep, Hogs, and
Cows: For as to the two Cows and Calves which I brought from
England, we had been oblig'd by the Length of our Voyage to kill
them at Sea, for want of Hay to feed them.
The next Day, giving them a Salute of five Guns at parting, we set
sail, and arriv'd at the Bay of All-Saints in the Brasils in about 23
Days, meeting nothing remarkable in our Passage, but this, That
about three Days after we sailed, being becalm'd, and the Current
setting strong to the E.N.E., running, as it were, into a Bay or Gulf
on the Land Side, we were driven something out of our Course, and
once or twice our Men cried Land to the Eastward; but whether it
was the Continent or Islands, we could not tell by any Means.
But the third Day towards Evening, the Sea smooth, and the
Weather calm, we saw the Sea, as it were, cover'd towards the Land
with something very black, not being able to discover what it was,
till after some Time, our chief Mate going up the main Shrouds a
little Way, and looking at them with a Perspective, cried out it was
an Army. I could not imagine what he meant by an Army, and
spoke a little hastily, calling the Fellow a Fool, or some <rtich Word:
Nay, Sir, says he, don't be angry, for 'tis an Army and a Fleet too;
for I believe there are a thousand Canoes, and you may see them
paddle along, and they are coming towards us too, apace.
I was a little suqms'd then indeed, and so was my Nephew, the
Captain; for he had heard such terrible Stories of them in the Island,
and having never been in those Seas before, that he could not tell
what to think of it, but said two or three Times, we should all be
devour'd. I must confess considering we were becalm'd, and the
Current set strong towards the Shore, I liked it the worse: However,
I bad him not be afraid, but bring the Ship to an Anchor, as soon as
we came so near to know that we must engage them.
The Weather continu'd calm, and they came on apace towards us;
30 I gave Order to come to an Anchor, and furl all our Sails: As for
the Savages, I told them they had nothing to fear but Fire; and
therefore they should get their Boats out, and fasten them, one close
by the Head, and the other by the Stern, and man them both well,
and wait the Issue in that Posture: This I did, that the Men in the
Boats might be ready with Skeets and Buckets to put out any Fire
these Savages might endeavour to fix to the Outside of the Ship.
In this Posture we lay by for them, and in a little while they came
up with us; but never was such a horrid Sight seen by Christians:
My Mate was much mistaken in his Calculation of their Number, I
mean of a thousand Canoes ; the most we could make of them when
they came up, being about a hundred and six-and-twenty; and a
great many of them too; for some of them had sixteen or seventeen
Men in them, and some more; and the least six or seven.
When they came nearer to us they seemed to be struck with
Wonder and Astonishment, as at a Sight which they had doubtless
never seen before; nor could they at first, as we afterwards under-
stood, know what to make of us: They came boldly up however
very near to us, and seemed to go about to row round us; but we
called to our Men in the Boats, not to let them come too near them.
This very Order brought us to an Engagement with them, without
our designing it; for five or six of their large Canoes came so near
our Long-Boat, that our Men beckon'd with their Hands to them to
keep back, which they understood very well, and went back; but at
their Retreat, about 50 Arrows came on board us from those Boats'
and one of our Men in the Lon^-Boat was very much wounded.
However, I called to them not to fire by any Means; but we handed
down some Deal-Boards into the Boat, and the Carpenter presently
set up a kind of a Fence, like waste Boards, to cover them from the
Arrows of the Savages, if they should shoot again.
About half an Hour afterwards they came all up in a Body aster
n
of us, and pretty near us, so near that we could easily discern what
they were, though we could not tell their Design : And I easily found
they were some of my old Friends, the same Sort of Savages that I
had been used to engage with; and in a little Time more they rowed
a little farther out to Sea, till they came directly Broad-side with us,
and then rowed down straight upon us, till they came so near, that they
could hear us speak: Upon this I order'd all my Men to keep close,
lest they should shoot any more Arrows, and made all our Guns
ready; but being so near as to be within hearing, I made Friday go
out upon the Deck, and call out aloud to them in his Language to know
what they meant, which accordingly he did ; whether they understood
him or not, that I knew not: But as soon as he had called to them, six
of them, who were in the foremost or nighest Boat to us, turns their
Canoes from us; and stooping down, showed us their naked Backsides,
just as if in English, saving your Presence, they had bid us kiss;
whether this was a Defiance or Challenge, we know not; or whether
it was done in mere Contempt, or as a Signal to the rest; but imme-
diately Friday cried out they were going to shoot, and unhappily for
him, poor Fellow, they let fly about 300 of their Arrows, and, to my
inexpressible Grief, kill'd poor Friday, no other Man being in their
Sight The poor Fellow was shot with no less than three Arrows,
and about three more fell very near him; such unlucky Marksmen
they were.
I was so enrag'd with the Loss of my old Servant, the Companion
of all my Sorrows and Solitudes, that I immediately order'd five Guns
to be loaded with small Shot, and four with great, and gave them
such a Broad-side, as they had never heard in their Lives before.
to be sure.
They were not above half a Cable Length off when we fired; and
our Gunners took their Aim so well, that three or four of their Canoes
were overset, as we had reason to believe, by one Shot only.
The ill manners of turning up their bare Backsides to us, gave us
no great Offence; neither did I know for certain, whether that which
would pass for the greatest Contempt among us, miKht hr. understood
so by them, or not; therefore in Return, I had only resolv'd to have
fired foui or five Guns at them with Powder only, which I knew
would fright them sufficiently: But when they shot at us directly
with all the Fury they were capable of, and especially as they had
killed my poor Friday, who I so entirely loved and valu'd, and who
indeed so well deserv'd it; I not only had been justify'd before Go<f
and Man, but would have been very glad, if I could, to have overset
every Canoe there, and drown'd every one of them.
I can neither tell, how many we killed, or how many we wounded
at this Broad-side; but sure such a Fright and Hurry never was seen
among such a Multitude; there were 13 or 14. of their Canoes split
and overset in all, and the Men all set a swimming; the rest frighted
out of their Wits, scoured away as fast as they could, taking but little
care to save those whose Boats were split or spoiled with our Shot:
So I suppose that they were many of them lost: And our Men took
up one poor Fellow swimming for his Life, above an Hour after they
were all gone.
Our small Shot from our Cannon must needs kill and wound a
great many; but, in short, we never knew anything how it went
with them; for they fled so fast, that in three Hours or thereabouts,
we could not see above three or four straggling Canoes; nor did we
ever see the rest any more; for a Breeze of Wind springing up the
same Evening, we weighed and set Sail for the Brasils.
We had a Prisoner indeed; but the Creature was so sullen, that he
would neither eat or speak; and we all fancy'd he would starve him-
self to Death: But I took a Way to cure him; for I made them take
him and turn him into the Long-Boat, and make him believe they
would toss him into the Sea again, and so leave him where they found
him, if he would not speak: Nor would that do; but they really did
throw him into the Sea, and came away from him; and then he fol-
low'd them, for he swam like a Cork, and called to them in his
Tongue, though they knew not one Word of what he said: However,
at last they took him in again, and then he began to be more tractable J
nor did I ever design they should drown him.
We were now under Sail again; but I was the most disconsolate
Creature alive, for want of my Man Friday, and would have been
very glad to have gone back to the Island, to have taken one of the
rest from thence for my Occasion, but it could not be; so we went on.
We had one Prisoner, as I have said; and 'twas a long while before
DEATH OF FRIDAY.
we could make him understand anything: But, in time, our Men
taught him some English, and he began to be a little tractable; after-
wards we inquir'd what Country he came from, but could make
nothing of what he said; for his Speech was so odd, all Gutturals, and
spoke in the Throat in such an hollow odd Manner, that we could
never form a Word from him; and we were all of opinion, that they
might speak that Language as well, if they were gagged, as otherwise:
Nor could we perceive that they had any Occasion, either for Teeth,
Tongue, Lips or Palate, but formed their Words, just as a hunting
Horn forms a Tune with an open Throat He told us however, some
time after when we had taught him to speak a little English, that they
were going with their Kings to fight a great Battle. When he said
Kings, we asked him how many Kings? He said, they were FIVE
NATION, we could not make him understand the Plural S. and
that they all joined to go against Two Nation. We asked him, what
made them come up to us? He said, to makce te great Wonder look:
Where it is to be observ'd, That all those Natives, as also those of
Africa, when they lear n English, they always add two E's at the End
of the Words where we use one, and make the Accent upon them, as
makeZ takli, and the like; and we could not break them of it; nay, I
could hardly make Friday leave it off, though at last he did.
And now I name the poor Fellow once more, I must take my last
Leave of him; poor honest Friday I We buried him with all the
Decency and Solemnity possible, by putting him into a Coffin, and
throwing him into the Sea: And I caused them to fire eleven Guns for
him ; and so ended the Life of the most grateful, faithful, honest, and
most affectionate Servant that ever Man had.
We went now away with a fair Wind for Brasil, and in about
twelve Days' Time we made Land in the Latitude of five Degrees
South of the Line, being the North Easternmost Land of all that Part
of America. We kept on S. by E. in Sight of the Shore four Days,
when we made Cape St. Augustine, and in three Days came to an
Anchor off of the Bay of All Saints, the old Place of my Deliverance,
from whence came both my good and evil Fate.
Never Ship came to this Part that had less Business than I had;
and yet it was with great Difficulty that we were admitted to hold the
least Correspondence on Shore; not my Partner himself, who was
alive, and made a great Figure among them; not my two Merchants
Trustees, not the Fame of my wonderful Preservation in that Island,
uu
could obtain me that Favour: But my Partner remembering, that 1
had given 500 Moidores to the Prior of the Monastery of the Augus-
tines, and 272 to the Poor, went to the Monastery, and oblig'd the
Prior that then was, to go to the Governor, and get leave for me per*
sonally, with the Captain and one more besides Eight Seamen, to
come on Shore, and no more; and this upon Condition absolutely
capitulated for, that we should not offer to land any Goods out of the
Ship, or to carry any Person away without Licence.
They were so strict with us, as to landing any Goods, that it was
with extreme Difficulty that I got on Shore three Bales of English
Goods, such as fine Broadcloths, Stuffs, and some Linen which I had
brought for a Present to my Partner.
He was a very generous broad-hearted Man, though like me, he
came from little at first; and though he knew not that I had the least
Design of giving him anything, he sent me on Board a Present of
fresh Provisions, Wine, and Sweetmeats, worth above 30 Moidores,
including some Tobacco, and three or four fine Medals in Gold: But
I was even with him in my Present, which, as I have said, consisted
of fine Broadcloth, English Stuffs, Lace, and fine Hollands: Also I
deliver'd him about the Value of 100 lib. Sterl. in the same Goods
for other Uses; and I oblig'd him to set up the Sloop which I had
brought with me from England, as I have said, for the Use of my
Colony, in order to send the Refreshments I intended to my
Plantation.
Accordingly, he got Hands and finish'd the Sloop in a very few
Days, for she was already framed, and I gave the Master of her such
Instructions, as he could not miss the Place, nor did he miss them, at
I had an Account from my Partner afterwards. I got him soon loaded
with the small Cargo I sent them; and one of our Seamen that had
been on shore with me there, offer'd to go with the Sloop, and settle
there upon my Letter to the Governor Spaniard, to allot him a suffi-
cient Quantity of Land for a Plantation; and giving him some
Clothes, and Tools for his Planting-work, which he said he under-
stood, having been an old Planter at Maryland, and a Buccaneer into
the Bargain.
I encourag'd the Fellow, by granting all he desir'd; and as an
Addition, I gave him the Savage, which we had taken Prisoner of
War, to be his Slave, and order'd the Governor Spaniard to give him
his share of everything he wanted, with the rest
When we came to fit this Man out, my old Partner told me, there
was a certain very honest Fellow, a Brasil Planter of his Acquain-
tance, who had fallen into the Displeasure of Jie Church; I know not
what the matter is with him, says he; but on my Conscience, I think
he is a Heretic in his Heart, and he has been oblig'd to conceal
himself for fear of the Inquisition; that he would be very glad of such
an Opportunity to make his Escape with his Wife and two Daugh-
ters; and if I would let them go to my Island, and allot them a
Plantation, he would give them a small stock to begin with; for the
Officers of the Inquisition had seized all his Effects and Estate, and
he had nothing left but a little Household-stuff and two Slaves. And,
adds he, Though I hate his Principles, yet I would not have him
fall into their Hands; for he would assuredly be burnt alive, if he
does.
I granted this presently, and joined my Englishman with them, and
we conceal'd the Man, and his Wife and Daughters on Board our
Ship, till the Sloop put out to go to Sea; and then (having put all
their Goods on board the Sloop, some time before) we put them on
board the Sloop, after he was got out of the Bay.
Our Seaman was mightily pleased with this new Partner; and their
Stock indeed was much alike, rich in Tools, in Preparations, and a
Farm, but nothing to begin with, but as above: However, they carried
over with them, which was worth all the rest, some Materials for
planting Sugar-canes, with some Plants of Canes; which he, I mean
the Portugal Man, understood very well.
Among the rest of the Supplies sent my Tenants in the Island, I
sent them by their Sloop, three Milch Cows, and five Calves, about
2 2 Hogs among them, three Sows big with Pig, two Mares, and a
Stone-horse.
For my Spaniards, according to my Promise, I engaged three Por-
tugal Women to go, and recommended it to them to marry them, and
nse them kindly. I could have procured more Women, but I re-
tnember'd, that the poor persecuted Man had two Daughters, and
there was but five of the Spaniards that wanted; the rest had Wives
of their own, though in another Country.
All this Cargo arriv'd safe, and as you may easily suppose, very
welcome to my old Inhabitants, who were now with this Addition,
between sixty and seventy People, besides little Children; of which
there was a great many: I found Letters at London from them all by
the Way of Lisbon, when I came back to England: of which I shall
also take some Notice immediately.
I have now done with my Island, and all Manner of Discourse
about it; and whoever reads the rest of my Memorandums, would do
well to turn his Thoughts entirely from it, and expect to read of the
Follies of an old Man, not warn'd by his own Harms, much less by
those of other Men, to beware of the like; not cooled by almost
forty Years' Misery and Disappointments, not satisfy'd with Prosperity
beyond Expectation, not made cautious by Affliction and Distress
beyond Imitation.
I had no more Business to go to the East Indies, than a Man at
full Liberty, and having committed no Crime, has to go to the
Turnkey at Newgate, and desire him to lock him up among the
Prisoners there, and starve him. Had I taken a small Vessel from
England, and went directly to the Island; had I loaded her, as I did
the other Vessel, with all the Necessaries for the Plantation, and for
my People; took a Patent from the Government here, to have secur'd
my Property, in subjection only to that of England; had I carried
over Cannon and Ammunition, Servants and People, to plant, and
taking possession of the Place, fortified and strengthen'd it in the
Name of England, and increas'd it with People, as I might easily
have done; had I then settled myself there, and sent the Ship back,
loaden with good Rice, as I might also have done in six Months'
time, and order'd my Friends to have fitted her out again for our
Supply; had I done this, and stayed there myself, I had, at least, acted
like a Man of common sense; but I was possest with a wandering
Spirit, scorned all Advantages, I pleased myself with being the Patron
of those People I placed there, and doing for them in a kind of
haughty majestic Way, like an old Patriarchal Monarch; providing
for them, as if I had been Father of the whole Family, as well as of
the Plantation: But I never so much as pretended to plant in the
Name of any Government or Nation, or to acknowledge any Prince,
or to call my People Subjects to any one Nation more than another;
nay, I never so much as gave the Place a Name; but left it as I found
it, belonging to no Man; and the People under no Discipline or
Government but my own; who, though I had influence over them as
Father and Benefactor, had no Authority or Power to Act or Command
one way or other, farther than voluntary Consent moved them to
comply; yet even this, had I stayed there, would have done well
enough; but as I rambl'd from them, and came there no more, the
last Letters I had from any of them, was by my Partner's Means;
who afterwards sent another Sloop to the Place, and who sent me
word, though I had not the Letter till five Years after it was written,
that they went on but poorly, were malcontent with their long stay
there: That Will Atkins was dead; That five of the Spaniards were
come away, and that though they had not been much molested by
the Savages, yet they had had some Skirmishes with them; That
they begged of him to write to me, to think of the Promise I had
made, to fetch them away, that they might see their own Country
again before they died.
But I was gone a Wild-Goose Chase indeed; and They who will
have any more of me, must be content to follow me through a new
Variety of Follies, Hardships, and Wild Adventures; wherein the
Justice of Providence may be duly observ'd, and we may see how
easily Heaven can gorge us with our own Desires; make the strongest
of our Wishes be our Affliction, and punish us most severely with
those very Things, which we think, it would be our utmost Happiness
to be allow'd in.
Let no wise Man flatter himself with the Strength of his own
Judgment, as if he was able to choose any particular Station of Life
for himself: Man is a short-sighted Creature, sees but a very little
Way before him; and as his Passions are none of his best Friends, so
his particular Affections are generally his worst Counsellors.
I say this, with Respect to the impetuous Desire I had from a
Youth, to wander into the World; and how evident it now was, that
this Principle was preserv'd in me for my Punishment: How it came
on, the Manner, the Circumstance, and the Conclusion of it, it is
easy to give you Historically, and with its utmost Variety of Particu«
lars: But the secret Ends of Divine Power, in thus permitting us to
be hurried down the Stream of our own Desires, is only to be under*
stood of those who can listen to the Voice of Providence, and draw
religious Consequences from God's Justice, and their own Mistakes.
Be it, I had Business, or no Business, away I went It is no Time
now to enlarge any farther upon the Reason, or Absurdity of my own
Conduct; but to come to the History, I was embark'd for the
Voyage, and the Voyage I went
I should only add here, that my Honest and truly pious Clergyman
left me here: a Ship being ready to ?o to Lisbon, he asked me Leave
to go thither, being still, as he observ'd, bound never to finish any
Voyage he began: How happy had it been for me, if I had gone
with him!
But it was too late now; all things Heaven appoints are best >
had I gone with him, I had never had had so many things to be thank-
ful for, and you had never heard of the second Part of the Travels
and Adventures of Robin. Crusoe; so I must leave here the fruit-
less exclaiming at myself, and go on with my Voyage.
From the Brasils, we made directly away over the Atlantic Sea, to
the Cap! de don Esperance, or as we call it, the Cape of Good Hope;
and had a tolerable good Voyage, our Course generally South-East;
now and then a storm, and some contrary Winds, but my Disasters
at Sea were at an end; my future Rubs and cross Events were to
befal me on shore; that it might appear the Land was as well pre-
par'd to be our scourge as the Sea; when Heaven, who directs the
Circumstances of Things, pleases to appoint it to be so.
Our Ship was on a Trading Voyage, and had a Supercargo on
board, who was to direct all her Motions after she arriv'd at the
Cape; only being limited to certain Numbers of Days, for stay, by
Charter-party, at the several Ports she was to go to: This was none
of my Business, neither did I meddle with it at all; my Nephew, the
Captain, and the Supercargo, adjusting all those things between
them, as they thought fit
We made no stay at the Cape longer than was needful to take in
fresh Water; but made the best of our way for the Coast of Coro-
manJrf. We were, indeed, inform'd that a French Man of War of fifty
Guns, and two large Merchant Ships, were gone for the Indies, and
as I knew we were at War with France, I had some Apprehensions ot
them; but they went their own Way, and we heard no more of them.
I shall not pester my Account, or the Reader, with Descriptions of
Places, Journals of our Voyages, Variations of Compass, Latitudes,
Meridian-Distances, Trade-Winds, Situation of Ports, and the like;
such as almost all the Histories of long Navigation are full of, and
makes the Reading tiresome enough, and are perfectly unprofitable
to all that read it, except only to those who are to go to those Places
themselves.
It is enough to name the Ports and Places which we touched at,
and what occurr'd to us upon our passing from one to another. We
touched first at the Island of Madagascar; where, though the People
4'9
are fierce and treacherous, and in particular very well armed with
Lances and Bows, which they use with inconceivable dexterity; yet
we fared very well with them awhile, they treated us very civilly; and
for some Trifles which we gave them, such as Knives, Scissors, cVv.,
they brought us eleven good fat Bullocks, middling in Size, but very
good in Flesh; which we took in, partly for fresh Provisions for our
present spending, and the rest to Salt for the Ship's Use.
Wc were obliged to stay here some Time after we had furnish'd
ourselves with Provisions; and I, that was always too curious, to look
into every Nook of the World wherever I came, was for going on
Shore as often as I could: it was on the East Side of the Island that
we went on Shore, one Evening; and the People, who by the Way
are very numerous, came thronging about us, and stood gazing at us
at a Distance; but as we had traded freely with them, and had been
kindly used, we thought ourselves in no Danger; but when we saw
the People, we cut three Boughs out of a Tree, and stuck them up
at a Distance from us, which it seems is a Mark in the Country not
only of Truce and Friendship, but when it is accepted, the other Side
set up three Poles or Boughs, which is a Signal that they accept the
Truce too; but then, this is a known Condition of the Truce, that you
axe not to pass beyond their three Poles towards them, nor they to
come past your three Poles or Boughs towards you; so that you are
perfectly secure within the three Poles, and all the Space between
your Poles and theirs, is allow'd like a Market, for free Converse,
Traffic, and Commerce: When you go there, you must not carry
your Weapons with you; and if they come into that Space they
stick up their Javelins and Lances, all at the first Poles, and come on
unarm'd; but if any Violence is offer'd them, and the Truce thereby
broken, away they run to the Poles, and lay hold of their Weapons,
and then the Truce is at an End.
It happen'd one Evening when we went on Shore, that a greater
Number of their People came down than usual, but all was very
friendly and civil, and they brought in several Kinds of Provisions,
for which we satisfied them, with such Toys as we had; their
Women also brought us Milk, and Roots, and several Things
very acceptable to us, and all was quiet; and we made us a
fittle Tent, or Hut, of some Boughs of Trees, and lay on Shore all
Night
I know not what was the Occasion, but I was not so well satisfied
to lie on Shore as the rest, and the Boat lying at an Anchor, about a
Stone cast from the Land, with two Men in her to take care of her ; I
made one of them come on shore, and getting some Boughs of Trees
to cover us also in the Boat, I spread the Sail on the Bottom of the
Boat, and lay under the Cover of the Branches of Trees all Night in
the Boat
About two o'clock in the Morning, we heard one of our Men make
a terrible Noise on the shore, calling out for God's sake to bring the
Boat in, and come and help them, for they were all like to be
murder'd; at the same time I heard the firing of 5 Muskets,
which was the Number of the Guns they had, and that three
times over; for it seems the Natives here were not so easily frighted
with Guns, as the Savages were in America, where I had to do with
them.
All this while I knew not what was the matter; but rousing imme ,
diately from Sleep with the Noise, I caused the Boat to be thrust in,
and resolv'd, with three Fusils we had on board, to land and assist
our Men.
We got the Boat soon to the Shore, but our Men were in too much
Haste: For being come to the shore, they plunged into the Water to
get to the Boat with all the Expedition they could, being pursued by
between three and four hundred Men: our Men were but Nine in
all, and only five of them had Fusils with them; the rest had indeed
Pistols and Swords, but they were of small use to them.
We took up seven of our Men, and with Difficulty enough too, three
of them being very ill wounded; and that which was still worse was,
that while we stood in the Boat to take our Men in, we were in as
much Danger as they were in on Shore; for they poured their Arrows
in upon us so thick that we were fain to barricade the Side of the
Boat up with the Benches, and two or three loose Boards, which to
our great Satisfaction we had by mere Accident or Providence in
the Boat"
And yet, had it been Daylight, they are it seems such exact
Marksmen, that if they could have seen but the least Part of any of
us, they would have been sure of us; we had by the Light of the
Moon a little Sight of them, as they stood pelting us from the Shore
with Darts and Arrows; and having got ready our Fire-arms, we
gave them a Volley, that we could hear by the Cries of some of them,
that wc had wounded several; however, they stood thus in Battle
Array on the Shore till break of Day, which we suppose was, that
they might see the better to take their Aim at us.
In this Condition we lay, and could not tell how to weigh our
Anchor or set up our Sail, because we must needs stand up in the
Boat, and they were as sure to hit us, as we were to hit a Bird in a
Tree with small Shot; we made Signals of Distress to the Ship,
which, though we rode a League off, yet my Nephew the Captain
hearing our Firing, and by Glasses perceiving the Posture we lay in,
and that we fired towards the Shore, pretty well understood us; and
weighing Anchor, with all speed, he stood as near the Shore as he durst
with the Ship, and then sent another Boat with ten Hands in her to
assist us; but we call'd to them not to come too near, telling them
what Condition we were in: However, they stood in nearer to us;
and one of the Men taking the End of a Tow-Line in his Hand, and
keeping our Boat between him and the Enemy, so that they could not
perfectly see him, swam on board us, and made fast the Line to the
Boat; upon which we slipped our little Cable, and leaving oui
Anchor behind, they towed us out of reach of the Arrows, we all the
while lying close behind the Barricado we had made.
As soon as we were got from between the Ship and the Shore, that
she could lay her Side to the Shore, she run along just by them, and we
poured in a Broadside among them loaden with Pieces of Iron and
Lead, small Bullets, and such stuff, besides the great Shot, which
made a terrible Havoc amongst them.
When we were got on board and out of Danger, we had time to
examine into the Occasion of this Fray; and indeed our Supercargo
who had been often in those Parts, put me upon it; for he said, he
was sure the Inhabitants would not have touched us after we had
made a Truce, if we had not done something to provoke them to it
At length it came out (viz.) that an Old Woman who had come to
sell us some Milk, had brought it within our Poles, with a young
Woman with her, who also brought some Roots or Herbs; and
while the Old Woman, whether she was Mother to the young Woman
or no, they could not tell, was selling us the Milk, one of our Men
offer'd some Rudeness to the Wench that was with her, at which the
old Woman made a great Noise: However, the Seaman would not
quit his Prize, but carry'd her out of the old Woman's Sight among
the Trees, it being almost dark; the old Woman went away without
her, and as we suppose, made an Outcry among the People she came
from; who upon Notice, raised this great Army upon us in three
or four Hours; and it was great odds, but we had been all
destroy'd.
One of our Men was kill'd with a Lance thrown at him just at the
beginning of the Attack, as he sally'd out of the Tent they had made;
the rest came off free, all but the Fellow who was the Occasion of all
the Mischief, who paid dear enough for his black Mistress; for we
could not hear what became of him, a great while; we lay upon the
Shore two Days after, though the Wind presented, and made Signals
for him; made our Boat sail up Shore and down Shore, several
Leagues, but in vain; so we were oblig^ to give him over, and if he
alone had suffer'd for it, the Loss had been the less.
I could not satisfy myself, however, without venturing on Shore
once more, to try if I could learn anything of him or them; it was the
third Night after the Action, that I had a great Mind to lear n if I
could by any Means what Mischief we had done, and how the Game
stood on the Indians' Side: I was careful to do it in the Dark, lest
we should be attack'd again; but I ought indeed to have been sure,
that the Men I went with had been under my Command, before I
engag'd in a Thing so hazardous and mischievous as I was brought
into by it, without my Knowledge or Design.
We took twenty stout Fellows with us as any in the Ship, besides
the Supercargo and myself, and we landed two Hours before Mid-
night, at the same Place where the Indians stood drawn up the
Evening before; I landed here, because my Design as I have said,
was chiefly to see if they had quitted the Field, and if they had left
any Marks behind them of the Mischief we had done them; and I
thought, if we could surprise one or two of them, perhaps we might
get our Man again by Way of Exchange.
We landed without any Noise, and divided our Men into two
Bodies, whereof the Boatswain commanded one, and I the other;
we neither saw or heard anybody stir when we landed, and we
marched up one Body at a Distance from the other, to the Place, but
at first could see nothing it being very dark; till by and by, our
Boatswain that led the first Party, stumbled and fell over a Dead
Boy; this made them halt awhile, for knowing by the Circum-
stances that they were at the Place where the Indians had stood, they
waited for my coming up here; we concluded to halt till the Moon
began to rise, which we knew would be in less than an Hour, when
we could easily discern the Havoc we had made among them; we
toid two-and-thirty Bodies upon the Ground, whereof t«vo were not
quite dead: Some had an Arm, and some a Leg shot off, and one
his Head; those that were wounded we suppos'd they had carried
away.
When we had made, as I thought, a full Discovery of all we could
come at the Knowledge of, I was resolv'd for going on board; but
the Boatswain and his Party sent me Word, that they were resolv'd
to make a Visit to the Indian Town, where these Dogs, as they
called them, dwelt, and asked me to go along with them ; and if they
could find them, as still they fancied they should, they did not doubt
getting a good Booty, and it might be, they might find Tho. Jeffry
there, that was the Maris Name we had lost.
Had they sent to ask my Leave to go, I knew well enough what
Answer to have given them; for I would have commanded them
instantly on Board, knowing it was not a Hazard fit for us to run,
who had a Ship, and Ship-loading in our Charge, and a Voyage to
make, which depended very much upon the Lives of the Men; but
as they sent me Word they were resolv'd to go, and only asked me
and my Company to go along with them, I positively refus'd it, an<f
rose up, for I was sitting on the Ground, in Order to go to the Boat;
one or two of the Men began to importune me to go, and when I
refus'd positively, began to grumble, and say they were not under my
Command, and they would go: Come, Jack, says one of the
Men, will go with me? I'll go for one. Jack said he would, and
another followed, and then another; and in a Word, they all left me
but one, who I persuaded to stay, and a Boy left in the Boat; so
the Supercargo and I, with the third Man, went back to the
Boat, where we told them we would stay for them, and take Care to
take in as many of them as should be left; for I told them it was a
mad Thing they were going about, and supposed most of them would
run the Fate of Thorn. Jeffry.
They told me, like Seamen, they'd warrant it they would come off
again, and they would take care, Grc. So away they went; I en-
treated them to consider the Ship and Voyage; that their Lives were
not their own, and that they were entrusted with the Voyage in some
measure; that if they miscarry'd, the Ship might be lost for want of
their Help, and that they could not answer it to God or Man. I said
a great deal more to them on that Head, but I might as well have
talked to the Mainmast of the Ship, they were mad upon their
Journey, only they gave me good Words, and begged I would not be
angry; That they would be very cautious, and they did not doubt
but they would be back again in about an Hour at farthest; for the
Indian Town, they said, was not above half a Mile off, though they
found it above two Miles before they got to it
Well, they all went away, as above; and though the Attempt was
desperate, and such as none but mad Men would have gone about,
yet to give them their due, they went about it warily as boldly:
They were gallantly armed, that's true; for they had every Man a
Fusee or Musket, a Bayonet, every Man a Pistol; some of them
had broad Cutlasses, some of them Hangers, and the Boatswain and
Two more had Pole-Axes: Besides all which, they had among them
Thirteen Hand-Grenadoes. Bolder Fellows, and better provided,
never went about any wicked Work in the World.
When they went out, their chief Design was Plunder, and they were
in mighty hopes of finding Gold there; but a Circumstance which none
of them were aware of, set them on fire with Revenge, and made
Devils of them all. When they came to the few Indian Houses
which they thought had been the Town, which was not above half a
Mile off; they were under a great Disappointment; for there were not
above 12 or 13 Houses; and where the Town was, or how big, they
knew not: They consulted therefore what to do, and were some time
before they could resolve: for if they fell upon these, they must cut
all their Throats, and it was ten to one but some of them might
escape, it being in the Night, though the Moon was up; and if one
escap'd, he would run away, and raise all the Town, so they should
have a whole Army upon them: Again, on the other hand, if they
went away, and left those untouch'd (for the People were all asleep)
they could not tell which Way to look for the Town.
However, the last was the best Advice; so they resolv'd to leave
them, and look for the Town as well as they could . They went on a
little way, and found a Cow tied to a Tree; this they presently con-
cluded, would be a good Guide to them; for they said, the Cow cer-
tainly belonged to the Town before them, or the Town behind them;
and if they untied her, they should see which way she went; if she
went back, they had nothing to say to her; but if she went forward,
they had nothing to do but to follow her: So they cut the Cord, which
was made of twisted Flags, and the Cow went on before them; in a
4*5
Word, the Cow led them directly to the Town, which as they report,
consisted of above 200 Houses or Huts; and in some of these they
found several Families living together.
Here they found all in Silence, as profoundly secure, as Sleep, and a
Country that had never seen an Eneiliy of that Kind could make
them; and first, they called another Council, to consider what they
had to do; and in a Word, they resolv'd to divide themselves into
three Bodies, and to set three Houses on Fire in three Parts of the
Town; and as the Men came out, to seize them and bind them ; if any
resisted, they need not be asked what to do then, and so to search
the rest of the Houses for Plunder; but they resolv'd to marcb
silently first through the Town, and see what Dimensions it was of,
and if they might venture upon it or no.
They did so, and desperately resolv'd that they would venture upon
them; but while they were animating one another to the Work, three
of them that were a little before the rest, called out aloud to them,
and told them they had found Thorn. Jeffry; they all run up to the
Place, and so it was indeed; for there they found the poor Fellow
hanged up naked by one Arm, and his Throat cut; there was an
Indian House just by the Tree, where they found sixteen or seventeen
of the principal Indians who had been concern'd in the Fray with us
before; and two or three of them wounded with our Shot; and our
Men found they were awake, and talking one to another in that
House, but knew not their Number.
The Sight of their poor mangled Comrade so enrag'd them, as before,
that they swore to one another they would be reveng'd, and that
not an Indian who came into their Hands should have Quarter, and
to work they went immediately; and yet not so madly as by the Rage
and Fury they were in might be expected. Their first Care was to
get something that would soon take Fire; but after a little search,
they found that would be to no Purpose; but most of the Houses were
low, and Thatched with Flags or Rushes, of which the Country is full;
so they presently made some wild Fire, as we call it, by wetting a
little Powder in the Palms of their hands, and in a quarter of an
Hour they set the Town on fire in four or five Places; and particu-
larly that House where the Indians were not gone to Bed. As soon
as the Fire began to blaze, the poor frighted Creatures began to rush
out to save their Lives; but met with their Fate in the Attempt, and
especially at the Door, where they drove them baci, the Boatswain
himself killing one or two with his Pole-Axe; the Hoase being
large, and many in it, he did not care to go in, but called for a Hand-
Grenado, and threw it among them, which at first frighted them; but
when it burst, made such Havoc among them, that they cried out i*
a hideous manner.
In short, most of the Indians who were in the open Part of the
House were killed or hurt with the Grenado, except two or three
more who pressed to the Door, which the Boatswain and two more
kept with their Bayonets in the Muzzles of their Pieces, and dispatch'd
all who came that Way. But there was another Apartment in the
House where the Prince or King, or whatever he was, and several
others were, and these they kept in till the House, which was. by this
time all of a light Flame, fell in upon them, and they were smother'd
or burnt together.
All this while they fired not a Gun, because they would not waken
the People faster than they could master them; but the Fire began
to waken them fast enough, and our Fellows were glad to keep a little
together in Bodies, for the Fire grew so raging, all the Houses being
made of light combustible Stuff, that they could hardly bear the
Street between them, and their Business was to follow the Fire for
the surer Execution: As fast as the Fire either forced the People
out of those Houses which were burning, or frighted them out of
others, our People were ready at their Doors to knock them on
the Head, still calling and hallooing to one another to remember
Thorn. Jeftry.
While this was doing, I must confess I was very uneasy, and
especially when I saw the Flames of the Town, which, it being Night,
seemed to be just by me.
My Nephew, the Captain, who was roused by his Men too, seeing
such a Fire, was very uneasy, not knowing what the Matter was, or
what Danger I was in; especially hearing the Guns too; for by this
time they began to use their Fire-Arms; a thousand Thoughts op-
press'd his Mind concerning me and the Supercargo, what should
become of us: And at last, though he could ill spare any more Men,
yet not knowing what Exigence we might be in, he takes another
Boat, and with 13 Men and himself, comes on Shore to me.
He was surpris'd to see me and the Supercargo in the Boat with
no more than two Men; and though he was glad that we were well,
yet he was in the same Impatience with us to know what was doing;
for the Noise continu'd and the Flame increas'd: In short, it was
next to an Impossibility for any Men in the World to restrain their
Curiosity to know what had happen'd, or the Concern for the
Safety of the Men: In a Word, the Captain told me, he would go and
help his Men, let what would come. I argu'd with him as I did
before with the Men, the Safety of the Ship, the Danger of the
Voyage, the Interest of the Owners and Merchants, Grc. and told
him, I would go and the two Men, and only see if we could at a
Distance learn what was like to be the Event, and come back and
tell him.
It was all one, to talk to my Nephew, as it was to talk to the rest
before; he would go he said, and he only wished he had left but Ten
Men in the Ship; for he could not think of having his Men lost for
want of Help; he had rather lose the Ship, the Voyage, and his Life
and all; and away went he.
In a Word, I was no more able to stay behind now, than I was to
persuade them not to go; so in short, the Captain order'd two Men
to row back the Pinnace, and fetch twelve Men more, leaving the
Long-Boat at an Anchor, and that when they came back, six Men
should keep the two Boats, and six more come after us; so that he
left only 16 Men in the Ship; for the whole Ship's Company consisted
of 65 Men, whereof two were lost in the last Quarrel, which brought
this Mischief on.
Being now on the March, you may be sure we felt little of the
Ground we trode on ; and being guided by the Fire, we kept no Path,
Vt went directly to the Place of the Flame: If the Noise of the
Guns was surprising to us before, the Cries of the poor People were
now of quite another Nature, and filled us with Horror. I must
confess, I never was at the sacking a City, or at the taking a Town
by storm. I had heard of Oliver Cromwell taking Xh-ogheda in
Ireland, and killing Man, Woman and Child: And I had read of
Count Tilly, sacking of the City of Magdeburgh, and cutting me Throats
of 22,000 of all Sexes: But I never had an Idea of the Thing itself
before, nor is it possible to describe it, or the Horror which was upon
our Minds at hearing it
However, we went on, and at length came to the Town, though
there was no entering the Streets of it for the Fire. The first Object
we met with was the Ruins of a Hut or House, or rather the Ashes
of it, for the House wa5 'onsum'd; and just before it, plain now to
be seen by the Light of the Fire, lay four Men and three Women
killed; and as we thought, one or two more lay in the Heap among
the Fire. In short there were such Instances of a Rage altogether
barbarous, and of a Fury something beyond what was human, that we
thought it impossible our Men could be guilty of it, or if they were
the Authors of it, we thought they ought to be every one of them put to
the worst of Deaths. But this was not all, we saw the Fire increas'd
forward, and the Cry went on just as the Fire went on; so that we
were in the utmost Confusion. We advanc'd a little Way farther, and
behold, to our Astonishment, three Women naked, and crying in a
most dreadful Manner, come flying, as if they had indeed had Wings,
and after them sixteen or seventeen Men, Natives, in the same Terror
and Consternation, with three of our English Butchers, for I can call
them no better, in their Rear, who, when they could not overtake
them, fired in among them, and one that was killed by their Shot fell
down in our Sight; when the rest saw us, believing us to be their
Enemies, and that we would murder them as well as those that pur-
sued them, they set up a most dreadful Shriek, especially the Women;
and two of them fell down as if already dead with the Fright
My very Soul shrunk within me, and my Blood run chill in my
Veins, when I saw this; and I believe, had the three English Sailors
that pursu'd them come on, I had made our Men kill them all:
However we took some Ways to let the poor flying Creatures know,
that we would not hurt them, and immediately they came up to us,
and kneeling down, with their Hands lifted up, made piteous Lamenta-
tion to us to save them, which we let them know we would; where-
upon they crept all together in a Huddle close behind us, as for
Protection. I left my Men drawn up together, and charged them to
hurt nobody, but if possible to get at some of our People, and see
what Devil it was possess'd them, and what they intended to do ; and
in a word, to command them off, assuring them that if they stayed
till Daylight, they would have an hundred thousand Men about their
Ears: I say, I left them, and went among those flying People, taking
only two of our Men with me; and there was indeed a piteous Spec-
tacle among them: Some of them had their Feet terribly burnt with
trampling and running through the Fire, others their Hands burnt;
one of the Women had fallen down in the Fire, and was very much
burnt before she could get out again, and two or three of the
Men had Cuts in their Backs and Thighs from our Men pur-
string; and another was shot through the Body, and died while I
was there.
I would fain have learned what the Occasion of all this was, but I
could not understand one Word they said; though by Signs I perceived
that some of them knew not what was the Occasion themselves. I
was so terrified in my Thoughts at this outrageous Attempt, that I
could not stay there; but went back to my own Men, and resolVd to
go into the Middle of the Town through the Fire, or whatever might be
in the Way, and put an End to it, cost what it would: Accordingly,
as soon as I came back to my Men, I told them my Resolution, and
commanded them to follow me, when in the very Moment came four
01 our Men with the Boatswain at their Head, roving over the Heaps
of Bodies they had killed, all cover'd with Blood and Dust, as if they
wanted more People to massacre, when our Men halloo'd to them as
\oud as they could halloo, and with much ado one of them made them
near; so that they knew who we were, and came up to us.
As soon as the Boatswain saw us, he set up a Halloo like a Shout
of Triumph, for having, as he thought, more help come, and without
bearing to hear me, Captain, says he, noble Captain, I am glad you
are come; we have not half done yet, villanous Hell-hound Dogs;
I'll kill as many of them as poor Tom has Hairs upon his Head. We
have sworn to spare none of them; we'll root out the very Nation 0/
them from the Earth. And thus he run on, out of Breath too witb
Action, and would not give us leave to speak a Word.
At last raising my Voice, that I might silence him a little, Barba-
rous Dog, said I, what are you doing? I won't have one Creature
touched more, upon pain of Death. I charge you upon your Life, to
stop your Hands, and stand still here, or you are a dead Man this
Minute.
Why, Sir, says he, Do you know what you do, or what they have
done? If you want a Reason for what we have done, come hither; and
with that he showed me the poor Fellow hanging with his Throat cut
I confess, I was urged then myself, and at another time should
have been forward enough; but I thought they had carried their Rage
too far, and thought of Jacob's Words to his Sons Simeon and Levi;
Cursed be their Anger, for it was fierce; and their Wrath, for it wot
cruel: But I had now a new Task upon my hands; for when the
Men I carried with me saw the Sight as I had done, I had as much
to do to restrain them, as I should have had with the other: vzx,
11
my Nephew himself fell in with them, and told me in their hearing
that he was only concern'd for fear of the Men being overpower'd;
for as to the People, he thought not one of them ought to live; for
they had all glutted themselves with the Murder of the poor Man, and
that they ought to be used like Murderers. Upon these Words, away
run eight of my Men with the Boatswain and his Crew, to complete
their bloody Work; and I seeing it quite out of my Power to restrain
them, came away pensive and sad; for I could not bear the Sight,
much less the horrible Noise and Cries of the poor Wretches that fell
into their Hands.
I got nobody to come back with me but the Supercargo and two
Men; and with these I walked back to the Boats. It was a very
great Piece of Folly in me, I confess, to venture back, as it were
alone; for as it began now to be almost Day, and the Alarm had run
over the Country, there stood about 40 Men armed with Lancei
and Bows at the little Place where the 12 or 13 Houses stood men-
tion'd before; but by Accident I missed the Place, and came directly
to the Sea-side, and by the time I got to the Sea-side it was broad
Day; immediately I took the Pinnace, and went aboard, and sent
her back to assist the Men in what might happen.
I observ'd about the Time that I came to the Boat-side, that the
Fire was pretty well out, and the Noise abated; but in about half an
Hour after I got on Board, I heard a Volley of our Men's Fire-arms,
and saw a great Smoke; this, as I understood afterwards, was out
Men falling upon the Men who as I said stood at the few Houses
on the Way, of whom they killed sixteen or seventeen, and set all
those Houses on Fire, but did not meddle with the Women or
Children.
By that Time the Men got to the Shore again with the Pinnace,
our Men began to appear; they came dropping in, some and sorne,
not in two Bodies, and in Form as they went, but all in Heaps,
straggling here and there, in such a Manner, that a small Force of re-
solute Men might have cut them all off.
But the Dread of them was upon the whole Country; and the Men
were amaz'd, and surpris'd, and so frighted, I believe a hundred of
them would have fled at the Sight of but five of our Men. Nor in
All this terrible Action was there a Man who made any considerable
Defence, they were so surpris'd between the Terror of the Fire, and
the sudden Attack of our Men in the Dark, that they knew not which
Way to turn themselves; for if they fled one Way, they were met by
one Party; if back again, by another: So that they were everywhere
knocked down: Nor did any of our Men receive the least hurt; ex-
cept one who strained his Foot, and another had one of his Hands
very much burnt
I was very angry with my Nephew the Captain, and indeed with
all the Men in my Mind, but with him in particular; as well for his
acting so out of his Duty as Commander of the Ship, and having the
Charge of the Voyage upon him, as in his prompting rather than cool-
ing the Rage of his Men in so bloody and cruel an Enterprise. My
Nephew answer'd me very respectfully; but told me, that when he
saw the Body of the poor Seaman, whom they had murder'd in such a
cruel and barbarous manner, he was not Master of himself, neithei
could he govern his Passion. He owned, he should not have done
so, as he was Commander of the Ship; but as he was a Man, and
Nature moved him, he could not bear it As for the rest of the Men,
they were not subject to me at all, and they knew it well enough; so
they took no notice of my Dislike.
The next Day we set sail, so we never heard any more of it: Ou'
Men differ'd in the Account of the Number they killed: Some said
one Thing, some another; but according to the best of their Accounts
put all together, they killed or destroy'd about 150 People, Men,
Women, and Children, and left not a House standing in the Town.
As for the poor Fellow Tho. Jeffry, as he was quite dead, for his
Throat was so cut, that his Head was half off, it would do him no
Service to bring him away, so they left him where they found him, only
took him down from the Tree where he was hanged by one Hand.
However just our Men thought this Action, I was against them in
It; and I always, after that Time, told them, God would blast the
Voyage; for I looked upon all the Blood they shed that Night to be
Murder in them: For though it is true, that they had killed Tho.Jcffry,
yet it was as true that Jeffry was the Aggressor, had broken the
Truce, and had violated or debauch'd a young Woman of theirs who
came down to them innocently, and on the Faith of their public
Capitulation.
The Boatswain defended this Quarrel when we were afterwards on
board: He said, It is true that we seemed to break the Truce, but
really had not, and that the War was begun the Night before by the
Natives themselves, who had shot us, and killed one of our Men
without any just Provocation; so that as we were in a Capacity to fight
them now, we might also be in a Capacity to do ourselves Justice
upon them in an extraordinary Manner, that though the poor Man had
taken a little Liberty with a Wench, he ought not to have been
murder'd, and that in such a villanous Manner: and that they did
nothing but what was just, and what the Laws of God allow'd to
be done to Murderers.
One would think this should have been enough to have warned ua
against going on Shore among Heathens and Barbarians: But it is
impossible to make Mankind wise, but at their own Expense,
and their Experience seems to be always of most Use to them
when it is dearest bought
We are now bound to the Gulf of Persia, and from thence to
the Coast of Coromandel, only to touch at Surra/: But the chief of
the Supercargo's Design lay at the Bay of Bengal, where if he
missed of his Business outward bound, he was to go up to China, and
return to the Coast as he came Home.
The first Disaster that befel us, was in the Gulf of Persia, where
five of our Men venturing on Shore on the Arabian Side of the Gulf,
were surrounded by the Arabians, and either all killed or carry'd
away into Slavery; the rest of the Boat's Crew were not able to rescue
them, and had but just Time to get off their Boat I began to up-
braid them with the just Retribution of Heaven in this Case: But the
Boatswain very warmly told me, he thought I went farther in my
Censures than I could show any Warrant for in Scripture, and referr'd
*;o the 13 St Luke, Verse 4th, where our Saviour intimates, that those
Men, on whom the Tower of Siloam fell, were not Sinners above all
the Galileans: But that which indeed put me to Silence in the Case,
was, That not one of these five Men, who were now lost, were of the
Number of those who went on Shore to the Massacre of Madagascar;
(so I always called it, though our Men could not bear the Word Massacre
with any Patience:) And indeed, this last Circumstance, as I have
said, put me to Silence for the present
But my frequent preaching to them on this Subject had worse
Consequences than I expected; and the Boatswain, who had been
the Head of the Attempt, came up boldly to me one Time, and told
me he found that I continually brought that Affair upon the Stage,
that I made unjust Reflections upon it, and had used the Men very
ill on that Account, and himself in particular; that as I was but a
Passenger, and had no Command in the Ship, or Concern in the
Voyage, they were not oblig'd to bear it; that they did not know, but
I might have some ill Design in my Head, and perhaps to call them
to Account for it, when they came to England; and that therefore,
unless I would resolve to have done with it; and also, not to concern
myself any farther with him, or any of his Affairs, he would leave the
Ship; for he did not think it was safe to sail with me among them.
I heard him patiently enough till he had done, and then told hirr
that I did confess I had all along oppos'd the Massacre of Madagascar-,
for such I would always call it; and that I had on all Occasions
spoken my Mind freely about it, though not more upon him than any
of the rest: That as to my having no Command in the Ship, that was
true; nor did I exercise any Authority, only took my Liberty of
speaking my Mind in Things which publicly concern'd us all; and
what Concern I had in the Voyage was none of his Business; that I
was a considerable Owner of the Ship; and in that Claim I conceiv'd
I had a Right to speak even farther than I had yet done, and would
J»t be accountable to him or any one else, and begun to be a little
warm with him: He made but little Reply to me at that Time, and
I thought that Affair had been over. We were at this Time in the
Road at Bengal, and being willing to see the Place, I went on Shore
with the Supercargo in the Ship's Boat, to divert myself, and towards
Evening was preparing to go on Board, when one of the Men came
to me, and told me, he would not have me trouble myself to come
down to the Boat, for they had Orders not to carry me on Board any
more. Any one may guess what a Surprise I was in at so insolent a
Message; and I asked the Man, who bade him deliver that Errand to
me? He told me, the Coxswain. I said no more to the Fellow,
but bade him let them know he had deliver'd his Message, and that I
had given him no Answer to it
I immediately went and found out the Supercargo, and told him
the Story, adding what I presently foresaw, (viz.) That there would
certainly be a Mutiny in the Ship, and entreated him to go imme-
diately on Board the Ship in an Indian Boat, and acquaint the
Captain of it: But I might have spared this Intelligence; for before
I had spoken to him on Shore, the Matter was effected on Board.
The Boatswain, the Gunner, the Carpenter; and in a Word, all the
Inferior Officers, as soon as I was gone off in the Boat, came up to
the Quarter-Deck, and desir'd to speak with the Captain, and there
ADVENTURES OF
the Boatswain making a long Harangue, for the Fellow talked very
well, and repeating all he had said to me, told the Captain in few
Words, That as I was now gone peaceably on Shore, they were lotb
to use any Violence with me; which, if I had not gone on Shore, they
would otherwise have done, to oblige me to have gone: They there-
fore thought fit to tell him, That as they shipp'd themselves to serve
in the Ship under his Command, they would perform it well and
faithfully: But if I would not quit the Ship, or the Captain oblige me
to quit it, they would all leave the Ship, and sail no farther with him;
and at that Word, ALL, he turned his Face about towards the Main-
mast, which was it seems the Signal agreed on between them; at
which, all the Seamen being got together, they cried out, One and
ALL, One and ALL
My Nephew, the Captain, was a Man of Spirit, and of great
Presence of Mind; and though he was surprls'd, you may be sure, at
the Thing, yet he told them calmly, that he would consider of the
Thing, but that he could do nothing in it till he had spoken to me
about it He used some Arguments with them, to show them the
Unreasonableness and Injustice of the Thing: But it was all in vain,
they swore and shook Hands round before his Face, that they would
go all on Shore, unless he would engage to them, not to suffer me to
come any more on Board the Ship.
This was a hard Article upon him, who knew his Obligation to me,
and did not know how I might take it; so he began to talk cavalierly
to them, told them that I was a very considerable Owner of the Ship,
and that in Justice he could not put me out of my own House; that
this was next Door to serving me, as the famous Pirate Kid had done,
who made the Mutiny in a Ship, set the Captain on Shore in an un-
inhabited Island, and run away with the Ship; that let them go into
what Ship they would, if ever they came to England again, it would
cost them dear; that the Ship was mine, and that he could not put
me out of it; and that he would rather lose the Ship and the Voyage
too, than disoblige me so much; so they might do as they pleased:
However, he would go on Shore, and talk with me on Shore, and in-
vited the Boatswain to go with me, and perhaps they might accom
modate the Matter with me.
But they all rejected the Proposal, and said, they would have
nothing to do with me any more, neither on Board or on Shore; and
if I came on Board, they would all go on Shore. Well, said the
Captain, if you are all of this Mind, let me go on Shore and talk with
him; so away he came to me with this Account, a little after the
Message had been brought to me from the Coxswain.
I was very glad to see my Nephew, I must confess; for I was not
without Apprehensions, that they would confine him by Violence, set
Sail, and run away with the Ship, and then I had been stripped naked
in a remote Country, and nothing to help myself: In short, I had
been in a worse Case, than when I was all alone in the Island.
But they had not come that length, it seems, to my great satisfac-
tion; and when my Nephew told me what they had said to him, and
how they had sworn, and shook Hands, that they would one and all
leave the Ship, if I was suffer'd to come on Board, I told him,
he should not be concern'd at it at all, for I would stay on Shore. I
only desir'd he would take Care and send me all my necessary
Things on Shore, and leave me a sufficient Sum of Money, and I
would find my Way to England, as well as I could.
This was a heavy Piece of News to my Nephew; but there was no
Way to help it, but to comply with it: So,'in short, he went on Board
the Ship again, and satisf/d the Men, that his Uncle had yielded to
their Importunity, and had sent for his Goods from on Board the
Ship; so that Matter was over in a very few Hours, the Men return'd
to their Duty, and I began to consider what Course I should steer.
I was now alone in the remotest Part of the World, as I think I
may call it; for I was near three thousand Leagues by Sea farther off
from England, than I was at my Island; only it is true, I might travel
here by Land over the Great Mogul's Country to Sural, might gc
from thence to Bassora by Sea, up the Gulf of Persia, and from
thence might take the Way of the Caravans over the Desert of Arabia
to Aleppo and Scanderoon; from thence by Sea again to Italy, and so
over Land into France, and this put together might be, at least, a full
Diameter of the Globe; but if it were to be measur'd, I suppose it
would appear to be a great deal more.
I had another Way before me, which was to wait for some English
Ships, which were coming to Bengal from Achin on the Island of
Sumatra, and get Passage on Board them for England: But as I came
hither without any Concern with the English East-India Company, so
it would be difficult to go from hence without their Licence, unless
with great Favour of the Captains of the Ships, or of the Company's
Factors, and to both, I was an utter Stranger.
Here I had the particular Pleasure, speaking by Contraries, to see
the Ship set sail without me, a Treatment I think a Man in my Circum-
stances scarce ever met with, except from Pirates running away with
a Ship, and setting those that would not agree with their Villany, on
Shore: Indeed this was next Door to it, both Ways; however, my
Nephew left me two Servants, or rather one Companion, and one
Servant, the first was Clerk to the Purser, who he engag'd to go
with me, and the other was his own Servant; I took me also a good
Lodging in the House of an Englishwoman, where several Merchants
lodged; some French, two Italians, or rather Jews, and one English-
man: Here I was handsomely enough entertain'd; and that I might
not be said to run rashly upon anything, I stayed here above nine
Months, considering what Course to take, and how to manage myself.
I had some English Goods with me of Value, and a considerable Sum
of Money, my Nephew furnishing me with a thousand Pieces of
Eight, and a Letter of Credit for more, if I had Occasion, that I might
not be straiten'd whatever might happen.
I quickly dispos'd of my Goods, and to Advantage too; and, as I
originally intended, I bought here some very good Diamonds, which,
of all other Things, was the most proper for me in my present Cir
cumstances, because I might always carry my whole Estate about me
After a long Stay here, and many Proposals made for my Return
to England, but none falling out to my Mind, the English Merchant
who lodged with me, and with whom I had contracted an intimate
Acquaintance, came to me one Morning: Countryman, says he, I
have a Project to communicate to you, which, as it suits with my
Thoughts, may for aught I know, suit with yours also, when you
shall have thoroughly consider'd it.
Here we are posted, says he, you by Accident, and I by my own
Choice, in a Part of the World very remote from our own Country;
but it is in a Country, where, by us who understand Trade and
Business, a great deal of Money is to be got: If you will put a
thousand Pound to my thousand Pound, we will hire a Ship here, the
first we can get to our Minds; you shall be Captain, I'll be Merchant,
and we will go a trading Voyage to China; for what should we
stand still for? The whole World is in motion, rolling round and
lound; all the Creatures of God, heavenly Bodies and earthly, are
busy and diligent, Why should we be idle? There are no Drones iu
the World but Men, Why should wc be of that Number?
I liked his Proposal very well, and the more, because it seemed to
be cxpress'd with so much good Will, and in so friendly a Manner:
I will not say, but that I might by my loose and unhing'd Circum-
stances be the fitter to embrace a Proposal for Trade, or indeed for
anything else; whereas, otherwise, Trade was none of my Element:
However, I might perhaps say with some Truth, that if Trade was
not my Element, Rambling was, and no Proposal for seeing any Part
of the World which I never had seen before, could possibly come
amiss to me.
It was however, some Time before we could get a Ship to our
Minds; and when we had got a Vessel, it was not easy to get
English Sailors; that is to say, so many as were necessary to govern
the Voyage, and manage the Sailors which we should pick up there.
After some Time we got a Mate, a Boatswain, and a Gunner English;
a Dutch Carpenter, and three Portuguese Foremast Men; with these
we found we could do well enough, having Indian Seamen, such as
they are, to make up.
There are so many Travellers, who have wrote the History of their
Voyages and Travels this Way, that it would be very little Diversion
to anybody, to give a long Account of the Places we went to, and the
People who inhabit there; those Things I leave to others, and refer
the Reader to those Journals and Travels of Englishmen, of which
many I find are publish'd, and more promis'd every Day; it is enough
to me to tell you, That I made this Voyage to Achin, in the Island ol
Sumatra, and from thence to Siam, where we exchang'd some of cir
Wares for Opium, and some Arrack, the first, a Commodity which
bears a great Price among the Chinese, and which at that Time, was
very much wanted there. In a Word, we went up to Suskan, made a
very great Voyagt; was eight Months out, and return'd to Bengal,
and I was very well satisfy'd with my Adventure: I observe that oui
People in England, often admire how the Officers which the Company
send into India, and the Merchants which generally stay there, get
such very great Estates as they do, and sometimes come home worth
60, 70 to 100 thousand Pound at a Time.
But it is no Wonder, or at least we shall see so much farther into
h, when we consider the innumerable Ports and Places where they
have a free Commerce; that it will then be no Wonder; and much
less will it be so, when we consider, that at all those Places and Pot *s
where the English Ships come, there is so much, and such constant
Demand for the Growth of all other Countries, that there is a certain
Vent for the Returns, as well as a Market abroad, for the Goods
carried out
In short, we made a very good Voyage, and I got so much Money
by the first Adventure, and such an Insight into the Method of
getting more, that had I been twenty Year younger, I should have
been tempted to have stayed here and sought no farther, for making
my Fortune; but what was all this, to a Man on the wrong Side of
threescore, that was rich enough, and came abroad, more in Obedi-
ence to a restless Desire of seeing the World, than a covetous Desire
of getting in it; and indeed I think, it is with great Justice, that I now
call it a restless Desire for it was so; when I was at Home, I was
restless to go abroad; and now I was abroad, I was restless to be at
Home: I say, what was this Gain to me? I was rich enough, nor
had I any uneasie Desires about getting more Money; and therefore
the Profits of the Voyage to me were Things of no great Force, for
the prompting me forward to farther Undertakings; and I thought
that by this Voyage I had made no Progress at all, because I was
come back as I might call it, to the Place from whence I came as
to a Home; whereas, my Eye, which like that which Solomon speaks
of, was never satisfied with Seeing, was still more desirous of Wandering
and Seeing; I was come into a Part of the World, which I was never
in before; and that Part in particular, which I had heard much of;
and was resolv'd to see as much of as I could, and then I thought, I
might say, I had seen all the World, that was worth seeing.
But my Fellow Traveller and I, had different Notions; I do not
name this, to insist upon my own, for I acknowledge his were the
most just and the most suited to the end of a Merchant's Life; who,
when he is abroad upon Adventures, it is his Wisdom to stick to that
as the best Thing for him, which he is like to get the most Money by:
My new Friend kept himself to the Nature of the Thing, and would
have been content to have gone like a Carrier's Horse, always to the
same Inn, backward and forward, provided he could, as he called it,
find his Account in it; on the other Hand, mine was the Notion of a
mad rambling Boy, that never cares to see a Thing twice over.
But this was not all; I had a Kind of Impatience upon me to be
nearer Home, and yet the most unsettled Resolution imaginable
which Way to go; in the Interval of these Consultations, my Friend,
who was always upon the Search for Business, propos'd another
Voyage to me among the Spice Islands, and to bring Home a Load-
ing of Cloves from the Manillas, or thereabouts; Places where
indeed the Dutch do trade, but Islands, belonging partly to the
Spaniards; though we went not so far, but to some other, where they
have not the whole Power, as they have at Batavia, Ceylon, &"C.
We were not long in preparing for this Voyage; the chief Difficulty was
in bringing me to come into it; however, at last nothing else offering,
and finding that really stirring about and trading, the Profit being
so great, and as I may say certain, had more Pleasure in it, and more
Satisfaction to the Mind than sitting still, which to me especially,
was the unhappiest Part of Life: I resolv'd on his Voyage too,
which we made very successfully, touching at Borneo, and several
Islands, whose Names I do not remember, and came Home in about
five Months; we sold our Spice, which was chiefly Cloves, and
some Nutmegs, to the Persian Merchants, who carry'd them away
for the Gulf: and making near five of one, we really got a great
deal of Money.
My Friend, when we made up this Account smiled at me; well
now, said he, with a Sort of agreeable insulting my indolent
Temper; is not this better than walking about here, like a Man oj
nothing to do, and spending our Time in staring at the Nonsense and
Ignorance of the Pagans? Why truly, says I, my Friend, I think it is;
and I begin to be a Convert to the Principles of Merchandising;
but I must tell you, said I, by the Way, you do not know what I am
a-doing, for if once I conquer my backwardness, and embark heartily;
as old as I am, I shall harass you up and down the World, till I
tire you; for I shall pursue it so eagerly, I shall never let you lie
still.
But to be short with my Speculations, a little while after this, there
came in a Dutch Ship from Batavia; she was a Coaster, not an
European Trader, and of about two hundred Ton Burden: The Men,
as they pretended, having been so sickly, that the Captain had not
Men enough to go to Sea with; he lay by at Bengal, and having it
seems got Money enough, or being willing for other Reasons, to go
for Europe, he gave public Notice, that he would sell his Ship: This
came to my Ears before my new Partner heard of it; and I had a
great Mind to buy it, so I goes Home to him, and told him of it
He considered awhile, for he was no rash Man neither; but musing
(ome Time, he reply'd, she is a little too big; but however, we wilJ
ADVENTURES OP
have her; accordingly we bought the Ship, and agreeing with the
Master, we paid for her, and took Possession; when we had done so,
we resolv'd to entertain the men if we could, to join them with those
we had, for the pursuing our Business; but on a sudden, they having
receiv'd not their Wages, but their Share of the Money, not one of
them was to be found; we inquir'd much about them, and at length
were told, that they were all gone together by Land to Agra, the
great City of the Mogul's Residence; and from thence were to travel
*o Surat, and so by Sea, to the Gulf of Persia.
Nothing had so heartily troubled me a good while; as that I missed
the Opportunity of going with them; for such a Ramble I thought,
and in such Company, as would both have guarded me and diverted
me, would have suited mightily with my great Design; and I should
oth have seen the World, and gone homewards too; but I was much
better satisfied a few Days after, when I came to know what sort of
Fellows they were; for in short their History was, that this Man they
called Captain was the Gunner only, not the Commander; that they
had been a trading Voyage, in which, they were attack'd on Shore, by
some of the Malayans, who had killed the Captain, and three of his
Men; and that after the Captain was killed, these Men, eleven in
Number, had resolv'd to run away with the Ship, which they did;
and brought her in at the Bay of Bengal, leaving the Mate and five
Men more on Shore, of whom, we shall hear farther.
Well, let them come by the Ship how they would, we came honestly
by her, as we thought, though we did not I confess, examine into
Things so exactly as we ought, for we never inquir'd anything
of the Seamen; who, if we had examin'd, would certainly have
falter'd in their Account, contradicted one another, and perhaps
contradicted themselves, or onehow or other, we should have
seen Reason to have suspected them; but the Man showed us a
Bill of Sale for the Ship, to one Emanuel Clostershoven, or some such
Name; for I suppose it was all a Forgery, and called himself by that
Name, and we could not contradict him; and being withal a little too
unwary, or at least, having no Suspicion of the Thing, we went
through with our Bargain.
We picked up some more English Seamen here after this, and some
Dutch; and now we resolv'd for a second Voyage, to the South East
for Cloves, cVv., that is to say, among the Philippine and Malacca
Isles; and in short, not to fill this Part of my Story with Trifles,
44'
when what is yet to come, is so remarkable; I spent from first to last
six Years in this Country, trading from Port to Port, backward and
forward, and with very good Success; and was now the last Year
with my new Partner, going in the Ship above-mention'd, on a Voyage
to China; but designing first to Siam, to buy Rice.
In this Voyage, being by contrary Winds oblig'd to beat up and
down a great while in the Straits of Malacca, and among the Islands;
we were no sooner got clear of those difficult Seas, but we found our
Ship had sprung a Leak, and we were not able by all our Industry to
find it out where it was. This forced us to make for some Port, and
my Partner, who knew the Country better than I did, directed
the Captain to put into the River of Cambodia, for I had made the
English Mate, one Mr. Thomson, Captain, not being willing to take
the Charge of the Ship upon myself: This River lies on the North
Side of the great Bay or Gulf, which goes up to Siam.
While we were here, and going often on Shore for Refreshment,
there comes to me one Day
an Englishman, and he was it
seems, a Gunner's Mate, on
board an English East-India
Ship, which rode in the same
River, up at, or near the City
of Cambodia; what brought
him hither we know not; but
he comes up to me, and
speaking English: Sir, says
he, you are a Stranger to me,
and I to you; but I have some-
thing to tell you,that very nearly —-=^^-^_ * *9
concerns you.
I looked steadily at him a good while, and thought at first I had
known him, but I did not; if it very nearly concerns me, said I,
and not yourself, what moves you to tell it me? I am moved, says
he, by the imminent Danger you are in, and for aught I see, you have
no Knowledge of it; I know no Danger I am in, said I, but that my
Ship is leaky, and I cannot find it out; but I purpose to lay her
a-Ground to-Morrow, to see if I can find it; but Sir, says he, leaky,
or not leaky, find it, or not find it, you will be wiser than to lay
your Ship on Shore to-Morrow, when you hear what I have to say to

you; do you know Sir, said he, the Town of Cambottia lies about
fifteen Leagues up this River? And there are two large English
Ships about five Leagues on this side, and three Dutch; well, saidi;
and what is that to me? Why Sir, said he, is it for a Man that is
upon such Adventures as you are upon, to come into a Port, and not
examine first what Ships there are there, and whether he is able to deal
with them? I suppose you do not think you are a Match for them: I
was amus'd very much at his Discourse, but not amaz'd at it, for I
could not conceive what he meant; and I turned short upon him and
said, Sir, I wish you would explain yourself; I cannot imagine what
Reason I have to be afraid of any Company of Ships, or Dutch Ships;
I am no Interloper, what can they have to say to me?
He looked like a Man half'angry, half pleased, and pausing awhile,
but smiling ; well, Sir, says he, if you think yourself secure, you must
take your Chance; I am sorry your Fate should blind you against
good Advice; but assure yourself, if you do not put to Sea imme-
diately, you will the very next Tide be attack'd by five Long-Boats
full of Men, and perhaps if you are taken, you'll be hanged for a
Pirate, and the Particulars be examin'd afterwards: I thought, Sir,
added he, I should have met with a better Reception than this, foi
doing you a Piece of Service of such Importance: I can never be
ungrateful, said I, for any Service, or to any Man that offers me any
Kindness, but it is past my Comprehension, said I, what they
should have such a Design upon me for; however, since you
say, there is no Time to be lost, and that there is some villanous
Design in Hand against me; I'll go on board this Minute, and put
to sea immediately, if my Men can stop the Leak, or if we
can swim without stopping it But, Sir, said I, shall I go away
ignorant of the Reason of all this? Can you give me no farther
Light into it?
I can tell you but Part of the Story, Sir, says he, but I have a Dutch
Seaman here with me, and I believe I could persuade him to tell you
the rest; but there is scarce Time for it But the Short of the Story
is this, the first Part of which, I suppose, you know well enough, (viz.)
that you was with this Ship at Sumatra, that there your Captain was
murder'd by the Malayans, with three of his Men, and that you ot
some of those who were on board with you, ran away with the Ship,
and are since turned PIRA TES; this is the Sum of the Story, and you
will be all seized as Pirates I can assure you, and executed, with very
Bttlt Ceremony; for you know, Merchants' Ships show bu< little
Law to Pirates, if they get them into their Power.
Now you speak plain English, said I, and I thank you; and though
I know nothing, that we have done, like what you talk of, but am sure"
we came honestly and fairly by the Ship, yet seeing such Work is
a-doing as you say, and that you seem to mean honestly, I'll be upon
my Guard. Nay, Sir, says he, do not talk of being upon your guard;
the best Defence, is to be out of the Danger, if you have any Regard
to your Life, and the Lives of all your Men; put out to Sea without
fail at High Water, and as you have a whole Tide before you, you
will be gone too far out before they can come down, for they came
away at High Water; and as they have twenty Miles to come, you
get near two Hours of them, by the Difference of the Tide, not
reckoning the Length of the Way; besides, as they are only Boats,
and not Ships, they will not venture to follow you far out to Sea,
especially if it blows.
Well, says I, you have been very kind in this, what shall I do for
you, to make you amends? Sir, says he, you may not be so willing
to make me any amends, because you may not be convinc'd of the
Truth of it: I'll make an Offer to you; I have nineteen Months'
Pay due to me, on board the Ship ^—^— which I came out oi
England in, and the Dutchman that is with me has seven Months'
Pay due to him; if you will make good our Pay to us, we will go
along with you; if you find nothing more in it, we will desire no more;
but if we do convince you, that we have saved your Lives, and the
Ship, and the Lives of all the Men in her, we will leave the rest to
fou.
I consented to this readily, and went immediately on board, and
the two Men with me; as soon as I came to the Ship Side, my
Partner who was on Board, came out on the Quarter-Deck, and
called to me with a great deal of Joy, O hoi O ho I we have stopped
the leak I we have stopped the leak I Say you so, said I, thank God;
but weigh the Anchor then immediately; weigh! says he, what do you
mean by that? What is the Matter ? says he. Ask no Questions,
tays I, but all Hands to work, and weigh, without losing a Minute(
he was surpris'd, but however, he called the Captain, and he imme«
diately ordered the Anchor to be got up; and though the Tide was
not quite done, yet a little Land Breeze blowing, we stood out to Sea;
then I called him into the Cabin, and told him the Story at large*
and we called in the Men, and they told us the rest of it; but as it
took us up a great deal of Time, so before we had done, a Seaman
comes to the Cabin Door, and calls out to us, that the Captain bad
him tell us, we were chased; chased, says I, by who, and by what?
By five Sloops or Boats, says the Fellow, full of Men; very well, said
/, then it is apparent there is something in it; in the next Place I
order'd all our Men to be called up, and told them, that there was a
Design to Seize the Ship, and to take us for Pirates, and asked them,
if they would stand by us, and by one another; the Men answer'd
cheerfully, that one and all, they would live and die with us: Then I
asked the Captain, what Way he thought best for us to manage a
Fight with them; for resist them I was resolv'd we would, and that,
to the last Drop; he said readily, That the Way was to keep them
off with our great Shot, as long as we could, and then to fire at
them with our small Arms as long as we could; but when neither
of these would do any longer, we should retire to our close Quarters \
perhaps they had not Materials to break open our Bulk-Heads, or
get in upon us.
The Gunner had in the meantime, Order to bring two Guns to
bear fore and aft out of the Steerage, to clear the Deck, and load them
with Musket-Bullets and small Pieces of old Iron, and what next
came to Hand, and thus we made ready for Fight; but all this while
we kept out to Sea, with Wind enough; and could see the Boats at a
Distance, being five large Lorg-Boats, following us with all the sail
they could make.
Two of those Boats, which by our Glasses we could see were
English, out-sailed the rest, were near two Leagues a-Head of
them, and gained upon us considerably; so that we found they would
come up with us; upon which, we fired a Gun without Ball, to inti-
mate, that they should bring to, and we put out a Flag of Truce; as a
Signal for Parley, but they kept crowding after us, till they came
within Shot: When we took in our White Flag, they having made no
Answer to it, hung out a red Flag, and fired at them with a Shot:
Notwithstanding this, they came on, till they were near enough to call
to them with a speaking Trumpet, which we had on Board; so we
tailed to them, and bid them keep off at their Peril
.
It was all one, they crowded after us, and endeavoured to come
under our Stern, so to board us on our Quarter; upon which, seeing
they were resolute for Mischief, and depended upon the Strength that
followed them, I ordered to bring the Ship to, so that they lay upon
our Broadside, when immediately we fired five Guns at them; one of
which had been levelled so true, as to carry away the Stern of the
hindermost Boat, and bring them to the Necessity of taking down
their Sail, and running all to the Head of the Boat to keep her from
sinking; so she lay by, and had enough of it; but seeing the foremost
Boat crowd on after us, we made ready to fire at her in particular.
While this was doing, one of the three Boats that was behind,
being forwarder than the other two, made up to the Boat which we
had disabled, to relieve her, and we could afterwards see her take out
the Men; we called again to the foremost Boat, and offer'd a Truce
to parley again, and to know what was her Business with us; but had
no Answer, only she crowded close under our Ster n; upon this our
Gunner, who was a very dexterous Fellow, run out his two Chase-Guns
and fired again at her; but the shot missing, the Men in the Boat
shouted, waved their Caps, and came on; but the Gunner getting
quickly ready again, fired among them the second Time; one Shot 0/
which, though it missed the Boat itself, yet fell in among the Men, and
we could easily see, had done a great deal of Mischief among them;
but we taking no Notice of that, wared the Ship again, and brought
our Quarter to bear upon them; and firing three Guns more, we found
the Boat was split almost to Pieces; in particular, her Rudder, and
a Piece of her Stern was shot quite away, so they handed their Sail
immediately, and were in great Disorder; but to complete their mis-
fortune, our Gunner let fly two Guns at them again; where he hit
them we could not tell, but we found the Boat was sinking, and some
of the Men already in the Water; upon this, I immediately Manned
out our Pinnace, which we had kept close by our Side, with Orders
to pick up some of the Men if they could, and save them from drown-
ing, and immediately to come on board with them; because we saw
the rest of the Boats began to come up; our Men in the Pinnace
followed their Orders, and took up three Men; one of which was
just drowning, and it was a good while before we could recover him;
as soon as they were on Board, we crowded all the Sail we could
make, and stood farther out to Sea, and we found that when the other
three Boats came up to the first two, they gave over their Chase.
Being thus deliver'd from a Danger, which though I knew not the
Reason of it, yet seemed to be much greater than I apprehended; 1
took Care that we would change our Course, and not let anv one
imagine whither we were going; so we stood out to Sea Eastward,
quite out of the Course of all European Ships, whether they were
bound to China, or anywhere else, within the Commerce of the
European Nations
When we were now at Sea, we began to consult with the two Sea-
men, and inquire first what the Meaning of all this should be, and
the Dutchman let us into the Secret of it at once; telling us that the
Fellow that sold us the Ship, as we said, was no more than a Thief,
that had run away with her: Then he told us, how the Captain,
whose Name too he told us, though I do not remember, was treache-
rously murdered by the Natives on the Coast of Malacca, with three
of his Men; and that he, this Dutchman, and four more, got into
the Woods, where they wandered about a great while; till at length,
he in particular, in a miraculous Manner made his Escape, and swam
off to a Dutch Ship, which sailing near the Shore, in its way from
China, had sent their Boat on Shore for fresh Water; that he durst
not come to that Part of the Shore where the Boat was, but
shift in the Night, to take the Water farther off, and the Ship's Boat
took him up.
He then told us, that he went to Batavia, where two of the Sea-
men belonging to the Ship arriv'd, having deserted the rest in theii
Travels, and gave an Account, that the Fellow who had run away
with the Ship, sold her at Bengal, to a Set of Pirates, which were gone
a Cruising in her; and that they had already taken an English Ship,
and two Dutch Ships very richly laden.
This latter Part we found to concern us directly, and though we
knew it to be false; yet as my Partner said very well, if we had fallen
into their Hands, and they had had such a Prepossession against us
beforehand, it had been in vain for us to have defended ourselves,
or to hope for any good Quarter at their Hands, and especially con-
sidering that our Accusers had been our Judges, and that we could
have expected nothing from them, but what Rage would have dic-
tated, and an ungovern'd Passion have executed; and therefore it
was his Opinion, we should go directly back to Bengal, from whence
we came, without putting in at any Port whatever; because there
we could give a good Account of ourselves, could prove where
we were when the Ship put in, who we bought her of, and the
like; and which was more than all the rest, if we were put to
the Necessity of bringing it before the proper Judges, we should
be sure to have some Justice, and not be hanged first, and Judged
afterwards.
I was sometime of my Partner's Opinion; but after a little more
serious thinking, I told him, I thought it was a very great Hazard for
us to attempt returning to Bengal, for that we were on the wrong Side
of the Straits of Malacca; and that if the Alarm was given, we should
be sure to be Waylaid on every Side, as well by the Dutch of Batavia,
as the English elsewhere; that if we should be taken, as it were,
running away, we should even condemn ourselves, and there would
want no more Evidence to destroy us; I also asked the English
Sailor's Opinion, who said, he was of my Mind, and that we should
certainly he taken.
This Danger a little startled my Partner and all the Ship's Com-
pany; and we immediately resolv'd to go away to the Coast of Ton-
quin, and so on to the Coast of China, and pursuing the first Design
as to Trade, find some Way or other to dispose of the Ship, and come
back in some of the Vessels of the Country, such as we could get:
This was approv'd of as th» best Method for our Security; and ac-
cordingly we steered away N.N.E., keeping above fifty Leagues off
from the usual Course to the Eastward.
This however put us to some Inconveniences; for first the Winds,
when we came to the Distance from the Shore, seemed to be more
steadily against us, blowing almost Trade, as we call it, from the East,
and E.N.E. so that we were a long while upon our Voyage, and we were
but ill provided with Victuals for so long a Voyage; and which was still
worse, there was some Danger that those English and Dutch Ships, whose
Boats pursu'd us, whereof some were bound that Way, might be got in
before us, and if not, some other Ship, bound to China, might have
Information of us from them, and pursue us with the same Vigour.
I must confess I was now very uneasy, and thought myself, in-
cluding the late Escape from the Long-Boats, to have been in the
most dangerous Condition that ever I was in through all my past Life;
or whatever ill Circumstances I had been in, I was never pursu'd for
a Thief before; nor had I ever done anything that merited the
Name of Dishonest or Fraudulent, much less Thievish. I had chiefly
been my own Enemy, or as I may rightly say, I had been nobody's
Enemy but my own: But now I was embarrass'd in the worst Con
dition imaginable; for though I was perfectly innocent, I was in no
Condition to make that Innocence appear: And if I had been taken,
it had been under a suppos'd Guilt of the worst Kind; at least, 8
Crime esteem'd so among the People I had to do with.
This made me very anxious to make an Escape, though, which
Way to do it, I knew not, or what Port or Place we should go to: My
Partner seeing me thus dejected, though he was the most concern'd
at first, began to encourage me; and describing to me the several
Ports of that Coast, told me he would put in on the Coast of Cochin-
china, or the Bay of Tonquin, intending to go afterwards to Macao, a
Town once in the Possession of the Portuguese, and where still a great
many European Families resided, and particularly the Missionary
Priests usually went thither, in order to their going forward to China.
Hither then we resolv'd to go; and accordingly, though after a
tedious and irregular Course, and very much straitened for Provisions,
we came within Sight of the Coast very early in the Morning; and
upon Reflection upon the past Circumstances we were in, and the
Danger if we had not escap'd, we resolv'd to put into a small River,
which however had a Depth enough of Water for us, and to see if we
could, either over Land, or by the Ship's Pinnace, come to know
what Ships were in any Port thereabouts. This happy Step was
indeed our Deliverance; for though we did not immediately see any
European Ships in the Bay of Tonquin, yet the next Morning there
came into the Bay two Dutch Ships, and a third without any Colours
spread out, but which we believ'd to be a Dutchman passed by at
about two Leagues' Distance, steering for the Coast of China; and
in the Afternoon went by two English Ships steering the same Course;
and thus, we thought, we saw ourselves beset with Enemies, both one
Way or other. The Place we were in was wild and barbarous, the
People Thieves, even by Occupation or Profession; and though it is
true we had not much to seek of them, and except getting a few Pro-
visions, cared not how little we had to do with them, yet it was with
much Difficulty that we kept ourselves from being insulted by them
several Ways.
We were in a small River of this Country, within a few Leagues of
its utmost Limits Northward; and by our Boat we coasted North-East
to the Point of Land, which opens the great Bay of Tonquin; and it
was in this beating up along the Shore, that we discover'd, as above,
that in a Word, we were surrounded with Enemies. The People we
were among, were the most barbarous of all the Inhabitants of the
Coast; having no Correspondence with any other Nation, and dealing
only in Fish, and Oil, and such Gross Commodities; and it may be
particularly seen, that they are, as I said, the most barbarous of any
of the Inhabitants, (viz.) that among other Customs they have this as
one, (viz.) That if any Vessel have the Misfortune to be shipwreck'd
upon their Coast, they presently make their Men all Prisoners or
Slaves; and it was not long before we found a spice of their Kindness
this Way, on the Occasion following.
I have obseiVd above, that our Ship sprung a Leak at Sea, and
that we could not find it out; and however, it happen'd, that as I
have said, it was stopped unexpectedly in the happy Minute of our
being to be seized by the Dutch and English Ships in the Bay of
Siam; yet as we did not find the Ship so perfectly fit and sound as
we desir'd, we resolv'd, while we were in this Place, to lay her on
Shore, take out what heavy Things we had on Board, which were not
many, and to wash and clean her Bottom, and, if possible, to find
out where the Leaks were.
Accordingly, having lighten'd the Ship, and brought all our Gunj
and other moveable Things to one Side, we tried to bring her down,
that we might come at her Bottom; but on second Thoughts we did
net care to lay her dry on Ground, neither could we find out a proper
Place for it
The Inhabitants, who had never been acquainted with such a
Sight, came wondering down to the Shore, to look at us; and seeing
the Ship lie down on one side in such a manner, and heeling in
towards the Shore, and not seeing our Men, who were at Work on her
Bottom, with Stages and with their Boats on the off-side, they pre*
sently concluded that the Ship was cast away, and lay so fast on the
Ground.
On this Supposition they came all about us in two or three Hours'
time, with ten or twelve large Boats, having some of them eight,
some ten Men in a Boat, intending, no doubt, to have come on Board,
and plunder'd the Ship; and if they had found us there, to have
carry'd us away for Slaves to their King, or whatever they call him;
for we knew nothing who was their Governor.
When they came up to the Ship, and began to row round her, they
discover'd us all hard at Work on the Outside of the Ship's bottom
and side, washing, and graving, and stopping, as every Seafaring Man
knows how.
They stood for a while gazing at us, and we, who were a little sur-
pris'd, codid not imagine what their Design was; but, being willing to
be sure, we took this Opportunity to get some of us into the Ship, and
others to hand down Arms and Ammunition to those that were at
Work, to defend themselves with, if there should be Occasion; and it
was no more that Need; for in less than a quarter of an Hour's Con-
sultation, they agreed, it seems, that the Ship was really a Wreck, that
we were all at Work endeavouring to save her, or to save our Lives
by the Help of our Boats; and when we handed our Arms into the
Boats, they concluded, by that motion, that we were endeavouring to
save some of our Goods; upon this they took it for granted we all
belong'd to them; and away they came down upon our Men, as if it
had been in a Line of Battle.
Our Men, seeing so many of them, began to be frighted; for we
lay but in an ill Posture to fight, and cried out to us to know what
they should do: I immediately called to the Men who worked upon
the Stages, to slip them down, and get up the side into the Ship; and
bade those in the Boat to row round and come on board; and those
few of us, who were on board, worked with all the strength and
hands we had, to bring the Ship to Rights; but however, neither
the Men upon the Stages or those in the Boats, could do as they were
order'd, before the Cochinchineses were upon them; and two of their
Boats boarded our Long-Boat, and began to lay hold of the Men as
their Prisoners.
The first Man they laid hold of was an English Seaman, a stout
strong Fellow, who having a Musket in his Hand, never offer'd to fire
it, but laid it down in the Boat, like a Fool, as I thought: but he
understood his Business better than I could teach him; for he grappled
the Pagan, and dragged him by main Force out of their own Boat into
ours; where, taking him by the two Ears, he beat his Head so against
the Boat's Gunnel, that the Fellow died instantly in his Hands; and
in the meantime, a Dutchman, who stood next, took up the Musket,
and with the Butt-end of it, so laid about him, that he knock'd down
five of them, who attempted to enter the Boat But this was doing
little towards resisting thirty or forty Men, who fearless, because
ignorant of their Danger, began to throw themselves into the Long-
Boat, where we had but five Men in all to defend it: But one
Accident gave our Men a complete Victory, which deserv'd our
Laughter rather than anything else, and that was this:
Our Carpenter being preparing to yave the Outside of the Ship,
as well as to pay the Seams, where he had caulked her to stop the
Leaks, had got two Kettles just let down into the Boat; one filled
with boiling Pitch, and the other with Rosin, Tallow, and Oil, and
such Stuff as the Shipwrights use for that Work; and the MaD
that tended the Carpenter had a great Iron Ladle in his Hand,
with which he supply'd the Men that were at Work with that hot
Stuff; two of the Enemy's Men entered the Boat just where this
Fellow stood, being in the Fore-sheets; he immediately saluted them
with a Ladle full of the Stuff, boiling hot, which so burnt and scalded
them, being half naked, that they roared out like two Bulls, and,
enrag'd with the Fire, leaped both into the Sea: The Carpenter saw
it, and cried out, Well done, Jack, give them some more of it; and
stepping forward himself, takes one of their Mops, and dipping it in
the Pitch-Pot, he and his Man threw it among them so plentifully
that, in short, of all the Men in three Boats, there was not one
that was not scalded and burnt with it in a most frightful pitiful
Manner, and made such a Howling and Crying, that I never heard a
worse Noise, and indeed nothing like it; for it is worth observing,
That though Pain naturally makes all People cry out, yet every
Nation has a particular Way of Exclamation, and make Noises as
different from one another as their Speech; I cannot give the Noise
these Creatures made a better Name than Howling, nor a Name
more proper to the Tone of it; for I never heard anything more
like the Noise of the Wolves, which as I have said, I heard howl in
the Forest on the Frontiers of Languedoc.
I was never pleased with a Victory better in my Life; not only as
it was a perfect Surprise to me, and that our Danger was imminent
before: But as we got this Victory without any Bloodshed, except of
that Man the Fellow killed with his naked Hands, and which I was
very much concern'd at; for I was sick of killing such poor savage
Wretches, even though it was in my own Defence, knowing they came
on Errands which they thought just, and knew no better; end that
though it may be a just Thing, because necessary, for there is no
necessary Wickedness in Nature, yet I thought it was a sad Life,
which we must be always oblig'd to be killing our Fellow-Creatures
to preserve our own, and indeed I think so still; and I would
even now suffer a great deal, rather than I would take away the
Life, even of that Person injuring me: And I believe, all con-
sidering People, who know the Value of Life, vould be of my
Opinion, at least, they would, if they entered seriously into the Con-
sideration of it
But to return to my Story. All the while this was doing, my Partnei
ind I, who manag'd the rest of the Men on Board, had with great
Dexterity brought the Ship almost to Rights; and having gotten the
Guns into their Places again, the Gunner called to me to bid our
Boat get out of the Way, for he would let fly among them. I called
back again to him, and bid him not offer to fire, for the Carpenter
would do the Work without him, but bade him heat another Pitch-
Kettle, which our Cook, who was on Board, took Care of: But the
Enemy were so terrify'd with what they had met with in their first
Attack, that they would not come on again; and some of them
that were farthest off, seeing the Ship swim, as it were upright, begun,
as we supposed, to see their Mistake, and give over the Enterprise,
finding it was not as they expected. Thus we got clear of this merry
Fight; and having gotten some Rice, and some Roots, and Bread,
with about sixteen good big Hogs on Board, two Days before, we re-
solv'd to stay here no longer, but go forward whatever came of it; for
we made no Doubt but we should be surrounded the next Day with
Rogues enough, perhaps more than our Pitch-Kettle would dispose of
for us.
We therefore got all our Things on Board the same Evening, and
the next Morning were ready to sail; in the meantime, lying at an
Anchor at some Distance, we were not so much concern'd, being now
in a fighting Posture, as well as in a sailing Posture, if any Enemy had
presented: The next Day having finish'd our Work within Board,
and finding our Ship was perfectly healed of all her Leaks, we set
Sail. We would have gone into the Bay of Tonquin; for we wanted
to inform ourselves of what was to be known concerning the Dutch
Ships that had been there; but we durst not stand in there, because
we had seen several Ships go in, as we suppos'd, but a little before;
so we kept on N.E. towards the Isle of Formosa, as much afraid of
being seen by a Dutch or English Merchant Ship, as a Dutch or
English Merchant Ship in the Mediterranean is of an Algerine Man of
War.
When we were thus got to Sea, we kept out N.E. as if we would
go to the Manillas or the Philippine Islands; and this we did, that
we might not fall into the Way of any of our European Ships; and
then we steered North till we came to the Latitude of »a Degrees,
30 Min.; by which means we made the Island Formosa directly,
where we came to an Anchor, in order to get Water and fresh Pro-
visions, which the People there, who are very courteous and civil in
their Manners, supplied us with willingly, and dealt very fairly and
punctually with us in all their Agreements and Bargains; which is
what we did not find among other People; and may be owing to the
Remains of Christianity, which was once planted here by a Dutch
Missionary of Protestants, and is a Testimony of what I have often
observ'd, viz. That the Christian Religion always civilizes the People,
and reforms their Manners, where it is receiv'd, whether it works
saving Effects upon them or no.
From hence we sailed still North, keeping the Coast of China at
an equal Distance, till we knew we were beyond all the Ports of
China, where our European Ships usually come; being resolv'd, if
possible, not to fall into any of their Hands, especially in this
Country, where, as our Circumstances were, we could not fail of being
entirely ruined; nay, so great was my Fear in particular, as to my
being taken by them, that I believe firmly, I would much rather have
chosen to fall into the Hands of the Spanish Inquisition.
Being now come to the Latitude of 30 Degrees, we resolv'd to put
into the first trading Port we should come at; and standing in for the
Shore, a Boat came off two Leagues to us, with an old Portuguese
Pilot on Board, who knowing us to be an European Ship, came to
offer his Service, which indeed we were very glad of, and took him
on Board; upon which, without asking us whither we would go, he
dismiss'd the Boat he came in, and sent them back.
I thought it was now so much in our Choice, to make the old Man
carry us whither we would; that I began to talk with him about car-
rying us to the Gulf of Nankin, which is the most Northern Part
of the Coast of China: The old Man said he knew the Gulf of
Nankin very well; but smiling, asked us what we would do there?
I told him, we would sell our Cargo, and purchase China-Waxes,
Calicoes, Raw-Silks, Tea, Wrought-Silks, Grc, and so would return
by the same Course we came: He told us our best Port had been to
have put in at Macao, where we could not have failed of a Market for
our Opium, to our Satisfaction, and might for our Money have pur-
chas'd all Sorts of China-Goods, as cheap as we could at Nankin.
Not being able to put the old Man out of his Talk, of which he
was very opiniated or conceited, I told him, we were Gentlemen, as
well as Merchants, and that we had a Mind to go and see the great
City of Pekin, and the famous Court of the Monarch of China.
Why then, says the old Man, you should go to Ningpo, where, by the
River which runs into the Sea there, you may go up within five
Leagues of the Great Canal. This Canal is a navigable River, which
goes through the Heart of that vast Empire of China, crosses all
the Rivers, passes some considerable Hills by the Help of Sluices and
Gates, and goes up to the City of Pekin, being in Length near
370 Leagues.
Well, said I, Seignior Portuguese, but that is not our Business now:
The great Question is, If you can carry us up to the City of Nankin,
from whence we can travel to Pekin afterwards? Yes, he said, he
could do so very well, and that there was a great Dutch Ship gone up
that Way just before. This gave me a little Shock; and a Dutch Ship
was now our Terror, and we had much rather have met the Devil, at
least, if he had not come in too frightful a Figure; and we depended
upon it, that a Dutch Ship would be our Destruction, for we were in
no Condition to fight them; all the Ships they trade with into those
Parts being of great Burden, and of much greater Force than we were.
The old Man found me a little confus'd, and under some Concern,
when he named a Dutch Ship, and said to me, Sir, you need be under
no Apprehensions of the Dutch, I suppose they are not now at War
with your Nation: No, says I, that's true; but I know not what
Liberties Men may take when they are out of the Reach of the Law:
Why, says he, you are no Pirates, what need you fear? They will not
meddle with peaceable Merchants sure.
If I had any Blood in my Body that did not fly up into my Face
at that Word, it was hinder'd by some Stop in the Vessels, appointed
by Nature to prevent it; for it put me into the greatest Disorder and
Confusion imaginable: Nor was it possible for me to conceal it so,
but that the old Man easily perceiv'd it
Sir, says he, I find you are in some Disorder in your Thoughts at
my Talk, pray be pleased to go which Way you think fit, and depend
upon it, I'll do you all the Service I can. Why, Seignior, said I, it if
true I am a little unsettled in my Resolution at this Time whither to
go in particular; and I am something more so, for what you said
about Pirates, I hope there are no Pirates in these Seas; we are but
in an ill Condition to meet with them, for you see we have but a
small Force, and but very weakly Manned.
0 Sii, says he, do not be concera'd, I do not know that there has
been any Pirates in these Seas these fifteen Years, except one which
was seen, as I hear, in the Bay of Siam, about a Month since; but
you may be assur'd she is gone to the Southward; nor was she a Ship
of any great Force, or fit for the Work; she was not built for a Priva-
teer, but was run away with by a reprobate Crew that were on Board,
after the Captain and some of his Men had been murder'd by the
Malayans, at or near the Island of Sumatra.
What! said I, seeming to know nothing of the Matter, did they
murder the Captain? No, said he, I do not understand that they
murder'd him; but as they afterwards run away with the Ship, it is
generally believ'd they betray'd him into the Hands of the Malayans,
who did murder him, and perhaps they procur'd them to do it
Why then, said I, they deserve Death as much as if they had done it
themselves. Nay, says the old Man, they do deserve it, and they will
certainly have it, if they light upon any English or Dutch Ship; for
they have all agreed together, that if they meet that Rogue, they will
give him no Quarter.
But, said I to him, you say the Pirate is gone out of those Seas.
How can they meet with him? Why, that is true, says he, they do say
so; but he was, as I tell you, in the Bay of Siam, in the River Cam-
bodia, and was discover'd there by some Dutchmen who belong'd to
the Ship, and who were left on Shore when they run away with her;
And some English and Dutch Traders being in the River, they were
within a little of taking him: Nay, said he, if the foremost Boats had
been well seconded by the rest, they had certainly taken him; but
he finding only two Boats within reach of him, tacked about, and fired
at these two, and disabled them before the other came up, and then
standing off to Sea, the other were not able to follow him, and so he
fcot away: But they have all so exact a Description of the Ship, that
they will be sure to know him; and wherever they find him, they have
vowed to give no Quarter, to either the Captain, or the Seamen, but
to hang them all up at the Yard-Arm.
What! says I, will they execute them right or wrong; hang them
first, and judge them afterwards? O Sir! says the old Pilot, there's
00 Need to make a formal Business of it with such Rogues as those,
let them tie them Back to Back, and set them a diving; it is no
more than they richly deserve.
1 knew I had my old Man fast aboard, and that he could do me

no Hanr 30 that I turned short upon him: Well now, Seignior, said
I, and this is the very Reason why I would have you carry us up to
Nankin, and not to put back to Macao, or to any other part of the
Country, where the English or
Dutch Ships come; for be it
known to you, Seignior, those
Captains of the English and
Dutch Ships are a Parcel of
rash, proud, insolent Fellows,
that neither know what belongs
to Justice, nor how to behave
themselves, as the Laws of God
and Nature direct; but being
proud of their Offices, and not
understanding their Power, they
would act the Murderers to
punish Robbers; would take
upon them to insult Men falsely
accus'd, and determine them guilty without due Inquiry; and perhaps
I may live to call some of them to an Account for it, where they may
be taught how Justice is to be executed, and that no Man ought to
be treated as a Criminal, till some Evidence may be had of the
Crime, and that he is the Man.
With this I told him, that this was the very Ship they attack'd,
and gave him a full Account of the Skirmish we had with their Boats,
and how foolishly and coward-like they behav'd. I told him all the
Story of our buying the Ship, and how the Dutchmen served us. I
told him the Reasons I had to believe that this Story of killing the
Master by the Malayans was true; as also the running away with
the Ship; but that it was all a Fiction of their own, to suggest that
the Men were turned Pirates; and they ought to have been sure it was
so, before they had ventur'd to attack us by Surprise, and oblige us
to resist them; adding that they would have the Blood of those Men,
who we killed there in our just Defence, to arrwer for.
The old Man was amaz'd at this Relation, and told us, we were
very much in the Right to go away to the North, and that if he might
advise us, it should be to sell the Ship in China, which we might
very well do, and buy or build another in the Country; and, said he,
though you will not get so good a Ship, yet you may get one able
enough to carry you and all your Goods back again to Bengal, or any-
where else.
I told him, I would take his Advice, when I came to any Port
where I could find a Ship for my Turn, or get any Customer
to buy this: He reply'd, I should meet with Customers enough for
the Ship at Nankin, and that a Chinese Junk would serve me very
well to go back again; and that he would procure me People, both to
buy one and sell the other.
Well, but Seignior, says I, as you say they know the Ship so well,
I may perhaps, if I follow your Measures, be instrumental to bring
some honest innocent Men into a terrible Broil, and perhaps to be
murder'd in cold Blood; for wherever they find the Ship, they will
prove the Guilt upon the Men, by proving this was the Ship, and so
innocent Men may probably be overpower'd and murder'd: Why,
says the old Man, I will find out a Way to prevent that also; for as I
know all those Commanders you speak of very well, and shall so:
them all as they pass by, I will be sure to set them to Rights in the
Thing, and let them know that they had been so much in the Wrong;
that though the People, who were on board at first, might run away
with the Ship, yet it was not true that they had turned Pirates; and that
in particular, these were not the Men that first went off with the SI- p,
but innocently bought her for their Trade; and I am persuaded they
will so far believe me, as at least to act more cautiously for the Time to
come. Well, says I, And will you deliver one Message to them from
me? Yes, I will, says he, if you will give it under your Hand in Writing,
that I may be able to prove that it came from you, and not out of
my own Head. I answer'd, That I would readily give it him under
tny Hand; so I took a Pen, and Ink, and Paper, and wrote at large
the Story of assaulting me with the Long-Boats, Gre., the pretended
Reason of it, and the unjust cruel Design of it; and concluded to the
Commanders, that they had done what they not only should have
been asham'd of, but also, that if ever they came to England, and
I lived to see them there, they should all pay dearly for it, if the
Laws of my Country were not grown out of Use before I arriv'd
there.
My old Pilot read this over and over again, and asked me several
Times if I would stand to it? I answer'd, I would stand to it as long
as I had anything left in the World, being sensible that I should
one Time or other find an Opportunity to put it home to them: But
we had no Occasion ever to let the Pilot carry this Letter; for he
never went back again: While those things were passing between us,
by Way of Discourse, we went forward, directly for Nankin, and in
about thirteen Days' Sail came to an Anchor at the South-West Point
of the great Gulf of Nankin, where, by the Way, I came by Acci-
dent to understand, that two Dutch Ships were gone the Length before
me, and that I should certainly fall into their Hands; I consulted
my Partner again in this Exigency, and he was as much at a Loss as
I was, and would very gladly have been safe on Shore almost any-
where; however, I was not in such Perplexity neither, but I
asked the old Pilot, if there was no Creek or Harbour, which I might
put into, and pursue my Business with the Chinese privately, and be
in no Danger of the Enemy: he told me, if I would sail to the
Southward about two and forty Leagues, there was a little Port called
Quinchang, where the Fathers of the Mission usually landed from
Macao, on their Progress to teach the Christian Religion to the
Chinese, and where no European Ships ever put in; and if I thought
to put in there, I might consider what farther Course to take when I
was on Shore: He confess'd, he said, it was not a Place for Merchants,
except that at some certain Times, they had a Kind of a Fair there,
when the Merchants from Japan came over thither to buy the Chinese
Merchandizes.
We all agreed to go back to this Place; the name of the Port, as he
called it, I may perhaps spell wrong; for I do not particularly remember
it, having lost this, together with the Names of many other Places,
set down in a little Pocket-Book, which was spoiled by the Water,
on an Accident, which I shall relate in its Order; but this I re-
member, that the Chinese, or Japanese Merchants we corresponded
with, called it by a differing Name from that which our Portuguese
Pilot gave it, and pronounc'd it as above, Quinchang.
As we were unanimous in our Resolutions to go to this Place, we
weighed the next Day, having only gone twice on Shore, where we were
to get fresh Water; on both which Occasions, the People of the
Country were very civil to us, and brought us Abundance of Things
to sell to us; I mean, of Provisions, Plants, Roots, Tea, Rice, and
some Fowls; but nothing without Money.
We came to the other Port, (the Wind being contrary) not till five
Days, but it was very much to our Satisfaction; and I was joyful, and I
may say, thankful, when I set my Foot safe on Shore; resolving, and
my Partner too, that if it was possible to dispose of ourselves and
Effects, any other Way, though not every Way to our Satisfaction, we
would never set one Foot on Board that unhappy Vessel more; and
indeed I must acknowledge, that of all the Circumstances of Life,
that ever I had any Experience of, nothing makes Mankind so com-
pletely miserable, as that of being in constant Fear: Well does the
Scripture say, the Fear of Man brings a Snare; it is a Life of Death,
and the Mind is so entirely suppress'd by it, that it is capable of no
Relief; the animal Spirits sink, and all the Vigour of Nature, which
usually supports Men under other Afflictions, and is present to them
in the greatest Exigencies, fails them here.
Nor did it fail of its usual Operations upon the Fancy, by heightening
every Danger, representing the English and Dutch Captains to be
Men incapable of hearing Reason, or of distinguishing between
honest Men and Rogues; or between a Story calculated for our own
Turn, made out of nothing, on purpose to deceive; and a true genuine
Account of our whole Voyage, Progress, and Design; for we might
many Ways have convinc'd any reasonable Creature, that we were
not Pirates; the Goods we had on board, the Course we steered, or
frankly showing ourselves, and entering into such and such Ports;
and even our very Manner, the Force we had, the Number of Men,
the few Arms, little Ammunition, short Provisions; all these would
have served to convince any Men, that we were no Pirates; the
Opium, and other Goods we had on board, would make it appear,
the Ship had been at Bengal; the Dutchmen, who it was said, had
the Names of all the Men that were in the Ship, might easily see
that we were a Mixture of English, Portuguese, and Indians, and but
two Dutchmen on board: These, and many other particular Circum-
stances, might have made it evident to the Understanding of any
Commander, whose Hands we might fall into, that we were no
Pirates.
But Fear, that blind useless Passion, worked another Way, and
threw us into the Vapours; it bewilder'd our Understandings, and
set the Imagination at Work, to form a thousand terrible Things, that
perhaps might never happen; we first suppos'd, as indeed everybody
fiad related to us, that the Seamen on board the English and Dutch
Ships, but especially the Dutch, were so enrag'd at the Name of a
Pirate, and especially at our beating of their Boats, and escaping, that
diey would not give themselves Leave to inquire, whether we were
Pirates or no; but would execute us off Hand, as we call it, withmt
giving us any Room for a Defence; we reflected that there was
really so much apparent Evidence before them, that they wou'd
scarce inquire after any more; as first, That the Ship was certainly
the same, and that some of the Seamen among them knew her, and
had been on board her; and secondly, That when we had Intelli-
gence at the River of Cambodia, that they were coming down to
examine us, we fought their Boat and fled; so that we made no
doubt but they were fully satisfy'd of our being Pirates, as we were
satisfy'd of the contrary; and as I often said, I know not but I should
have been apt to have taken those Circumstances for Evidence, if the
Tables were turned, and my Case was theirs, and have made no
Scruple of cutting all the Crew to Pieces, without believing, or perhaps
considering, what they might have to offer in their Defence.
But let that be how it will, those were our Apprehensions; and
both my Partner and I too, scarce slept a Night, without dreaming of
Halters, and Yard-Arms; that is to say, Gibbets, of fighting, and
being taken; of killing and being killed; and one Night I was in
such a Fury in my Dream, fancying the Dutchmen had boarded us,
and I was knocking one of their Seamen down, that I struck my
double Fist against the Side of the Cabin I lay in, with such a Force,
as wounded my Hand most grievously, broke my Knuckles, and cut
and bruised the Flesh; so that it not only waked me out of my Sleep,
but I was once afraid I should have lost two of my Fingers.
Another Apprehension I had, was of the cruel Usage we might
meet with from them, if we fell into their Hands; then the Story of
Amboyna came into my Head, and how the Dutch might perhaps
torture us, as they did our Countrymen there; and make some of our
Men, by Extremity of Torture, confess those Crimes they never were
guilty of; own themselves, and all of us to be Pirates, and so they
would put us to Death, with a formal Appearance of Justice; and
that they might be tempted to do this, for the Gain of our Ship and
Cargo, which was worth four or five thousand Pound, put all together.
These Things tormented me and my Partner too, Night and Day;
nor did we consider that the Captains of Ships have no Authority to
act thus; and if we had surrender^ Prisoners to them, they could not
answer the destroying us, or torturing us, but would be accountable
for it, when they came into their own Country: This I say, gave me
no Satisfaction; for if they will act thus with us, what Advantage
A VISION OF THE ISLAND
would it be to us, that they would be called to an Account for it; or
if we were first to be murder'd, what Satisfaction would it be to ui
to have them punish'd when they came Home?
I cannot refrain taking Notice here, what Reflections I now had
upon the past Variety of my particular Circumstances; how hard I
thought it was, that I who had spent forty Years in a Life of continu'd
Difficulties, and was at last come as it were to the Port or Haven,
which all Men drive at, (viz.) to have Rest and Plenty, should be a
Volunteer in new Sorrows, by my own unhappy Choice; and that I,
who had escap'd so many Dangers in my Youth, should now come to
be hanged in my old Age, and in so remote a Place, for a Crime I was
not in the least inclin'd to, much less really guilty of; and in a Place
and Circumstance where Innocence was not like to be any Protection
at all to me.
After these Thoughts, something of Religion would come in; and
I should be considering, that this seemed to me to be a Disposition of
immediate Providence, and I ought to look upon it, and submit to it
as such; that although I was innocent as to Men, I was far from being
innocent as to my Maker; and I ought to look in and examine, what
other Crimes in my Life, were most obvious to me; and for which,
Providence might justly inflict this Punishment, as a Retribution; and
that I ought to submit to this, just as I would to a Shipwreck, if it
had pleased God to have brought such a Disaster upon me.
In its Turn, Natural Courage would sometimes take its Place; and
then I would be talking myself up to vigorous Resolutions, that I
would not be taken, to be barbarously used by a Parcel of merciless
Wretches, in cold Blood; that it were much better to have fallen into
the Hands of the Savages, who were Man-Eaters, and who, I was
sure, would feast upon me, when they had taken me; than by those,
who would perhaps glut their Rage upon me, by inhuman Tortures
and Barbarities ; that in the Case of the Savages, I always resolv'd to
die fighting, to the last Gasp ; and why should I not do so, seeing it
was much more dreadful to me at least, to think of falling into these
Men's Hands, than ever it was to think of being eaten by Men; for
the Savages, give them their Due, would not eat a Man till he was
dead, and killed them first, as we do a Bullock; but that these Men
had many Arts beyond the Cruelty of Death: Whenever these
Thoughts prevail'd, I was sure to put myself in a kind of Fever, with
the Agitations of a suppos'd Fight: my Blood would boil, and my
(. L
Eyes sparkle, as if I was engag'd; and I always resolv'd that I would
take no Quarter at their Hands; but even at last, if I could resist no
longer, I would blow up the Ship and all that was in her, and leave
them but little Booty to boast of.
By how much the greater Weight, the Anxieties and Perplexities of
these Things were to our Thoughts while we were at Sea, by so much
the greater was our Satisfaction, when we saw ourselves on Shore;
and my Partner told me he dreamed, that he had a very heavy Load
upon his Back, which he was to cany up a Hill, and found that he was
not able to stand long under it; but that the Portuguese Pilot came
and took it off his Back, and the Hill disappear'd, the Ground before
him showing all smooth and plain, and truly it was so, we were all
like Men, who had a Load taken off their Backs.
For my Part, I had a Weight taken uff from my Heart, that I was
not able any longer to bear; and as I said above, we resolv'd to go
no more to Sea in that Ship: When we came on Shore, the old
Pilot, who was now our Friend, got us a Lodging and a Warehouse
for our Goods, which by the Way, was much the same: it was a little
House or Hut, with a large House joining to it, all built with Canes,
and palisadoed round with large Canes, to keep out pilfering Thieves,
of which, it seems, there were not a few in that Country; however,
the Magistrates allow'd us also a little Guard, and we had a Sentinel
with the kind of Halberd, or Half-pike, who stood Sentinel at our Door;
to whom we allow'd a Pint of Rice, and a little Piece of Money, about
the Value of three Pence per Day, so that our Goods were kept very
safe.
The Fair or Mart, usually kept in this Place, had been over some
Time; however, we found that there were three or four Junks in the
River, and two Japanners, I mean, Ships from Japan, with Goods
which they had bought in China, and were not gone away, having
Japanese Merchants on Shore.
The first Thing our old Portuguese Pilot did for us, was to bring us
acquainted with three missionary Romish Priests, who were in the
Town, and who had been there some Time, converting the People to
Christianity; but we thought they made but poor Work of it, and
made them but sorry Christians when they had done; however, that
was none of our Business: One of these was a Frenchman, whom
they called Father Simon; he was a jolly well-condition'd Man, very
free in his Conversation, not seeming so serious and grave, as the
other two did; one of whom was a Portuguese, and the other a
Genoese; but Father Swum was courteous, easy in his Manner, and
very agreeable Company; the other two were more reserv'd, seemed
rigid and austere, and apply'd seriously to the Work they came about,
(viz.) to talk with, and insinuate themselves among the Inhabitants,
wherever they had Opportunity; we often eat and drank with those
Men, and though I must confess, the Conversion as they call it, of the
Chinese to Christianity, is so far from the true Conversion requir'd, to
bring Heathen People to the Faith of Christ, that it seems to amount
to little more, than letting them know the Name of Christ, and say
some Prayers to the Virgin Mary, and her Son, in a Tongue which
they understand not, and to cross themselves and the like; yet it must
be confess'd that these Religious, who we call Missionaries, have a
firm Belief that these People shall be saved, and that they are the In-
struments of it; and on this Account, they undergo not only the
Fatigue of the Voyage, and Hazards of living in such Places, but
oftentimes Death itself, with the most violent Tortures, for the Sake
of this Work; and it would be a great Want of Charity in us, what-
ever Opinion we have of the Work itself, and the Manner of their
doing it, if we should not have a good Opinion of their Zeal, who
undertook it with so many Hazards, and who have no Prospect of the
least Temporal Advantage to themselves.
But to return to my Story; this French Priest, Father Simon, was
appointed it seems, by Order of the Chief of the Mission, to go up to
Pekin, the Royal Seat of the Chinese Emperor, and waited only for
another Priest, who was order'd to come to him from Macao, to go
along with him; and we scarce ever met together, but he was inviting
me to go that Journey, telling me, how he would show me all the
glorious Things of that mighty Empire; and among the rest, the
greatest City in the World; a City, said he, that your London and our
Paris put together, cannot be equal to. This was the City of Pekin. x
which I confess is very great, and infinitely full of People; but as I
looked on those Things with different Eyes from other Men, so I
shall give my Opinion of them in few Words, when I come in the
Course of my Travels, to speak more particularly of them.
But first, I come to my Friar or Missionary; dining with him one
Day, and being very merry together, I showed some little Inclination
to go with him, and he pressed me and try Partner very hard, and with
a great many Persuasions to consent; whv. Father Simon, says mj
Partner, why should you desire our Company so much? You know
we are Heretics, and you do not love us, nor cannot keep us Com-
pany with any Pleasure. O! says he, You may perhaps be good
Catholics in Time; my business here is to convert Heathens, and
who knows but I may convert you too. Very well, Father, said I, so
you will preach to us all the Way; I won't be troublesome to you,
says he; our Religion does not divest us of good Manners; besides,
says he, we are here like Countrymen, and so we are compared to
the Place we are in; and if you are Hugonots, and I a Catholic, we
may be all Christians at last; at least, said he, we are all Gentlemen,
and we may converse so, without being uneasy to one another. I
liked that Part of his Discourse very well, and it began to put me in
Mind of my Priest, that I had left in the Brasils; but this Father
Simon did not come up to his Character, by a great deal; for though
Father Simon had no Appearance of a criminal Levity in him neither,
yet he had not that Fund of Christian Zeal, strict Piety, and sincere
Affection to Religion, that my other good Ecclesiastic had, of whom
I have said so much.
But to leave him a little, though he never left us, nor soliciting us
to go with him; but we had something else before us at first; for wj
had all this while our Ship, and our Merchandize to dispose of, and
we began to be very doubtful what we should do, for we were now in
a Place of very little Business; and once I was about to venture to
sail for the River of Kilam, and the City of Nankin: But Providence
seemed now more visibly as I thought, than ever, to concern itself in
our Affair; and I was encourag'd from this very Time, to think, 1
should one Way or other get out of this tangled Circumstance, and
be brought Home to my own Country again, though I had not the
least View of the Manner; and when I began sometimes to think of
it, could not imagine by what method it was to be done: Providence,
/ say, began here to clear up our Way a little; and the first Thing
that offer'd was, that our old Portuguese Pilot brought a Japan
Merchant to us, who began to inquire what Goods we had; and in
the first Place, he bought all our Opium, and gave us a very good
Price for it, paying us in Gold by Weight, some in small Pieces of
their own Coin, and some in small Wedges, of about ten or eleven
Ounces each. While we were dealing with him for our Opium, it
came into my Head, that he might perhaps deal with us for the Ship
too, and I order'd the Interpreter to propose it to him; he shrunk up
his Shoulders at it when it was first propos'd to him; but hi a few
Days after, he came to me with one of the Missionary Priests for hit
Interpreter, and told me he had a Proposal to make to me, and that
was this; he had bought a great Quantity of Goods of us, when he
had no Thoughts (or Proposals made to him) of buying the Ship; and
that therefore, he had not Money enough to pay for the Ship; but if
I would let the same Men who were in the Ship navigate her, hs
would hire the Ship to go to Japan, and would send them from thence
to the Philippine Islands with another Loading, which he would pay
the Freight of, before they went from Japan; and that at their Return,
he would buy the Ship: I began to listen to his Proposal, and so
eager did my Head still run upon Rambling, that I could not but
begin to entertain a Notion of going myself with him, and so to sail from
the Philippine Islands, away to the South-Seas; and accordingly I
asked the Japanese Merchant, if he would not hire us to the Philippine
Islands, and discharge us there; he said, No he could not do that,
for then he could not have the Return of his Cargo; but he would
discharge us in Japan, he said, at the Ship's Return. Well, still I was
for taking him at that Proposal, and going myself; but my Partner,
wiser than myself, persuaded me from it, representing the Dangers as
well of the Seas, as of the Japaneses, who are a false, cruel, and
treacherous People; and then of the Spaniards, at the Philippines,
more false, more cruel, and more treacherous than they.
But to bring this long Turn of our Affairs to a Conclusion; the
first Thing we had to do, was to consult with the Captain of the Ship,
and with his Men, and know if they were willing to go to Japan; and
while I was doing this, the young Man, who, as I said, my Nephew
had left with me as my Companion for my Travels, came to me, and
told me, that he thought that Voyage promised very fair, and that
there was a great Prospect of Advantage, and he would be very glad
if I undertook it; but that if I would not, and would give him leave,
he would go as a Merchant, or how I pleased to order him; that if
ever he came to England, and I was there and alive, he would render
me a faithful Account of his Success, and it should be as much mine
as I pleased.
I was really loth to part with him, but considering the Prospect of
Advantage, which was really considerable, and that he was a young
Fellow as likely to do well in it as any I knew, I inclin'd to let him
go; but first I told him, I would consult my Partner, and give hiir
an Answer the next Day; my Partner and I discours'd about it, and
my Partner made a most generous Offer; he told me, you know it
has been an unlucky Ship, and we both resolve not to go to Sea in it
again; if your Steward, so he called my Man, will venture the Voyage,
I'll leave my Share of the Vessel to him, and let him make his best of
it; and if we live to meet in England, and he meets with Success
abroad, he shall Account for one Half of the Profits of the Ship's
Freight to us, the other shall be his own.
If my Partner, who was no Way concern'd with my young Man,
made him such an Offer, I could do no less than offer him the same;
and all the Ship's Company being willing to go with him, we made
over Half the Ship to him in Property, and took a Writing from him,
obliging him to account for the other, and away he went to Japan.
The Japan Merchant proved a very punctual honest Man to him, pro-
tected him at Japan, and got him a Licence to come on Shore, which
the Europeans in general have not lately obtain'd; paid him his
Freight very punctually, sent him to the Philippines, loaded with Japan,
and China Wares, and a Supercargo of their own, who trafficking with
the Spaniards, brought back European Goods again, and a great
Quantity of Cloves, and other Spice; and there he was not oDly paid
his Freight very well, and at a very good Price, but being not willing
to sell the Ship then, the Merchant furnish'd him with Goods on his
own Account; that for some Money, and some Spices of his own,
which he brought with him, he went back to the Manillas to the
Spaniards, where he sold his Cargo very well: Here having gotten
a good Acquaintance at Manilla, he got his Ship made a free Ship;
and the Governor of Manilla hired him, to go to Acapulco, in America,
on the Coast of Mexico, and gave him a Licence to Land there, and
travel to Mexico, and to pass in any Spanish Ship to Europe, with all
his Men.
He made the Voyage to Acapulco very happily, and there he sold
his Ship; and having there also obtained Allowance to travel by
Land, to Porto Bcllo, he found Means somehow or other, to get to
Jamaica, with all his Treasure; and about eight Years after, came to
England exceeding Rich; of the which, I shall take Notice in its
Place; in the mean time, I return to our particular Affairs.
Being now to part with the Ship, and Ship's Company, it came be-
fore us of Course to consider what Recompense we should give to
the two Men that gave us such timely Notice of the Design
against us in the River of Cambodia. The Truth was, that they had
done us a considerable Service, and deserv'd well at our Hands j
though by the Way, they were a Couple of Rogues too; for as they
believ'd the Story of our being Pirates, and that we had really run
away with the Ship, they came down to us, not only to betray the
Design that was formed against us, but to go to Sea with us as
Pirates; and one of them confess'd afterwards, that nothing else
but the Hopes of going a Roguing brought him to do it; however,
the Service they did us was not the less; and therefore, as I had pro-
mis'd to be grateful to them, I first order'd the Money to be paid
to them, which they said was due to them on board their respective
Ships; that is to say, the Englishman nineteen Months' Pay, and to
the Dutchman seven; and over and above that, I gave them, each
of them, a small Sum of Money in Gold, and which contented them
very well; then I made the Englishman Gunner in the Ship, the
Gunner being now made second Mate, and Purser; the Dutchman
I made Boatswain; so they were both very well pleased, and proved
very serviceable, being both able Seamen, and very stout Fellows.
We were now on Shore in China; if I thought myself banish'd,
and remote from my own Country at Bengal, where I had many
Ways to get home for my Money; what could I think of myself
now? When I was gotten about a thousand Leagues farther off
from Home, and perfectly destitute of all Manner of Prospect of
Return.
All we had for it was this, that in about four Months' Time,
there was to be another Fair at the Place where we were; and
then we might be able to purchase all sorts of the Manufactures of
the Country, and withal, might possibly find some Chinese Junks 01
Vessels from Tonquin, that would be to be sold, and would carry us
and our Goods whither we pleased; this I liked very well, and re-
solv'd to wait; besides, as our particular Persons were not obnoxious,
so if any English or Dutch Ships came thither, perhaps we might have
an Opportunity to load our Goods, and get Passage to some other
Place in India, nearer Home.
Upon these Hopes we resoh/d to continue here; but to divert
ourselves, we took two or three Journeys into the Country; first we
rent ten Days'Journey to seethe Cityof Nankin, and a City well worth
seeing indeed; they say it has a Million of People in it; which, how
ever, I do not believe; it is regularly built, the Streets all exactlj
straight, and cross one another in direct Lines, which gives the
Figure of it great Advantage.
But when I come to compare the miserable Feople of these
Countries with ours, their Fabrics, their manner of Living, their
Government, their Religion, their Wealth, and their Glory, (as some
call it,) I must confess I do not so much as think it is worth naming,
or worth my while to write of, or any that shall come after me to
read.
It is very observable that we wonder at the Grandeur, the Riches,
the Pomp, the Ceremonies, the Government, the Manufactures, the
Commerce, and the Conduct of these People; not that it is to be
wonder^ at, or indeed in the least to be regarded; but because,
having first a true Notion of the Barbarity of those Countries, the
Rudeness and the Ignorance that prevails there, we do not expect to
find any such things so far off.
Otherwise, what are their Buildings to the Palaces and Royal
Buildings of Europe? What their Trade, to the universal Com-
merce of England, Holland, France and Spain? What are their Cities
to ours, for Wealth, Strength, Gaiety of Apparel, rich Furniture, and
an infinite Variety? What are their Ports, supply'd with a few Junks
and Barks, to our Navigation, our Merchant Fleets, our large and
powerful Navies? Our City of London has more Trade than all their
mighty Empire: one English, or Dutch, or French Man-of-War of
80 Guns, would fight and destroy all the Shipping of China: But the
Greatness of their Wealth, their Trade, the Power of their Govern-
ment, and Strength of their Armies, is surprising to us, because, as I
have said, considering them as a barbarous Nation of Pagans, litde
better than Savages, we did not expect such Things among them;
and this indeed is the Advantage with which all their Greatness and
Power is represented to us; otherwise it is in itself nothing at all;
for as I have said of their Ships, so may be said of their Armies and
Troops; all the Forces of their Empire, though they were to bring
two Millions of Men into the Field together, would be able to do
nothing but ruin the Country, and starve themselves: If they were
to besiege a strong Town in Flanders, or to fight a disciplin'd Army,
one Line of German Cuirassiers, or of French Cavalry, would over-
throw all the Horse of China; a Million of their Foot could nol
stand before one embattled Body of our Infantry, posted so as not
to be surrounded, though they were to be not One to Twenty in
Number; nay, I do not boast if I say that 30,000 German or English
Foot, and 10,000 French Horse, would fairly beat all the Forces of
China: And so of our fortified Towns, and of the Art of our Engi-
neers in assaulting and defending Towns; there is not a fortified
Town in China could hold out one Month against the Batteries and
Attacks of an European Army; and at the same time, all the
Armies of China could never take such a Town as Dunkirk, provided
it was not starved; no, not in a ten Years' Siege. They have Fire-
Arms, it is true, but they are awkward, clumsy, and uncertain in going
off: They have Powder, but it is of no Strength: They have neither
Discipline in the Field, Exercise to their Arms, Skill to Attack, or
Temper to Retreat; and therefore, I must confess, it seemed strange
to me, when I came Home, and heard our People say such
fine Things of the Power, Riches, Glory, Magnificence, and Trade of
the Chinese; because I saw, and knew, that they were a contemptible
Herd or Crowd of ignorant sordid Slaves, subjected to a Government
qualified only to rule such a People; and in a word, for I am now
launched quite beside my Design, I say, in a word, were not its
Distance inconceivably great from Muscovy, and was not the Muscovite
Empire almost as rude, impotent, and ill govern'd a Crowd of Slaves
as they, the Czar of Muscovy might with much Ease drive them all
out of their Country, and conquer them in one Campaign; and had
the Czar, who I since hear is a growing Prince, and begins to appear
foimidable in the World, fallen this Way, instead of attacking the
warlike Swedes, in which Attempt none of the Powers of Europe
would have envy'd or interrupted him; he might by this time have
been Emperor of China, instead of being beaten by the King of
Sweden at Narva, when the latter was not One to Six in Number. As
their Strength and their Grandeur, so their Navigation, Commerce,
and Husbandry, is imperfect and impotent, compar'd to the same
Things in Europe; also in their Knowledge, their Learning, their
Skill in the Sciences; they have Globes and Spheres, and a Smatch
of the Knowledge of the Mathematics; but when you come to inquire
into their Knowledge, how short-sighted are the wisest of their
Students! they know nothing of the Motion of the Heavenly Bodies;
and so grossly absurdly ignorant, that when the Sun is eclips'd, they
think it is a great Dragon has assaulted and run away with it, and
they fall a clattering with all the Drums and Kettles in the Country,
to fright the Monster away, just as we do to hive a Swarm of Bees.
As this is the only Excursion of this kind which I have made in
all the Account I have given of my Travels, so I shall make no more
Descriptions of Countries and People, it is none of my Business, or
any part of my Design; but giving an Account of my own Adven-
tures, through a Life of inimitable Wanderings, and a long Variety of
Changes, which perhaps few that come after me will have heard the
like of; I shall therefore say very little of all the mighty Places, desert
Countries, and numerous People, I have yet to pass through more
than relates to my own Story, and which my Concern among them
will make necessary. I was now, as near as I can compute, in the
heart of China, about the Latitude of thirty Degrees North of the
Line, for we were return'd from Nankin; I had indeed a mind to
see the City of Pekin, which I had heard so much of, and Father
Simon importun'd me daily to do it; at length his Time of going
away being set, and the other Missionary, who was to go with him,
being arriv'd from Macao, it was necessary that we should resolve,
either to go, or not to go; so I referr'd him to my Partner, and left it
wholly to his Choice, who at length resolv'd it in the Affirmative, and
we prepar'd for our Journey. We set out with very good Ad-
vantage, as to finding the Way, for we got leave to travel in the
Retinue of one of their Mandarins, a kind of Viceroy, or principal
Magistrate in the Province where they reside, and who take great
State upon them, travelling with great Attendance, and with great
Homage from the People, who are sometimes greatly impoverish'd
by them, because all the Countries they pass through are oblig'd to
furnish Provisions for them and all their Attendance: That which
I particularly observed, as to our travelling with his Baggage, was this,
That though we received sufficient Provisions, both for ourselves and
our Horses, from the Country, as belonging to the Mandarin, yet
we were obliged to pay for everything we had, after the Market Price
of the Country, and the Mandarin's Steward, or Commissary of the
Provisions, collected it duly from us; so that our travelling in the
Retinue of the Mandarin, though it was a very great Kindness to us,
was not such a mighty Favour in him, but was indeed a great
Advantage to him, considering there were above thirty other People
travelled in the same Manner besides us, under the Protection of his
Retinue, or as we may call it, under his Convoy: This, I say, was a
great Advantage to him, for the Country furnish'd all the Provisioni
for nothing, and he took all our Money for them.
We were five and twenty Days travelling to Pekin, through a
Country infinitely populous, but miserably cultivated ; the Husbandry,
the Economy, and the Way of living miserable, though they boast
so much of the Industry of the People; I say miserable, and so it
is, if we who understand how to live were to endure it, or to com-
pare it with our own, but not so to these poor Wretches who know
no other: The Pride of these People is infinitely great, and exceeded
by nothing but their Poverty, which adds to that which I call their
Misery; and I must needs think the naked Savages of America live
much more happy, because, as they have nothing, so they desire
nothing; whereas these are proud and insolent, and in the main are
mere Beggars and Drudges; Their Ostentation is inexpressible, and
is chiefly showed in their Clothes and Building, and in the keeping
Multitudes of Servants or Slaves, and, which is to the last Degree
ridiculous, their Contempt of all the World but themselves.
I must confess, I travell'd more pleasantly afterwards in the Deserts
and vast Wildernesses of Grand Tartary, than here; and yet the
Roads here are well paved, and well kept, and very convenient for
Travellers: but nothing was more awkward to me, than to see such
a haughty, imperious, insolent People, in the midst of the grossest
Simplicity and Ignorance, for all their famed Ingenuity is no more:
And my Friend Father Simon and I used to be very merry upon
these Occasions, to see the beggarly Pride of those People; for
Example: Coming by the House of a Country Gentleman, as Father
Simon called him, about ten Leagues off of the City of Nankin, we
had first of all the Honour to ride with the Master of the House
about two Miles: The State he rode in was a perfect Don Quixotism,
being a Mixture of Pomp and Poverty.
The Habit of this greasy Don was very proper for a Scaramouch or
Merry-Andrew, being a dirty Calico, with all the Tawdry and Trap-
ping of a Fool's Coat, such as Hanging-sleeves, Tassels, and Cuts and
Slashes almost on every Side; it covered a Taffety Vest, as greasy
as a Butcher, and which testify'd that his Honour must needs be a
most exquisite Sloven.
His Horse was a poor, lean, starved, hobbling Creature, such as in
England might sell for about 30 or 40 Shillings, and he had two
Slaves folloVd him on Foot, to drive the poor Creature along; he
had a Whip in his Hand, and he belabour'd the Beast as fast about
the Head, as his Slaves did about the Tail, and thus he rode by us
with about ten or twelve Servants, and we were told he was goinj,
from the City to his Country Seat, about half a League before us:
We travell'd on gently, but this Figure of a Gentleman rode away
before us, and as we stopped at a Village about an Hour to refresh us,
when we came by the Country Seat of this great Man, we saw him
in a little Place, before his Door, eating his Repast; it was a Kind
of a Garden, but he was easy to be seen, and we were given to
understand that the more we looked on him, the better he would be
pleased.
He sat under a Tree, something like the Palmetto Tree, which
effectually shaded him over the Head, and on the South Side, but
under the Tree also, was placed a large Umbrella, which made that
Part look well enough; he sat lolling back in a great Elbow Chair,
being a heavy corpulent Man, and his Meat being brought him by
two Women Slaves; he had two more, whose Office, I think, few
Gentlemen in Europe would accept of their Service in, (viz.) One fed
the Squire with a Spoon, and the othev held the Dish with one Hand,
and scraped off what he let fall upon his Worship's Beard and Taffety
Vest, while the great fat Brute thought it below him to employ his
own Hands in any of those familiar Offices, which Kings and Monarchs
would rather do, than be troubled with the clumsy Fingers of their
Servants.
I took this Time to think what Pain Men's Pride puts them to;
and how troublesome a haughty Temper, thus ill-manag'd, must be to a
Man of common Sense; and leaving the poor Wretch to please him-
self with our looking at him, as if we admir'd his Pomp, whereas we
really pitied and contemn'd him, we pursu'd our Journey; onlj
Father Simon had the Curiosity to stay to inform himself what
Dainties the Country Justice had to feed on, in all his State, which
he said he had the Honour to taste of, and which was, I think, a
Dose that an English Hound would scarce have eaten, if it had been
offer'd him, (vis.) a Mess of boiled Rice with a great Piece of Garlic
in it, and a little Bag filled with Green Pepper, and another Plant
which they have here, something like our Ginger, but smelling like
Musk, and tasfing like Mustard; all this was put together, and a small
Lump or Piece of lean Mutton boiled in it; and this was his Wor-
ship's Repast, four or five Servants more attending at a Distance. If
he fed them meaner than he was fed himself, the Spice excepted,
they must fare very coarsely indeed.
As for our Mandarin, with whom we travell'd, he was respected
like a King; surrounded always with his Gentlemen, and attended in
all his Appearances with such Pomp, that I saw little of him but at a
Distance, but this I observ'd, that there was not a Horse in his
Retinue, but that our Carriers' Pack-Horses in England seem to me to
look much better, but they were so cover'd with Equipage, Mantles,
Trappings and such like Trumpery, that you cannot see whether
they are fat or lean; in a Word, we could see scarce anything but
their Feet and their Heads.
I was now light-hearted, and all my Trouble and Perplexity that I
have given an Account of being over, I had no anxious Thoughts
about me, which made this Journey the pleasanter to me, nor had I
any ill Accident attended me, only in the passing or fording a small
River, my Horse fell, and made me free of the Country, as they call
it, that is to say, threw me in; the Place was not deep, but it wetted
me all over; I mention it because it spoiled my Pocket-Book, wherein
I had set down the Names of several People and Places which I had
Occasion to remember, and which, not taking due Care of, the Leaves
rotted, and the Words were never after to be read, to my great Loss,
as to the Names of some Places I touched at in this Voyage.
At length we arriv'd at Pekin; I had nobody with me but the
Youth, whom my Nephew, the Captain, had given me to attend me as
a Servant, and who proved very trusty and diligent; and my Partner
had nobody with him but one Servant, who was a Kinsman: as for
the Portuguese Pilot, he being desirous to see the Court, we gave him
his Passage, that is to say, bore his Charges for his Company; and to
use him as an Interpreter, for he understood the Language of the
Country, and spoke good French, and a little English; and indeed,
this old Man was a most useful Implement to us everywhere; for we
liad not been above a week at Pekin, when he came laughing, Ah,
Seignior Inglese, says he, / have something to tell you -will make your
Heart glad. My Heart glad, says I, What can that be? Idon't know
anything in this Country can either give me Joy or Grief to any great
degree. Yes, yes, said the old Man in broken English, make you glad,
me sorrow; sorry he would have said. This made me more inquisi-
tive. Why, said I, will it make you sorry? Because, said he, you
have brought me here 25 Days' Journey, and will leave me logo back
alone, and which way shall I get to my Port afterwards, without a
Ship, without a Horse, without Pecune? So he called Money,
being his broken Latin, of which he had abundance to make us
merry with.
In short, he told us there was a great Caravan of Muscovite and
Polish Merchants in the City, and they were preparing to set out on
their Journey by Land to Muscovy within four or five Weeks, and he
was sure we would take the Opportunity to go with them, and leave
him behind to go back all alone. I confess, I was surpris'd with his
News, a secret Joy spread itself over my own Soul, which I cannot
describe, and never felt before or since, and I had no power for a
good while to speak a Word to the old Man; but at last I turned to
him; How do you know this, said I, aic you sure it is true? Yes,
says he, I met this Morning in the Street an old Acquaintance of
mine, an Armenian, or one you call a Grecian, who is among them;
he came last from Astracan, and was designing to go to Tonquin,
where I formerly knew him, but has alter'd his mind, and is now re-
solv'd to go with the Caravan to Moscow, and so down the River
Volga to Astracan. Well, Seignior, says I, do not be uneasy about
being left to go back alone, if this be a Method for my return to
England, it shall be your Fault if you go back to Macao at all. We
then went to consulting together what was to be done, and I asked my
Partner what he thought of the Pilot's News, and whether it would
suit with his Affairs? He told me he would do just as I would, for
he had settled all his Affairs so well at Bengal, and left his Effects in
such good Hands, that as we had made a good Voyage here, if he
could vest it in China Silks, wrought and raw, such as might be worth
the Carriage, he would be content to go England, and then make his
Voyage back to Bengal, by the Company's Ships.
Having resolv'd upon this, we agreed, that if our Portugal Pilot
would go with us, we would bear his Charges to Moscow or to England
if he pleas'd; nor indeed were we to be esteem'd over generous in that
Part neither, if we had not rewarded him farther, for the Service he
had done us was really worth all that, and more; for he had not only
been a Pilot to us at Sea, but he had been like a Broker for us on
Shore; and his procuring for us the Japan Merchant, was some
hundred of Pounds in our Pocket: So we consulted together about it,
and being willing to gratify him, which was indeed but doing him
Justice, and very willing also to have him with us besides, for he
was a most necessary Man on all Occasions, we agreed to give him a
Quantity of coined Gold, which, as I compute it, came to about 175
Pounds Sterling between us, and to bear all his Charges, both for
himself and Horse, except only a Horee to carry his Goods.
Having settled this among ourselves, we called him to let him know
what we had resolv'd; I told him, he had complain'd of our being to
let him go back alone, and I was now to tell him we were resolv'd he
should not go back at all: that as we had resolv'd to go to Europe
with the Caravan, we resolv'd also he should go with us, and that we
called him, to know his mind. He shook his Head, and said, it was
a long Journey, and he had no Pecune to carry him thither, or to
subsist himself when he came there. We told him we believ'd it
was so, and therefore we had resolv'd to do something for him, that
should let him see how sensible we were of the Service he had done
us, and also how agreeable he was to us; and then I told him what
we had resolv'd to give him here, which we might lay out as we
would do our own; and that as for his Charges, if he would go with
us, we would set him safe ashore, (Life and Casualties excepted,)
either in Muscovy or England, which he would, at our own Charge,
except only the Carriage of his Goods.
He receiv'd the Proposal like a Man transported, and told us he
would go with us over the whole World; and so, in short, we all
prepar'd ourselves for the Journey: However, as it was with us, so
it was with the other Merchants, they had many things to do, and
instead of being ready in five Weeks, it was four Months and some
odd Days before all Things were got together.
It was the Beginning of February, our Style, when we set out from
Pekin; my Partner and the old Pilot had gone express back to the
Port where he had first put in, to dispose of some Goods which we
had left there; and I with a Chinese Merchant, whom I had some
Knowledge of at Nankin, and who came to Pekin on his own
Affairs, went to Nankin, where I bought ninety Pieces of fine
Damasks, with about two hundred Pieces of other very fine Silks, of
several Sorts, some mixed with Gold, and had all these brought to
Pekin against my Partner's Return; besides this, we bought a very
large Quantity of Raw Silk, and some other Goods, our Cargo
amounting in these Goods only to about three thousand five hundred
Pounds Sterling, whi:h, together with Tea and some fine Calicoes,
and three Camels' Ixiads of Nutmegs and Cloves, loaded in all
eighteen Camels for our Share, besides those we rode upon; which
with two or three spare Horses, and two Horses loaded with
Provisions, made us in short 26 Camels and Horses in out
Retinue.
The Company was very Great, and, as near as I can remember,
made between three and four hundred Horse, and upwards of a
hundred and twenty Men, very well armed and provided for all
Events: for as the Eastern Caravans are subject to be attack'd
by the Arabs, so are these by the Tartars; but they are not altogether
so dangerous as the Arabs, nor so barbarous when they prevail.
The Company consisted of People of several Nations, such as
Muscovites chiefly, for there were above Sixty of them who were
Merchants or Inhabitants of Moscow, though of them, some were
Livonians, and to our particular Satisfaction, Five of them were Scots,
who appear'd also to be Men of great Experience in Business, and
Men of very good Substance.
When we had travell'd one Day's Journey, the Guides, who were
Five in Number, called all the Gentlemen and Merchants, that is to
say, all the Passengers except the Servants, to a great Council, as
they called it: At this great Council every one deposited a certain
Quantity of Money to a common Stock, for the necessary Expense of
buying Foiage on the Way, where it was not otherwise to be had, and
for satisfying the Guides, getting Horses, and the like: And here
they constituted the Journey, as they call it, viz. They named Captains
and Officers, to draw us all up, and give the Command in case of an
Attack, and gave every one their turn of Command: nor was this
forming us into Order any more than what we found needful upon the
Way, as shall be observ'd in its Place.
The Road all on this Side of the Country is very populous, and is
full of Potters and Earth-makers, that is to say, People that temper'd
the Earth for the China Ware; and as I was coming along, our
Portugal Pilot, who had always something or other to say to make us
merry, came sneering to me, and told me he would show me the
greatest Rarity in all the Country, and that I should have this to say
of China, after all the ill-humour'd things I had said of it, that I had
seen one thing which was not to be seen in all the World beside. I
was very importunate to know what it was: At last he told me it was
a Gentleman's house built all with China Ware. Well, says I, are not
the Materials of their Building the Product of their own Country;
and so it is all China Ware, is not it? No, no, says he, I mean it is
a House all made of China Ware, such as you call it in England;
Oi as it is called in our Country, Porcelain. Well, says I, such a
thing may be; how big is it? Can we carry it in a Box upon a
Camel? If we can, we will buy it Upon a Camel I says the old
Pilot, holding up both his Hands, why there is a Family of Thirty
People lives in it.
I was then curious indeed to see it, and when I came to it, it was
nothing but this; it was a Timber-House, or a House built, as we
call it in England, with Lath and Plaster, but all the Plastering was
really China Ware, that is to say, it was plaster'd with the Earth that
makes China Ware.
The Outside, which the Sun shone hot upon, was glazed, and looked
very well, perfect white, and painted with blue Figures, as the large
China Ware in England is painted, and hard, as if it had been burnt:
As to the Inside, all the Walls, instead of Wainscot, were lined up
with harden'd and painted Tiles, like the little square Tiles we call
Galley-Tiles in England, all made of the finest China, and the Figures
exceeding fine indeed, with extraordinary Variety of Colours mixed
with Gold, many Tiles making but one Figure, but joined so artifi-
cially, the Mortar being made of the same Earth, that it was very hard
to see where the Tiles met: The Floors of the Rooms were of the
same Composition, and as hard as the earthen Floors we have in use
in several Parts of England, especially Lincolnshire, Nottinghamshire,
Leicestershire, &c., as hard as a Stone, and smooth, but not burnt and
painted, except some smaller Rooms, like Closets, which were all as
it were paved with the same Tile; the Ceilings, and in a word, all
the plastering Work in the whole House were of the same Earth;
and after all, the Roof was cover'd with Tiles of the same, but of a
deep shining black.
This was a China Warehouse indeed, truly and literally to De
called so; and had I not been upon the Journey, I could have
stayed some Days to see and examine the Particulars of it; they
told me there were Fountains and Fish-ponds in the Garden, all
paved at the Bottom and Sides with the same, and fine Statues set
up in Rows on the Walks, entirely formed of the Porcelain Earth,
and burnt whole.
As this is one of the Singularities of China, so they may be allow'd
to excel in it; but I am very sure they excel in their Accounts of it J
lot they told me such incredible things of their Performance in
Crockery Ware, for such it is, that I care not to relate, as knowing it
M M
could not be true; they told me in particular of one Workman
that made a Ship with all its Tackle, and Masts, and Sails, in
Earthenware, big enough to carry fifty Men: If he had told me he
launched it, and made a Voyage to Japan in it, I might have said
something to it indeed; but as it was, I knew the whole of the
Story, which was in short, asking Pardon for the Word, that the
Fellow lied; so I smiled, and said nothing to it
This odd Sight kept me two Hours behind the Caravan, for which
the Leader of it for the Day fined me about the Value of three
Shillings, and told me, if it had been three Days' Journey without the
Wall, as it was three Days within, he must have fined me four times
as much, and made me ask Pardon the next Council Day; so I
promis'd to be more orderly; for indeed I found afterward the Orders
made for keeping all together, were absolutely necessary for our
common Safety.
In two Days more we passed the great China Wall, made for a
Fortification against the Tartars; and a very great Work it is, going
over Hills and Mountains in a needless Track, where the Rocks are
impassable, and the Precipices such as no Enemy could possibly
enter, or indeed climb up, or where if they did, no Wall could hinder
them: they tell us, its Length is near a thousand English Miles,
but that the Country is five hundred in a straight measur'd Line,
which the Wall bounds, without measuring the Windings and Turn-
ings it takes. It is abc at four Fathom high, and as many thick in
some Places.
I stood still an Hour or thereabout, without trespassing our
Orders, for so long the Caravan was in passing the Gate; I say, I stood
still an Hour to look at it on every Side, near, and far off; I mean,
that was within my View; and the Guide of our Caravan, who had
been extolling it for the Wonder of the World, was mighty eager to
hear my Opinion of it; I told him it was a most excellent thing to
keep off the Tartars; which he happen'd not to understand as I
meant it, and so took it for a Compliment; but the old Pilot laughed:
O, Seignior Inglese, says he, you speak in Colours : In Colours, said I,
what do you mean by that? Why, you speak what looks white this
way, and black that way; gay one way, and dull another way;
you tell him it is a good Wall to keep out Tartars? You tell me by
that, it is good for nothing but to keep out Tartars, or it will keep
out none but Tartars; I understand you Seignior Inglese, I under
stand you, says he, but Seignior Chinese understood you his own
way.
Well, says I, Seignior, do you think it would stand out an Army of
our Country People, with a good Train of Artillery; or our Engineers,
with two Companies of Miners; would not they batter it down in
ten Days, that an Army might enter in Battalia, or blow it up in the
Air, Foundation and all, that there should be no Sign of it left? Ah,
ah, says he, I know that The Chinese wanted mightily to know
what I said, and I gave him leave to tell him a few Days after, for we
were then almost out of their Country, and he was to leave us in a
little time afterward; but when he knew what I had said, he was
dumb all the rest of the way, and we heard no more of his fine Story
of the Chinese Power and Greatness, while he stayed.
After we had passed this mighty Nothing called a Wall, something
like the Picts Wall, so famous in Northumberland, and built by the
Romans, we began to find the Country thinly inhabited, and the
People rather confin'd to live in fortify'd Towns and Cities, as being
subject to the Inroads and Depredations of the Tartars, who rob in
great Armies, and therefore are not to be resisted by the naked Inha-
bitants of an open Country.
And here I began to find the Necessity of keeping together in a
Caravan as we travell'd; for we saw several Troops of Tartars
roving about; but when I came to see them distinctly, I wonder'd
more that the Chinese Empire could be conquer'd by such con-
temptible Fellows; for they are a mere Horde or Crowd of wild
Fellows, keeping no Order, and understanding no Discipline, or
manner of Fight
Their Horses are poor lean starved Creatures, taught nothing, and
fit for nothing; and this we said, the first Day we saw them, which
was after we enter'd the wilder Part of the Country; our Leader for
the Day gave Leave for about sixteen of us to go a hunting, as they
call it; and what was this, but hunting of Sheep; however, it may
be called hunting too; for the Creatures are the wildest and swiftest
of Foot that ever I saw of their Kind; only they will not run a great
way, and you are sure of Sport when you begin the Chase; for they
appear generally thirty or forty in a Flock, and like true Sheep,
always keep together when they fly.
"In Pursuit of this odd sort of Game, it was our hap to meet with
about forty Tartars; whether they were hunting Mutton as we were,
or whether they looked for another kind of Prey, I know not; but
as soon as they saw us, one of them blew a kind of a Horn very loud,
but with a barbarous Sound, that I had never heard before, and by
the way, never care to hear again: we all suppos'd this was to
call their Friends about them, and so it was; for in less than Half
a Quarter of an Hour, a Troop of forty or fifty more appear'd,
M about a Mile Distance, but our Work was over first, as it
happen'd.
One of the Scots Merchants of Moscow happen'd to be amongst us,
and as soon as he heard the Horn, he told us in short, that we had
nothing to do, but to charge them immediately without loss of Time;
and drawing us up in a Line, he asked if we were resolv'd? We told
him we were ready to follow him; so he rode directly up to them:
they stood gazing at us like a mere Crowd, drawn up in no Order,
nor showing the Face of any Order at all; but as soon as they saw
us advance, they let fly their Arrows, which however missed us
very happily; it seems they mistook not their Aim, but their
Distance; for their Arrows all fell a little short of us, but with so
true an Aim, that had we been about twenty yards nearer, we must
have had several Men wounded, if not killed.
Immediately we halted, and though it was at a great Distance, we
fired, and sent them Leaden Bullets for Wooden Arrows, following
our Shot full Gallop, to fall in among them Sword in Hand, for so
our bold Scot that led us directed; He was indeed but a Merchant,
but he behav'd with that Vigour and Bravery on this occasion, and
yet, with such a cool Courage too, that I never saw any Man in
Action fitter for Command. As soon as we came up to them, we
fired our Pistols in their Faces, and then drew; but they fled in the
greatest Confusion imaginable; the only Stand any of them made,
was on our Right, where three of them stood, and by signs called
the rest to come back to them, having a kind of Scimitar in their
Hands, and their Bows hanging at their Backs. Our brave Com-
mander, without asking anybody to follow him, gallops up close to
them, and with his Fuzee knocks one of them off his Horse, killed
the second with his Pistol, and the third ran away, and thus ended
our Fight: but we had this Misfortune attending it, (viz.) that all
our Mutton that we had in chase, got away: We had not a Man
killed or hurt; but as for the Tartars, there was about five of them
killed; who were wounded, we knew not; but this we knew, that
the other Party was so frighted with the Noise of our Guns, that they
made off, and never made any Attempt upon us.
We were all this while in the Chinese Dominion, and therefore the
Tartars were not so bold as afterwards; but in about five Days we
enter'd a vast great wild Desert, which held us three Days' and
Nights' March; and we were oblig'd to carry our Water with us in
great Leather Bottles, and to encamp all Night, just as I have heard
they do in the Desert of Arabia.
I asked whose Dominion this was in, and they told me, this was a
kind of Border, that might be called no Man's Land; being a Part of
the Great Karakathie, or Grand Tartary, but that however it was all
reckon'd to China; but that there was no Care taken here, to pre-
serve it from the Inroads of Thieves, and therefore it was reckon'd
the worst Desert in the whole World; though we were to go over some
much larger.
In passing this Wilderness, which I confess was at the first very
frightful to me, we saw two or three times little Parties of the
Tartars, but they seemed to be upon their own Affairs, and to have
no Design upon us; and so like the Man who met the Devil, if they
had nothing to say to us, we had nothing to say to them; we let
them go.
Once however, a Party of them came so near, as to stand and gaze
at us; whether it was to consider what they should do, whether attar*,
as, or not attack us, that we knew not; but when we were passed at
some distance by them, we made a Rear-Guard of forty men, and
stood ready for them, letting the Caravan pass half a Mile, or there-
abouts, before us; but after a while they marched off, only we found
they saluted us with five Arrows at their Parting; one of which
wounded a Horse so, that it disabled him; and we left him the next
Day, poor Creature, in great need of a good Farrier; we suppose
they might shoot more Arrows, which might fall short of us, but we
saw no more Arrows or Tartars that time.
We travell'd near a Month after this, the Ways being not so good as
at first, though still in the Dominions of the Emperor of China, but
lay for the most part in Villages, some of which were fortify'd, because
of the Incursions of the Tartars. When we came to one of these
Towns, (it was about two Days and a Half Journey before we were to
come to the City Nauni) I wanted to buy a Camel, of which there are
plenty to be sold all the way upon that Road, and of Horses als*\
such as they are, because so many Caravans coming that way, they
are often wanted: The Person that I spoke to to get me a Camel,
would have gone and fetched it for me, but I like a Fool must be
officious, and go myself along with him: The Place was about two
Miles out of the Village, where, it seems, they kept the Camels and
Horses feeding under a Guard.
I walked it on Foot with my old Pilot, being very desirous, for-
sooth, of a little Variety: When we came to the Place, it was a low
marshy Ground, walled round with a stone Wall, piled up dry, without
Mortar or Earth among it, like a Park, with a little Guard of Chinese
Soldiers at the Door. Having bought a Camel, and agreed for the
Price, I came away, and the Chinese man that went with me, led the
Camel; when on a sudden came up five Tartars on Horseback; two
of them seized the Fellow, and took the Camel from him, while
other three stepped up to me; and my old Pilot, seeing us as it were
unarmed, for I had no Weapon about me but my Sword, which could
but ill defend me against three Horsemen; the first that came up,
stopped short upon my drawirg my Sword, (for they are errant
Cowards); but a Second coming upon my Left, gave me a Blow on the
Head, which I aever felt till afterward, and wondered when I came
to myself, what was the matter with me, and where I was, for he
laid me flat on the Ground; but my never failing old Pilot, the Portu-
guese (so Providence unlooked for directs Deliverances from Dangers,
which to us are unforeseen) had a Pistol in his Pocket, which I knew
nothing of, nor the Tartars; neither if they had, I suppose they
would not have attack'd us: But Cowards are always boldest when
there is no Danger.
The old Man seeing me down, with a bold Heart stepped up to the
Fellow that had struck me, and laying hold of his Arm with one Hand,
and pulling him down by main Force a little towards him with the
other, shot him into the Head, and laid him dead upon the Spot;
he then immediately stepped up to him who had stopped us, as I
said, and before he could come forward again, (for it was all done as
it were in a moment) made a Blow at him with a Scimitar which he
always wore, but missing the Man, cut his Horse into the Side of his
Head, cut one of his Ears off by the Root, and a great Slice down the
Side of his Face; the poor Beast enraged with the Wound, was no
more to be govern'd by his Rider, though the Fellow sat well enough
too; but away he flew, andcarryYlhim quite oirt of the Pilot's Reach.
Mid at some Distance rising up upon his hind Legs, threw down the
Tartar, and fell upon him.
In this Interval, the poor Chinese came in, who had lost the Camel,
but he had no Weapon; however, seeing the Tartar down, and his
Horse fallen upon him, away he runs to him, and seizing upon an
ugly ill-favour'd Weapon he had by his Side, something like a Pole-
axe, but not a Pole-axe neither, he wrenched it from him, and made
shift to knock his Tartarian Brains out with it But my old Man
had the third Tartar to deal with still, and seeing he did not fly, as
he expected, nor come on to fight him, as he apprehended, but stand
stock still, the old Man stood still too, and falls to work with his
Tackle to charge his Pistol again; but as soon as the Tartar saw the
Pistol, whether he suppos'd it to be the same, or another, I know not,
but away he scoured, and left my Pilot, my Champion I called him
afterward, a complete Victory.
By this time I was a little awake, for I thought when first I began
to wake, that I had been in a sweet Sleep; but as I said above, I
wonder'd where I was, how I came upon the Ground, and what was
the matter: In a word, a few moments after, as Sense return'd, I
felt Pain, though I did not know where; I clapped my Hand to my
Head, and took it away bloody; then I felt my Head ache, and then
in another Moment, Memory return'd, and everything was present to
me again.
I jumped up upon my Feet instantly, and got hold of my Sword,
but no Enemies in view: I found a Tartar lie dead and his Horse
standing very quietly by him; and looking farther, I saw my Cham-
pion and Deliverer, who had been to see what the Chinese had done,
coming back with his Hanger in his Hand; the old Man seeing me
on my Feet, came running to me and embrac'd me with a great deal
of Joy, being afraid before that I had been killed, and seeing me
bloody, would see how I was hurt, but it was not much, only what
we call a broken Head; neither did I afterwards find any great In-
convenience from the Blow, other than the Place which was hurt, and
which was well again in two or three Days.
We made no great Gain however by this Victory, for we lost a
Camel, and gained a Horse; but that which was remarkable, when
we came back to the Village, the Man demanded to be paid for the
Camel. I disputed it, and it was brought to a hearing before the
Chinese Judge of the Place; that is to say, in English, we went before
a Justice of the Peace: Give him his due, he acted with a great deal
of Prudence and Impartiality; and having heard both Sides, he
gravely asked the Chinese Man, that went with me to buy the Camel,
whose Servant he was? I am no Servant, says he, but went with the
Stranger. At whose Request? says the Justice. At the Stranger's
Request, says he. Why then, says the Justice, you were the
Stranger's Servant for the Time, and the Camel being deliver'd to bis
Servant, it was deliver'd to him, and he must pay for it
I confess the Thing was so clear, that I had not a Word to say; but
admiring to see such just Reasoning upon the Consequence, and so
accurate stating the Cause, I paid willingly for the Camel, and sent for
another; but you may observe, I sent for it, I did not go to fetch it
myself any more; I had enough of that
The City of Naum is a Frontier of the Chinese Empire; they call
it fortified, and so it is, as Fortifications go there; for this I will ven-
ture to affirm, that all the Tartars in Karakathie, which I believe are
some Millions, could not batter down the Walls with their Bows and
Arrows; but to call it strong, if it were attack'd with Cannon, would
be to make those who understand it, laugh at you.
We wanted, as I have said, above two Days' Journey of this City,
when Messengers were sent Express to every Part of the Road, to
tell all Travellers and Caravans, to halt till they had a Guard
sent for them; for that an unusual Body of Tartars, making ten
thousand in all, had appear^ in the Way, about thirty Miles beyond
the City.
This was very bad News to Travellers; however, it was carefully
done of the Governor, and we were very glad to hear we should have
a Guard; accordingly, two Days after, we had two hundred Soldiers
sent us from a Garrison of the Chinese, on our left, and three hundred
more from the City of Naum, and with those we advanced boldly.
The three hundred Soldiers from Naum marched in our Front, the
two hundred in our Rear, and our Men on each Side of our Camels
with our Baggage, and the whole Caravan in the Centre; in this
Order, and well prepar'd for Battle, we thought ourselves a Match
for the whole ten thousand Mongol Tartars, if they had appear'd; but
the next day when they did appear, it was quite another thing.
It was early in the Morning, when marching from a little well
situated Town called Changu, we had a River to pass, where we were
oblig'd to ferry \ and had the Tartars had any Intelligence, then had
DEFEAT OF TARTARS
been the Time to have attack'd us, when the Caravan being over, the
Rear-Guard was behind; but they did not appear.
About three Hours after, when we were enter'd upon a Desert of
about fifteen or sixteen Miles over, behold, by a Cloud of Dust they
raised, we saw an Enemy was at Hand, and they were at Hand indeed,
for they came on upon the Spur.
The Chinese, our Guard on the Front, who had talked so big the
Day before, began to stagger, and the Soldiers frequently looked
behind them, which is a certain Sign in a Soldier, that he is just ready
to run away; my old Pilot was of my mind; and being near me, he
called out, Seignior Inglese, says he, those Fellows must be encourag'd,
or they will ruin us all; for if the Tartars come on, they will never
stand it: I am of your Mind, said I, but what Course must be done t
Done! says he, let fifty of our Men advance, and flank them on each
Wing, and encourage them, and they will fight like brave Fellows in
brave Company; but without, they will every man turn his back;
immediately I rode up to our Leader, and told him, who was exactly
of our mind; and accordingly, fifty of us marched to the right Wing,
and fifty to the left, and the rest made a Line of Rescue; and so we
inarched, leaving the last two hundred Men to make another Body
by themselves, and to guard the Camels; only that if need were, they
should send a hundred Men, to assist the last fifty.
In a word, the Tartars came on, and an innumerable Company
they were; how many, we could not tell, but ten thousand we thought
was the least: A Party of them came on first, and viewed our
Posture, traversing the Ground in the Front of our Line; and as we
found them within Gun-shot, our Leader order^ the two Wings to
advance swiftly, and give them a Salvo on each Wing with their Shot,
which was done; but they went off, and I suppose back to give an
Account of the Reception they were like to meet with: and indeed
that Salute clogged their Stomach, for they immediately halted, stood
awhile to consider of it, and wheeling off to the left, they gave over
the Design, and said no more to us for that time; which was verj
agreeable to our Circumstances, which were but very indifferent for *
Battle with such a Number.
Two Days after this, we came to the City Nairn, or Naum; we
thanked the Governor for his Care for us, and collected to the Value
of a hundred Crowns, or thereabouts, which we gave to the Soldiers
sent to guard us; and here we rested one Day. This is a Garrison
indeed, and there were nine hundred Soldiers kept here; but the
Reason of it was, that formerly the Muscovite Frontiers lay nearer to
them than they do now, the Muscovites having abandon'd that Part of
Ihe Country (which lies from this City West, for about two hundred
Miles) as desolate and unfit for Use; and more especially, being so
very remote, and so difficult to send Troops thither for its Defence;
for we had yet above two thousand Miles to Muscovy, properly so
called.
After this, we passed several great Rivers, and two dreadful Deserts,
one of which we were sixteen Days passing over, and which, as I said,
was to be called no Maris Land; and on the 13 th of Aprilwe came
to the Frontiers of the Muscovite Dominions: I think the first City, or
Town, or Fortress, whatever it might be called, that belong'd to
the Czar of Muscovy, was called Argun, being on the West Side of
the River Argun.
I could not but discover an infinite Satisfaction, that I was soon
arriv'd in, as I called it, a Christian Country, or at least in a Country
govern'd by Christians; for though the Muscovites do, in my Opinion,
but just deserve the Name of Christians, yet such they pretend to be,
and are very devout in their Way: It would certainly occur to any
Man who travels the World as I have done, and who had any
Power of Reflection; I say, it would occur to him, to reflect what a
Blessing it is to be brought into the World, where the Name of God,
and of a Redeemer is known, worshipp'd and ador^; and not where
the People given up by Heaven to strong Delusions, worship the
Devil, and prostrate themselves to Stocks and Stones, worship
Monsters, Elements, horrible shaped Animals, and Statues, or Images
of Monsters: not a Town or City we passed through, but had their
Pagodas, their Idols, and their Temples, and ignorant People worship-
ping, even the Works of their own Hands.
Now we came where at least a Face of the Christian Worship ap-
pear'd, where the Knee was bowed to Jesus; and whether ignorantly
or not, yet the Christian Religion was owned, and the Name of the
true God was called upon, and ador'd; and it made the very Re-
cesses of my Soul rejoice to see it: I saluted the brave Scots Merchant
I mention'd above, with my first acknowledgment of this; and taking
him by the Hand, I said to him, Blessed be God, we are once again
come among Christians: He smiled, and answer'd, Do not rejoice
too soon, Countryman, these Muscovites are but an odd sort of
Christians; and but for the Name of it, you may see very little of the
Substance, for some Months farther of our Journey.
Well, says I, but still it is better than Paganism, and worshipping oi
Devils. Why, I'll tell you, says he, except the Russian Soldiers in
Garrisons, and a few of the Inhabitants of the Cities upon the Road,
all the rest of this Country, for above a thousand Miles faither, is
inhabited by the worst and most ignorant of Pagans; and so indeed
we found it
We were now launched into the greatest Piece of solid Earth, if I
understand anything of the Surface of the Globe, that is to be found
in any Part of the Earth; we had at least twelve hundred Miles to the
Sea, Eastward; we had at least two Thousand to the Bottom of the
Baltic Sea, Westward; and above three thousand Miles, if we left
that Sea, and went on West to the British and French Channels:
We had full five thousand Miles to the Indian, or Persian Sea, South;
and about eight hundred Miles to the Frozen Sea, North; nay, if
some People may be believ'd, there might be no Sea North-East,
till we came round the Pole, and consequently into the North-West,
and so had a Continent of Land into America., the Lord knows where,
though I could give some Reasons why I believe that to be a
Mistake.
As we enter'd into the Muscovite Dominions, a good while before
we come to any considerable Towns, we had nothing to observe there
but this; first, that all the Rivers that run to the East, as I under-
stood by the Charts, which some in our Caravan had with them; it
was plain, all those Rivers ran into the Great River Yamour, or Gam-
mour: This River, by the natural Course of it, must run into the East
Sea, or Chinese Ocean. The Story they tell us, that the Mouth of
this River is choked up with Bull-rushes, of a monstrous Growth,
(viz.) three Foot about, and twenty or thirty Foot high, I must be
allow'd to say, I believe nothing of; but as its Navigation is of no Use,
because there is no Trade that way, the Tartars, to whom alone it
belongs, dealing in nothing but Cattle, so Nobody that ever I heard
of, has been curious enough, either to go down to the Mouth of it in
Boats, or come up from the Mouth of it in Ships; but this is certain,
that this River running due East, in the Latitude of [about 50
degrees] carries a vast Concourse of Rivers along with it, and finds an
Ocean to empty itself in that Latitude; so we are sure of Sea there.
Some Leagues to the North of this River, there are several con-
siderable Rivers, whose Streams run as due North as the Yamour
runs East, and these are all found to join their Waters with the Great
River Tartarus, named so, from the northernmost Nations of the
Mongol Tartars, who the Chinese say, were the first Tartars in the
World; and who, as our Geographers allege, are the Gog and Magog
mention'd in sacred Story.
These Rivers running all Northward, as well as all the other Rivers
I am yet to speak of, make it evident, that the Northern Ocean
bounds the Land also on that Side; so that it does not seem rational
in the least to think, that the Land can extend itself to join with
America on that side, or that there is not a Communication between
the Northern and the Eastern Ocean; but of this I shall say no more,
it was my Observation at that time, and therefore I take Notice of it
in this Place. We now advanc'd from the River Arguna by easy and
moderate Journeys, and were very visibly oblig'd to the Care the Czar
of Muscovy has taken to have Cities and Towns built in as many
Places as are possible to place them, where his Soldiers keep Garrison
something like the Stationary Soldiers placed by the Romans in the re-
motest Countries of their Empire, some of which I had read partial-
larly were placed in Britain for the Security of Commerce, and fol
the lodging Travellers; and thus it was here; for wherever we came,
though at these Towns and Stations, the Garrisons and Governor were
Russians, and profess'd Christians, yet the Inhabitants of the Country
were mere Pagans, sacrificing to Idols, and worshipping the Sun,
Moon, and Stars, or all the Host of Heaven, and not only so, but
were of all the Heathens and Pagans that ever I met with, the most
barbarous, except only that they did not eat Man's Flesh, as our
Savages of America did.
Some Instances of this we met with in the Country between Arguna,
where we enter the Muscovite Dominions, and a City of Tartars and
Russians together, called Nortzinskoy, in which is a continu'd Desert
or Forest, which cost us twenty Days to travel over it; in a Village near
the last of those Places I had the Curiosity to go and see their Way
of Living, which is most brutish and insufferable ; they had I suppose
a. great Sacrifice that Day, for there stood out upon an old Stump of
a Tree, an Idol made of Wood, frightful as the Devil, at least as any-
thing we can think of to represent the Devil, can be made; it had a
Head certainly not so much as resembling any Creature that the
World ever saw \ Ears as big as Goat's Horns, and as high; Eyes as
big as a Crown-riece; a Nose like a crooked Ram's Horn, and a
Mouth extended four corner'd, like that of a Lion, with horrible Teeth,
hooked like a Parrot's under Bill; it was dressed up in the filthiest
manner that you could suppose; its upper Garment was of Sheep-
Skins, with the Wool outward, a great Tartar Bonnet on the Head,
with two Horns growing through it; it was about eight Foot high, yet
had no Feet or Legs, or any other Proportion of Parts.
This Scare-crow was set up at the outer Side of the Village, and when
I came near to it, there were sixteen or seventeen Creatures, whether
Men or Women, I could not tell, for they make no Distinction by
their Habits, either of Body or Head : These lay all flat on the Ground,
round this formidable Block of shapeless Wood: I saw no Motion
among them any more than if they had been all Logs of Wood like
the Idol, and at first, really thought they had been so; but when I
came a little nearer, they started up upon their Feet, and raised a
howling Cry, as if it had been so many deep-mouthed Hounds, and
walked away as if they were displeas'd at our disturbing them:
A little way off from the Idol, and at the Door of that Terit or Hut,
made all of Sheep-Skins and Cow-Skins, dried, stood three Butchers,
I thought they were such; when I came nearer to them, I found they
had long Knives in their Hands, and in the middle of the Tent ap-
pear'd three Sheep killed, and one young Bullock or Steer: These
it seems, were Sacrifices to that senseless Log of an Idol, and these
three Men, Priests belonging to it; and the seventeen prostrated
Wretches were the People who brought the Offering, and were
making their Prayers to that Stock.
I confess I was more moved at their Stupidity and brutish Wop
ship of a Hobgoblin, than ever I was at anything in my Life; to see
God's most glorious and best Creature, to whom he had granted so
many Advantages, even by Creation, above the rest of the Works of
his Hands, vested with a reasonable Soul, and that Soul adorn'd with
Faculties and Capacities, adapted both to honour his Maker, and be
honour'd by him, sunk and degenerated to a Degree so more than
stupid, as to prostrate itself to a frightful Nothing, a mere imaginary
Object dressed up by themselves, and made terrible to themselves by
their own Contrivance; adorn'd only with Clouts and Rags ; and that
this should be the Effect of mere Ignorance, wrought up into hellish
Devotion by the Devil himself; who envying (to his Maker) the
Homage and Adoration of his Creatures, had deluded them into such
gross, surfeiting, sordid, and brutish things, as one would think
should shock Nature itself.
But what signify'd all the Astonishment and Reflection of Thoughts?
thus it was, and I saw it before my Eyes, and there was no room to
wonder at it, or think it impossible; all my Admiration turned tc
Rage, and I rid up to the Image, or Monster, call it what you will, and
with my Sword cut the Bonnet that was on its Head in two in the
middle, so that it hung down by one of the Horns; and one of our
Men that was with me took hold of the Sheep-Skin that cover'd it, and
pulled at it, when behold a most hideous Outcry and Howling run
through the Village, and two or three hundred People came about my
Ears, so that I was glad to scour for it; for we saw some had Bows
and Arrows; but I resolv'd from that moment to visit them again.
Our Caravan rested three Nights at the Town, which was about
four Miles off, in order to provide some Horses which they wanted,
several of the Horses having been lamed, and jaded with the badness
of the Way and long March over the last Desert; so we had some
Leisure here to put my Design in Execution: I communicated my
Project to the Scots Merchant of Moscow, of whose Courage I had
had sufficient Testimony, as above: I told him what I had seen, and
with what Indignation I had since thought that human Nature could
be so degenerate: I told him, I was resolv'd if I could get but four or
five Men well armed to go with me, I was resolv'd to go and destroy
that vile, abominable Idol, and let them see that it had no Power to
help itself, and consequently could not be an Object of Worship, or
be prayed to, much less help them that offer'd Sacrifices to it
He laughed at me; says he, Your Zeal may be good, but what do
you propose to yourself by it? Propose, said I, to vindicate the
Honour of God, which is insulted by this Devil Worship. But how
will it vindicate the Honour of God ? said /u. While the People will
not be able to know what you mean by it, unless you could speak to
them and tell them so, and then they will fight you, and beat you too,
I'll assure you, for they are desperate Fellows, and that especially is
Defence of their Idolatry. Can we not, said I, do it in the Night,
and then leave them the Reasons and Causes in Writing in their own
Language? Writing! said he, why there is not a Man in five Nations
of them that know anything of a Letter, or how to read a Word in any
Language, or in their own. Wretched Ignorance! said I to him;
however I have a great mind to do it; perhaps Nature may draw In-
ferences from it to them, to let them see how brutish they are, to wor-
ship such horrid Things. Look you, Sir, said he, if your Zeal prompts
you to it so warmly, you must do it; but in the next place I would have
you consider, these wild Nations of People are subjected by Force to
the Czar of Muscovy's Dominions, and if you do this, it is ten to one
but they will come by Thousands to the Governor of Nortsinskoy,
and complain, and demand Satisfaction; and if he cannot give them
Satisfaction, it is ten to one but they revolt, and will occasion a new
War with all the Tartars in the Country.
This, I confess, put new Thoughts into my Head for a while; but
I harped upon the same String still, and all that Day I was uneasy to
put my Project in Execution: Towards the Evening the Scots Merchant
met me by Accident in our Walk about the Town, and desir'd to
speak with me; I believe, said he, I have put you off of your good
Design; I have been a little concern'd about it since, for I abhor the
Idol and the Idolatry as much as you can do: Truly, says I, you have
put it off a little as to the Execution of it, but you have not put it all
out of my Thoughts, and I believe I shall do it still before I quit this
Place, though I were to be deliver'd up to them for Satisfaction. N o,
no, says he, God forbid they should deliver you up to such a Crew of
Monsters; they shall not do that neither, that would be murdering
you indeed. Why, says I, how would they use me? Use you! says
he; I'll tell you how they served a poor Russian, who affronted them
in their Worship just as you did, and who they took Prisoner; after
they had lamed him with an Arrow that he could not run away, they
took him and stripped him stark naked, and set him up on the top of
the Idol Monster, and stood all around him, and shot as many Arrows
into him as would stick over his whole Body, and then they burnt
him and all the Arrows sticking in him as a Sacrifice to the Idol.
And was this the same Idol? Yes, says he, the very same. Well,
tays I, I'll tell you a Story; so I related the Story of our Men at
Madagascar, and how they burnt and sacked the Village there, and
killed Man, Woman, and Child, for their murdering one of our Men,
just as it is related before; and when I had done, I added, that I
thought we ought to do so to this Village.
He listen'd very attentively to the Story; but when I talked of
doing so to that Village, says he, You mistake very much, it was not
*his Village, it was almost a hundred Mile from this place, but it was
the same Idol, for they carry him about in Procession all over the

ADVENTURES OF
Country: Well, then, says I, then that Idol ought to be punish'tl foi
it, and it shall, says I, if I live this Night out
In a word, finding me resolute, he liked the Design, and told me
I should not go alone, but he would go with me, and bring a stout
Fellow, one of his Countrymen, to go also with us; and one, says he,
as famous for his Zeal as you can desire any one to be, against such
Devilish things as these. In a word, he brought me his Comrade, a
Scotsman, whom he called Captain Richardson, and I gave him a full
account of what I had seen; and in a word, of what I intended;
and he told me readily, he would go with me if it cost him his Life;
so we agreed to go only us three. I had indeed propos'd it to my
Partner, but he declin'd it; he said, he was ready to assist me to the
utmost, and upon all occasions for my defence; but that this was an
Adventure quite out of his Way; so, I say, we resolv'd upon our
Work only us three and my Man-Servant, and to put it in Execution
that Night about Midnight, with all the Secrecy imaginable.
However, upon second Thoughts, we were willing to delay it till
the next Night, because the Caravan being to set forward in the
Morning, we suppos'd the Governor could not pretend to give them
any Satisfaction upon us when we were out of his Power. The Scots
Merchant, as steady in his Resolution for the Enterprise, as bold in
executing, brought me a Tartar's Robe or Gown of the Sheep-Skins,
and a Bonnet, with a Bow and Arrows, and had provided the same
for himself and his Countryman, that the People, if they saw us,
should not be able to determine who we were.
All the first Night we spent in mixing up some combustible Matter
with Aqua-viUe, Gunpowder, and such other Materials as we could
get, and having a good Quantity of Tar in a little Pot, about an
Hour after Night we set out upon our Expedition.
We came to the Place about eleven o'Clock at Night, and found
that the People had not the least Jealousy of Danger attending their
Idol: the Night was cloudy, yet the Moon gave us Light enough to
see that the Idol stood just in the same Posture and Place that it did
before: The People seemed to be all at their Rest, only, that in the
great Hut, or Tent, as we called it, where we saw the three Priests,
whom we mistook for Butchers, we saw a Light, and going up close
to the Door, we heard People talking, as if there were five or six of
them; we concluded therefore, that if we set the Wild-nre to the
idol, these Men would come out immediately, and run up to t^e
Place to fescue it from the Destruction that we intended for it, and
what to do with them we knew not; once we thought of carrying it
away and setting Fire to it at a Distance; but when we came to
handle it, we found it too bulky for our Carriage, so we were at a
Loss again: The second Scotsman was for setting Fire to the Tent
or Hut, and knocking the Creatures that were there on the Head
when they came out; but I could not join with that; I was against
killing them, if it was possible to be avoided: Well then, said the
Scots Merchant, I'll tell you what we will do, we will try to take them
Prisoners, tie their Hands behind them, and make them stand still,
and see their Idol destroy'd.
As it happen'd, we had Twine or Packthread enough about us,
which was used to tie our Fire-Works together; so we resolv'd to
attack these People first, and with as little Noise as we could: The
first Thing we did, we knocked at the Doer, which issued just as we
desir'd it; for one of their Idol Priests came to the Door: we imme-
diately seized upon him, stopped his Mouth, and tied his Hands
behind him, and led him to the Idol, where we gagged him, that he
might not make a Noise; tied his Feet also together, and left him on
the Ground.
Two of us then waited at the Door, expecting that another would
come out to see what the Matter was; but we waited so long till the
third Man came back to us; and then nobody coming out, we
knocked again gently, and immediately out came two more, and we
served them just in the same manner, but were oblig'd to go all with
them, and lay them down by the Idol some Distance from one
another; when going back, we found two more were come out to the
Door, and a third more stood behind them within the Door: We seized
the two, and immediately tied them, when the third stepping back,
and crying out, my Scots Merchant went in after him, and taking out
a Composition we had made, that would only smoke and stink, he
set Fire to it, and threw it in among them; by that Time the other
Scotsman and my Man taking Charge of the two Men who were
already bound, and tied together also by the Arm, led them away to
the Idol, and left them there, to see if their Idol would relieve them
making Haste back to us.
When the Fuze we had thrown in had filled the Hut with so much
Smoke that they were almost suffocated, we then threw in a small
Leather Bag of another Kind, which flamed like a Candle, and
following it in, we found there was but four People left, who, ft seems,
were two Men and two Women; and, as we suppos'd, had been
about some of their Diabolic Sacrifices: They appear'd, in short;
frighted to Death, at least so as to sit trembling and stupid, and not
able to speak neither, for the Smoke.
In a word, we took them, bound them as we had the other, and
all without any Noise: I should have said, we brought them out of
the House or Hut first; for indeed we were not able to bear the
Smoke any more than they were. When we had done this, we
carry'd them all together to the Idol: when we came there, we fell
to work with him; and first we daubed him all over, and his Robes
also, with Tar and such other Stuff as we had, which was Tallow
mixed with Brimstone; then we stopped his Eyes, and Ears, and Mouth
full of Gunpowder, and then we wrapped up a great piece of Wild-
fire in his Bonnet, and then sticking all the Combustibles we had
brought with us upon him, we looked about to see if we could find
anything else to help to burn him, when my Man remember'd, that
by the Tent or Hut where the Men were, there lay a heap of dry
Forage, whether Straw or Rushes I do not remember; away he and
one of the Scotsmen run, and fetched their Arms full of that: When
we had done this, we took all our Prisoners, and brought them,
having unty'd their Feet, and ungagg'd their Mouths, and made them
stand up, and set them just before their monstrous Idol, and then
set fire to the whole.
We stayed by it a quarter of an Hour, or thereabouts, till the
Powder in the Eyes, and Mouth, Fjid Ears of the Idol blew up, and
we could perceive had split and deform'd the Shape; and in a word,
till we saw it burn into a mere Block or Log of Wood: and then
setting the dry Forage to it, we found it would be quite consumed,
when we began to think of going away; but the Scotsman said no, we
must not go, for these poor deluded Wretches will all throw them-
selves into the Fire, and burn themselves with the Idol; so we re-
solv'd to stay till the Forage was burnt down too, and then we came
away and left them.
In the Morning we appear'd among our Fellow Travellers exceed-
ing busy, in getting ready for our Journey; nor could any Man
suggest that we had been anywhere but in our Beds, as Travellers
might be suppos'd to be, to fit themselves for the Fatigues of thai
Day's Journey.
But it did not end so; the next Day came a great Multitude of
the Country People, not only of this Village, but of a hundred more,
for aught I know, to the Town-Gates, and in a most outrageous
manner, demanded Satisfaction of the Russian Governor, for the in-
sulting their Priests, and burning their Great Cham-Chi-Thaungu;
such a hard Name they gave the monstrous Creature they worshipp'd;
the People of Nortsinskoy were at first in a great Consternation, for
they said, the Tartars were no less than thirty thousand, and that in
a few Days more, vrauld be one hundred thousand strong.
The Russian Governor sent out Messengers to appease them, and
gave them all the good words imaginable: He assur'd them, he
knew nothing of it, and that there had not a Soul of his Garrison been
abroad: that it could not be from anybody there; and if they would
let him know who it was, they should be exemplarily punish'd. They
/eturn'd haughtily, that all the Country reverenc'd the Great Cham-
Chi-Thaungu,Y?ho dwelt in the Sun, and no Mortal would have decreed
to offer Violence to his Image, but some Christian Miscreant, so they
called them, it seems; and they therefore denounc'd War against
him, and all the Russians, who, they said, were Miscreants and
Christians.
The Governor still patient, and unwilling to make a Breach, or to
have any Cause of War alleged to be given by him, the Czar having
straitly charged them to treat the conquer'd Country with Gentleness
and Civility, gave them still all the good Words he could; at last he
told them, there was a Caravan gone towards Russia that Morning,
and perhaps it was some of them, who had done them this Injury;
and that if they would be satisfied with that, he would send after them,
to inquire into it: This seemed to appease them a little; and accord-
ingly the Governor sent after us, and gave us a particular Account
how the Thing was; intimating withal, that if any in our Caravan had
done it, they should make their Escape; but that whether they had
done it or no, we should make all the haste forward that was possible
and that in the meantime he would keep them in play as long as he
could.
This was very friendly in the Governor; however, when it came to
the Caravan, there was nobody knew anything of the Matter. And
as for us that were guilty, we were the least of all suspected; none so
much as asked us the Question; however, the Captain of the Caravar
tor tne Time, took Uie Hint that the Governor g»ve us, and we
marched or travell'd two Days and two Nights, without any consider-
able Stop; and then we lay at a Village called Plothus; nor did
make any long Stop here, but hasten'd on towards Jarawena, another
of the Czar of Muscovy's Colonies, and where we expected we should
be safe; but it is to be observ'd, that here we began for two or three
Days' March, to enter upon the vast nameless Desert, of which I shall
say more in its Place; and which, if we had now been upon it, it is
more than probable, we had been all destroy'd: It was the second
Day's March from Plothus, that by the Clouds of Dust behind us at
a great Distance, some of our People began to be sensible we were
pursu'd ; we had enter'd the Desert, and had passed by a great Lake
called, Sehaks-Oser, when we perceiv'd a very great Body of Horse
appear on the other Side of the Lake to the North, we travelling West:
We observ'd they went away West as we did, but had suppos'd we
would have taken that Side of the Lake, whereas, we very happily
took the South Side; and in two Days more, we saw them not, for
tbey believing we were still before them, pushed on till they came to
the river Udda; this is a very great River when it passes farther
North; but where we came to it, we found it narrow, and fordable.
The third Day they either found their Mistake, or had Intelligence
of us, and came pouring in upon us, towards the Dusk of the Even-
ing: We had, to our great Satisfaction, just pitched upon a Place for
our Camp, which was very convenient for the Night; for as we were
upon a Desert, though but at the beginning of it, that was above five
hundred Miles over, we had no Towns to lodge at, and indeed ex-
pected none but the City Jarawena, which we had yet two Days'
March to; the Desert however, had some few Woods in it on this
Side, and little Rivers, which ran all into the great river Udda: It was
in a narrow Strait between two little, but very thick Woods, that we
pitched our little Camp for that Night, expecting to be attack'd in the
Night
Nobody knew but ourselves, what we were pursu'd for; but as it
was usual for the Mongol Tartars to go about in Troops in that Desert,
so the Caravans always fortify themselves every Night against them,
as against Armies of Robbers; and it was therefore no new thing to
be pursu'd.
But we had this Night, of all the Nights of our Travels, a most
advantageous Camp; for we lay between two Woods, with a littl<
Rivulet running just before our Front; so that we could not be sup
rounded, or attack'd any way, but in our Front or Rear; we took
care also to make our Front as strong as we could, by placing our
Packs, with our Camels and Horses, all in a Line on the Inside of
the River, and felling some Trees in our Rear.
In this Posture we encamp'd for the Night, but the Enemy was
upon us before we had finish'd our Situation: They did not come on
us like Thieves as we expected, but sent three Messengers to us, to
demand the Men to be deliver'd to them, that had abus'd their
Priests, and burnt their God, Cham- Chi-Thaungu with Fire, that they
might bur n them with Fire; and upon this, they said they would go
away, and do us no farther harm: otherwise, they would burn us all
with Fire. Our Men looked very blank at this Message, and began to
stare at one another, to see who looked with most Guilt in their Faces;
but nobody war< the Word, nobody did it The Leader of the Caravan
sent Word, he was well assur'd, it was not done by any of our Camp;
that we were peaceable Merchants, travelling on our Business; that
we had done no harm to them, or to any one else; and that there-
fore, they must look farther for their Enemies who had injur'd them,
for we were not the People; so desir'd them not to disturb us, for
if they did, we should defend ourselves.
They were far from being satisfy'd with this for an Answer, but a
great Crowd of them came down in the Morning by break of Day to
our Camp; but seeing us in such an unaccountable Situation, they
durst come no farther than the Brook in our Front, where they
stood and showed us such a Number, that indeed terrify'd us very
much; for those that spoke least of them, spoke of ten thousand:
here they stood and looked at us a while, and then setting up a great
Howl, they let fly a Crowd of Arrows among us; but we were wel
enough fortify'd for that; for we shelter'd under our Baggage, and I
do not remember that one Man of us was hurt
Some Time after this, we see them move a little to our Right, and
expected them on the Rear, when a cunning Fellow, a Cossack, as
they call them, of Jarawena, in the Pay of the Muscovites, calling to
the Leader of the Caravan, said to him, I'll go send all these People
away to Siheilka; this was a City, four or five Days' Journey at least
to the South, and rather behind us: so he takes his Bow and Arrows,
and getting on Horse-back, he rides away from our Rear directly, as
it were back to Nortszinskoy; after this, he takes a great Circu't
about, and comes to the Army of the Tartars, as if he had been sent
Express to tell them a long Story; that the People who had burnt
the Cham-Chi-TJiaungu, were gone to Siheilka, with a Caravan of
Miscreants, as he called them, that is to say, Christians; and that they
had resolv'd to burn the God Schal-Isar, belonging to the Tongueses.
As this Fellow was himself a mere Tartar, and perfectly spoke
their Language, he counterfeited so well, that they all took it from
him, and away they drove in a most violent Hurry to Siheilka, which
it seems was five Days' Journey to the North, and in less than three
Hours, they were entirely out of our Sight, and we never heard any
more of them; and we never knew whether they went to that other
Place called Siheilka, or no.
So we passed safely on to the City of Jarawena, where there was
a Garrison of Muscovites, and there we rested five Days, the Caravan
being exceedingly fatigu'd with the last Day's hard march, and with
want of Rest in the Night
From this City we had a frightful Desert, which held us three and
twenty Days' March: We farnish'd ourselves with some Tents here,
for the better accommodating ourselves in the Night; and the Leader
of the Caravan procured sixteen Carriages or Waggons of the Country,
for carrying our Water and Provisions, and these Carriages were our
Defence every Night round our little Camp; so that had the Tartars
ippear'd, unless they had been very numerous indeed, they would not
have been able to hurt us.
We may well be suppos'd to want Rest again after this long
Journey; for in this Desert we saw neither House or Tree, or scarce
a Bush; we saw abundance of the Sable-Hunters, as they call'd them:
These are all Tartars of the Mongol Tartary, of which this Country is
i part, and they frequently attack small Caravans, but we saw no
Numbers of them together: I was curious to see the Sable Skins they
catched, but could never speak with any of them, for they durst not
come near us, neither durst we straggle from our Company, to go
near them.
After we had passed this Desert we came into a Country pretty
well inhabited; that is to say, we found Towns and Castles, settled
by the Czar of Muscovy, with Garrisons of Stationary Soldiers to pro-
tect the Caravans, and defend the Country against the Tartars, who
would otherwise make it very dangerous travelling; and his Czarish
Majesty has given such strict Orders for the well guarding the Cara
vans and Merchants, that if there are any Tartars heard of in the
Country, Detachments of the Garrisons are always sent to see the
Travellers safe from Station to Station.
And thus the Governor of Adinskoy, who I had Opportunity to
make a Visit to, by means of the Scots Merchant who was acquainted
with him, offer'd us a Guard of 50 Men, if we thought there was any
Danger, to the next Station.
I thought long before this, that as we came nearer to Europe we
should find the Country better peopled, and the People more civi-
liz'd, but I found myself mistaken in both, for we had yet the Nation
of the Tongueses to pass through; where we saw the same Tokens of
Paganism and Barbarity, or worse, than before, only as they were
conquer'd by the Muscovites, and entirely reduc'd, they were not so
dangerous; but for Rudeness of Manners, Idolatry, and Multitheism
no People in the World ever went beyond them: They are clothed
all in Skins of Beasts, and their Houses are built of the same: You
know not a Man from a Woman, neither by the Ruggedness of their
Countenances or their Clothes; and in the Winter, when the Ground
is cover'd with Snow, they live under Ground in Houses like Vaults,
which have Cavities going from one to another.
If the Tartars had their Cham-Chi-Thaungu for a whole Village or
Country, these had Idols in every Hut and in every Cave; besides,
they worship the Stars, the Sun, the Water, the Snow, and in a word,
everything that they do not understand, and they understand but very
little; so that almost every Element, every uncommon thing, sets
them a sacrificing.
But I am no more to describe People than Countries, any farther
than my own Story comes to be concern'd in them: I met with
nothing peculiar to myself in all this Country, which I reckon was from
the Desert which I spoke of last, at least 400 Miles, half of it being
another Desert, which took us up 12 Days' severe travelling, without
House, or Tree, or Bush, but were oblig'd again to carry our own
Provisions, as well Water as Bread. After we were out of this Desert,
and had travell'd two Days, we came to Janezay, a Muscovite City or
Station, on the great River Janezay: this River they told us parted
Europe from Asia, though our Map-makers, as I am told, do not
agree to it; however, it is certainly the Eastern Boundary of th«
ancient Siberia, which now makes up a Province only of the vast
Muscovite Empire, but is itself equal in Bigness to the whole Empir«
of Germany.
And yet here I observ'd Ignorance and Paganism still prevail'd,
except in the Muscovite Gairisons; all the Country between the River
Oby and the River Janezay is as entirely Pagan, and the People as
barbarous, as the remotest of the Tartars, nay, as any Nation, for
aught I know in Asia or America: I also found, which I observ'd
to the Muscovite Governors whom I had Opportunity to converse
with, that the poor Pagans are not much the wiser or the nearer
Christianity for being under the Muscovite Government; which they
acknowledg'd was true enough, but, as they said, was none of their
Business: That if the Czar expected to convert his Siberian, or
Tonguese, or Tartar Subjects, it should be done by sending Clergy-
men among them, not Soldiers; and they added, with more Sincerity
than I expected, that they found it was not so much the Concern of
their Monarch to make the People Christians, as it was to make them
Subjects.
From this River to the great River Oby, we crossed a wild
uncultivated Country: I cannot say it is a barren Soil; it is only
barren of People, and good Management, otherwise it is in itself a
most pleasant, fruitful and agreeable Country: What Inhabitants we
found in it are all Pagans, except such as are sent among them from
Russia; for this is the Country, I mean on both sides the River Oby,
whither the Muscovite Criminals, that are not put to Death, ara
banish'd, and from whence it is next to impossible they should ever
come away.
I have nothing material to say of my particular Affairs, till I came
to Tobolski, the Capital City of Siberia, where I continu'd some time
on the following Occasion.
We had been now almost seven Months on our Journey, and
Winter began to come on apace; whereupon my Partner and I called
a Council about our particular Affairs, in which we found it proper,
considering that we were bound for England, and not for Moscow, to
consider how to dispose of ourselves: They told us of Sledges and
Rein Deer to carry us over the Snow in the Winter time; and indeed
they have such things, that it would be incredible to relate the
Particulars of, by which means the Russions travel more in the
Winter than they can in Summer, because in these Sledges they
are able to run Night and Day; the Snow being frozen, is
one universal Covering to Nature, by which the Hills, the Vales,
the Rivers, the Lakes, all are smooth, and hard as a Stone, and
they run upon the Surface, without any regard to what is under
neath.
But I had no occasion to push at a Winter Journey of this kind:
I was bound to England, not to Moscow, and my Route lay two ways,
either I must go on as the Caravan went till I came to Jeroslaw, and
then go off West for Narva, and the Gulf of Finland; and so either
by Sea or Land to Dantzic, where I might possibly sell my China
Cargo to good Advantage, or I must leave the Caravan at a littie
Town on the Dwina, from whence I had but six Days by Water to
Archangel, and from thence might be sure of Shipping, either to
England, Holland, or Hamburgh.
Now to go any of these Journeys in the Winter, would have been
preposterous; for as to Dantzic, the Baltic would be frozen up, and
I could not get Passage, and to go by Land in those Countries, was
far less safe than among the Mongol Tartars; likewise to go to Arch-
angel in October, all the Ships would be gone from thence, and even
the Merchants who dwell there in Summer, retire South to Moscow in
the Winter when the Ships are gone; so that I should have nothing
but Extremity of Cold to encounter, with a Scarcity of Provisions,
and must lie there in an empty Town all the Winter: so that upon
the whole I thought it much my better way to let the Caravan go, and
to make Provision to winter where I was, (viz.) at Tobolski in Siberia,
in the Latitude of 60 Degrees, where I was sure of three Things to
wear out a cold Winter with, (viz.) Plenty of Provision such as the
Country afforded; a warm House, with Fuel enough, and excellent
Company; of all which I shall give a full Account in its Place.
I was now in a quite different Climate from my belov'd Island,
where I never felt Cold except when I had my Ague; on the con-
trary, I had much to do to bear any Clothes on my Back, and never
made any Fire but without Doors, and for my necessity in dressing
my Food, Grc. Now I made me three good Vests, with large Robes
or Gowns over them to hang down to the Feet, and button close to
the Wrists, and all these lined with Furs to make them sufficiently
warm.
As to a warm House, I must confess I greatly dislik'd our way in
England of making Fires in every Room in the House, in open
Chimneys, which when the Fire was out, always kept the Air in the
Room cold as the Climate: But taking an Apartment in a good
House in the Town, I order'd a Chimney to be built like a Furnace,
in the centre of six several Rooms, like a Stove, the Funnel to carry
the Smoke went up one Way, the Door to come at the Fire went in
another, and all the Rooms were kept equally warm, but no Fire
seen; just as they heat the Bagnios in England.
By this means we had always the same Climate in all the Rooms,
and an equal Heat was preserv'd; and how cold soever it was with-
out, it was always warm within, and yet we saw no Fire, nor were in-
commoded with any Smoke.
The most wonderful thing of all was, that it should be possible to
meet with good Company here, in a Country so barbarous as that of
the most Northerly Parts of Europe, near the frozen Ocean, and within
but a very few Degrees of Nova Zembla.
But this being the Country where the State Criminals of Muscovy,
as I observ'd before, are all banish'd, this City was full of Noblemen,
Princes, Gentlemen, Colonels, and in short all Degrees of the
Nobility, Gentry, Soldiery, and Courtiers of Muscovy: Here was the
famous Prince Galliozen, the old General Robostiski, and several other
Persons of Note, and some Ladies.
By means of my Scots Merchant, whom nevertheless I parted with
here, I made an Acquaintance here with several of these Gentlemen,
and some of them of the first Rank, and from these in the long
Winter Nights in which I stay'd here, I receiv'd very agreeable Visits:
It was talking one Night with Prince one of the banish'd
Ministers of State, belonging to the Czar of Muscovy, that my Talk of
my particular Case began: He had been telling me abundance of
fine Things of the Greatness, the Magnificence, the Dominions, and
the absolute Power of the Emperor of the Russians. I interrupted
him, and told him I was a greater and more powerful Prince than ever
the Czar of Muscovy was, though my Dominions were not so large, or
my People so many. The Russian Grandee looked a little surpris'd,
and fixing his Eyes steadily upon me, began to wonder what I meant
/ told him, his Wonder would cease when I had explain'd myself:
First, I told him, I had the absolute Disposal of the Lives and Fortunes
of all my Subjects: That notwithstanding my absolute Power, I had
not one Person disaffected to my Government, or to my Person, in all
my Dominions. He shook his Head at that, and said, there indeed
I outdid the Czar of Muscovy. I told him, That all the Lands in my
Kingdom were my own, and all my Subjects were not only my
Tenants, but Tenants at Will: That they would all fight for me to
the last Drop; and that never Tyrant, for such I acknowledged myself
to be, was ever so universally belov'd, and yet so horribly feared by
his Subjects.
After amusing them with these Riddles in Government for a while,
I opened the Case, and told them the Story at large of my living in.
the Island, and how I manag'd both myself and the People there
that were under me, just as I have since minuted it down. They were
exceedingly taken with the Story, and especially the Prince, who told
me with a Sigh, that the true Greatness of Life was to be Master of
ourselves: That he would not have exchang'd such a State of Life
as mine, to have been Czar of Muscovy; and that he found more
Felicity in the Retirement he seemed to be banish'd to there, than ever
he found in the highest Authority he enjoy'd in the Court of his
Master the Czar: That the Height of human Wisdom was to bring
. our Tempers down to our Circumstances; and to make a Calm with-
in, under the Weight of the greatest Scorns without When he came
first hither, he said he used to tear the Hair from his Head, and the
Clothes from his Back, as others had done before him; but a little
Time and Consideration had made him look into himself, as well as
round him to things without: That he found the Mind of Man, if
it was but once brought to reflect upon the State of universal Life,
and how little this World was concern'd in its true Felicity, was per-
fectly capable of making a Felicity for itself, fully satisfying to itself,
and suitable to its own best Ends and Desires, with but very little
Assistance from the World: That Air to breathe in, Food to sustain
Life, Clothes for Warmth, and Liberty for Exercise in Order to
Health, completed, in his Opinion, all that the World could do for
us; and though the Greatness, the Authority, the Riches, and the
Pleasures which some enjoy'd in the World, and which he had enjoy'd
his Share of, had much in them that was agreeable to us; yet he
observ'd that all those things chiefly gratify'd the coarsest of our
Affections, such as our Ambition, our particular Pride, our Avarice,
our Vanity, and our Sensuality; all which were indeed the mere Pro-
duct of the worst part of Man, were in themselves Crimes, and had in
them the Seeds of all Manner of Crimes, but neither were related to,
or concern'd with any of those Virtues that constituted us wise Men,
or of those Graces which distinguish'd us as Christians: That being
now depriv'd of all the fancied Felicity which he enjoy'd in the full
Exercise of all those Vices, he said he was at Leisure to look upon
the dark Side of them, where he found all manner of Deformity, and
was now convinc'd, that Virtue only makes a Man truly wise, rich,
and great, and preserves him in the way to a superior Happiness in a
future State. And in this he said, they were more happy in their
Banishment, than all their Enemies were, who had the full Possession
of all the Wealth and Power that they (the Banish'd) had left behind
them.
Nor, Sir, says he, do I bring my Mind to this politically, by the
Necessity of my Circumstances, which some call miserable; but if I
know anything of myself, I would not now go back, though the Czar,
my Master, should call me, and re-instate me in all my former
Grandeur; I say, I would no more go back to it, than I believe my
Soul, when it shall be deliver'd from this Prison of the Body, and has
had a Taste of the glorious State beyond Life, would come back to
the Jail of Flesh and Blood it is now enclos'd in, and leave Heaven
to deal in the Dirt and Crime of human Affairs.
He spoke this with so much Warmth in his Temper, so much
Earnestness and Motion of his Spirits, which were apparent in his
Countenance, that it was evident it was the true Sense of his Soul:
There was no room to doubt his Sincerity.
I told him, I once thought myself a kind of a Monarch in my old
Station, of which I had given him an Account, but that I thought he
was not a Monarch only, but a great Conqueror; for that he that has
got a Victory over his own exorbitant Desires, and has the absolute
Dominion over himself, whose Reason entirely governs his Will, is
certainly greater than he that conquers a City. But, my Lord, said I,
shall I take the Liberty to ask you a Question? With all my Heart,
says he. If the Door of your Liberty was opened, said I, would you
not take hold of it to deliver yourself from this Exile?
Hold, said he, your Question is subtle, and requires some serious
just Distinctions, to give it a sincere Answer; and I'll give it you
from the Bottom of my Heart Nothing that I know of in this
World would move me to deliver myself from this State of Banish-
ment, except these two, First, the Enjoyment of my Relations, and
Secondly, a little warmer Climate; but I protest to you, that to go
back to the Pomp of the Court, the Glory, the Power, the Hurry of a
Minister of State, the Wealth, the Gaiety, and the Pleasures, that is to
say, Follies of a Courtier; if my Master should send me Word this
Moment, that he restores me to all he banish'd me from; I protest
r/Tknow myself at all, I would not leave this Wilderness, these
Deserts, and these frozen Lakes, for the Palace at Moscow.
But, my Lord, said I, perhaps you not only are banish'd from the
Pleasures of the Court, and from the Power, and Authority, and
tVealth you enjoy'd before, but you may be absent too from some of
the Conveniences of Life, your Estate perhaps confiscated and your
Effects plunder'd, and the Supplies left you here may not be suitable
to the ordinary Demands of Life.
Ay, says he, that is as you suppose me to be a Lord, or a Prince,
6v. So indeed I am; but you are now to consider me only as a
Man, a human Creature, not at all distinguish'd from another, and so
I can suffer no Want, unless I should be visited with Sickness and
Distempers. However, to put the Question out of Dispute; you see
our Manner; we are in this Place five Persons of Rank ; we live per-
fectly retir'd, as suited to a State of Banishment; we have some-
thing rescu'd from the Shipwreck of our Fortunes, which keeps us
from the mere Necessity of hunting for our Food; but the poor
Soldiers who are here, without that Help, live in as much Plenty as
we, who go into the Woods and catch Sables and Foxes ; the Labour
of a Month will maintain them a Year; and as the Way of living is
not expensive, so it is not hard to get sufficient to ourselves. So that
Objection is out of Doors.
I have not room to give a full Account of the most agreeable Con-
versation I had with this truly great Man; in all which he showed,
that his Mind was so inspir'd with a superior Knowledge of Things,
so supported by Religion, as well as by a vast Share of Wisdom;
that his Contempt of the World, was really as much as he had ex-
press'd, and that he was always the same to the last, as will appear in
the Story I am going to tell.
I had been here 8 Months, and a dark dreadful Winter I thought
it to be, the Cold so intense, that I could not so much as look abroad
without being wrapt in Furs, and a Mask of Fur before my Face, or
rather a Hood with only a Hole for Breath, and two for Sight: The
little Daylight we had, was, as we reckon'd, for three Months, not
above five Hours a Day, and six at most; only that the Snow lying
on the Ground continually, and the Weather clear, it was never quite
dark: Our Horses were kept (or rather starved) under Ground, and
as for our Servants, for we hired three Servants here to look after
our Horses and selves, we had every now and then their Fingers
wd Toes to thaw and take care of, lest they should mortify and
tall off.
It is true, within Doors we were warm, the Houses being close, the
Walls thick, the Lights small, and the Glass all double; our Food
was chiefly the flesh of Deer dried and cured in the Season; good
Bread enough, but baked as Biscuits; dried Fish of several Sorts, and
some Flesh of Mutton, and of the Buffaloes, which is pretty good
Beef: All the Stores of Provisions for the Winter are laid up in the
Summer, and well cured; our Drink was Water mixed with Aqua-
vits instead of Brandy, and for a Treat, Mead instead of Wine,
which, however, they have excellent good: The Hunters, who venture
abroad all Weathers, frequently brought us in fresh Venison, very fat
and good, and sometimes Bear's Flesh, but we did not much care for
the last: We had a good Stock of Tea, with which we treated our
Friends, as above; and in a word, we lived very cheerfully and well,
all things consider'd.
It was now March, and the Days grown considerably longer, and
the Weather, at least, tolerable; so the other Travellers began to pre-
pare Sleds to carry them over the Snow, and to get things ready tc
be going; but my Measures being fixed, as I have said, for Arch-
angel, and not for Muscovy or the Baltic, I made no Motion; know-
ing very well that the Ships from the South do not set out for that
Part of the World till May ox June, and that if I was there by the
beginning of August, it would be as soon as any Ships would be ready
to go away; and therefore, I say, I made no haste to be gone, as others
did; in a Word, I saw a great many People, nay, all the Travellers go
away before me: It seems every Year they go from thence to Moscow
for Trade, (viz.) to carry Furs, and buy Necessaries with them, which
they bring back to furnish their Shops; also others went of the same
Errand to Archangel, but then they also being to come back again
above 800 Miles, went all out before me.
In short, about the latter end of May I began to make all ready to
pack up; and as I was doing this, it occurr'd to me, that seeing all
these People were banish'd by the Czar of Muscmy to Siberia, and yet
when they came there, were left at Liberty to go whither they would;
why did they not then go away to any Part of the World whereve!
they thought fit, and I began to examine what should hinder them
from making such an Attempt
But my Wonder was over, when I enter'd upon that Subject with
the Person I have mention'd, who answer'd me thus: Consider, First,
Sir, said he, the Place where we are; and Secondly, the Condition we
are in; especially, said he, the Generality of the People who are
banish'd hither; we are surrounded, said he, with stronger Things
than Bars and Bolts; on the North Side an unnavigable Ocean, where
Ship never sailed, and Boat never swam; neither, if we had both,
could we know where to go with them: Every other Way, said he,
we have above a Thousand Miles to pass through the Czar's own
Dominions, and Byways utterly unpassable, except by the Roads
made by the Governor, and by the Towns garrison'd by his Troops;
so that we could neither pass undiscover'd by the Road, or subsist
any other Way, so that it is in vain to attempt it
I was silenc'd indeed at once, and found that they were in a Prison,
every Jot as secure as if they had been locked up in the Castle at
Moscow; however, it came into my Thought, that I might certainly
be made an Instrument to procure the Escape of this excellent Person^
and that whatever Hazard I run, I would certainly try if I could
carry him off. Upon this I took an Occasion one Evening to tell him
my Thoughts: I represented to him, that it was very easy for me to
carry him away, there being no Guard over him in the Country, and
as I was not going to Moscow, but to Archangel, and that I went in
the nature of a Caravan, by which I was not oblig'd to lie in the
Stationary Towns in the Desert, but could encamp every Night where
I would, we might easily pass uninterrupted to Archangel, where I
would immediately secure him on Board an English or Dutch Ship,
and cany him off safe along with me; and as to his Subsistence, and
other Particulars, it should be my Care till he could better supply
himself.
He heard me very attentively, and looked earnestly on me all the
while I spoke; nay, I could see in his very Face, that what I said put
his Spirits into an exceeding Ferment; his Colour frequently changed,
his Eyes looked red, and his Heart flutter'd, that it might be even
perceiv'd in his Countenance; nor could he immediately answer me.
When I had done, and as it were expected what he would say to it,
after he had paused a little he embrac'd me, and said, How unhappy
are we, unguarded Creatures as we are, that even our greatest Acts of
Friendship are made Snares to us, and we are made Tempters of
one another! My dear Friend, said he, your Offer is so sincere, lias
such Kindness in it, is so disinterested in itself, and is so calculated
for my Advantage, that I must have very little Knowledge of the
World, if I did not both wonder at it, and acknowledge the Obligation
I have upon me to you for it But did you believe I was sincere in
what I have so often said to you of my Contempt of the World? Did
you believe I spoke my very Soul to you, and that I had really obtain'd
that Degree of Felicity here, that had placed me above all that the
World could give me, or do for me? Did you believe I was sin-
cere, when I told you I would not go back if I was recall'd, even to be
all that once I was in the Court with the Favour of the Czar my
Master? Did you believe me, my Friend, to be an honest Man, or did
you think me to be a boasting Hypocrite? Here he stopped, as if he
would hear what I would say, but indeed, I soon after perceiv'd that
he stopped because his Spirits were in Motion, his great Heart was
full of Struggles, and he could not go on. I was, I confess, astonish'd
at the thing as well as at the Man, and I used some Arguments with
him to urge him to set himself free: That he ought to look upon this
as a Door open'd by Heaven for his Deliverance, and a Summons by
Providence, who has the Care and Disposition of all Events, to do
himself good, and to render himself useful in the World.
He had by this Time recover'd himself: How do you know, Sir,
says he warmly, that instead of a Summons from Heaven, it may not
be a Feint of another Instrument? Representing in all the alluring
Colours to me the Show of Felicity as a Deliverance, which may in
itself be my Snare, and tend directly to my Ruin: Here I am free
from the Temptation of returning to my former miserable Greatness;
there I am not sure but that all the Seeds of Pride, Ambition,
Avarice and Luxury, which I know remain in Nature, may revive and
take Root, and in a Word, again overwhelm me, and then the happy
Prisoner, who you see now Master of his Soul's Liberty, shall be
the miserable Slave of his own Senses, in the Full of all personal
Liberty: Dear Sir, let me remain in this blessed Confinement,
banish'd from the Crimes of Life, rather than purchase a Show of
Freedom, at the Expense of the Liberty of my Reason, and at the
Expense of the future Happiness which now I have in my View, but
Bhall then, I fear, quickly lose Sight of; for I am but Flesh, a Man,
a mere Man, have Passions and Affections as likely to possess and
overthrow me as any Man: O be not my Friend and my Tempter
both together!
If I was surpris'd before. I was ouitc dumb now, and stood silent,
looking at him, and indeed admir'd at what I saw; the Struggle in
his Soul was so great, that though the Weather was extremely cold, it
put him into a most violent Sweat, and I found he wanted to give
Vent to his Mind; so I said a Word or two, that I would leave him
to consider of it, and wait on him again, and then I withdrew to my
own Apartment
About two Hours after I heard somebody at, or near, the Door of
my Room, and I was going to open the Door, but he had open'd it,
and came in: My dear Friend, says he, you had almost overset me,
but I am recover'd; do not take it ill that I do not close with your
Offer; I assure you, it is not for want of a Sense of the Kindness of
it in you, and I came to make the most sincere Acknowledgment of
it to you; but I hope I have got the Victory over myself.
My Lord, said I, I hope you are fully satisfy'd that you do not
resist the Call of Heaven. Sir, said he, if it had been from Heaven,
the same Power would have influenc'd me to accept it; but I hope,
and am fully satisfy'd, that it is from Heaven that I decline it, and I
have an infinite Satisfaction in the Parting, that you shall leave me an
honest Man still, though not a free Man.
I had nothing to do but to acquiesce, and make Professions to him
of my having no End in it but a sincere Desire to serve him: He
embrac'd me very passionately, and assur'd me, he was sensible of
that, and should always acknowledge it, and with that he offer'd me
a very fine Present of Sables, too much indeed for me to accept from
a Man in his Circumstances, and I would have avoided them, but he
would not be refus'd.
The next Morning I sent my Servant to his Lordship, with a small
Present of Tea, and two Pieces of China Damask, and four little
Wedges of Japan Gold, which did not all weigh above six Ounces, or
thereabout, but were far short of the Value of his Sables, which,
indeed, when I came to England, I found worth near 200/. He ac
cepted the Tea, and one Piece of the Damask, and one of the Pieces
of Gold, which had a fine Stamp upor.it, of the Japan Comage, which
I found he took for the Rarity of it, but would not take any more,
and he sent Word by my Servant that he desir'd to speak with me.
When I came to him, he told me, I knew what had passed between
us, and hoped I would not move him any more in that Affair; but
that since I had made such a generous Offer to him, he asked me, if
I had Kindness enough to offer the same to another Person that he
would name to me, in whom he had a great Share of Concern; 1
told him, that I could not say I inclin'd to do so much for any one
but himself, for whom I had a particular Value, and should kave been
glad to have been the Instrument of his Deliverance; however, if he
would please to name the Person to me, I would give him my Answer,
and hoped he would not be displeas'd with me, if he was with my
Answer; he told me, it was only his Son, who, though I had not
seen, yet was in the same Condition with himself, and above two
hundred Miles from him, on the other side the Oby; but that if I
consented, he would send for him.
I made no Hesitation, but told him I would do it: I made some
Ceremony in letting him understand that it was wholly on his
Account, and that seeing I could not prevail on him, I would show
my Respect to him, by my Concern for his Son; but these Things
are too tedious to repeat here: He sent away the next Day for his
Son, and in about twenty Days he came back with the Messenger,
bringing six or seven Horses, loaded with very rich Furs, and which
in the whole amounted to a very great Value.
His Servants brought the Horses into the Town, but left the young
Lord at a Distance, till Night, when he came incognito into our
Apartment, and his Father presented him to me; and in short, we
concerted there the Manner of our travelling, and everything proper
for the Journey.
I had bought a considerable Quantity of Sables, black Fox Skins,
fine Ermines, and such other Furs as are very rich; I say, I had
bought them in that City in Exchange for some of the Goods I
brought from China; in particular for the Cloves and Nutmegs, of
which I sold the greatest Part here, and the rest afterwards at Arch-
angel, for a much better Price than I could have done at London;
and my Partner who was sensible of the Profit, and whose Business
more particularly than mine was Merchandise, was mightily pleased
with our Stay, on Account of the Traffic we made here.
It was the beginning oljune when I left this remote Place, a City,
I believe, little heard of in the World; and indeed it is so far out of
the Road of Commerce, that I know not how it should be much
talked of. We were now come to a very small Caravan, being only
Siirty-two Horses and Camels in all, and all of them passed foi mine,
though my new Guest was Proprietor of eleven of them; it was most
natural also that I should take more Servants with me than I had
before, and the young Lord passed for my Steward; what great Man
I passed for myself, I know not, neither did it concern me to inquire;
we had here the worst and the largest Desert to pass over that we
met with in all the Journey; indeed I call it the worst, because the
Way was very deep in some Places, and very uneven in others; the
best we had to say for it was, that we thought we had no Troops
of Tartars and Robbers to fear, and that they never came on
this Side the River Oby, or at least but very seldom, but we found it
otherwise.
My young Lord had with him a faithful Muscovite Sen-ant, or
rather a Siberian Servant, who was perfectly acquainted with the
Country, and led us by private Roads, that we avoided coming in to
the principal Towns and Cities upon the great Road, such as Tumen,
Soly-Kamskoi, and several others; because the Muscovite Garrisons
which are kept there, are very curious and strict in their Observation
upon Travellers; and searching lest any of the banish'd Persons of
Note should make their escape that Way into Muscovy; but by this
Means, as we were kept out of the Cities, so our whole Journey was
a Desert, and we were oblig'd to encamp and lie in our Tents, when
we might have had very good Accommodation in the Cities on the
Way: This the young Lord was so sensible of, that he would not
allow us to lie abroad, when we came to several Cities on the Way,
but lay abroad himself with his Servant in the Woods, and met us
always at the appointed Places.
We were just enter'd Europe, having pass'd the River Kama, which
in these Parts is the Boundary between Europe and Asia, and the
first City on the European Side was called Soly-Kamskoi, which is as
much as to say, the great City on the River Kama; and here we
thought to have seen some evident Alteration in the People, their
Manner, their Habit, their Religion, and their Business; but we were
mistaken, for as we had a vast Desert to pass, which by Relation is
near seven hundred Miles long in some Places, but not above two
hundred Miles over where we passed it; so till we came past that
horrible Place, we found very little Difference between that Country
and the Mongol Tartary; the People mostly Pagans, and little better
than the Savages of America, their Houses and Towns full of Idols,
and their Way of Living wholly barbarous, except in the Cities as
above, and the Villages near them; where there are Christians, as they
call themselves, of the Greek Church, but have their Religion mingled
with so many Relics of Superstition, that it is scarce to be known
in some Places from mere Sorcery and Witchcraft
In passing this Forest, I thought indeed we must, after all oui
Dangers were in our Imagination escap'd, as before, have been
plunder'd and robbed, and perhaps murder'd by a Troop of Thieves;
of what Country they were, whether the roving Bands of the Ostiachi,
a Kind of Tartars or wild People on the Bank of the Oby, had ranged
thus far, or whether they were the Sable-Hunters of Siberia, I am yet
at a Loss to know; but they were all on Horseback, carry'd Bows
and Arrows, and were at first about five and forty in Number; they
came so near to us, as within about two Musket Shot, and asking no
Questions, they surrounded us with their Horse, and looked very
earnestly upon us twice; at length they placed themselves just in
our Way, upon which we drew up in a little Line before our Camels,
being not above sixteen Men in all; and being drawn up thus, we
halted and sent out the Siberian Servant, who attended his Lord, to
see who they were; his Master was the more willing to let him go,
because he was not a little apprehensive that they were a Siberian
Troop sent out after him: The Man came up near them with a Flag
of Truce, and called them, but though he spoke several of their
Languages, or Dialects of Languages rather, he could not understand
a Word they said; however, after some Signs to him not to come
nearer to them at his Peril; so he said he understood them to mean,
offering to shoot at him if he advanc'd; the Fellow came back no
siser than he went, only that by their Dress, he said, he believ'd them
to be some Tartars of Kalmuck, or of Circassian Hordes; and that
there must be more of them upon the great Desert, though he never
heard that any of them ever were seen so far North before.
This was small Comfort to us; however, we had no Remedy;
there was on our left Hand at about a Quarter of a Mile's Distance,
a little Grove or Clump of Trees which stood close together, and very
near the Road; I immediately resolv'd we would advance to those
Trees, and fortify ourselves as well as we could there; for first I con-
sider'd that the Trees would in a great Measure cover us from their
Arrows, and in the next Place, they could not come to charge us in
a Body; it was indeed my old Portuguese Pilot who propos'd it, and
who had this Excellency attending him, namely, that he was always
readiest and most apt to direct and encourage us in Cases of the most
Danger; we advanc'd immediately with what Speed we could, and
gained that little Wood, the Tartars or Thieves, for we knew not what
to call them, keeping their Stand and not attempting to hinder us;
when we came thither, we found to our great Satisfaction that it was
a swampy springy Piece of Ground, and on the one Side a very great
Spring of Water, which running out in a little Rill or Brook, was a
little farther joined by another of the like Bigness, and was in short
the Head or Source of a considerable River, called afterwards the
Wirtska; the Trees which grew about this Spring were not all
above two hundred, but were very large, and stood pretty thick; so
that as soon as we got in we saw ourselves perfectly safe from the
Enemy, unless they alighted and attack'd us on Foot
But to make this more difficult, our Portuguese, with indefatigable
Application, cut down great Arms of the Trees, and laid them hanging
tut quite cut off from one Tree to another, so that he made a continued
Fence almost round us.
We stayed here waiting the Motion of the Enemy some Hours
without perceiving they made any Motion; when about two Hours
before Night they came down directly upon us, and though we had
not perceiv'd it, we found they had been joined by some more of the
same, so that they were near fourscore Horse, whereof, however, we
fancied some were Women: They came on till they were within half
Shot of our little Wood, when we fired one Musket without Ball, and
called to them in the Russian Tongue, to know what they wanted, and
bid them keep off; but as if they knew nothing of what we said, they
came on with a double Fury directly up to the Wood side, not imagin-
ing we were so barricaded that they could not break in: our old
Pilot was our Captain, as well as he had been our Engineer, and de-
sir'd of us not to fire upon them till they came within Pistol-Shot, and
that we might be sure to kill, and that when we did fire, we should be
sure to take good Aim; we bade him give the Word of Command,
which he delay'd so long, that they were some of them within two
Pikes' Length of us when we fired.
We aimed so true, (or Providence directed our Shot so sure,) that
we killed fourteen of them and wounded several others, as also several
of their Horses; for we had all of us loaded our Pieces with two or
three Bullets at least
They were terribly surpris'd with our Fire, and retreated immediately
about one Hundred Rods from us; in which Time we loaded oui
Pieces again, and seeing them keep that Distance, we sallied out and
catched four or five of their Horses, whose Riders we supposed were
killed, and coming up to the dead, we could easily perceive they were
Tartars, but knew not from what Country, or how they came to make
an Excursion such an unusual Length.
About an Hour after they made a Motion to attack us again, and
rode round our little Wood, to see where else they might break in;
but finding us always ready to Face them, they went off again, and we
resolv'd not to stir from the Place for that Night
We slept little, you may be sure, but spent the most Part of the
Nighf in strengthening our Situation, and barricading the Entrances
into the Wood, and keeping a strict Watch. We waited for Day-
light, and when it came it gave us a very unwelcome Discovery in-
deed; for the Enemy, whom we thought were discourag'd with the
Reception they had met with, were now increas'd to no less than
three hundred, and had set up eleven or twelve Huts and Tents, as
if they were resolv'd to besiege us; and this little Camp they had
pitched upon the open Plain, at about three Quarters of a Mile from
us. We were indeed surpris'd at this Discovery; and now I confess
I gave myself over for lost, and all that I had: The Loss of my
Effects did not lie so near me, (though they were very considerable^) as
the Thoughts of falling into the Hands of such Barbarians, at the
latter End of my Journey, after so many Difficulties and Hazards as I
had gone through, and even in Sight of our Port, where we expected
Safety and Deliverance; as for my Partner, he was raging; he de-
clar'd that to lose his Goods would be his Ruin, and he would rather
die than be starved; and he was for fighting to the last Drop.
The young Lord, as gallant as ever Flesh showed itself, was for
fighting to the last also; and my old Pilot was of the Opinion we were
able to resist them all in the Situation we were then in; and thus we
spent the Day in Debates of what we should do, but towards Even-
ing we found that the Number of our Enemies still increas'd; perhaps
is they were abroad in several Parties for Prey, the first had sent
out Scouts to call for Help, and to acquaint them of the Booty, and
we did not know but by the Morning they might still be a greater
Number; so I began to inquire of those People we had brought
from Tobolski if there was no other or more private Ways by which
we might avoid them in the Night, and perhaps either retreat to some
Town, or get Help to guard us over the Desert
The Siberian who was Servant to the young Lord, told u* if we
design'd to avoid them and not fight, he would engage to carry us ofl
in the Night, to a Way that went North towards the Petrou, by which
he made no Question but we might get away, and the Tartars never
the wiser; but he said his Lord had told him he would not retreat,
but would rather choose to fight I told him he mistook his Lord,
for that he was too wise a Man to love Fighting for the sake of it;
that I knew his Lord was brave enough by what he had showed
already; but that his Lord knew better than to desire to have seven-
teen or eighteen Men fight five hundred, unless an unavoidable Neces-
sity forced them to it; and that if he thought it possible for us to
escape in the Night, we had nothing else to do but to attempt it He
answer'd, if his Lord gave him such Orders he would lose his Life if
he did not perform it; we soon brought his Lord to give that Order,
though privately, and we immediately prepar'd for the putting it i"
Practice.
And first, as soon as it began to be dark, we kindled a Fire in ou»
little Camp, which we kept burning and prepar'd so as to make it
burn all Night, that the Tartars might conclude we were still there;
but as soon as it was dark, (that is to say) so as we could see the Stars
(for our Guide would not stir before) having all our Horses and
Camels ready loaden, we followed our new Guide, who I soon found
steered himself by the Pole, or North Star, all the Country being
level for a long Way.
After we had travell'd two Hours very hard, it began to be lighter
still, not that it was quite dark all Night, but the Moon began to rise,
so that in short it was rather lighter than we wished it to be; but by
six o'clock the next Morning we were gotten near forty Miles,
though the Truth is we almost spoiled our Horses. Here we found
a Russian Village named Kcrmazinskoy, where we rested, and heard
nothing of the Calmuck Tartars that Day; about two Hours before
Night we set out again, and travell'd till eight the next Morning,
though not quite so quick as before, and about seven o'clock we
passed a little River called Kirtza, and came to a good large Town
inhabited by Russians, and very populous, called Ozomoys; there
we heard that several Troops or Hordes of Calmucks had been Abroad
upon the Desert, but that we were now completely out of Danger of
them, which was to our great Satisfaction, you may be sure. Here we
t^ere oblig'd to get some fresh Horses, and having need enough of
Aest, we stayed five Days; and my Partner and I agreed to give the
honest Siberian who brought us thither the Value of ten Pistoles foi
his conducting us.
In five Days more we came to Veuslima, upon the River JVilzogda,
and, running into the Dwina, wr w-y». there very happily near the
end of our Travels by Land, that Kiver being navigable in seven
Days' Passage to Archangel; from hence we came to Lawrenskoy
the 3rd of July, and providing ourselves with two Luggage Boats, and
a Barge for our own Convenience, we embark'd the 7 th, and arriv'd
all safe at Archangel the i8th, having been a Year and five Months
and three Days on the Journey, including our Stay of eight Months
and odd Days at Tobolski.
We were oblig'd to stay at this Place six Weeks for the Arrival of
the Ships, and must have tarried longer, had not a Hamburgher come
in above a Month sooner than any of the English Ships; when after
some Consideration, that the City of Hamburgh might happen to be
as good a Market for our Goods as London, we all took Freight with
him, and having put my Goods on board, it was most natural for me
to put my Steward on board to take care of them, by which means
my young Lord had a sufficient Opportunity to conceal himself, never
coming on Shore in all the time we stayed there; and this he did
that he might not be seen in the City, where some of the Moscow
Merchants would certainly have seen and discover'd him.
We sailed from Archangel the 20th of August the same Year, and
after no extraordinary bad Voyage, arriv'd in the Elbe the 13 th of
September. Here my Partner and I found a very good Sale for our
Goods, as well those of China as the Sables, &•*. of Siberia; and
dividing the Produce of our Effects, u'y Share amounted to
3475/. 17X. 3d. notwithstanding so many Losses we had sustain'd and
Charges we had been at; only remembering that I had included in
this about six hundred Pounds worth of Diamonds which I had pur-
chas'd at Bengal.
Here the young Lord took his leave of us, and went up the Elbe
in order to go to the Court of Vienna, where he resolv'd to seek Pro-
tection, and where he could correspond with those of his Father's
Friends who were left alive: He did not part without all the Testi-
monies he could give me of Gratitude for the Service I had done
him, and his Sense ot my Kindness to the Prince his Father.
To conclude, having stayed near four Months in Hamburgh,! came
from thence Qver Land to the Hague, where I embark'd ;n the
5»7
Packet, and arriv'd in London the ioth of January, 1^5, naving
been gone from England ten Years and nine Months.
And here, resolving to harass myself no more, I am preparing for *
longer Journey than all these, having lived 72 Years a Life of infinite
Variety, and learned sufficiently to know the Value of Retirement
nd the Blessing of ending our Days in Peace

TO THE ORIGINAL EDITION, 1719.
TTF ever the Story of any private Man's Adventures in the Worla
-were worth making Public, and were acceptable when Publish'a\
the Editor of this Account thinks this will be so.
The Wonders of this Man's Life exceed all that (he thinks) is to bt
found extant; the Life of one Man bang scarce capable of a greater
Variety
The Story is told with Modesty, with Seriousness, and with a religious
Application of Events to the Uses to which wise Men always apply
them (viz.) to the Instruction of others by this Example, and to justify
and honour the Wisdom of Providence in all the Variety of out
Circumstances, let them happen how they will.
The Editor believes the thing to be a just History of Fact; neither is
there any Appearance of Fiction in it: And however thinks, because all
such things are dispatch'd, that the Improvement of it, as well to the
Diversion, as to the Instruction of the Reader, will be the same; and as
such, he thinks, without farther Compliment to the World, he does them
a great Service in the Publication
it: tIt; First Edition of "Robinson Crtisoe."]
"T^HE Publisher desires just one word with the reenters of this edition of " Robinson
Crusoe." After making a careful examination of every accessible reprint of
importance from 1719 down to the present time, great was his surprise to find that
not one of the hundreds of so-called "revised editions" had given the correct text of the
Author, but had—to all appearance—copied from each other, adding a few variations
here and there to give an air of originality. Occasionally these variations consist of
such trivialities as the change of one word for another, but the substitution of even
homely for polite expressions assists in spoiling a narrative charming for its perfect
simplicity; thus " home" has been changed to "residence;" "household goods"
to "furniture," &c. Even the text of a late edition in the Globe Library must be
received with some suspicion when the Editor tells us that he '' printed from the edition
of 1719 but collated i! with earlier editions !" which is all nonsense, because there are
no editions earlier than 1719. By the kindness of Mr. Lee, a copy of the very valuable
and rare first edition in two vols., 1719, has been deposited with the printers during
the progress of the work through the press, and there, in a glass case, every word and
letter have been examined in preparing the present edition, which is believed to represent
the only perfect text of Defoe's narrative since the time of its Author.
TO THE PRESENT EDITION.
To Girls and Boys,—Toung and Old,—Everywhere.
ON this twenty-fifth day of April, in the year one thousand eight
hundred and sixty nine, which is exactly a century and a half
since his first appearance in the world, it does seem like an act of
presumptuous supererogation to say,—"Allow me to introduce to
you Mr. Robinson Crusoe, and his Strange Surprizing Adventures!"
Indeed I can almost hear a reply, in a million voices,—of many lan-
guages,—from all points of the compass,—"Why, we have known
him ever since we can remember I"
That may be; yet, without presumption, I think I shall be able to
tell some, at least, of my readers more than they already know.
This then must be my apology. Those who know "all about it,"
and need no " Introduction," may turn over a few leaves, and take
their old acquaintance by the hand, without further ceremony.
The historic original of Robinson Crusoe was Alexander Selcraig,
the seventh son of John Selcraig and Euphan Mackie. He was born
at Largo in the county of Fife, in Scotland, a.d. 1676; and went to
sea in 1695, changing his name to Selkirk. He was not again heard
of until 1701, when he returned to his native place. On the 18th
May 1703, he sailed from the Downs in the Cinque Ports galley,
96 tons, 18 guns, and 63 men, Charles Pickering, captain; Thomas
Stradling, lieutenant; and himself, Selkirk, sailing-master. On the
24th November, the same year, they anchored at La Granda, Brazil,
where Capt Pickering died, and the command devolved upon
Stradling. They left on the 8th December, and on the 10th February,
the following year, cast anchor at the Island of Juan Fernandez.
After taking in wood and water they sailed on the 29th February in
pursuit of a French ship, but returned in the month of September.
In consequence of frequent quarrels between himself and Stradling,
and a fear that the ship was not sea-worthy, Selkirk determined to
leave the vessel; and when she departed at the end of the month
all his effects, with additional necessaries, were taken on shore, and
he remained alone on the island.
On the 2nd February 1709, the privateer ships Duke and Duchess,
commanded by Captain Woodes Rogers, anchored at Juan Fer-
nandez, and found Selkirk there. He engaged in the capacity of
Mate on board the Duke, and they sailed on the iath of the same
month, arriving at Erith, on the Thames, the 14th October 1711.
In the following year, Capt Woodes Rogers published an account
of his voyages, in which he relates the finding of Selkirk, and how he
had lived alone on the island "four years and four months."
Another officer of the same expedition, Capt Edward Cooke, pub-
lished a similar volume during the same year, and states on the title-
page :—" Wherein an Account is given of Mr. Alexander Selkirk, his
"Manner of living and taming some wild Beasts during the four Years
"and four Months he hVd upon the uninhabited Island of Juan
"Fernandez? Sir Richard Steele appears to have had an interview
with Selkirk soon after the arrival of the latter in England, and made
his adventures the subject of No. 26 of The Englishman, published
in December, 1713.
These are all the historical resources known to have been available
for the production of " Robinson Crusoe."
I may, however, add a few particulars as to the subsequent career
of Selkirk. His share of prize money, while on board the ship Duke,
amounted to .£800; which, having received, he set out for his native
place, and arrived there early in 1712. After investing his money he
appears to have remained in Largo until 1717, when he again went
to sea, leaving his property in charge of his relations. He never re-
turned, though he was heard of at times from Bristol, Liverpool, and
London; but he became a Lieutenant in the Royal Navy, and died
in that capacity on board his Maj esty's ship Weymouth, in the year 1723.
The first attempt to collect all the facts that could be ascertained
about Selkirk, was by Isaac James, of Bristol, who, in 1800, published
a small volume, entitled, " Providence Displayed: or, The Remark-
"able Adventures of Alexander Selkirk," &c. &c. A few additional
particulars are contained in "The Life of Alexander Selkirk," by
John Howell, London, 1829. The most recent work, I believe, on
the subject, is entitled " Crusoniana; or, Truth versus Fiction, eluci-
u dated in a History of the Islands of Juan Fernandez, by a Retired
"Governor of that Colony. Manchester. Published by the author.
"1843." The author was Lieut-Col. Thomas Sutcliffe, and his
iccount of Selkirk forms the second chapter of his work, pp. 14-52.
I have yet to state one interesting fact, on the authority of the
Panama Star and Herald of 6th October, 1868; namely, that a
monument had been executed by Messrs. J. Child & Son, Valparaiso,
for erection on the island of Juan Fernandez. Its inscription wi'1
tell its own tale:—
In Memory of
ALEXANDER SELKIRK,
MARINEP,
^ native of Largo, in the County of Fife, Scotland,
Who lived on this Island, in complete Solitude,
For four years and four months.
€ was landed from the Cinque Ports galley, 06 tons,
18 guns, a.d. 1704, and was taken off in the
Duke, privateer, 13th February, 1709.
He died Lieutenant of H.M.S. Weymouth,
AJ). 1723, aged 47 years.
This Tablet is erected near Selkirk's look-out,
By Commodore Powell and the Officers
of H.M.S. Topaze, a.d. 1868.
The above, erected in a desolate island on the opposite side of tht
globe, after the lapse of a hundred and fifty years, is evidence of the
force of intellectual genius exerted by the writer who first made
Selkirk famous. This brings us back to the author of "Robinson
Crusoe," whose imperishable work will still exist, in all its freshness,
when the most endurable monument of marble shall have been re-
solved into its original dust
The great reputation of " Robinson Crusoe" has attached a degree
of interest to every fact connected with its history. As to the
authorship of the work. Nearly fifty years after its first publication
a rumour was alluded to, in the Biographia Britannica, that Dr.
Arbuthnot was the writer; but no reason was given, and the account
concludes with stating:—"it was the delectable Offspring of the
"teeming Brain of Daniel Defoe, a Writer famous in his Generation
"for Politics and Poetry."
A more circumstantial tissue of hearsay appeared about eight years
later, when Mr. T. Warton gravely stated that the Rev. Benjamin
Holloway, of Middleton Stony, told him, that Lord Sunderland
issured him, that the first volume of " Robinson Crusoe" was written
by the Earl of Oxford, while a Prisoner in the Tower, "as an amuse-
ment under confinement,"—and was given to Defoe, who visited
him there; and, that Defoe printed it as his own, with his Lordship's
approbation, adding the second volume, "the inferiority of which is
generally acknowledged." Now, ist, Lord Oxford was so pros-
trated by illness, during the greater part of his imprisonment, that it
was matter of speculation whether or not he would live to be tried.
He was incapable of preparing his defence, and on that account the
House of Lords, from time to time, granted his petitions for post-
ponement of his trial. He was therefore in no capacity to write a
romance "as an amusement under confinement" 2nd,—He was
discharged from his impeachment, by the House of Lords, two years
before " Robinson Crusoe" was heard of. 3rd,—Only the Earl of
Oxford and Defoe could have originally known if there had been any
foundation of truth in the matter, and there is not a tittle of evidence
that either ever uttered a word thereon. 4th,—Lord Sunderland
would have been one of the last to whom they would have communi-
cated the secret, because :—5th,—During the whole of the impeach-
ment against Lord Oxford, Lord Sunderland spoke and voted against
him. There could be no intercourse between the prisoner, and the
man who believed him a traitor, and sought to bring his head to the
block. 6th,—Defoe was in the service of the government, and under
Lord Sunderland's power, during Lord Oxford's imprisonment, and
he so continued when "Robinson Crusoe" was published. Self in-
terest would make him reticent 7 th,—The smallest share of critical
acumen is sufficient to decide not only that the second volume of
"Robinson Crusoe" is not inferior to the first, but that the two
volumes are equally the offspring of the same parent
It seems the singular fate of human greatness to be misunderstood,
disparaged, and comparatively forgotten by the generations imme-
diately succeeding. Shakespeare, Milton, Queen Anne, the Duke of
Marlborough, Daniel Defoe, and many others might be mentioned as
instances of this neglect of posterity. Great men ultimately, however,
become incorporated with the history of their country; and some
ater literary research brings to light much that had been obscured,
and enables after ages to form more accurate judgment of their
characters and genius. Defoe is now much better known than
he was a hundred years ago. Going back to the pamphlets ana
newspapers of the period, it becomes obvious that no doubt whatever
existed, at the time, as to the authorship of " Robinson Crusoe." In
fhe year of its first appearance, and even before the second volume
<fas published, a mutilated abridgment of the first was clandestinely
printed for T. Cox, of the Amsterdam Coffee-House, in London.
When remonstrated with and threatened, he only replied by an
Advertisement in "The Flying Post," in which he abused and in-
sulted Defoe; proving, that although the work was published anony-
mously, there was, even then, no doubt as to the authorship. In the
preface to the first edition of the second volume Defoe alludes to
this transaction. In the same year also, Charles Gildon published a
satirical pamphlet, entitled, "The Life and Strange Surprizing Ad-
"ventures of Mr. D De F , of London, Hosier, who has
"lived above fifty Years by himself, in the Kingdoms of North and
"South Britain. The various Shapes he has appear'd in, and the
"Discoveries he has made for the Benefit of his Country. In a
"Dialogue between Him, Robinson Crusoe, and his Man Friday.
"With Remarks Serious and Comical upon the Life of Crusoe." In
"An Epistle to D D' F—e, the reputed Author of Robinson
Crusoe." The writer confesses that "Crusoe" was already "fam'd
"from Tuttle Street to Limehouse-hole. There is not an old
"Woman," says he, " that can go to the price of it, but buys thy
"' Life and Adventures,' and leaves it as a Legacy, with the
"' Pilgrim's Progress,' the ' Practice of Piety,' and 'God's Revenge
"against Murther,' to her Posterity."
Defoe does not seem to have replied to the above; but when, a
few years later, Bishop Benjamin Hoadley inserted some strictures in
the London Journal about " Robinson Crusoe" filling his pockets with
biscuit, after having previously divested himself of his clothes, Defoe
replied very warmly in Applebeis Journal. In like manner he was
highly incensed at one of the pirates, who then infested the coasts of
Carolina and Virginia, for having named his ship Robinson Crusoe,
and calls him "a most bloody-minded murdering Rogue." A col-
lateral and inferential bearing on the fact of Defoe's authorship may
be found in the chagrin of the booksellers against Mr. William
Taylor, for his having secured to himself the great profits arising from
.he publication of "Robinson Crusoe;" and, that seven or more of
them shortly afterward, entered into a confederacy for the joint pub-
iication of such works of fiction as Defoe might write.
Another unfounded rumour of the generation after Defoe's decease
was, that Selkirk had written some Memoir or Journal, which he
placed in Defoe's hands in order that he might digest it for publica-
tion, but that the latter used the documents for his own purpose to
the damage of their author,—and then returned the papers to Selkirk,
telling him his history would not sell. The answer is simple and
complete. I have stated that Selkirk returned to England in 17 n,—
that the volume of Capt Woodes Rogers, and that of Capt Edward
Cooke were both published in 1712; followed by Sir Richard Steele's
paper in 1713. These three accounts contained what Selkirk had to
say of himself, and being printed, they became public property. Yet
they remained otherwise entirely unappropriated until Defoe's work
appeared in 1719; and, in "Robinson Crusoe," nothing has been
discovered to be historic fact except what he gathered from those pre-
viously published works. I have mentioned the titles of subsequent
accounts of Selkirk, containing many additional particulars of his
adventures, but none of these are to be found in "Robinson Crusoe."
Mr. James and others, to whom we are indebted for investigating the
history of Selkirk, tell us that "John Selkirk, a weavei ^t Largo, in
"1794, was in possession of the Gun and Chest which his great-uncle
"brought from Juan Fernandez; and they also had a drinking Cup
"of Cocoa-nut shell, tipped with silver, which had been his property."
These treasures are known to be still in existence; but of those who
had carefully preserved such relics, Mr. James states (in 1800) "Even
"Selkirk's relations do not know that he left any Journals behind
"him." The conclusion is evident:—That Defoe fairly acquired,
from published accounts, some of the fundamental incidents of
"Robinson Crusoe's" Life; but the ever-varying events that fill up
the historic monotony,—the useful and improving moralities,—and
the fascinating style,—are all his own.
It may add to the interest of " Robinson Crusoe," with young readers,
to know something of the circumstances under which it was written.
There is every reason to believe that Defoe was then quite easy as to
his pecuniary circumstances; yet there is perhaps no parallel in the
world's history to his marvellous literary industry. The following is
an epitome of his known labours, from the appearance of the first
volume of " Robinson Crusoe," on the 25th of April, 1719 (pp. 366),
to the publication, on the 6th of August 1720, of the third volume
(now never reprinted,) entitled " Serious Reflections during the Life
and Surprizing Adventures of Robinson Crusoe. With his Vision of
the Angelick World," &c.
Besides holding a very responsible though objectionable office of
"Censor of Public Journals," under the government of George I., he
edited, at the same time, a monthly publication called Mercurius
Politicus, each number containing not less than 64 pages; a Weekly
fournal;—occasionally The Whitehall Evening Post, published thrice
weekly;—and part of the time a paper called The Daily Post. In
addition to these, the first volume of Crusoe was immediately fol-
lowed by Some Account of the Life, Sic., of Henry Baron Goertz,
(pp. 46.) A Letter to the Dissenters, (pp. 27.) The Anatomy of Ex-
change Alley, (pp. 64.) Then appeared the second volume of Robinson
Crusoe, published on the 20th of August 1719, (pp. 380.) This was
succeeded by Dickory Cronke, (pp. 64.) Charity still a Christian
Virtue, (pp. 72.) The King of Pirates, Captain Avery, (pp. 100.)
The Chimera, (pp. 76.) The Life and Adventures of Mr Duncan
Campbell, (pp. 344.) Campbell's Pacquet, an Apparition, (pp. 14.)
Alemoirs of a Cavalier, (pp. 350.^ The Life, Adventures, and Piracies
of Captain Singleton, (pp. (344.) After which appeared the third
volume of Robitison Crusoe, published on the 6th August 1720,
(PP- 370.)
The aggregate of Defoe's literary labours, during about a year and
a half, including " Robinson Crusoe," exceeds four thousand octavo
printed pages.
I must mention another fact connected with the history of " Robin-
son Crusoe," and its great popularity. Even so minute a circumstance
as the place where it was written has not escaped controversy, and
the claims of different localities have been numerous. Most of these
claims rest upon an erroneous supposition that Defoe was, at that
time, under the frowns of Government, and obliged to conceal him-
self. A house in Halifax, Yorkshire, is pointed out in the history of
that town. Gateshead, in the county of Durham, has claimed the
honour. A house in Harrow-alley, Whitechapel Market, has been
said to be the birthplace of both "Robinson Crusoe" and the Journalof
the Plague, although three years intervened between their publication.
A correspondent assured one of Defoe's biographers that "Robinson
f-

DEFOES HOUSE AT STOKE NEWINGTON.
Crusoe" was written in the back chamber over the washhouse of a
cottage in the little village of Hartley, in Kent It might be deemed
conclusive that Gihlon, writing at the time, lays the scene of the scur-
rilous dialogue already alluded to, in a field at Stoke Newington,
where Defoe would be close to his home. We now know, from more
recent researches, that he was in London, where his duties under
the Government imperatively required his presence,—that he was
under no necessity of concealment:—and, that " Robinson Crusoe"
could only have been written in his own house at Stoke Newington.
But I must now acquaint such readers of " Robinson Crusoe" as
are not already aware of the fact, that besides having Alexander
Selkirk as an "historical Original," there is enclosed, in an occult
manner, throughout its pages, an "Emblematic Original," namely,
that Crusoe contains the principal events of Defoe's own Life.
The first and second volumes contain all the narrative and romantic
part of " Robinson Crusoe;" but I have stated that there is a third
volume, now never reprinted, and little known, entitled Serious Re-
flections, &c. It is filled with metaphysical disquisitions on morals
and religion, divided into chapters and sections:—On Solitude,—On
Honesty,—On Immorality of Conversation,—On the present State of Re-
ligion in the World,—On Divine Providence,—On the proportion be-
tween the numbers of Christians and Pagans,—and a Vision of the
Angelic World. From this brief enumeration of principal topics it
will be obvious that, however interesting these digressive Reflections
may be to the Christian philosopher, this third volume is not adapted
to the same class of readers as the two narrative volumes. It wants
that simple naturalness, the charm of reality,.—which, in them, is
spread over the commonest incidents; and yet,—all concentrating in
one solitary man,—combine to perfect the fascination of the story.
The above may be sufficient to serve two purposes :—first, why
the volume of Serious Reflections has rarely been reprinted with the
narrative, and is also omitted in the present edition ;— and secondly,
why I have thus mentioned it in this Introduction, namely, that the
Preface to the third volume discloses the fact, that the vicissitudes of
Defoe's own Life are parabolically related in the narrative volumes of
the work.
In this Preface he affirms that " the story, though Allegorical, is
"also Historical. Farther, that there is a Man alive, and well known
"too, the Actions of whose Life are the just subject of these Volumes,
"and to whom all or most Part of the Story most directly alludes;
"this may be depended upon for Truth. Without letting the Reader
"into a nearer Explication of the Matter, I proceed to let him know,
"that the happy deductions I have employed myself to make from
u all the Circumstances of my Story, will abundantly make him amends
"for his not having the Emblem explained by the Original. In a
u Word, there's not a Circumstance in the imaginary Story, but has
"its just allusion to a real Story, and Chimes Part for Part, and Step
"for Step, with the inimitable Life of Robinson Crusoe" With re-
spect to the fictitious representation of Crusoe's forced confinement
in an island, he says, " 'tis as reasonable to represent one kind of
"Imprisonment by another, as it is to represent any Thing that really
"exists by that which exists not Had the common way of writing
* a Man's private History been taken, and I had given you the con-
"duct or Life of a Man you knew, and whose Misfortunes and In-
"nrmities perhaps you had sometimes unjustly triumphed over; all
"I could have said would have yielded no Diversion, and perhaps
"scarce have obtained a reading, or at best no attention. The
"Teacher, like a greater, having no Honour in his own country."
From this it is quite clear that Defoe had seriously considered the
propriety, or otherwise, of writing his autobiography; but having in
his surprising adventures, as he goes on to say, "suffered all manner
"of Violences and Oppressions, injurious Reproaches, contempt of
"Men, attacks of Devils, corrections from Heaven, and Oppositions
"on Earth; and had innumerable ups and downs in matters of For-
"tune," he was convinced that the clearing up of his own character
and conduct, in plain words, would be an indictment against the age
in which he had lived. That his contemporaries would either refuse
to read, or would resent it He therefore gave to the world the
eventful story of his own Life, and the lessons contained therein,
under the "Emblem" of Robinson Crusoe, "without letting the
"Reader into a nearer Explication of the matter."
If we could now lay open TAe Life and Strange Surprizing
Adventures of Robinson Crusoe, side by side with Memoirs of the
Life of Daniel Dejoe, and trace throughout the parallels between
what he calls the "Emblem" and the "Original," the results
would be as valuable as interesting; but the attempt would, we
fear, be comparatively in vain. What the author intended to be
only veiled, time has rendered obscure, if not consigned to entire
oblivion.
Having already given the exact dates when the first editions of the
respective volumes of Crusoe were published, I must add a few words (
as to the success of the work. The first volume was so immediately
sold off that a second edition was published on the 12 th May, only
«eventeen days after the first;—a third, on the 6th June ;—a spurious
edition on the 7 th August;—a*.id, on the following day, the fourth
edition appeared. Meanwhile, the author had been busy on the
second volume; and there is reason to believe that its first edition,
on the 20th August, was a very large issue. During the same year
the two volumes were translated into German and French. From
lie 7th October, 1719, to the 19th October, 1720, the first and
second volumes were reprinted in weekly portions, in a newspaper
called the Original London Post, or Hcatheotfs Intelligencer. The
fifth edition was an abridgment, in one volume, on the 19th Nov.
1720 ;—the sixth, in two volumes, 28th October, 1721;—the seventh,
on the 28th February, 1722 ; and the eighth, in two volumes, with 14
copper-plates, (called the 6th Edition,) on the 5th of June, in the
same year. Since then, it has been translated and printed in Italian,
Spanish, Russian, Arabic, and almost every living language that has
become subjected to grammar and the press. Ever Latin and Greek
ire not without their translations of this immortal work. In English,
the editions have been, and continue to be innumerable;—from the
elegantly illustrated, gilt-leaved and morocco-bound, costly edition,
for the aristocratic drawing-room,—down, down, through all sizes,
abridgments, and prices, suited to every grade of society and every
class of readers, to the penny, and even farthing books, vended oniy
from the basket of the itinerant village hawker.
It has been truly said that Defoe took no more of "Robinson
Crusoe" from the accounts of Selkirk than Shakespeare did of Mac-
beth and Hamlet from the old Scotch and Danish Chronicles; yet
we have seen that all the materials, available to Defoe, had been pub-
lished, and were therefore at the service of any other writer, from
six to seven years, though none had made use of them, before the
genius of our author gave to the world his celebrated romance. No
sooner however had the work appeared than its popularity called
forth many imitations, some of them short-lived, but several still
known and read.
Mr. Wilson is mistaken in saying that the first rival of Crusoe was
"Philip Quarll." The following work was published on the 3rd
October, 1719, and it will be at once seen that the name "Vend-
church" is a travestied synonym of Selkirk: "The Adventures and
"Surprizing Deliverances of James Dubourdieu and his Wife, from
"the uninhabited Part of the Island of Paradise, &c. Also the
"Adventures of Alexander Vendchurch, set on Shore on an Island
"in the South Sea," &c. The next was, "The Life and Strange
Surprizing Adventures of Major Alexander Ramkins," &c., pub-
lished the 3rd Dec. 1719. Two days afterwards appeared, "The
"Voyages, Travels, and dangerous Adventures of Captain Richard
"Falconer," &c. Defoe himself further contributed to the love of
maritime adventure by writing,—" The King of Pirates. Being an
"Account of the Famous Enterprizes of Captain Avery, the Mock
"King of Madagascar," &c., published on the 10th Dec. 1719. And
again, on the 4th of June, in the following year, appeared his "Life,
Adventures and Piracies of the Famous Captain Singleton," &c
.
Many of the imitations of Crusoe are now almost forgotten; but 1
may mention "The Voyages and Adventures of Miles Phillips, a
West Country Sailor, &c . Written by Himself," &c published the a6th
Feb. 1724. The colonics of North America must also have their
Crusoe, and in Dec. 1725, a book was published at Boston, New
England, entitled, "The Strange Adventures and Signal Deliverances
"of Mr. Philip Ashton, Jun., Sec. who lived alone upon a Desolate
"Island in the Gulph of Honduras for about Sixteen Months." 1
may also notice, in order of date, while passing, that on the 20th of
January, 1726, was published "A Voyage Round the World by Way
of the Great South Sea, &c. By Captain George Shelvocke."
From this book it aopears that Shelvocke's ship was cast away, the
2£th of May, 1720, on the island of Juan Fernandez, and that he and
his crew remained there until the 6th of October in the same year.
He fully describes the island, but mentions no relics of Selkirk, or of
any previous human inhabitant; and he appears to have been, by
long absence from England, ignorant of the existence of "Robinson
Crusoe." On the 10th of March, 1726, appeared, "The Voyages
and Adventures of Captain Robert Boyle," &c. And in October
of the same year, Dean Swift's celebrated "Travels into several
Remote Nations of the World, by Lemuel Gulliver," &c. The
longest-lived, among the strict imitations of Crusoe, was published on
the 15th of April, 1737, and is entitled "The Hermit: or, the Un-
"paralleled Sufferings and Surprizing Adventures of Mr. Philip
"Quarll, an Englishman. Who was discovered by Mr. Dorrington, a
"Bristol Merchant, upon an uninhabited Island in the South Sea;
"where he has lived above Fifty Years, without any human Assist-
"ance, still continues to reside, and will not come away," &c. This,
though very inferior to Crusoe, is still reprinted in abridged form,
and in numerous editions. I might go on to mention, "A Voyage
to Cacklogallinia, by Captain S. Brunt," published the 15th of July,
1727. And "The Pleasant and Surprizing Adventures of Mr.
"Robert Drury, during his Fifteen Years' Captivity on the Island of
"Madagascar," &c. which first appeared on the 24th of May, 1729;
and, in which, the hero is almost as perfectly isolated inland, among
the barbarous natives, as Crusoe was on his desolate island. I
might enumerate others that appeared between 1730 and 1750, when
"The Life and Adventures of Peter Wilkins, a Cornish Man. Taken
"from his own Mouth in his Passage to England from off Cape
"Horn in America, ir. the Ship Hector," was published. These
however will suffice to show how large a fleet of smaller craft followed
in the wake of that which, in 1719, began its course along the stream
of time, having on board "Robinson Crusoe, of York, Mariner."
Thus, to recapitulate, I have given a brief account of the "His-
torical original" of this celebrated work,—of its authorship,—the cir-
cumstances under which it was composed,—the place where it was
written,—its " Emblematic Original," as enclosing an autobiography
of Defoe, the author,—how it was received by the world, its imme-
diate and lasting popularity,—the numerous rivals and imitations that
followed it
Shall I still keep my readers from the rich intellectual repast before
them, by lengthening out this "grace before meat" with any feeble
observations and encomiums of my own? As to the naturalness,—
the truth and simplicity,—the fine sentiments, the delicate wit,—the
pure morality,—the instructive vindication of the ways of Provi-
dence,—to be found everywhere in the following pages; all of which,
and other unmentioned beauties, make it greatly superior to any
other work of its kind? I am convinced that I should not deserve
thanks for so doing ; nor even if I were to greatly extend this Intro-
duction by quoting the criticism and eloquent things said of it by a
host of writers and men of genius; among whom are the names of
Dr. Blair, Dr. Johnson, M. Rousseau, M. Marmontel, Chalmers, Dr.
Beattie, Dr. Towers, Sir Walter Scott, Charles Lamb, Judge Tai-
fourd, S. T. Coleridge, Wilson, Hazlitt, and Archbishop Whately.
The day has long since gone by when "Robinson Crusoe" required
any testimonial as to character.
I have aimed only at adding something to what is popularly known
respecting the history of the book, and hope I have to some extent
succeeded.
Probably few of the present generation, especially of the young,
have ever seen -the first and unabridged edition of "Robinson
Crusoe," except perhaps the one locked up, as a rarity, in a glass
show-case in the British Museum. Scarcely any work has been more
mutilated by printers; and there is reason to doubt whether, in
modern times, the original has ever been reprinted verbatim. I am
able to affirm that the present is an exact reproduction from my own
copy of the first edition. The illustrations by an eminent French
artist have been designed expressly for this edition.

THE
LIFE AND ADVENTURES
OF
ROBINSON CRUSOE, v«

WAS born in the Year 1632, in the City of York,
of a good Family, though not of that Country, my
Father being a Foreigner of Bremen, who settled
first at Hull: He got a good Estate by Merchan-
dise, and leaving off his Trade, lived afterwards at
York, from whence he had married my Mother,
whose Relations were named Robinson, a very good Family in that
Country, and from whom I was called Robinson Krcutznaer; but by
the usual Corruption of Words in England, we are now called, nay
we call ourselves, and write our Name Crusoe, and so my Com-
panions always called me.
I had two elder Brothers, one of which was Lieutenant Colonel to
an English Regiment of Foot in Flanders, formerly commanded by
the famous Col. Lockhart, and was killed at the Battle near Dunkirk
against the Spaniards: What became of my second Brother I never
knew any more than my Father or Mother did know what was
become of me.
Being the third Son of the Family, and not bred to any Trade, my
Head began to be filled very early with rambling Thoughts: My Father,
who was very ancient, had given me a competent Share of Learning,
as far as House-Education and a Country Free-School generally goes,
and design'd me for the Law; but I would be satisfied with nothing
but going to Sea, and my Inclination to this led me so strongly against
the Will, nay the Commands of my Father, and against all the En-
treaties and Persuasions of my Mother and other Friends, that there
seemed to be something fatal in that Propension of Nature tending
directly to the Life of Misery which was to befall me.
My Father, a wise and grave Man, gave me serious and excellent
Ccmsel against what he foresaw was my Design. He called me one
M rning into his Chamber, where he was confined by the Gout, and
3xpostulated very warmly with me upon this Subject: He asked me
what Reasons more than a mere wandering Inclination I had for
leaving my Father's House and my native Country, where I might be
well introduced, and had a Prospect of raising my Fortunes by Appli-
cation and Industry, with a Life of Ease and Pleasure. He told me
it was for Men of desperate Fortunes on one Hand, or of aspiring,
superior Fortunes on the other, who went abroad upon Adventures, to
rise by Enterprize, and make themselves famous in Undertakings of a
Nature out of the common Road; that these things were all either too
far above me, or too far below me; that mine was the middle State,
or what might be called the upper Station of Low Life, which he had
found by long Experience was the best State in the World, the most
ruited to human Happiness, not exposed to the Miseries and Hard-
ships, the Labour and Sufferings of the mechanic Part of Mankind,
and not embarrass'd with the Pride, Luxury, Ambition and Envy of
the upper Part of Mankind. He told me, I might judge of the Hap-
piness of this State, by this one thing, viz. That this was the State of
Life which all other People envied, that Kings have frequently la-
mented the miserable Consequences of being bor n to great things, and
wished they had been placed in the Middle of the two Extremes,
Detween the Mean and the Great; that the wise Man gave his Testi-
mony to this as the just Standard of true Felicity, when he prayed to
have neither Poverty or Riches.
He bid me observe it, and I should always find, that the Calami-
ties of Life were shared among the upper and lower Part of Mankind;
but that the middle Station had the fewest Disasters, and was not
expos'd to so many Vicissitudes as the higher or low«r Part of Man-
kind; nay, they were not subjected to so many Distempers and
Uneasinesses either of Bedy or Mind, as those were who, by vicious
Living, Luxury and Extravagances on one Hand, or by hard Labour,
Want of Necessaries, and mean or insufficient Diet on the other
Hand, bring Distempers upon themselves by the natural Conse-
quences of their Way of Living; That the middle Station of Life was
calculated for all kinds of Virtues and all kinds of Enjoyments; that
Peace and Plenty were the Handmaids of a middle Fortune; that
Temperance, Moderation, Quietness, Health, Society, all agreeable
Diversions, and all desirable Pleasures, were the Blessings attending
the middle Station of Life; that this Way Men went silently and
smoothly through the World, and comfortably out of it, not embarrass'd
with the Labours of the Hands or of the Head, not sold to the Life
of Slavery for daily Bread, or harass'd with perplex'd Circumstances,
which rob the Soul of Peace, and the Body of Rest; not enrag'd with
the Passion of Envy, or secret burning Lust of Ambition for great
things; but in easy Circumstances sliding gently through the World, and
sensibly tasting the Sweets of living, without the bitter, feeling that
they are happy, and learning by every Day's Experience to know il
more sensibly.
After this, he pressed me earnestly, and in the most affectionate
manner, not to play the young Man, not to precipitate myself into
Miseries which Nature and the Station of Life I was born in, seemed
to have provided against; that I was under no Necessity of seeking
my Bread; that he would do well for me, and endeavour to enter me
fairly into the Station of Life which he had been just recommending
to me; and that if I was not very easy and happy in the World, it
must be my mere Fate or Fault that must hinder it, and that he
should have nothing to answer for, having thus discharg'd his Duty in
warning me against Measures which he knew would be to my Hurt:
In a word, that as he would do very kind things for me if I would
stay and settle at Home as he directed, so he would not have so
much Hand in my Misfortunes, as to give me any Encouragement to
go away: And to close all, he told me I had my elder Brother for an
Example, to whom he had used the same earnest Persuasions to keep
him from gcing into the Low Country Wars, but could not prevaif,
his young Desires prompting him to run into the Army, where he
was killed; and though he said he would not cease to pray for me, yet
he would venture to say to me, that if I did take this foolish Step,
God would not bless me, and I would have Leisure hereafter to re
fleet upon having neglected his Counsel when there might be none to
assist in my Recovery.
I observed in this last Part of his Discourse, which was truly
Prophetic, though I suppose my Father did not know it to be so
himself; I say, I observed the Tears run down his Face very
plentifully, and especially when he spoke of my Brother who
was killed; and that when he spoke of my having Leisure to repent,
and none to assist me, he was so moved, that he broke off the Dis-
course, and told me, his Heart was so full he could say no more to me.
I was sincerely affected with this Discourse, as indeed who could
be otherwise; and I resolv'd not to think of going abroad any more,
but to settle at home according to my Father's Desire. But alas! a
few Days wore it all off; and in short, to prevent any of my Father's
farther Importunities, in a few Weeks after, I resolv'd to run quite
away from him. However, I did not act so hastily neither as my
first Heat of ResokVion prompted, but I took my Mother, at a time
when I thought her a little pleasanter than ordinary, and told her,
that my Thoughts v ere so entirely bent upon seeing the World, that
I should never settle to anything with Resolution enough to go
through with it, and my Father had better give me his Consent than
force me to go without it; that I was now Eighteen Years old, which
was too late to go Apprentice to a Trade, or Clerk to an Attorney;
that I was sure if I did, I should never serve out my time, and I
should certainly run away from my Master before my Time was out,
and go to Sea; and if she would speak to my Father to let me go
but one Voyage abroad, if I came home again and did not like it,
I would go no more, and I would promise by a double Dili-
gence to recover that Time I had lost
This put my Mother into a great Passion: She told me, she knew
it would be to no Purpose to speak to my Father upon any such
Subject; that he knew too well what was my Interest to give his
Consent to anything so much for my Hurt, and that she wondered
how I could think of any such thing after such a Discourse as I had
had with my Father, and such kind and tender Expressions as she
knew my Father had used to me; and that, in short, if I would ruin
myself there was no Help for me; but I might depend I should
never have their Consent to it: That for her Part she would not have
so much Hand in my Destruction; and I should never have it to say,
that my Mother was willing when my Father was not
Though my Mother refused to move it to my Father, yet, as I have
heard afterwards, she reported all the Discourse to him, and that my
Father, after showing a great Concern at it, said to her with a Sigh,
That Boy might be happy if he would stay at home, but if he goec
abroad he will be the miserablest Wretch that was ever born: I can
give no Consent to it
It was not till almost a Year after this that I broke loose, though in
the mean time I continued obstinately deaf to all Proposals of
settling to Business, and frequently expostulating with my Father and
Mother, about their being so positively determin'd against what they

knew my Inclinations prompted me to. But being one Day at Hull,
where I went casually, and without any Purpose of making an Elope-
ment that time; but I say, being there, and one of my Companions
being going by Sea to London, in his Father's Ship, and prompting
me to go with them, with the common Allurement of Seafaring Men,
viz. That it should cost me nothing for my Passage, I consulted
neither Father or Mother any more, nor so much as sent them Word
of it; but leaving them to hear of it as they might, without asking
God's Blessing, or my Father's, without any Consideration of Circum-
stances or Consequences, and in an ill Hour, God knows. On the
first of September 16 5 i, I went on Board a Ship bound for London:
never any young Adventurer's Misfortunes, I believe, began sooner,
or continued longer than mine. The Ship was no sooner gotten out
of the Humber, but the Wind began to blow, and the Waves to rise
in a most frightful manner; and as I had never been at Sea before, I
was most inexpressibly sick in Body, and terrified in my Mind: I
began now seriously to reflect upon what I had done, and how justly
I was overtaken by the Judgment of Heaven for my wicked leaving
my Father's House, and abandoning my Duty; all the good Counsel
of my Parents, my Father's Tears and my Mother's Entreaties came
now fresh into my Mind, and my Conscience, which was not yel
come to the Pitch of Hardness to which it has been since, reproach'd
me with the Contempt of Advice, and the Breach of my Duty to God
and my Father.
All this while the Storm increas'd, and the Sea, which I had never
been upon before, went very high, though nothing like what I have seen
many times since; no, nor like what I saw a few Days after: But it
was enough to affect me then, who was but a young Sailor, and had
never known anything of the matter. I expected every Wave would
have swallowed us up, and that every time the Ship fell down, as 1
thought, in the Trough or Hollow of the Sea, we should never rise
more; and in this Agony of Mind, I made many Vows and Resolu-
tions, that if it would please God here to spare my Life this one
Voyage, if ever I got once my Foot upon dry Land again, I would
go directly home to my Father, and never set it into a Ship again
while I lived; that I would take. his Advice, and never run myself
into such Miseries as these any more. Now I saw plainly the Good-
ness of his Observations about the middle Station of Life, how easy,
how comfortably he had lived all his Days, and never had been ex-
pos'd to Tempests at Sea, or Troubles on Shore; and I resolv'd that
I would, like a true repenting Prodigal, go home to my Father.
These wise and sober Thoughts continued all the while the Storm
continued, and indeed some time after; but the next Day the Wind
was abated and the Sea calmer, and I began to be a little inur'd to
it: However I was very grave for all that Day, being also a little Sea
sick still; but towards Night the Weather cleared up, the Wind was
quite over, and a charming fine Evening follow'd; the Sun went down
perfectly clear and rose so the next Morning; and having little or no
Wind, and a smooth Sea, the Sun shining upon it, the Sight was, as I
thought, the most delightful that ever I saw.
I had slept well in the Night, and was now no more Sea sick but
very cheerful, looking with Wonder upon the Sea that was so rough
and terrible the Day before, and could be so calm and so pleasant in
jo little time after. And now lest my good Resolutions should con-
tinue, my Companion, who had indeed entic'd me away, comes to me,
Well Bob, says he, clapping me on the Shoulder, How do you do after
ti? I warrant you were frighted, wa'n't you, last N'ght, when it blew
but a Capfull of Wind? A Capfull do you call'it? said I, 'twas a
terrible Storm: A Storm, you Fool you, replies he, do you call that a
Storm J why it was nothing at all; give us but a good Ship and Sea
Room, and we think nothing of such a Squall of Wind as that; but you're
but a fresh-water Sailor, Bob; come let us make a Bowl of Punch and
we'll forget all that, d'ye see what charming Weather 'tis now. To
make short this sad Part of my Story, we went the old way of all
Sailors, the Punch was made, and I was made drunk with it, «.nd in
that one Night's Wickedness I drowned all my Repentance, all my
Reflections upon my past Conduct, and all my Resolutions for my
future. In a word, as the Sea was returned to its Smoothness of
Surface and settled Calmness by the Abatement of that Storm, so the
Hurry of my Thoughts being over, my Fears and Apprehensions of
being swallow'd up by the Sea being forgotten, and the Current of
my former Desires return'd, I entirely forgot the Vows and Promises
that I made in my Distress. I found indeed some Intervals of Re-
flection, and the serious Thoughts did, as it were endeavour to return
again sometimes, but I shook them off, and roused myself from them
as it were from a Distemper, and applying myself to Drink and
Company, soon mastered the Return of those Fits, for so I called
them, and I had in five or six Days got as complete a Victory over
Conscience as any young Fellow that resolv'd not to be troubled with
it, could desire: But I was to have another Trial for it still; and
Providence, as in such Cases generally it does, resolv'd to leave me
entirely without Excuse. For if I would not take this for a Delive-
rance, the next was to be such a one as the worst and most harden'd
Wretch among us would confess both the Danger and the Mercy.
The sixth Day of our being at Sea we came into Yarmouth Roads;
the Wind having been contrary, and the Weather calm, we had made
bet little Wa'j since the Storm. Here we were obliged to come to an
Anchor, and here we lay, the Wind continuing contrary, viz. at South-
west, for seven or eight Days, during which time a great many Ships
from Newcastle came into the same Roads, as the common Harbour
where the Ships might wait for a Wind for the River.
We had not however rid here so long, but should have Tided it up
the River, but that the Wind blew too fresh; and after we had lain
four or five Days, blew very hard. However, the Roads being
reckoned as good as a Harbour, the Anchorage good, and our Ground-
Tackle very strong, our Men were unconcerned, and not in the least
apprehensive of Danger, but spent the Time in Rest and Mirth, after
the manner of the Sea; but the eighth Day in the Morning, the Wind
increased, and we had all Hands at Work to strike our Topmasts,
and make everything snug and close, that the Ship might ride as easy
as possible. By Noon '.he Sea went very high indeed, and our Ship
rid Forecastle in, shipped several Seas, and we thought once or twice
our Anchor had come home ; upon which our Master order'd out the
Sheet Anchor; so that we rode with two Anchors a-Head, and the
Cables veered out to the better End.
By this Time it blew a terrible Storm indeed, and now I began to
see Terror and Amazement in the Faces even of the Seamen them-
selves. The Master, though vigilant to the Business of preserving the
Ship, yet as he went in and out of his Cabin by me, I could hear
him softly to himself say several times, Lord be merciful to us, wc shall
be all lost, we shall be all undone; and the like. During these first
Hurries, I was stupid, lying still in my Cabin, which was in the
Steerage, and cannot describe my Temper: I could ill re-assume the
first Penitence, which I had so apparently trampled upon, and harden'd
myself against: I thought the Bitterness of Death had been past,
and that this would be nothing too like the first But when the
Master himself came by me, as I said just now, and said we should
be all lost, I was dreadfully frighted: I got up out of my Cabin,
and looked out; but such a dismal Sight I never saw: The Sea went
Mountains high, and broke upon us every three or four Minutes:
When I could look about, I could see nothing but Distress round
us: Two Ships that rid near us we found had cut their Masts by the
Board, being deep laden; and our Men cried out, that a Ship which
rid about a Mile a-Head of us was foundered. Two more Ships
being driven from their Anchors, were run out of the Roads to Sea
at all Adventures, and that with not a Mast standing. The light
Ships fared the best, as not so much labouring in the Sea; but two
or three of them drove, and came close by us, running away with only
their Sprit-sail out before the Wind.
Towards Evening the Mate and Boatswain begged the Master of
our Ship to let them cut away the Foremast, which he was very
unwilling to: But the Boatswain protesting to him, that if he did
not, the Ship would founder, he consented; and when they had cut
away the Foremast, the Mainmast stood so loose, and shook the
Ship so much, they were obliged to cut her away also, and make a
clear Deck.
Any one may judge what a Condition I must be in at all this, who
was but a young Sailor, and who had been in such a Fright before at
but a littie. But if I can express at this Distance the Thoughts I
had about me at that time, I was in tenfold more Horror of Mind
upon Account of my former Convictions, and the having returned
from them to the Resolutions I had wickedly taken it first, than I
was at Death itself; and these added to the Terror of the Storm,
put me into such a Condition, that I can by no Words describe k.
But the worst was not come yet, the Storm continued with such
Fury, that the Seamen themselves acknowledged they had never
known a worse. We had a good Ship, but she was deep kden, and
wallowed in the Sea, that the Seamen every now and then cried out,
she would founder. It was my Advantage in one respect, that I did
not know what they meant by Founder, till I inquir'd. However,
the Storm was so violent, that I saw what is not often seen, the
Master, the Boatswain, and some others more sensible than the rest,
at their Prayers, and expecting every Moment when the Ship would
go to the Bottom. In the Middle of the Night, and under all the
rest of our Distresses, one of the Men that had been down on
Purpose to see, cried out we had sprung a Leak; another said there
was four Foot Water in the Hold. Then all Hands were called to the
Pump. At that very Word my Heart, as I thought, died within me,
and I fell backwards upon the Side of my Bed where I sat, into the
Cabin. However, the Men roused me, and told me, that I that was
able to do nothing before, was as well able to pump as another; at which
I stirred up, and went to the Pump and worked very heartily. While
this was doing, the Master seeing some light Colliers, who not able to
ride out the Storm, were oblig'd to slip and run away to Sea, and would
come near us, ordered to fire a Gun as a Signal of Distress. I who
knew nothing what that meant, was so surprised, that I thought the Ship
had broke, or some dreadful thing had happened. In a word, I was
so surprised, that I fell down in a Swoon. As this was a time when
everybody had his own Life to think of, nobody minded me, or
what was become of me; but another Man stepped up to the Pump,
and thrusting me aside with his Foot, let me lie, thinking I had been
dead; and it was a great while before I came to myself.
We worked on, but the Water increasing in the Hold, it was appa-
rent that the Ship would founder, and though the Storm began to abate
a little, yet as it was not possible she could swim till we might run
into a Port, so the Master continued firing Guns for Help; and a
light Ship, who had rid it out just a-Head of us ventured a Boat out
to help us. It was with the utmost Hazard the Boat came near us,
but it was impossible for us to get on Board, or for the Boat to lie
near the Ship Side, till at last the Men rowing very heartily, and ven-
turing their Lives to save ours, our Men cast them a Rope over the
Stern with a Buoy to it, and then veered it out a great Length, which
they after great Labour and Hazard took hold of and we hauled them
close under our Stern, and got all into their Boat It was to no
Purpose for them or us after we were in the Boat to think of reaching
to their own Ship, so all agreed to let her drive and only to pull her in
towards Shore as much as we could, and our Master promised them.
That if the Boat was staved upon Shore he would make it good to
their Master, so partly rowing and partly driving, our Boat went away
to the Norward sloping towards the Shore almost as far as Winter-
ton Ness.
We were not much more than a quarter of an Hour out of our Ship
but we saw her sink, and then I understood for the first time what
was meant by a Ship foundering in the Sea; I must acknowledge 1
had hardly Eyes to look up when the Seamen told me she was sink-
ing; for from that Moment they rather put me into the Boat than
that I might be said to go in, my Heart was as it were dead within
me, partly with Fright, partly with Horror of Mind and the Thoughts
of what was yet before me.
While we were in this Condition, the Men yet labouring at the Oar to
bring the Boat near the Shore, we could see, when our Boat mounting
the Waves, we were able to see the Shore, a great many People run-
ning along the Shore to assist us when we should come near, but we
made but slow way towards the Shore, nor were we able to reach the
Shore, till being past the Lighthouse at Winterton, the Shore falls ofl
to the Westward towards Cromer, and so the Land broke off a little
the Violence of the Wind: Here we got in, and though not without
much Difficulty got all safe on Shore and walked afterwards on Foot
to Yarmouth, where, as unfortunate Men, we were used with great
Humanity as well by the Magistrates of the Town, who assign'd us
good Quarters, as by particular Merchants and Owners of Ships, and
had Money given us sufficient to carry us either to London or back tc
Hull, as we thought fit
Had I now had the Sense to have gone back to Hull, and have
gone home, I had been happy, and my Father, an Emblem of our
Blessed Saviour's Parable, had even killed the fatted Calf for me; for
hearing the Ship I went away in was cast away in Yarmouth Road, it
was a great while before he had any Assurance that I was not drowned.
But my ill Fate pushed me on now with an Obstinacy that nothing
could resist; and though I had several times loud Calls from my Reason
and my more composed Judgment to go home, yet I had no Power to
do it 1 know not what to call this, nor will I urge, that it is a secret
over-ruling Decree that hurries us on to be the Instruments of our
own Destruction, even though it be before us, and that we rush upon it
with our Eyes open. Certainly nothing but some such decreed una-
voidable Misery attending, and which it was impossible for me to
escape, could have pushed roe forward against the calm Reasonings
and Persuasions of my most retired Thoughts, and against two such
visible Instructions as I had met with in my first Attempt
My Comrade, who had helped to harden me before, and who was
the Master's Son, was now less forward than I; the first time he
spoke to me after we were at Yarmouth, which was not till two or
three Days, for we were separated in the Town to several Quarters;
I say, the first time he saw me, it appear'd his Tone was altef'd,
and looking very melancholy and shaking his Head, asked me how I
did, and telling his Father who I was, and how I had come this
Voyage only for a Trial in order to go farther abroad; his Father
turning to me with a very grave and concern'd Tone, Young Man,
says he, you ought never to go to Sea any more, you ought to take this
for a plain and visible Token that you are not to be a Seafaring Man,
why Sir, said I, will you go to Sea no more? That is another Case,
said fee 3 it is my Calling, and therefore my Duty; but as you made
this Voyage for a Trial, you see what a Taste Heaven has given
you of what you are to expect if you persist; perhaps this is all befallen
us on your Account, like Jonah in the ship of Taxsbish. Pray, continues
he, what are you? and on what Account did you go to Sea? Upon
that I told him some of my Story; at the End of which he burst out
with a strange kind of Passion, What had I done, says he, that such
an unhappy Wretch should come into my Ship? I would not set my
Foot in the same Ship with thee again for a Thousand Pbunds.
This indeed was, as I said, an Excursion of his Spirits which were
yet agitated by the Sense of his Loss, and was farther than he could
have Authority to go. However he afterwards talked very gravely to
me, exhorted me to go back to my Father, and not tempt Provi-
dence to my Ruin; told me I might see a visible Hand of Heaven
against me, And young Man, said he, depend upon it, if you do not go
back, wherez'er you go, you will meet with nothing but Disasters and
Disappointments, till your Fat'her's Words are fulfilled upon you.
We parted soon after; for I made him little Answer, and I saw
him no more; which way he went, I know not As for me, having
some Money in my Pocket, I travelled to London by Land; and
there, as well as on the Road, had many Struggles with myself, what
Course of Life I should take, and whether I should go Home, or go
to Sea.
As to going Home, Shame opposed the best Motions that offered
to my Thoughts; and it immediately occurr'd to me how I should be
laughed at among the Neighbours, and should be asham'd to see, not
my Father and Mother only, but even everybody else; from whence
I have since often observed, how incongruous and irrational the com-
mon Temper of Mankind is, especially of Youth, to that Reason
which ought to guide them in such Cases, viz. That they are not
asham'd to sin, and yet are asham'd to repent; not asham'd of the
Action for which they ought justly to be esteemed Fools, but are
asham'd of the returning, which only can make them be esteem'd
wise Men.
In this State of Life however I remained some time, uncertain
what Measures to take, and what Course of Life to lead. An irresis-
tible Reluctance continu'd to going Home; and as I stayed a while,
the Remembrance of the Distress I had been in wore off; and aa
that abated, the little Motion I had in my Desires to a Return wore
off with it, till at last I quite laid aside the Thoughts of it, and looked
out for a Voyage.
That evil Influence which carried me first away from my Father's
House, that hurried me into the wild and indigested Notion of raising
my Fortune; and that impress'd those Conceits so forcibly upon me,
as to make me deaf to all good Advice, and to the Entreaties and
even Command of my Father: I say the same Influence, whatever
it was, presented the most unfortunate of all Enterprises to my View;
and I went on board a Vessel bound to the Coast of Africa; or, as
our Sailors vulgarly call it, a Voyage to Guinea.
It was my great Misfortune that in all these Adventures I did not
ship myself as a Sailor; whereby, though I might indeed have worked a
little harder than ordinary, yet at the same time I had learned the
Duty and Office of a Foremast Man; and in time might have
qualified myself for a Mate or Lieutenant, if not for a Master: But
as it was always my Fate to choose for the worst, so I did here; for
having Money in my Pocket, and good Clothes upon my Back, I
would always go on board in the Habit of a Gentleman; and so I
neither had any Business in the Ship, or learned to do any.
It was my Lot first of all to fall into pretty good Company in
London, which does not always happen to such loose and unguided
young Fellows as I then was; the Devil generally not omitting to lay
some Snare for them very early: But it was not so with me, I first
fell acquainted with the Master of a Ship who had been on the Coas;
of Guinea; and who having had very good Success there, was re
solved to go again; and who taking a Fancy to my Conversatior ,
which was not at all disagreeable at that time, hearing me say I ha.i
a mind to see the World, told me if I would go the Voyage with him
I should be at no Expense; I should be his Messmate and his Com-
panion, and if I could carry anything with me, I should have all the
Advantage of it that the Trade would admit; and perhaps I might
meet with some Encouragement
I embrac'd the Offer, and entering into a strict Friendship with
this Captain, who was an honest and plain-dealing Man, I went the
Voyage with him, and carried a small Adventure with me, which by
the disinterested Honesty of my Friend the Captain, I increased very
considerably; for I carried about 40/. in such Toys and Trifles as
the Captain directed me to buy. This 40/. I had mustered together
by the Assistance of some of my Relations whom I corresponded
with, and who, I believe, got my Father, or at least my Mother, to
contribute so much as that to my first Adventure.
This was the only Voyage, which I may say was successful in all
my Adventures, and which I owe to the Integrity and Honesty of my
Friend the Captain, under whom also I got a competent Knowledge
of the Mathematics and the Rules of Navigation, learned how to keep
an Account of the Ship's Course, take an Observation; and in short,
to understand some things that were needful to be understood by a
Sailor: For, as he took Delight to introduce me, I took Delight to
learn; and, in a word, this Voyage made me both a Sailor and a
Merchant: for I brought home 5 Pounds 9 Ounces of Gold Dust for my
Adventure, which yielded me in London at my Return, almost 300/.
and this filled me with those aspiring Thoughts which have since so
completed my Ruin.
Yet even in this Voyage I had my Misfortunes too; particularly,
that I was continually sick, being thrown into a violent Calenture by the
excessive Heat of the Climate; our principal Trading being upon the
Coast, from the Latitude of 15 Degrees North even to the Line itself.
I was now set up for a Guinea Trader; and my Friend, to my
great Misfortune, dying soon after his Arrival, I resolved to go the
same Voyage again, and I embark'd in the same Vessel with one who
was his Mate in the former Voyage, and had now got the Command
of the Ship. This was the unhappiest Voyage that ever Man made;
for though I did not carry quite 100/. of my new gained Wealth, so that
I had 200 left, and which I lodged with my Friend's Widow, who was
very just to me, yet I fell into terrible Misfortunes in this Voyage;
and the first was this, viz. Our Ship making her Course towards the
Canary Islands, or rather between those Islands and the African
Shore, was surprised in the Grey of the Morning, by a Turkish Rover
of Sallee, who gave Chase to us with all the Sail she could make. We
crowded also as much Canvas as our Yards would spread, .or our
Masts carry, to have got clear; but finding the Pirate gained upon us,
and would certainly come up with us in a few Hours, we prepared to
fight; our Ship having 1 a Guns, and the Rogue 18. About three in
the Afternoon he came up with us, and bringing to by Mistake, just
athwart our Quarter, instead of athwart our Stern, as he intended, we
brought 8 of our Guns to bear on that Side, and poured in a Broadside
upon him, which made him sheer off again, after returning our Fire,
and pouring in also his small Shot from near 200 Men which he had
on Board. However, we had not a Man touched, all our Men keeping
close. He prepar'd to attack us again, »v\ we tf> defend ourselves;
but laying us on Board the next time upon our ether Quarter, he
entered 60 Men upon our Decks, who immediately fell to cutting and
hacking the Decks and Rigging. We plied them with Small-shot,
Half-Pikes, Powder-Chests, and such like, and cleared our Deck of
them twice. However, to cut short this melancholy Part of our
Story, our Ship being disabled, and three of our Men killed, and eight
wounded, we were obliged to yield, and were carried all Prisoners
into Sallee, a Port belonging to the Moors.
The Usage I had there was not so dreadful as at first I apprehended,
nor was I carried up the Country to the Emperor's Court, as the rest
of our Men were, but was kept by the Captain of the Rover, as his
proper Prize, and made his Slave, being young and nimble, and fit for
his Business. At this surprising Change of my Circumstances from a
Merchant to a miserable Slave, I was perfectly overwhelmed; and
now I looked back upon my Father's prophetic Discourse to me, that
I should be miserable, and have none to relieve me, which I thought
was now so effectually brought to pass, that it could not be worse;
that now the Hand of Heaven had overtaken me, and I was undone
without Redemption. But alas! this was but a Taste of the Misery
I was to go through, as will appear in the Sequel of this Story.
As my new Patron or Master had taken me Home to his House, so
I was in hopes that he would take me with him when he went to Sea
again, believing that it would some time or other be his Fate to be
taken by a Spanish or Portugal Man of War; and that then I should
be set at Liberty. But this Hope of mine was soon taken away; for
when he went to Sea, he left me on Shore to look after his little Gar-
den, and do the common Drudgery of Slaves about his House; and
when he came home again from his Cruise, he order'd me to lie in the
Cabin to look after the Ship.
Here I meditated nothing but my Escape; and what Method I
might take to effect it, but found no Way that had the least Probabi-
lity in it: Nothing presented to make the Supposition of it rational;
for I had nobody to communicate it to, that would embark with me;
no Fellow-Slave, no Englishman, Irishman, or Scotsman there but my-
self; so that for two Years, though I often pleased myself with the Im-
agination, yet I never had the least encouraging Prospect of putting
it in Practice.
After about two Years an odd Circumstance presented itself, which
pnt the old Thought of making some Attempt for my Liberty, again
in my Head: My Patron lying at Home longer than usual, without
fitting out his Ship, which, as I heard, was for want of Money; he
used constantly, once or twice a Week, sometimes oftener, if the
Weather was fair, to take the Ship's Pinnace, and go out into the
Road a fishing; and as he always took me and a young Maresco
with him to row the Boat, we made him very merry, and I proved very
dexterous in catching Fish; insomuch that sometimes he would sen?
me with a Moor, one of his Kinsmen, and the Youth the Maresco, a
they called him, to catch a Dish of Fish for him.
It happen'd one time, that going a fishing in a stark calm Mor
n
ing, a Fog rose so thick, that though we were not half a League from the
Shore we lost Sight of it; and rowing we knew not whither or which
way, we labour'd all Day and all the next Night, and when the Morn-
ing came we found we had pulled off to Sea instead of pulling in for
the Shore; and that we were at least two Leagues from the Shore:
However we got well in again, though with a great deal of Labour, and
some Danger; for the Wind began to blow pretty fresh in the Morn-
ing; but particularly we were all very hungry.
But our Patron warned by this Disaster, resolved to take more
Care of himself for the future; and having lying by him the Long-
boat of our English Ship »ve had taken, he resolved he would not
go a fishing any more without a Compass and some Provision; so
he order'd the Carpenter of his Ship, who also was an English Slave,
to build a little State-room or Cabin in the middle of the Long Boat,
like that of a Barge, with a Place to stand behind it to steer and
hale home the Main-sheet; and Room before for a hand or two to
stand and work the Sails; she sailed with that we call a Shoulder of
Mutton Sail; and the Boom gibbed over the Top of the Cabin, which
lay very snug and low, and had in it Room for him to lie, with a
Slave or two, and a Table to eat on, with some small Lockers to put
in some Bottles of such Liquor as he thought fit to drink in; particu-
larly his Bread, Rice and Coffee.
We went frequently out with this Boat a fishing, and as I was
most dexterous to catch fish for him, he never went without me: It
happen'd that he had appointed to go out in this Boat, either for
Pleasure or for Fish, with two or three Moors of some Distinction in
that Place, and for whom he had provided extraordinarily; and had
therefore sent on board the Boat over Night, a larger Store of Provv
sions than ordinary; and had order'd me to get ready three Fuzees
with Powder and Shot, which were on board his Ship; for that they
design'd some Sport of Fowling as well as Fishing.
I got all things ready as he had directed, and waited the next
Morning with the Boat, washed clean, her Ancient and Pendants
out, and everything to accommodate his Guests; when by and by my
Patron came on board alone, and told me his Guests had put off
going, upon some Business that fell out, and order'd me with the
Man and Boy, as usual, to go out with the Boat and catch them some
Fish, for that his Friends were to sup at his House; and commanded
that as soon as I had got some Fish I should bring it home to his
House; all which I prepar'd to do.
This Moment my former Notions of Deliverance darted into my
Thoughts, for now I found I was like to have a little Ship at my
Command; and my Master being gone, I prepar'd to furnish my-
self, not for a fishing Business, but for a Voyage; though I knew not,
neither did I so much as consider whither I should steer; for any-
where to get out of that Place was my Way.
My first Contrivance was to make a Pretence to speak to this
Moor, to get something for our Subsistence on board; for I told him
we must not presume to eat of our Patron's Bread, he said, that
was true; so he brought a large Basket of Rusk or Biscuit of their
kind, and three Jars with fresh Water into the Boat; I knew where
my Patron's Case of Bottles stood, which it was evident by the
make were taken out of some English Prize; and I convey'd them
into the Boat while the Moor was on Shore, as if they had been there
before, for our Master: I convey'd also a great Lump of Bees-Wax
into the Boat, which weighed above half a Hundred Weight, with a
Parcel of Twine or Thread, a Hatchet, a Saw and a Hammer, all
which were of great Use to us afterwards; especially the Wax to
make Candles. Another Trick I tried upon him, which he inno-
cently came into also; his Name was Ismael, who they call Muly, or
Moely, so I called to him, Moely said I, our Patron's Guns are on
board the Boat, can you not get a little Powder and Shot, it may be
we may kill some Akamies (a Fowl like our Curlews) for ourselves,
for I know he keeps the Gunner's Stores in the Ship? Yes, says he,
HI bring some, and accordingly he brought a great Leather Pouch
which held about a Pound and half of Powder, or rather more;
*nd another with Shot, that had five or six Pound, with some Bullett -
and put all into the Boat: At the same time I had found some
Powder of my Master's in the Great Cabin, with which I filled one
of the large Bottles in the Case, which was almost empty; pouring
what was in it into another: and thus furnished with everything
needful, we sailed out of the Port to fish: The Castle which is at the
Entrance of the Port knew who we were, and took no Notice of us;
and we were not above a Mile out of the Port before we hauled in our
Sail, and set us down to fish: The Wind blew from the N.N.E.
which was contrary to my Desire; for had it blown southerly I had been
sure to have made the Coast of Spain, and at least reached to the Bay of
Cadiz; but my Resolutions were, blow which way it would, I would
be gone from that horrid Place where I was, and leave the rest to Fate.
After we had fished some time and catched nothing, for when I had
Fish on my Hook, I would not pull them up, that he might not see
them; I said to the Moor, this will not do, our Master will not be
thus served, we must stand farther off: He thinking no harm, agreed;
and being in the head of the Boat set the Sails; and as I had the
Helm I run the Boat out near a League farther, and then brought her
to as if I would fish; when giving the Boy the Helm, I stepped
forward to where the Moor was, and making as if I stooped for some-
thing behind him, I took him by Surprize with my Arm under his
Twist, and tossed him clear overboard into the Sea; he rose im-
mediately, for he swam like a Cork, and called to me, begged to be
taken in, told me he would go all over the World with me; he swam
so strong after the Boat that he would have reached me very quickly,
there being but little Wind; upon which I stepped into the Cabin, and
fetching one of the Fowling-pieces, I presented it at him, and told
him, I had done him no hurt, and if he would be quiet I would do
him none; but said I, you swim well enough to reach to the Shore, and
the Sea is calm, make the best of your Way to Shore and I will do
you no harm, but if you come near the Boat I'll shoot you through'
the Head; for I am resolved to have my Liberty; so he turned
himself about and swam for the Shore, and I make no doubt but he
reached it with Ease, for he was an Excellent Swimmer.
I could have been content to have taken this Moor with me, and
have drowned the Boy, but there was no venturing to trust him:
When he was gone I turned to the Boy, who they called Xury, and
said to him, Xury, if you will be faithful to me I'll make you a great
Man, but if you will not stroke your Face to be true to me, that is,
wear by Mahomet and his Father's Beard, I must throw you into the
Sea; the Boy smiled in my Face, and spoke so innocently that 1
could not mistrust him; and swore to be faithful to me, and go all
over the World with me.
While I was in View of the Moor that was swimming, I stood out
directly to Sea with the Boat, rather stretching to Windward, that
they might think me gone towards the Straits-mouth (as indeed
any one that had been in their Wits must have been suppos'd to do)
for who would have suppos'd we were sailed on to the southward to
the truly Barbarian Coast, where whole Nations of Negroes were
sure to surround us with their Canoes, and destroy us; where we
could never once go on Shore but we should be devour'd by savage
Beasts, or more merciless Savages of human kind.
But as soon as it grew dusk in the Evening, I changed my Course,
and steered directly South and by East, bending my Course a little
toward the East, that I might keep in with the Shore; and having a
fair fresh Gale of Wind, and a smooth quiet Sea, I made such Sail
that I believe by the next Day at Three o'Clock in the Afternoon,
wher. I frst made the Land, I could not be less than 150 Miles
South of Sallee; quite beyond the Emperor of Morocco's Dominions,
or indeed of any other King thereabouts, for we saw no People.
Yet such was the Fright I had taken at the Moors, and the dreadful
Apprehensions I had of falling into their Hands, that I would not
stop, or go en Shore, or come to an Anchor; the Wind continuing
fair, until I had sailed in that manner five Days: And then the Wind
shifting to the southward, I concluded also that if any of our Vessels
'sere in Chase of me, they also would now give over; so I ventur'd to
make to *he Coast, and came to an Anchor in the Mouth of a little
River, I knew not what, or where; neither what Latitude, what
Country, what Nations, or what River: I neither saw, or desir'd to see
any People, the principal thing I wanted was fresh Water: We came
into this Creek in the Evening, resolving to swim on Shore as soon as
it was dark, zxA discover the Country; but as soon as it was quite
dark, we heard such dreadful Noises of the Barking, Roaring, and
Howling of Wild Creatures, of we knew not what Kinds, that the poor
Boy was ready to die with Fear, and begged of me not to go on Shore
till Day; well Xury, said I, then I wont, but it may be we may see
Men by Day, who will be as bad to us as those Lions; then we givi
them the shoot Gun, says Xury, laughing, make them run wey; such
English Xury spoke by conversing among as Slaves, however I was
glad to see the Boy so cheerful, and I gave him a Dram (out of oui
Patron's Case of Bottles) to cheer him up: After all, Xury's Advice
was good, and I took it, we dropped our little Anchor and lay still all
Night; I say still., for we slept none! for in two or three Hours we
saw vast great Creatures (we knew not what to call them) of many
torts, come down to the Sea-shore and run into the Water, wallowing
and washing themselves for the Pleasure of cooling themselves) and
they made such hideous Howiings and Yellings, that I never indeed
heard the like.
Xury was dreadfully frighted, and indeed so was I too; but we
were both more frighted when we heard one of these mighty Creatures
come swimming towards our Boat, we could not see him, but we
might hear him by his blowing to be a monstrous, huge and furious
Beast; Xury said it was a Lion, and it might be so for ought I know;
but poor Xury cried to me to weigh the Anchor and row away; no,
says I, Xury, we can slip our Cable with the Buoy to it and go off to
Sea, they cannot follow us far; I had no sooner said so, but I per-
ceiv'd the Creature (whatever it was) within Two Oars' Length, which
something surprized me; however I immediately stepped to the Cabin-
door, and taking up my Gun fired at him, upon which he immediately
turned about and swam towards the Shore again.
But it is impossible to desrribe the horrible Noises, and hideous
Cries and Howiings, that were raised as well upon the Edge of the
Shore, as higher within the Country; upon the Noise or Report of the
Gun, a Thing I have some Reason to believe those Creatures had
never heard before: This Convinc'd me that there was no going on
Shore for us in the Night upon that Coast, and how to venture on
Shore in the Day was another Question too; for to have fallen into
the Hands of any of the Savages, had been as bad as to have fallen
into the Hands of Lions and Tigers; at least we were equally appre-
hensive of the Danger of it
Be that as it would, we were oblig'd to go on Shore somewhere or
other for Water, for we had not a Pint left in the Boat; when or
where to get to it was the Point: Xury said, if I would let him go on
Shore with one of the Jars, he would find if there was any Water and
bring some to me. I asked him why he would go? Why I should not
go and he stay in the* Boat? The Boy answer'd with so much Affection
that made me love him ever after. Says he, If wild Mans come, they
•at me, you go wey. Well, Xury, said I, we will both go, and if the
11
wild Mans come, we will kill them, they shall Eat neither of us; so 1
gave Xury a piece of Rusk-bread to Eat, and a Drum out of oui
Patron's Case of Bottles which I mentioned before; and we hauled
the Boat in as near the Shore as we thought was proper, and so
waded on Shore, carrying nothing but our Arms and two Jars for
Water.
I did not care to go out of Sight of the Boat, fearing the coming of
Canoes with Savages down the River; but the Boy seeing a low Place
about a Mile up the Country rambled to it; and by and by I saw
him come running towards me, I thought he was pursued by some
Savage, or frighted with some wild Beast, and I run forward to-
wards him to help him, but when I came nearer to him, I saw some-
thing hanging over his Shoulders which was a Creature that he had
shot, like a Hare but different in Colour, and longer Legs, however

we were very glad of it, and it was very good Meat; but the great
Joy that poor Xury came with, was to tell me he had found good
Water and seen no wild Mans.
But we found afterwards that we need not take such Pains for
Water, for a little higher up the Creek where we were, we found the
Water fresh when the tide was out, which flowed but a little way up;
so we filled our Jars and feasted on the Hare we had killed, and
prepared to go on our Way, having seen no Footsteps of any human
Creature in that part of the Country.
As I had been one Voyage to this Coast before, I knew very well
that the Islands of the Canaries, and the Cape de Verd Islands also,
lay not far off from the coast But as I had no Instruments to take
an Observation to know what Latitude we were in, and did not
exactly know, or at least remember what Latitude they were in; I
knew not where to look for them, or when to stand off to Sea to-
wards them; otherwise I might now easily have found some of these
Islands. But my hope was, that if I stood along this Coast till I
came to that Part where the English Traded, I should find some of
their Vessels upon their usual Design of Trade, that would relieve
and take us in.
By the best of my Calculation, that Place where I now was, must
be that Country, which lying between the Emperor of Morocco's Do-
minions and the Negroes, lies waste and uninhabited, except by wild
Beasts; the Negroes having abandon'd it and gone farther South for
fear of the Moors; and the Moors not thinking it worth inhabiting,
by reason of its Barrenness; and indeed both forsaking it because of
the prodigious Numbers of Tigers, Lions, Leopards and other
furious Creatures which harbour there; so that the Moors use it for
their Hunting only, where they go like an Army, two or three thousand
Men at a time; and indeed for near an hundred Miles together, upon
this Coast, we saw nothing but a waste uninhabited Country, by Day;
and heard nothing but Howlings and Roaring of wild Beasts, by
Night
Once or twice in the Daytime, I thought I saw the Pico of Tcne-
riffe, being the high top of the Mountain Teneriffe in the Canaries;
and had a great mind to venture out in hopes of reaching thither;
but having tried twice I was forced in again by contrary Winds, the
Sea also going too high for my little Vessel, so I resolved to pursue
my first Design and keep along the Shore.
Several times I was obliged to land for fresh Water, after we had
left this Place; and once in particular, being early in the Morning,
we came to an Anchor under a little Point of Land which was pretty
high, and the Tide beginning to flow, we lay still to go farther in;
Xury, whose Eyes were more about him than it seems mine were,
calls softly to me, and tells me that we had best go farther off the
Shore; for, says he, look yonder lies a dreadful Monster on the side
of that Hillock fast asleep: I looked where he pointed, and saw a
dreadful Monster indeed, for it was a terrible great Lion that lay on
the Side of the Shore, under the Shade of a Piece of the Hill tliat
hung as it were a little over him. Xury, says I, you shall go on
Shore and kill him; Xltry looked frighted, and said, Me kill I he
tat me at one Mouth; one Mouthful he meant; however, I said no
more to the Boy, but bad him lie still, and I took our biggest Gun,
which was almost Musket-bore, and loaded it with a good Charge
of Powder, and with two Slugs; and laid it down; then I loaded
another Gun with two Bullets, and the third, for we had three Pieces,
I loaded with five smaller Bullets. I took the best aim I could with
the first Piece to have shot him into the Head, but he lay so with his
Leg raised a little above his Nose, that the Slugs hit his Leg about
the.Knee, and broke the Bone. He started up growling at first, but
finding his Leg broke fell down again, and then got up upon thiee
Legs and gave the most hideous Roar that ever I heard; I was a
little surpriz'd that I had not hit him on the Head; however I too)
up the second Piece immediately, and though he began to move off fired
again, and shot him into the Head, and had the Pleasure to see him
drop, and make but little Noise, but lay struggling for Life. Then
Xury took Hea±t, and would have me let him go on Shore: Well,
go said I, so the Boy jumped into the Water, and taking a little Gun
in one Hand, swam to Shore with the other Hand, and coming close
to the Creature, put the Muzzle of the Piece to his Ear, and shot
him into the head again, which despatch'd him quite.
This was Game indeed to us, but this was no Food, and I was very
sorry to lose three Charges of Powder and Shot upon a Creature that
was good for nothing to us. However Xury said he would have some
of him; so he comes on board, and asked me to give him the Hat-
chet; for what, Xury, said I? Me cut ojff his Head, said he. How-
ever Xury could not cut off his Head, but he cut off a Foot and
brought it with him, and it was a monstrous great one.
I bethought myself however, that perhaps the Skin of him might
i ne way or other be of some Value to us; and I resolved to take ofl
liis Skin if I could. So Xury and I went to work with him, but Xury
was much the better Workman at it, for I knew very ill how to
do it Indeed it took us up both the whole Day, but at last we got
off the Hide of him, and spreading it on the top of our Cabin, the
Sun effectually dried it in two Days' time, and it afterwards served me
to lie upon.
After this Stop we made on to the Southward continually for ten
or twelve Days, living very sparing on our Provisions, wnich began to
abate very much, and going no oftener into the Shore than we were
oblig'd to for fresh Water; my Design in this was to make the River
Gambia or Senegall, that is to say, anywhere about the Cape de Verd,
where I was in hopes to meet with some European Ship, and if I did
u
not, I knew not what Course I had to take, but to seek out for the
Islands, or perish there among the Negroes. I knew that all the Ships
from Europe, which sailed either to the Coast of Guinea, or to Brasil,
or to the East Indies, made this Cape, or those Islands; and in a
word, I put the whole of my Fortune upon this single Point, either
that I must meet with some Ship, or must perish.
When I had pursued this Resolution about ten Days longer, as I have
said, I began to see that the Land was inhabited, and in two or three
Places, as we sailed by, we saw People stand upon the Shore to look
at us, we could also perceive they were quite Black and Stark naked.
I was once inclin'd to have gone on Shore to them ; but Xury was my
better Counsellor, and said tome, no go, no go; however I hauled in
nearer the Shore, that I might talk to them, and I found they ran
along the Shore by me a good way; I obseiVd they had no Weapons
in their Hands, except one who had a long slender Stick, which Xury
said was a Lance, and that they would throw them a great way with
good aim; so I kept at a distance, but talked with them by Signs as
well as I could; and particularly made Signs for something to Eat,
they beckon'd to me to stop my Boat, and that they would fetch me
some Meat; upon this I lower'd the top of my Sail, and lay by, and
two of them run up into the Country, and in less than half an
Hour came back and brought with them two Pieces of dry Flesh and
some Corn, such as is the Produce of their Country, but we neither
knew what the one or the other was; however we were willing to
accept it, but how to come at it was our next Dispute, for I was not
for venturing on Shore to them, and they were as much afraid of us;
but they took a safe way for us all, for they brought it to the Shore
and laid it down, and went and stood a great way off till we fetched
it on Board, and then came close to us again.
We made Signs of Thanks to them, for we had nothing to make
them amends; but an Opportunity offer'd that very Instant to oblige
them wonderfully, for while we were lying by the Shore, came two
mighty Creatures, one pursuing the other, (as we took it) with great
Fury, from the Mountains towards the Sea; whether it was the Male
pursuing the Female, or whether they were in Sport or in Rage, we
could not tell, any more than we could tell whether it was usual or
strange, but I believe it was the latter; because in the first Place,
those ravenous Creatures seldom appear but in the Night; and in
Ae second Place, we found the People terribly frighted, especially
25
the Women. The Man that had the Lance or Dart did not fly
from them, but the rest did; however as the two Creatures ran
directly into the Water, they did not seem to offer to fall upcn any of
the Negroes, but plunged themselves into the Sea and swam about as
if they had come for their Diversion; at last one of them began to
come nearer our Boat than at first I expected, but I lay ready for him,
for I had loaded my Gun with all possible Expedition, and bad Xury
load both the other; as soon as he came fairly within my reach, I
fired, and shot him directly into the Head; immediately he sunk down
into the Water, but rose instantly and plunged up and down as if he
was struggling for Life; and so indeed he was, he immediately made
to the Shore, but between the Wound which was his mortal Hurt,
and the strangling of the Water, he died just before he reached the
Shore.
It is impossible to express the Astonishment of these poor Creatures
at the Noise and the Fire of my Gun; some of them were even ready
to die for Fear, and fell down as Dead with the very Terror. But
when they saw the Creature dead and sunk in the Water, and that I
made Signs to them to come to the Shore; they took Heart and came
to the Shore and began to search for the Creature, I found him by
his Blood staining the Water, and by the help of a Rope which I
slung round him and gave the Negroes to haul, they dragged him on
Shore, and found that it was a most curious Leopard, spotted and
fine to an admirable Degree, and the Negroes held up their Hands
with Admiration to think what it was I had killed him with.
The other Creature frighted with the flash of Fire and the Noise of
the Gun swam on Shore, and ran up directly to the Mountains from
whence they came, nor could I at that Distance know what it was.
I found quickly the Negroes were for eating the Flesh of this Creature,
so I was willing to have them take it as a Favour from me, which
when I made Signs to them that they might take it, they were very
thankful for, immediately they fell to work with him, and though they
had no Knife, yet with a sharpen'd Piece of Wood they took off his
Skin as readily, and much more readily than we could have done with
a Knife; they offer'd me some of the Flesh, which I declined, making
as if I would give it them, but made Signs for the Skin, which they
gave me very freely, and brought me a great deal more of their Pro-
vision, which though I did not understand, yet I accepted; then I made
Signs to them tor some Water, and held out one of my Jars to them,
turning it bottom upward, to show that it was empty, and that I wanted
to have it filled. They called immediately to some of their Friends,
and there came two Women and brought a great Vessel made of
^arth, and burnt as I suppose in the Sun; this they set down for me,
as before, and I sent Xury on Shore with my Jars, and filled them
all three. The Women were as stark Naked as the Men.
I was now furnished with Roots and Corn, such as it was, and
Water, and leaving my friendly Negroes, I made forward for about
eleven Days more without offering to go near the Shore, till I saw the
Land run out a great Length into the Sea, at about the Distance of
four or five Leagues before me, and the Sea being very calm I kept a
large offing to make this Point; at length, doubling the Point at about
two Leagues from the Land, I saw plainly Land on the other Side to
Seaward; then I concluded, as it was most certain indeed, that this
was the Cape de Verd, and those the Islands, call'd from thence Cape
de Verd Islands. However they were at a great Distance, and I could
not well tell what I had best to do, for if I should be taken with a
Fresh of Wind I might neither reach one or other.
In this Dilemma, as I was very pensive, I stepped into the Cabin and
sat me down, Xury having the Helm, when on a sudden, the Boy cried
out, Master, Master, a Ship with a Sail, and the foolish Boy was
frighted out of his Wits, thinking it must needs be some of his
Master's Ships sent to pursue us, when I knew we were gotten far
enough out of their reach. I jumped out of the Cabin, and imme-
diately saw not only the Ship, but what she was, (viz.) that it was a
Portuguese Ship, and as I thought was bound to the Coast of Guinea
for Negroes. But when I observ'd the Course she steered, I was soon
convinc'd they were bound some other way, and did not design to
tome any nearer to the Shore; upon which I stretched out to Sea as
much as I could, resolving to speak with them if possible.
With all the Sail I could make, I found I should not be able to
come in their Way, but that they would be gone by, before I could
make any Signal to them; but after I had crowded to the utmost
Hid began to despair, they it seems saw me by the help of their Per-
spective-Glasses, and that it was some European Boat, which as they
supposed must belong to some Ship that was lost, so they shortened
Sail to let me come up. I was encouraged with this, and as I had my
Patron's Ancient on Board, I made a Waft of it to them for a Signal
of Distress, and fired a Gun, both which they saw, for they told me
they saw the Smoke, though they did not hear the Gun; upon these
Signals they very kindly brought too, and lay by for me, and in about
three Hours' time I came up with them.
They asked me what I was, in Portuguese, and in Spanish, and in
French, but I understood none of them; but at last a Scots Sailor
who was on board, called to me, and I answer'd him, and told him I
was an Englishman, that I had made my escape out of Slavery from
the Moors at Sallee; then they bade me come on board, and very
kindly took me in, and all my Goods.
It was an inexpressible Joy to me, that any one will believe, that I
was thus deliver'd, as I esteem'd it, from such a miserable and almost
hopeless Condition as I was in, and I immediately offered all I had
to the Captain of the Ship, as a Return for my, Deliverance; but he
generously told me, he would take nothing from me, but that all I
had should be deliver'd safe to me when I came to the Brasils, for
says he, / have saved your Life on no other Terms than I would be glad
to be saved myself, and it may one time or other be my Lot to be taken
up in the same Condition; besides, said he, when I carry you to the
Brasils, so great a way from your own Country, if I should take from
you what you have, you will be starved there, and then I only take away
that Life I have given. No, no, Seignor Inglese, says he, Mr. English-
man, I will carry you thither in Charity, and those things will help you to
buy your Subsistence there and your Passage home again.
As he was Charitable in his Proposal, so he was Just in the Perfor-
mance to a tittle, for he ordered the Seamen that none should offer to
touch anything I had; then he took everything into his own Posses-
sion, and gave me back an exact Inventory of them, that I might have
them, even so much as my three Earthen Jars.
As to my Boat it was a very good one, and that he saw, and told
me he would buy it of me for the Ship's Use, and asked me what I
would have for it? I told him he 1 ad been so generous to me in
everything, that I could not offer to make any Price of the Boat, but
led it entirely to him, upon which he told me he would give me a
Note of his Hand to pay me 80 Pieces of Eight for it at Brasil, and
when it came there, if any one offer'd to give more he would make it
up; he offer'd me also 60 Pieces of Eight more for ray Boy Xury,
which I was loth to take, not that I was not willing to let the Cap-
tain have him, but I very loth to sell the poor Boy's Liberty, who
had assisted me so faithfully in procuring my own. However when
I let him know my Reason, he owned it to be just, and offer'd me
this Medium, that he would give the Boy an Obligation to set him
free in ten Years, if he turned Christian; upon this, and Xury saying
he was willing to go to him, I let the Captain have him.
We had a very good Voyage to the Brasils, and arriv'd in the Bay
de Todos los Santos, or All-Saints Bay, in about Twenty-two Days
after. And now I was once more deliver'd from the most miserable
of all Conditions of Life, and what to do next with myself I was now
to consider.
The generous Treatment the Captain gave me, I can never enough
remember; he would take nothing of me for my Passage, gave me
twenty Ducats for the Leopard's Skin, and forty for the Lion's Skin
which I had in my Boat, and caused everything I had in my Ship
to b^ punctually deliver'd me, and what I was willing to sell he
bought, such as the Case of Bottles, two of my Guns, and a Piece of
the Lump of Bees-wax, for I had made Candles of the rest; in a
word, I made about 220 Pieces of Eight of all my Cargo, and with this
Stock I went on Shore in the Brasils.
I had noc been long here, but being recommended to the House of
a good honest Man like himself, who had an Ingeino as they call it;
that is, a Plantation and a Sugar-House. I lived with him some time,
and acquainted myself by that means with the Manner of their
planting and making of Sugar; and seeing how well the Planters
lived, and how they grew rich suddenly, I resolv'd, if I could get
Licence to settle there, I wound turn Planter among them, resolving
in the meantime to find out some Way to get my Money which I
had left in London remitted to me. To this Purpose getting a kind
of a Letter of Naturalization, I purchased as much Land that was
Uncur'd, as my Money would reach, and formed a Plan for my Plan-
tation and Settlement, and such a one as might be suitable to the
Stock which I proposed to myself to receive from England.
I had a Neighbour, a Portuguese of Lisbon, but bor n of English
Parents, whose Name was Wells, and in much such Circumstances as
I was. I call him my Neighbour, because his Plantation lay next to
mine, and we went on very sociably together. My Stock was but low
as well as his; and we rather planted for Food, than anything else,
for about two Years. However, we began to increase, and our Land
began to come into Order; so that the third Year we planted
some Tobacco, and made each of us a large Piece of Ground ready
for planting Canes in the Year to come; but we both wanted Help,
and now I found more than before, I had done wrong in parting
with my Boy Xury.
But alas! for me to do wrong that never did right, was no great
Wonder; I had no Remedy but to go on; I was gotten into an em-
ployment quite remote to my Genius, and directly contrary to the
Life I delighted in, and for which I forsook my Father's House, and
broke through all his good Advice; nay, I was coming into the very
Middle Station, or upper Degree of low Life, which my Father ad-
vised me to before; and which if I resolved to go on with, I might
as well have stayed at Home, and never have fatigu'd myself in the
World as I had done; and I used often to say to myself, I could have
done this as well in England among my Friends, as have gone 5000
Miles off to do it among Strangers and Savages in a Wilderness,
and at such a Distance, as never to hear from any Part of the World
that had the least Knowledge of me.
In this manner I used to look upon my Condition with the utmost
Regret I had nobody to converse with but now and then this
Neighbour; no Work to be done, but by the Labour of my Hands;
and I used to say, I lived just like a Man cast away upon some desolate
Island, that had nobody there but himself. But how just has it been,
and how should all Men reflect, that when they compare their present
Conditions with others that are worse, Heaven may oblige them to
make the Exchange, and be convinc'd of their former Felicity by their
Experience: I say, how just has it been, that the truly solitary Cife
I reflected on in an Island of mere Desolation should be my Lot, who
had so often unjustly compar'd it with the Life which I then led, in
which had I continued, I had in all Probability been exceeding pros-
perous and rich.
I was in some Degree settled in my Measures for carrying on the
Plantation, before my kind Friend the Captain of the Ship that took
me up at Sea, went back; for the Ship remained there in providing
his Loading, and preparing for his Voyage, near three Months, when
telling him what little Stock I had left behind me in London, he gave
me this friendly and sincere Advice, Seignior Inglese, says he; for so he
always called me, if you will give me letters, and a Procuration heie
in Form to me, with Orders to the Person who has your Money in
London, to send your Effects to Lisbon, to such Persons as I shall
direct, and in such Goods as are proper for this Country, I will bring
you the Produce of them, God willing, at my Return; but sri.ce h jman
Affairs are all subject to Changes and Disasters, I would have you
give Orders but for One Hundred Pounds Sterl. which you say is Half
your Stock, and let the Hazard be run for the first; so that if it come
safe, you may order the rest the same Way; and if it miscarry, you
may have the other Half to have Recourse to for your Supply.
This was so wholesome Advice, and looked so friendly, that I could
not but be convinc'd it was the best Course I could take; so I ac-
cordingly prepared Letters to the Gentlewoman with whom I had
left my Money, and a Procuration to the Portuguese Captain, as he
desired.
I wrote the English Captain's Widow a full Account of all my Ad-
ventures, my Slavery, Escape, and how I had met with the Portugal
Captain at Sea, the Humanity of his Behaviour, and in what Condition
I was now in, with all other necessary Directions for my Supply; and
when this honest Captain came to Lisbon, he found means by some of
the English Merchants there, to send over not the Order only, but a
full Account of my Story to a Merchant at London, who represented
it effectually to her; whereupon, she not only delivered the Money,
but out of her own Pocket sent the Portugal Captain a very handsome
Present for his Humanity and Charity to me.
The Merchant in London vesting this Hundred Pounds in English
Goods, such as the Captain had writ for, sent them directly to him at
Lisbon, and he brought them all safe to me to the Brasils, among
which, without my Direction (for I was too young in my Business to
think of them) he had taken Care to have all Sorts of Tools, Iron-
Work, and Utensils necessary for my Plantation, and which were of
great Use to me.
When this Cargo arrived, I thought my Fortunes made, for I was
surprised with Joy of it; and my good Steward the Captain had laid
out the Five Pounds which my Friend had sent him for a Present for
himself, to purchase, and bring me over a Servant under Bond for six
Years' Service, and would not accept of any Consideration, except a
little Tobacco, which I would have him accept, being of my own
Produce.
Neither was this all; but my Goods being all English Manufactures,
such as Cloth, Stuffs, Bays, and things particularly valuable and de-
sirable in the Country, I found means to sell them to a very great
Advantage; so that I might say, I had more than four times the Value
of my first Cargo, and was now infinitely beyond my poor Neighbour,
I mean in the Advancement of my Plantation; for the first thing I
did, I bought me a Negro Slave, and an European Servant also; I
mean another besides that which the Captain brought me from Lisbon.
But as abus'd Prosperity is oftentimes made the very Means of our
greatest Adversity, so was it with me. I went on the next Year with
great Success in my Plantation: I raised fifty great Rolls of Tobacco
on my own Ground, more than I had disposed of for Necessaries
among my Neighbours; and these fifty Rolls being each of above a
: oo Wt. were well cured and laid by against the Return of the Fleet
from Lisbon: and now increasing in Business and in Wealth, my
Head began to be full of Projects and Undertakings beyond my Reach;
such as are indeed often the Ruin of the best Heads in Business.
Had I continued in the Station I was now in, I had room for all
the happy things to have yet befallen me, for which my Father so
earnestly recommended a quiet retired Life, and of which he had so
sensibly describ'd the middle Station of Life to be full of; but other
things attended me, and I was still to be the wilful Agent of all my
own Miseries; and particularly to increase my Fault and double the
Reflections upon myself, which in my future Sorrows I should have
leisure to make; all these Miscarriages were procured by my appa-
rent obstinate adhering to my foolish inclination of wandering abroad
and pursuing that Inclination, in contradiction to the clearest Views
of doing myself good in a fair and plain pursuit of those Prospects
and those measures of Life, which Nature and Providence concurred
to present me with, and to make my Duty.
As I had once done thus in my breaking away from my Parents, so
I could not be content now, but I must go and leave the happy View
I had of being a rich and thriving Man in my new Plantation, only to
pursue a rash and immoderate Desire of rising faster than the Nature
of the Thing admitted; and thus I cast myself down again into the
deepest Gulf of human Misery that ever Man fell into, or perhaps
could be consistent with Life and a State of Health in the World.
To come then by the just Degrees, to the Particulars of this Part
of my Story; you may suppose, that having now lived almost four
Years in the Brasilo, and beginning to thrive and prosper very well
upon my Plantation; I had not only learned the Language, but had
contracted Acquaintance and Friendship among my Fellow-Planters,
as well as among the Merchants at St Salvadore, which was our Port
and that in my Discourses among them, I had frequently given them
an Account of my two Voyages to the Coast of Guinea, the manner
of Trading with the Negroes there, and how easy it was to purchase
upon the Coast, for Trifles, such as Beads, Toys, Knives, Scissars,
Hatchets, bits of Glass, and the like; not only Gold Dust, Guinea
Grains, Elephants' Teeth, &c., but Negroes for the Service of the
Brasils, in great Numbers.
They listened always very attentively to my Discourses on these
Heads, but especially to that Part which related to the buying
Negroes, which was a Trade at that time not only not far entered
into, but as far as it was, had been carried on by the Assientoe, or
Permission of the Kings of Sfain and Portugal, and engross'd in
the Public, so that few Negroes were brought, and those excessive
dear.
It happen'd, being in Company with some Merchants and Planters
of my Acquaintance, and talking of those things very earnestly,
three of them came to me the next Morning, and told me they had
been musing very much upon what I had discoursed with them of,
the last Night, and they came to make a secret Proposal to me; and
after enjoining me Secrecy, they told me, that they had a mind to fit
out a Ship to go to Guinea, that they had all Plantations as well as I,
and were straiten'd for nothing so much as Servants; that as it was
a Trade that could not be carried on, because they could not pub-
licly sell the Negroes when they came home, so they desired to
make but one Voyage, to bring the Negroes on Shore privately, and
divide them among their own Plantations; and in a Word, the Ques-
tion was, whether I would go their Supercargo in the Ship to
manage the Trading Part upon the Coast of Guinea? And they
offer'd me that I should have my equal Share of the Negroes without
providing any Part of the Stock.
This was a fair Proposal it must be confess'd, had it been made
to any one that had not had a Settlement and Plantation of his own
to look after, which was in a fair way of coming to be very consider-
able, and with a good Stock upon it But for me that was thus
entered and established, and had nothing to do but go on as I had
begun for three or four Years more, and to have sent for the othei
hundred Pound from England, and who in that time, and with that
little Addition, could scarce have failed of being worth three or four
thousand Pounds Sterling, and that increasing too; for me to think
33
of such a Voyage, was the most preposterous Thing that ever Man in
such Circumstances could be guilty of.
But I that was born to be my own Destroyer, could no more resist
the Offer than I could restrain my first rambling Designs, when my
Father's good Counsel was lost upon me. In a word, I told them I
would go with all my Heart, if they would undertake to look after my
Plantation in my Absence, and would dispose of it to such as I should
direct if I miscarry'd. This they all engag'd to do, and entered into
Writings or Covenants to do so; and I made a formal Will, disposing
of my Plantation and Effects, in Case of my Death, making the Cap-
tain of the Ship that had saved my Life as before, my universal Heir,
but obliging him to dispose of my Effects as I had directed in my
Will, one half of the Produce being to himself, and the other to be
shipped to England.
In short, I took all possible Caution to preserve my Effects, and
keep up my Plantation; had I used half as much Prudence to have
looked into my own Interest, and have made a Judgment of what I
ought to have done, and not to have done, I had certainly never
gone away from so prosperous an Undertaking, leaving all the probable
Views of a thriving Circumstance, and gone upon a Voyage to Sea,
attended with all its common Hazards; to say nothing of the Reasons
I had to expect particular Misfortunes to myself.
But I was hurried on, and obey'd blindly the Dictates of my Fancy
rather than my Reason; and accordingly the Ship being fitted out,
and the Cargo furnished, and all things done as by Agreement, by
my Partners in the Voyage, I went on Board in an evil Hour, the
First of September 1659, being the same Day eight Year that I went
from my Father and Mother at Hull, in order to act the Rebel to
their Authority, and the Fool to my own Interest
Our Ship was about iao Ton Burthen, carried 6 Guns, and 14 Men,
besides the Master, his Boy, and myself; we had on board no large
Cargo of Goods, except of such Toys as were fit for our Trade
with the Negroes, such as Beads, bits of Glass, Shells, and odd Trifles,
especially little Looking-Glasses, Knives, Scissars, Hatchets, and the
like.
The same Day I went on board we set sail, standing away to the
Northward upon our own Coast, with Design to stretch over for the
African Coast, when they came about 10 or 12 Degrees of Norther*
Latitude, which it seems was the manner of their Course in those Days.
We had very good Weather, only excessive hot, all the way upon out
own Coast, till we came to the Height of Cape St Augustino, from
whence keeping farther off at Sea we lost Sight of Land, and steered
as if we were bound for the . Isle Fernand de 'Noronha, holding our
Course N.E. by N. and leaving those Isles on the East; in this
Course we passed the Line in about .12 Days'time, and were by our last
Observation in 7 Degrees 22 Min. Northern Latitude, when a violent
Tornado or Hurricane took us quite out of our Knowledge; it began
from the South-East, came about to the North-West, and then settled
into the North-East, from whence it blew in such a terrible manner,
that for j 2 Days together we could do nothing but drive, and scudding
away before it, let it carry us whither ever Fate and the Fury of the
Winds directed; and during these 12 Days', I need not say, that I
expected every Day to be swallowed up, nor indeed did any in the
Ship expect to save their Lives.
In this Distress, we had, besides the Terror of the Storm, one of
our Men died of the Calenture, and one Man and the Boy washed
overboard; about the 12th Day the Weather abating a little, the
Master made an Observation as well as he could, and found that he
was in about 11 Degrees North Latitude, but that he was 22 Degrees
of Longitude difference West from Cape St Augustino; so that he
found he was gotten upon the Coast of Guinea, or the North Part of
Brasil, beyond the River Amazones, toward that cf the River Oronoqut,
commonly called the Great River, and began to consult with me what
Course he should take, for the Ship was leaky and very much disabled,
and he was going directly back to the Coast of Brasil.
I was positively against that, and looking over Charts of the Sea-
Coast of America with him, we concluded there was no inhabited
Country for us to have recourse to, till we came within the Circle c!
foe Carribbe-Islaiids, and therefore resolved to stand away for Barba-
does, which by keeping off at Sea, to "avoid the Indraft of the Bay or
Gulf of Mexico, we might easily perform, as we hoped, in about fif-
teen Days' Sail; whereas we could not possibly make our Voyage to
the Coast of Africa without some Assistance, both to our Ship and
to ourselves.
With this Design we changed our Course and steered away N. IV.
by W. in order to reach some of our English Islands, where I hoped
for Relief; but our Voyage was otherwise determined, for being in
the Latitude of 12 Deg. 18 Min. a second Storm came upon us, which
earned us away with the same Impetuosity Westward, and drove us so
out of the very Way of all human Commerce, that had all our Lives
been saved, as to the Sea, we were rather in Danger of being de
voured by Savages than ever returning to our own Country.
In this Distress, the Wind still blowing very hard, one of our Men
early in the Morning, cried out, Land; and we had no sooner run
out of the Cabin to look out in hopes of seeing whereabouts in
the World we were; but the Ship struck upon a Sand, and in a
moment her Motion being so stopped, the Sea broke over her in
such a manner, that we expected we should all have perish'd imine-
-Siately, and we were immediately driven into our close Quarters to
shelter us from the very Foam and Spray of the Sea.
It is not easy for any one, who has not been in the like Condition,
to describe or conceive the Consternation of Men in such Circum-
stances; we knew nothing where we were, or upon what Land it was
we were driven, whether an Island or the Main, whether inhabited
or not inhabited; and as the Rage of tne Wind was still great,
though rather less than at first, we could not so much as hope to have
the Ship hold many Minutes without breaking in Pieces, unless the
Winds by a kind of Miracle should turn immediately about In a
word, w; sat looking one upon another, and expecting Death every
Moment, and every Man acting accordingly, as preparing for another
World, for there was little or nothing more for us to do in this;
that which was our present Comfort, and all the Comfort we had,
was, that contrary to our Expectation the Ship did not break yet,
and that the Master said U12 Wind began to abate.
Now though we thought that the Wind did a little abate, yet the Ship
having thus struck upon the Sand, and sticking too fast for us to ex-
pect her getting off, we were in a dreadful Condition indeed, and
had nothing to do but to think of saving our Lives as well as we
could; we had a Boat at our Stern just before the Storm, but she
was first staved by dashing against the Ship's Rudder, and in the
next Place she broke away, and either sunk or was driven off to
Sea, so there was no hope from her; we had another Boat on board,
but how to get her off into the Sea, was a doubtful thing; however,
there was no room to debate, for we fancied the Ship would break
in Pieces every Minute, and some told us she was actually broken
already.
In this Distress, the Mate of our Vessel lays hold of the Boat, and
with the help of the rest of the Men, they got her slung over the
Ship's side, and getting all into her, let go, and committed ourselves
being Eleven in Number, to God's Mercy, and the wild Sea; for though
the Storm was abated considerably, yet the Sea went dreadful high
npon the Shore, and might well be called, Den wild Zee, as the Dutch
call the Sea in a Storm.
And now our Case was very dismal indeed; for we all saw plainly
that the Sea went so high, that the Boat could not live, and that we
should be inevitably drowned. As to making Sail, we had none, nor,
if we had, could we have done anything with it; so we worked at the
Oar towards the Land, though with heavy Hearts, like Men going to
Execution; for we all knew, that when the Boat came nearer the
Shore, she would be dashed in a Thousand Pieces by the Breach of
the Sea. However, we committed our Souls to God in the most
earnest Manner, and the Wind driving us towards the Shore, we
hasten'd our Destruction with our own Hands, pulling as well as we
could towards Land.
What the Shore was, whether Rock or Sand, whether Steep or
Shoal, we knew not; the only Hope that could rationally give us the
least Shadow of Expectation, was, if we might happen into some Bay
or Gulf, or the Mouth of some River, where by great Chance we
might have run our Boat in, or got under the Lee of the Land, and
perhaps made smooth Water. But there was nothing of this appeared;
but as we made nearer and nearer the Shore, the Land looked more
frightful than the Sea.
After we had rowed, or rather driven about a League and a Half,-
as we reckon'd it, a raging Wave, Mountain-like, came rolling a-ster
n
of us, and plainly bade us expect the Coup-de-Grace. In a word, it
took us with such a Fury, that it overset the Boat at once; and sepa-
rating us as well from the Boat, as from one another, gave us not
time hardly to say, O God 1 for we were all swallowed up in a Mo
ment
Nothing can describe the Confusion of Thought which I felt when
1 sunk into the Water; for though I swam very well, yet I could not
deliver myself from the Waves so as to draw Breath, till that Wavy
having driven me, or rather carried me a vast Way on towards the
Shore, and having spent itself, went back, and left me upon the
Land almost dry, but half dead with the Water I took in. I had so
tuch Presence of Mind as well as Breath left, that seeing myself
EOBINSON CRISOE SMI WEECK!7!!.— T. 36.
nearer the main Land than I expected, I got upon my Feet, and en-
deavoured to make on towards the Land as fast as I could, before
another Wave should return, and take me up again. But I soon
found it was impossible to avoid it; for I saw the Sea come after me
as high as a great Hill, and as furious as an Enemy which I had no
Means or Strength to contend with; my Business was to hold my
Breath, and raise myself upon the Water, if I could; and so by
swimming to preserve my Breathing, and Pilot myself towards the
Shore, if possible; my greatest Concern now being, that the Sea, as
it would carry me a great Way towards the Shore when it came on,
might not carry me back again with it when it gave back towards the
Sea.
The Wave that came upon me again, buried me at once 20 or 30

Foot deep in its own Body; and I could feel myself carried with s
mighty Force and Swiftness towards the Shore a very great Way; but
I held my Breath, and assisted myself to swim still forward with all
my Might I was ready to burst with holding my Breath, when, as I
elt myself rising up, so to my immediate Relief, I found my Head
nd Hands shoot out above the Surface of the Waiei; and though it
was not two Seconds of Time that I could keep myself so, yet it
reliev'd me greatly, gave me Breath and new Courage. I was covered
again with Water a good while, but not so long but I held it out; and
finding the Water had spent itself, and began to return, I struck for-
ward against the Return of the Waves, and felt Ground again with
my Feet I stood still a few Moments to recover Breath, and till the
Water went from me, and then took to my Heels, and run with what
ADVENTURES OF
StrengtL i had farther towards the Shore. But neither would this
deliver me from the Fury of the Sea, which came pouring in after me
again, and twice more I was lifted up by the Waves, and carried for-
wards as before, the Shore being very flat
The last Time of these two had well near been fatal to me; for the
Sea having hurried me along as before, landed me, or rather dashed
me against a Piece of a Rock, and that with such Force, as it left me
senseless, and indeed helpless, as to my own Deliverance; for the
Blow taking my Side and Breast, beat the Breath as it were quite out
of my Body; and had it returned again immediately, I must have been
strangled in the Water; but I recover'd a little before the return of
the Waves, and seeing I should be cover'd again with the Water, I
resolv'd to hold fast by a Piece of the Rock, and so to hold my
Breath, if possible, till the Wave weut back; now as the Waves were
not so high as at first,
being nearer Land, I
held my Hold till the
Wave abated, and
then fetched another
Run, which brought
me so near the Shore,
that the next Wave,
though it went over
me, yet did not so
swallow me up as to
carry me away, and
the next run I took, I
got to the main Land,
yhere, to my great Comfort, I clamber'd up the Cliffs of the Shore,
and sat me down upon the Grass, free from Danger, and quite out of
the Reach of the Water.
I was now landed, and safe on Shore, and began to look up and
thank God that my Life was saved in a Case wherein there was some
Minutes before scarce any room to hope. I believe it is impossible
to express to the Life what the Ecstasies and Transports of the Sou'
are, when it is so saved, as I may say, out of the very Grave; and 1
do not wonder now at that Custom, viz. That when a Malefactor, who
has the Halter about his Neck, is tied up, and just going to be turned
off. and has a Reprieve brought to him: I say, I do not wonder that

they bring a Surgeon with it, to let him Blood that very Moment
they tell him of it, that the Surprise may not drive the Animal Spirits
from the Heart, and overwhelm him: I
For sudden Joys, like Griefs, confound at first. '.
I walked about on the Shore, lifting up my Hands, and my whole
Being, as I may say, wrapt up in the Contemplation of my Deliverance,
making a Thousand Gestures and Motions which I cannot describe,
reflecting upon all my Comrades that were drowned, and that there
should not be one Soul saved but myself; for, as for them, I never
saw them afterwards, or any Sign of them, except three of their Hats,
one Cap, and two Shoes that were not Fellows.
I cast my Eyes to the stranded Vessel, when the Breach and Froth
of the Sea being so big, I could hardly see it, it lay so far oft", and
considered, Lord! how was it possible I could get on Shore?
After I had solac'd my Mind with the comfortable Part of my Con-
dition, I began to look round me to see what kind of Place I was in,
and what was next to be done, and I soon found my Comforts abate,
and that in a word I had a dreadful Deliverance: For I was wet,
had no Clothes to shift me, nor anything either to eat or drink to
comfort me, neither did I see any Prospect before me, but that of
perishing with Hunger, or being devour'd by wild Beasts; and that
which was particularly afflicting to me, was, that I had no Weapon
either to hunt and kill any Creature for my Sustenance, or to defend
myself against any other Creature that might desire to kill me for
theirs: In a Word, I had nothing about me but a Knife, a Tobacco-
pipe, and a little Tobacco in a Box, this was all my Provision, and
this threw me into terrible Agonies of Mind, that for a while I ran
about like a Madman; Night coming upon me, I began with a heavy
Heart to consider what would be my Lot if there were any ravenous
Beasts in that Country, seeing at Night they always come abroad for
their Prey.
All the Remedy that ofter'd to my Thoughts at that Time, was, to
get up into a thick bushy Tree like a Fir, but thorny, which grew
near me, and where I resolv'd to sit all Night, and consider the next
Day what Death I should die, for as yet I saw no Prospect of life;
I walked about a Furlong from the Shore, to see if I could find any
fresh Water to drink, which I did, to my great Joy; and having
drank and put a little Tobacco in my Mouth to prevent Hunger, I
went to the Tree, and getting up into it, endeavour'd to place myself
ADVENTURES Ob
so, as that if I should sleep I might not fall; and having cui me a
short Stick, like a Truncheon, for my Defence, I took up my Lodging,
and having been excessively fatigu'd, I fell fast asleep, and slept as
comfortably as, I believe, few could have done in my Condition, and
found myself the most refresh'd with it, that I think I ever was on
such an Occasion.
When I waked it was broad Day, the Weather clear, and the Storm
abated, so that the Sea did not rage and swell as before: But that
which surpris'd me most, was, that the Ship was lifted offin the Nigh*
from the Sand where she lay, by the Swelling of Tide, and was
driven up almost as far as the Rock which I first mention'd, where I
r a i been so bruised by the dashing me against it; this being within
about a Mile from the Shore
where I was, and the Ship seem-
ing to stand upright still, I wished
myself on board, that, at least,
I might have some necessary
things for my use.
When I came down from my
Apartment in the Tree, I looked
about me again, and the first
thing I found was the Boat,
which lay as the Wind and the
Sea had tossed her up upon the
Land, about two Miles on my
right Hand, I walked as far as
I could upon the Shore to have got to her, but found a Neck or
Inlet of Water '.between me and the Boat, which was about half a
Mile broad, so I came back for the present, being more intent upon
getting at the Ship, where I hoped to find something for my present
Subsistence.
A little after Noon I found the Sea very calm, and the Tide ebbed
so far out, that I could come within a Quarter of a Mile of the Ship;
and here I found a fresh renewing of my Grief, for I saw evidently,
that if we had kept on board, we had all been safe, that is to say,
we had all got safe on Shore, and I had not been so miserable
as to be left -entirely destitute of all Comfort and Company, as I
now was; this forced Tears from my Eyes again, but as there
was little Relief in that; I resolv'd, if possible, to get to the Ship, so

I pulled off my Clothes, for the Weather was hot to the Extremity,
and took the Water, but when I came to the Ship, my Difficulty was
*till greater to know how to get on board, for as she lay a-ground,
and high out of the Water, there was nothing within my Reach to lay
.X)ld of, I swam round her twice, and the second Time I spied a
small Piece of a Rope, which I wonder'd I did not see at first, hang
down by the Fore-Chains so low, as that with great Difficulty I got
hold of it, and by the help of that Rope, got up into the Forecastle
of the Ship, here I found that the Ship was bulged, and had a great
deal of Water in her Wold, but that she lay so on the Side of a
Bank of hard Sf.^d, or rather Earth, that her Ster n lay lifted up upon
the Bank, and her Head low almost to the Water; by this Means all
her Quarter was free, and all that was in that Part was dry; for you
may be sure my first Work was to search and to see what was spoiled
and what was free; and first I found that all the Ship's Provisions
were dry and untouch'd by the Water,and being very well dispos'd to eat,
I went to the Bread-room and filled my Pockets with Biscuit, and eat
k as I went about other things, for I had no time to lose; I also
found some Rum in the great Cabin, of which I took a large
Dram, and which I had indeed need enough of to spirit me for
what was before me: Now I wanted nothing but a Boat to furnish
myself with many things which I foresaw would be very necessary
to me.
It was in vain to sit still and wish for what was not to be had, and
this Extremity roused my Application; we had several spare Yards,
and two or three large spars of Wood, and a spare Topmast or two
in the Ship; I resolv'd to fall to work with these, and flung as many
of them overboard as I could manage for their Weight, tying every
one with a Rope that they might not drive away; when this was
done I went down the Ship's Side, and pulling them to me, I tied
four of them fast together at both Ends as well as I could, in the
Form of a Raft, and laying two or three short Pieces of Plank upon
them crossways, I found I could walk upon it very well, but that it
was not able to bear any great Weight, the Pieces being too light; sc
I went to work, and with the Carpenter's Saw I cut a spare Topmas*
into three Lengths, and added them to my Raft, with a great deal oi
Labour and Pains, but hope of furnishing myself with Necessaries,
encourag'd me to go beyond what I should have been able to have
done upon another Occasion.
ADVENTURES OF
My Raft was now strong enough to bear any reasonable Weight;
my next Care was what to load it with, and how to preserve what I
laid upon it from the Surf of the Sea; But I was not long considering
this, I first laid all the Plank or Boards upon it that I could get, and
having consider'd well what I most wanted, I first got three of the
Seamen's Chests, which I had broken open and empty'd, and lower'd
them down upon my Raft; the first of these I filled with Provisions,
viz. Bread, Rice, three Dutch Cheeses, five Pieces of dried Goat's
Flesh, which we lived much upon, and a little Remainder of European
Corn which had been laid by for some Fowls which we brought to

Sea with us, but the Fowls were killed, there had been some Barley
and Wheat together, but, to my great disappointment, I found after-
wards that the Rats had eaten or spoiled it all; as for Liquors I
found severd Cases of Bottles belonging to our Skipper, £ which
were some Cord.al Water,, and in all about five or Z Gallons of
tt™' t*% r^Sl°Wed bythemselves> there being no need to pu,
hem into the Chest, nor no room for them. While I was doing this.
found AeT.de began to flow, though very calm, and I had the Mo£
ficafon to see my Coat, Shirt, and Waistcoat, which I had left oo
Shore upon the Sand, swim away; as for mv Breeches which%£
43
only Linen and open-kneed, I swam on board in them and my
Stockings: However this put me upon rummaging for Clothes, oi
which I found enough, but took no more than I wanted for present
use, for I had other things which my Eye was more upon, as first
Tools to work with on Shore, and it was after long searching that 1
found out the Carpenter's Chest, which was indeed a vrry useful
Prize to me, and much more valuable tr.:.n a Ship Loading of Gold
would have been at that
time; I got it down to
my Raft, even whole as
it was, without losii„
time to look into it, for
I knew in general what
it contain'd.
My next Care was for
some Ammunition, and
Arms; there were twe
very good Fowling-pieces
in the great Cabin, and
two Pistols, thece I se-
cur'd first, with some
Powder-horns, and a
small Bag of Shot, and
two old rusty Swords: I
knew there were three
Barrels of Powder in the
Ship, but knew not where
our Gunner had stowed
them, but with m1''
search I found them,
two of them dry and
good, the third had taken Water, those two I got to my Raft, with
the Arms, and now I thought myself pretty well freighted, and began
to think how I should get to Shore with them, having neither Sail.
Oar, or Rudder, and the least Capfull of Wind would have overse\
9JI my Navigation.
I had three Encouragements, 1. A smooth calm Sea, a. The Tide
rising and setting in to the Shore, 3. What little Wind there was
blew me towards the Land; and thus, having found *wo or three

ADVENTURES OB
broken Oars belonging to the Boat, and besides the Tools which were
in the Chest, I found two Saws, an Axe, and a Hammer, and
with this Cargo I put to Sea: For a Mile, or thereabouts, my Raft
went very well, only that I found it drive a little distant from the
Place where I had landed before, by which I perceiv'd that there was
some Indraft of the Water, and consequently I hoped to find some
Creek or River there, which I might make use of as a Port to get to
Land with my Cargo.
As I imagin'd, so it was, there appear'd befoie me a little opening
rf the Land, and I found a strong Current of the Tide set into it, so

I guided my Raft as well as I could to keep in the Middle of the
Stream: But here I had like to have suffer'd a second Shipwreck,
which, if I had, I think verily would have broke my Heart, for know,
ing nothing of the Coast, my Raft run a-ground at one end of it upon
a Shoal, and not being a-ground at the other End, it wanted but a
little that all my Cargo had slipped off towards that End that was
afloat, and so fallen into the Water: I did my utmost by setting my
Back against the Chests, to keep them in their Places, but could not
thrust off the Raft with all my Strength, neither durst I stir from the
Posture I was in, but holding up the Chests with all my Might, stood
in that Manner near half an Hour, in which time the rising of the
Water brought me a little more upon a Level, and a little after, the
Water still rising, my Raft floated again, and I thrust her off with the
Oar I had, into the Channel, and then driving up higher, I at length
found myself in the Mouth of a little River, with Land on both Sides,
and a strong Current or Tide running up, I looked on both Sides for
a proper Place to get to Shore, for I was not willing to be driven too
high up the River, hoping in time to see some Ship at Sea, and there-
fore resolv'd to place myself as near the Coast as I could.
At length I spied a little Cove on the right Shore of the Creek, to
which with great Pain and Difficulty I guided my Raft, and at last
got so near, as that, reaching Ground with my Oar, I could thrust her
directly in, but here I had like to have dipped all my Cargo in the Sea
again; for that Shore lying pretty steep, that is to say sloping, there
was no Place to land, but where one End of my Float, if it run on
Shore, would lie so high, and the other sink lower as before, that it
would endanger my Cargo again: All that I could do, was to wait till
the Tide was at highest, keeping the Faft with my Oar like an
Anchor to hold the Side of it fast to the Shore, near a flat Piece of
Ground, which I expected the Water would flow over; andVso it did:
As soon as I found Water enough, for my Raft drew about a Foot of
Water, I thrust her on upon that flat Piece of Ground, and there
fast-m'd or moored her by sticking my two broken Oars into the Ground;
one on one Side near one End, and one on the other Side near the
other End; and thus I lay till the Water ebbed away, and left my
P.aft and all my Cargo safe on Shore.
My next Work was to view the Country, and seek a proper Place
for my Habitation, and where to stow my Goods to secure them from
whatever might happen; where I was I yet knew not, whether on the
Continent or on an Island, whether inhabited or not inhabited, whe-
ther in Danger of wild Beasts or not: There was a Hill not above a
Mile from me, which rose up very steep and high, and which seemed
to over-top some other Hills which lay as in a Ridge from it north-
ward; I took out one of the fowling Pieces, and one of the Pistols,
and an Horn of Powder, and thus armed I travell'd for Discovery up
to the Top of that Hill, where after I had with great Labour and
Difficulty got to the Top, I saw my Fate to my great Affliction, (viz.)
tfiat I was in an Island environ'd every Way with the Sea, no Land
ADVENTURES OF
to be seen, except some Rocks which lay a great Way off, and two small
Islands less than this, which lay about three Leagues to the West
I found also that the Island I was in was barren, and, as I saw
good Reason to believe, uninhabited, except by wild Beasts, of whom
however I saw none, yet I saw Abundance of Fowls, but knew not
their Kinds, neither when I killed
them could I tell what was fit for
Food, and what not; at my coming
back, I shot at a great Bird which
I saw sitting upon a Tree on the
Side of a great Wood, I believe it
was the first Gun that had been
fired there since the Creation of the
World; I had no sooner fired, but
from all the Parts of the Wood
there arose an innumerable Number
of Fowls of many Sorts, making a
confus'd Screaming, and crying
every one according to his usual
Note; but not one of them of any
Kind that I knew: As for the
Creature I killed, I took it to be a
Kind of a Hawk, its Colour and
Beak resembling it, but had no
Talons or Claws more than com-
mon, its Flesh was Carrion, and fit
for nothing.
Contented with this Discovery,
I came back to my Raft, and fell
to Work to bring my Cargo on Shore, which took me up the rest of
that Day, and what to do with myself at Night I knew not, nor indeed
whero to rest; for I was afraid to lie down on the Ground, not know-
ing but some wild Beast might devour me, though as I afterwards found,
there was really no Need for those Fears.
However, as well as I could, I barncado'd myself round with the
Chests and Boards that I had brought on Shore, and made a Kind of
a Hut for that Night's Lodging; as for Food, I yet saw not which
Way to supply myself, except I had seen two or three Creatures like
Hares run out of the Wood where I shot the FowL

1 now began to consider, that I might yet get a great many Things
cut of the Ship, which would be useful to me, and particularly some of
the Rigging, and Sails, and such other Things as might come to Lind,
and I resolv'd to make another Voyage on Board the Vessel, if pos-
sible; and as I knew that the first Storm that blew must necessarily
break her all in Pieces, I resolv'd to set all other Things apart, until I
got everything out of the Ship that I could get; then I called a
Council, that is to say, in my Thoughts, whether I should take back
the Raft, but this appear'd impracticable; so I resolv'd to go as before,
when the Tide was down, and I did so, only that I stripped before I
went from my Hut, having nothing on but a Chequer'd Shirt and a
Pair of Linen Drawers, and a Pair of Pumps on my Feet

I got on Board the Ship, as before, and prepar'd a second Raft, and
having had Experience of the first, I neither made this so unwieldy,
nor loaded it so hard, but yet I brought away several Things very
useful to me; as first, in the Carpenter's Stores I found two or three
Bags full of Nails and Spikes, a great Screw-Jack, a Dozen or two of
Hatchets, and above all, that most useful Thing called a Grindstone;
all these I secured together, with several Things belonging to the
Gunner, particularly two or three Iron Crows, and two Barrels of
Musket-Bullets, seven Muskets, and another fowling Piece, with
iome small Quantity of Powder more; a large Bag full of small
Shot, and a great Roll of Sheet Lead: But this Last was so '. .avy, I
could not hoist it up to get it over the Ship's Side.
Besides these Things, I took all the Men's Clothes that I could
find, and a spare Fore-topsail, a Hammock, and some Bedding; and
with this I loaded my second Raft, and brought them all safe on
Shore to my very great Comfort
I was under some Apprehensions during my Absence from the
Land, that at least my Provisions might be devour'd on Shore; but
when I came back, I found no Sign of any Visitor, only there sat a
Creature like a wild Cat upon one of the Chests, which when I came
towards it, ran away a little Distance, and then stood still; she sat
rery compos'd, and unconcern'd, and looked full in my Face, as if she
had a Mind to be acquainted with me, I presented my Gun at her,
but as she did not understand it, she was perfectly unconcern'd at it,
nor did she offer to stir away; upon which I tossed her a Bit of Biscuit,
though by the Way I was not very free of it, for my Store was not great:
However, I spared her a Bit, I say, and she went to it, smelled of it,
and ate it, and looked (as pleased) for more, but I thanked her, and
could spare no more; so she marched off.
Having got my second Cargo on Shore, though I was fain to open
the Barrels of Powder, and bring them by Parcels, for they were
too heavy, being large Casks, I went to work to make me a little
Tent with the Sail and some Poles which I cut for that Purpose, and
into this Tent I brought everything that I knew would spoil, either
with Rain or Sun, and I piled all the empty Chests and Casks up in
a Circle round the Tent, to fortify it from any sudden Attempt, either
from Man or Beast
When I had done this I blocked up the Door of the Tent with some
Boards within, and an empty Chest set up or End without, and spread-
ing one of the Beds upon the Ground, laying my two Pistols just at
my Head, and my Gun at Length by me, I went to Bed for the first
Time, and slept very quietly all Night, for I was very weary and
heavy, for the Night before I had slept little, and had labour'd
very hard all Day, as well to fetch all those Things from the Ship, as
to get them on Shore.
I had the biggest Magazine of all Kinds now that ever were laid
up, I believe, for one Man, but I was not satisfy'd still; for while
the Ship sat upright in that Posture, I thought I ought to get every-
thing out of her that I could; so every Day at low Water I went on
Board, and brought away something or other: But particularly the
third Time I went, I brought away as much of the Rigging as I could,
as also all the small Ropes and Rope-twine I could get, with a Piece
49
of spare Canvas, which was to mend the Sails upon Occasion, the
Barrel of wet Gunpowder: In a Word, I brought away all the Sails
ftrst and last, only that I was fain to cut them in Pieces, and bring as
much at a Time as I could; for they were no more useful to be Sails,
but as mere Canvas only.
But that which comforted me more still, was, that at tast of all,
after I had made five or six such Voyages as these, and thought I baif
nothing more to expect from the Ship that was worth ray meddling with,
I say, after all this, I found a great Hogshead of Bread, and three
large Runlets of Rum or Spirits, and a Box of Sugar, and a Barrel

of fine Flour; this was surprising to rr.e, because I had given over
expecting any more Provisions, except what was spoiled by the Water:
I soon empty'd the Hogshead of that Bread, and wrapt it up Parcel
by Parcel in Pieces of the Sails, which I cut out; and in a Word, I
get all this safe on Shore also.
The next Day I made another Voyage; and now having plunder'd
the Ship of what was portable and fit to hand out, I began with the
Cables; and cutting the great Cable into Pieces, such as I could
move, I got two Cables and a Hawser on Shore, with all the Iron-
work I could get; and having cut down the Spritsail-yard, and the
Missen-yard, and everything I could to make a large Raft, I loaded
it with all those heavy Goods, and came away: But my good Luck
began now to leave me; for this Raft was so unwieldy, and so over-
laden, that after I was entePd the little Cove, where I had landed the
rest of my Goods, not being able to guide it so handily as I did the
other, it overset, and threw me and all my Cargo into the Water;
as for myself it was no great Harm, for I was near the Shore;
but as to my Cargo, it was great Part of it lost, especially the Iron,
which I expected would have been of great Use to me: However,
when the Tide was out, I got most of the Pieces of Cable ashore, and
some of the Iron, though with infinite Labour; for I was fain to dip for
it into the Water, a Work which fatigu'd me very much: After this I
went every Day on Board, and brought away what I could get
I had been now Thirteen Days on Shore, and had been eleven
Times on Board the Ship; in which Time I had brought away alJ
that one Pair of Hands could well be suppos'd capable to bring, though
I believe verily, had the calm Weather held, I should have brought
away the whole Ship Piece by Piece: But preparing the 12 th Time
to go on Board, I found the Wind begin to rise; however at low
Waterl wenton Board,and though I thought I hadrummag'd the Cabin
so effectually, as that nothing more could be found, yet I discover'd a
Locker with Drapers in it, in one of which I found two or three
Razors, and one Pair of large Scissars, with some ten or a dozen of
good Knives and Forks; in another I found about Thirty six-Pounds
value in Money, some European Coin, some Brasil, some Pieces of
Eight, some Gold, some Silver.
I smiled to myself at the Sight of this Money, O Drug! said I
aloud, what art thou good for, Thou art not worth to me, no not the
taking off of the Ground, one of those Knives is worth all this Heap,
I have no Manner of use for thee, e'en remain where thou art, and
go tc the Bottom as a Creature whose Life is not worth saving. How
ever upon Second Thoughts, I took it away, and wrapping all this in
a Piece of Canvas, I began to think of making another Raft, but whUe
I was preparing this, I found the Sky overcast, and the Wind began
to rise, and in a Quarter of an Hour it blew a fresh Gale from the
Shore; it presently occur'd to me, that it was in vain to pretend to
make a Raft with the Wind off Shore, and that it was my Business to
be gone before the Tide of Flood began, otherwise I might not be
able to reach the Shore at all: Accordingly I let myself down into
Urn Water, and swam cross the Channel, which lay between the Ship
and the Sands, and even that with Difficulty enough, partly with the
Weight of the Things I had about me, and partly the Roughness of
the Water, for the Wind rose very hastily, and before it was quite high
Water, it blew a Storm.
But I was gotten home to my little Tent, where I lay with all my
Wealth about me very secure. It blew very hard all that Night, and in
the Morning when I looked out, behold no more Ship was to be seen;
I was a little surpriz'd, but recover'd myself with this satisfactory Re-
flection, vie. That I had lost no time, nor abated no Diligence to get
everything out of her that could be useful to me, and that indeed there
was little left in her that I was able to bring away if I had had more time.
I now gave over any more Thoughts of the Ship, or of anything
out of her, except what might drive on Shore from her Wreck, as
indeed divers Pieces of her afterwards did; but those things were of
small use to me.
My Thoughts were now wholly employ'd about securing myself
against either Savages, if any should appear, or wild Beasts, if any
were in the Island; and I had many Thoughts of the Method how to
do this, and what kind of Dwelling to make, whether I snould make
me a Cave in the Earth, or a Tent upon the Earth: And, in short,
I resolv'd upon both, the Manner and Description of which, it may
not be improper to give an Account of.
I soon found the Place I was in was not for my Settlement, parti-
cularly because it was upon a low moorish Ground near the Sea, and
I believ'd would not be wholesome, and more particularly because
there was no fresh Water near it, so I resolv'd to find a more healthy
and more convenient Spot of Ground.
/ I consulted several Things in my Situation which I found would
be proper for me. ist, Health, and fresh Water I just now mentioned,
adly, Shelter from the Heat of the Sun. 3dly, Security from ravenous
Creatures, whether Men or Beasts. 4thly, a View to the Sea, that if
God sent any Ship in Sight, I might not lose any Advantage for my
Deliverance, of which I was not willing to banish all my Expectation yet
In search of a Place proper for this, I found a little Plain on the
side of a rising Hill, whose Front towards this little Plain, was steep
as a House-side, so that nothing could come down upon me from the
Top; on the Side of this Rock there was a hollow Place worn a little
way in like the Entrance or Door of a Cave, but there was not really
any Cave or Way into the Rock at all. f
On the Flat of the Green, just before this hollow Place, I resolvd
to pitch my Tent; This Plain was not above an Hundred Yards broad
and about twice as long, and lay like a Green before my Door, and a1
the End of it descended irregularly every Way down into the Low-
grounds by the Sea-side. It was on the JV.M W. Side of the Hill,
so that I was shelter'd from the Heat every Day, till it came to a W.
and by S. Sun, or thereabouts, which in those Countries is near the
Setting.
Before I set up my Tent, I drew a half Circle before the hollow
Place, which took in about Ten Yards in its Semi-diameter from the
Rock, and Twenty Yards in its Diameter, from its Beginning and
Ending.
In this half Circle I pitched two Rows of strong Stakes, driving
them into the Ground till they stood very firm like Piles, the biggest
End being out of the Ground about Five Foot and a Half, and
sharpen'd on the Top: The two Rows did not stand above Six
Inches from one another.
Then I took the Pieces of Cable which I had cut in the Ship, and
I laid them in Rows one upon another, within the Circle, between
these two Rows of Stakes, up to the Top, placing other Stakes in the
Inside, leaning against them, about two Foot and a half high, like a
Spur to a Post, and this Fence was so strong, that neither Man or
Beast could gee into it or over it: This cost me a great deal of Time
and Labour, especially to cut the Piles in the Woods, bring them to
the Place, and drive them into the Earth.
The Entrance into this Place I made to be not by a Door, but
by a short Ladder to go over the Top, which Ladder, when I was in,
I lifted over after me, and so I was completely fenced in, and forti-
fied, as I thought, from all the World, and consequently slept secure
in the Night, which otherwise I could not have done, though as it ap-
pear'd afterward, there was no need of all this Caution from the Ene-
mies that I apprehended Danger from.
Into this Fence or Fortress, with infinite Labour, I carried all my
Riches, all my Provisions, Ammunition and Stores, of which you
have the Account above, and I made me a large Tent, which, to pre-
serve me from the Rains that in one Part of the Year are very vio-
lent there, I made double, viz. One smaller Tent within, and ona
larger Tent above it, and cover'd the uppermost with a large Tarpau-
lin which I had saved among the Sails.
^nd now I lay no more for a while in the Bed which I had brought
on Shore, but in a Hammock, which was indeed a very good one, and
belong^ to the Mate of the Ship.
Into this Tent I brought all my Provisions, and everything that
would spoil by the Wet, and having thus enclos'd all my Goods, I
made up the Entrance, which till now I had left open, and so passed
and repass'd, as I said, by a short Ladder.
When I had done this, I began to work my Way into the Rock,
and bringing all the Earth and Stones that I dug down out through my
Tent, I laid them up within my Fence in the Nature of a Terrace, tha.
so it raised the Ground within about a Foot and a Half; and thus I
made me a. Cave just behind my Tent, which served me like a Cellar
to my House.
It cost me much Labour, and many Days, before all these Things
were brought to Perfection, and therefore I must go back to some
other things which took up some of my Thoughts. At the same
time it happen'd after I had laid my Scheme for the setting up my
Tent, and making the Cave, that a Storm of Rain falling from a thick
dark Cloud, a sudden Flash of Lightning happen'd, and after
that a great Clap of Thunder, as is naturally the Effect of it; I was
not so much surpris'd with the Lightning as I was with a Thought
which darted into my Mind as swift as the Lightning itself: O my
Powder! My very Heart sunk within me, when I thought, that at
one Blast all my Powder might be destroyed, on which, not my de-
fence only, but the providing me Food, as I thought, entirely
depended; I was nothing near so anxious about my own Danger,
though had the Powder took fire, I had never known who had hurt
me.
Such Impression did this make upon me, that after the Storm was
over, I laid aside all my Works, my Building, and Fortifying, and
applied myself to make Bags and Boxes to separate the Powder, and
keep it a little and a little in a Parcel, in hope, that whatever might
come, it might not all take Fire at once, and to keep it so apart that
it should not be possible to make one part fire another: I finish'd
this Work in about a Fortnight, and I think my Powder, which in all
was about 240 lb. weight was divided in not less than a Hundred
Parcels ; as to the Barrel that had been wet, I did not apprehend any
Danger from that, so I placed it in my new Cave, which in my Fancy
I called my Kitchen, and the re?t I hid up and down in Holes among
ADVENTURES OF
the Rocks, so that no wet might come to it, marking very carefull*
where I laid it
In the Interval of time while this was doing I went out once at
least every Day with my Gun, as well to divert myself, as to see if I
could kill anything fit for Food, and as near as I could to acquaint
myself with what the Island produc'd. The first time I went out I
presently discovert that there were Goats in the Island, which was
a great Satisfaction to me; but then it was attended with this
Misfortune to me, viz. That they were so shy, so subtile, and so
swift of Foot, that it was the difficultest thing in the World to
come at them: But I was not discourag'd at this, not doubting
but I might now and then shoot one, as it soon happen'd, for
after I had found
their Haunts a little,
I laid wait in this
Manner for them: I
obseiVd if they saw
me in the Valleys,
though they were upon
the Rocks, they would
run away as in a ter-
rible Fright; but if
they were feeding in
the Valleys, and I was
upon the Rocks, thej
took no Notice of me,
from whence I concluded, that by the Position of their Optics, their
Sight was so directed downward, that they did not readily see Objects
that were above them; so afterward I took this Method, I always climbed
the Rocks first to get above them, and then had frequently a fait
Mark. The first shot I made among these Creatures, I killed a She-
Goat which had a little Kid by her which she gave Suck to, which
grieved me heartily ; but when the Old one fell, the Kid stood stock
still by her till I came and took her up, and not only so, but when
I carried the Old one with me upon my Shoulders, the Kid folloVd
me quite to my Enclosure, upon which I laid down the Dam, and
took the Kid in my Anns, and carried it over my Pale, in hopes to
have bred it up tame, but it would not eat, so I was forced to kill
it and eat it myself; these two supplied me with Flesh a great

55
while, for I eat sparingly; and saved my Provisions (my Bread
especially) as much as possibly I could.
Having now fixed my Habitation, I found it absolutely necessary
to provide a Place to make a Fire in, and Fuel to burn; and what
I did for that, as also how I enlarg'd my Cave, and what Con-
veniences I made, I shall give a fcll Account of in iu Place: E ;t I

and of my
Thoughts about
Living, which it
may well be sup-
pos'd were not

away upon that
Island without
being driven, as
is said, by a
violent Storm
quite out of the
Course of our
intended Voyage,
and a great Way,
viz. some Hun-
dreds of Leagues
out of the ordinary Course of the Trade of Mankind, I kid great
Reason to consider it as a Determination of Heaven, that in this deso-
late Place, and in this desolate Manner I should end my Life; the
Tears would run plentifully down my Face when I made these Re-
flections, and sometimes I would expostulate with myself, Whj
Providence should thus completely ruin its Creatures, and render
them so absolutely miserable, so without Help abandon'd, so entirely
depress'd, that it could hardly be rational to be thankful for such a
Life

But something always return'd swift upon me to check these
Thoughts, and to reprove me; and particularly one Day walking
r/ith my Gun in my Hand by the Sea-side, I was very pensive upon
the Subject of my present Condition, when Reason as it were expos-
tulated with me the other Way, thus: Well, you are in a desolate Con-
dition it is true, but pray remember, Where are the rest of you? Did
not you come Eleven of you into the Boat, where are the Ten? Why
were not they saved and you lost? Why were you singled out? Is it
better to be here or there? and then I pointed to the Sea. All
Evils are to be consider'd with the Good that is in them, and with
what worse attends them.
Then it occurr'd to me again, how well I was furnish'd for my
Subsistence, and what would have been my Case if it had not hap-
pen'd, Which was an Hundred Thousand to one, that the Ship floated
from the Place where she first struck and was driven so near the
Shore that I had time to get all these Things out of her: What would
have been my Case, if I had been to have lived in the Condition in
which I at first came on Shore, without Necessaries of Life, or Neces-
saries to supply and procure them? Particularly said I aloud, (though
to myself) what should I have done without a Gun, without Ammuni
tion, without any Tools to make anything, or to work with, without
Clothes, Bedding, a Tent, or any manner of Covering, and that now
I had all these to a Sufficient Quantity, and was in a fair way to pro-
vide myself in such a manner, as to live without my Gun when my
Ammunition was spent; so that I had a tolerable View of subsisting
without any Want as long as I lived; for I consider'd from the begin-
ning how I would provide for the Accidents that might happen, and
for the time that was to come, even not only after my Ammunition
should be spent, but even after my Health or Strength should
decay.
I confess I had not entertain'd any Notion of my Ammunition
being destroy'd at one Blast, I mean my Powder being blown up by
Lightning, and this made the Thoughts of it so surprising to me when
it lighten'd and thunder'd, as I observ'd just now.
And now being to enter into a melancholy Relation of a Scene of
silent Life, such perhaps as was never heard of in the World before,
I shall take it from its Beginning, and continue it in its Order. It
was, by my Account, the 30th of Seft. when, in the Manner as above-
said, I first set Foot upon this horiid Island) when the Sun being, to
as, in its Autumnal Equinox, was almost just over my Head, for I
reckon'd myself, Ly Observation, to be in the Latitude of 9 Degrees
aa Minutes North of the Line.
After I had been there about Ten or Twelve Days, it came into
my Thoughts, that I should lose my Reckoning of Time for want ot
Books and Pen and Ink, and should even forget the Sabbath Days
from the working Days; but to prevent this I cut it with my Knife
upon a large Post, in Capital Letters, sud making it into a great
Cross I set it up on the Shore where I first landed, viz. I came on
Shore here on the 3oth of'Sept 1659. Upon the Sides of this square
Post, I cut every Day a Notch with my Knife, and every seventh
Notch was as long again as the rest, and every first Day of the
Month as long again as that long one, and thus I kept my Kalendar,
or weekly, monthly, and yearly reckoning of Time.
In the next place we are to observe, that among the many things
which I brought out of the Ship in the several Voyages, which, a*
above mention'd, I made to it, I got several things of less Value, but
not all less useful to me, which I omitted setting down before; as in
particular, Pens, Ink, and Paper, several Parcels in the Captain's,
Mate's, Gunner's, and Carpenter's keeping, three or four Com-
passes, some Mathematical Instruments, Dials, Perspectives,
Charts, and Books of Navigation, all which I huddled together,
whether I might want them or no; also I found three very good
Bibles which came to me in my Cargo from England, and which I
had packed up among my things; some Portuguese Books also, and
among them two or three Popish Prayer-Books, and several other
Books, all which I carefully secur'd. And I must not forget, that we had
in the Ship a Dog and two Cats, of whose eminent History I may
have occasion to say something in its Place; for I carried both the
Cats with me; and as for the Dog, he jumped out of the Ship ot
himself and swam on Shore to me the Day after I went on Shore
with my first Cargo, and was a trusty Servant to me many Years; I
wanted nothing that he could fetch me, nor any Company that he
could make up to me, I only wanted to have him talk to me, but that
would not do: As I observ'd before, I found Pen, Ink and Paper,
and I husbanded them to the utmost, and I shall show, that while
my Ink lasted, I kept things very exact, but after that was gone, I
could not, for I could not make any Ink by any Means that I couM
devise.
And this put me in mind that I wanted many things, notwithstanding
all that I had amassed together, and of these, this of Ink was one,
as also Spade, Pick-Axe and Shovel, to dig or remove the Earth,
Needles, Pins, and Thread; as for Linen, I soon learned to want that
without much Difficulty.
This want of Tools made every Work I did go on heavily, and it
was near a whole Year before I had entirely finish'd my little Pale or
surrounded Habitation: The Piles or Stakes, which were as heavy as
I could well lift, were a long time in cutting and preparing in the
Woods, and more by far in bringing home, so that I spent sometimes
two Days in cutting and bringing home one of those Posts, and a
third Day in driving it into the Ground; for which Purpose I got a
heavy Piece of Wood at first, but at last bethought myself of one of
the Iron Crows, which however, though I found it, yet it made driving
those Posts or Piles very laborious and tedious Work.
But what need I have been concern'd at the Tediousness of any.
thing I had to do, seeing I had time enough to do it in, nor had I
any other Employment if that had been over, at least, that I could
foresee, except the ranging the Island to seek for Food, which I did
more or less every Day.
I now began to consider seriously my Condition, and the Circum-
stance I was reduc'd to, and I drew up the State of my Affairs in
Writing, not so much to leave them to any that were to come after me,
for I was like to have but few Heirs, as to deliver my Thoughts from
daily poring upon them, and afflicting my Mind; and as my Reason
began now to master my Despondency, I began to comfort myself as
well as I could, and to set the good against the Evil, that I might
have something to distinguish my Case from worse, and I stated it
very impartially, like Debtor and Creditor, the Comforts I enjoy'd,
«gainst the Miseries I suffer'd, Thus,

undoubted Testimony, that thers
was scarce any Condition in the World so miserable, but there was
something Negative or something Positive to be thankful for in it; and
let this stand as a Direction from the Experience of the most mise-
rable of all Conditions in this World, that we may always find in it
something to comfort ourselves from, and to set in the Description of
Good and Evil, on the Credit Side of the Account
Having now brought my Mind a little to relish my Condition, and
given over looking out to Sea to see if I could spy a Ship, I say,
giving over these things, I began to apply myself to accommodate my
way of Living, and to make things as easy to me as I could.
I have already described my Habitation, which was a Tent under
the Side of a Rock, surrounded with a strong Pale of Posts and
Cables, but I might now rather call it a Wall, for I raised a kind of
Wall up against it of Turfs, about two Foot thick on the Outside,
and after some time, I think it was a Year and Half, I raised Rafters
from it leaning to the Rock, and thatched or cover'd it with Boughs
of Trees, and such things as I could get to keep out the Rain, which
I found at some times of the Year very violent
I have already obseiVd how I brought all my Goods into this
Pale, and into the Cave which I had made behind me s But I must
observe too, that at first this was a confus'd Heap of Goods, which as
they lay in no Order, so they took up all my Place, I had no room
to turn myself; so I set myself to enlarge my Cave and Works far-
ther into the Earth, for it was a loose sandy Rock, which yielded
easily to the Labour I bestow'd on it: And so when I found I was
pretty safe as to Beasts of Prey, I worked sideways to the Right
Hand into the Rock, and then turning to the Right again, worked
quite out and made me a Door to come out, on the Outside of my
Pale or Fortification.
This gave me not only Egress and Regress, as it were a Back-way
to my Tent and to my Storehouse, but gave me room to stow my
Goods.
And now I began to apply myself to make such necessary things
as I found I most wanted, as particularly a Chair and a Table, for
without these I was not able to enjoy the few Comforts I had in the
World, I could not write, or eat, or do several things with so much
Pleasure without a Table.
So I went to work; and here I must needs observe, that as Reason
is the Substance and Original of the Mathematics, so by stating
and squaring everything by Reason, and by making the most rational
Judgment of things, every Man may be in time Master of every me-
chanic Art I had never handled a Tool in my Life, and yet in
time by Labour, Application, and Contrivance, I found at last that I
wanted nothing but I could have made it, especially if I had had
Tools; however I made abundance of things, even without Tools,
and some with no more Tools than an Adze and a Hatchet, which
perhaps were never made that way before, and that with infinite
Labour: For Example, If I wanted a Board, I had no other Way but
to cut down a Tree, set it on an Edge before me, and hew it flat on
either Side with my Axe, till I had brought it to be thin as a Plank,
and then dubb it smooth with my Adze. It is true, by this Method
1 could make but one Board out of a whole Tree, but this I had no
Remedy for but Patience, any more than I had for the prodigious
deal of Time and Labour which it took me up to make a Plank or
Board: But my Time or Labour was little worth, and so it was as
well employ'd one way as another.
However, I made me a Table and a Chair, as I observ'd above, in
the first Place, and this I did out of the short Pieces of Boards that I
I
ftrought on my Raft from the Ship: But when I had wrought out
some Boards, as above, I made large Shelves of the Breadth of a
Foot and Half one over another, all along one Side of my Cave, to
lay all my Tools, Nails, and Ironwork, and in a Word, to separate
everything at large in their Places, that I might come easily at them;
I knocked Pieces into the Wall of the Rock to hang my Guns and all
things that would hang up.
So that had my Cave been to be seen, it looked like a general
Magazine of all Necessary things, and I had everything so ready at
my Hand, that it was a great Pleasure to me to see all my Goods in
such Order, and especially to find my Stock of all Necessaries so
great
And now it was when I began to keep a Journal of every Day's
Employment, for indeed at first I was in too much Hurry, and not
only Hurry as to Labour, but in too much Discomposure of Mind,
and my Journal would have been full of many dull things: For Example,
I must have said thus. Sept. the 30th. After I got to Shore and had
escap'd drowning, instead of being thankful to God for my Delive-
rance, having first vomited with the great Quantity of salt Watei
which was gotten into my Stomach, and recovering myself a little, I
ran about the Shore, wringing my Hands and beating my Head and
Face, exclaiming at my Misery, and crying out, I was undone, un-
done, till tired and faint I was forced to lie down on the Ground to
repose, but durst not sleep for fear of being devour'd.
Some Days after this, and after I had been on board the Ship, ?nd
got all that I could out of her, yet I could not forbear getting up to
the Top of a little Mountain and looking out to Sea in hopes of
seeing a Ship, then fancy at a vast Distance I spied a Sail, please my-
self with the Hopes of it, and then after looking steadily till I was
almost blind, lose it quite, and sit down and weep like a Child,
and thus increase my Misery by my Folly.
But having gotten over these things in some Measure, and having
settled my household Stuff and Habitation, made me a Table and a
Chair, and all as handsome about me as I could, I began to keep
my Journal, of which I shall here give you the Copy (though in it will
be told all these Particulars over again) as long as it lasted, ftw
having no more Ink I was forced to leave it off
THE JOURNAL.
September 30, 1659. I poor miserable Robinson Crusoe, being ship-
wreck'd, during a dreadful Storm, in the offing, came on Shore on this
dismal unfortunate Island, which I called the Island of Despair, all
the rest of the Ship's Company being drowned, and myself almost
dead.
All the rest of that
Day I spent in af-
flicting myself at the
dismal Circumstan-
ces I was brought
to, viz. I had neither
Food, House,
Clothes, Weapon, or
Place to fly to, and
in Despair of any
Relief, saw noJiing
but Death before me,
either that I should
be devour'd by wild
Beasts, murdered by
Savages, or starved to
Death for Want of
Food. At the Ap-
proach of Night, I slept in a Tree for fear of wild Creatures, but
slept soundly though it rained all Night
October r. In the Morning I saw to my great Surprise the Ship
had floated with the high Tide, and was driven on Shore again much
nearer the Island, which as it was some Comfort on one hand, for
seeing her sit upright, and not broken to Pieces, I hoped, if the Wind
abated, I might get on board, and get some Food and Necessaries
out of her for my Relief; so on the other hand, it renew'd my Grief
at the Loss of my Comrades, who I imagin'd if we had all stayed on
board might have saved the Ship, or at least that they would not have
been all drowned as they were; and that had the Men been saved, we
might perhaps have built us a Boat out of the Ruins of the Ship, to
nave carried us to some other Part of (he World. I spent great Part

fif this Day in perplexing myself on these things; but at length
seeing the Ship almost dry, I went upon the Sand as near as I could,
and then swam on board; this Day also i. continu'd raining, though
with no Wind at all.
From the ist of October to the 24th. All these Days entirely npent
in many several Voyages to get all I could out of the Ship, which I
brought on Shore, every Tide of Flood, upon Rafts. Much Rain
also in these Days, though with some Intervals of fair Weather: But,
it seems, this was the rainy Season.
Oct. 20. I overset my Raft, and all the Goods I had got upon it,
but being in shoal Water, and the tilings being chiefly heavy, I re-
cover'd many of them when the Tide was out
Oct. 35. It rained all Night and all Day, with some Gusts of Wind,
during which time the Ship broke in Pieces, the Wind blowing a little
harder than before, and was no more to be seen, except the Wreck
of her, and that only at low Water. I spent this Day in covering
and securing the Goods which I had saved, that the Rain might
not spoil them.
Oct. 16. I walked about the Shore almost all Day to find out
l place to fix my Habitation, greatly concern'd to secure myself
from an Attack in the Night, either from wild Beasts or Men. To-
wards Night I fixed upon a proper Place under a Rock, and marked
out a Semicircle for my Encampment, which I resolv'd to strengthen
with a Work, Wall, or Fortification made of double Piles, lined within
with Cables, and without with Turfs.
From the 26th to the 30th I worked very hard in carrying all my
Goods to my new Habitation, though some part of the time it rained
exceeding hard.
The 31st in the Morning I went out into the Island with my Gun
to see for some Food, and discover the Country, when I killed a She-
Goat, and her Kid follow'd me home, which I afterwards killed also,
because it would not feed.
November 1. I set up my Tent under a Rock, and lay there for
the first Night, making it as large as I could with Stakes driven in to
swing my Hammock upon.
Nov. 2. I set up all my Chests and Boards, and the Pieces of
Timber which made my Rafts, and with them formed a Fence
round me, a little within the Place I had marked out for my
Fortification.
Nov. 3. I went out with my Gun, and killed two Fowls like
Ducks, which were very good Food . In the Afternoon went to
work to make me a Table.
Nov. 4. This Morning I began to order my times of Work, of
going out with my Gun, time of Sleep, and time of Diversion, viz.
Every Morning I walked out with my Gun for two or three Hours
if it did not rain, then employ'd myself to work till about Eleven',
o'clock, then eat what I had to live on, and from Twelve to Twol,
I lay down to sleep, the Weather being excessive hot, and then in
the Evening to work again: The working Part of this Day and of
the next were wholly employ'd in making my Table, for I was yet
but a very sorry Workman, though Time and Necessity made me a
complete natural Mechanic soon after, as I believe it would do any
one else.
Nov. 3. This Day went abroad with my Gun and my Dog, and
killed a wild Cat, her Skin pretty soft, but her Flesh good for nothing:
Every Creature I killed, I took off the Skins and preserv'd them:
Coming back by the Sea-Shore, I saw many Sorts of Sea-Fowls, which
I did not understand; but was surpriz'd, and almost frighted with
two or three Seals, which, while I was gazing at, not well knowing
what they were, got into the Sea, and escap'd me for that time.
Nov. 6. After my Morning Walk I went to work with my Table
again, and finish'd it, though not to my liking; nor was it long before
I learnt to mend it
Nov. 7. Now it began to be settled fair Weather. The 7th, 8th,
9th, 10th, and part of the 12th, (for the nth was Sunday) I took
wholly up to make me a Chair, and with much ado brought it to a
tolerable Shape, but never to please me, and even in the making I
pulled it in Pieces several times. Note, I soon neglected my keeping . -
Sundays, for omitting my Mark for them on my Post, I forgot which
was which.
Nov. 13. This Day it rained, which refresh'd me exceedingly, and
cooled the Earth, but it was accompany'd with terrible Thunder and
Lightning, which frighted me dreadfully for fear of my Powder; ay
loon as it was over, I resolv'd to separate my Stock of Powder into
as many little Parcels as possible, that it might not be in Danger.
Nov. 14, 15, 16. These three Days I spent in making little square
Chests or Boxes, which might hold about a Pound, or two Pound, at
most, of Powder' and 10 putting the Powder in, I (towed it vs

Places as secure and remote from one another as possible. On one
of these three Days I killed a large Bird that was good to eat, but I
know not what to call it
Nov. 17. This Day I began to dig behind my Tent into the
Rock to make room for my farther Conveniency: Note, Two
Things I wanted exceedingly for
this Work, viz. a Pick-axe, a
Shovel, and a Wheel-barrow or
Basket, so I desisted from my
Work, and began to consider how $LMBbiS»i'>
to supply that Want and make
me some Tools ; as for a Pick-axe,
I made use of the Iron Crows, I \ ii BfcJ&^gt j p^'/i
which were proper enough, though
heavy; but the next thing was a
Shovel or Spade; this was so
absolutely necessary, that indeed
I could do nothing effectually
without it, but what kind of one
to make I knew not
Nov. 18. The next Day in
searching the Woods I found a
Tree of that Wood, or like it, which, in the Brasils they call the Iron
Tree, for its exceeding Hardness, of this, with great Labour and
almost spoiling my Axe, I cut a Piece, and brought it home too with
Difficulty enough, for it was exceeding heavy.
The excessive Hardness of the Wood, and having no other Way,
made me a long while upon this Machine, for I worked it effectually
by little and little into the Form of a Shovel or Spade, the Handle
exactly shaped like ours in England, only that the broad Part having
no Iron shod upon it at Bottom, it would not last me so long, how-
ever it served well enough for the uses which I had occasion to put it
to; but never was a Shovel, I believe, made after that Fashion, or so
long a making.
I was still deficient, for I wanted a Basket or a Wheel-barrow, a
Basket I could not make by any Means, having no such things as
Twigs that would bend to make Wicker Ware, at least none yet found
out; and as to a Wheel-barrow, I fancy'd I could make all but the
Wheel, but that I had no Notion of, neither did I know how to go

about it; besides I had no possible Way to make the Iron Gudgeons
for the Spindle or Axis of the Wheel to run in, so I gave it over, and
so for carrying away the Earth which I dug out of the Cave, I made
me a Thing like a Hod, which the Labourers carry Mortar in, when
they serve the Bricklayers.
This was not so difficult to me as the making the Shovel; and yet
this, and the Shovel, and the Attempt which I made in vain, to make
a Wheel-barrow, took me up no less than four Days, I mean always,
excepting my Morning Walk with my Gun, which-1-seldom failed, and
very seldom failed also bringing Home something fit to eat
Nov. 23. My other Work having now stood still, because of my
making these Tools; when they were finish'd, I went on, and work-
ing every Day, as my Strength and Time aHow'd, I spent eighteen
Days entirely in widening and deepening my Cave, that it might
hold my Goods commodiously.
Note, During all this Time, I worked to make this Room or Cave
spacious enough to accommodate me as a Warehouse or Magazine, a
Kitchen, a Dining-room, and a Cellar; as for my Lodging, I kept to
the Tent, except that Sometimes in the wet Season of the Year, it
rained so hard, that I could not keep myself dry, which caused me
afterwards to cover all my Place within my Pale with long Poles in
the Form of Rafters leaning against the Rock, and load them with
Flags and large Leaves of Trees like a Thatch.
December 10. I began now to think my Cave or Vault finished, when
on a Sudden (it seems I had made it too large) a great Quantity of
Earth fell down from the Top and one Side, so much, that in short it
frighted me, and not without Reason too; for if I had been under
it I had never wanted a Grave-digger: Upon this Disaster I had
a great deal of Work to do over again; for I had the loose
Earth to carry out; and which was of more Importance, I had the
Ceiling to prop up, so that I might be sure no more would come down.
Dec. n. This Day I went to Work with it accordingly, and got
two Shores or Posts pitched upright to the Top, with two Pieces of
Boards across over each Post, this I finished the next Day; and
setting more Posts up with Boards, in about a WeeK more I had the
Roof secur'd; and the Posts standing in Rows, served me for Parti-
tions to part off my House.
Dec. 17. From this Day to the Twentieth I placed Shelves, and
knocked up Nails on the Posts to hang everything up that could be
hung up, and now I began to be in some Order within Doors,
De.. ao. Now I carry'd everything into the Cave, and began to
famish my House, and set up some Pieces of Boards, like a Dresser,
to order my Victual* upon, but Boards began to be very scarce with
me; also I made me another Table.
Dec. 24. Much Rain all Night and all Day, no stirring out
Dec. 25. Rain all Day.
Dec. ao\ No Rain, and the Earth much cooler than before, and
pleasanter.
Dec. 27. Killed a young Goat, and lamed another so that I caught
it and led it Home in a String; when I had it Home, I bound and
splinter'd up its Leg which was broke. N.B. I took such Care of it,
that it lived, and the Leg grew well and as strong as ever; but by my
nursing it so long it grew tame, and fed upon the little Green at my
Door, and would not go away: This was the first Time that I enter-
tain'd a Thought of breeding up some tame Creatures, that I might
have Food when my Powder and Shot was all spent
Dec. 28, 29, 30. Great Heats and no Breeze; so that there was
no Stirring abroad, except in the Evening for Food; this Time I spent
in putting all my Things in Order within Doors.
January 1. Very hot still, but I went abroad early and late with
my Gun, and lay still in the Middle of the Day; this Evening going
farther into the Valleys which lay towards the Centre of the Island,
I found there was plenty of Goats, though exceeding shy and hard to
come at, however I resolv'd to try if I could not bring my Dog to
hunt them down.
Jan. a. Accordingly, the next Day, I went out with my Dog, and
set him upon the Goats; but I was mistaken, for they all faced about
upon the Dog, and he knew his Danger too well, for he would not
come near them.
Jan. 3. I began my Fence or Wall; which being still jealous of my
being attack'd by somebody, I resolv'd to make very thick and strong.
N.B. This Wall being describ'd before, I purposely omit what
was said in the Journal; it is sufficient to observe, that I was
no less Time than from the 3rd of January to the \t,th of
April, working, finishing and perfecting this Wall, though it
was no more than about 24 Yards in Length, being a half-
Circle from one Place in the Rock to another Place about eight
Yards from it, the Door of the Cave being in the Centre b&
Aind*. -
All this Time I worked very hard, the Rains hindering me man;
Days, nay sometimes Weeks together; but I thought I should never
be perfectly secure till this Wall was finished; and it is scarce cre-
dible what inexpressible Labour everything was done with, espe-
cially the bringing Piles out of the Woods, and driving them into the
Ground, for I made them much bigger than I need to have done.
When this Wall was finished, and the Outside double fenced with
a Turf-Wall raised up to close it, I persuaded myself that if any People
were to come on Shore there, they would not perceive anything like
a Habitation; and it was very well I did so, as may be observ'd
hereafter upon a very remarkable Occasion.
During this Time, I made my Rounds in the Woods for Game
every Day when the Rain admitted me, and made frequent Dis-
coveries in these Walks of something or other to my Advantage;
particularly I found a Kind of wild Pigeons, who built not as Wood
Pigeons in a Tree, but rather as House Pigeons, in the Holes of the
Rocks; and taking some young ones, I endeavoured to breed them
up tame, and did so; but when they grew older they flew all away,
which perhaps was at first for Want of feeding them, for I had
nothing to give them; however I frequently found their Nests, and
got their young ones, which were very good Meat
And now, in the managing my household Affairs, I found myself
wanting in many Things, which I thought at first it was impossible
for me to make, as indeed as to some of them it was; for Instance, I
could never make a Cask to be hooped, I had a small Runlet or two,
as I observed before, but I could never arrive to the Capacity of making
one by them, though I spent many Weeks about it; I could neither
put in the Heads, or joint the Staves so true to one another, as to
make them hold Water, so I gave that also over.
In the next Place, I was at a great Loss for Candle; so that as
soon as ever it was dark, which was generally by Seven o'clock,
I was oblig'd to go to Bed: I remembered the Lump of Beeswax
with which I made Candles in my African Adventure, but I
had none of that now; the only Remedy I had was, that when
I had killed a Goat, I saved the Tallow, and with a little Dish made
of Clay, which I baked in the Sun, to which I added a Wick of some
Oakum, I made me a Lamp; and this gave me Light, though not a
clear steady Light like a Candle; in the Middle of all my labours
it happen'd, that rummaging my Things, I found a l'Ule Bag, which,
as 1 hinted before, had been filled with Cor n for the feeding of Poultry,
Dot for this Voyage, but before, as I suppose, when the Ship came from
Lisbon, what little Remainder of Corn had been in the Bag, was all
devour'd with the Rats, and I saw nothing in the Bag but Husks and
Dust; and being willing to have the Bag for some other Use, I think
it was to put Powder in, when I divided it for Fear of the Lightning,
or some such Use, I shook the Husks of Corn out of it on one Side
of my Fortification under the Rock.
It was a little be/ore the great Rains, just now mention'd, that I
threw this Stuff away, taking no Notice of anything, and not so much
as remembering that I had thrown anything there; when about a
Month after, or thereabout, I saw some few Stalks of something
green, shooting out of the Ground, which I fancied might be some
Plant I had not seen, but I was surpris'd and perfectly astonish'd,
when, after a little longer Time, I saw about ten or twelve Ears come
out, which were perfect green Barley of the same Kind as our
European, nay, as our English Barley.
It is impossible to express the Astonishment and Confusion of my
Thoughts on this Occasion; I had hitherto acted upon no religious
Foundation at all, indeed I had very few Notions of Religion in my
Head, or had entertain'd any Sense of anything that had befallen me,
otherwise than as a Chance, or, as we lightly say, what pleases God;
without so much as inquiring into the End of Providence in these
Things, or his Order in governing Events in the World: But after I
saw Barley grow there, in a Climate which I know was not proper for
Corn, and especially that I knew not how it came there, it startled
me strangely, and I began to suggest, that God had miraculously
caused this Grain to grow without any Help of Seed sown, and that it
was so directed purely for my Sustenance, on that wild miserable
Place.
This touched my Heart a little, and brought Tears out of my Eyes,
and I began to bless myself, that such a Prodigy of Nature should
happen upon my Account; and this was the more strange to me, be-
cause I saw near it still all along by the Side of the Rock, some other
straggling Stalks, which proved to be Stalks of Rice, and which I knew,
because I had seen it grow in Africa, when I was ashore there.
I not only thought these the pure Productions of Providence for
my Support, but not doubting, but that there was more in the Place,
I went all over that Part of the Island, where I had been before, peer-
ing In every Corner, and under every Rock, to see for more of it, but
I could not find any; at last it occur'd to my Thoughts, that I had
shook a Bag of Chickens' Meat out in that Place, and then the
Wonder began to cease; and I must confess, my religious Thankful-
ness to God's Providence began to abate too upon the Discovering
that all this was nothing but what was common; though I ought to have
been as thankful for so strange and unforeseen Providence, as if it had
oeen miraculous; for it was really the Work of Providence as to me,
that should order or appoint, that 10 or 12 Grains of Corn should
remain unspoil'd (when the Rats had destroy'd all the rest,) as if it
had been dropped from Heaven; as also, that I should throw it out in
that particular Place, where it being in the Shade of a high Rock, it
sprang up immediately; whereas, if I had thrown it anywhere else, at
that Time, it had been burnt up and destroy'd.
I carefully saved the Ears of this Cor n you may be sure in then-
Season, which was about the End of June; and laying up every Corn,
I resolv'd to sow them all again, hoping in Time to have some
Quantity sufficient to supply me with Bread; But it was not till the
4th Year that I could allow myself the least Grain of this Cor n to
«at, and even then but sparingly, as I shall say afterwards in its
Order; for I lost all that I sowed the first Season, by not observing
the proper Time; for I sowed it just before the dry Season, so that it
never came up at all, at least, not as it would have done: Of which in
its Place.
Besides this Barley, there was, as above, 20 or 30 Stalks of Rice,
which I preserv'd with the same Care, and whose Use was of the
same Kind or to the same Purpose, (viz.) to make me Bread, or
rather Food; for I found Ways to cook it up without baking, though
I did that also after some Time. But to return to my Journal.
I worked excessive hard these three or four Months to get my Wall
done; and the 14th of April I closed it up, contriving to go into it,
/lot by a Door, but over the Wall by a Ladder, that there might be
no Sign in the Outside of my Habitation.
April 16. I finish'd the Ladder, so I went up with the Ladder to
the Top, and then pulled it up after me, and let it down in the Inside:
This was a complete Enclosure to me; for within I had Room
enough, and nothing could come at me from without, unless it could
first mount my Wall
.
The very next Day after this Wall was finish'd, I had almost had
7i
all my Labour overthrown at once, and myself killed, the Case was
thus, As I was busy in the Inside of it, behind my Tent, just in the
Entrance into my Cave, I was terribly frighted with a most dread-
ful surprising Thing indeed; for all on a sudden I found the Earth
come crumbling down from the Roof of my Cave, and from the Edge
of the Hill over my Head, and two of the Posts I had set
up in the Cave cracked in a frightful Manner: I was heartily
scared, but thought nothing of what was really the Cause, only
thinking that the Top of my Cave was falling in, as some of
it had done before; and for Fear I should be buried in it, I
ran forward to my Ladder, and not thinking myself safe there
neither, I got over my Wall for Fear of the Pieces of the Hill which I
expected might roll down upon me: I was no sooner stept down
upon the firm Ground, but I plainly saw it was a terrible Earthquake,
for the Ground I stood on shook three Times at about eight Minutes'
Distance, with three such Shocks, as would have overturn'd the
strongest Building that could be suppos'd to have stood on the Earth,
and a great Piece of the Top of a Rock, which stood about half a
Mile from me next the Sea, fell down with such a terrible Noise, as I
nsver heard in all my Life, I perceiv'd also, the very Sea was put
into violent Motion by it; and I believe the Shocks were stronger
under the Water than on the Island.
I was so amazed with the Thing itself, having never felt the like, or
discours'd with any one that had, that I was like one dead or
stupify'd; and the Motion of the Earth made my Stomach sick like
one that was tossed at Sea; but the Noise of the falling of the Rock
awaked me as it were, and rousing me from the stupify'd Condition I
was in, filled me with Horror, and I thought of nothing then but the
Hill falling upon my Tent and all my household Goods, and burying
all at once; and this sunk my very Soul within me a second Time.
After the third Shock was over, and I felt no more for some Time,
I began to take Courage, and yet I had not Heart enough to go over
my Wall again, for Fear of being buried alive, but sat still upon the
Ground, greatly cast down and disconsolate, not knowing what to do:
All this while I had not the least serious religious Thought, nothing
but the common, Lord have Mercy upon me; and when it was over,
that went away too.
While I sat thus, I found the Air overcast, and grow cloudy, as if it
would Rain; soon after that the Wind rose, by little and little, so that, in
less than half an Hour, it blew a most dreadful Hurricane: The Sea
was all on a Sudden cover'd with Foam and Froth, the Shore was
cover'd with the Breach of the Water, the Trees were torn up by the
Roots, and a terrible Storm it was; and this held about three Hours,
and then began to abate, and in two Hours more it was stark calm,
and began to rain very hard.
All this while I sat upon the Ground very much terrify'd and de-
jected, when on a sudden it came into my thoughts, that these Windi
and Rain being the Consequences of the Earthquake, the Earthquake
itself was spent and over, and I might venture into my Cave again:
With this Thought my Spirits began to revive, and the Rain also
helping to persuade me, I went in and sat down in my Tent, but the
Rain was so violent, that my Tent was ready to be beaten down with
it, and I was forced to go into my Cave, though very much afraid
and uneasy for fear it should fall on my Head.
This violent Rain forced me to a new Work, viz. To cut a Hole
through my new Fortification like a Sink to let the Water go out, which
would else have drowned my Cave. After I had been in my Cave
some time, and found still no more Shocks of the Earthquake follow,
I began to be more compos'd; and now to support my Spirits, which
indeed wanted it very much, I went to my little Store and took a
small Sup of Rum, which however I did then and always very spa-
ringly, knowing I could have no more when that was gone.
It continu'd raining all that Night, and great Part of the next Day,
so that I could not stir abroad, but my Mind being more compos'd, I
began to think of what I had best do, concluding that if the Island
was subject to these Earthquakes, there would be no living for me in
a Cave, but I must consider of building me some little Hut in an
open Place which I might surround with a Wall as I had done here,
and so make myself secure from wild Beasts or Men; but concluded,
if I stayed where I was, I should certainly, one time or other, be
bury'd alive.
With these Thoughts I resolv'd to remove my Tent from the Place
where it stood, which was just under the hanging Precipice of the Hill,
and which, if it should be shaken again, would certainly fall upon my
Tent: And I spent the two next Days, being the 19th and aoth of
April, in contriving where and how to remove my Habitation.
The fear of being swallow' d up alive, made me that I never slept in
quiet, and yet the Apprehensions of lying abroad without any Fence
7J
was almost equal to it; but still when I looked about and saw how
everything was put in order, how pleasantly conceal'd I was, and
how safe from Danger, it made me very loth to remove.
In the meantime it occurr'd to me that it would require a vast
deal of time for me to do this, and that I must be contented to run
the Venture where I was, till I had formed a Camp for myself, and had
secur'd it so as to remove to it: So with this Resolution I compos'd
myself for a time, and resolv'd that I would go to work with all
Speed to build me a Wall with Piles and Cables, &*c, in a Circle as
before, and set my Tent up in it when it was finish'd, but that I
would venture to stay where I was till it was finish'd and fit to re-
move to. This was the 21 st
April 22. The next Morning I began to consider of Means to put
this Resolve in Execution, but I was at a great loss about my Tools;
I had three large Axes and abundance of Hatchets, (for we carried
the Hatchets for Traffic with the Indians) but with much chopping
and cutting knotty hard Wood, they were all full of Notches and
dull, and though I had a Grindstone I could not turn it and grind my
Tools too, this cost me
as much Thought as a
Statesman would have
bestow'd upon a grand
Point of Politics, or
a Judge upon the Life
and Death of a Man.
At length I contriv'd
a Wheel with a String,
to turn it with my
Foot, that I might
have both my Hands
at Liberty: Note, I
had never seen any
such thing in England,
or at least not to take Notice how it was done, though since I have
obseiVd it is very common there; besides that, my Grindstone
was very large and heavy. This Machine cost me a full Week's
Work to bring it to Perfection.
April 28, 29. These two whole Days I took up in grinding my
Tools, my Machine for turning my Grindstone performing very well.

April 30. Having perceiv'd my Bread had been low a great while,
now I took a Survey of it, and reduc'd myself to one Biscuit-cake a
Day, which made my Heart very heavy.
May 1. In, the Morning looking towards the Sea-side, the
Tide being low, I saw something lie on the Shore bigger than
ordinary, and it looked like a Cask, when I came to it, I found a
small Barrel, and two or three Pieces of the Wreck of the Ship, which
were driven on Shore by the late Hurricane, and looking towards
the Wreck itself, I thought it seemed to lie higher out of the Water
than it used to do; I examin'd the Barrel which was driven on Shore,
and soon found it was a Barrel of Gunpowder, but it had taken
Water, and the Powder was caked as hard as a stone, however
I rolled it farther on Shore for the present, and went on upon the
Sands as near as I could to the Wreck of the Ship to look for
more.
When I came down to the Ship I found it strangely remov'd,
The Forecastle, which lay befored bury'd in Sand was heaved up at
least Six Foot, and the Stern, which was broke to Pieces and parted
from the rest by the Force of the Sea soon after I had left rum-
maging her, was tossed, as it were, up, and cast on one Side, and the
Sand was thrown so high on that Side next her Stern, that where-
as there was a great Place of Water before, so that I could not come
within a Quarter of a Mile of the Wreck without swimming, I could
now walk quite up to her when the Tide was out; I was surpris'd
with this at first, but soon concluded it must be done by the Earth-
quake, and as by this Violence the Ship was more broken open than
formerly, so many Things came daily on Shore, which the Sea had
loosen'd, and which the Winds and Water rolled by Degrees to the
Land.
This wholly diverted my Thoughts from the Design of removing
my Habitation; and I busied myself mightily that Day especially, in
searching whether I could make any Way into the Ship, but I found
nothing was to be expected of that Kind, for that all the Inside of
the Ship was choked up with sand: However, as I had learned not
to despair of anything, I resolv'd to pull everything to Pieces that
I could of the Ship, concluding, that everything I got from her
would be of some Use or other to me.
May 3. I began with my Saw, and cut a Piece of a Beam through,
which I thought held some of the upper Part or Quarter-Deck together,
and when I had cut it through, I cleared away the Sand as well
as I could from the Side which lay highest; but the Tide coming
in, I was oblig'd to give over for that Time.
May 4. I went a fishing, but caught not one Fish that I durst eat
of, till I was weary of my Sport, when just going to leave off, I
caught a young Dolphin. I had made me a long Line of some Rope
Yarn, but I had no Hooks, yet I frequently caught Fish enough,
as much as I cared to eat; all which I dried in the Sun, and eat
them dry.
May 5. Worked on the Wreck, cut another Beam asunder, and
brought three great Fir Planks off from the Decks, which I tied to
gether, and made swim on Shore when the Tide of Flood came on.
May 6. Worked on the Wreck, got several Iron Bolts out of her,
and other Pieces of Iron-Work, worked very hard, and came Home
very much tired, and had Thoughts of giving it over.
May 7. Went to the Wreck again, but with an Intent not to
work, but found the Weight of the Wreck had broke itself down, the
Beams being cut, that several Pieces of the Ship seemed to lie loose,
and the Inside of the Hold lay so open, that I could see into it, but
almost full of Water and Sand.
May 8. Went to the Wreck, and carry'd an Iron Crow to wrench
up the Deck, which lay now quite clear of the Water or Sand; I
wrenched open two Planks, and brought them on Shore also with
the Tide: I left the Iron Crow in the Wreck for next Day.
May 9. Went to the Wreck, and with the Crow made Way into
the Body of the Wreck, and felt several Casks, and loosen'd them
with the Crow, but could not break them up; I felt also the Roll of
English Lead, and could stir it, but it was too heavy to remove.
May 10, 11, ia, 13, 14. Went every Day to the Wreck, and got
a great deal of Pieces of Timber, and Boards, or Plank, and 2 or
300 Weight of Iron.
May 15. I carry'd two Hatchets to try if I could not cut a Piece
off of the Roll of Lead, by placing the Edge of one Hatchet, and
driving it with the other; but as it lay about a Foot and a half in the
Water, I could not make any Blow to drive the Hatchet
May 16. It had blowed hard in the Night, and the Wreck ap-
pea^d more broken by the Force of the Water; but I stayed so long
in the Woods to get Pigeons for Food, that the Tide prevented mf
going to the Wreck that Day,
ADVENTURES OF
May i j. I saw some Pieces of the Wreck blown on Shore, at a
great Distance, near two Miles off me, but resolv'd to see what they
were, and found it was a Piece of the Head, but too heavy for me to
bring away.
May 24. Every Day to this Day I worked on the Wreck, and with
hard Labour I loosen'd some Things so much with the Crow, that the
first blowing Tide several Casks floated out, and two of the Seamen's
Chests; but the Wind blowing from the Shore, nothing came to
Land that Day, but Pieces of Timber, and a Hogshead which had
some Brazil Pork in it, but the Salt-water and the Sand had
spoiled it
I continu'd this Work every Day to the 15th of June, except the
Time necessary to get Food, which I always appointed, during this
Part of my Employment, to be when the Tide was up, that I might
be ready when it was ebbed out, and by this Time I had gotten Tim-
ber, and Plank, and Iron-Work enough, to have builded a good Boat,
if I had known how; and also, I got at several Times, and in seve-
ral Pieces, near 100 Weight of the Sheet-Lead.
June 16. Going
down to the Sea-side,
I found a large Tor-
toise or Turtle; this
was the first I had
seen, which it seems
was only my Misfor-
tune, not any Defect
of the Place, or
Scarcity; for had I
happen'd to be on
the other Side of the
Island, I might have
had Hundreds of them
every Day, as I found afterwards; but perhaps had paid dear
enough for them.
June 17. I spent in cooking the Turtle; I found in her threescore
Eggs; and her Flesh was to me at that Time the most savoury and
pleasant that ever I tasted in my Life, having had no Flesh, but of
Goats and Fowls, since I landed in this horrid Place.
June 18. Rained all Day, and I stayed within. I thought at this

Time the Rain felt Cold, and I was something chilly, which I knew
was not usual in that Latitude.
June 19. Very ill, and shivering, as if the Weather had been cold.
June 20. No Rest all Night, violent Pains in my Head, and
feverish.
June 2 1. Very ill, frighted almost to Death with the Apprehen-
sions of my sad Condition, to be sick, and no Help : Prayed to GOD
for the first Time since the Storm off of Hull, but scarce knew what
I said, or why; my Thoughts being all confused.
June 21. A little better, but under dreadful Apprehensions of
Sickness.
June 23. Very bad again, cold and shivering, and then a violent
Headache.
June 34. Much better.
June 25. An Ague very violent; the Fit held me seven Hours,
cold Fit and hot, with faint Sweats after it
June 26. Better; and having no Victuals to eat, took my Gun,
but found myself very weak; however I killed a She-Goat, and with
much Difficulty got it Home, and broiled some of it, and eat; I would
fain have stewed it, and made some Broth, but had no Pot
June 27. The Ague again so violent, that I lay a-Bed all Day, and
neither eat or drank. I was ready to perish for Thirst, but so weak,
I had not Strength to stand up, or to get myself any Water to drink:
Prayed to God again, but was light-headed, and when I was not, I was
so ignorant, that I knew not what to say; only I lay and cried, Lord
look upon me, Lord pity me, Lord have Mercy upon me: I suppose I
did nothing else for two or three Hours, till the Fit wearing off, I fell
asleep, and did not wake till far in the Night; when I waked, I found
myself much refresh'd, but weak, and exceeding thirsty: However,
as I had no Water in my whole Habitation, I was forced to lie till
Morning, and went to sleep again: In this second Sleep, I had
this terrible Dream.
I thought, that I was sitting on the Ground on the Outside of my
Wall, where I sat when the Storm blew after the Earthquake, and that
I saw a Man descend from a great black Cloud, in a bright Flame of
Fire, and light upon the Ground: He was all over as bright as a
Flame, so that I could but just bear to look towards him; his Counte-
nance was most inexpressibly dreadful, impossible for Words to
describe; when he stepped upon the Ground with his Feet, I thought
the Earth trembled, just as it had done before in the Earthquake,
and all the Air looked, to my Apprehension, as if it had been filled
with Flashes of Fire.
He was no sooner landed upon the Earth, but he moved forward to-
wards me, with a long Spear or Weapon in his Hand, to kill me; and
when he came to a rising Ground, at some Distance, he spoke to me,
or I heard a Voice so terrible, that it is impossible to express the
Terror of it; all that I can say, I understood, was this, Seeing all
tIuse Things have not brought thee to Repentance, now thou shalt die:
At which Words, I thought he lifted up the Spear that was in his
Hand, to kill me.
No one, that shall ever read this Account, will expect that I
should be able to describe the Horrors of my Scul »t this terrible
Vision, I mean, that even while it was a Dream, I even dreamed of
those Horrors; nor is it any more possible to describe the Impres-
sion that remain'd upon my Mind when I awak'd and found it was
but a Dream.
I had alas! no divine Knowledge; what I had received by the
good Instruction of my Father was then worn out by an uninterrupted
Series, for 8 Years, of Seafaring Wickedness, and a constant Conversa-
tion with nothing but such as were like myself, wicked and profane
to the last Degree: I do not remember that I had in all that Time
one Thought that so much as tended either to looking upwards toward
God, or inwards towards a Reflection upon my own Ways: But a
certain Stupidity of Soul, without Desire of Good, or Conscience of
Evil, had entirely overwhelm'd me, and I was all that the most
hardened, unthinking, wicked Creature among our common Sailors,
can be supposed to be, not having the least Sense, either of the Fear
of God in Danger, or of Thankfulness to God in Deliverances.
In the relating what is already past of my Story, this will be the
more easily believ'd, when I shall add, that through all the Variety of
Miseries that had to this Day befallen me, I never had so much as one
Thought of it being the Hand of God, or that it was a just Punish-
ment for my Sin; my rebellious Behaviour against my Father, or my
present Sins which were great; or so much as a Punishment for the
general Course of my wicked Life. When I was on the desperate
Expedition on the desert Shores of Africa, I never had so much as
one Thought of what would become of me; or one Wish to God to
direct me whither I should go, or to keep me from the Danger which
apparently surrounded me, as well from voracious Creatures as
cruel Savages: But I was merely thoughtless of a God, or a Provi-
dence; acted like a mere Brute from the Principles of Nature,
and by the Dictates of common Sense only, and indeed hardly
that
When I was deliver^ and taken up at Sea by the Portugal Captain,
well used, and dealt justly and honourably with, as well as charitably,
I had not the least Thankfulness on my Thoughts : When again I was
shipwreck'd, ruined, and in Danger of drowning on this Island, I was
as far from Remorse, or looking on it as a Judgment; I only said to
myself often, that I was an unfortunate Dog, and born to be always
miserable.
It is true, when I got on Shore first here, and found all my Ship's
Crew drowned, and myself spared, I was surpris'd with a Kind of
Ecstasy, and some Transports of Soul, which, had the Grace of God
assisted, might have come up to true Thankfulness; but it ended
where it begun, in a mere common Flight of Joy, or as I may say,
being glad I was alive, without the least Reflection upon the dis-
tinguishing Goodness of the Hand which had preserv'd me, and
had singled me out to be preserv'd, when all the rest were destroy'd;
or an Inquiry why Providence had been thus merciful to me; even
just the same common Sort of Joy which Seamen generally have after
they are got safe ashore from a Shipwreck, which they drown all in
the next Bowl of Punch, and forget almost as soon as it is over, and
all the rest of my Life was like it
Even when I was afterwards, on due Consideration, made sensible
of my Condition, how I was cast on this dreadful Place, out of the
Reach of human Kind, out of all Hope of Relief, or Prospect of
Redemption, as soon as I saw but a Prospect of living, and that I
should not starve and perish for Hunger, all the Sense of my Afflic-
tion wore off, and I begun to be very easy, applied myself to the
Works proper for my Preservation and Supply, and was far enough
from being afflicted at my Condition, as a Judgment from Heaven,
or as the Hand of God against me; these were Thoughts which very
seldom enter'd into my Head.
The growing up of the Corn, as is hinted in my Journal, had at
first some little Influence upon me, and began to affect me with
Seriousness, as long as I thought it had something miraculous in it;
but as soon as ever that Fart of the Thought was remov'd, all the Inv
pression which was raised from it, wore off also, as I have noted
already.
Even the Earthquake, though nothing could be more terrible in its
Nature, or more immediately directing to the invisible Power which
alone directs such Things, yet no sooner was the first Fright over, but
the Impression it had made went off also. I had no more Sense of
God or his Judgments, much less of the present Affliction of my
Circumstances being from his Hand, than if I had been in the most
prosperous Condition of Life.
But now when I began to be sick, and a leisurely View of the
Miseries of Death came to place itself before me; when my Spirits
began to sink under the Burden of a strong Distemper, and Nature
was exhausted with the Violence of the Fever; Conscience that had
slept so long, begun to awake, and I began to reproach myself with
my past Life, in which I had so evidently, by uncommon Wickedness,
provok'd the Justice of God to lay me under uncommon Strokes, and
to deal with me in so vindictive a Manner.
These Reflections oppress'd me for the second or third Day of my
Distemper, and in the Violence, as well of the Fever, as of the
dreadful Reproaches of my Conscience, extorted some Words from
me, like praying to God, though I cannot say they were either a
Prayer attended with Desires or with Hopes; it was rather the Voice
of mere Fright and Distress; my Thoughts were confus'd, the Con-
victions grew upon my Mind, and the Horror of dying in such a
miserable Condition raised Vapours into my Head with the mere
Apprehensions; and in these Hurries of my Soul, I know not what
my Tongue might express; but it was rather Exclamation, such as,
Lord! what a miserable Creature am I? If I should be sick, I shall
certainly die for Want of Help, and what will become of me 1 Then
the Tears burst out of my Eyes, and I could say no more for a
good while.
In this Interval, the good Advice of my Father came to my Mind,
and presently his Prediction which I mention'd at the Beginning of
this Story, viz. That if I did take this foolish Step, God would not
bless me, and I would hax t Leisure hereafter to reflect upon having neg-
lected his Counsel, when there might be none to assist in my Recovery.
Now, said I aloud, My dear Father's Words are come to pass: God'i
Justice has overtaken me, and I have none to help or hear me: I
rejected the Voice of Providence, which had mercifully put me in a
Posture or Station of Life, wherein I might have been happy and
easy; but I would neither see it myself, or learn to know the Blessing
of it from my Parents; I left them to mourn over my Folly, and now
I am left to mour n under the Consequences of it: I refus'd their
Help and Assistance who would have lifted me into the World, and
would have made everything easy to me, and now I have Difficulties
to struggle with, too great for even Nature itself to support, and no
Assistance, no Help, no Comfort, no Advice; then I cried out,
Lord be my Help, for I am in great Distress.
This was the first Prayer, if I may call it so, that I had made for
many Years: But I return to my Journal.
June 28. Having been somewhat refresh'd with the Sleep I had
had, and the Fit being entirely off, I got up; and though the Fright
and Terror of my Dream was very great, yet I consider'd, that the
Fit of the Ague would return again the next Day, and now was my
Time to get something to refresh and support myself when I should
be ill; and the first Thing I did, I filled a large square Case Bottle
with Water, and set it upon my Table, in Reach of my Bed; and to
take off the chill or aguish Disposition of the Water, I put about a
Quarter of a Pint of Rum into it, and mixed them together; and then
I got me a Piece of the Goat's Flesh, and broiled it on the Coals, but
could eat very little; I walked about, but was very weak, and withal
very sad and heavy-hearted in the Sense of my miserable Condition;
dreading the Return of my Distemper the next Day; at Night I made
my Supper of three of the Turtle's Eggs, which I roasted in the Ashes,
and eat, as we call it, in the Shell; and this was the first Bit of Meat I
had ever asked God's Blessing to, even as I could remember, in my
whole Life.
After I had eater, I tried to walk, but found myself so weak, that I
could hardly carry the Gun, (for I never went out without that) so I
went but a little Way, and sat down upon the Ground, looking out
upon the Sea, which was just before me, and very calm and smooth:
As I sat here, some such Thoughts as these occurred to me.
What is this Earth and Sea of which I have seen so much, whence
is it produc'd, and what am I, and all the other Creatures, wild and
tame, human and brutal, whence are we?
Sure we are all made by some secret Power, who formed the Earth
and Sea, the Air and Sky; and who is that?
Then it follow'd most naturally, It is God that has made it all:
Well, but then it came on strangely, if God has made all these Things,
He guides and governs them all, and all Things that concern them;
for the Power that could make all Things, must certainly have Power
to guide and direct them.
If so, nothing can happen in the great Circuit of his Works,
either without his Knowledge or Appointment
And if nothing happens without his Knowledge, he knows that I
am here, and am in this dreadful Condition; and if nothing happens
without his Appointment, he has appointed all this to befal me.
Nothing occurr'd to my Thought to contradict any of these Con-
clusions; and therefore it rested upon me with the greater Force,
that it must needs be, that God had appointed all this to befal me;
that I was brought to this miserable Circumstance by his Direction,
he having the sole Power, not of me only, but of everything that
happen'd in the World. Immediately it follow'd,
Why has God done this to me? What have I done to be thus used 1
My Conscience presently checked me in that Inquiry, as if I had blas-
phem'd, and methought it spoke to me like a Voice; WRETCH I
dost thou ask what thou hast doneI look back upon a dreadful mis-
spent Life, and ask thyself what thou hast not done? ask, Why is it
that thou wert not long ago destroy'dl Why wert thou not drowned in
Yarmouth Roads? Killed in the Fight when the Ship was taken by the
Sallee Man of War? Devour'd by the wild Beasts on the Coast of
Africa? Or, Drowned HERE, when all the Crew perished but thyself?
Dost thou ask, What have 1done?
I was struck dumb with these Reflections, as one astonish'd, and
had not a Word to say, no not to answer to myself, but rose up pen-
sive and sad, walked back to my Retreat, and went up over my Wall,
as if I had been going to Bed, but my Thoughts were sadly dis-
turb'd, and I had no Inclination to Sleep; so I sat down in my
Chair, and lighted my Lamp, for it began to be dark: Now as the
Apprehension of the Return of my Distemper terrify'd me very much,
it occurr'd to my Thought, that the Brasilians take no Physic but
their Tobacco, for almost all Distempers; and I had a Piece of a
Roll of Tobacco in one of the Chests, which was quite cured, and
some also that was green and not quite cured.
I went, directed by Heaven no doubt; for in this Chest I found a
Cure, both for Soul and Body, I open'd the Chest,(and found what I
looked for, via. the Tobacco; and as the few Books I had saved, \ay
there too, I took out one of the Bibles which I mention'd before, and
which to this Time I had not found Leisure, or so much as Inclina-
tion to look into; I say, I took it out, and brought both that and the
Tobacco with me to the Table.
What Use to make of the Tobacco, I knew not, as to my Distem-
per, or whether it was good for it or no; but I tried several Experi-
ments with it, as if I was resolv'd it should hit one Way or other:
I first took a Piece of a Leaf, and chewed it in my Mouth, which
indeed at first almost stupified my Brain, the Tobacco being
green and strong, and that I had not been much used to it; then I
took some and steeped it an Hour or two in some Rum, and resolv'd
to take a Dose of it when I lay down; and lastly, I burnt some
upon a Pan of Coals, and held my Nose close over the Smoke of it as
long as I could bear it, as well for the Heat as almost for Suffocation.
In the Interval of this Operation, I took up the Bible and began
to read, but my Head was too much disturb'd with the Tobacco to
bear reading, at least that Time; only having open'd the Book
casually, the first Words that occurr'd to me were these, Call on ml
ix the Day of Trouble, and I will deliver, and thou shalt glorify me.
The Words were very apt to my Case, and made some Impression
upon my Thoughts at the Time of reading them, though not so much
as they did afterwards; for as for being deliver'd, the Word had no
Sound, as I may say, to me; the Thing was so remote, so impos-
sible in my Apprehension of Things, that I began to say as the Chil-
dren of Israel did, when they were promis'd Flesh to eat, Can God
tpread a Table in the Wilderness? so I began to say, can God himself
deliver me from this Place? and as it was not for many Years that
any Hope appear'd, this prevail'd very often upon my Thoughts : But
however, the Words made a great Impression upon me, and I mused
upon them very often. It grew now late, and the Tobacco had, as I
said, dosed my Head so much, that I inclin'd to sleep; so I left my
Lamp burning in the Cave, lest I should want anything in the
Night, and went to Bed; but before I lay down, I did what I never
had done in all my Life, I kneeled down and prayed to God to fulfil
the Promise to me, that if I called upon him in the Day of Trouble,
he would deliver me; after my broken and imperfect Prayer was
over, I drunk the Rum in which I had steeped the Tobacco, which
was so strong and rank of the Tobacco, that indeed I could scarce
get it down; immediately upon this I went to Bed. I found
presently it flew up in my Head violently, but I fell into a sound
Sleep, and waked no more 'till by the Sun it must necessarily be near
Three o'Clock in the Afternoon the next Day; nay, to this Hour I am
partly of the Opinion, that I slept all the next Day and Night, and
till almost Three that Day after; for otherwise I knew not how I
should lose a Day out of my Reckoning in the Days of the Week,
as it appear'd some Years after I had done; for if I had lost it by
crossing and recrossing the Line, I should have lost more than one
Day: But certainly I lost a Day in my Account, and never knew
which Way.
Be that however one Way or the other, when I awak'd I found my-
self exceedingly refresh'd, and my Spirits lively and cheerful; when
I got up, I was stronger than I was the Day before, and my
Stomach better, for I was hungry; and in short, I had no Fit the
next Day, but continu'd much alter'd for the better; this was the 29th.
The 30th was my well-Day of Course, and I went abroad with my
Gun, but did not care to travel too far, I killed a Sea Fowl or two,
something like a brand Goose, and brought them Home, but was
not very forward to eat them: so I ate some more of the Turtle's
Eggs, which were very good: This Evening I renew'd the Medicine
which I had suppos'd did me good the Day before, viz. the Tobacco
steeped in Rum, only I did not take so much as before, nor did I
chew any of the Leaf, or hold my Head over the Smoke; however,
I was not so well the next Day, which was the first of July, as I hoped
I should have been; for I had a little Spice of the cold Fit, but it
was not much.
July 2. I renew'd the Medicine all the three Ways, and dosed
myself with it as at first; and doubled the Quantity which I drank.
3. I missed the Fit for good and all, though [ did not recover my
full Strength for some Weeks after; while I was thus gathering
Strength, my Thoughts run exceedingly upon this Scripture, / will
deliver thee, and the Impossibility of my Deliverance lay much upon my
Mind in Bar of my ever expecting it: But as I was discouraging myself
with such Thoughts, it occurr'd to my Mind, that I pored so much
upon my Deliverance from the main Affliction, that I disregarded
the Deliverance I had receiv'd; and I was, as it were, made to
ask myself such Questions as these, viz. Have I not been deliver'd,
and wonderfully too, from Sickness? from the most distress'd Con-
dition that could be-, and that was so frightful to me. and what
ClilS'iE KFAUINU THIS SCKHTURES.—P. 85.
Notice I had taken of it: Had I done my Part, God had deliver'd me,
kut I had not glorify d him; that is to say, I had not owned and been
thankful for that as a Deliverance, and how could I expect greater
Deliverance.
This touched my Heart very much, and immediately I kneeled
down and gave God Thanks aloud, for my Recovery from my Sick
ness.
July 4. In the Morning I took the Bible, and beginning at the New
Testament, I began seriously to read it, and impos'd upon myself
to read a while every Morning and every Night, not tying myself to
the Number of Chapters, but as long as my Thoughts should engage
me: It was not long after I set seriously to this Work, but I found
my Heart more deeply and sincerely affected with the Wickedness of
my past Life: The Impression of my Dream reviv'd, and the Words,
All these Things have not brought thee to Repentance, ran seriously in my
Thought: I was earnestly begging of God to giv.e me Repentance,
when it happen'd providentially the very Day that reading the
Scripture, I came to these Words, He is exalted a Prince and a Saviour,
to give Repentance, and to give Remission: I threw down the Book, and
with my Heart as well as my Hands lifted to Heaven, in a Kind ol
Ecstasy of Joy, I cried out aloud, Jesus, thou Son of David, Jesus,
thou exalted Prince and Saviour, give me Repentance I
This was the first Time that I could say, in the true Sense of the
Words, that I prayed in all my Life; for now I prayed with a Sense
of my Condition, and with a true Scripture View of Hope founded
on the Encouragement of the Word of God; and from this Time,
I may say, I began to have Hope that God would hear me.
Now I began to construe the Words mentioned above, Call on me,
and I will deliver you, in a different Sense from what I had ever done
before; for then I had no Notion of anything being called Deliver-
ance, but my being deliver'd from the Captivity I was in; for though
I was indeed at large in the Place, yet the Island was certainly a
Prison to me, and that in the worst Sense in the World; but now 1
learned to take it in another Sense: Now I looked back upon my
past Life with such Horror, and my Sins appear'd so dreadful, that
my Soul sought nothing of God, but Deliverance from the Load of Guilt
that bore down all my Comfort: As for my solitary Life it was no-
thing; I did not so much as pray to be deliver'd from it, or think of
it; It was all of no Consideration in Comparison to this: And I add
this Part here, to hint to whoever shall read it, that whenever they
come to a true Sense of things, they will find Deliverance from Sin a
much greater Blessing, than Deliverance from Affliction.
But leaving this Part, I return to my Journal
My Condition began now to be, though not less miserable as to my
Way of living, yet much easier to my Mind; fend my Thoughts being
directed, by a constant reading the Scripture, and praying to God,
to things of a higher Nature: I had a great deal of Comfort within,
which till now I knew nothing of; also, as my Health and Strength
returned, I bestirr'd myself to furnish myself with everything that I
wanted, and make my Way of living as regular as I could.
From the 4th of July to the 14th, I was chiefly employ'd in walk-
ing about with my Gun in my Hand, a little and a little, at a Time,
as a Man that was gathering up his Strength after a Fit of Sickness:
For it is hardly to be imagin'd, how low I was, and to what Weak-
ness I was reduc'd. The Application which I made Use of was per-
fectly new, and perhaps what had never cured an Ague before, neither
can I recommend it to anyone to practise, by this Experiment; and
though it did carry off the Fit, yet it rather contributed to weakening
me; for I had frequent Convulsions in my Nerves and Limbs for
some Time.
I learnt from it also this in particular, that being abroad in the
rainy Season was the most pernicious thing to my Health that could be,
especially in those Rains which came attended with Storms and
Hurricanes of Wind; for as the Rain which came in the dry Season
was always most accompany'd with such Storms, so I found that
Rain was much more dangerous than the Rain which fell in Septem-
ber and October.
I had been now in this unhappy Island above 10 Months, all
Possibility of Deliverance from this Condition, seemed to be entirely
taken from me ; and I firmly believed, that no human Shape had ever
set Foot upon that Place: Having now secur'd my Habitation, as I
thought, fully to my Mind, I had a great Desire to make a va.au
perfect Discovery of the Island, and to see what other Productions I
might find, which I yet knew nothing of.
It was the 15th of July that I began to take a more particular
Survey of the Island itself: I went up the Creek first, where, as I
hinted, I brought my Rafts on Shore; I found after I came about
two Miles up, that the Tide did not flow any higher, and that it was
no more than a little Brook of running Water, and ver> fresh and
good; but this being the dry Season, there was hardly any Water in
some Parts of it, at least, not enough to run in any Stream, so as it
could be perceiv'd.
On the Bank of this Brook I found may pleasant Savartas, or
Meadows; plain, smooth, and cover'd with Grass; and on the rising
Parts of them next to the higher Grounds, where the Water, as it
might be supposed, never overflow'd, I found a great deal of Tobacco,
green, and growing to a great and very strong Stalk; there were
divers other Plants which I had no Notion of, or Understanding
about, and might perhaps have Virtues of their own, which I could
not find out
I searched for the Cassava Root, which the Indians in all that
Climate make their Bread of, but I could find none. I saw large
Plants of Aloes, but did not then understand them. I saw several
Sugar Canes, but wild, and for want of Cultivation, imperfect I con-
tented myself with these Discoveries for this Time, and came back
musing with myself what Course I might take to know the Virtue and
Goodness of any of the Fruits or Plants which I should discover; but
could bring it to no Conclusion; for in short, I had made so little
Observation while I was in the Brasils, that I knew little of the
Plants in the Field, at least very little that might serve me to any
Purpose now in my Distress.
The next Day, the 16th, I went up the same Way again, and after
going something farther than I had gone the Day before, I found the
Brook, and the Savanas began to cease, and the Country became
more woody than before; in this Part I found different Fruits, and
particularly I found Melons upon the Ground in great Abundance,
and Grapes upon the Trees; the Vines had spread indeed over the
Trees, and the Clusters of Grapes were just now in their Prime, very
ripe and rich: This was a surprising Discovery, and I was exceeding
glad of them; but I was warned by my Experience to eat sparingly
of them, remembering that when I was ashore in Barbary, the eating
of Grapes killed several of our English Men who were Slaves there,
by throwing them into Fluxes and Fevers: But I found an excellent
Use for these Grapes, and that was to cure or dry them in the Sun,
and keep them as dried Grapes or Raisins are kept, which I thought
would be, as indeed they were, as wholesome as agreeable to eat
when no Grapes might be to be had.
I spent all that Evening there, and went not back to my Habita-
tion, which by the Way was the first Night, as I might say, I had lain
from Home. In the Night I took my first Contrivance, and got up
into a Tree, where I slept
well, and the next Morning
proceeded upon my Discovery,
travelling near four Miles, am
I might judge by the Length
of the Valley, keeping still due
North, with a Ridge of Hills
on the South and North side
of ine.
At the End of this March 1
came to an Opening, where
the Country seemed to de-
scend to the West, and a
little Spring of fresh Water,
which issued out of the Side
of the Hill by me, run the
other Way, that is due East;
and the Country appear'd so
fresh, so green, so flourishing,
everything being in a con-
stant Verdure, or Flourish ol
Spring, that it looked like a
planted Garden.
I descended a little on the
Side of that delicious Vale,
surveying it with a secret
Kind of Pleasure, (though
mixed with my other afflicting
Thoughts) to think that this
was all my own, that I was
King and Lord of all this
Country indefeasibly, and had
» Right of Possession; and if I could convey it, I might have it in
Inheritance, as completely as any Lord of a Manor in England. I saw
here Abundance of Cocoa Trees, Orange, and Lemon, and Citron
Trees; but all wild and very few bearing any Fruit, at least not then:

However, the green Limes that I gathered, were not only pleasant
to eat, but very wholesome ; and I mixed their Juice afterwards with
Water, which made it very wholesome, and very cool, and re-
freshing.
I found now I had Business enough to gather and carry Home;
and I resolv'd to lay up a Store, as well of Grapes, as Limes and
Lemons, to furnish myself for the wet Season, which I knew was ap-
proaching.
In Order to this, I gather'd a great Heap of Grapes in one Place,
and a lesser Heap in another Place, and a great Parcel of Limes and
Lemons in another Place; and taking a few of each with me, I
travell'd homeward, and resolv'd to come again, and bring a Bag or
Sack, or what I could make to carry the rest Home.
Accordingly, having spent three Days in this Journey, I came
Home; so I must now call my Tent and my Cave: But, before I got
thither, the Grapes were spoiled, the Richness of the Fruits, and the
Weight of the Juice having broken them, and bruised them, they
were good for little or nothing; as to the Limes, they were good, but
I could bring but a few.
The next Day, being the 19th, I went back, having made me two
small Bags to bring Home my Harvest: But I was surpris'd, when
coming to my Heap of Grapes, which were so rich and fine when I
gather'd them, I found them all spread about, trod to Pieces; and
dragged about, some here, some there, and Abundance eaten and
devour'd: By this I concluded, there were some wild Creatures there-
abouts, which had done this; but what they were, I knew not
However, as I found there was no laying them up on Heaps,
and no carrying them away in a Sack, but that one Way they would
be desrroy'd, and the other Way they would be crushed with their
own Weight, I took another Course; for I gather'd a large Quantity
of the Grapes, and hung them up upon the out Branches of the Trees,
that they might cure and dry in the Sun; and as for the Limes and
Lemons, I carried as many back as I could well stand under.
When I came Home from this Journey, I contemplated with great
Pleasure the Fruitfulness of that Valley, and the Pleasantness of the
Situation, the Security from Storms on that Side the Water, and the
Wood, and concluded, that I had pitched upon a Place to fix my
Abode, which was by far the worst Part of the Country. Upon the
Whole I began to consider of removing my Habitation; and to look
out for a Place equally safe, as where I now was situate, if possible, in
that pleasant fruitful Part of the Island.
This Thought run long in my Head, and I was exceeding fond of
it for some Time, the Pleasantness of the Place tempting me; but
when I came to a nearer View of it, and to consider that I was now
by the Sea-Side, where it was at least possible that something might
happen to my Advantage, and by the same ill Fate that brought me
hither, might bring some other unhappy Wretches to the same Place;
and though it was scarce probable that any such Thing should ever
happen, yet to enclose myself among the Hills and Woods, in the
Centre of the Island, was to anticipate my Bondage, and to render
such an Affair not only Improbable, but Impossible; and that there-
fore I ought not by any Means to remove.
However, I was so Enamour'd of this Place, that I spent much of
my Time there, for the whole remaining Part of the Month of July;
and though upon second Thoughts I resolv'd as above, not to remove,
yet I built me a little kind of a Bower, and surrounded it at a Distance
with a strong Fence, being a double Hedge, as high as I could reach,
well staked, and filled between with Brushwood; and here I lay very
secure, sometimes two or three Nights together, always going over it
with a Ladder, as before; so that I fancied now I had my Country
House, and my Sea-Coast House: And this Work took me up to the
Beginning of August.
I had but newly finish'd my Fence, and began to enjoy my Labour,
but the Rains came on, and made me stick close to my first Habita-
tion ; for though I had made me a Tent like the other, with a Piece of
a Sail, and spread it very well; yet I had not the Shelter of a Hill to
keep me from Storms, nor a Cave behind me to retreat into, when
the Rains were extraordinary.
About the Beginning of August, as I said, I had finish'd my Bower,
and began to enjcy myself. The third of August, I found the Grapes
I had hung up were perfectly dried, and indeed, were excellent good
Raisins of the Sun; so I began to take them down from the Trees, and
it was very happy that I did so; for the Rains which follow'd would
have spoiled them, and I had lost the best Part of my Winter Food;
for I had above two hundred large Bunches of them. No sooner had
I taken them all down, and carried most of them Home to my Cave,
but it began to rain, and from hence, which was the fourteenth of
August, it rained more or less, every Day, till the middle of October;
9«
and sometimes so violently, that I could not stir out of my cave for
several Days.
In this Season I was much surpris'd with the Increase of my
Family; I had been concern'd for the Loss of one of my Cats, who
run away from me, or as I thought had been dead, and I heard no
more Tale or Tidings of her, till to my Astonishment she came
Home about the End of August, with three Kittens; this was the
more strange to ma, because though I had killed a wild Cat, as I
called it, with my Gun; yet I thought it was a quite differing Kind
from our European Cats; yet the voung Cats were the same Kind of

House breed like the old one; and both my Cats being Females, I
thought it very strange: But from these three Cats, I afterwards came
to be so pester'd with Cats, that I was forced to kill them like Vermin,
or wild Beasts, and to drive them from my House as much as
possible.
From the fourteenth of August to the twenty-sixth, incessant Rain,
to that I could not stir, and was now very careful not to be much
wet In this Confinement I began to be straitened for Food,
but venturing out twice, I one Day killed a Goat, and the last Day,
which was the twenty-^ixth, found a very large Tortoise, which was a
Treat to me, and my Food was regulated thus; I eat a Bunch of
Raisins for my Breakfast, a Piece of the Goat's Flesh, or of the Turtle
for my Dinner broiled; for to mygreat Misfortune, I had no Vessel to boil
or stew anything; and two or three of the Turtle's Eggs for my Supper.
During this Confinement in my Cover, by the Rain, I worked daily
two or three Hours at enlarging my Cave, and by Degrees worked it
on towards one Side, till I came to the Outside of the Hill, and made
a Door or Way out, which came beyond my Fence or Wall, and so I
came in and out this Way; but I was not perfectly easy at lying so
open; for as I had managed myself before, I was in a perfect Enclo-
sure, whereas now I thought I lay expos'd, and open for anything to
come in upon me; and yet I could not perceive that there was any
living Thing to fear, the biggest Creature that I had yet seen upon
the Island being a Goat
September the thirtieth, I was now come to the unhappy Anniver-
sary of my Landing. I cast up the Notches on my Post, and found
I had been on Shore three hundred and sixty-five Days. I kept this
Day as a Solemn Fast, setting it apart to Religious Exercise, prostrat-
ing myself on the Ground with the most serious Humiliation, confess*
ing my Sins to God, acknowledging his Righteous Judgments upon me,
and praying to him to have Mercy on me, through Jesus Christ; and
having not tasted the least Refreshment for twelve Hours, even till
the going down of the Sun, I then eat a Biscuit Cake, and a Bunch
of Grapes, and went to Bed, finishing the Day as I began it
I had all this Time observ'd no Sabbath-Day; for as at first I had
no Sense of Religion upon my Mind, I had after some Time omitted
to distinguish the Weeks, by making a longer Notch than ordinary
for the Sabbath-Day, and so did not really know what any of the Days
were; but now having cast up the Days, as above, I found I had
been there a Year; so I divided it into Weeks, and set apart every
seventh Day for a Sabbath; though I found at the End of my Ac-
count I had lost a Day or two in my Reckoning.
A little after this my Ink began to fail me, and so I contented my-
self to use it more sparingly, and to write down only the most re-
markable Events of my Life, without continuing a daily Memorandum
of other Things.
The rainy Season, and the dry Season, began now to appear regu-
lar to me, and I learnt to divide them so, as to provide for them ac-
cordingly. But I bought all my Experience before I had it; and
this I am going to relate, was one of the most discouraging Experi-
ments that I made at all: I have mention'd that I had saved the few
Ears of Barley and Rice, which I had so surprisingly found spring up,
as I thought, of themselves, and believe there were about thirty Stalks
of Rice, and about twenty of Barley; and now I thought it a proper
Time to sow it after the Rains, the Sun being in its Southern Position
going from me.
Accordingly I dug up a Piece of Ground as well as I could with
my wooden Spade, and dividing it into two Parts, I sowed my Grain;
but as I was sowing, it casually occurr'd to my Thoughts, That I
would not sow it all at first, because I did not know when was the
proper Time for it; so I sowed about two Thirds of the Seed, leaving
about a Handful of each.
It was a great Comfort to me afterwards, that I did so, for not one
Grain of that sowed this Time came to anything; for the dry Months
following, the Earth having had no Rain after the Seed was sown, it
had no Moisture to assist its Growth, and never came up at all, till
the wet Season had come again, and then it grew as if it had been
but newly sown.
Finding my first Seed did not grow, which I easily imagin'd was by
the Drought, I sought for a moister Piece of Ground to make
another Trial in, and I dug up a Piece of Ground near my new Bower,
and sowed the rest of my Seed in February, a little before the Vernal
Equinox; and this having the rainy Months of March and April to
water it, sprung up very pleasantly, and yielded a very good Crop;
but having Part of the Seed left only, and not daring to sow all that I
had, I had but a small Quantity at last, my whole Crop not amounting
to above half a Peck of each kind.
But by this Experiment I was made Master of my Business, and
knew exactly when the proper Season was to sow; and that I might
expect two Seed Times, and two Harvests every Year.
While this Cor n was growing, I made a little Discovery which was
of use to me afterwards: As soon as the Rains were over, and the
Weather began to settle, which was about the Month of November, I
made a Visit up the Country to my Bower, where though 1 had not
been some Months, yet I found all Things just as I left them. The
Circle or double Hedge that I had made, was not only firm and en-
tire; but the Stakes which I had cut out of some Trees that grew
{hereabouts, were all shot out and grown with long Branches, as much
as a Willow-Tree usually shoots the first Year after lopping its Head
I could not tell what Tree to call it, that these Stakes were cut from.
I was surpris'd, and yet very well pleased, to see the young Trees grow;
and I pruned them, and led them up to grow as much alike as I
could; and it is scarce credible how beautiful a Figure they grew into
in three Years; so that though the Hedge made a Circle of about
twenty-five Yards in Diameter, yet the Trees, for such I might now
call them, soon cover'd it; and it was a complete Shade, sufficient
'jo lodge under all the dry Season.
This made me resolve to cut some more Stakes, and make me a
Hedge like this in a Semicircle round my Wall; I mean that of my
first Dwelling, which I did; and placing the Trees or Stakes in a
double Row, at about eight Yards' distance from my first Fence, they
grew presently, and were at first a fine Cover to my Habitation, and
afterward served for a Defence also, as I shall observe in its Order.
I found now, That the Seasons of the Year might generally be
divided, not into Summer and Winter, as in Europe; but into the
Rainy Seasons, and the Dry Seasons, which were generally thus,
Half February, \

The Rainy Season sometimes held longer or shorter, as the Winds
happen'd to blow; but this was the general Observation I made: After
I had found by Experience, the ill Consequence of being abroad in
the Rain, I took Care to furnish myself with Provisions beforehand,
Dry, the Sun being then in the South of the Line.
95
that I might not be oblig'd to go out; and I sat within Doors as
much as possible during the wet Months.
In this Time I found much Employment, (and very suitable also
to the Time) for I found great Occasion of many Things which I had
no way to furnish myself with, but by hard Labour and constant
Application; particularly, I tried many Ways to make myself
a Basket, but all the Twigs I could get for the Purpose proved so
brittle, that they would do nothing. It proved of excellent Advan-
tage to me now, That when I was a Boy, I used to take great Delight
in standing at a Basket-maker's, in the Town where my Father lived,
to see them make their Wicker-ware; and being as Boys usually are,

very officious to help, and a great Observer of the Manner how they
worked those Things, and sometimes lending a Hand, I had by this
Means full Knowledge of the Methods of it, that I wanted nothing
but the Materials; when it came into my Mind, That the Twigs of
that Tree from whence I cut my Stakes that grew, might possibly be
as tough as the Sallows, and Willows, and Osiers in England, and I
resolv'd to try.
Accordingly the next Day, I went to my Country-House, as I callo*
it, and cutting some of the smaller Twigs, I found them to my Put
pose as much as I could desire; whereupon I came the next Time
prepar'd with a Hatchet to cut down a Quantity, which I soon found.
for there was great Plenty of them; these I set up to dry within my
Circle or Hedge, and when they were fit for Use, I carried them to
my Cave, and here during the next Season, I employed myself in
making, as well as I could, a great may Baskets, both to carry Earth,
or to carry or lay up anything as I had occasion; and though I did
not finish them very handsomely, yet I made them sufficiently ser-
viceable for my Purpose; and thus afterwards I took Care never to
be without them; and as my Wicker-ware decay'd, I made more,
especially, I made strong deep Baskets to place my Corn in, instead
of Sacks, when I should come to have any Quantity of it
Having master'd this Difficulty, and employ'd a World of Time
about it, I bestirr'd myself to see if possible how to supply two Wants':
I had no Vessels to hold anything (hat was Liquid, except two Run-
lets which were almost full of Rum, and some Glass-Bottles, some of
the common Size, and others which were Case-Bottles-Square, for the
holding of Waters, Spirits, &*c. I had not so much as a Pot to boil
anything, except a great Kettle, which I saved out of the Ship,
and which was too big for such Use as I desir'd, viz. To make Broth,
and stew a Bit of Meat by itself. The Second Thing I would fain
have had was a Tobacco-Pipe; but it was impossible to me to make
one, however, I found a Contrivance for that too at last
I employ'd myself in Planting my Second Rows of Stakes or Piles
and in this Wicker working all the Summer, or dry Season, when
another Business took me up more Time than it could be imagin'd I
could spare.
I mention'd before, That I had a great Mind to see the whole
Island, and that I had travell'd up the Brook, and so on to where I
built my Bower, and where I had an Opening quite to the Sea on the
other Side of the Island; I now resolv'd to travel quite Cross to the
Sea-Shore on that Side; so taking my Gun, a Hatchet, and my Dog,
and a larger Quantity of Powder and Shot than usual, with two Bis-
cuit Cakes, and a great Bunch of Raisins in my Pouch for my Store, I
began my Journey; when I had passed the Vale where my Bower stood
as above, I came within View of the Sea, to the West, and it being a
very clear Day, I fairly descry'd Land, whether an Island or a Con-
tinent, I could not tell; but it lay very high, extending from the West,
to the W.S. W. at a very great Distance; by my Guess it could not be
less than Fifteen or Twenty Leagues off.
I could not tell what Part of the World this might be, otherwise
97
than that I know it must be Part of America, and as I concluded by all
my Observations, must be near the Spanish Dominions, and peihaps
was all Inhabited by Savages, where if I should have landed, I had
been in a worse Condition than I was now; and therefore I acqui-
esced in the Dispositions of Providence, which I began now to own,
and to believe, order'd everything for the best; I say, I quieted my
Mind with this, and left afflicting myself with Fruitless Wishes of be-
ing there.
Besides, after some Pause upon this Affair, I consider'd, that if this
Land was the Spanish Coast, I should certainly, one Time or other,
see some Vessel pass or re-pass one Way or other; but if not, then
it was the Savage Coast between the Spanish Country and Brasils
which are indeed the worst of Savages; for they are Cannibals, or
Men-eaters, and fail not to murder and devour all the human Bodies
that fall into their Hands.
With these Considerations I walked very leisurely forward, I
found that Side of the Island where I now was, much plcasanter
than mine, the open or Savana Fields sweet, adorn'd with Flowers
and Grass, and full of very fine Woods. I saw Abundance of Parrots,
and fain I would have caught one, if possible to have kept it to be
tame, and taught it to speak to me. I did, after some Painstaking,
catch a young Parrot, for I knocked it down with a Stick, and having
recover^ it, I brought it home; but it was some Years before I could
make him speak: However, at last I taught him to call me by my
Name very familiarly: But the Accident that follow'd, though it be a
Trifle, will be very diverting in its Place.
I was exceedingly diverted with this Journey: I found in the low
Grounds Hares, as I thought them to be, and Foxes, but they dif-
fer'd greatly from all the other Kinds I had met with; nor could I
satisfy myself to eat them, though I killed several: But I had no Need
to be venturous; for I had no Want of Food, and of that which was
very good too; especially these three Sorts, viz. Goats, Pigeons, and
Turtle or Tortoise; which, added to my Grapes, Leaden-hall Market
could not have furnish'd a Table better than I, in Proportion to the
Company; and though my Case was deplorable enough, yet I had
great Cause for Thankfulness, and that I was not driven to any
Extremities for Food; but rather Plenty, even to Dainties.
I never travell'd in this Journey above two Miles outright in a Day,
or thereabouts: but I took so many Turns and Returns, to see what
Discoveries I could make, that I came weary enough to the Place
where I resolv'd to sit down for all Night; and then I either repos'd
myself in a Tree, or surrounded myself with a Row of Stakes set upright
in the Ground, either from one Tree to another, or so as no wild
Creature could come at me, without waking me.
As soon as I came to the Sea Shore, I was surpris'd to see that I
had taken up my Lot on the worst Side of the Island; for here
indeed the Shore was cover^ with innumerable Turtles, whereas on
the other Side I had found but three in a Year and half. Here was
also an infinite Number of Fowls, of many Kinds, some which I had
seen, and some which I had not seen of before, and many of them
very good Meat; But such as I knew not the Names of, except
those called Penguins.
I could have shot as many as I pleased, but was very sparing of
my Powder and Shot; and therefore had more Mind to kill a she-
Goat, if I could, which I could better feed on; and though there
were many Goats here more than on my Side the Island, yet it was
with much more Difficulty that I could come near them, the Country
being flat and even, and they saw me much sooner than when I was
on the Hill.
I confess this Side of the Country was much pleasanter than mine,
but yet I had not the least Inclination to remove; for as I was fixed
in my Habitation, it became natural to me, and I seemed all the
while I was here, to be as it were upon a Journey, and from Home:
However, I travell'd along the Shore of the Sea, towards the East,
I suppose about twelve Miles; and then setting up a great Pole upon
the Shore for a Mark, I concluded I would go Home again; and
that the next Journey I took should be on the other Side of the
Island, East from my Dwelling, and so round till I came to my Tost
again: Of which in its Place.
I took another Way to come back than that I went, thinking I
could easily keep all the Island so much in my View, that I could not
miss finding my first Dwelling by viewing the Country; but I found
myself mistaken; for being come about two or three Miles, I found
myself descended into a very large Valley; but so surrounded with
Hills, and those Hills cover'd with Wood, that I could not see which
was my Way by any Direction but that of the Sun, nor even then,
unless I knew very well the Position of the Sun at that Time oi th«
Day.
99
It happen'd to my farther Misfortune, That the WeatnO- proved
hazy for three or four Days, while I was in this Valley; and not be-
ing able to see the Sun, I wander'd about very uncomfortably, and
at last was oblig'd to find out the Sea Side, look for my Post, and
come back the same Way I went; and then by easy Journeys I
turned Homeward, the Weather being exceeding hot, and my Gun,
Ammunition, Hatchet, and other Things very heavy.
In this Journey my Dog surpris'd a Young Kid, and seized upon it,
and I running in to take hold of it, caught it and saved it alive from the
Dog: I had a great Mind to bring it Home if I could; for I had
often been musing, Whether it might not be possible to get a Kid or
two, and so raise a Breed of tame Goats, which might supply me
when my Powder and Shot should be all spent
I made a Collar to this little Creature, and with a String which I
had of some Rope-Yarn, which I always carried about with me, I led

hhn aiong, though with some Difficulty, till I came to my Bower, anu
there I enclos'd him, and left him; for I was very impatient to be at
Home, from whence I had been absent above a Month.
I cannot express what a Satisfaction it was to me, to come into my
old Hutch, and lie down in my Hammock-Bed: This little wandering
Journey, without settled Place of Abode, had been so unpleasant to
me, that my own House, as I called it to mvself, was a perfect
Settlement to me, compar'd to that; and it rendered everything about
me so comfortable, that I resolv'd I would never go a great Way
from it again, while it should be my Lot to stay on the Island.
I repos'd myself here a Week, to rest and regale myself after my
long Journey; during which, most of the Time was taken up in the
weighty Afiair of making a Cage for my Poll, who began now to be a
mere Domestic, and to be mighty well acquainted with me. Then
I began to think of the poor Kid, which I had penned in within my
little Circle, and resolv'd to go and fetch it Home, or give it some
Food; accordingly I went, and found it where I left it; for indeed it
could not get out, but almost starved for want of Food: I went and
cut Boughs of Trees, and Branches of such Shrubs as I could find, and
threw it over, and having fed it, I tied it as I did before, to lead it
away; but it was so tame with being hungry, that I had no need to
have tied it; for it foUWd me like a Dog; and as I continually fed
it, the Creature became so loving, so gentle, and so fond, that it be-
came from that Time one of my Domestics also, and would never
leave me afterwards.
The rainy Season of the Autumnal Equinox was now come, and I
kept the 30th of September in the same solemn Manner as before,
being the Anniversary of my Landing on the Island, having now
been there two Years, and no more Prospect of being deliver'd than
the first Day I came there. I spent the whole Day in humble and
thankful Acknowledgments of the many wonderful Mercies which my
Solitary Condition was attended with, and without which it might
have been infinitely more miserable. I gave humble and hearty
Thanks that God had been pleased to discover to me, even that it
was possible I might be more happy in this Solitary Condition, than
I should have been in a Liberty of Society, and in all the Pleasures
of the World . That he could fully make up to me, the Deficiencies
of my Solitary State, and the want of Human Society, by his Pre-
sence, and the Communications of his Grace to my Soul, supporting,
comforting, and encouraging me to depend upon his Providence here,
and hope for his Eternal Presence hereafter.
It was now that I began sensibly to feel how much more happy
this Life I now led was, with all its miserable Circumstances, than
the vicked, cursed, abominable Life I led all the past Part of my
Days, and now I changed both my Sorrows and my Joys; my very
Desires .tfter'd, my Affections changed their Gusts, and my Delighti
wcte perfectly new, from what they were at my first Coming, or in-
deed for the two Years past
Before, as I walked about, either on my Hunting, or for viewing
the Country; the Anguish of my Soul at my Condition, would break
out upon me on a sudden, and my very Heart would die within me,
to think of the Woods, the Mountains, the Deserts I was in; and
how I was a Prisoner locked up with the Eternal Bars and Bolts of
the Ocean, in an uninhabited Wilderness, without Redemption: In
the midst of the greatest Composures of my Mind, this would break
out upon me like a Storm, and make me wring my Hands, and weep
like a Child: Sometimes it would take me in the middle of my Work,
and I would immediately sit down and sigh, and look upon the
Ground for an Hour or two together; and this was still worse
to me; for if I could burst out into Tears, or vent myself by
Words, it would go off, and the Grief having exhausted itself
would abate.
But now I began to exercise myself with new Thoughts; I daily
read the Word of God, and apply'd all the Comforts of it to my
present State: One Morning being very sad, I open'd the Bible
upon these Words, I will never, never leave thee, nor forsake thee;
immediately it occurr'd, That these Words were to me, Why else
should they be directed in such a Manner, just at the Moment when
I was mourning over my Condition, as one forsaken of God and
Man? Well then, said I, if God does not forsake me, of what ill
Consequence can it be, or what matters it, though the World should
all forsake me, seeing on the other Hand, if I had all the World, and
should lose the Favour and Blessing of God, there would be no Com-
parison in the Loss.
From this Moment I began to conclude in my Mind, That it was
possible for me to be more happy in this forsaken Solitary Condition,
than it was probable I should ever have been in any other Particular
State in the World; and with this Thought I was going to give Thanks
Co God for bringing me to this Place.
I know not what it was, but something shocked my Mind at that
Thought, and I durst not speak the Words: How canst thou be such
a Hypocrite, (said I, even audibly) to pretend to be thankful for a
Condition, which however thou may'st endeavour to be contented
with, thou would'st rather pray heartily to be deliver'd from; so I
stopped there: But though I could not say, J thanked God for being
there; yet I sincerely gave Thanks to God for opening my Eyes, by
whatever afflicting Providences, to see the former Condition of my
Life, and to mourn for my Wickedness, and repent I never open'd
"the Bible, or shut it, but my very Soul within me blessed God for
directing my Friend in England, without any Order of mine, to pack
it up among my Goods; and for assisting me afterwards to save it
out of the Wreck of the Ship.
Thus, and in this Disposition of Mind, I began my third Year;
and though I have not given the Reader the Trouble of so particular
Account of my Works this Year as the first; yet in General it may
be observ'd, That I was very seldom idle; but having regularly
divided my Time, according to the several daily Employments that
were before me, such as, First, My Duty to God, and the Reading
the Scriptures, which I constantly set apart some Time for thrice
every Day. Secondly, The going Abroad with my Gun for Food,
which generally took me up three Hours in every Morning, when it
did not Rain. Thirdly, The ordering, curing, preserving, and cook-
ing what I had killed or caught for my Supply; these took up great
Part of the Day: also it is to be considered that the middle of the
Day when the Sun was in the Zenith, the Violence of the Heat was
too great to stir out; so that about four Hours in the Evening was
all the Time I could be suppos'd to Work in; with this Exception,
That sometimes I changed my Hours of Hunting and Working, and
went to work in the Morning, and Abroad with my Gun in the
Afternoon.
To this short Time allow'd for Labour, I desire may be added the
exceeding Laboriousness of my Work; the many Hours which for
want of Tools, want of Help, and want of Skill, everything I did
took up out of my Time: For Example, I was full two-and-forty
Days making me a Board for a long Shelf, which I wanted in my
Cave; whereas two Sawyers with their Tools, and a Saw-Pit, would
have cut six of them out of the same Tree in half a Day.
My Case was this, It was to be a large Tree, which was to be cut
down, because my Board was to be a broad one. This Tree I was
three Days a cutting down, and two more cutting off the Boughs, and
reducing it to a Log, or Piece of Timber. With inexpressible hack-
ing and hewing I reduc'd both the Sides of it into Chips, till it begun
to be light enough to move; then I turned it, and made one Side ol
it smooth, and flat, as a Board from End to End; then turning that
Side downward, cut the other Side, till I brought the Plank to be
about three Inches thick, and smooth on both Sides. Any one may
judge the Labour of my Hands in such a Piece of Work; but
Labour and Patience carry'd me through that and many other Things:
I only observe this in Particular, to show The Reason why so much of
my Time went away with so little Work, viz. That what might be a
little to be done with Help and Tools, was a vast Labour, and re-
quire a prodigious Time to do alone, and by hand.
But notwithstanding this, with Patience and Labour I went through
many Things; and indeed everything that my Circumstances made
necessary to me to do, as will appear by what follows.
I was now, in the Months of November and December, expecting
my Crop of Barley and Rice. The Ground I had manur'd or dug
up for them was not great; for as I observ'd, my Seed of each was
not above the Quantity of half a Peck; for I had lost one whole
Crop by sowing in the dry Season; but now my Crop promised very
well, when on a sudden I found I was in Danger of losing it all again
by Enemies of several Sorts, which it was scarce possible to keep
from it; as First, The Goats, and wild Creatures which I called
Hares, who tasting the Sweetness of the Blade, lay in it Night and
Day, as soon as it came up, and eat it so close, that it could get
no Time to shoot up into Stalk.
This I saw no Remedy for, but by making an Enclosure about it
with a Hedge, which I did with a great deal of Toil; and the more,
because it requir'd Speed. However, as my Arable Land was but
small, suited to my Crop, I got it totally well fenced, in about three
Weeks' Time; and shooting some of the Creatures in the Daytime,
I set my Dog to guard it in the Night, tying him up to a Stake at the
Gate, where he would stand and bark all Night long; so in a little
Time the Enemies forsook the Place, and the Corn grew very strong,
and well, and began to ripen apace.
But as the Beasts ruined me before, while my Corn was in the
Blade; so the Birds were as likely to ruin me now, when it was in
the Ear; for going along by the Place to see how it throve, I saw my
little Crop surrounded with Fowls of I know not how many sorts,
who stood as it were watching till I should be gone: I immediately
let fly among them (for I always had my Gun with me) I had no
sooner shot but there rose up a little Cloud of Fowls, which I had
not seen at all, from among the Corn itself.
This touched me sensibly, for I foresaw, that in a few Days they
.rould devour all my Hopes, that I should be starved, and never be
able to raise a Crop at all, and what to do I could not tell: How-
ever I resolv'd not to lose my Corn, if possible, though I should
watch it Night and Day. In the first Place, I went among it to
see what Damage was a heady done, and found they had spoiled a
good deal of it, but that as it was yet too Green for them, the
Loss was not so great, but that the Remainder was like to be a
good Crop if it could be saved.
I stayed by it to load my Gun, and then coming away I could easily
see the Thieves sitting upon all the Trees about me, as if they only
waited till I was gone away, and the Event proved it to be so; for as
I walked off as if I was gone, I was no sooner out of their Sight, but
they dropt down one by one into the Corn agam. I was so provok'd
that I could not have Patience to stay till more came on, knowing
that every Grain that they eat now, was, as it might be said, a Peck-
loaf to me in the Consequence; but coming up to the Hedge, I fired
again, and killed three of them. This was what I wished for; so I
took them up, and served them as we serve notorious Thieves in
England, (viz.) Hanged them in Chains for a Terror to others; it is
impossible to imagine almost, that this should have such an Effect, as
it had; for the Fowls would not only not come at the Corn, but in
short they forsook all that Part of the Island, and I could never see
a Bird near the Place as long as my Scare-Crows hung there.
This I was very glad of, you may be sure, and about the latter end
of December, which was our second Harvest of the Year, I reaped my
Crop.
I was sadly put to it for a Scythe or a Sickle to cut it down, and
all I could do was to make one as well as I could out of one of the
Broad Swords or Cutlasses, which I saved among the Arms out of the
Ship. However, as my first Crop was but small I had no great
Difficulty to cut it down; in short, I reaped it my Way, for I cut
nothing off but the Ears, and carry'd it away in a great Basket which
I had made, and so rubbed it out with my Hands; and at the End of
all my Harvesting, I found that out of my half Peck of Seed, I had
near two Bushels of Rice, and above two Bushels and half of Barley,
that is to say, by my Guess, for I had no Measure at that time.
However, this was a great Encouragement to me, and I foresaw
that in time, it would please God to supply me with Bread: And yet
here I was perplex'd again, for I neither knew how to grind or make
Meal of my Corn, or indeed how to clean it or part it; nor if made
into Meal, how to make Bread of it, and if how to make it, yet I
knew not how to bake it; these things being added to my Desire of
having a good Quantity for Store, and to secure a constant Supply, I
resolv'd not to taste any of this Crop but to preserve it all for Seed
against the next Season, and in the mean time to employ all my Study
and Hours of Working to accomplish this great Work of Providing
myself with Corn and Bread.
It might be truly said, that now I worked for my Bread; it is a
little wonderful, and what I believe few People have thought much
upon, (viz.) the strange multitude of little Things necessary in the
Providing, Producing, Curing, Dressing, Making and Finishing this
one Article of Bread.
I that was reduced to a mere State of Nature, found this to my
daily Discouragement, and was made more and more sensible of it
every Hour, even after I had got the first Handful of Seed-Corn,
which, as I have said, came up unexpectedly, and indeed to a
surprise.
First, I had no Plough to turn up the Earth, no Spade or Shovel to
dig it Well, this I conquer'd, by making a wooden Spade, as I ob-
serv'd before; but this did my Work in but a wooden manner, and
though it cost me a great many Days to make it, yet for want of Iron
it not only wore out the sooner, but made my Work the harder, and
made it be perform'd much worse.
However this I bore with, and was content to work it out with
Patience, and bear with the badness of the Performance. When the
Corn was sowed, I had no Harrow, but was forced to go over it my-
self and drag a great heavy Bough of a Tree over it, to Scratch it,
as it may be called, rather than Rake or Harrow it
When it was growing and grown, I have observ'd already, how
many things I wanted, to Fence it, Secure it, Mow or Reap it, Cure
and Carry it Home, Thrash, Part it from the Chaff, and Save it
Then I wanted a Mill to Grind it, Sieves to Dress it, Yeast and Salt to
make it into Bread, and an Oven to bake it, and yet all these things
I did without, as shall be observ'd; and yet the Corn was an in-
estimable Comfort and Advantage to me too. All this, as I said,
made everything laborious and tedious to me, but that there was no
help for; neither was my time so much Loss to me, because as I had
divided it, a certain Part of it was every Day appointed to these
Works; and as I resolv'd to use none of the Cor n for Bread till I had
a greater Quantity by me, I had the next six Months to apply myself
wholly by Labour and Invention to furnish myself with Utensils
proper for the performing all the Operations necessary for the making
the Cor n (when I had it) fit for my use.
But first, I was to prepare more Land, for I had now Seed enough
to sow above an Acre of Ground. Before I did this, I had a Week's
work at least to make me a Spade, which when it was done was but a
sorry one indeed, and very heavy, and requir'd double Labour to work
with it; however I went through that, and sowed my Seed in two
large flat Pieces of Ground, as near my House as I could find them
to my Mind, and fenced them in with a good Hedge, the Stakes of
which were all cut of that Wood which I had set before, and knew it
would grow, so that in one Year's time I knew I should have a Quick
or Living-Hedge, that would want but little Repair. This Work was
not so little as to take me up less than three Months, because great
Part of that time was of the wet Season, when I could not go
abroad.
Within Doors, that is, when it rained, and I could not go out, I
found Employment on the following Occasions; always observing,
that all the while I was at work I diverted myself with talking to my
Parrot, and teaching him to Speak, and 1 quickly learned him to
know his own Name, and at last to speak it out pretty loud POLL,
which was the first Word I ever heard spoken in the Island by any
Mouth but my own. This therefore was not my Work, but an assis-
tant to my Work, for now, as I said, I had a great Employment upon
my Hands, as follows, (viz.) I had long studied by some Means or
other, to make myself some Earthen Vessels, which indeed I wanted
sorely, but knew not where to come at them: However, considering
the Heat of the Climate, I did not doubt but if I could find out any
such Clay, I might botch up some such Pot, as might, being dried in
the Sun, be hard enough, and strong enough to bear handling, and
to hold anything that was dry, and requir'd to be kept so; and as
this was necessary in the preparing Corn, Meal, drv. which was the
Thing I was upon, I resolv'd to make some as large as I could, and
fit only to stand like Jars to hold what should be put into them.
It would make the Reader pity me, or rather laugh at me, to tell
how many awkward ways I took to raise this Paste, what odd
EOB1KSOX C3(*£OE TRACHINfi HIS PARROT TO TALK. — f,
id
misshapen ugly things I made, how many of them fell in, and how
many fell out, the Clay not being stiff enough to bear its own Weight;
how many cracked by the over violent Heat of the Sun, being set out
too hastily; and how many fell in pieces with only removing, as well
before as after they were dried; and in a word, how after having
laboured hard to find the Clay, to dig it, to temper it, to bring it
home and work it; I could not make above two large earthen ugly
things, I cannot call them Jars, in about two Months' Labour.
However, as the Sun baked these Two, very dry and hard, I lifted
them very gently up, and set them down again in two great Wicker
Baskets which I had made on purpose for them, that they might not
break, and as between the Pot and the Basket there was a little room
to spare, I stuffed it full of the Rice and Barley Straw, and these two
Pots being to stand always dry, I thought would hold my dry Corn,
and perhaps the Meal, when the Corn was bruised.
Though I miscarried so much in my Design for large Pots, yet I
made several smaller things with better Success, such as little round
Pots, flat Dishes, Pitchers and Pipkins, and any things my Hand turned
to, and the Heat of the Sun baked them strangely hard.
But all this would not answer my End, which was to get an earthen
Pot to hold what was Liquid, and bear the Fire, which none of these
could do. It happen'd after some time, making a pretty large Fire
for cooking my Meat, when I went to put it out after I had done
with it, I found a broken Piece of one of my Earthenware Vessels
in the Fire, burnt as hard as a Stone, and red as a Tile. I was
agreeably surpris'd to see it, and said to myself, that certainly they
might be made to burn whole if they would burn broken.
This set me to studying how to order my Fire, so as to make it
bur n me some Pots. I had no Notion of a Kiln, such as the Potters
bur n in, or of glazing them with Lead, though I had some Lead to do
it with; but I placed three large Pipkins, and two or three Pots in a
Pile one upon another, and placed my Firewood all round it with a
great Heap of Embers under them, I plied the Fire with fresh Fuel
round the outside, and upon the top, till I saw the Pots in the inside
red hot quite through, and observ'd that they did not crack at all;
when I saw them clear red, I let them stand in that Heat about j or 6
Hours, till I found one of them, though it did not crack, did melt or run,
for the Sand which was mixed with the Clay melted by the violence of
the Heat, and would have run into Glass if I had gone on- so I . -. _ a.
ADVENTURES OF
slacked my Fire gradually till the Pots began to abate of the red
Colour, and watching them all Night, that I might not let the Fire
abate too fast, in the Morning I had three very good, I will not say
handsome, Pipkins; and two other Earthen Pots, as hard burnt as
could be desir'd;
and one of them
perfectly glazed
with the Running
of the Sand.
After this Expe-
riment, I need not
say that I wanted
no sort of Earthen
Ware for my Use;
but I must needs
say, as to the
Shapes of them,
they were very in-
different, as any
one may suppose,
when I had no way
of making them;
but as the Children make Dirt-Pies, or as a Woman would make Pies,
who never learned to raise Paste.
No Joy at a Tiling of so mean a Nature was ever equal to mine,
when I found I had made an Earthen Pot that would bear the Fire;
and I had hardly Patience to stay till they were cold, before I set
one upon the Fire again, with ^me Water in it, to boil me some
Meat, which it did admirably well; and with a Piece of a Kid
I made some very good Broth, though I wanted Oatmeal, and
several other Ingredients, requisite to make it so good as I would
have had it been.
My next Concern was, to get me a Stone Mortar, to stamp or beat
some Corn in; for as to the Mill, there was no thought at arriving to
that Perfection of Art, with one Pair of Hands. To supply this Want
I was at a great Loss; for of all Trades in the World I was as per-
fectly unqualify'd for a Stone-cutter, as for any whatever; neither had
I any Tools to go about it with. I spent many a Day to find out a
great Stone big enough to cut hollow, and make fit for a Mortar, and

109
could find none at all; except what was in the solid Rock, and which
I had no way to dig or cut out; nor indeed were the Rocks in the
Island of Hardness sufficient, but were all of a sandy crumbling Stone,
which neither would bear the Weight of a heavy Pestle, or would
break the Cor n without filling it with Sand; so after a great deal of
Time lost in searching for a Stone, I gave it over, and resolv'd to look
out for a great
Block of hard
Wood, which I
found indeed much
easier; and getting
one as big as I had
Strength to stir, I
rounded it, and
formed it in the
Outside with my
Axe and Hatchet,
and then with the
Help of Fire, and
infinite Labour,
made a hollow
Place in it, as the
Indians in Brasil
make their Canoes.
After this, I made
agreat heavy Pestle
or Beater, of the
Wood called the
Iron-wood, and
this I prepar'd and
laid by against I
had my next Crop
of Corn, when I propos'd to myself, to grind, or rather pound m>
Cor n into Meal to make my Bread.
My next Difficulty was to make a Sieve, or Search, to dress my
Meal, and to part it from the Bran, and the Husk, without which I
did not see it possible I could have any Bread. This was a most
difficult Thing, so much as but to think on; for to be sure I had
nothing like the necessary Thing to make it; I mean fine thin Canvas,

or Stuff, to search the Meal through. And here I was at a full Stop
for many Months; nor did I really know what to do; Linen I had
none left, but what was mere Rags; I had Goat's Hair, but neither
knew I how to weave it, or spin it; and had I known how, here was
no Tools to work it with; all the Remedy that I found for this, was,
That at last I did remember I had among the Seamen's Clothes which
were saved out of the Ship, some Neckcloths of Calico or Muslin;
and with some Pieces of these, I made three small Sieves, but proper
enough for the Work; and thus I made shift for some Years; how I
did afterwards, I shall show in its Place.
The baking Part was the next Thing to be consider'd, and how I
should make Bread when I came to have Corn; for first I had no
Yeast; as to that Part, as there was no supplying the Want, so I did
not concern myself much about it: But for an Oven, I was indeed in
great Pain; at length I found out an Experiment for that also, which
was this; I made some Earthen Vessels very broad, but not deep;
that is to say, about two Foot Diameter, and not above nine Inches
deep; these I burnt in the Fire, as I had done the other, and laid
them by; and when I wanted to bake, I made a great Fire upon my
Hearth, which I had paved with some square Tiles of my own making,
and burning also , but I should not call them square.
When the Firewood was burnt pretty much into Embers, or live
Coals, I drew them forward upon this Hearth, so as to cover it all
over, and there I let them lie, till the Hearth was very hot then
sweeping away all the Embers, I set down my Loaf, or Loaves, and
whelming down the Earthen Pot upon them, drew the Embers all
round the Outside of the Pot, to keep in, and add to the Heat; and
thus, as well as in the best Oven in the World, I baked my Barley
Loaves, and became in little Time a mere Pastrycook into the
Bargain; for I made myself several Cakes of the Rice, and Puddings;
indeed I made no Pies, neither had I anything to put into them,
supposing 1 had, except the Flesh either of Fowls or Goats.
It need not be wondered at, if all these Things took me up most
Part of the third Year of my Abode here; for it is to be observ'd,
That in the Intervals of these Things, I had my new Harvest and
Husbandry to manage; for I reaped my Corn in its Season, and carry'd
it Home as well as I could, and laid it up in the Ear, in my large
Baskets, till I had Time to rub it out; for I had no Floor to thrash it
on. or Instrument to thrash it with.
And now indeed my Stock of Cor n increasing, I really wanted to
build my Barns bigger. I wanted a Place to lay it up in; for the
Increase of the Corn now yielded me so much, that I had of the Barley
about twenty Bushels, and of the Rice as much, or mo re; insomuch,
that now I resolv'd to begin to use it freely; for my Bread had been
; quite gone a great while; Also I resolved to see what Quantity would
be sufficient for me a whole Year, and to sow but once a Year.
Upon the whole, I found that the forty Bushels of Barley and Rice
J was much more than I could consume in a Year; so I resolv'd to sow
just the same Quantity every Year, that I sowed the last, in Hopes
that such a Quantity would fully provide me with Bread, dv<r.
All the while these Things were doing, you may be sure my Thoughts
run many times upon the Prospect of Land which I had seen from the
other Side of the Island, and I was not without secret Wishes that I
were on Shore there, fancying the seeing the main Land, and in an
inhabited Country, I might find some Way or other to convey myself
farther, and perhaps at last find some Means of Escape.
But all this while I made no Allowance for the Dangers of such a
Condition, and how I might fall into the Hands of Savages, and
perhaps such as I might have Reason to think far worse than the
Lions and Tigers of Africa. That if I once came into their Power, I
should run a Hazard more than a thousand to one of being killed,
and perhaps of being eaten; for I had heard that the People of the
Caribbean Coasts were Cannibals, or Man-eaters; and I knew by the
Latitude that I could not be far off from that Shore. That suppose
they were not Cannibals, yet that they might kill me, as many Europeans
who had fallen into their Hands had been served, even when they had
been ten or twenty together; much more I that was but one, and
could make little or no Defence. All these Things, I say, which I
ought to have consider'd well of, and did cast up in my Thoughts
afterwards, yet took up none of my Apprehensions at first; but my
Head run mightily upon the Thought of getting over to the Shore.
Now I wished for my Boy Xury, and the long Boat, with the
Shoulder of Mutton Sail, with which I sailed above a thousand Miles
on the Coast of Africa; but this was in vain. Then I thought I wouW
go and look at our Ship's Boat, which, as I have said, was blown up
upon the Shore, a great Way in the Storm, when we were first cast
away. She lay almost where she did at first, but not quite; and was
turned by the Force of the Waves and the Winds almost Bottom
upward, against a high Ridge of Beachy rough Sand; but no Watei
about her as before.
If I had had Hands to have refitted her, and to have launched her
into the Water, the Boat would have done well enough, and I might
have gone back into the Brasils with her easily enough; but I might
have foreseen, That I could no more turn her, and set her upright
upon her Bottom, than I could remove the Island: However, I went
to the Woods, and cut Levers and Rollers, and brought them to the
Boat, resolv'd to try what I could do, suggesting to myself, That if I
could but turn her down, I might easily repair the Damage she had
receiv'd, and she would be a very good Boat, and I might go to Sea
in her very easily.
I spared no Pains indeed, in this Piece of fruitless Toil, and spent,
I think, three or four Weeks about it; at last finding it impossible to
heave it up with my little Strength, I fell to digging away the Sand, to
undermine it, and so to make it fall down, setting Pieces of Wood to
thrust and guide it right in the Fall.
But when I had done this, I was unable to stir it up again, or to
get under it, much less to move it forward, towards the Water; so I
was forced to give it over; and yet, though I gave over the Hopes of
the Boat, my desire to venture over for the Main increased, rather than
decreased, as the Means for it seemed impossible.
This at length put me upon thinking, Whether it was not possible
to make myself a Canoe, or Periagua, such as the Natives of those
Climates make, even without Tools, or, as I might say, without Hands,
viz. of the Trunk of a great Tree. This I not only thought possible,
but easy, and pleased myself extremely with the Thoughts of making
it, and with my having much more Convenience for it than any of the
Negroes or Indians; but not at all considering the particular Inconve-
niences which I lay under, more than the Indians did, viz. Want of
Hands to move it, when it was made, into the Water, a Difficulty
much harder for me to surmount, than all the Consequences of Want
of Tools could be to them; for what was it to me, That when I had
chosen a vast Tree in the Woods, I might with much Trouble cut it
down, if after I might be able with my Tools to hew and dub the
Outside into the proper Shape of a Boat, and burn or cut out the
Inside to make it hollow, so to make a Boat of it: If after all this, I
must leave it just there where I found it, and was nat able to launch
it into the Water.
"3
One would have thought, I could not have had the least Reflection
upon my Mind of my Circumstance, while I was making this Boat;
but I should have immediately thought how I should get it into the
Sea; but my Thoughts were so intent upon my Voyage over the Sea
in it, that I never once consider'd how I should get it off of the Land;
and it was really in its own Nature more easy for me to guide it over
forty-five Miles of Sea, than about forty-five Fathom of Land, where
it lay, to set it afloat in the Water.
I went to work upon this Boat, the most like a Fool, that ever Man
did, who had any of his Senses awake. I pleased myself with the
Design, without determining whether I was ever able to undertake it;

not but that the Difficulty of launching my Boat came often into my
Head; but I put a stop to my own Inquiries into it, by this foolish
Answer which I gave myself, Let's first make it, ril warrant I'll find
tome Way or other to get it along, when it is done.
This was a most preposterous Method; but the Eagerness of my
Fancy prevail'd, and to work I went I felled a Cedar Tree: 1 ques-
tion much whether Solomon ever had such a One for the Building of
the Temple at Jerusalem. It was five Foot ten Inches Diameter at the
lower Part next the Stump, and four Foot eleven Inches Diameter at
the End of twenty-two Foot, after which it lessen'd for a while, and then
parted into Branches: It was not without infinite Labour that I felled
this Tree: I was twenty Days hacking and hewing at it at the Bottom,
I was fourteen more getting the Branches and Limbs, and the vast
spreading Head of it cut off, which I hacked and hewed through witl
Axe and Hatchet, and inexpressible Labour: After this, it cost me a
Month to shape it, and dub it to a Proportion, and to something lika
the Bottom of a Boat, that it might swim upright as it ought to do.
It cost me near three Months more to clear the Inside, and work it out
so, as to make an exact Boat of it: This I did indeed without Fire,
by mere Mallet and Chisel, and by the dint of hard Labour, till I
had brought it to be a very handsome Periagua, and big enough to
have carried six-and-twenty Men, and consequently big enough to
have carried me and all my Cargo.
When I had gone through this Work, I was extremely delighted with
it The Boat was really much bigger than I ever saw a Canoe, or
Periagua, that was made of one Tree, in my Life. Many a weary
Stroke it had cost, you may be sure; and there remain'd nothing but
to get it into the Water; and had I gotten it into the Water, I make
no question but I should have began the maddest Voyage, and the
most unlikely to be perform'd, that ever was undertaken.
But all my Devices to get it into the Water failed me; though they
cost me infinite Labour too. It lay about one hundred Yards from
the Water, and not more: But the first Inconvenience was, it was up-
hill towards the Creek; well, to take away this Discouragement, I
resolv'd to dig into the Surface of the Earth, and so make a Declivity:
This I begun, and it cost me a prodigious deal of Pains; but who
grudges Pains, that have their Deliverance in View: But when this
was worked through, and this Difficulty manag'd, it was still much at
one; for I could no more stir the Canoe, than I could the other
Boat
Then I measur'd the Distance of Ground, and resolv'd to cut a
Dock, or Canal, to bring the Water up to the Canoe, seeing I could
not bring the Canoe down to the Water: Well, I began this Work,
and when I began to enter into it, and calculate how deep it was to
be dug, how broad, how the Stuff to be thrown out, I found, That by
the Number of Hands I had, being none but my own, it must have
6een ten or twelve Years before I should have gone through with it;
for the Shore lay high, so that at the upper End, it must have been at
least twenty Foot Deep; so at length, though with great Reluctancy,
I gave this Attempt over also.
This grieved me heartily, and now I saw, though too late, the Folly
of beginning a Work before we count the Cost; and before we judge
rightly of our own Strength to go through with it
In the middle of this Work, I finished my fourth Year in this Place,
and kept my Anniversary with the same Devotion, and with as much
Comfort as ever before; for by a constant Study, and serious Appli-
cation of the Word of God, and by the Assistance of his Grace, I
gained a different Knowledge from what I had before. I entertain'd
different Notions of Things. I looked now upon the World as a Thing
remote, which I had nothing to do with, no Expectation from, and
indeed no Desires about: In a Word, I had nothing indeed to do with
it, nor was ever like to have; so I thought it looked as we may per-
haps look upon it hereafter, viz. as a Place I had lived in, but was
come out of it; and well might I say, as Father Abraham to Dives,
Between me and thee is a great Gulf fixed.
In the first Place, I was removed from all the Wickedness of the
World here. I had neither the Lust of the Flesh, the Lust of the Eye,
or the Pride of Life. I had nothing to covet; for I had all that I was
now capable of enjoying: I was Lord of the whole Manor; or if 1
pleased, I might call myself King, or Emperor over the whole Country
which I had Possession of. There were no Rivals: I had no Com-
petitor, none to dispute Sovereignty or Command with me. I might
have raised Ship Loadings of Corn; but I had no use for it; so I let
as little grow as I thought enough for my Occasion. I had Tortoise
or Turtles enough; but now and then one, was as much as I could
put to any use. I had Timber enough to have built a Fleet of Ships.
I had Grapes enough to have made Wine, or to have cured into
Raisins, to have loaded that Fleet when they had been built
But all I could make use of, was, All that was valuable. I had
enough to eat, and to supply my Wants, and, what was all the rest to
me? If I killed more Flesh than I could eat, the Dog must e;it it,
or the Vermin. If I sowed more Corn than I could eat, it must be
spoiled. The Trees that I cut down, were lying to rot on the ('.round:
I could make no more use of them than for Fuel; and that 1 had no
Occasion for, but to dress my Food.
In a Word, The Nature and Experience of Things dictated to me
upon just Reflection, That all the good Things of this World, are no
farther good to us, than they are for our Use; and that whatever we
may heap up indeed to give others, we enjoy just as much as we can
Oje, and no more. The most covetous griping Miser in the Wqrld
would have been cured of the Vice of Covetousness, if he had been in
my Case; for I possess'd infinitely more than I knew what to do with,
I had no room for Desire, except it was of Things which I had not,
and they were but Trifles, though indeed of great Use to me. I had,
as I hinted before, a Parcel of Money, as well Gold as Silver, about
thirty-six Pounds Sterling: Alas! There the nasty sorry useless Stufl
lay; I had no manner of Business for it; and I often thought with
myself, That I would have given a Handful of it for a Gross of To-
bacco Pipes, or for a Hand-Mill to grind my Corn; nay, I would have
given it all for Sixpenny-worth of Turnip and Carrot Seed out of
England, or for a Handful of Pease and Beans, and a Bottle of Ink:
As it was, I had not the least Advantage by it, or Benefit from it; but
there it lay in a Drawer and grew mouldy with the Damp of the Cave,
in the wet Season; and if I had had the Drawer full of Diamonds, it
had been the same Case; and they had been of no manner of Value
to me, because of no Use.
I had now brought my State of Life to be much easier in itself than
it was at first, and much easier to my Mind, as well as to my Body.
I frequently sat down to my Meat with Thankfulness, and admir'd
the Hand of God's Providence, which had thus spread my Table in
the Wilderness. I learned to look more upon the bright Side of my
Condition, and less upon the dark Side; and to consider what I
enjoy'd, rather than what I wanted; and this gave me sometimes
such secret Comforts, that I cannot express them; and which I take
Notice of here, to put those discontented People in Mind of it, who
cannot enjoy comfortably what God has given them; because they
see and covet something that he has not given them: All our Dis.
contents about what we want, appear'd to me, to spring from the
Want of Thankfulness for what we have.
Another Reflection was of great Use to me, and doubtless would
be so to any one that should fall into such Distress as mine was; and
this was, To compare my present Condition with what I at first ex-
pected it should be; nay, with what it would certainly have been, if
the good Providence of God had not wonderfully order'd the Ship
to be cast up nearer to the Shore, where I not only could come at
her, but could bring what I got out of her to the Shore, for my Relief
and Comfort; without which, I had wanted for Tools to work, Weapons
for Defence, or Gunpowder and Shot for getting my Food.
I spent whole Hours, I may say whole Days, in representing to
myself in the most lively Colours, how I must have acted, if I had
got nothing out of the Ship. How I could not have so much as got
any Food, except Fish and Turtles; and that as it was long before I
found any of them, I must have perished first That I should have
lived, if I had not perished, like a mere Savage. That if I had killed
a Goat, or a Fowl, by any Contrivance, I had no way to flay or open
them, or part the Flesh from the Skin, and the Bowels, or to cut it up;
but must gnaw it with my Teeth, and pull it with my Claws like a
Beast
These Reflections made me very sensible of the Goodness of Pro-
vidence to me, and very thankful for my present Condition, with all
its Hardships and Misfortunes: And this Part also I cannot but
recommend to the Reflection of those, who are apt in their Misery to
say, Is any Affliction like mine I Let them consider, How much worse
the Cases of some People are, and their Case might have been, if
Providence had thought fit
I had another Reflection which assisted me also to comfort my
Mind with Hopes; and this was, comparing my present Condition
with what I had deserv'd, and had therefore Reason to expect from
the Hand of Providence. I had lived a dreadful Life, perfectly des-
titute of the Knowledge and Fear of God. I had been well instructed
by Father and Mother; neither had they been wanting to me, in their
early Endeavours, to infuse a religious Awe of God into my Mind, a
Sense of my Duty, and of what the Nature and End of my Being
requir'd of me. But alas! falling early into the Seafaring Life, which
of all the Lives is the most destitute of the Fear of God, though His
Terrors are always before them; I say, falling early into the Seafaring
Life, and into Seafaring Company, all that little Sense of Religion
which I had entertain'd, was laughed out of me by my Messmates,
by a harden'd despising of Dangers; and the Views of Death, which
grew habitual to me; by my long Absence from all Manner of Oppor-
tunities to converse with anything but what was like myself, or to hear
anything that was good, or tended towards it
So void was I of everything that was good, or of the least Sense of
what I was, or was to be, that in the greatest Deliverances I enjoy'd,
such as my Escape from Sallee; my being taken up by the Portuguese
Master of the Ship; my being planted so well in the Brasils; my
receiving the Cargo from England, and the like; I never had once
the Word Thank God, so much as on mv Mind, or in my Mouth; nor
in the greatest Distress, had I so much as a Thought to pray to him,
or so much as to say, Lord have Mercy upon me; no nor to mention
the Name of God, unless it was to swear by, and blaspheme it
I had terrible Reflections upon my Mind for many Months, as I
have already observ'd, on the Account of my wicked and hardened
Life past; and when I looked about me and considered what parti-
cular Providences had attended me since my coming into this Place,
and how God had dealt bountifully with me; had not only punished
me less than my Iniquity had deseiVd, but had so plentifully provided
for me; this gave me great hopes that my Repentance was accepted,
and that God had yet Mercy in store for me.
With these Reflections I worked my Mind up, not only to Resig-
nation to the Will of God in the present Disposition of my Circum-
stances; but even to a sincere Thankfulness for my Condition,
and that I who was yet a living Man, ought not to complain, seeing
I had not the due Punishment cf my Sins; that I enjoy'd so many
Mercies which I had no reason to have expected in that Place; that
I ought never more to repine at my Condition but to rejoice, and to
give daily Thanks for that daily Bread, which nothing but a Crowd of
Wonders could have brought That I ought to consider I had been
fed even by Miracle, even as great as that of feeding Elijah by Ravens;
nay, by a long Series of Miracles, and that I could hardly have named
a Place in the unhabitable Part of the World where I could have
been cast more to my Advantage: A Place, where as I had no Society,
which was my Affliction on one Hand, so I found no ravenous Beast,
no furious Wolves or Tigers to threaten my Life, no venomous Crea-
tures or poisonous, which I might feed on to my Hurt, no Savages to
murder and devour me.
In a Word, as my Life was a Life of Sorrow, one way, so it was a
Life of Mercy, another; and I wanted nothing to make it a Life of
Comfort, but to be able to make my Sense of God's Goodness to me,
and Care over me in this Condition, be my daily Consolation; and
after I did make a just Improvement of these things, I went away
and was no more sad.
I had now been here so long, that many Things which I brought an
Shore for my Help, were either quite gone, or very much wasted and
near spent
My Ink, as I observed, had been gone some time, all but a very
little, which I eked out with Water a little and a little, till it was
SO pale it scarce left any Appearance of black upon the Paper: Ai
long as it lasted, I made use of it to minute down the Days of the
Month on which any remarkable Thing happen'd to me, and first by
casting up Times past: I remember that there was a strange Concur-
»ence of Days in the various Providences which befel me; and which,
if I had been superstitiously inclin'd to observe Days as Fatal or
Fortunate, I might have had Reason to have looked upon with a great
deal of Curiosity.
First I had observed, that the same Day that I broke away from
my Father and my Friends, and run away to Hull, in order to go to
Sea; the same Day afterwards I was taken by the Sallee Man of War,
and made a Slave.
The same Day of the Year that I escaped out of the Wreck of that
Ship in Yarmouth Roads, thart same Day-Year afterwards I made my
escape from Sallee in the Boat
The same Day of the Year I was born on (viz.) the 3oth of Sep-
tember, that same Day, I had my Life so miraculously saved 26 Year
after, when I was cast on Shore in this Island, so that my wicked Life,
and my solitary Life begun both on a Day.
The next Thing to my Ink's being wasted, was that of my Bread, I
mean the Biscuit which I brought out of the Ship, this I had hus-
banded to the last degree, allowing myself but one Cake of Bread a
Day for above a Year, and yet I was quite without Bread for near a
Year before I got any Corn of my own, and great Reason I had to
be thankful that I had any at all, the getting it being, as has been
already observed, next to miraculous.
My Clothes began to decay too mightily: As to Linen, I had had
none a good while, except some chequer'd Shirts which I found in
the Chests of the other Seamen, and which I carefully preserved,
because many times I could bear no other Clothes on but a Shirt;
and it was a very great help to me that I had among all the Men's
Clothes of the Ship almost three dozen of Shirts. There were also
several thick Watch Coats of the Seamen's, which were left indeed,
but they were too hot to wear; and though it is true, that the
Weather was so violent hot, that there was no need of Clothes, yet I
could not go quite naked; no, though I had been inclin'd to it,
which I was not, nor could not abide the thoughts of it, though I was
all alone.
The Reason why I could not go quite naked, was, I could not bear
ADVENTURES OP
the heat of the Sun so well when quite naked, as with some Clothe*
on ; nay, the very Heat frequently blistered my Skin ; whereas with a
Shirt on, the Air itself made some Motion and whistling under
that Shirt was twofold cooler than without it; no more could I ever
bring myself to go out in the heat of Sun without a Cap or Hat,
the heat of the Sun beating with such Violence as it does in that
Place, would give me the Head-ache presently, by darting so directly
on my Head, without a Cap or Hat on, so that I could not bear it,
whereas, if I put on my Hat, it would presently go away.
Upon those Views I began to consider about putting the few Rags
I had, which I called Clothes, into some order; I had worn out all
the Waistcoats I had, and my Business was now to try if I could not
make Jackets out of the great Watch-Coats which I had by me, and
such other Materials as I had, so I set to Work a Tailoring, or rather
indeed a Botching, for I
made most piteous Work
of it However, I made
shift to make two or
three new Waistcoats,
which I hoped would
serve me a great while;
as for Breeches or
Drawers, I made but a
sorry shift indeed, till
afterwards.
I have mentioned that
I saved the Skins of all
the Creatures that I
killed, I mean four-footed
ones, and I had hung
them up stretched out
with Sticks in the Sun, by
which means some of
them were so dry and
hard that they were fit
for little, but others it
seems were very useful
The first thing I made of these was a great Cap for my Head,
with the Hair on the Outside to shoot off the Rain: and thi»

I perform'd so well, that after this 1 made me a Suit of Clothes wholly
of these Skins, that is to say, a Waistcoat, and Breeches open at
Knees, and both loose, for they were rather wanting to keep me cool
than to keep me warm. I must not omit to acknowledge that they
were wretchedly made; for if I was a bad Carpenter, I was a worse
Tailor. However, they were such as I made very good shift with;
and when I was abroad, if it happen'd to rain, the Hair of my Waist-
coat and Cap being outermost, I was kept very dry.
After this I spent a great deal of Time and Pains to make me an
Umbrella; I was indeed in great want of one, and had a great Mind
to make one; I had seen them made in the Brasils, where they are
,-ery useful in the great Heats which are there. And I felt the Heats
every jot as great here, and greater too, being nearer the Equinox;
besides, as I was oblig'd to be much abroad, it was a most useful
thing to me, as well for the Rains as the Heats. I took a world of
Pains at it, and was a great while before I could make anything likely
to hold; nay, after I thought I had hit the Way, I spoiled 2 or j
before I made one to my Mind; but at last I made one that answer'd
indifferently well: The main Difficulty I found was to make it to let
down. I could make it to spread, but if it did not let down too, and
draw in, it was not portable for me any Way but just over my Head,
which would not do. However, at last, as I said, I made one to
answer, and covered it with Skins, the Hair upwards, so that it cast
off the Rains like a Pent-house, and kept off the Sun so effectually,
that I could walk out in the hottest of the Weather with greater
Advantage than I could before in the coolest, and when I had no
need of it, could close it and carry it under my Arm.
Thus I lived mighty comfortably, my Mind being entirely composed
by resigning to the Will of God, and throwing myself wholly upon the
Disposal of his Providence. This made my Life better than sociable,
for when I began to regret the want of Conversation, I would ask
rryself whether thus conversing mutually with my own Thoughts, and,
as I hope I may say, with even God himself by Ejaculations, was not
better than the utmost Enjoyment of human Society in the World.
I cannot say that after this, for five Years, any extraordinary thing
happened to me, but I lived on in the same Course, in the same
Posture and Place, just as before; the chief things I was emplo/d
in, besides my yearly Labour of planting my Barley and Rice, and
curing my Raisins, of both which I always kept up just enough to have
sufficient Stock of one Year's Provisions beforehand . I say, beside!
this yearly Labour, and my daily Labour of going out with my Gun,
I had one Labour to make me a Canoe, which at last I finished. So
that by digging a Canal to it of six Foot wide, and four Foot deep, I
brought it into the Creek, almost half a Mile. As for the first, which
was so vastly big, as I made it without considering before-hand, as I
ought to do, how I should be able to launch it; so never being able to
bring it to the Water, or bring the Water to it, I was oblig'd to let it lie
where it was, as a Memorandum to teach me to be wiser next Time;
Indeed, the next Time, though I could not get a Tree proper for i^
and in a Place where I could not get the Water to it, at any less Distance,
than as I have said, near half a Mile; yet as I saw it was practicable
at last, I never gave it over; and though I was near two Years about
it, yet I never grudged my Labour, in Hopes of having a Boat to go
off to Sea at last
However, though my little Periagua was finish'd, yet the Size of it
was not at all answerable to the Design which I had in View, when I
made the first; I mean, Of venturing over to the Terra Firtna, where
it was above forty Miles broad; accordingly, the Smallness of my
Boat assisted to put an Fnd to that Design, and now I thought no
more of it: But as I had a Boat, my next Design was to make a
Tour round the Island; for as I had been on the other Side, in one
Place, crossing as I have already describ'd it, over the Land; so the
Discoveries I made in that little Journey, made me very eager to see
other Parts of the Coast; and now I had a Boat, I thought of nothing
but sailing round the Island.
For this Purpose, that I might do everything with Discretion and
Consideration, I fitted up a little Mast to my Boat, and made a Sail
to it, out of some of the Pieces of the Ship's Sail, which lay in store;
and of which I had a great Stock by me.
Having fitted my Mast and Sail, and tried the Boat, I found she
would sail very well: Then I made little Lockers, or Boxes, at either
End of my Boat, to put Provisions, Necessaries and Ammunition, cVv.
into, to be kept dry, either from Rain, or the Spray of the Sea; and
a little long hollow Place I cut in the Inside of the Boat, where I
could lay my Gun, making a Flap to hang down over it to keep it dry.
I fixed my Umbrella also in a Step at the Stern, like a Mast, to
stand over my Head, and keep the Heat of the Sun off of me like an
Awning; and thus I every now and then took a little Voyage upon the
EAGER TO VIEW CIRCUMFERENCE OF MY LITTLE KINGDOM."
Sea, but iiever went far out, nor far from the little Creek; but at last
being eager to view the Circumference of my little Kingdom, I resolv'd
upon my Tour, and accordingly I victualed my Ship for the Voyage,
putting in two Dozen of my Loaves (Cakes I should rather call them)
of Barley Bread, an Earthen Pot full of parched Rice, a Food I eat a
great deal of, a little Bottle of Rum, half a Goat, and Powder and
Shot for killing more, and two large Watch-coats, of those which, as I
mention'd before, I had saved out of the Seamen's Chests; these I
took, one to lie upon, and the other to cover me in the Night
It was the sixth of November, in the sixth Year of my Reign, or my
Captivity, which you please, That I set out on this Voyage, and I
found it much longer than I expected; for though the Island itself
was not very large, yet when I came to the East Side of it, I found a
great Ledge of Rocks lie out above two Leagues into the Sea, some
above Water, some under it; and beyond that, a Shoal of Sand, lying
dry half a League more; so that I was oblig'd to go a great Way out
to Sea to double the Point
When first I discover'd them, I was going to give over my Enter-
prise, and come back again, not knowing how far it might oblige me
to go out to Sea; and above all, doubting how I should get back
again; so I came to an Anchor; for I had made me a kind of an
Anchor with a Piece of a broken Graplin, which I got out of the Ship.
Having secur'd my Boat, I took my Gun, and went on Shore,
climbing up upon a Hill, which seemed to overlook that Point, where
I saw the full Extent of it, and resolv'd to venture.
In my viewing the Sea from that Hill where I stood, I perceiv'd
a strong, and indeed, a most furious Current, which ran to the East,
and even came close to the Point; and I took the more Notice of it,
because I saw there might be some Danger; that when I came into
it, I might be carried out to Sea by the Strength of it, and not be able
to make the Island again; and indeed, had I not gotten first up upon
this Hill, I believe it would have been so; for there was the same
Current on the other Side the Island, only, that it set off at a farther
Distance; and I saw there was a strong Eddy under the Shore; so I
had nothing to do but to get in out of the first Current, and I should
presently be in an Eddy.
I lay here, however, two Days; because the Wind blowing pretty
fresh at E.S.E. and that being just contrary to the said Current, made
a great Breach of the Sea upon the Point; so '.hat it was not safe for
me to keep too close to the Shore for the Breach, nor to go too fei
off because of the Stream. „w«*»
The third Day in the Morning, the Wind having abated over Night,
the Sea was calm, and I ventur'd; but I am a warning F»W»
aU rash and ignorant Pilots; for no sooner was I come to the Point,
when even I was not my Boat's Length from the Shore but I found
my elf in a great Depth of Water, and a Current like the Sluice of a
MU1: It carried my Boat along with it with such Violence, That aU
I could do, could not keep her so much as on the Edge of it; but I
found it hurried me farther and farther out from the Eddy, which wa.
on my left Hand. There was no Wind staring to help me and all
I could do with my Paddlers signify'd nothing, and now_I began to
give myself over for lost; for as the Current was on both Sides tlie

Island, I knew in a few Leagues' Distance Uiey must join again, and
then I was irrecoverably gone; nor did I see any Possibility of avoid-
ing it; so that I had no Prospect before me but of Penshmg; not by
the Sea, for that was calm enough, but of starving for Hunger. 1 had
indeed found a Tortoise on the Shore, as big almost as I could lift,
and had tossed it into the Boat; and I had a great Jar of fresh Water,
that is to say, one of my Earthen Pots; but what was all this to being
driven into the vast Ocean, where to be sure, there was no Shore, no
main I^nd, or Island, for a thousand Leagues at least
And now I saw how easy it was for the Providence of God to make
the most miserable Condition Mankind could be in, worse. Now I
looked back upon my desolate solitary Island, as the most pleasant
Place in the World, and all the Happiness my Heart could wish for,
was to be but there again. I stretched out my Hands to it with eager
Wishes. 0 happy Desert, said I, I shall never see thee more. 0
miserable Creature, said I, whither am I going: Then I reproach'd
myself with my unthankful Temper, and how I had repin'd at my
solitary Condition; and now what would I give to be on Shore there
again. Thus we never see the true State of our Condition, till it is
illustrated to us by its Contraries; nor know how to value what we
enjoy, but by the want of it It is scarce possible to imagine the
Consternation I was now in, being driven from my beloved Island
(for so it appear'd to me now to be) into the wide Ocean, almost two
Leagues, and in the utmost Despair of ever recovering it again.
However, I worked hard, till indeed my Strength was almost exhausted,
and kept my Boat as much to the Northward, that is, towards the
Side of the Current which the Eddy lay on, as possibly I could; when
about Noon, as the Sun passed the Meridian, I thought I felt a little
Breeze of Wind in my Face, springing up from the S.S.E. This
cheered my Heart a little, and especially when in about half an Hour
more, it blew a pretty small gentle Gale. By this Time I was gotten
at a frightful Distance from the Island, and had the least Cloud or
hazy Weather interven'd, I had been undone another Way too; for I
had no Compass on Board, and should never have known how to have
steered towards the Island, if I had but once lost Sight of it; but the
Weather continuing clear, I applied myself to get up my Mast again,
spread my Sail, standing away to the North, as much as possible, to
get out of the Current
Just as I had set my Mast and Sail, and the Boat began to stretch
away, I saw even by the Clearness of the Water, some Alteration of
the Current was near; for where the Current was so strong, the Water
was foul; but perceiving the Water clear, I found the Current abate,
1 and presently I found to the East, at about half a Mile, a Breach of
1 the Sea upon some Rocks; these Rocks I found caused the Current
to part again, and as the main Stress of it ran away more Southerly,
leaving the Rocks to the North-East; so the other return'd by the
Repulse of the Rocks, and made a strong Eddy, which ran back again
to the North- West, with a very sharp Stream.
They who know what it is to have a Reprieve brought to them upon
the Ladder, or to be rescued from Thieves just a going to murder them,
or who have been in such like Extremities, may guess what my present
Surprise of Joy was, and how gladly I put my Boat into the Stream
of this Eddy, and the Wind also freshening, how gladly I spread my
Sail to it, running cheerfully before the Wind, and with a strong Tide
or Eddy under Foot
This Eddy carried me about a League in my Way back again
directly towards the Island, but about two Leagues more to the
Northward than the Current which carried me away at first; so that
when I came near the Island, I found myself open to the Northern
Shore of it, that is to say, the other End of the Island opposite to that
which I went out from.
When I had made something more than a League of Way by the
help of this Current or Eddy, I found it was spent and served me no
farther. However, I found that being between the two great
Currents, (viz.) that on the South Side, which had hurried me away,
and that on the North, which lay about a League on the other Side:
I say between these two, in the wake of the Island, I found the
Water at least still and running no Way, and having still a Breeze of
Wind fair for me, I kept on steering directly for the Island, though
not making such fresh Way as I did before.
About four o'clock in the Evening, being then within about a
League of the Island, I found the Point of the Rocks which occa-
sioned this Disaster, stretching out as is described before to the
Southward, and casting off the Current more Southwardly, had of
Course made another Eddy to the North, and this I found very strong,
but not directly setting the Way my Course lay which was due West,
but almost full North. However, having a fresh Gale, I stretched
across this Eddy slanting North-west, and in about an Hour came
within about a Mile of the Shore, where it being smooth Water, I
soon got to Land.
When I was on Shore I fell on my Knees and gave God Thanks
for my Deliverance, resolving to lay aside all Thoughts of my Deli-
verance by my Boat, and refreshing myself with such Things as I
had, I brought my Boat close to the Shore in a little Cove that I had
spied under some Trees, and laid me down to sleep, being quite
spent with the Labour and Fatigue of the Voyage.
I was now at a great Loss which Way to get Home with my Boat:
I had run so much Hazard, and knew too much the Case to think of
attempting it by the Way I went out, and what might be at the other
Side (I mean the West Side) I knew not, nor had I any Mind to run
Any more Ventures; so I oniy resoived in the Morninc to make mj
Way Westward along the Shore and to see if there was no Creek
where I might lay up my Frigate in Safety, so as to have her again if
I wanted her; in about three Mile or thereabout coasting the Shore,
I came to a very good Inlet or Bay about a Mile over, which nar-
rowed till it came to a very little Rivulet or Brook, where I found a
very convenient Harbour for my Boat, and where she lay as if she
had been in a little Dock made on Purpose for her. Here I put in.
and having stowed my Boat very safe, I went on Shore to look about
me and see where I was.
I soon found I had but a little passed by the Place where I had
been before, when I travell'd on Foot to that Shore; so taking nothing
out of my Boat, but my Gun and my Umbrella, for it was exceedingly
hot, I began my March: The Way was comfortable enough aftei
such a Voyage as I had been upon, and I reached my old Bower in
the Evening, where I found everything standing as I left it; for I
always kept it in good Order, being, as I said before, my Country House.
I got over the Fence, and laid me down in the Shade to rest my
Limbs ; for I was very weary, and fell asleep: But judge you, if you
can, that read my Story, what a Surprise I must be in, when I was
waked out of my Sleep by a Voice calling me by my Name several
times, Robin, Robin, Robin Crusoe, poor Robin Crusoe, where are you
Robin Crusoe? Where are you? Where have you been?
I was so dead asleep at first, being fatigu'd with Rowing, or Pad-
dling, as it is called, the first Part of the Day, and with walking
the latter Part, that I did not wake thoroughly, but dozing between
sleeping and waking, thought I dreamed that somebody spoke to
me: But as the Voice continu'd to repeat, Robin Crusoe, Robin
Crusoe, at last I began to wake more perfectly, and was at first
dreadfully frighted, and started up in the utmost Consternation: But
no sooner were my Eyes open, but I saw my Pott sitting on the Top
of the Hedge; and immediately knew that it was he that spoke to
me; for just in such bemoaning Language I had used to talk to
him, and teach him; and he had learned it so perfectly, that he
would sit upon my Finger, and lay his Bill close to my Face, and cry,
Poor Robin Crusoe, Where are you? Where have you been? How
come you here? and such things as I had taught him.
However, even though I knew it was the Parrot, and that indeed
it could be nobody else, it was a good while before I could
compose myself: First, I was amazed how the Creature got thither,
and then, how he should just keep about the Place, and nowhere
else: But as I was well satisfied it could be nobody but honest
Poll, I got it over; and holding out my Hand, and calling him by his
Name Poll, the sociable Creature came to me, and sat upon my
Thumb, as he used to do, and continu'd talking to me, Poor Robin
Crusoe, and how did I come here? and where had I been ? just as if he
had been overjoy'd to see me again; and so I carry'd him Home
along with me.
I had now had enough of rambling to Sea for some time, and had
enough to do for many Days to sit still, and reflect upon the Danger
I had been in: I would have been very glad to have had my Boat
again on my Side of the Island; but I knew not how it was practi-
cable to get it about; as to the East Side of the Island, which I had
gone round, I knew well enough there was no venturing that Way;
my very heart would shrink, and my very Blood run chill but to
think of it: And as to the other Side of the Island, I did not know
how it might be there; but supposing the Current ran with the same
Force against the Shore at the East as it passed by it on the other,
I might run the same Risk of being driven down the Stream, and
carried by the Island, as I had been before, of being carried away
from it; so with these Thoughts I contented myself to be without
any Boat, though it had been the Product of so many Months' Labour
to make it, and of so many more to get it unto the Sea.
In this Government of my Temper, I remain'd near a Year, lived
a very sedate retir'd Life, as you may well suppose; and my Thoughts
being very much composed as to my Condition, and fully comforted
in resigning myself to the Dispositions of Providence, I thought I
lived really very happily in all things, except that of Society.
I improv'd myself in this time in all the mechanic Exercises which
my Necessities put me upon applying myself to, and I believe could,
upon Occasion, make a very good Carpenter, especially considering
how few Tools I had.
Besides this, I arriv'd at an unexpected Perfection in my Earthen-
ware, and contriv'd well enough to make them with a Wheel, which
I found infinitely easier and better; because I made things round
and shapeable, which before were filthy things indeed to look on.
But I think I was never more vain of my own Performance, or more
joyful for anything I found out, than for my being able to make a
Tobacco-Pipe. And though it was a verj" ugly clumsy thing, when
119
It was done, and only burnt red like other Earthenware, yet as it
was hard and firm, and would draw the Smoke, I was exceedingly
comforted with it, for I had been always used to smoke, and there
were Pipes in the Ship, but 1 forgot them at first, not knowing that
there was Tobacco in
the Island; and after-
wards, when I searched
the Ship again, I could
not come at any Pipes
at all
.
In my Wicker-ware
also I improved much,
and made abundance
of necessary Baskets,
as well as my Invention
showed me, though not
very handsome, yet
they were such as were
very handy and con-
venient for my laying
things up in, or fetch-
ing things home in.
For Example, if I killed
a Goat abroad, I could
hang it up in a Tree,
flay it, and dress it, and
cut it in Pieces, and bring it home in a Basket, and the like by a
Turtle, I could cut it up, take out the Eggs, and a Piece or two of
the Flesh, which was enough for me, and bring them home in a
Basket, and leave the rest behind me. Also large deep Baskets
were my Receivers for my Corn, which I always rubbed out as soon
as it was dry, and cured, and kept it in great Baskets.
I began now to perceive my Powder abated considerably, and this
was a Want which it was impossible for me to supply, and I began
seriously to consider what I must do when I should have no more
Powder; that is to say, how I should do to kill any Goat I had, as
is observ'd in the third Year of my being here, kept a young Kid,
and bred her up tame, and I was in hope of getting a He-Goat, but I
could not by any Means bring it to pass, till my Kid grew an old Goat:

and I could never find it in my Heart to kill her, till she died at last
of mere Age.
But being now in the eleventh Year of my Residence, and, as I
have said, my Ammunition growing low, I set myself to study some
Art to trap and snare the Goats, to see whether I could not catch
some of them alive, and particularly I wanted a She-Goat great with
young.
To this Purpose I made Snares to hamper them, and I do believe
they were more than once taken in them, but my Tackle was not
good, for I had no Wire, and I always found them broken, and my
Bait devoured.
At length I resolv'd to try a Pitfall, so I dug several large Pits in
the Earth, in Places where I had observ'd the Goats used to feed,
and over these Pits I placed Hurdles of my own making too, with a
great Weight upon them; and several times I put Ears of Barley,
and dry Rice, without setting the Trap, and I could easily perceive
that the Goats had gone in and eaten up the Corn, for I could see the
Vlark of their Feet At length I set three Traps in one Night, and
going the next Morning I found them all standing, and yet the Bait
eaten and gone: This was very discouraging. However, I alter'd
my Trap, and, not to trouble you with Particulars, going one Morning
to see my Trap, I found in one of them a large old He-Goat, and in
one of the other, three Kids, a Male and two Females.
As to the old one, I knew not what to do with him, he was so
fierce I durst not go into the Pit to him; that is to say, to go
about to bring him away alive, which was what I wanted. I could
have killed him, but that was not my Business, nor would it answer my
End. So I e'en let him out, and he ran away as if he had been
frighted out of his Wits: But I had forgot then what I learned after-
wards, that Hunger will tame a Lion. If I had let him stay there
three or four Days without Food, and then have carried him some
Water to drink, and then a little Corn, he would have been as tame
as one of the Kids, for they are mighty sagacious tractable Creatures
where they are well used.
However, for the present I let him go, knowing no better at that
time; then I went to the three Kids, and taking them one by one, I tied
them with Strings together, and with some Difficulty brought them
all home.
It was a good while before thev would feed, but throwing then
«J1
some sweet Corn, it tempted them and they began to be tame; and
now I found that if I expected to supply myself with Goat-Flesh whes
I had no Powder or Shot left, breeding some up tame was my only
way, when perhaps I might have them about my House like a Flock
of Sheep.

But then it presently occurr'd to me, that I must keep the tame
from the wild, or else they would always run wild when they grew
up, and the only Way for this was to have some enclosed Piece
of Ground, well fenced either with Hedge or Pale, to keep them
in so effectually, that those within might not break out, or those with-
out break in.
This was a great Undertaking for one Pair of Hands, yet as I saw
there was an absolute Necessity of doing it, my first Piece of Work
was to find out a proper Piece of Ground, viz. where there was likely
to be Herbage for them to eat, Water for them to drink, and Cover
to keep them from the Sun.
Those who understand such Enclosures will think I had very
little Contrivance, when I pitched upon a Place very proper for all
these, being a plain open Piece of Meadow-Land or Savana, (as our
People call it in the Western Colonies,) which had two or three
little Rills of fresh Water in it, and at one end was very woody. I
say they will smile at my Forecast, when I shall tell them I began
my enclosing of this Piece of Ground in such a manner, that my
Hedge or Pale must have been at least two Mile about Nor was the
Madness of it so great as to the Compass, for if it was ten Mile about
I was like to have time enough to do it in. But I did not consider
that my Goats would be as wild in so much Compass, as if they had
had the whole Island, and I should have so much Room to chaw
them in, that I should never catch them.
My Hedge was begun and carried on, I believe about fifty Yards,
when this Thought occurr'd to me, so I presently stopped short,
and for the first beginning I resolv'd to enclose a Piece of about
150 Yards in length, and 100 Yards in breadth, which as it would
maintain as many as I should have in any reasonable time, so as my
Flock increased, I could add more Ground to my Enclosure.
This was acting with some Prudence, and I went to work with
Courage. I was about three Months hedging in the first Piece, and
till I had done it I tether'd the three Kids in the best Part of it, and
used them to feed as near me as possible to make them familiar; and
very often I would go and carry them some Ears of Barley, or a handful
of Rice, and feed them out of my Hand; so that after my Enclosure
was finished, and I let them loose, they would follow me up and
down, bleating after me for a handful of Corn.
This answer'd my End, and in about a Year and half I had a
Flock of about twelve Goats, Kids and all; and in two Years more
I had three-and-forty, besides several that I took and killed for my
Food. And after that I enclosed five several Pieces of Ground to
feed them in, with little Pens to drive them into, to take them as I
wanted, and Gates out of one Piece of Ground into another.
But this was not all, for now I not only had Goat's-Flesh to feed on
when I pleased, but Milk too, a thing which indeed in my beginning
I did not so much as think of, and which, when it came into my
Thoughts, was really an agreeable Surprise. For now I set up my
Dairy, and had sometimes a Gallon or two of Milk in a Day. And as
Nature, who gives Supplies of Food to every Creature, dictates even
naturally how to make use of it; so I that had never milked a Cow,
much less a Goat, or seen Butter or Cheese made, very readily and
handily, though after a great many Essays and Miscarriages, made me
both Butter and Cheese at last, and never wanted it afterwards.
How mercifully can our great Creator treat his Creatures, even in
those Conditions in which they seemed to be overwhelm'd in Des-
truction. How can he sweeten the bitterest Providences, and give
us cause to praise Him for Dungeons and Prisons. What a Table was
here spread for me in a Wilderness, where I saw nothing at first but
to perish for Hunger.
It would have made a Stoic smile to have seen me and my little
Family sit down to Dinner] there was my Majesty the Prince and
Lord of the whole Island; I had the Lives of all my Subjects at my
«.'J
absolute Command . I could hang, draw, give Liberty, and take it
away, and no Rebels among all my Subjects.
Then to see how like a King I dined too all alone, attended by
my Servants, Poll, as if he had been my Favourite, was the only Per-
son permitted to talk to me. My Dog who was now grown very old
and crazy, and had found no Species to multiply his Kind upon, sat
always at my Right - ._
Hand, and two
Cats, one on one
Side the Table,
and one on the
other, expecting now
and then a Bit
from my Hand, as
a Mark of special
Favour.
But these were
not the two Cats
which I brought on
Shore at first, for
they were both of
them dead, and had
been interr'd near
my Habitation by
my own Hand; but one of them having multiplied by I know
not what Kind of Creature, these were two which I had preseiVd
tame, whereas the rest ran wild in the Woods, and became in-
deed troublesome to me at last; for they would often come into my
House, and plunder me too, till at last I was obliged to shoot them, and
did kill a great many ; at length they left me with this Attendance, and
in this plentiful Manner I lived; neither could I be said to want any-
thing but Society, and of that in some time after this, I was like to
have too much.
I was something impatient, as I have observ'd, to have the Use of
my Boat; though very loth to run any more Hazards; and therefore
sometimes I sat contriving Ways to get her about the Island, and at
other Times I sat myself down contented enough without her. But I
had a strange Uneasiness in my Mind to go down to the Point of the
Island, where, as I have said, in my last Ramble, I went up the HOI

to see how the Shore lay, and how the Current set, that I might see
what I had to do: This Inclination increas'd upon me every Day,
and at length I resolv'd to travel thither by Land, following the Edge
of the Shore, I did so: But had anyone in England been to meet
such a Man as I was, it must either have frighted them, or raised a
great deal of Laughter; and as I frequently stood still to look at my-'
self, I could not but smile at the Notion of my travelling through
Yorkshire with such an Equipage, and in such a Dress: Be pleased
to take a Sketch of my Figure as follows,
I had a great high shapeless Cap, made of a Goat's Skin, with a
Flap hanging down behind, as well to keep the Sun from me, as to
shoot the Rain off from running into my Neck; nothing being so
hurtful in these Climates, as the Rain upon the Flesh under the
Clothes.
I had a short Jacket of Goat-Skin, the Skirts coming down to
about the middle of my Thighs; and a Pair of open-kneed Breeches
of the same, the Breeches were made of the Skin of an old He-Goat,
whose Hair hung down such a Length on either Side, that like Pan-
taloons' it reached to the middle of my Legs; Stockings and Shoes
I had none, but had made me a Pair of somethings, I scarce know
what to call them, like Buskins to flap over my Legs, and lace on
either Side like Spatterdashes; but of a most barbarous Shape, as
indeed were all the rest of my Clothes.
I had on a broad Belt of Goat's-Skin dried, which I drew to-
gether with two Thongs of the same, instead of Buckles, and in a
kind of a Frog on either Side of this, instead of a Sword and a Dagger,
hung a little Saw and a Hatchet, one on one Side, one on the other.
I had another Belt not so broad, and fasten'd in the same Man-
ner, which hung over my Shoulder; and at the End of it, under my
left Arm, hung two Pouches, both made of Goat's-Skin too; in one
of which hung my Powder, in the other my Shot: At my Back I
carried my Basket, on my Shoulder my Gun, and over my Head a
great clumsy ugly Goat-Skin Umbrella, but which, after all, was the
most necessary Thing I had about me, next to my Gun: As for my
Face, the Colour of it was really not so Mulatto, like as one might
expect from a Man not at all careful of it, and living within nineteen
Degrees of the Equinox. My Beard I had once suffer'd to grow
till it was about a Quarter of a Yard long; but as I had both Scissars
and Razors sufficient, I had cut it pretty short, except what grew on
my upper Lip, which I had trimmed into a large Pair of Mahometan
Whiskers, such as I had seen worn by some Turks, who I saw at Sal-
Itt; for the Moors did not wear such, though the Turks did; of these
Moustachos or Whiskers, I will not say they were long enough to
hang my Hat upon them; but they were of a Length and Shape
monstrous enough, and such as in England would have passed for
frightful.
But all this is by the by; for as to my Figure, I had so few to ob-
serve me, that it was of no manner of Consequence; so I say no
more to that Part In this kind of Figure I went my new Journey,
and was out five or six Days. I travell'd first along the Sea-Shore,
directly to the Place where I first brought my Boat to an Anchor, to get
up upon the Rocks; and having no Boat now to take care of, I went
over the Land a nearer Way, to the same Height that I was upon before,
when looking forward to the Point of the Rocks which lay out, and
which I was oblig'd to double with my Boat, as is said above: I was
surpris'd to see the Sea all smooth and quiet, no Rippling, no Motion,
no Current, any more than in other Places.
I was at a strange Loss to understand this, and resolv'd to spend
some Time in the observing it, to see if nothing from the Sets of the
Tide had occasion'd it; but I was presently convinc'd how it was, viz.
That the Tide of Ebb setting from the West, and joining with the
Current of Waters from some great River on the Shore, must be the
Occasion of this Current; and that according as the Wind blew more
forcibly from the West, or from the North, this Current came nearer,
or went farther from the Shore; for waiting thereabouts till Evening,
I went up to the Rock again, and then the Tide of Ebb being made,
I plainly saw the Current again as before, only, that it run farther off,
being near half a League from the Shore; whereas in my Case, it
*et close upon the Shore, and hurried me and my Canoe along with
it, which at another Time it would not have done.
This Observation convinc'd me, That I had nothing to do but to
observe the Ebbing and the Flowing of the Tide, and I might very
easily bring my Boat about the Island again: But when I began to
think of putting it in Practice, I had such a Terror upon my Spirits
at the Remembrance of the Danger I had been in, that I could
not think of it again with any Patience; but on the contrary, I took
up another Resolution which was more safe, though more laborious;
and this was, That I would build, or rather make me another
Periagua or Canoe; and so have one for one Side of the Island, and
one for the other.
You are to understand, that now I had, as I may call it, two
Plantations in the Island; one my little Fortification or Tent, with
the Wall about it under the Rock, with the Cave behind me, which
by this Time I had enlarg'd into several Apartments, or Caves, one
within another. One of these, which was the dryest, and largest,
and had a Door out beyond my Wall or Fortification; that is to say,
beyond where my Wall joined to the Rock, was all filled up with the
large Earthen Pots, of which I have given an Account, and with four-
teen or fifteen great Baskets, which would hold five or six Bushels
each, where I laid up my Stores of Provision, especially my Corn,
some in the Ear cut off short from the Straw, and the other rubbed
out with my Hand.
As for my Wall made, as before, with long Stakes or Piles, those
Piles grew all like Trees, and were by this Time grown so big, and
spread so very much, that there was not the least Appearance to any
one's View of any Habitation behind them.
Near this Dwelling of mine, but a little farther within the Land,
and upon lower Ground, lay my two Pieces of Corn-Ground, which I
kept duly cultivated and sowed, and which duly yielded me their
Harvest in its Season; and whenever I had occasion for more Corn,
I had more Land adjoining as fit as that
Besides this, I had my Country Seat, and I had now a tolerable
Plantation there also; for first, I had my little Bower, as I called it,
which I kept in Repair; that is to say, I kept the Hedge which
circled it in constantly fitted up to its usual Height, the Ladder
standing always in the Inside; I kept the Trees which at first were
no more than my Stakes, but were now grown very firm and tall; I
kept them always so cut, that they might spread and grow thick and
wild, and make the more agreeable Shade, which they did effectually
to my Mind. In the Middle of this I had my Tent always standing,
being a piece of a Sail spread over Poles set up for that Purpose, and
which never wanted any Repair or Renewing; and under this I had
made me a Squab or Couch, with the Skins of the Creatures I had
killed, and with other soft Things, and a Blanket laid on them, such
as belong'd to our Sea-Bedding, which I had saved, and a great
Watch-Coat to Cover me; and here, whenever I had Occasion to be
absent from my chief Seat, I took up my Country Habitation.
Adjoining to this I had my Enclosures for my Cattle, that is to say,
my Goats: And as I had taken an inconceivable deal of Fains to fence
and inclose this Ground, so I was so uneasy to see it kept entire,
lest the Goats should break through, that I never left off till with in-
finite Labour I had stuck the Outside of the Hedge so full of small
Stakes, and so near to one another, that it was rather a Pale than a
Hedge, and there was scarce Room to put a Hand through between
them, which afterwards when those Stakes grew, as they all did in the
next rainy Season, made the Enclosure strong like a Wall, indeed
•tronger than any Wall.
This will testify for me that I was not idle, and that I spared no
Pains to bring to pass whatever appear'd necessary for my comfort-
able Support; for I consider^ the keeping up a Breed of tame
Creatures thus at my Hand, would be a living Magazine of
Flesh, Milk, Butter and Cheese, for me as long as I lived in the
Place, if it were to be forty Years; and that keeping them in my
Reach, depended entirely upon my perfecting my Enclosures to such
a Degree, that I might be sure of keeping them together; which by
this Method indeed I so effectually secur'd, that when these little
Stakes began to grow, I had planted them so very thick, I was foivM
to pull some of them up again.
In this Place also I had my Grapes growing, which I principally
depended on for my Winter Store of Raisins; and which I never
failed to preserve very carefully, as the best and most agreeable Dainty
of my whole Diet; and indeed they were not agreeable only, but
physical, wholesome, nourishing, and refreshing to the last Degree.
As this was also about half Way between my other Habitation, and
the Place where I had laid up my Boat, I generally stayed, and lay here
in my Way thither; for I used frequently to visit my Boat, and I kept all
Things about or belonging to her in very good Order; sometimes I went
out in her to divert myself, but no more hazardous Voyages would I go,
nor scarce ever above a Stone's Cast or two from the Shore, I was so
apprehensive of being hurried out of my Knowledge again by the
Currents, or Winds, or any other Accident But now I come to a
new Scene of my Life.
It happen'd one Day about Noon going towards my Boat, I was
exceedingly surpris'd with the Print of a Man's naked Foot on the
Shore, which was very plain to be seen in the Sand : I stood like one
Thunder-struck, or as if I had seen *n Apparition; I listen'd, I looked
ADVENTURES OF
round me, T could hear nothing, nor see anything; I went up to *
rising Ground to look farther, I went up the Shore and down the
Shore, but it was all one, I could see no other Impression but that
one, I went to it again to see if there were any more, and to observe
if it might not be my Fancy; but there was no Room for that, for
there was exactly the very Print of a Foot, Toes, Heel, and every Part
of a Foot; how it came thither, I knew not, nor could in the least
imagine. But after innumerable fluttering Thoughts, like a Man per-
fectly confus'd and out of myself, I came Home to my Fortification,
not feeling, as we say, the Ground I went on, but terrify'd to the last
Degree, looking behind me at every two or three Steps, mistaking
every Bush and Tree, and fancying every Stump at a Distance to be a
Man; nor is it possible to describe how many various Shapes affrighted
Imagination representei Things to me in, how many wild Idcn? werr

<3»
round every Moment in my Fancy, and what strange unaccountable
Whimsies came into my Thoughts by uie Way.
When I came to my Castle, for so I think I called it ever after this,
I fled into it like one pursued; whether I went over by the Ladder as
first contriv'd, or went in at the Hole in the Rock, which I called a
Door, I cannot remember; no, nor could I remember the next morn-
ing; for never frighted Hare fled to Cover, or Fox to Earth, with
more Terror of Mind than I to this Retreat
I slept none that Night; the farther I was from the Occasion of
my Fright, the greater my Apprehensions were; which is something
contrary to the Nature of such Things, and especially to the usual
Practice of all Creatures in Fear: but I was so embarrass'd with my
own frightful Ideas of the Thing, that I formed nothing but dismal Ima-
ginations to myself, even though I was now a great way off of it Some-
times I fancied it must be the Devil; and Reason joined in with me
upon this Supposition: For how should any other Thing in human
Shape come into the Place? Where was the Vessel that brought
them? What Marks were there of any other Footsteps? And how
was it possible a Man should come there? But then to think that
Satan should take human Shape upon him in such a Place where
there could be no manner of Occasion for it, but to leave the Print
of his Foot behind him, and that even for no Purpose too, for he
could not be sure I should see it; this was an Amusement the other
Way; I consider'd that the Devil might have found out abundance
of other Ways to have terrified me than this of the single Print of a
Foot That as I lived quite on the other Side of the Island, he
would never have been so simple to leave a Mark in a Place where it
was Ten Thousand to one whether I should ever see it or not, and in
the Sand too, which the first Surge of the Sea upon a high Wind
would have defac'd entirely: All this seemed inconsistent with the
Thing itself, and with all the Notions we usually entertain of the
Subtlety of the Devil.
Abundance of such Things as these assisted to argue me out of aft
Apprehensions of its being the Devil: And I presently concluded
then, that it must be some more dangerous Creature, (viz.) That it
must be some of the Savages of the main Land over against me, who
had wander'd out to Sea in their Canoes; and either driven by the
Currents, or by contrary Winds, had made the Island ; and had been on
Shore, but were gone away again to Sea, being as loth, perhaps, to have
stayed in this desolate Island, as I would have been to have had them.
While these Reflections were rolling upon my Mind, I was very
thankful in my Thoughts, that I was so happy as not to be there-
abouts at that Time, or that they did not see my Boat, by which they
would have concluded that some Inhabitants had been in the Place,
and perhaps have searched farther for me: Then terrible Thoughts
racked my Imagination about their having found my Boat, and that
there were People here; and that if so, I should certainly have them
come again in greater Numbers, and devour me; that if it should
happen so that they should not find me, yet they would find my En
closure, destroy all my Corn, carry away all my Flock of tame Goats,
and I ihoitM r.erish at last for mere Want ..
Thus my Fear banish'd all my religious Hope; all that former
Confidence in God which was founded upon such wonderful Experi-
ence as I had had of his Goodness, now vanished, as if he that had
fed me by Miracle hitherto, could not preserve by his Power the Pro-
vision which he had made for me by his Goodness: I reproach'd
myself with my Easiness, that would not sow any more Corn one
Year than would just serve me till the next Season, as if no Accident
could intervene to prevent my enjoying the Crop that was upon the
Ground; and this I thought so just a Reproof, that I resolv'd for the
future to have two or three Years' Corn beforehand, so that whatevei
might come, I might not perish for want of Bread.
How strange a Chequer-Work of Providence is the Life of Man!
and by what secret differing Springs are the Affections hurried about
as differing Circumstances present! To-day we love what to-morrow
we hate; to-day we seek what to-morrow we shun; to-day we desire
what to-morrow we fear; nay, even tremble at the Apprehensions of;
this was exemplified in me at this Time in the most lively Manner
imaginable: for I, whose only Affliction was, that I seemed banished
from human Society, that I was alone, circumscrib'd by the boundless
Ocean, cut off from Mankind, and condemn'd to what I called
silent Life; that I was as one whom Heaven thought not worthy to
be number'd among the Living, or to appear among the rest of his
Creatures; that to have seen one of my own Species would have
seemed to me a Raising me from Death to Life, and the greatest
Blessing that Heaven itself, next to the supreme Blessing of Salvation,
could bestow; / say, that I should now tremble at the very Appre-
hensions of seeing a Man, and was ready to sink into the Ground at
but the Shadow or silent Appearance of a Man's having set his Foot
in the Island.
Such is the uneven State of human Life: And it afforded me a
great many curious Speculations afterwards, when I had a little recovex'd
my first Surprise; I consider'd that this was the Station of Life the
infinitely wise and good Providence of God had determin'd for rne,
that as I could not foresee what the Ends of Divine Wisdom might be
in all this, so I was not to dispute his Sovereignty, who, as I was his
Creature, had an undoubted Right by Creation to govern and dispose
of me absolutely as he thought fit; and who, as I was a Creature who
had offended him, had likewise a judicial Right to condemn me to
•hat Punishment he thought fit; and that it was my Part to submit to
bear his Indignation, because I had sinned against him.
I then reflected that God, who was not only Righteous but Omni-
potent, as he had thought fit thus to punish and afflict me, so he was
able to deliver me; that if he did not think fit to do it, it was my un-
question'd Duty to resign myself absolutely and entirely to his Wifl;
and on the other Hand, it was my Duty also to hope in him, pray to
him, and quietly to attend the Dictates and Directions of his daily
Providence.
These Thoughts took me up many Hours, Days; nay, I may say,
Weeks and Months; and one particular Effect of my Cogitations on
this Occasion, I cannot omit, viz. One Morning early, lying in my
Bed, and filled with Thought about my Danger from the Appearance
of Savages, I found it discompos'd me very much, upon which those
Words of the Scripture came into my Thoughts, Call upon me in the
Day of Trouble, and I will deliver, and thou shall glorify me.
Upon this, rising cheerfully out of my Bed, my Heart was not only
comforted, but I was guided and encourag'd to pray earnestly to God
for Deliverance: When I had done praying, I took up my Bible, and
opening it to read, the first Words that presented to me, were, Wail
on the Lord, and be of good Cheer, and he shall strengthen thy Heart;
wait, I say, on the Lord. It is impossible to express the Comfort this
gave me. In answer I thankfully laid down the Book, and was no
more sad, at least, not on that Occasion.
In the middle of these Cogitations, Apprehensions and Reflections,
it came into my Thought one Day, that all this might be a mere
Chimera of my own; and that this Foot might be the Print of my
own Foot, when I came on Shore from my Boat; This cheered me
up a little too, and I began to persuade myself it was all a Delusion;
that it was nothing else but my own Foot, and why might not I come
that way from the Boat, as well as I was going that way to the Boat;
again, I consider'd also that I could by no Means tell for certain where
I had trod, and where I had not; and that if at last this was only the
Print of my own Foot, I had played the part of those Fools, who strive
to mate stories of Spectres, and Apparitions; and then are frighted IX
them more than anybody.
Now I began to take Courage, and to peep abroad again; for I ha»1
Dot stirred out of my Castle for three Days and Nights; so that J
began to starve for Provision; for I had little or nothing within
Doors, but some Barley Cakes and Water. Then I knew that my
Goats wanted to be milked too, which usually was my Evening Diver-
sion; and the poor Creatures were in great Pain and Inconvenience
for want of it; and indeed, it almost spoiled some of them, and almost
dried up their Milk.
Heartening myself therefore with the belief that this was nothing but
the Print of one of my own Feet, and so I might be truly said to start
at my own Shadow, I began to go abroad again, and went to my
Country House, to milk my Flock; but to see with what Fear I went
forward, how often I looked behind me, how I was ready every now
and then to lay down my Basket, and run for my Life, it would have
made anyone have thought I was haunted with an evil Conscience,
or that I had been lately most terribly frighted, and so indeed I had.
However, as I went down thus two or three Days, and having seen
nothing, I began to be a little bolder; and to think there was really
nothing in it, but my own Imagination: But I could not persuade
myself fully of this, till I should go down to the Shore again, and see
this Print of a Foot, and measure it by my own, and see if there was
any Similitude or Fitness, that I might be assur'd it was my own
Foot: But when I came to the Place, First, it appeared evidently
to me, that when I laid up my Boat, I could net possibly be on Shore
anywhere there about Secondly, When I came to measure the Mark
with my own Foot, I found my Foot not so large by a great deal;
both these Things filled my Head with new Imaginations, and gave me
the Vapours again, to the highest Degree; so that I shook with cold,
like one in an Ague: And I went Home again, filled with the Belief
that some Man or Men had been on Shore there; or in short, that
the Island was inhabited, and I might be surpris'd before I was
aware; and what course to take for my Security I knew not
O what ridiculous Resolution Men take, when possess'd with Fear!
It deprives them of the Use of those Means which Reason offers for
their Relief. The first Thing I propos'd to myself, was, to throw
down my Enclosures, and turn all my tame Cattle wild into the Woods,
that the Enemy might not find them; and then frequent the Island
in Prospect of the same, or the like Booty: Then to the simple
Thing of Digging up my two Corn Fields, that they might not find
such a Grain there, and still be prompted to frequent the Island;
then to demolish my Bower, and Tent, that they might not see any
Vestiges of Habitation, and be prompted to look farther, in order to
find out the Persons inhabiting.
These were the Subject of the first Night's Cogitation, after I was
come Home again, while the Apprehensions which had so over-run
my Mind were fresh upon me, and my Head was full of Vapours, as
above. Thus Fear of Danger is ten thousand Times more terrifying
than Danger itself, when apparent to the Eyes; and we find the
Burden of Anxiety greater by much, than the Evil which we are
anxious about; and which was worse than all this, I had not that
Reli ef in this Trouble from the Resignation I used to practise, that I
hop ed to have. I looked, I thought, like Saul, who complain'd not
only that the Philistines were upon him; but that God had forsaken
him; for I did not now take due Ways to compose my Mind, by
crying to God in my Distress, and resting upon his Providence, as I
had done before, for my Defence and Deliverance; which if I had
done, I had, at least, been more cheerfully supported under this new
Surprise, and perhaps carried through it with more Resolution.
This Confusion of my Thoughts kept me waking all Night; but in
the Morning I fell asleep, and having by the Amusement of my Mind,
been, as it were, tired, and my Spirits exhausted; I slept very roundly,
and waked much better compos'd than I had ever been before; and
now I began to think sedately; and upon the utmost Debate with
myself, I concluded, That this Island, which was so exceedingly
pleasant, fruitful, and no farther from the main Land than as I had
seen, was not so entirely abandon'd as I might imagine: That
although there were no stated Inhabitants who lived on the Spot;
yet that there might sometimes come Boats off from the Shore, who
either with Design, or perhaps never, but when they were driven by
cross Winds, might come to this Place.
That I had lived here fifteen Years now, and had not met with the
least Shadow or Figure of any People yet; and that if at any Time
they should be driven here, it was probable they went away again as
loon as ever they could, seeing they had never thought fit to fix there
upon any Occasion, to this Time.
That the most I could suggest any Danger from, was, from any
such casual accidental Landing of straggling People from the Main,
who, as it was likely if they were driven hither, were here against their
Wills; so they made no stay here, but went off again with all possible
Speed, seldom staying one Night on Shore, lest they »hould not have
the Help of the Tides, and Daylight back again; and that therefore
I had nothing to do but to consider of some safe Retreat, in Case I
ihould see any Savages land upon the Spot
Now I began sorely to repent, that I had dug my Cave so large, as
to bring a Door through again, which Door, as I said, came out
beyond where my Fortification joined to the Rock; upon maturely
considering this therefore, I resolv'd to draw me a second Fortifica-
tion, in the same Manner of a Semicircle, at a Distance from my
Wall, just where I had planted a double Row of Trees, about twelve
Years before, of which I made mention: These Trees having been
planted so thick before, they wanted but a few Piles to be driven
between them, that they should be thicker, and stronger, and my
Wall would be soon finish'd.
So that I had now a double Wall, and my outer Wall was thickened
with Pieces of Timber, old Cables, and everything I could think of,
to make it strong; having in it seven little Holes, about as big as I
might put my Arm out at: In the Inside of this, I thickened my
Wall to above ten Foot thick, with continual bringing Earth out of
my Cave, and laying it at the Foot of the Wall, and walking upon it;
and through the seven Holes, I contriv'd to plant the Muskets, of
which I took Notice, that I got seven on Shore out of the Ship;
these, 1 say, I planted like my Cannon, and fitted them into Frames
that held them like a Carriage, that so I could fire all the seven
Guns in two Minutes' Time: This Wall I was many a weary Month
a finishing, and yet never thought myself safe till it was done.
When this was done, I stuck all the Ground without my Wall, for
a great way every way, as full with Stakes or Sticks of the Osier-\ike
Wood, which I found so apt to grow, as they could well stand; inso-
much, that I believe I might set in near twenty thousand of them,
leaving a pretty large Space between them and my Wall, that I might
hive room to see an Enemy, and they might have no shelter from the
young Trees, if they attempted to approach my outer Wall
.
Thus in two Years' Time I had a thick Grove, and in five or six
Years' Time I had a Wood before my Dwelling, growing so monstrous
thick and strong, that it was indeed perfectly impassable; and no
Men of what kind soever, would ever imagine that there was anything
beyond it, much less a Habitation: As for the Way which I propos'd
to myself to go in and out, for I left no Avenue, it was by setting two
Ladders; one to a Part of the Rock which was low, and then broke
in, and left rocm to place another Ladder upon that; so when the
two Ladders were taken down, no Man living could come down to
me without mischieving himself; and if they had come down, they
were still on the Outside of my outer Wall.
Thus I took all the Measures human Frudence could suggest for
my own Preservation; and it will be seen at length, that they were
not altogether without just Reason; though I foresaw nothing at that
Time, more than my mere Fear suggested to me.
While this was doing, I was not altogether Careless of my other
Affairs; for I had a great Concern upon me, for my little Herd of
Goats; they were not only a present Supply to me upon every
Occasion, and began to be sufficient to me, without the Expense of
Powder and Shot; but also without the Fatigue of Hunting after the
wild Ones, and I was loth to lose the Advantage of them, and to
have all to nurse up over again.
To this Purpose, after long Consideration, I could think of but two
Ways to preserve them; one was to find another convenient Place to
dig a Cave Under-ground, and to drive them into it every Night;
and the other was to enclose two or three little Bits of Land, remote
from one another and as much conceal'd as I could, where I might
keep about half a Dozen young Goats in each Place: So that if
any Disaster happen'd to the Flock in general, I might be able to
raise them again with little Trouble and Time: And this, though it
would require a great deal of Time and Labour, I thought was the
most rational Design.
Accordingly I spent some Time to find out the most retir'd Tarts
of the Island; and I pitched upon one which was as private indeed
as my Heart could wish for; it was a little damp Piece of Ground in
the Middle of the hollow and thick Woods, where, as is observ'd, I
almost lost myself once before, endeavouring to come back that Way
from the Eastern Part of the Island: Here I found a clear Piece of
Land near three Acres, so surrounded with Woods, that it was almost
an Enclosure by Nature, at least it did not want near so much Labour
to make it so, as the other Pieces of Ground I had worked so
hard at
I immediately went to Work with this Piece of Ground, and in less
than a Month's Time, I had so fenced it round, that my Flock or
Herd, call it which you please, who were not so wild now as at first
they might be supposed to be, were well enough secur'd in it So
without any further Delay, I removed ten young She-goats and two
He-goats to this Piece; and when they were there, I continued to
perfect the Fence till I had made it as secure as the other, which,
however, I did at more Leisure, and it took me up more Time by a
great deal.
All this Labour I was at the Expense of, purely from my Apprehen
sions on the Account of the Print of a Man's Foot which I had seen;
for as yet I never saw any human Creature come near the Island, and
I had now lived two Years under these Uneasinesses, which indeed
made my Life much less comfortable than it was before; as may well
be imagin'd by any who know what it is to live in the constant Snare
of the Fear of Man; and this I must observe with Grief too, that the
Discomposure of my Mind had too great Impressions also upon the
religious Part of my Thoughts, for the Dread and Terror of falling
into the Hands of Savages and Cannibals, lay so upon my Spirits, that
I seldom found myself in a due Temper for Application to my Maker,
at least not with the sedate Calmness and Resignation of Soul which
I was wont to do; I rather prayed to God as under great Affliction
and Pressure of Mind, surrounded with Danger, and in Expectation
every Night of being murder'd and devour^ before Morning; and I
must testify from my Experience, that a Temper of Peace, Thankful-
ness, Love and Affection, is much more the proper Frame for
Prayer than that of Terror and Discomposure; and that under the
Dread of Mischief impending, a Man is no more fit for a comforting
Performance of the Duty of praying to God, than he is for Repentance
on a sick Bed: For these Discomposures affect the Mind as the
others do the Body; and the Discomposure of the Mind must
necessarily be as great a Disability as that of the Body, and much
greater, Praying to God being properly an Act of the Mind, not of
the Body.
But to go on; After I had thus secur'd one Part of my little living
Stock, I went about the whole Island, searching for another private
Place, to make such another Deposit; when wandering more to the
West Point of the Island, than I had ever done yet; and looking out
to Sea, I thought I saw a Boat upon the Sea, at a great Distance; I
had found a Prospective-Glass, or two, in one of the Seamen's Chests,
which I saved out of our Ship; but I had it not about me, and
this was so remote, that I could not tell what to make of it;
though I looked at it till my Eyes were not ?ble to hold to look any
tof.ger; whether it was a Boat, or not, I do not know; but as 1
descended from the Hill, I could see no more of it, so I gave it
over; only I resolv'd to go no more out without a Prospective-
Glass in my Pocket
When I was come down the Hill, to the End of the Island, where
indeed I had never been before, I was presently convinc'd, that the
Print of a Man's Foot, was not such a strange Thing in the Island as I
imagin'd; and but that it was a special Providence that I was cast upon
the Side of the Island, where the Savages never came: I should
easily have known, that nothing was more frequent than for the
Canoes from the Main, when they happen'd to be a little too far out
at Sea, to shoot over to that Side of the Island for Harbour; like-
wise as they often met, and fought in their Canoes, the Victors having
taken any Prisoners, would bring them over to this Shore, where
according to their dreadful Customs, being all Cannibals, they would
kill and eat them; of which hereafter.
When I was come down the Hill, to the Shore, as I said above,
being the S. IV. Point of the Island, I was perfectly confounded and
amaz'd; nor is it possible for me to express the Horror of my Mind,
at seeing the Shore spread with Skulls, Hands, Feet, and other Bones
of human Bodies; and particularly I observ'd a Place where there
had been a Fire made, and a Circle dug in the Earth, like a Cockpit,
where it is suppos'd the Savage Wretches had sat down to their in-
human Feastings upon the Bodies of their Fellow-Creatures.
I was so astonish'd with the Sight of these Things, that I enter-
tain'd ro Notions of any Danger to myself from it for a long while;
All my Apprehensions were buried in the Thoughts of such a Pitch
of inhuman, hellish Brutality, and the Horror of the Degeneracy of
Human Nature; which though I had heard of often, yet I never had
so near a View of before; in short, I turned away my Face from the
horrid Spectacle; my Stomach grew sick, and I was just at the Point
of Fainting, when Nature discharg'd the Disorder from my Stomach;
and having vomited with an uncommon Violence, I was a little
:eliev'd; but could not bear to stay in the Place a Moment; so I
gat me up the Hill again, with all the Speed I could, and walked on
towards my own Habitation.
When I came a little out of that Part of the Island, I stood still
awhile as amaz'd; and then recovering myself, I looked up with the
utmost Affection of my Soul, and with a Flood of Tears in ras Eyes,
gave God Thanks that had cast my first Lot in a Part of the World,
where I was distinguish'd from such dreadful Creatures as these; and
that though I had esteem'd my present Condition very miserable,
had yet given me so many Comforts in it, that I had still more to
give Thanks for than to complain of; and this above all, that I had
even in this miserable Condition been comforted with the Knowledge
of himself, and the Hope of his Blessing, which was a Felicity more
than sufficiently equivalent to all the Misery which I had sufier'd, or
could suffer.
In this Frame of Thankfulness, I went Home to my Castle, and
began to be much easier now, as to the Safety of my Circumstances,
than ever I was before; for I obseiVd, that these Wretches never
came to this Island in search of what they could get; perhaps not
seeking, not wanting, or not expecting anything here; and having
often, no doubt, been up in the cover'd woody Part of it, without
finding anything to their Purpose. I knew I had been here now
almost eighteen Years, and never saw the least Footsteps of Human
Creature there before; and I might be here eighteen more, as entirely
conceal'd as I was now, if I did not discover myself to them, which
I had no manner of Occasion to do, it being my only Business to
keep myself entirely conceal'd where I was, unless I found a better
sort of Creatures than Cannibals to make myself known to.
Yet I entertain'd such an Abhorrence of the Savage Wretches, that
I have been speaking of, and of the wretched inhuman Custom of
their devouring and eating one another up, that I continu'd pensive,
and sad, and kept close within my own Circle for almost two Years
after this: When I say my own Circle, I mean by it, my three Plan-
tations, viz. my Castle, my Country Seat, which I called my Bower,
and my Enclosure in the Woods; nor did I look after this for any
other Use than as an Enclosure for my Goats; for the Aversion
which Nature gave me to these hellish Wretches, was such, that I was
fearful of seeing them, as of seeing the Devil himself; nor did I so
much as go to look after my Boat, in all this time; but began rather
to think of making me another; for I could not think of ever making
any more Attempts, to bring the other Boat round the Island to me,
lest I should meet with some of these Creatures at Sea, in which, if I
had happen'd to have fallen into their Hands, I knew what would
have been my Ix>t
Time however, and the Satisfaction I had, that I was in no Danger
of being discover'd by these People, began to wear off my Uneasiness
about them; and I began to live just in the same compos'd Manner
as before; only with this Difference, that I used more Caution, and
kept my Eyes more about me than I did before, lest I should happen
to be seen by any of them; and particularly, I was more cautious of
firing my Gun, lest any of them being on the Island, should happen
to hear of it; and it was therefore a very good Providence to me, that
I had furnish'd myself with a tame Breed of Goats, that I needed not
hunt any more about the Woods, or shoot at them; and if I did
catch any of them after this, it was by Traps and Snares, as I had done
before; so that for two Years after this, I believe I never fired my
Gun once off, though I never went out without it; and which was
more, as I had saved three Pistols out of the Ship, I always carried
them out with me, or at least two of them, sticking them in my Goat-
skin Belt; also I furbish'd up one of the great Cutlasses, that I had
out of the Ship, and made me a Belt to put it on also; so that I was
now a most formidable Fellow to look at, when I went abroad, if you
add to the former Description of myself, the Particular of two Pistols,
and a great broad Sword, hanging at my Side in a Belt, but without
a Scabbard.
Things going on thus, as I have said, for some Time, I seemed,
excepting these Cautions, to be reduc'd to my former calm, sedate
Way of Living, all these Things tended to showing me more and
more how far my Condition was from being miserable, compar'd to
some others; nay, to many other Particulars of Life, which it might
have pleased God to have made my Lot It put me upon reflecting,
How little repining there would be among Mankind, at any Condition
of Life, if People would rather compare their Condition with those
that are worse, in order to be thankful, than be always comparing
them with those which are better, to assist their Murmurings and
Complainings.
As in my present Condition there were not really many Things
which I wanted; so indeed I thought that the Frights I had been
in about these Savage Wretches, and the Concern I had been in for
my own Preservation, had taken off the Edge of my Invention for my
own Conveniences; and I had dropped a good Design, which I had
once bent my Thoughts too much upon; and that was, to try if I
could not make some of my Barley into Malt, and then try to brew
a) self some Beer: This was really a whimsical Thought, and I re-
prov'd myself often for the Simplicity of it; for I presently saw there
would be the Want of several Things necessary to the making my
Beer, that it would be impossible for me to supply: as First, Casks
to preserve it in, which was a Thing, that as I have observ'd already,
I could never compass; no, though I spent not many Days, bat
Weeks, nay, Months in attempting it, but to no purpose. In the next
Place, I had no Hops to make it keep, no Yeast to make it work, no
Copper or Kettle to make it boil; and yet all these Things, notwith-
standing, I verily believe, had not these Things interven'd, I mean
the Frights and Terrors I was in about the Savages, I had undertaken
it, and perhaps brought it to pass too; for I seldom gave anything
over without accomplishing it, when I once had it in my Head enough
to begin it
But my Invention now run quite another Way; for Night and Day
I could think of nothing but how I might destroy some of these
Monsters in their cruel bloody Entertainment, and if possible, save
the Victim they should bring hither to destroy. It would take up a
larger Volume than this whole Work is intended to be, to set down
all the Contrivances I hatched, or rather brooded upon in my Thought,
for the destroying these Creatures, or at least frighting them, so as to
prevent their coming hither any more; but all was abortive, nothing
could be possible to take effect, unless I was to be there to do it
myself; and what could one Man do among them, when perhaps there
might be twenty or thirty of them together, with their Darts, or their
Bows and Arrows, with which they could shoot as true to a Mark, as
I could with my Gun?
Sometimes I contriv'd to dig a Hole under the Place where they
made their Fire, and put in five or six Pound of Gunpowder, which
when they kindled their Fire, would consequently take Fire, and blow
up all that was near it; but as in the first Place I should be very loth
to waste so much Powder upon them, my Store being now within the
Quantity of one Barrel; so neither could I be sure of its going off,
at any certain Time, when it might surprise them, and at best, that
it would do little more than just blow the Fire about their Ears and
fright them, but not sufficient to make them forsake the Place; so I
laid it aside, and then propos'd, that I would place myself in Ambush,
in some convenient Place, with my three Guns, all double loaded;
and in the middle of their bloody Ceremony, let fly at them, when I
should be sure to kill or wound perhaps two or three at every Shoot;
»5'
and then falling in upon them with my three Pistols, and my Sword,
I made no doubt, but that if there was twenty I should kill them all:
This Fancy pleased my Thoughts for some Weeks, and I was so full
of it, that I often dreamed of it; and sometimes that I was just going
to let fly at them in my Sleep.
I went so far with it in my Imagination, that I employ'd myself
severai Days to find out proper Places to put myself in Ambuscade,
as I said, to w,<tch for them; and I went frequently to the Place
itself, which was now grown more familiar to me ; and especially while
my Mind was thus filled with Thoughts of Revenge, and of a bloody
putting twenty or thirty of tliem to the Sword, as I may call it; the
Horror I had at the Place, and at the Signals of the barbarous
Wretches devouring one another, abated my Malice.
Well, at length I found a Place in the Side of the Hill, where I was
satisfied I might securely wait till I saw any of their Boats coming,
and might then, even before they would be ready to come on Shore,
convey myself unseen into Thickets of Trees, in one of which
there was a Hollow large enough to conceal me entirely; and
where I might sit and observe all their bloody Doings, and
take my full aim at their Heads, when they were so close to-
gether, as that it would be next to impossible that I should miss
my Shoot, or that I could fail wounding three or four of them at the
first Shoot
In this Place then I resolv'd to fix my Design, and accordingly I
prepared two Muskets and my ordinary Fowling Piece. The two
Muskets I loaded with a Brace of Slugs each, and four or five smaller
Bullets, about the Size of Pistol Bullets; and the Fowling Piece I
loaded with near a Handful of Swan-shot, of the largest Size; I also
loaded my Pistols with about four Bullets each, and in this Posture,
well provided with Ammunition for a second and third Charge, I pre-
par'd myself for my Expedition.
After I had thus laid the Scheme of my Design, and in my Imagi-
nation put it in Practice, I continually made my Tour every Morning
up to the Top of the Hill, which was from my Castle, as I called it,
about three Miles, or more, to see if I could observe any Boats upon
the Sea, coming near the Island, or standing over towards it; but
I began to tire of this hard Duty, after I had for two or three Months
constantly kept my Watch; but came always back without any
Discovery, there having not in all that Time been the least Appear
ance, not only on or near the Shore, but not on the whole Ocean, so
far as my Eyes or Glasses could reach every Way.
As long as I kept up my daily Tour to the Hill, to look out; so long
also I kept up the Vigour of my Design, and my Spirits seemed to be
all the while in a suitable Form, for so outrageous an Execution as
the killing twenty or thirty naked Savages, for an Offence which I had
not at all entered into a Discussion of in my Thoughts, any farther
than my Passions were at first fired by the Horror I conceiv'd at the
unnatural Custom of that People of the Country, who it seems had
been suffer'd by Providence in his wise Disposition of the World, to
have no other Guide than that of their own abominable and vitiated
Passions; and consequently were left, and perhaps had been so for
some Ages, to act such horrid Things, and receive such dreadful
Customs, as nothing but Nature entirely abandon'd of Heaven, and
acted by some hellish Degeneracy, could have run them into: But
now when, as I have said, I began to be weary of the fruitless Excur-
sion, which I had made so long, and so far, every Morning in vain, so
my Opinion of the Action itself began to alter, and I began with
cooler and calmer Thoughts to consider what it was I was going to
engage in. What Authority, or Call I had, to pretend to be Judge
and Executioner upon these Men as Criminals, whom Heaven had
thought fit for so many Ages to suffer unpunish'd, to go on, and to be
as it were, the Executioners of his Judgments one upon another. How
far these People were Offenders against me, and what Right I had to
engage in the Quarrel of that Blood, which they shed promiscuously
one upon another. I debated this very often with myself thus; How
do I know what God himself judges in this particular Case; it is
certain these People either do not commit this as a Crime; it is not
against their own Consciences reproving, or their Light reproaching
them. They do not know it to be an Offence, and then commit it in
Defiance of Divine Justice, as we do in almost all the Sins we commit
They think it no more a Crime to kill a Captive taken in War, than
we do to kill an Ox; nor to eat human Flesh, than we do to eat
Mutton.
When I had consider'd this a little, it follow'd necessarily, that I was
certainly in the Wrong in it, that these People were not Murderers, in
the Sense that I had before condemn'd them, in my Thoughts; any
more than those Christians were Murderers, who often put to Death
the Prisoners taken in Battle; or more frequently, upon many Occsr
sions, put whole Troops of Men to the Sword, without giving Quarter,
though they threw down their Arms and submitted.
In the next Place it occurr'd to me, that albeit the Usage they thus
gave one another, was thus brutish and inhuman; yet it was really
nothing to me: These People had done me no Injury. That if they
attempted me, or I saw it necessary for my immediate Preservation to
fall upon them, something might be said for it; but that as I was yet
out of their Power, and they had really no Knowledge of me, and
consequently no Design upon me; and therefore it could not be just
for me to fall upon them. That this would justify the Conduct of the
Spaniards in all their Barbarities practis'd in America, and where
they destroy'd Millions of these People, who however they were
Idolaters and Barbarians, and had several bloody and barbarous
Rites in their Customs, such as sacrificing human Bodies to their Idols,
were yet, as to the Spaniards, very innocent People; and that the
rooting them out of the Country, is spoken of with the utmost Ab-
horrence and Detestation, by even the Spaniards themselves, at this
Time; and by all other Christian Nations of Europe, as a mere
Butchery, a bloody and unnatural Piece of Cruelty, unjustifiable
either to God or Man; and such, as for which the very Name of a
Spaniard is reckon'd to be frightful and terrible to all People of
Humanity, or of Christian Compassion: As if the Kingdom of Spain
were particularly Eminent for the Product of a Race of Men, who
were without Principles of Tenderness, or the common Bowels of
Pity to the Miserable, which is reckon'd to be a Mark of generous
Temper in the Mind.
These Considerations really put me to a Pause, and to a kind of a
Full-stop ; and I began by little and little to be off of my Design, and
to conclude, I had taken wrong Measures in my Resolutions to attack
the Savages; that it was not my Business to meddle with them, un- 1
less they first attack'd me, and this it was my Business if possible to
prevent; but that if I were discover'd, and attack'd, then I knew my
\. Duty.
On the other hand, I argu'd with myself, That this really was the way
not to deliver myself, but entirely to ruin and destroy myself; for un-
less I was sure to kill every one that not only should be on Shore at
that Time, but that should ever come on Shore afterwards, if but one
of them escap'd to tell their Country People what had happen'd, they
would come over again by Thousands to revenge the Death of their
Fellows, and I should only bring upon myself a certain Destruction,
which at present I had no manner of occasion for.
Upon the whole I concluded, That neither in Principles nor in
Policy, I ought one way or other to concern myself in this affair.
That my Business was by all possible Means to conceal myself from
them, and not to leave the least Signal to them to guess by, that
there were any living Creatures upon the Island; I mean of human
Shape.
Religion joined in with this Prudential, and I was convinc'd now
many Ways, that I was perfectly out of my Duty, when I was laying
all my Bloody Schemes for the Destruction of innocent Creatures, I
mean innocent as to me: As to the Crimes they were guilty of to-
wards one another, I had nothing to do with them; they were
National, and I ought to leave them to the Justice of God, who is the
Governor of Nations, and knows how by National Punishments to
make just Retribution for National Offences; and to bring public
Judgments upon those who offend in a public Manner, by such Ways
as best pleases him.
This appear'd so clear to me now, that nothing was a greater
Satisfaction to me, than that I had not been suffer'd to do a Thing
which I now saw so much Reason to believe would have been no
less a Sin, than that of wilful Murder, if I had committed it; and I
gave most humble Thanks on my Knees to God, that had thus de-
liver'd me from Blood-Guiltiness; beseeching him to grant me the
Protection of his Providence, that I might not fall into the Hands
of the Barbarians; or that I might not lay my Hands upon them,
unless I had a more clear Call from Heaven to do it, in Defence of
my own Life.
In this Disposition I continu'd, for near a Year after this; and so
far was I from desiring an Occasion for falling upon these Wretches,
that in all that Time, I never once went up the Hill to see whether
there were any of them in Sight, or to know whether any of them
had been on Shore there, or not, that I might not be tempted to re-
new any of my Contrivances against them, or be provok'd by anj
Advantage which might present itself, to fall upon them; only this I
did, I went and remov'd my Boat, which I had on the other Side
the Island, and carried it down to the East End of the whole Island,
where I ran it into a little Cove which I found under some high Rocks,
and where I knew, by Reason of Currents, the Savages durst no^
at least would not come with their Boats, upon any Account whatso-
ever.
With my Boat I carried away everything that I had left there be-
longing to her, though not necessary for the bare going thither, vit.
A Mast and Sail which I had made for her, and a thing like an An-
chor, but indeed which could not be called either Anchor or Grap-
pling; however, it was the best I could make of its kind: all these
I remov'd, that there might not be the least Shadow of any Dis-
covery, or any Appearance of any Boat, or of any human Habitation
upon the Island.
Besides this, I kept myself, as I said, more retir'd than ever, and
seldom went from my Cell, other than upon my constant Employment,
viz. To milk my She-Goats, and manage my little Flock, in the
Wood; which as it was quite on another Part of the Island, was
quite out of Danger; for certain it is, that these Savage People who
sometimes haunted this Island, never came with any Thoughts of
finding anything here; and consequently never wandered off from
the Coast; and I doubt not, but they might have been several Times
on the Shore, after my Apprehensions of them had made me cautious
as well as before; and indeed, I looked back with some Horror upon
the Thoughts of what my Condition would have been, if I had
chopped upon them, and been discover'd before that, when naked
and unarm'd, except with one Gun, and that loaded often only with
small Shot, I walked everywhere peeping, and peeping about the
Island, to see what I could get; what a Surprise should I have been
in, if when I discover'd the Print of a Man's Foot, I had instead of
that, seen afteen or twenty Savages, and found them pursuing me, and
by the Swiftness of their Running, no Possibility of my escaping
them.
The Thoughts of this sometimes sunk my very Soul within me,
*nd distress'd my Mind so much, that I could not soon recover it,
to think what I should have done, and how I not only should
not have been able to resist them, but even should not have had
Presence of Mind enough to do what I might have done; much less,
what now after so much Consideration and Preparation I might be
able to do: Indeed, after serious thinking of these Things, I should
be very Melancholy, and sometimes it would last a great while; but
I resolv'd it at last all into Thankfulness to that Providence, which had
deliver'd me from so many unseen Dangers, and had kept me from
those Mischiefs which I could no way have been the Agent in de-
livering myself from; because I had not the least Notion of any such
Thing depending, or the least Supposition of it being possible.
This renewal a Contemplation, which often had come to my
Thoughts in former Time, when first I began to see the merciful
Dispositions of Heaven, in the Dangers we run through in this Life.
How wonderfully we are deliver'd, when we know nothing of it
How when we are in (a Quandary, as we call it) a Doubt or Hesita-
tion, whether to go this Way, or that Way, a secret Hint shall direct
us this Way, when we intended to go that Way; nay, when Sense,
our own Inclination, and perhaps Business has called to go the other
Way, yet a strange Impression upon the Mind, from we know not
what Springs, and by we know not what Power, shall overrule us to
go this Way; and.it shall afterwards appear, that had we gone that
Way which we should have gone, and even to our Imagination ought
to have gone, we should have been ruin'd and lost: Upon these,
and many like Reflections, I afterwards made it a certain Rule with
me, That whenever I found those secret Hints, or pressings of my
Mind, to doing, or not doing anything that presented; or to going
this Way, or that Way, I never failed to obey the secret Dictate;
though I knew no other Reason for it, than that such a Pressure, or
such a Hint hung upon my Mind : I could give many Examples of the
Success of this Conduct in the Course of my Life; but more espe-
cially in the latter Part of my inhabiting this unhappy Island; be-
sides many Occasions which it is very likely I might have taken
Notice of, if I had seen with the same Eyes then, that I saw with
now: But it is never too late to be wise; and I cannot but advise
all considering Men, whose Lives are attended with such extra-
ordinary Incidents as mine, or even not so extraordinary, not to
slight such secret Intimations of Providence, let them come from
what invisible Intelligence they will, that I shall not discuss, and
perhaps cannot account for; but certainly they are a Proof of the
Converse of Spirits, and the secret Communication between those
embody'd, and those unembody'd; and such a Proof as can never be
withstood : Of which I shall have Occasion to give some very remark-
able Instances, in the Remainder of my solitary Residence in this
dismal Place.
I believe the Reader of this will not think strange, if I confess that
these Anxieties, these constant Dangers I lived in, and the Concern
that was now upon me, put an End to all Invention, and to all the
Contrivances that I had laid for my future Accommodations and Con-
veniences. I had the Care of my Safety more now upon my Hands,
than that of my Food. I cared not to drive a Nail, or chop a Stick of
Wood now, for fear the Noise I should make should be heard; much
less would I fire a Gun, for the same Reason; and above all, I was
intolerably uneasy at making any Fire, lest the Smoke which is visible
at a great Distance in the Day should betray me; and for this Reason
I remov'd that Part of my Business which requir'd Fire; such as
burning of Pots, and Pipes, Grc. into my new Apartment in the
Woods, where after I had been some Time, I found to my unspeak-
able Consolation, a mere natural Cave in the Earth, which went in a
vast way, and where, I dare say, no Savage, had he been at the
Mouth of it, would be so hardy as to venture in, nor indeed, would
any Man else; but one who like me, wanted nothing so much as a
safe Retreat
The Mouth of this Hollow was at the Bottom of a great Rock where
by mere Accident, (I would say, if I did not see abundant Reason to
ascribe all such Things now to Providence) I was cutting down some
thick Branches of Trees, to make Charcoal; and before I go on, I
must observe the Reason of my making this Charcoal; which was thus:
I was afraid of making a Smoke about my Habitation, as I said
before; and yet I could not live there without baking my Bread,
cooking my Meat, cVc. so I contriv'd to bur n some Wood here, as I
had seen done in England, under Turf, until it became Chark, or dry
Coal; and then putting the Fire out, I preserv'd the Coal to carry
Home, and perform the other Services which Fire was wanting for at
Home, without Danger of Smoke.
But this is by the by: While I was cutting down some Wood here,
I perceiv'd that behind a very thick Branch of low Brushwood, or
Underwood, there was a kind of hollow Place; I was curious to look
into it, and getting with Difficulty into the Mouth of it, I found it was
pretty large; that is to say, sufficient for me to stand upright in it,
and perhaps another with me; but I must confess to you, I made
more haste out than I did in, when looking farther into the Place,
and which was perfectly dark, I saw two broad shining Eyes of some
Creature, whether Devil or Man I knew not, which twinkled like two
Stars, the dim Light from the Cave's Mouth shining directly in and
making the Reflection.
However, after some Pause, I recover^ myself, and began to call
myself a thousand Fools, and tell myself, that he that was afraid to see
the Devil, was not fit to live twenty Years in an Island all alone; and
that I durst to believe there was nothing in this Cave that was more
frightful than myself; upon this, plucking up my Courage, I took up
a great Firebrand, and in I rushed again, with the Stick flaming in my
Hand; I had not gone three Steps in, but I was almost as much
frighted as I was before; for I heard a very loud Sigh, like that of a
Man in some Pain„and it was follow'd by a broken Noise, as if of
Words half express'd, and then a deep Sigh again: I stepped back,
and was indeed struck with such a Surprise, that it put me into a cold
Sweat; and if I had had a Hat on my Head, I will not answer for it,
that my Hair might not have lifted it off. But still plucking up my
Spirits as well as I could, and encouraging myself a little with con-
sidering that the Power and Presence of God was everywhere, and
was able to protect me; upon this I stepped forward again, and by
the Light of the Firebrand, holding it up a little over my Head, I saw
lying on the Ground a most monstrous frightful old He-goat, just
making his Will, as we say, and gasping for Life, and dying indeed of
mere old Age.
I stirred him a little to see if I could get him out, and he essay'd
to get up, but was not able to raise himself; and I thought with
myself, he might even lie there; for if he had frighted me so, he
would certainly fright any of the Savages, if any of them should be so
hardy as to come in there, while he had any Life in him.
I was now recover'd from my Surprise, and began to look round
me, when I found the Cave was but very small, that is to say, it might
be about twelve Foot over, but in no manner of Shape, either round
or square, no Hands having ever been employ'd in making it, but
those of mere Nature: I obseiVd also, that there was a Place at the
farther Side of it, that went in farther, but was so low, that it requir'd
me to creep upon my Hands and Knees to go into it, and whither I
went I knew not; so having no Candle, I gave it over for some Time;
but resolv'd to come again the next Day, provided with Candles, and
a Tinder-box, which I had made of the Lock of one of the Muskets,
with some Wildfire in the Pan.
Accordingly, the next Day I came provided with six large Candles
of my own making; for I made very good Candles now of Goat's
Tallow; and going into this low Place, I was oblig'd to creep upon
KUIU.^ON i.ivLbO:; DISCUVEKS A DEUCHTFUL CAVITY.—P. 159
all Fours, as I have said, almost ten Yards; which by the Way, I
thought was a Venture bold enough, considering that I knew not how
far it might go, nor what was beyond it When-1 was got through
the Strait, I found the Roof rose higher up, I believe near twenty
Foot; but never was such a glorious Sight seen in the Island, I dare
say, as it was, to look round the Sides and Roof of this Vault, or
Cave; the Walls reflected a hundred thousand Lights to me from my
two Candles; what it was in the Rock, whether Diamonds, or any other
precious Stones, or Gold, which I rather suppos'd it to be, I knew not
The Place I was in, was a most delightful Cavity, or Grotto, of its
kind, as could be expected, though perfectly dark; the Floor was
dry and level, and had a sort of small loose Gravel upon it, so that
there was no nauseous or venomous Creature to be seen, neither was
there any damp or wet on the Sides or Roof: The only Difficulty
in it was the Entrance, which however, as it was a Place of Security,
and such a Retreat as I wanted, I thought that was a Convenience;
so that I was really rejoic'd at the Discovery, and resolv'd without
any Delay, to bring some of those Things which I was most anxious
about, to this Place; particularly, I resolv'd to bring hither my
Magazine of Powder, and all my spare Arms, viz. Two Fowling-
Pieces, for I had three in all; and three Muskets, for of them I had
eight in all; so I kept at my Castle only five, which stood ready
mounted like Pieces of Cannon, on my outmost Fence; and were
ready also to take out upon any Expedition.
Upon this Occasion of removing my Ammunition, I took Occasion
to open the Ban el of Powder which I took up out of the Sea, and
which had been wet; and I found that the Water had penetrated
about three or four Inches into the Powder, on every Side, which
caking and growing hard, had preserv'd the inside like a Kernel in a
Shell; so that I had near sixty Pound of very good Powder in the
Centre of the Cask, and this was an agreeable Discovery to me at
that Time; so I carried all away thither, never keeping above two or
three Pound of Powder with me in my Castle, for fear of a Surprise
of any Kind: I also carried thither all the Lead I had left for Bullets.
I fancied myself now like one of the ancient Giants, which are
said to live in Caves, and Holes, in the Rocks, where none could come
at them; for I persuaded myself while I was here, if five hundred
Savages were to hunt me, they could never find me out; or if they
did. they would not venture to attack me here.
The old Goat who I found expiring, died in the Mouth of the Cave,
6ie next Day after I made this Discovery; and I found it much easier
to dig a great Hole there, and throw him in, and cover him with
Earth, than to drag him out; so I interr'd him there, to prevent the
9ffence to my Nose.
I was now in my twenty-third Year of Residence in this Island, and
was so naturalis'd to the Place, and to the Manner of Living, that
could I have but enjoy'd the Certainty that no Savages would come
to the Place to disturb me, I could have been content to have capi-
tulated for spending the rest of my Time there, even to the last Mo-
ment, until I had laid me down and died, like the old Goat in the
Cave. I had also arriv'd to some little Diversions and Amusements,
which made the Time pass more pleasantly with me a great deal, than
it did before; as First, I had taught my Poll, as I noted before, to
speak; and he did it so familiarly, and talked so articulately and plain,
that it was very pleasant to me; and he lived with me no less than
six-and-twenty Years: How long he might live afterwards, I know
not; though I know they have a Notion in the Brasils, that they live
a hundred Years; perhaps poor Poll may be alive there still, calling
after Poor Robin Crusoe, to this Day. I wish no Englishman the ill
Luck to come there and hear him; but if he did, he would certainly
believe it was the Devil. My Dog was a very pleasant and loving
Companion to me, for no less than sixteen Years of my Time, and
then died, of mere old Age; as for my Cats, they multiplied, as I have
observ'd, to that Degree, that I was oblig'd to shoot several of them
at first, to keep them from devouring me and all I had; but at lengthy
when the two old Ones I brought with me were gone, and after some
Time continually driving them from me, and letting them have no
Provision with me, they all ran wild into the Woods, except two or
three Favourites, which I kept tame; and whose Young when they
had any, I always drowned; and these were part of my Family:
Besides these, I always kept two or three household Kids about me,
who I taught to feed out of my Hand; and I had two more Parrots
which talked pretty well, and would all call Robin Crusoe; but none
like my first; nor indeed did I take the Pains with any of them that
I had done with him. I had also several tame Sea-Fowls, whose
Names I know not, who I caught upon the Shore, and cut their
Wings; and the little Stakes which I had planted before my Castle
Wall being now ($rown up to a good thick Grove, these Fowls all lived
among these low Trees, and bred there, which was very agreeable to
me; so that, as I said above, I began to be very well contented with
the Life I led, if it might but have been secur'd from the dread of
the Savages.
But it was otherwise directed; and it may not be amiss for all
People who shall meet with my Story, to make this just Observation
from it, viz. How frequently in the Course of our Lives, the Evil
which in itself we seek most to shun, and which when we are falleq
into it, is the most dreadful to us, is oftentimes the very Means or
Door of our Deliverance, by which alone we can be raised again from
the Affliction we are fallen into. I could give many Examples of this
in the Course of my unaccountable Life; but in nothing was it more
particularly remarkable, than in the Circumstances of my last Years
of solitary Residence in this Island.
It was now the Month of December, as I said above, in my twenty-
third Year; and this being the Southern Solstice, for Winter I cannot
call it, was the particular Time of my Harvest, and requir'd my being
pretty much abroad in the Fields, when going out pretty early in the
Morning, even before it was thorough Daylight, I was surpris'd with
seeing a Light of some Fire upon the Shore, at a Distance from me,
of about two Mjle towards the End of the Island, where I had
observ'd some Savages had been as before; but not on the other
Side; but to my great Affliction, it was on my Side of the Island.
I was indeed terribly surpris'd at the Sight, and stepped short
within my Grove, not daring to go out, least I might be surpris'd; and
yet I had no more Peace within, from the Apprehensions I had, that
if these Savages in rambling over the Island, should find my Corn
standing, or cut, or any of my Works and Improvements, they would
immediately conclude, that there were People in the Place, and would
then never give over till they had found me out: In this Extremity
I went back directly to my Castle, pulled up the Ladder after me, and
made all Things without look as wild and natural as I could.
Then I prepar'd myself within, putting myself in a Posture of
Defence; I loaded all my Cannon, as I called them; that is to say,
my Muskets, which were mounted upon my new Fortification, and all
my Pistols, and resoVd to defend myself to the last Gasp, not for-
getting seriously to commend myself to the Divine Protection, and
earnestly to pray to God to deliver me out of the Hands of the
Barbarians; and in this Posture I continu'd about two Hours; but
ADVENTURES OP
began to be mighty impatient for Intelligence abroad, for I had no
Spies to send out
After sitting a while longer, and musing what I should do in this
Case, I was not able to bear sitting in Ignorance any longer; so
setting up my Ladder to the Side of the Hill, where there was a flat
Place, as I observ'd before, and then pulling the Ladder up after me,
I set it up again, and mounted to the Top of the Hill; and pulling
out my Perspective-Glass, which I had taken on Purpose, I laid me
down flat on my Belly, on the Ground, and began to look for the
Place; I presently found there was no less than nine naked Savages,
sitting round a small Fire, they had made, not to warm them; for they
had no need of that, the Weather being extreme hot; but as I
tuppos'd, to dress some of their barbarous Diet of human Flesh,

which they had brought with them, whether alive or dead I ccuid
not know.
They had two Canoes with them, which they had hauled up upon
the Shore; and as it was then Tide of Ebb, they seemed to me to
wait for the Return of the Flood, to go away again; it is not easy to
imagine what Confusion this Sight put me into, especially seeing them
come on my Side the Island, and so near me too; but when 1
observ'd their coming mu»t be always with the Current of the Ebb, I
began afterwards to be more sedate in my Mind, being satisfy'd that I
might go abroad with Safety all the Time of the Tide of Flood, if th«j
were not on Shore before: And having made this Observation, I
-r«»nt abroad about my Harvest-Work with the more Composure
As I expected, so it proved; for as soon as the Tide made to the
Westward, I saw them all take Boat, and row (or paddle, as we caJ
it) all away: I should have observ'd that for an Hour and more before
they went off, they went to dancing, and I could easily discern their
Postures, and Gestures, by my Glasses: I could not perceive by my
nicest Observation, but that they were stark naked, and had not the
least Covering upon them; but whether they were Men or Women,
that I could not distinguish.
As soon as I saw them shipped, and gone, I took two Guns upon
Kiy Shoulders, and two Pistols at my Girdle, and my great Sword by
my Side, without a Scabbard, and with all the Speed I was able to
make, I went away to the Hill, where I had discover'd the first Ap-
pearance of all; and as soon as I gat thither, which was not less than
two hours, (for I could not go apace, being so loaded with Arms as I
was) I perceiv'd there had been three Canoes more of Savages on
that Place; and looking out farther, I saw they were all at Sea
together, and making over for the Main.
This was a dreadful Sight to me, especially when going down to the
Shore, I could see the Marks of Horror, which the dismal Work they
had been about had left behind it, viz. The Blood, the Bones, and
Part of the Flesh of human Bodies, eaten and devour'd by those
Wretches, with Merriment and Sport: I was so filled with Indigna-
tion at the Sight, that I began now to premeditate the Destruction of
the next that I saw there, let them be who or how many soever.
It seemed evident to me, that the Visits which they thus make to
this Island, are not very frequent; for it was above fifteen Months
before any more of them came on Shore there again ; that is to say, I
neither saw them, or any Footsteps, or Signals of them, in all that
Time; for as to the rainy Seasons, then they are sure not to come
abroad, at least not so far; yet all this while I lived uncomfortably,
by Reason of the constant Apprehensions I was in of their coming
upon me by Surprise; from whence I observe, that the Expectation
of Evil is more bitter than the Suffering, especially if there is no
room to shake off that Expectation, or those Apprehensions.
During all this Time, I was in the murdering Humour; and took
up most of my Hours, which should have been better employ'd, in
contriving how to circumvent, and fall upon them, the very next Time
I should see them; especially if they should be divided, as they were
the last Time, into two Parties; nor did I consider at all, that if I
killed one Party, suppose Ten, or a Dozen, I was still the next Day,
or Week, or Month, to kill another, and so another, even ad infinitum,
till I should be at length no less a Murderer than they were in being
Man-eaters; and perhaps much more so.
I spent my Days now in great Perplexity, and Anxiety of Mind,
expecting that I should one Day or other fall into the Hands of these
merciless Creatures; and if I did at any Time venture abroad, it was
not without looking round me with the greatest Care and Caution
imaginable; and now I found to my great Comfort, how happy it was
that I provided for a tame Flock or Herd of Goats; for I durst not
upon any Account fire my Gun, especially near that Side of the
Island where they usually came, lest I should alarm the Savages;
and if they had fled from me now, I was sure to have them come
back again, with perhaps two or three hundred Canoa with them, in
a few Days, and then I knew what to expect
However, I wore out a Year and three Months more, before I ever
saw any more of the Savages, and then I found them again, as I shall
soon observe. It is true, they might have been there once, or twice;
but either they made no Stay, or at lest I did not hear them; but in
the Month of May, as near as I could calculate, and in my four-an&
wentieth Year, I had a very strange Encounter with them, of which
in its Place.
The Perturbation of my Mind, during this fifteen or sixteen Months'
Interval, was very great; I slept unquiet, dreamed always frightful
Dreams, and often started out of my Sleep in the Night: In the Day
great Troubles overwhelm'd my Mind, and in the Night I dreamed
often of killing the Savages, and of the Reasons why I might justify
the doing of it; but to waive all this for a while, it was in the middle
of May, on the sixteenth Day I think, as well as my poor wooden
Calendar would reckon; for I marked all upon the Post still; I say,
it was the sixteenth of May, that it blew a very great Storm of Wind,
all Day, with a great deal of Lightning, and Thunder, and a very foul
Night it was after it; I know not what was the particular Occasion of
it; but as I was reading in the Bible, and taken up with very serious
Thoughts about my present Condition, I was surpris'd with a Noise
of a Gun, as I thought fired at Sea.
This was to be sure a Surprise of a quite different Nature from any
I had met with before; for the Notions this put into my Thoughts,
ircre quite of another kind . I started up in the greatest haste im-
aginable, and in a trice clapped my Ladder to the middle Place ol
the Rock, and pulled it after me, and mounting it the second Time,
got to the Top of the Hill, the very Moment, that a Flash of Fire bid
me listen for a second Gun, which accordingly, in about half a Minute,
I heard, and by the sound, knew that it was from that Part of the Sea
where I was driven down the Current in my Boat
I immediately consider'd that this must be some Ship in Distress
and that they had some Comrade, or some other Ship in Company,
and fired these Guns for Signals of Distress, and to obtain Help: I
had this Presence of Mind at that Minute, as to think that though I
could not help them, it may be they might help me; so I brought
together all the dry Wood I could get at hand, and making a good
handsome Pile, I set it on Fire upon the Hill; the Wood was dry,
and blazed freely; and though the Wind blew very hard, yet it burnt
fairly out; that I was certain, if there was any such Tning as a Ship,
they must needs see it, and no doubt they did; for as soon as ever
my Fire blazed up, I heard another Gun, and after that several others,
all from the same Quarter. I plied my Fire all Night long, until Day
broke; and when it was broad Day, and the Air cleared up, I saw
something at a great Distance at Sea, full East of the Island, whether
a Sail, or a Hull, I could not distinguish, no not with my Glasses, the
Distance was so great, and the Weather still something hazy also;
at least it was so out at Sea.
I looked frequently at it all that Day, and soon perceiv'd that it
did not move; so I presently concluded, that it was a Ship at an Anchor,
and being eager, you may be sure, to be satisfied, I took my Gun in
my Hand, and run toward the South Side of the Island, to the Rocks
where I had formerly been carried away with the Current, and getting
up there, the Weather by this Time being perfectly clear, I could
plainly see to my great Sorrow, the Wreck of a Ship cast away in the
. Night, upon those concealed Rocks which I found, when I was out
in my Boat; and which Rocks, as they checked the Violence of the
Stream, and made a kind of Counter-stream, or Eddy, were the
Occasion of my recovering from the most desperate hopeless Condi-
tion that ever I had been in in all my Life.
Thus what is one Man's Safety, is another Man's Destruction; for
it seems these Men, whoever they were, being out of their Knowledge,
and the Rocks being wholly under Water, had been driven upon them
in the Night, the Wind blowing hard at E. and E.N.E.! Had they
seen the Island, as I must necessarily suppose thej did not, they
must, as I thought, have endeavour^ to have saved themselves on
Shore by the Help of their Boat; but their firing of Guns for Help,
especially when they saw, as I imagin'd, my Fire, filled me with many
Thoughts; First, I imagin'd that upon seeing my Light, they might
have put themselves into their Boat, and have endeavour'd to make
the Shore; but that the Sea going very high, they might have been
cast away; other Times I imagin'd, that they might have lost their
Boat before, as might be the Case many Ways; as particularly by
the Breaking of the Sea upon their Ship, which many Times obliges
Men to stave, or take in Pieces their Boat; and sometimes to throw
it overboard with their own Hands: Other Times I imagin'd, they
had some other Ship, or Ships in Company, who upon the Signals of
Distress they had made, had taken them up, and carried them off:
Other whiles I fancied, they were all gone off to Sea in their Boat,
and being hurried away by the Current that I had been formerly in,
were carried out into the great Ocean, where there was nothing but
Misery and Perishing; and that perhaps they might by this Time
think of Starving, and of being in a Condition to eat one another.
As all these were but Conjectures at best; so in the Condition I was
in, I could do no more than look on upon the Misery of the poor
Men, and pity them, which had still this good Effect on my Side, that
it gave me more and more Cause to give Thanks to God who had so
happily and comfortably provided for me in my desolate Condition;
and that of two Ships' Companies who were now cast away upon this
part of the World, not one Life should be spared but mine: I learned
here again to observe, that it is very rare that the Providence of God
casts us into any Condition of Life so low, or any Misery so great,
but we may see something or other to be thankful for; and may see
others in worse Circumstances than our own.
Such ceitainly was the Case of these Men, of whom I could not so
much as see room to suppose any of them were saved; nothing
could make it rational, so much as to wish, or expect that they did not
all perish there; except the Possibility only of their being taken up by
another Ship in Company, and this was but mere Possibility indeed;
for I saw not the least Signal or Appearance of any such Thing.
I cannot explain by any possible Energy of Words, what a strange
longing or hankering of Desires I felt in my Soul upon this Sight;
breaking out sometimes thus; O that there had been but one or two;
nay, or but one Soul saved out of this Ship, to have escap'd to me,
that I might but have had one Companion, one Fellow Creature to
have spoken to me, and to have convers'd with! In all the Time of
my solitary Life, I never felt so earnest, so strong a Desire after the
Society of my Fellow Creatures, or so deep a Regret at the want of
it
There are some secret moving Springs in the Affections, which
when they are set a going by some Object in view, or be it some
Object, though not in view, yet rendered present to the Mind by the
Power of Imagination, that Motion carries out the Soul by its Impe-
tuosity to such violent eager Embracings of the Object, that the Absence
of it is insupportable.
Such were these earnest Wishings, That but one Man had been
saved! O that it had been but One / I believe I repeated the Words
O that it had been but One IA thousand Times; and the Desires were
so moved by it, that when I spoke the Words, my Hands would
clinch together, and my Fingers press the Palms of my Hands, that
if I had had any soft Thing in my Hand, it would have crushed it
involuntarily; and my Teeth in my Head would strike together, and
set against one another so strong, that for some Time I could not
port them again.
Let the Naturalists explain these Things, and the Reason and
Manner of them; all I can say to them is, to describe the Fact, which
was even surprising to me when I found it; though I knew not from
what it should proceed; it was doubtless the effect of ardent Wishes,
and of strong Ideas formed in my Mind, realizing the Comfort, which
the Conversation of one of my Fellow-Christians would have been
to me.
But it was not to be; either their Fate, or mine, or both, forbid it;
lor till the last Year of my being on this Island, I never knew whether
any were saved out of that Ship or no; and had only the Affliction
some Days after, to see the Corpse of a drowned Boy come on Shore,
at the End of the Island which was next the Shipwreck: He had on
no Clothes, but a Seaman's Waistcoat, a Pair of open knee'd Linen
Drawers, and a blue Linen Shirt; but nothing to direct me so much
as to guess what Nation he was of: He had nothing in his Pocket,
but two Pieces of Eight, and a Tobacco Pipe; the last was to me of
ten times more value than the first
It was now calm, and I had a great mind to venture out in my
o
Boat, to this Wreck; not doubting but I might find something on
board, that might be useful to me; but that did not altogether press
me so much, as the Possibility that there might be yet some living
Creature on board, whose Life I might not only save, but might by
saving that Life, comfort my own to the last Degree; and this Thought
clung so to my Heart, that I could not be quiet, Night or Day, but
I must venture out in my Boat on board this Wreck; and committing
the rest to God's Providence, I thought the Impression was so strong
upon my Mind, that it could not be resisted, that it must come from
some invisible Direction, and that I should be wanting to myself if I
did not go.
Under the Power of this Impression, I hasten'd back to my Castle,
prepar'd everything for my Voyage, took a Quantity of Bread, a great
Pot for fresh Water, a Compass to steer by, a Bottle of Rum; for I
had still a great deal of that left; a Basket full of Raisins: And thus
loading myself with everything necessary, I wen/; down to my Boat,
got the Water out of her, and got her afloat, loaded all my Cargo in
her, and then went Home again for more; my second Cargo was a
great Bag full of Rice, the Umbrella to set up over my Head for
Shade, another large Pot full of fresh Water, and about two Dozen of
my small Loaves, or Barley Cakes, more than before, with a Bottle of
Goat's Milk, and a Cheese; all which, with great Labour and Sweat,
I brought to my Boat; and praying to God to direct my Voyage, I
put out, and Rowing or Paddling the Canoe along the Shore, I came
at last to the utmost Point of the Island on that Side (viz.) N.E.
And now I was to launch out into the Ocean, and either to venture,
or not to venture. I looked on the rapid Currents which ran con-
stantly on both Sides of the Island, at a Distance, and which were
very terrible to me, from the Remembrance of the Hazard I had been
in before, and my Heart began to fail me; for I foresaw that if I was
driven in to either of those Currents, I should be carried a vast Way
out to Sea, and perhaps out of my Reach, or Sight of the Island
again; and that then, as my Boat was but small, if any little Gale of
Wind should rise, I should be inevitably lost
These Thoughts so oppress'd my Mind, that I began to give over
my Enterprise, and having hauled my Boat into a little Creek on the
Shore, I stepped out, and sat me down upon a little rising hit of
Ground, very pensive and anxious, between Fear and Desire about
my Voyage; when as I was musing, I could perceive that the Tide
was turned, and the Flood come on, upon which my going was for so
many Hours impracticable; upon this presently it occurr'd to me,
that I should go up to the highest Piece of Ground I could find, and
observe, if I could, how the Sets of the Tide, or Currents lay, wheu
the Hood came in, that I might judge whether if I was driven one
way out, I might not expect to be driven another way home, with
the same Rapidness of the Currents : This Thought was no sooner in
my Head, but I cast my eye upon a little Hill, which sufficiently
overlook'd the Sea both ways, and from whence I had a clear view,
of the Currents, or Sets of the Tide, and which way I was to guide
myself in my Return; here I found, that as the Current of the Ebb
set out close by the South Point of the Island; so the Current of the

flood set m close by the Shore of the North Side, and that I had
nothing to do but to keep to the North of the Island in my Return,
and I should do well enough.
Encourag'd with this Observation, I resolv'd the next Morning to
set out with the first of the Tide; and reposing myself for the Night
in the Canoe, under ihe great Watch-coat, I mention'd, I launched
out: I made first a little out to Sea full North, till I began to feel the
Benefit of the Current, which set Eastward, and which carried me at
a great rate, and yet did not so hurry me as the Southern Side
Current had done before, and so as to take from me all Government
of the Boat: but having a strong Steerage with my Paddle, I went at
a great rate, directly for the Wreck, and in less than two Hours I
came up to it
It was a dismal Sight to look at: The Ship, which by its building
was Spanish, stuck fast, jammed in between two Rocks ; all the Stern
and Quarter of her was beaten to pieces, with the Sea; and as her
Forecastle, which stuck in the Rocks, had run on with great Violence,
her Mainmast and Foremast were brought by the Board; that is to
say, broken short off; but her Bowsprit was sound, and the Head
and Bow appear'd firm; when I came close to her, a Dog appear'd
upon her, who seeing me coming, yelped and cried; and as soon as
I called him, jumped into the Sea, to come to me, and I took him
into the Boat; but found him almost dead for Hunger and Thirst: I
gave him a Cake of my Bread, and he eat it like a ravenous Wolf,
that had been starving a Fortnight in the Snow: I then gave the poor
Creature some fresh Water, with which, if I would have let him, he
would have burst himself.
After this I went on board; but the first Sight I met with, was two
Men drowncd, in the Cook-room, or Forecastle of the Ship, with their
Arms fast about one another: I concluded, as is indeed probable,
that when the Ship struck, it being in a Storm, the Sea broke so high,
and so continually over her, that the Men were not able to bear it,
and were strangled with the constant rushing in of the Water, as much
as it they had been under Water. Besides the Dog, there was nothing
/eft in the Ship that had Life; nor any Goods that I could see, but
what were spoiled by the Water. There were some Casks of Liquor,
whether Wine or Brandy, I knew not, which lay lower in the Hold;
and which, the Water being ebbed out, I could see; but they were
too big to meddle with: I saw several Chests, which I believ'd be-
long'd to some of the Seamen; and I got two of them into the Boat
without examining what was in them.
Had the Stern of the Ship been fixed, and the Forepart broken off,
I am persuaded I might have made a good Voyage; for by what I
found in these two Chests, I had room to suppose, the Ship had a
gieat deal of Wealth on board; and if I may guess by the Course she
steered, she must have been bound from the Buenos Ayres, or the
Rio de la Plata, in the South Part of America, beyond the Brasils, to
the Havana, in the Gulf of Mexico, and so perhaps to Spain: She
had, no doubt, a great Treasure in her; but of no use at that time
to anybody; and what became of the rest of her People, I then
knew not
I found besides these Chests, a little Cask full of Liquor, of about
twenty Gallons, which I got into my Boat, with much Difficulty;
there were several Muskets in a Cabin, and a great Powder-horn, with
about 4 Pounds of Powder in it; as for the Muskets, I had no occasion
for them; so I left them, but took the Powder-horn: I took a Fire
Shovel and Tongs, which I wanted extremely; as also two little Brass
Kettles, a Copper Pot to make Chocolate, and a Gridiron; and with
this Cargo, and the Dog, I came away, the Tide beginning to make
home again; and the same Evening, about an Hour within Night, I
reached the Island again, weary and fatigu'd to the last Degree.
I repos'd that Night in the Boat, and in the Morning I resolved to
karbour what I had gotten in my new Cave, not to carry it home to
my Castle. After refreshing myself, I got all my Cargo on Shore,
and began to examine the Particulars: The Cask of Liquor I found
to be a kind of Rum, but not such as we had at the Brasils; and in
a Word, not at all good; but when I came to open the Chests, I
found several Things, of great use to me: For Example, I found in
one, a fine Case of Bottles, of an extraordinary kind, and filled with
Cordial Waters, fine, and very good; the Bottles held about three
pints each, and were tipped with Silver: I found two Pots of very
good Succades, or Sweetmeats, so fastened also on top, that the Salt
Water had not hurt them; and two more of the same, which the
IVater had spoiled: I found some very good Shirts, which were very
welcome to me; and about a dozen and half of Linen white Handker-
chiefs, and colour'd Neckcloths; the former were also very welcome,
being exceeding refreshing to wipe my Face in a hot Day; besides
this, when I came to the Till in the Chest, I found there three great
Bags of Pieces of Eight, which held about eleven hundred Pieces in
all; and in one of them, wrapt up in a Paper, six Doubloons of Gold,
and some small Bars or Wedges of Gold; I suppose they might all
weigh near a Pound.
The other Chest I found had some Clothes in it, but of little Value;
but by the Circumstances it must have belong'd to the Gunner's Mate;
though there was no Powder in it; but about two Pound of fine glazed
Powder, in three small Flasks, kept, I suppose, for charging their
Fowling Pieces on occasion: Upon the whole, I got very little by
this Voyage, that was of any use to me; for as to the Money, I had
no manner of occasion for it: It was to me as the Dirt under mj
Feet; and I would have given it all for three or four pair of English
Shoes and Stockings, which were Things I greatly wanted, but r.ad
not had on my Feet now for many Years: I had indeed gotten
two pair of Shoes now, which I took off of the Feet of the two
drowned Men, who I saw in the Wreck; and I found two pair more
in one of the Chests, which were very welcome to me; but they were
not like our English Shoes, either for Ease, or Service; being rather
what we call Pumps, than Shoes: I found in this Seaman's Chest
about fifty Pieces of Eight in Royals, but no Gold; I suppose this
belong'd to a poorer Man than the other, which seemed to belong to
some Officer.
Well, however, I lugged this Money home to my Cave, and laid it
up, as I had done that before, which I brought from our own Ship;
but it was great Pity as I said, that the other Part of this Ship had
not come to my Share; for I am satisfy'd I might have loaded my
Canoe several Times over with Money, which if I had ever escap'd
to England, would have lain here safe enough, till I might have come
again and fetched it
Having now brought all my Things on Shore, and secur'd them, I
went back to my Boat, and rowed, or paddled her along the Shore, to
her old Harbour, where I laid her up, and made the best of my way
to my old Habitation, where I found everything safe and quiet; so
I began to repose myself, live after my old fashion, and lake care of
my Family Affairs; and for a while, I lived easy enough; only that I
was more vigilant than I used to be, looked out oftener, and did not
go abroad so much; and if at any time I did stir with any Freedom,
it was always to the East Part of the Island, where I was pretty well
satisfy'd the Savages never came, and where I could go without so
many Precautions, and such a Load of Arms and Ammunition, as I
always carried with me, if I went the other way.
I lived in this Condition near two Years more; but my unlucky
Head, that was always to let me know it was born to make my Body
miserable, was all this two Years filled with Projects and Designs,
how, if it were possible, I might get away from this Island; for some-
times I was for making another Voyage to the Wreck, though my
Reason told me that there was nothing left there, worth the Hazard
of my Voyage: Sometimes for a Ramble one way, sometimes another;
and I believe verily, if I had had the Boat that I went from Sallee in,
I should have ventur'd to Sea, bound anywhere, I knew not whither.
I had been in all my Circumstances a Memento to those who are
touched with the general Plague of Mankind, whence, for ought I
know, one half of their Miseries flow; I mean, that of not being
satisfy'd with the Station wherein God and Nature has placed them;
for not to look back upon my primitive Condition, and the excellent
Advice of my Father, the Opposition to which, was, as I may call it,
my Original Sin; my subsequent Mistakes of the same kind had
been the Means of my coming into this miserable Condition; for had
that Providence, which so happily had seated me at the Brasils, as a
Planter, blessed me with confin'd Desires, and I could have been
contented to have gone on gradually, I might have been by this
Time, / mean, in the Time of my being in this Island, one of the
most considerable Planters in the Brasils; nay, I am persuaded, that
by the Improvements I had made, in that little Time I lived there, and
the Increase I should probably have made, if I had stayed, I might
have been worth an hundred thousand Moidores; and what Business
had I to leave a settled Fortune, a well-stocked Plantation, improving
and increasing, to turn Super-Cargo to Guinea, to fetch Negroes;
when Patience and Time would have so increas'd our Stock at Home,
that we could have bought them at our own Door, from those whose
Business it was to fetch them; and though it had cost us something
more, yet the Difference of that Price was by no Means worth saving,
at so great a Hazard.
But as this is ordinarily the Fate of young Heads, so Reflection
upon the Folly of it, is as ordinarily the Exercise of more Years, or of
the dear-bought Experience of Time; and so it was with me now;
and yet so deep had the Mistake taken root in my Temper, that I
could not satisfy myself in my Station, but was continually poring
upon the Means, and Possibility of my Escape from this Place; and
that I may with the greater Pleasure to the Reader, bring on the
remaining Part of my Story, it may not be improper, to give some
Account of my first Conceptions on the Subject of this foolish Scheme,
for my Escape; and how, and upon what Foundation I acted.
I am now to be suppos'd retir'd into my Castle, after my late
Voyage to the Wreck, my Frigate laid up, and secur'd under Water,
as usual, and my Condition restor'd to what it was before: I had
more Wealth indeed than I had before, but was not at all the richer;
for I had no more use for it, than the Indians of Peru had, before the
Spaniards tame there.
It was flue of the Nights in the rainy Season in March, the four-and-
twentieth Vear of my first setting Foot in this Island of Solitariness;
I was lying in my Bed, or Hammock, awake, very well in Health,
had no Pain, no Distemper, no Uneasiness of Body; no, nor any
Uneasiness of Mind, more than ordinary; but could by no means
close my Eyes; that is, so as to sleep; no, not a Wink all Night
long, otherwise that as follows:
It is as impossible, as needless, to set down the innumerable Crowd
of Thoughts that whirled through that great throughfare of the Brain,
the Memory, in this Night's Time: I ran over the whole History of
my Life in Miniature, or by Abridgment, as I may call it, to my
coming to this Island; and also of the Part of my Life, since I came
to this Island. In my Reflections upon the State of my Case, since
I came on Shore on this Island, I was comparing the happy Posture
of my Affairs, in the first Years of my Habitation here, compar'd to
the Life of Anxiety, Fear and Care, which I had lived ever since I
had seen the Print of a Foot in the Sand; not that I did not believe
the Savages had frequented the Island even all the while, and might
have been several Hundreds of them at Times on Shore there; but
I had never known it, and was incapable of any Apprehensions about
it; my Satisfaction was perfect, though my Danger was the same;
and I was as happy in not knowing my Danger, as if I had never
really been expos'd to it: This furnish'd my Thoughts with many
very profitable Reflections, and particularly this one, How infinitely
Good that Providence is, which has provided in its Government of
Mankind, such narrow bounds to his Sight and Knowledge of Things,
and though he walks in the midst of so many thousand Dangers, the
Sight of which, if discover'd to him, would distract his Mind, and
sink his Spirits; he is kept serene, and calm, by having the Events of
Things hid from his Eyes, and knowing nothing of the Dangers which
surround him.
After these Thoughts had for some Time entertain'd me, I came ti
reflect seriously upon the real Danger I had been in, for so many
Years, in this very Island; and how I had walked about in the
greatest Security, and with all possible Tranquillity; even when
perhaps nothing but a Brow of a Hill, a great Tree, or the Casual
Approach of Night, had been between me and the worst kind of
Destruction, viz. That of falling into the Hands of Cannibals, and
Savages, who would have seized on me with the same View, as I did
of a Goat, or a Turtle; and have thought it no more a Crime to kill
and devour me, than I did of a Pigeon, or Curlew: I would unjustly
dander myself, if I should say I was notsincerely thankful to my great
Preserver, to whose singular Protection I acknowledg'd, with great
Humility, that all these unknown Deliverances were due; and with-
out which, I must inevitably have fallen into their merciless Hands.
When these Thoughts were over, my Head was for some time taken
np in considering the Nature of these wretched Creatures; I mean,
the Savages; and how it came to pass in the World, that the wise
Governor of all Things should give up any of his Creatures to such
Inhumanity; nay, to something so much below, even Brutality itself
as to devour its own kind; but as this ended in some (at that Time
fruitless) Speculations, it occurr'd to me to inquire, what Part of the
World these Wretches lived in; how tar off the Coast was from whence
they came; what they ventur'd over so far from home for; what
kind of Boats they had; and why I might not order myself, and my
Business so, that I might be as able to go over thither, as they were
to come to me.
I never so much as troubled myself, to consider what I should do
with myself, when I came thither; what would become of me, if I fell
into the Hands of the Savages; or how I should escape from them,
if they attempted me; no, nor so much as how it was possible for me
to reach the Coast, and not be attempted by some or other of them,
without any Possibility of delivering myself; and if I should not fall
into their Hands, what I should do for Provision, or whither I should
bend my Course; none of these Thoughts, I say, so much as came
in my way; but my Mind was wholly bent upon the Notion of my
passing over in my Boat, to the Main Land: I looked back upon my
present Condition, as the most miserable that could possibly be, that
I was not able to throw myself into anything but Death, that could be
called worse; that if I reached the Shore of the Main, I might perhaps
meet with Relief, or I might coast along, as I did on the Shore of
Africa, till I came to some inhabited Country, and where I might
find some Relief; and after all perhaps, I might fall in with some
Christian Ship, that might take me in; and if the worse came to the
worst, I could but die, which would put an end to all these Miseries
at once. Pray note, all this was the fruit of a disturb'd Mind, an
impatient Temper, made as it were desperate by the long Continuance
of my Troubles, and the Disappointments I had met in the Wreck, I had
been on board of; and where I had been so near the obtaining what I
so earnestly longed for, viz. Somebody to spea> to, and to learn some
Knowledge from of the Place where I was, and of the probable Means
of my Deliverance; I say, I was agitated wholly by these Thoughts:
All my Calm of Mind in my Resignation to Providence, and waiting
the Issue of the Dispositions of Heaven, seemed to be suspended;
and I had, as it were, no Power to turn my Thoughts to anything,
but to the Project of a Voyage to the Main, which came upon me
with such Force, and such an Impetuosity of Desire, that it was not
to be resisted
When this had agitated my Thoughts for two Hours, or more, with
such Violence, that it set my very Blood into a Ferment, and my
Pulse beat as high as if I had been in a Fever, merely with the ex-
traordinary Fervour of my Mind about it; Nature, as if I had been
fatigued and exhausted with the very Thought of it, threw me into a
sound Sleep; one would have thought, I should have dreamed of it:
But I did not, nor of anything relating to it; but I dreamed, that as
I was going out in the Morning as usual from my Castle, I saw upon
the Shore, two Canoes, and eleven Savages coming to Land, and that
they brought with them another Savage, who they were going to kill,
in Order to eat him; when on a sudden, the Savage, that they were
going to kill, jumped away, and ran for his Life; and I thought in my
Sleep, that he came running into my little thick Grove, before my
Fortification, to hide himself; and that I seeing him alone, and not
perceiving that the other sought him that Way, showed myself to him,
and smiling upon him, encourag'd him; that he kneeled down to me,
seeming to pray me to assist him; upon which I showed my Ladder,
made him go up, and carried him into my Cave, and he became my
Servant; and that as soon as I had gotten this Man, I said to myself,
now I may certainly venture to the main Land; for this Fellow will
serve me as a Pilot, and will tell me what to do, and whither to go
for Provisions; and whither not to go for fear of being devoured,
what Places to venture into, and what to escape: I waked with this
Thought, and was under such inexpressible Impressions of Joy, at the
Prospect of my Escape in my Dream, that the Disappointments which
I felt upon coming to myself, and finding it was no more than a Dream,
were equally extravagant the other Way, and threw me into a very
great Dejection of Spirit
Upon this however, I made this Conclusion, that my only Way
to go about an Attempt for an Escape, was, if possible, to get a
Savage into my Possession j and if possible, it should be one of theii
Prisoners, who they had condemn'd to be eaten, and sfcoula bring
thither to kill; but these Thoughts still were attended with this
Difficulty, that it .was impossible to effect this, without attacking a
whole Caravan of them, and killing them all; and this was not only
a very desperate Attempt, and might miscarry; but on the other Hand,
I had greatly scrupled the Lawfulness of it to me; and my Heart
trembled at the thoughts of shedding so much Blood, though it was
for my Deliverance. I need not repeat the Arguments which occurr'd
to me against this, they being the same inention'd before; but though
I had other Reasons to offer now, (viz.) that those Men were Enemiei
to my Life, and would devour me, if they could; that it was Self
preservation in the highest Degree, to deliver myself from this Death
of a Life, and was acting in my own Defence, as much as if they
were actually assaulting me, and the like. I say, though these Things
argued for it, yet the Thoughts of shedding Human Blood for my
Deliverance, were very Terrible to me, and such as I could by no
Means reconcile myself to, a great while.
However at last, after many secret Disputes with myself, and after
great Perplexities about it, for all these Arguments one Way and
another struggl'd in my Head a long Time, the eager prevailing
Desire of Deliverance at length master'd all the rest; and I resolv'd,
if possible, to get one of those Savages into my Hands, cost what it
would. My next Thing then was to contrive how to do it, and this
indeed was very difficult to resolve on: But as I could pitch upon no
probable Means for it, so I resolv'd to put myself upon the Watch,
to see them when they came on Shore, and leave the rest to the
Event, taking such Measures as the Opportunity should present, let
be what would be.
With these Resolutions in my Thoughts, I set myself upon the
Scout, as often as possible, and indeed so often till I was heartily
tired of it; for it was above a Year and Half that I waited, and for
great part of that Time went out to the West End, and to the South
West Corner of the Island, almost every Day, to see for Canoes, but
none appear'd. This was very discouraging, and began to trouble
me much, though I cannot say that it did in this Case, as it had
done some time before that, (viz.) wear off the Edge of my Desire to
the Thing. But the longer it seemed to be delay'd, the more eager
I was for it; in a Word, I was not at first so careful to shun the
sight of these Savages, and avoid being seen by them, as I was now
eager to be upon them.
Besides, I fancied myself able to manage One, nay, Two or Three
Savages, if I had them so as to make them entirely Slaves to me,
to do whatever I should direct them, and to prevent their being able
at any time to do me any Hurt It was a great whil^ that I pleased
myself with this Affair, but nothing still presented; all my Fancies
and Schemes came to nothing, for no Savages came near me for a
great while.
About a Year and half after I had entertain'd these Notions, and
by long musing, had as it were resolved them all into nothing, for
want of an Occasion to put them in Execution, I was surpris'd one
Morning early, with seeing no less than five Canoes all on Shore to-
gether on my side the Island; and the People who belong'd to them
all landed, and out of my sight: The Number of them broke all my
Measures, for seeing so many, and knowing that they always came
four or six, or sometimes more in a Boat, I could not tell what to
think of it, or how to take my Measures, to attack Twenty or Thirty
Men single-handed; so I lay still in my Castle, perplex'd and dis-
comforted: However I put myself into all the same Postures for an
Attack that I had formerly provided, and was just ready for Action,
if anything had presented. Having waited a good while, listening to
hear if they made any Noise; at length, being very impatient, I set
my Guns at the Foot of my Ladder, and clamber'd up to the Top of
the Hill, by my two Stages as usual; standing so however that my
Head did not appear above the Hill, so that they could not perceive
me by any Means; here I observ'd, by the help of my Perspective
Glass, that they were no less than Thirty in Number, that they had a
Fire kindled, that they had had Meat dressed. How they had cooked
it, that I knew not, or what it was; but they were all Dancing in I
know not how many barbarous Gestures and Figures, their own Way,
round the Fire.
While I was thus looking on them, I perceived by my Perspective,
two miserable Wretches dragged from their Boats, where it seems
they were laid by, and were now brought out for the Slaughter. I
perceived one of them immediately fell, being knocked down, I
suppose with a Club or Wooden Sword, for that was their way, and
two or three others were at work immediately cutting him open for their
Cookarv, while the other Victim was left standing bv himself, rill thev
should be ready for him. In that very Moment this poor Wretch
seeing himself a little at Liberty, Nature inspir'd him with Hopes of
Life, and he started away from them, and ran with incredible Swiftness
along the Sands directly towards me, I mean towards that part of the
Coast, where my Habitation was.
I was dreadfully frighted, (that I must acknowledge) when I per-
ceived him to run my Way; and especially, when as I thought I saw
him pursued by the whole Body, and now I expected that part of
my Dream was coming to pass, and that he would certainly take
shelter in my Grove; but I could not depend by any means upon
my Dream for the rest of it, (viz.) that the other Savages would not
pursue him thither, and find him there. However I kept my Station,
and my Spirits began to recover, when I found that there was not
above three Men that follow'd him, and still more was I encourag'd,
when I found that he outstripp'd them exceedingly in running, and
gained Ground of them, so that if he could but hold it for half an
Hour, I saw easily he would fairly get away from them all.
There was between them and my Castle, the Creek which I men-
tion'd often at the first part of my Story, when I landed my Cargoes
out of the Ship; and this I saw plainly, he must necessarily swim
over, or the poor Wretch would be taken there : But when the Savage
escaping came thither, he made nothing of it, though the Tide was
then up, but plunging in, swam through in about Thirty Strokes or
thereabouts, landed and ran on with exceeding Strength and Swift-
ness; when the Three Persons came to the Creek, I found that Two
of them could Swim, but the Third could not, and that standing on
the other Side, he looked at the other, but went no further; and soon
after went softly back again, which as it happen'd, was very well for
him in the main.
I observ'd, that the two who swam, were yet more than twice as
long swimming over the Creek, as the Fellow was, that fled from
them: It came very warmly upon my Thoughts, and indeed irre-
sistibly, that now was my Time to get me a Servant, and perhaps a
Companion, or Assistant; and that I was called plainly by Provi-
dence to save this poor Creature's Life; I immediately run down the
Ladders with all possible Expedition, fetches my two Guns, for they
were both but at the Foot of the Ladders, as I observ'd above ; and get-
ting up again, with the same haste, to the Top of the Hill, I crossed
toward the Sea; and having a very short Cut, and all down Hill,
ADVENTURES OF
clapped myself in the way, between the Pursuers, and the Pursu'd,
hallowing aloud to him that fled, who looking back, was at first per-
haps as much frighted at me, as at them; but I beckon'd with my
Hand to him, to come back ; and in the meantime, I slowly advanc'd
towards the two that follow'd; then rushing at once upon the fore-
most, I knocked him down with the Stock of my Piece; I was loth
to fire, because I would not have the rest hear; though at that dis-
tance, it would not have been easily heard, and being out of Sight of
the Smoke too, they would not have easily known what to make of
it: Having knocked this Fellow down, the other who pursu'd with
him stopped, as if he had been frighted; and I advanc'd apace
towards him; but as I came nearer, I perceiv'd presently, he had a
Bow and Arrow, and was fitting it to shoot at me; so I was then
necessitated to shoot at him first, which I did, and killed him ai the

first Shot; the poor Savage who fled, but had stopped, though he saw
both his Enemies fallen, and killed as he thought; yet was so frighted
with the Fire, and Noise of my Piece, that he stood Stock still, and
neither came forward or went backward, though he seemed rather in-
clin'd to fly still, than to come on; I hallow'd again to him, and
made Signs to come forward, which he easily understood, and came
a little way, then stopped again, and then a little further, and stopped
again, and I could then perceive that he stood trembling, as if he
had been taken Prisoner, and had just been to be killed, as his two
Enemies were; I beckon'd him again to come to me, and gave him
all the Signs of Encouragement that I could think of, and he came
nearer and nearer, kneeling down every Ten or Twelve steps in token
of acknowledgment for my saving his Life: I smiled at him, and
looked pleasantly, and beckon'd him to come still nearer; at length
he came close to me, and then he kneeled down again, kissed the
Ground, and laid his Head upon the Ground, and taking me by the
Foot, set my Foot upon his Head; this it seems was in token of
iwearing to be my Slave for ever; I took him up, and made much
of him, and encourag'd him all I could. But there was more work
to do yet, for I perceived the Savage whom I knocked down, was
not killed, but stunned with the blow, and began to come to himself;
so I pointed to him, and showing him the Savage, that he was not
dead; upon this he spoke some Words to me, and though I could
not understand them, yet I thought they were pleasant to hear, for
they were the first sound of a Man's Voice that I had heard, my own
excepted, for above Twenty-five Years. But there was no time for
such Reflections now, the Savage who was knocked down recover'd
himself so far, as to sit up upon the Ground, and I perceived that my
Savage began to be afraid; but when I saw that, I presented my
other Piece at the Man, as if I would shoot him, upon this my
Savage;-/fcr so I called him now, made a Motion to me to lend him my
Sword, which hung naked in a Belt by my side; so I did; he no
sooner had it, but he runs to his Enemy, and at one blow cut off
his Head as cleverly, no Executioner in Germany, could have done
it sooner or better; which I thought very strange, for one who I had
Reason to believe never saw a Sword in his Life before, except their
own Wooden Swords; however it seems, as I learned afterwards, they
make their Wooden Swords so sharp, so heavy, and the Wood is so
hard, that they will cut off Heads even with them, aye and Arms,
and that at one blow too; when he had done this, he comes laugh-
ing to me in Sign of Triumph, and brought me the Sword again, and
with abundance of Gestures which I did not understand, laid it down
with the Head of the Savage, that he had killed just before me.
But that which astonish'd him most, was to know how I had
killed the other Indian so far off, so pointing to him, he made Signs
to me to let him go to him, so I bade him go, as well as I could,
when he came to him, he stood like one amaz'd, looking at him,
turned him first on one side, then on the other, looked at the Wound
the Bullet had made, which it seems was just in his Breast, where it
had made a Hole, and no great Quantity of Blood had follow'd, but he
had bled inwardly, for he was quite dead: He took up his Bow and
Arrows, and came back, so I turned to go away, and beckon'd to him
to follow me, making Signs to him, that more might come aftei
them.
Upon this he signed to me, that he should bury them with Sand,
that they might not be seen by the rest if they follow'd; and so I
made Signs again to him to do so; he fell to Work, and in an instant
he had scraped a Hole in the Sand, with his Hands, big enough to
bury the first in, and then dragged him into it, and cover'd him, and
did so also by the other; I believe he had buried them both in a
Quarter of an Hour; then calling him away, I carry'd him not to my
Castle, but quite away to my Cave, on the farther Part of the Island;
to I did not let my Dream come to pass in that Part, viz. That he
came into my Grove for Shelter.
Here I gave him Bread, and a Bunch of Raisins to eat, and a
Draught of Water, which I found he was indeed in great Distress
for, by his Running; and having refresh'd him, I made Signs for him
to go lie down and sleep; pointing to a Place where I had laid a
great Parcel of Rice Straw, and a Blanket upon it, which I used to
sleep upon myself sometimes; so the poor Creature laid down, and
went to sleep.
He was a comely handsome Fellow, perfectly well made ; with straight
strong Limbs, not too large; tall and well shaped, and as I reckon,
about twenty-six Years of Age. He had a very good Countenance,
not a fierce and surly Aspect; but seemed to have something very
manly in his Face, and yet he had all the Sweetness and Softness of
an European in his Countenance too, especially when he smiled.
His Hair was long and black, not curled like Wool; his Forehead
very high, and large, and a great Vivacity and sparkling Sharpness
in his Eyes. The Colour of his Skin was not quite black, but very
tawny; and yet not of an ugly yellow nauseous tawny, as the Brasilians,
and Virginians, and other Natives of America are; but of a bright
kind of a dun olive Colour, that had in it something very agreeable;
though not very easy to describe. His Face was round, and plump;
his Nose small, not flat like the. Negroes, a very good Mouth, thin
Lips, and his fine Teeth well set, 'and white as Ivory. After he had
slumber'd, rather than slept, about half an Hour, he waked again, and
comes out of the Cave to me; for I had been milking my Goats,
which I had in the Enclosure just by: When he espy'd me, he came
running to me, laying himself down again upon the Ground, with all
the possible Signs of a humble thankful Disposition, making a many
«»J
intic Gestures to show it: At last he lays his Head flat upon the
Ground, close to my Foot, and sets my other Foot upon his Head, as he
had done before; and after this, made all the Signs to me of Sub-
jection, Servitude, and Submission imaginable, to let me know, how he
would serve me as long as he lived; I understood him in many
Things, and let him know, I was very well pleased with him; in a
little Time I began to speak to him, and teach him to speak to me;
and first, I made him know his Name should be Friday, which was
the Day I saved his Life; I called him so for the Memory of th<
Time; I likewise taught him to say Master, and then let him know.

that was to be my Name; I likewise taught him to say Yes and No,
and to know the Meaning of them; I gave him some Milk, in ar
earthen Pot, and let him see me Drink it before him, and sop m\
Bread in it; and I gave him a Cake of Bread, to do the like, which
he quickly complied with, and mad# Signs that it was very good foi
him
I kept there with him all that Night; but as soon as it was Day, I
beckon'd to him to come with me, and let him know, I would give
him some Clothes, at which he seemed very glad, for he was stark
naked: As we went by the Place where he had buried the two Menj
he pointed exactly to the Place, and showed me the Marks that he
had made to find them again, making Signs to me that we should dig
them up again, and eat them; at this I appear'd very angry, express'd
my Abhorrence of it, made as if I would vomit at the Thoughts of it,
and beckon'd with my Hand to him to come away, which he did
immediately, with great Submission. I then led him up to the Top
of the Hill, to see if his Enemies were gone; and pulling out my
Glass, I looked, and saw plainly the Place where they had been, but
no appearance of them, or of their Canoes; so that it was plain
they were gone, and had left their two Comrades behind them, with-
out any search after them.
But I was not content with this Discovery; but having now more
Courage, and consequently more Curiosity, I took my Man Friday
with me, giving him the Sword in his Hand, with the Bow and Arrows
at his Back, which I found he could use very dexterously, making him
carry one Gun for me, and I two for myself, and away we marched
to the Place, where these Creatures had been; for I had a Mind now
to get some fuller Intelligence of them: When I came to the Place,
my very Blood ran chill in my Veins, and my Heart sunk within me,
at the Horror of the Spectacle: Indeed it was a dreadful Sight, at
least it was so to me; though Friday made nothing of it: The Place
was cover'd with human. Bones, the Ground dyed with their Blood,
great Pieces of Flesh left here and there, half eaten, mangled, and
scorch'd; and in short, all the Tokens of the triumphant Feast they
had been making there, after a Victory over their Enemies: I saw
three Skulls, five Hands, ar.d the Bones of three or four Legs and
Feet, and abundance of other Parts of the Bodies; and Friday, by
his Signs, made me understand, that they brought over four Prisoners
to feast upon; that three of them were eaten up, and that he, pointing
to himself, was the fourth: That there had been a great Battle be-
tween them, and their next King, whose Subjects it seems he had
been one of; and that they had taken a great Number of Prisoners,
all which were carry'd to several Places by those that had taken
them in the Fight, in order to feast upon them, as was done here by
these Wretches upon those they brought hither.
I caused Friday to'gather all the Skulls, Bones, Flesh, and whatever
remain'd, and lay them together on a Heap, and make a great Fire
upon it, and burn them all to Ashes: I found Friday had still a
hankering Stomach after some of the Flesh, and was still a Cannibal in
his Nature; but I discover'd so much Abhorrence at the very
Thoughts of it, and at the least Appearance of it, that he durst not
discover it; for I had by some Means let him know, that I would kill
him if he ofter'd it
When we had done this, we came back to our Castle, and there I fell
to work for my Man Friday; and first of all, I gave him a pair of
Linen Drawers, which I had out of the poor Gunner's Chest I men-
tion'd, and which I found in the Wreck; and which with a little
Alteration fitted him very well; then I made him a Jerkin of Goat's-
skin, as well as my Skill would allow; and I was now grown a tolerable
good Tailor; and I gave him a Cap, which I had made of a Hare-skin,
very convenient and fashionable enough; and thus he was clothed for
the present, tolerably well; and was mighty well pleased to see him-
self almost as well clothed as his Master: It is true, he went
awkwardly in these Things at first; wearing the Drawers was very
awkward to him, and the Sleeves of the Waistcoat galled his Shoulders,
and the inside of his Arms; but a little easing them where he com-
plain'd they hurt him, and using himself to them, at length he took to
them very well.
The next Day after I came home to my Hutch with him, I began
to consider where I should lodge him; and that I might do well for
him, and yet be perfectly easy myself, I made a little Tent for him in
the vacant Place between my two Fortifications, in the inside of the
last, and in the outside of the first: and as there was a Door, or
Entrance there into my Cave, I made a formal framed Door-case, and
a Door to it of Boards, and set it up in the Passage, a little within
the Entrance; and causing the Door to open on the inside, I barred
it up in the Night, taking in my Ladders too; so that Friday could
no way come at me in the inside of my innermost Wall, without
making so much Noise in getting over, that it must needs waken me;
for my first Wall had now a complete Roof over it of long Poles,
covering all my Tent, and leaning up to the side of the Hill, which
was again laid cross with smaller Sticks instead of Laths, and then
thatched over a great Thickness, with the Puce Straw, which was
strong like Reeds; and at the Hole or Place which was left to go in
or out by the Ladder, I had placed a kind of Trap-door, which if it had
been attempted on the outside, would not have opened at all, but
would have fallen down, and made a great Noise; and as to Wea-
pons, 1 took them all in to my Side every Night.
But I needed none of all this Precaution; for never Man had a
more faithful, loving, sincere Servant, than Friday was to me ; without
Passions, Sullenness or Designs, perfectly oblig'd and engag'd; his
very Affections were tied to me, like those of a Child to a Father;
and I dare say, he would have sacrific'd his Life for the saving mine,
upon any occasion whatsoever; the many Testimonies he gave me
of this, put it out of doubt, and soon convinc'd me, that I needed to
use no Precautions, as to my Safety on his Account
This frequently gave me occasion to observe, and that with
wonder, that however it had pleased God, in his Providence, and in
the Government of the V'orks of his Hands, to take from so great a
Part of the W.orId of his Creatures, the best uses to which their
Faculties, and the Powers of their Souls are adapted ; yet that he has
bestow'd upon them the same Powers, the same Reason, the same
Affections, the same Sentiments of Kindness and Obligation, the
same Passions and Resentments of Wrongs; the same Sense of Grati-
tude, Sincerity, Fidelity, and all the Capacities of doing Good, and
receiving Good, that he has given to us; and that when he pleases to
offer to them Occasions of exerting these, they are as ready, nay,
more ready to apply them to the right Uses for which they were
bestow'd, than we are; and this made me very melancholy some-
times, in reflecting, as the several Occasions presented, how mean a
Use we make of all these, even though we have these Powers
enlighten'd by the great Lamp of Instruction, the Spirit of God, and
by the Knowledge of his Word, added to our Understanding; and
why it has pleased God to hide the like saving Knowledge from so
many Millions of Souls, who if I might judge by this poor Savage,
would make a much better use of it than we did.
From hence, I sometimes was led too far to invade the Sovereignty
of Providence, and as it were arraign the Justice of so arbitrary a
Disposition of Things, that should hide that Light from some, and
reveal it to others, and yet expect a like Duty from both: But I shut
it up, and checked my Thoughts with this Conclusion, (1st) That we
did not know by what Light and Law these should be Condemn'd;
but that as God was necessarily, and by the Nature of his Being,
infinitely Holy and Just, so it could not be; but that if these Creatures
were all sentenc'd to Absence from himself, it was on account of
iinning against that Light which, as the Scripture says, was a Law to
themselves, and by such Rules as their Consciences would acknowledge
to be just, though the Foundation was not discover'd to us: And,
(2nd.) that still as we are all the Clay in the Hand of the Potter, no
Vessel could say to him, Why hast thou formed me thus?
But to return to my New Companion; I was greatly delighted with
him, and made it my Business to teach him everything, that was proper
to make him useful, handy, and helpful; but especially to make him
speak, and understand me when I spake, and he was the aptest
Scholar that ever was, and particularly was so merry, so constantly
diligent, and so pleased, when he could but understand me, or make
me understand him, that it was very pleasant to me to tall \ to him;
and now my Life began to be so easy, that I began to say 11 myself,
that could I but have been safe from more Savages, I cared not, if I
was never to remove from the place while I lived.
After I had been two or three Days return'd to my Castle, I thought
that, in order to bring Friday off from his horrid way of feeding, and
from the Relish of a Cannibal's Stomach, I ought to let him taste other
Flesh; so I took him out with me one Morning to the Woods: I
went indeed intending to kill a Kid out of my own Flock, and bring
him home and dress it But as I was going, I saw a She Goat lying
down in the Shade, and two young Kids sitting by her, I catched
hold of Friday, hold, says I, stand still; and made Signs to him not
to stir, immediately I presented my Piece, shot and killed one of the
Kids. The poor Creature, who had at a Distance indeed seen me
kill the Savage his" Enemy, but did not know, or could imagine how
it was done, was sensibly surpris'd, trembled, and shook, and looked
so amaz'd, that I thought he would have sunk down. He did not
see the Kid I had shot at, or perceive I had killed it, but ripped up
his Waistcoat to feel if he was not wounded, and as I found, presently
thought I was resob/d to kill him; for he came and kneeled down to
me, and embracing my Knees, said a great many Things I did not
understand; but I could easily see that the meaning was to pray me
not to kill him.
I soon found a way to convince him that I would do him no harm,
and taking him up by the Hand laughed at him, and pointed to the
Kid which I had killed, beckoned to him to run and fetch it, which
he did; and while he was wondering and looking to see how the
Creature was killed, I loaded my Gun again, and by-and-by I saw a
great Fowl like a Hawk sit upon a Tree within Shot; so to let Friday
understand a little what I would do, I called him to me again, pointed
at the Fowl which was indeed a Parrot, though I thought it had been
a Hawk, I say pointing to the Parrot, and to my Gun, and to the
Ground under the Parrot, to let him see I would make it fall, I made
him understand that I would shoot and kill that Bird; accordingly I
fired and bade him look, and immediately he saw the Parrot fall,
he stood like one frighted again, notwithstanding all I had said to
him; and I found he was the more amaz'd, because he did not see
me put anything into the Gun; but thought that there must be some
wonderful Fund of Death and Destruction in that Thing, able to kill
Man, Beast, Bird, or anything, near or far off; and the Astonishment
this created in him was such, as could not wear off for a long Time;
and I believe, if I would have let him, he would have worshipp'd me
and my Gun: As for the Gun itself, he would not so much as touch
it for several Days after; but would speak to it, and talk to it, as if it
had-ans_wer'd him, when he was by himself; which, as I afterwards
learned of him, was to desire it not to kill him.
Well, after his Astonishment was a little over at this, I pointed to
him to run and fetch the Bird I had shot, which he did, but stayed some
Time; for the Parrot not being quite dead, was flutter'd away a good
way Off from the Place where she fell; however, he found her, took
her up, and brought her to me; and as I had perceiv'd his Ignorance
about the Gun before, I took this Advantage to charge the Gun again,
and not let him see me do it, that I might be ready for any other
Mark that might present; but nothing more offer'd at that Time;
so I brought home the Kid, and the same Evening I took the Skin
off, and cut it out as well as I could; and having a Pot for that
purpose, I boiled or stewed some of the Flesh, and made some very
good Broth; and after I had begun to eat some, I gave some to my
Man, who seemed very glad of it, and liked it very well; but that
which was strangest to him, was, to see me eat Salt with it; he made
a Sign to me, that the Salt was not good to eat, and putting a little
into his own Mouth, he seemed to nauseate it, and would spit and
sputter at it, washing his Mouth with fresh Water after it; on the
other hand, I took some Meat in my Mouth without Salt, and I pre-
tended to spit and sputter for want of Salt, as fast as he had done at
tiie Salt; but it would not do, he would never care for Salt with his
Meat, or in his Broth; at least not a great while, and then but a very
little.
Having thus fed him with boiled Meat and Broth, I was resob/d
189
to feast him the next Day with roasting a Piece of the Kid; this I did
by hanging It before the Fire, in a String, as I had seen many People
do in England, setting two Poles up, one on each side the Fire,
and one cross on the Top, and tying the String to the Cross-stick,
letting the Meat tiUTi continually: This Friday admir'd very much;
but when he came to taste the Flesh, he took so many ways to tell
me how well he liked
it, that I could not but
understand him; and
at last he told me he
would never eat Man's
Flesh any more, which
I was very glad to hear.
The next Day I set
him to work to beating
some Cor n out, and
sifting it in the manner
I used to do, as I ob-
serv'd before, and he
soon understood how
to do it as well as I,
especially after he had
seen what the Meaning
of it was, and that it
was to make Bread of;
for after that I let him
see me make my Bread,
and bake it too, and in
a little Time Friday
was able to do all the
Work for me, as well
<ts 1 could do it myself.
I began now to consider, that having two Mouths to feed, instead
of one, I must provide more Ground for my Harvest, and plant a
larger Quantity of Corn, than I used to do; so I marked out a larger
Piece of Land, and began the Fence in the same Manner as before,
in which Friday not only worked very willingly and very hard; but
did it very cheerfully, and I told him what it was for; that it was for
Com to make more Bread, because he was now with me, and that I

ADVENTURES OF
might have enough for him, and myself too: He appear'd very sensible
of that Part, and let me know, that he thought I had much more
Labour upon me on his Account, than I had for myself; and that he
would work the harder for me, if I would tell him what to do.
This was the pleasantest Year of all the Life I led in this Place;
Friday began to talk pretty well, and understand the Names of almost
everything I had occasion to call for, and of every Place I had to
send him to, and talked a great deal to me; so that in short I began
now to have some Use for my Tongue again, which indeed I had
very little occasion for before; that is to say, about Speech; besides
the Pleasure of talking to him, I had a singular Satisfaction in the
Fellow himself; his simple unfeign'd Honesty appear'd to me more
and more every Day, and I began really to love the Creature; and
on his Side, I believe he loved me more than it was possible for him
ever to love anything before.
I had a Mind once
to try if he had any
hankering Inclina-
tion to his own
Country again, and
having learned him
English so well that
he could answer me
almost any Ques-
tions, I asked him
whether the Nation
that he belong'd to
never conquer'd in
Battle, at which he
smiled; and said,
yes, yes, we always
fight the better; that
is, he meant always get the better in Fight; and so we began the
following Discourse: You always fight the better, said I, How came
you to be taken Prisoner then, Friday?
Friday, My Nation beat much, for all that
Master, How beat; if your Nation beat them, how come you to be
taken?
Friday, They more many than my Nation in the Place where mo

tuauSEEBSHHu
iras; they take one, two, three, and me; my Nation over beat them
in the yonder Place, where me no was; there my Nation take one,
two, great Thousand.
Master, But why did not your Side recover you from the Hands of
your Enemies then?
Friday, They run one, two, three, and me, and make go in the
Canoe; my Nation have no Canoe that time.
Master, Well, Friday, and What does your Nation do with the Men
they take, do they carry them away, and eat them, as these did?
Friday, Yes, my Nation eat Mans too, eat all up.
Master, Where do they carry them?
Friday, Go to other Place where they think.
Master, Do they come hither?
Friday, Yes, yes, they come hither; come ether else Place.
Master, Have you been here with thern?
Friday, Yes, I been here; [points to the N.W. Side of the Island]
which it seems was their Side.
P>y this I understood, that my Man Friday had formerly been
among the Savages, who used to come on Shore on the farther Part
of ihe Island, on the same Man-eating Occasions that he was now
brought for; and some time after, when I took the Courage to carry
him to that Side, being the same I formerly mention'd, he presently
knew the Place, and told me, he was there once when they eat up
twenty Men, two Women, and one Child; he could not tell Twenty
in English; but he numbered them by laying so many Stones on a
Row, and pointing to me to tell them over.
I have told this Passage, because it introduces what follows; that
after I had had this Discourse with him, I asked him how far it was
from our Island to the Shore, and whether the Canoes were not often
lost; he told me there was no Danger, no Canoes ever lost; but that
after a little way out to the Sea, there was a Current, and Wind,
always one way in the Morning, the other in the Afternoon.
This I understood to be no more than the Sets of the Tide, as going
out, or coming in; but I afterwards understood, it was occasion'd by
the great Draft and Reflux of the mighty River Oroonooko; in the
Mouth, or the Gulf of which River, as I found afterwards, our Island
lay; and this Land which I perceiv'd to the W. and N. W. was the
great Island Trinidad, on the North Point of the Mouth of the River;
I asked Friday a thousand Questions about the Country, the Inhabi-
touts, the Sea, the Coast, and what Nation were near; he told me al
he knew with the greatest Openness imaginable; I asked him the
Names of the several Nations of his Sort of People, but could get no
other Name than Caribs; from whence I easily understood, that these
were the Caribbees, which our Maps place on the Part of America
which reaches from the Mouth of the River Oroonooko to Guiana, and
onwards to St. Martha: Ke told me that up a great way beyond the
Moon, that was, beyond the Setting of the Moon, which must be W.
from their Country, there dwelt white-bearded Men, like me, and
pointed to my great Whiskers, which I mention'd before; and that
they had killed much Mans, that was his Word; by all which I under-
stood, he meant the Spaniards, whose Cruelties in America had been
spread over the whole Countries, and was remember'd by all the
Nations from Father to Son.
I inquir'd if he could tell me how I might come from this Island,
and get among those white Men; he told me, yes, yes, I might go in
two Canoe; I could not understand what he meant, or make him de-
scribe to me what he meant by two Canoe, till at last with great Diffi-
culty, I found he meant it must be in a large great Boat, as big as two
Canoes.
This Part of Friday's Discourse began to relish with me very well,
and from this Time I entertain'd some Hopes, that one Time or
other, I might find an Opportunity to make my Escape from this
Place; and that this poor Savage might be a Means to help me to
do it
During the long Time that Friday has now been with me, and that
he began to speak to me, and understand me, I was not wanting to
lay a Foundation of religious Knowledge in his Mind; particularly J
asked him one Time who made him? The poor Creature did not
understand me at all, but thought I had asked who was his Father;
but I took it by another handle, and asked him who made the Sea,
the Ground we walked on, and the Hills, and Woods; he told me it
was one old Benamuckee, that lived beyond all: He could describe
nothing of this great Person, but that he was very old; much older
he said than the Sea, or the Land; than the Moon, or the Stars: 1
asked him then, if this old Person had made all Things, why did not
all Things worship him; he look'd very grave, and with a perfect
Look of Innocence, said, All Things do say O to him: I asked him
if the People who die in his Country went away anywhere; he siid
fRnc("tn AND PRIPAY ON AN NXPFniTION.—P. lt}K
yes, they all went to Benamuckee; then I asked him whether these
they eat up went thither too, he said yes.
From these Things, I began to instruct him in the Knowledge of
the true God: I told him that the great Maker of all Things lived
up there, pointing up towards Heaven: That he governs the World
by the same Power and Providence by which he had made it: That
he was omnipotent, could do everything for us, give everything to us,
take everything from us; and thus by Degrees I open'd his Eyes.
He listened with great Attention, and receiv'd with Pleasure the Notion
of Jesus Christ being sent to redeem us, and of the Manner of making
our Prayers to God, and his being able to hear us, even into Heaven;
he told me one Day, that if our God could hear us up beyond the
Sun, he must needs be a greater God than their Benamuckee, who
lived but a little way off, and yet could not hear, till they went up to
the great Mountains where he dwelt, to speak to him; I asked him
if ever he went thither, to speak to him; he said no, they never
went that were young Men; none went thither but the old Men, who
he called their Oowocakee, that is, as I made him explain it to me,
their Religious, or Clergy, and that they went to say O, (so he called
saying Prayers) and then came back, and told them what Benamuckee
said: By this I observ'd, That there is Priestcraft, even amongst the
most blinded ignorant Pagans in the World; and the Policy of making
a secret Religion, in order to preserve the Veneration of the People
to the Clergy, is not only to be found in the Roman, but perhaps
among all Religions in the World, even among the most brutish and
barbarous Savages.
I endeavour'd to clear up this Fraud, to my Man Friday, and told
him, that the Pretence of their old Men going up the Mountains,
to say O to their God Benamuckee, was a Cheat, and their bringing
Word from thence what he said, was much more so; that if they met
with any Answer, or spake with any one there, it must be with an evil
Spirit: And then I enter'd into a long Discourse with him about the
Devil, the Original of him, his Rebellion against God, his Enmity to
Man, the Reason of it, his setting himself up in the dark Parts of the
World to be Worshipp'd instead of God, and as God; and the many
Stratagems he made use of to delude Mankind to his Ruin; how
he had a secret access to our Passions, and to our Affections, to
adapt his Snares so to our Inclinations, as to cause us even to be our
own Tempters, and to run upon our Destruction by our own Choice.
1
I found it was not so easy to imprint right Notions in his Mind
about the Devil, as it was about the Being of a God. Nature assisted
all my Arguments to Evidence to him, even the Necessity of a great first
Cause and over-ruling governing Power; a secret directing Providence,
and of the Equity, and Justice, of paying Homage to him that made us,
and the like. But there appeared nothing of all this in the Notion of an
evil Spirit; of his Original, his Being, his Nature, and above all of his
Inclination to do Evil, and to draw us in to do so too; and the poor
Creature puzzled me once in such a Manner, by a Question merely
natural and innocent, that I scarce knew what to say to him. I had
been talking a great deal to him of the Power of God, his Omnipo-
tence, his dreadful Antipathy to Sin, his being a consuming Fire to the
Workers of Iniquity; how, as he had made us all, he could destroy
us and all the World in a Moment; and he listen'd with great Serious-
ness to me all the while.
After this, I had been tellling him how the Devil was God's Enemy
in the Hearts of Men, and used all his Malice and Skill to defeat the
good Designs of Providence, and to ruin the Kingdom of Christ in
the World; and the like, Well, says Friday, but you say, God is so
strong, so great, is he not much string, much might as the Devil?
Yes, yes, says I, Friday, God is stronger than the Devil, God is
above the Devil, and therefore we pray to God to tread him down
under our Feet, and enable us to resist his Temptations and quench
his fiery Darts. But, says he again, if God much strong, much might
as the Devil, why God no kill the Devil, so make him no more do
-wicked?
I was strangely surpris'd at his Question, and after all, though I
was now an old Man, yet I was but a young Doctor, and ill enough
qualified for a Casuist, or a Solver of Difficulties: And at first I
could not tell what to say, so I pretended not to hear him, and asked
him what he said? But he was too earnest for an Answer to forget
his Question; so that he repeated it in the very same broken Words,
as above. By this time I had recovered myself a little, and I said,
God will at last punish him severely; he is reserv'd for the Judgment,
and is to be cast into the Bottomless Pit, to dwell with everlasting Fire.
This did not satisfy Friday, but he returns upon me, repeating my
Words, Reserve, at last, me no understand; but, Why not kill the
Devil now, not kill great ago? You may as well ask me, said I, Why
God does not kill vou and I, when we do wicked Things here that
offend him? We are preseiVd to repent and be pardon'd: He muses
a while at this; well, well, says he, mighty affectionately, that well;
so you, I, Devil, all wicked, all preserve, repent, God pardon all. Here
I was run down again by him to the last Degree, and it was a Testi-
mony to me, how the mere Notions of Nature, though they will guide
reasonable Creatures to the Knowledge of a God, and of a Worship or
Homage due to the supreme Being, of God as the Consequence
of our Nature; yet nothing but divine Revelation can form the
Knowledge of Jesus Christ, and of a Redemption purchas'd for us, of
a Mediator of the new Covenant, and of an Intercessor, at the Foot-
stool of God's Throne; I say, nothing but a Revelation from Heaven,
can form these in the Soul; and that therefore the Gospel of our
Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ; I mean, the Word of God, and the
Spirit of God promised for the Guide and Sanctifier of his People,
are the absolutely necessary Instructors of the Souls of Men, in the
saving Knowledge of God, and the Means of Salvation.
I therefore diverted the present Discourse between me and my
Man, rising up hastily, as upon some sudden Occasion of going out;
then sending him for something a good way off, I seriously prayed to
God that he would enable me to instruct savingly this poor Savage,
assisting by his Spirit the Heart of the poor ignorant Creature, to
receive the Light of the Knowledge of God in Christ, reconciling him
to himself, and would guide me to speak so to him from the Word of
God, as his Conscience might be convinc'd, his Eyes opened, and his
Soul saved. When he came again to me, I enter'd into a long Dis-
course with him upon the Subject of the Redemption of Man by the
Saviour of the World, and of the Doctrine of the Gospel preach'd
from Heaven, viz. of Repentance towards God, and Faith in our
Blessed Lord Jesus. I then explain'd to him, as well as I could, why
our Blessed Redeemer took not on him the Nature of Angels, but the
Seed of Abraham, and how for that Reason the fallen Angels had no
Share in the Redemption; that he came only to the lost Sheep of
the House of Israel, and the like.
I had, God knows, more Sincerity than Knowledge, in all the
Methods I took for this poor Creature's Instruction, and must
acknowledge what I believe all that act upon the same Principle will
find, That in laying Things open to him, I really inform'd and
instructed myself in many Things, that either I did not know, or had
not fully consider'd before, but which occurr'd naturally to my Mind,
upon my searching into them, for the Information of this poor
Savage; and I had more Affection in my Inquiry after Things upon
this Occasion, than ever I felt before; so that whether this poor
wild Wretch was the better for me, or no, I had great Reason to be
thankful that ever he came to me: My Grief set lighter upon me, my
Habitation grew comfortable to me beyond Measure; and when I re-
flected that in this solitary Life which I had been confin'd to, I had
not only been moved myself to look up to Heaven, and to seek to
the Hand that had brought me there; but was now to be made an Instru-
ment under Providence to save the Life, and, for ought I knew, the
Soul of a poor Savage, and bring him to the true Knowledge of
Religion, and of the Christian Doctrine, that he might know Christ
Jesus, to know whom is Life eternal; I say, When I reflected upon all
these Things, a secret Joy run through every Part of my Soul, and I
frequently rejoic'd that ever I was brought to this Place, which I had
so often thought the most dreadful of all Afflictions that could possibly
have befallen me.
In this thankful Frame I continu'd all the Remainder of my Time,
and the Conversation which employ'd the Hours between Friday and
I, was such, as made the three Years which we lived there together
perfectly and completely happy, //" any such Thing as complete Happi-
ness can be formed in a sublunary State. The Savage was now a good
Christian, a much better than I; though I have reason to hope, and
bless God for it, that we were equally penitent, and comforted restor'd
Penitents; we had here the Word of God to read, and no farther off
from his Spirit to instruct, than if we had been in England.
I always apph/d myself in Reading the Scripture, to let him know,
as well as I could, the Meaning of what I read; and he again, by his
serious Inquiries and Questions, made me, / said before, a much
better Scholar in the Scripture Knowledge, than I should ever have
been by my own private mere Reading. Another thing I cannot
refrain from observing here also from Experience, in this retir'd Part
of my Life, viz. How infinite and inexpressible a Blessing it is, that
the Knowledge of God, and of the Doctrine of Salvation by Christ
fesus, is so plainly laid down in the Word of God; so easy to be
receiv'd and understood: That as the bare reading the Scripture made
me capable of understanding enough of my Duty, to carry me directly
on to the great Work of sincere Repentance for my Sins, and laying
hold of a Saviour for Life and Salvation, to a stated Reformation in
Practice, and Obedience to all God's commands, and this without any
Teacher or Instructor; I mean, human; so the same plain Instruction
lufficiently served to the enlightening this Savage Creature, and bring-
ing him to be such a Christian, as I have known few equal to him in
my Life.
As to all the Disputes, Wranglings, Strife, and Contention, which
has happen'd in the World about Religion, whether Niceties in
Doctrines, or Schemes of Church Government, they were all perfectly
useless to us; as for ought I can yet see, they have been to all the
rest of the World: We had the sure Guide to Heaven, viz. The Word
of God; and we had, blessed be God, comfortable Views of the Spirit
of God teaching and instructing us by his Word, leading us into all
Truth, and making us both willing and obedient to the Instruction of
his Word; and I cannot see the least Use that the greatest Knowledge
of the disputed Points in Religion which have made such Confusions
in the World would have been to us, if we could have obtain'd it #
but I must go on with the Historical Part of Things, and take every
Part in its Order.
After Friday and I became more intimately acquainted, and that
he could understand almost all I said to him, and speak fluently,
though in broken English, to me; I acquainted him with my own
Story, or at least so much of it as related to my coming into the
Place, how I had lived there, and how long. I let him into the
Mystery, for such it was to him, of Gunpowder and Bullet, and taught
him how to shoot: I gave him a Knife, which he was wonderfully
delighted with, and I made him a Belt, with a Frog hanging to it,
such as in England we wear Hangers in; and in the Frog, instead of
a Hanger, I gave him a Hatchet, which was not only as good a
Weapon in some Cases, but much more useful upon other Occasions.
I describ'd to him the Country of Europe, and particularly England,
which I came from; how we lived, how we worshipp'd God, how we
behav'd to one another; and how we traded in Ships to all Parts of
the World: I gave him an Account of the Wreck which I had been
on board of, and showed him as near as I could, the Place where she
lay; but she was all beaten in Pieces before, and gone.
I showed him the Ruins of our Boat, which we lost when we escap'd,
and which I could not stir with my whole Strength then, but was now
fallen almost all to Pieces: Upon seeing this Boat, Friday stood
musing a great while, and said nothing; I asked him what it was he
Itudied upon; at last says he, me see such Boat like come to Place at
my Nation.
I did not understand him a good while; but at last, when I had
examin'd farther into it, I understood by him, that a Boat, such as
that had been, came on Shore upon the Country where he lived; that
is, as he explain'd it, was driven thither by Stress of Weather: I pre-
sently imagin'd, that some European Ship must have been cast away
upon their Coast, and the Boat might get loose, and drive ashore;
but was so dull, that I never once thought of Men making escape
from a Wreck thither, much less whence they might come; so I only
inquir'd after a Description of the Boat
Friday describ'd the Boat to me well enough; but brought me
better to understand him, when he added with some Warmth, we save
the white Mans from drown: Then I presently asked him, if there
was any white Mans, as he called them, in the Boat; yes, he said,
the Boat full white Mans: I asked him how many; he told upon
his Fingers seventeen: I asked him then what become of them; he
told me, they live, they dwell at my Nation.
This put new Thoughts into my Head; for I presently imagin'd,
that these might be the Men belonging to the Ship, that was cast away
in Sight of my Island, as I now call it; and who after the Ship was
struck on the Rock, and they saw her inevitably lost, had saved
themselves in their Boat, and were landed upon that wild Shore
among the Savages.
Upon this, I inquir'd of him more critically, What was become of
them? He assur'd me they lived still there; that they had been there
about four Years; that the Savages let them alone, and gave them
Victuals to live. I asked him, How it came to pass they did not kill
them and eat them? He said, No, they make Brother with them; that
is, as I understood him, a Truce: And then he added, They no eat
Mans but when make the War fight; that is to say, they never eat
any Men, but such as come to fight with them, and are taken in
Battle.
It was after this some considerable Time, that being upon the Top of
the Hill, at the East Side of the Island, from whence as I have said,
I had in a clear Day discover'd the Main, or Continent of America;
Friday, the Weather being very serene, looks very earnestly towards
the main Land, and in a kind of Surprise, falls a jumping and dancing,
and calls out to me for I was at some Distance from him: I asked
him, What was the Matter? 0 Joy 1 says he, O glad I There see mj
Country, there my Nation I
I observ'd an extraordinary Sense of Pleasure appear'd in his Face,
and his Eyes sparkled, and his Countenance discover'd a strange
Eagerness, as if he had a Mind to be in his own Country again; and
this Observation of mine, put a great many Thoughts into me, which
made me at first not so easy about my new Man Friday as I was be-
fore; and I made no Doubt, but that if Friday could get back to his
own Nation again, he would not only forget all his Religion, but all his
Obligation to me; and would be forward enough to give his Country-
men an Account of me, and come back perhaps with a hundred or
two of them, and make a Feast upon me, at which he might be as
merry as he used to be with those of his Enemies, when they were
taken in War.
But I wronged the poor honest Creature very much, for which ]
was very sorry afterwards. However as my Jealousy increased, and
held me some Weeks, I was a little more circumspect, and not so
familiar and kind to him as before; in which I was certainly in the
Wrong too, the honest grateful Creatuie having no thought about it,
but what consisted with the best Principles, both as a religious
Christian, and as a grateful Friend, as appeared afterwards to my full
Satisfaction.
While my Jealousy of him lasted, you may be sure I was every
Day pumping him to see if he would discover any of the new
Thoughts, which I suspected were in him; but I found everything
he said was so Honest, and so innocent, that I could find nothing to
nourish my Suspicion; and in spite of all my Uneasiness he made
me at last entirely his own again, nor did he in the least perceive that
I was uneasy, and therefore I could not suspect him of Deceit
One Day walking up the same Hill, but the Weather being hazy at
Sta, so that we could not see the Continent, I called to him, and
said, Friday, do not you wish yourself in your own Country, your
own Nation? Yes, he said, he be much 0 glad to be at his own Nation.
What would you do there, said I, would you turn wild again, eat
Men's Flesh again, and be a Savage as you were before. He looked
full of Concern, and shaking his Head said, No, no, Friday tell them
to live good, tell them to pray God, tell them to eat Corn-bread, Cattle-flesh,
Milk, no eat Man again: Why then, said I to him, They will kill you.
He looked grave at that, and then said, No, they no kill me, the?
wilting love learn: He meant by this, they would would be willing to
learn. He added, they learnt much of the Bearded-Mans that come
in the Boat Then I asked him if he would go back to them? He
smiled at that, and told me he could not swim so far. I told him I
would make a Canoe for him. He told me, he would go if I would
go with him. I go! says I, why, they will eat me if I come there?
No, no, says he, me make they no Eat you; me make they much Love you.
He meant, he would tell them how I had killed his Enemies, and
saved his Life, and so he would make them love me; then he told
me as well as he could, how kind they were to seventeen White
men, or Bearded-men, as he called them, who came on Shore
there in Distress.
From this time I confess I had a Mind to venture over, and see
if I could possibly join with these Bearded-men, who I made no
Doubt were Spaniards or Portuguese; not doubting but if I could
we might find some Method to Escape from thence, being upon the
Continent, and a good Company together; better Uian I could from
an Island 40 Miles off the Shore, and alone with mt Help. <>o after
some Days I took Friday to work again, by waj of Discourse, and
told him I would give him a Boat to go back to his own Nation; and
accordingly I carried him to my Frigate which lay on the other Side
of the Island, and having cleared it of Water, for I always kept it
sunk in the Water; I brought it out, showed it him, and we both went
into it
I found he was a most dexterous Fellow at managing it, would make
it go almost as swift and fast again as I could; so when he was in, I
said to him, Well, now, Friday, shall we go to your Nation? He
looked very dull at my saying so, which it seems was, because he
thought the Boat too small to go so far. I told him then I had a
bigger; so the next Day I went to the Place where the first Boat lay
which I had made, but which I could not get into Water: He said
that was big enough; but then as I had taken no Care of it, and it
had lain two or three-and-twenty Years there, the Sun had split and
dried it, that it was in a manner rotten. Friday told me such a Boat
would do very well, and would carry much enough Vittle, Drink, Breaa\
that was his Way of Talking.
Upon the whole, I was by this Time so fixed upon my Design oi
going over with him to the Continent, that I told him we would go
and make one as big as that, and he should go home in it He
tnswer'd not one Word, but looked very grave and sad: I asked him
what was the matter with him? He asked me again thus; Why, you
angry mad with Friday, what me done? I asked him what he meant;
I told him I was not angry with him at all. No angry I No angry I
says he, repeating the Words several Times, Why send Friday home
away to my Nation? Why (says I) Friday, did you not say you wished
you were there? Yes, yes, says he, wish we be both there, no wish
Friday there, no Master there. In a Word, he would not think of going
there without me; I go there I Friday, (says I) what shall I do there?
He turned very quick upon me at this: You do great deal much good,
says he, you teach wild Mans be good sober tame Mans; you tell them
know God, fray God, and live new Life. Alas I Friday, (says I) thou
knowest not what thou sayest, I am but an ignorant Man myself.
Yes, yes, says he,you teachee me Good, you teachee them Good. No, no,
Friday, (says I) you shall go without me, leave me here to live by
myself, as I did before. He looked confus'd again at that Word, and
running to one of the Hatchets which he used to wear, he takes it up
hastily, comes and gives it me. What must I do with this? says I to
him. You take, kill Friday (says he.) Whatmust Ikill'you for? said
I again. He returns very quick, What you send Friday away for?
take, kill Friday, no send Friday away. This he spoke so earnestly,
that I saw Tears stand in his Eyes: In a Word, I so plainly dis-
cover'd the utmost Affection in him to me, and a firm Resolution in
him, that I told him then, and often after, that I would never send
him away from me, if he was willing to stay with me.
Upon ihe whole, as I found by all his Discourse a settled Affection
to me, and that nothing should part him from me, so I found all the
Foundation of his Desire to go to his own Country, was laid in his
ardent Affection to the People, and his Hopes of my doing them good;
a Thing which as I had no Notion of myself, so I had not the least
Thought or Intention, or Desire of undertaking it But still I founo.
a strong Inclination to my attempting an Escape as above, founded on
the Supposition gather'd from the Discourse, (viz.) That there were
seventeen bearded Men there; and therefore, without any more Delay,
I went to Work with Friday to find out a great Tree proper to fell, and
make a large Periagua or Canoe to undertake the Voyage. There
were Trees enough in the Island to have built a little Fleet, not of
Periaguas and Canoes, but even of good large Vessels. But the
main Thing I looked at, was to get one so near the Watei that we
might launch it when it was made, to avoid the Mistake I committed
at first
At last, Friday pitched upon a Tree, for I found he knew muck
better than I what kind of Wood was fittest for it, nor can I tell to
this Day what Wood to call the Tree we cut down, except that i«
was very like the Tree we call Fustic, or between that and the
Nicaragua Wood, for it was much of the same Colour and Smell
Friday was for burning the Hollow or Cavity of this Tree out to make
it for a Boat But I showed him how rather to cut it out with Tools,
which, after I had showed him how to use, he did very handily, and
in about a Month's hard Labour, we finished it, and made it very
handsome, especially when with our Axes, which I showed him how
to handle, wc cut and hewed the outside into the true Shape of t

Boat; after this, however, it cost us near a Fortnight's Time to get
her along as it were Inch by Inch upon great Rollers into *hv.
Water. But when she was in, she would have carried twenty Men
with great Ease.
When she was in the Water, and though she was so big it amazed
me to see with what Dexterity and how swift my Man Friday would
manage her, turn her, and paddle her along; so I asked him if he
would, and if we might venture over in her; Yes, he said, he venture
9ver in her very well, though great blow Wind. However, I had a
farther Design that he knew nothing of, and that was to make a Mast
«nd Sail and to fit her with an Anchor and Cable: As to a Mast,
that was easy enough to get; so I pitched upon a straight young
Cedar-Tree, which I found near the Place, and which there was great
»oj
Plenty of in the Island, and I set Friday to Work to cut it down, and
gave him Directions how to shape and order it But as to the Sail, that
was my particular Care; I knew I had old Sails, or rather Pieces of old
Sails enough; but as I had had them now six-and-twenty Years by me,
and had not been very careful to preserve them, not imagining that I
should ever have this kind of Use for them, I did not doubt but they
were all rotten, and indeed most of them were so; however, I found
two Pieces which appear'd pretty good, and with these I went to
Work, and with a
great deal of Pains,
and awkward te-
dious stitching (you
may be sure) for
Want of Needles, I
at length made a
three Corner'd ugly
Thing, like what we
call in England, a
Shoulder of Mutton
Sail, to go with a
Boom at bottom, and
a little short Sprit
at the Top, such
as usually our Ship's
Long-Boatssail with,
and such as I best
knew how to man-
age; because it was
such a one as I had
to the Boat, in which
I made my Escape
from Barbary, as
related in the first
Part of my Story.
I was near two Months performing this last Work, viz. rigging and
fitting my Mast and Sails; for I finish'd them very complete, making
& small Stay, and a Sail, or Foresail to it, to assist, if we should turn
to Windward; and which was more than all, I fixed a Rudder to the
Stern of her, to steer with; and though I was but a bungling Ship

wright, yet as I knew the Usefulness, and even Necessity of such a
Thing, I applied myself with so much Pains to do it, that at last I
brought it to pass; though considering the many dull Contrivances I
had for it that failed, I think it cost me almost as much Labour as
making the Boat
After all this was done too, I had my Man Friday to teach as to
what belong'd to the Navigation of my Boat; for though he knew
very well how to paddle a Canoe, he knew nothing what belong'd to
a Sail and a Rudder; and was the most amaz'd, when he saw me
work the Boat to and again in the Sea by the Rudder, and how the
Sail gibbed, and filled this way or that way, as the Course we sailed
changed; I say, when he saw this, he stood like one astonish'd and
amaz'd: However, with a little Use, I made all these Things familiar
to him; and he became an expert Sailor, except that as to the Com-
pass, I could make him understand very little of that On the other
hand, as there was very little cloudy Weather, and seldom or never
any Fogs in those Parts, there was the less occasion for a Compass,
seeing the Stars were always to be seen by Night, and the Shore by
Day, except in the rainy Seasons, and then nobody cared to stir
abroad, either by Land or Sea.
I was now enter'd on the seven-and-twentieth Year of my Cap-
tivity in this Place; though the three last Years that I had this Crea-
ture with me, ought rather to be left out of the Account, my Habi-
tation being quite of another kind than in all the rest of the Time.
I kept the Anniversary of my Landing here with the same Thankful-
ness to God for his Mercies, as at first; and if I had such Cause of
Acknowledgment at first; I had much more so now, having such
»dditional Testimonies of the Care of Providence over me, and the
great Hopes I had of being effectually, and speedily deliver'd; for I
had an invincible Impression upon my Thoughts, that my Deli-
verance was at hand, and that I should not be another Year in this
Placr ! However, I went on with my Husbandry, digging, planting,
fencing, as usual; I gather'd and cured my Grapes, and did every
necessary Thing as before.
The rainy Season was in the meantime upon me, when I kept
more within Doors than at other Times; so I had stowed our new
Vessel as secure as we could, bringing her up into the Creek, where
as I said, in the Beginning I landed my Rafts from the Ship, and
hauling her up to the Shore, at high Water mark, I made my Mao
Friday dig a little Dock, just big enough to hold her, and just deep
enough to give her Water enough to float in; and then when the
Tide was out, we made a strong Dam cross the End of it, to keep the
Water out; and so she lay dry, as to the Tide from the Sea; and to
keep the Rain off, we laid a great many Boughs of Trees, so thick,
that she was as well thatched as a House; and thus we waited
for the Month of November and December, in which I design'd to
make my Adventure.
When the settled Season began to come in, as the thought of my
Design return'd with the fair Weather, I was preparing daily for the
Voyage; and the first Thing I did, was to lay by a certain Quantity
of Provisions, being the Stores for our Voyage ; and intended in a
Week or a Fortnight's Time, to open the Dock, and launch out our
Boat I was busy one Morning upon something of this kind, when
I called to Friday, and bid him go to the Sea Shore, and see if he
could find a Turtle, or Tortoise, a Thing which we generally got once
a Week, for the Sake of the Eggs, as well as the Flesh: Friday had
not been long gone, when he came running back, and flew over my
outer Wall, or Fence, like one that felt not the Ground, or the Steps
he set his Feet on; and before I had time to speak to him, he cries
out to me, O Master I O Master I O SorrowI ObadI What's the
Matter, Friday, says I; O yonder, there, says he, one, two, three
Canoe I one, two, three / By his way of speaking, I concluded there
were six; but on inquiry, I found it was but three: Well, Friday,
says I, do not be frighted; so I heartened him up as well as I
could: However, I saw the poor Fellow was most terribly scared; for
nothing ran in his Head but that they were come to look for him,
and would cut him in Pieces, and eat him; and the poor Fellow
trembled so, that I scarce knew what to do with him: I comforted
him as well as I could, and told him I was in as much Danger as he,
and that they would eat me as well as him; but, says I, Friday, we
must resolve to fight them; Can you fight, Friday? Me sIwot, says he,
but there come many great Number. No matter for that, said I again,
our Guns will fright them that we do not kill; so I asked him,
Whether if I resolv'd to defend him, he would defend me, and stand
by me, and do just as I bid him? He said, Me die, when you bid die,
Master; so I went and fetched a good Dram of Rum, and gave him;
for I had been so good a Husband of my Rum, that I had a great
deal left: When he had drank it, I made him take the two Fowling-
Pieces, which we always carried, and load them with large Swan-Shot,
as big as small Pistol Bullets; then I took four Muskets, and loaded
them with two Slugs, and five small Bullets each; and my two Pistols
I loaded with a Brace of Bullets each; I hung my great Sword as
usual, naked by my Side, and gave Friday his Hatchet
When I had thus prepar'd myself, I took my Perspective-Glass,
and went up to the Side of the Hill, to see what I could discover;
and I found quickly, by my Glass, that there were one-and-twenty
Savages, three Prisoners, and three Canoes; and that their whole
Business seemed to be the triumphant Banquet upon these three
human Bodies, (a barbarous Feast indeed) but nothing more than
as I had observ'd was usual with them.
I observ'd also, that they were landed not where they had done,
when Friday made his Escape; but nearer to my Creek, where the
Shore was low, and where a thick Wood came close almost down
to the Sea: This, with the Abhorrence of the inhuman Errand
these Wretches came about, filled me with such Indignation, that
I came down again to Friday, and told him, I was resolv'd to go
down to them, and kill them all; and asked him, If he would
Stand by me? He was now gotten over his Fright, and his Spirits
being a little raised, with the Dram I had given him, he was
very cheerful, and told me, as before, he would die, when 1
bid die.
In this Fit of Fury, I took first and divided the Arms which I
had charged, as before, between us: I gave Friday one Pistol to
stick in his Girdle, and three Guns upon his Shoulder; and I took
one Pistol, and the other three myself; and in this Posture we
marched out: I took a small Bottle of Rum in my Pocket, and gave
Friday a large Bag, with more Powder and Bullet; and as to Orders,
I charged him to keep close behind me, and not to stir, or shoot, or
do anything, till I bid him; and in the meantime, not to speak a
Word: In this Posture I fetched a Compass to my Right-Hand, of
near a Mile, as well to get over the Creek, as to get into the Wood;
so that I might come within shot of them, before I should be dis-
cover'd, which I had seen by my Glass, it was easy to do.
While I was making this March, my former Thoughts returning, I
began to abate my Resolution; I do not mean, that I entertain'd
any Fear of their Number; for as they were naked, unarm'd Wretches,
it is certain I was superior to them; nay, though I had been alone;
but it occurr'd to my Thoughts, What Call? What Occasion? much
"ess, What Necessity I was in to go and dip my Hands in Blood, to
attack People, who had neither done, or intended me any Wrong?
Who as to me were innocent, and whose barbarous Customs were
their own Disaster, being in them a Token indeed of God's having
left them, with the other Nations of that Part of the World, to such
Stupidity, and to such inhuman Courses; but did not call me to take
upon me to be a Judge of their Actions, much less an Executioner of
his Justice; that whenever he thought fit, he would take the Cause
into his own Hands, and by national Vengeance punish them as a
People, for national Crimes; but that in the meantime, it was none of
my Business; that it was true, Friday might justify it, because he
was a declar'd Enemy, and in a State of War with those very parti-
cular People; and it was lawful for him to attack them; but I could
not say the same with respect to me: These Things were so warmly
pressed upon my Thoughts, all the way as I went, that I resolv'd I
would only go and place myself near them, that I might observe
their barbarous Feast, and that I would act then as God should
direct; but that unless something offer'd that was more a Call to me
than yet I knew of, I would not meddle with them.
With this Resolution I enter'd the Wood, and with all possible
Wariness and Silence, Friday following close at my Heels, I marched
till I came to the Skirt of the Wood, on the Side which was next to
them; only that one Corner of the Wood lay between me and them;
here I called softly to Friday, and showing him a great Tree, which
was just at the Corner of the Wood, I bade him go to the Tree,
and bring me Word if he could see there plainly what they were do-
ing; he did so, and came immediately back to me, and told me they
might be plainly viewed there; that they were all about their Fire,
eating the Flesh of one of their Prisoners; and that another lay bound upon
the Sand, a little from them, which he said they would kill next, and
which fired all the very Soul within me; he told me it was not one
of their Nation; but one of the bearded Men, who he had told me
of, that came to their Country in the Boat; I was filled with Horror
it the very naming the white-bearded Man, and going to the Tree,
I saw plainly by my Glass, a white Man who lay upon the Beach of
the Sea, with his Hands and his Feet tied, with Flags, or Things like
Rushes; and that he was an European, and had Clothes on.
There was another Tree, and a little Thicket beyond it, about
ADVENTURES OF
fifty Yards nearer to them than the Place where I was, which by go-
ing a little way about, I saw I might come at undiscover'd, and that
then I should be within half Shot of them; so I withheld my Passion,
though I was indeed enrag'd to the highest Degree, and going back
about twenty Paces, I got behind some Bushes, which held all the
way, till I came to the other Tree; and then I came to a little rising
Ground, which gave me a full View of them, at the Distance of about
eighty Yards.
I had now not a Moment to lose; for nineteen of the dreadful
Wretches sat upon the Ground, all close huddled together, and had
just sent the other two to butcher the poor Christian, and bring him
perhaps Limb by Limb to their Fire, and they were stooped down to

untie the Bands, at his Feet; I turned to Friday, now Iriday, said
I, do as I bid thee; Friday said he would; then Friday, says 1, do
exactly as you see me do, fail in nothing; so I set down one of
the Muskets, and the Fowling Piece, upon the Ground, and Friday
did the like by his; and with the other Musket, I took my aim at
the Savages, bidding him do the like; then asking him, If he was
ready? He said, yes; then fire at them, said I; and the same Moment
I fired also.
Friday took his Aim so much better than I, that on the Side that
he shot, he killed two of them, and wounded three more; and on
my Side, I killed one, and wounded two: They were, you may be
sure, in a dreadful Consternation; and all of them, who were not
hurt, jumped up upon their Feet, but did not immediately know
which way to run, or which way to look; for they knew not from
whence their Destruction came: Friday kept his Eyes close upon me,
that as I had bid him, he might observe what I did; so as soon as the
first Shot was made, I threw down the Piece, and took up the Fow-
ling Piece, and Friday did the like; he see me cock, and present,
he did the same again; Are you ready, Friday? said I; yes, says
he; let fly then, says I, in the Name of God, and with that I fired
again among the amaz'd Wretches, and so did Friday; and as our
Pieces were now loaded with what I called Swan-Shot, or small Pistol
Bullets, we found only two drop; but so many were wounded, that
they ran about yelling, and screaming, like mad Creatures, all bloody,
and miserably wounded, most of them; whereof three more fell
quickly after, though not quite dead.
Now Friday, says I, laying down the discharg'd Pieces, and
taking up the Musket, which was yet loaded; follow me, says I,
which he did, with a great deal of Courage; upon which I rushed
out of the Wood, and showed myself, and Friday close at my Foot,
as soon as I perceiv'd they saw me, I shouted as loud as I could,
and bade Friday do so too; and running as fast as I could, which
by the way, was not very fast, being laden with Arms as I was, I made
directly towards the poor Victim, who was, as I said, lying upon the
Scach, or Shore, between the Place where they sat, and the Sea; the
two Butchers who were just going to work with him, had left
him, at the Surprise of our first Fire, and fled in a terrible Fright,
to the Sea Side, and had jumped into a Canoe, and three more of
the rest made the same way; I turned to Friday, and bid
him step forwards, and fire at them; he understood me immediately,
and running about forty Yards, to be near them, he shot at them, and
I thought he had killed them all; for I saw them all fall of a Heap
into the Boat; though I saw two of them up again quickly: However,
he killed two of them, and wounded the third; so that he lay down
in the Bottom of the Boat, as if he had been dead.
While my Man Friday fired at them, I pulled out my Knife, and
cut the Flags that bound the poor Victim, and loosing his Hands,
and Feet, I lifted him up, and asked him in the Portuguese Tongue,
What he was? He answer'd in Latin, Christianus; but was so weak,
And faint, that he could scarce stand, or speak; I took my Bottle
->ut of my Pocket, and gave it him, making Signs that he should
drink, which he did; and I gave him a Piece of Bread, which he ate;
then I asked him, What Countryman he was? And he said EspagnoU',
wd being a little recover'd, let me know by all the Signs he could
possibly make, how much he was in my Debt for his Deliverance;
Seignior, said I, with as much Spanish as I could make up, we will
talk afterwards; but we must fight now; if you have any Strength left,
take this Pistol, and Sword, and lay about you; he took them very
thankfully, and no sooner had he the Arms in his Hands, but as if
they had put new Vigour into him, he flew upon his Murderers, like
a Fury, and had cut two of them in Pieces, in an instant; for the
Truth is, as the whole was a Surprise to them; so the poor Creatures
were so much frighted with the Noise of our Pieces, that they fell
down for mere Amazement, and Fear; and had no more Power to
attempt their own Escape, than their Flesh had to resist our Shot;
and that was the Case of those Five that Friday shot at in the Boat;
for as three of them fell with the Hurt they receiv'd, so the other two
fell with the Fright
I kept my Piece in my Hand still, without firing, being willing to
keep my Charge ready ; because I had given the Spaniard'my Pistol,
and Sword; so I called to Friday, and bade him run up to the Tree,
from whence we first fired, and fetch the Arms which lay there, that
had been discharg'd, which he did with great Swiftness; and then
giving him my Musket, I sat down myself to load all the rest agan,
and bade them come to me when they wanted: While I was loading
these Pieces, there happen'd a fierce Engagement between the Span-
iard, and one of the Savages, who made at him with one of their great
wooden Swords, the same Weapon that was to have killed him before,
if I had not prevented it: The Spaniard, who was as bold, and as
brave as could be imagin'd, though weak, had fought this Indian
a good while, and had cut him two great Wounds on his Head; but
Jhe Savage being a stout lusty Fellow, closing in with him, had
thrown him down (being faint) and was wringing my Sword out of
his Hand, when the Spaniard, though undermost, wisely quitting
the Sword, drew the Pistol from his Girdle, shot the Savage through
the Body, and killed him upon the Spot; before I, who was running
to help him, could come near him.
Friday being now left to his Liberty, pursu'd the flying Wretches
rith no Weapon in his Hand, but his Hatchet; and with tnat he
dispatch'd those three, who, as I said before, were wounded at first
*nd fallen, arJ all the rest he could come up with, and the Spaniard
coming to me for a Gun, I gave him one of the Fowling Pieces, with
which he pursu'd two of the Savages, and wounded them both; but
as he was not able to run, they both got from him into the Wood,
where Friday pursu'd them, and killed one of them; but the other
was too nimble for him, and though he was wounded, yet had
plunged himself into the Sea, and swam with all his might off to those
two who were left in the Canoe, which three in the Canoe, with one
wounded, who we know not whether he died or no, were all that es-
cap'd our Hands of one-and-twenty: The Account of the Rest is as
follows:—
3 Killed at our first Shot from the Tree.
i Killed at the next Shot
a Killed by Friday in the Boat
a Killed by Ditto, of those at first wounded.
i Killed by Ditto, in the Wood.
3 Killed by the Spaniard.
4 Killed, being found dropped here and there of their Wounds,
or killed by Friday in his Chase of them.
4 Escap'd in the Boat, whereof one wounded if not dead.
ai In all
Those that were in the Canoe, worked hard to get out of Gun-Shot,
and though Friday made two or three Shots at them, I did not find
that he hit any of them: Friday would fain have had me took one
of their Canoes, and pursu'd them; and indeed I was very anxiou?
about their Escape, lest carrying the News home to their People, the)
should come back perhaps with two or three hundred of their Canoes,
and devour us by mere Multitude; so I consented to pursue them
by Sea, and running to one of their Canoes, I jumped in, and bade
Friday follow me; but when I was in the Canoe, I was surpris'd to
find another poor Creature lie there alive, bound Hand and Foot, as
the Spaniard was, for the Slaughter, and almost dead with Fear, not
knowing what the Matter was; for he had not been able to look up
over the Side of the Boat, he was tied so hard, Neck and Heels, and
had been tied so long, that he had really but little Life in him.
I immediately cut the twisted Flags, or Rushes, which they had
bound him with, and would have helped him up; but he could not stand.
A19VENTURES OF
or speak, but groaned most piteously, believing it seems still that ho
was only unbound in order to be killed.
When Friday came to him, I bade him speak to him, and tell him
of his Deliverance, and pulling out my Bottle, made him give the
poor Wretch a Dram, which, with the News of his being deliver'd,
reviv'd him, and he sat up in the Boat; but when Friday came to
hear him speak, and look in his Face, it would have moved any one
to Tears, to have seen how Friday kissed him, embrac'd him, hugged
him, cried, laughed, hollow'd, jumped about, danced, sung, then
cried again, wrung his Hands, beat his own Face, and Head, and
then sung, and jumped about again, like a distracted Creature: It
was a good while before I could make him speak to me, or tell me
what was the Matter;
but when he came a
little to himself, he
told me, that it was
his Father.
It is not easy for
me to express how
it moved me to see
what Ecstasy and
filial Affection had
worked in this poor
Savage, at the Sight
of his Father, and
of his being de-
liver'd from Death;
nor indeed can I describe half the Extravagances of his Affection after
this; for he went into the Boat, and out of the Boat a great many
times: When he went in to him, he would sit down by him, open his
Breast, and hold his Father's Head close to his Bosom, half an Hour
together, to nourish it; then he took his Arms and Ankles, which
were numbed and stiff with the Binding, and chafed and rubbed
them with his Hands; and I perceiving what the Case was, gave him
some Rum out of my Bottle, to rub them with, which did them s
great deal of Good.
This Action put an End to our Pursuit of the Canoe, with the
other Savages, who were now gotten almost out of Sight; and it was
happy for us that we did not; for ii blew so hard within two Houw

after, and before they could be gotten a Quarter of their Way, and
continued blowing so hard all Night, and that from the North-wesf
which was against them, that I could not suppose their Boat could
live, or that they ever reached to their own Coast
But to return to Friday, he was so busy about his Father, that I
could not find in my Heart to take him off for some time: But
after I thought he could leave him a little, I called him to me, and he
came jumping and laughing, and pleased to the highest Extreme;
then I asked him, If he had given his Father any Bread? He shook
his Head, and said, None: Ugly Dog eat all up self; so I gave him a
Cake of Bread out of a little Pouch I carry'd on Purpose ; I also gave
him a Dram for himself, but he would not taste it, but carry'd it to
his Father: I had in my Pocket also two or three Bunches of my
Raisins, so I gave him a Handful of them for his Father. He had no
sooner given his Father these Raisins, but I saw him come out of the
Boat, and run away, as if he had been bewitch'd, he ran at such a
Rate; for he was the swiftest Fellow of his Foot that ever I saw; I
say, he ran at such a Rate, that he was out of Sight, as it were, in an
instant; and though I called, and hollow'd too, after him, it was all
one, away he went, and in a Quarter of an Hour, I saw him come
back again, though not so fast as he went; and as he came nearer, I
found his Pace was slacker, because he had something in his Hand.
When he came up to me, I found he had been quite Home for an
Earthen Jug or Pot to bring his Father some fresh Water, and that he had
got two more Cakes, or Loaves of Bread: The Bread he gave me,
but the Water he carry'd to his Father: However, as I was very
thirsty too, I took a little Sup of it This Water reviv'd his Father
more than all the Rum or Spirits I had given him; for he was just
fainting with Thirst
When his Father had drank, I called to him to know if there was
any Water left; he said, yes; and I bade him give it to the poor
Spaniard, who was in as much Want of it as his Father; and I sent
one of the Cakes, that Friday brought, to the Spaniard too, who was
indeed very weak, and was reposing himself upon a green Place
under the Shade of a Tree; and whose Limbs were also very stiff, and
very much swelled with the rude Bandage he had been tied with.
When I saw that upon Friday's coming to him with the Water, he sat
up and drank, and took the Bread, and began to eat, I went to
him, and gave him a Handful of Raisins; he looked up in my Face
with all the Tokens of Gratitude and Thankfulness, that could ap-
pear in any Countenance; but was so weak, notwithstanding he had
so exerted himself in the Fight, that he could not stand up upon his
Feet: he tried to do it two or three times, but was really not able,
his Ankles were so swelled and so painful to him; so I bade him sit
still and caused Friday to rub his Ankles, and bathe them with
Rum, as he had done his Father's.
I observ'd the poor affectionate Creature every two Minutes, 01
perhaps less, all the while he was here, turned his Head about, to see
if his Father was in the same Place, and Posture, as he left him sitting,
and at last he found he was not to be seen; at which he started up,
and without speaking a Word, flew with that Swiftness to him, that
one could scarce perceive his Feet to touch the Ground, as he went:
But when he came, he only found he had laid himself down to ease
his Limbs; so Friday came back to me presently, and I then spoke
to the Spaniard to let Friday help him up if he could, and lead him
lo the Boat, and then he should carry him to our Dwelling, where I
would take Care of him: But Friday, a lusty strong Fellow, took the
Spaniard quite up upon his Back, and carry'd him away to the Boat,
and set him down softly upon the Side or Gunnel of the Canoe, with
his Feet in the inside of it, and then lifted him quite in, and set him
close to his Father, and presently stepping out again, launched the
Boat off, and paddled it along the Shore faster than I could walk,
ihough the Wind blew pretty4jard too; so he brought them both safe
into our Creek; and leaving them in the Boat, runs away to fetch the
other Canoe. As he passed me, I spoke to him, and asked him,
whither he went, he told me, Go fetch more Boat; so away he went
like the Wind; for sure never Man or Horse run like him, and he had
the other Canoe in the Creek, almost as soon as I got to it by Land;
so he wafted me over, and then went to help our new Guests out
"A the Boat, which he did; but they were neither of them able to
walk; so that poor Friday knew not what to do.
To remedy this, I went to Work in my Thought, and calling to
Friday to bid them to sit down on the Bank while he came to me, I
soon made a Kind of Hand-Barrow to lay them on, and Friday and
I carry'd them up both together upon it between us: But when we
got them to the outside of our Wall or Fortification, we were at a
worse Loss than before; for it was impossible to get them over; and
I was resolv'd not to break it down: So I set to Work again; and
Friday and I, in about a Hours' time, made a very handsome Tent,
cover'd with old Sails, and above that with Boughs of Trees, being in
the Space without our outward Fence, and between that and the
Grove of young Wood which I had planted: And here we made
them two Beds of such things as I had (viz.) of good Rice-Straw,with
Blankets laid upon it to lie on, and another to cover them on each Bed.
My Island was now peopled, and I thought myself very rich in
Subjects; and it was a merry Reflection which I frequently made,
How like a King I looked. First of all, the whole Country was mj
own mere Property; so that I had an undoubted Right of Dominion.
idly, My People were perfectly subjected: I was absolute Lord and
Lawgiver; they all owed their Lives to me, and were ready to lay
down their Lives, if there had been Occasion of it, for me. It was re-
markable too, we had but three Subjects, and they were of three
different Religions. My Man Friday was a Protestant, his Father
was a Pagan and a Cannibal, and the Spaniard was a Papist: How-
ever, I allow'd Liberty of Conscience throughout my Dominions: But
this is by the Way.
As soon as I had secur'd my two weak rescued Prisoners, and
given them Shelter, and a Place to rest them upon, I began to think
of making some Provision for them: And the first thing I did, I
order'd Friday to take a yearling Goat, betwixt a Kid and a Goat,
out of my particular Flock, to be killed, when I cut off the hinder
Quarter, and chopping it into small Pieces, I set Friday to Work to
boiling and stewing, and made them a very good Dish, I assure you,
of Flesh and Broth, having put some Barley and Rice also into the
Broth; and as I cooked it without Doors, for I made no Fire within
my inner Wall, so I carry'd it all into the new Tent; and having set
a Table there for them, I sat down and eat my own Dinner also with
them, and, as well as I could, cheered them and encourag'd them; Friday
being my Interpreter, especially to his Father, and indeed to the Span-
iard too; for the Spaniard spoke the Language of the Savages pretty well.
After we had dined, or rather supped, I order'd Friday to take one
of the Canoes, and go and fetch our Muskets and other Firearms,
which for Want of time we had left upon the Place of Battle, and the
»cxt Day I order'd him to go and bury the dead Bodies of the Savages,
which lay open to the Sun, and would presently be offensive; and I
also order'd him to bury the horrid Remains of their barbarous Feast,
which I knew were pretty much, and which I could not think of doing
myself; nay, I could not bear to see them, if I went that Way: AD
which he punctually performed, and defaced the very Appearance oJ
the Savages being there; so that when I went again, I could scarce
know where it was, otherwise than by the Corner of the Wood pointing
to the Place.
I then began to enter into a little Conversation with my two new
Subjects; and first I set Friday to inquire of his Father, what he
thoughtof the Escape of <Ca& Savages in that Canoe, and whether we might
expect a Return of them with a Power too great for us to resist: His
first Opinion was, that the Savages in the Boat never could live out the
Storm which blew that Night they went off, but must of Necessity be
drowned or driven South to those other Shores where they were as
sure to be devoured as they were to be drowned if they were cast
away; but as to what they would do if they came safe on Shore, he
said he knew not; but it was his Opinion that they were so dreadfully
ighted with the Manner of their being attack'd, the Noise and the
Fire, that he believed they would tell their People, they were all
killed by Thunder and Lightning, not by the Hand of Man, and
that the two which appear'd, (viz.) Friday and me, were two Heavenly
Spirits or Furies, come down to destroy them, and not Men with
Weapons: This he said he knew, because he heard them all cry
at so in their Language to one another, for it was impossible to
them to conceive that a Man could dart Fire, and speak Thunder,
and kill at a Distance without lifting up the Hand, as was done now:
And this old Savage was in the right; for, as I understood since by
Other Hands, the Savages never attempted to go over to the Island
afterwards; they were so terrified with the Accounts given by those
four Men, (for it seems they did escape the Sea) that they believ'd
whoever went to that enchanted Island would be destroy'd with Fire
from the Gods.
This however I knew not, and therefore was under continual Ap-
prehensions for a good while, and kept always upon my Guard, me
and all my Army; for as we were now four of us, I would have
ventur'd upon a hundred of them fairly in the open Field at any Time.
In a little Time, however, no more Canoes appearing, the Fear of
their Coming wore off, and I began to take my former Thoughts of a
Voyage to the Main into Consideration, being likewise assur^ by
Friday's Father, that I might depend on good Usage from their
Nation on his Account, if I would go.
117
But my Thoughts were a little suspended, when I had
a serious Discourse with the Spaniard, and when I understood
that there were sixteen more of his Countrymen and Portuguese,
who having been cast away, and made their Escape to that Side,
lived there at Peace indeed with the Savages, but were very sore
put to it for Necessaries, and indeed for Life: I asked him all the
Particulars of their Voyage, and found they were a Spanish Ship
bound from the Rio de la Plata to the Havana, being directed to
leave their Lading there, which was chiefly Hides and Silver, and to
bring back what European Goods they could meet with there; that
they had five Portuguese Seamen on Board, whom they took out of
another Wreck; that five of their own Men were drowned when the
first Ship was lost, and that these escaped through infinite Dangers
and Hazards, and arriv'd almost starved on the Cannibal Coast,
where they expected to have been devour'd every Moment
He told me, they had some Arms with them, but they were perfectly
useless, for that they had neither Powder or Ball, the Washing of the
Sea having spoiled all their Powder but a little, which they used at
their first Landing to provide themselves some Food.
I asked him what he thought would become of them there, and if
they had formed no Design of making any Escape? He said, They
had many Consultations about it, but that having neither Vessel, or
Tools to build one, or Provisions of any kind, their Councils always
ended in Tears and Despair.
I asked him how he thought they would receive a Proposal from
me, which might tend towards an Escape? And whether, if they
were all here, it might not be done? I told him with Freedom, I
feared mostly their Treachery and ill Usage of me, if I put my Life
in their Hands; for that Gratitude was no inherent Virtue in the
Nature of Man; nor did Men always square their Dealings by the
Obligations they had receiv'd, so much as they did by the Advantages
they expected. I told him it would be very hard, that I should be
the Instrument of their Deliverance, and that they should afterwards
make me their Prisoner in New Spain, where an English Man was
certain to be made a Sacrifice, what Necessity, or what Accident
soever, brought him thither: And that I had rather be deliver'd up
to the Savages, and be devour'd alive, than fall into the merciless
Claws of the Priests, and be carry'd into the Inquisition. I added, That
pthirwise I was persuaded, if they were all here, we might, with so many
Hands, build a Bark large enough to carry us allaway,eitherto ihcBrasi/i
Southward, or to the Islands or Spanish Coast Northward: But that
if in Requital they should, when I had put Weapons into their Hands,
carry me by Force among their own People, I might be ill used foi
my Kindness to them, and make my Case worse than it was before.
He answer'd with a great deal of Candour and Ingenuity, That
their Condition was so miserable, and they were so sensible of it, that he
believed they would abhor the Thought of using any Man unkindly
*hat should contribute to their Deliverance; and that, if I pleased,
he would go to them with the old Man, and discourse with them
about it, and return again, and bring me their Answer: That he would
make Conditions with them upon their solemn Oath, That they should
be absolutely under my Leading, as their Commander and Captain;
and that they should swear upon the Holy Sacraments and the Gospel,
to be true to me, and to go to such Christian Country, as that I should
ajjree to, and no other; and to be directed wholly and absolutely by
my Orders, till they were landed safely in such Country, as I intended;
and that he would bring a Contract from them under tiieir Hands
for that Purpose.
Then he told me, he would first swear to me himself, That he
would never stir from me as long as he lived, till I gave him Orders;
and that he would take my Side to the last Drop of his Blood, if there
should happen the least Breach of Faith among his Countrymen.
He told me, they were all of them very civil honest Men, and they
were under the greatest Distress imaginable, having neither Weapons
or Clothes, nor any Food, but at the Mercy and Discretion of the
Savages; out of all Hopes of ever returning to their own Country;
and that he was sure, if I would undertake their Relief, they would
live and die by me.
Upon these Assurances, I resolv'd to venture to relieve them, if
possible, and to send the old Savage and this Spaniard over to them
to treat: But when we had gotten all things in a Readiness to go, the
Spaniard himself started an Objection, which had so much Prudence
in it on one hand, and so much Sincerity on the other hand, that I
could not but be very well satisfy'd in it; and by his Advice, put off
the Deliverance of his Comrades for at least half a Year. The Case
was thus:
He had been with us now about a Month; during which time, I
had let him see in what Manner I had provided, with the Assistance
of Providence, for my Support; and he saw evidently what Stock of
Cor n and Rice I had laid up; which as it was more than sufficient for
myself, so it was not sufficient, at least without good Husbandry, for my
Family; now it was increas'd to Number four: But much less would it
be sufficient, if his Countrymen, who were, as he said, fourteen still alive,
should come over. And least of all should it be sufficient to victual our
Vessel, if we should build one, for a Voyage to any of the Christian
Colonies of America. So he told me, he thought it would be more advis-
able, to let him and the two other, dig and cultivate some more Land, as
much as I could spare Seed to sow; and that we should wait another
Harvest, that we might have a Supply of Corn for his Countrymen
when they should come; for Want might be a Temptation to them to
disagree, or not to think themselves deliver'd, otherwise than out of
one Difficulty into another. You know, says he, the Children of
Israel, though they rejoic'd at first for their being deliver'd out of
Egypt, yet rebell'd even against God himself that deliver'd them,
when they came to want Bread in the Wilderness.
His Caution was so seasonable, and his Advice so good, that I
could not but be very well pleased with his Proposal, as well as 1
was satisfy'd with his Fidelity. So we fell to digging all four of us,
as well as the Wooden Tools we were furnish'd with permitted; and
in about a Month's time, by the End of which it was Seedtime, we
had gotten as much Land cured and trimmed up, as we sowed 22
Bushels of Barley on, and 16 Jars of Rice, which was in short all
the Seed we had to spare; nor indeed did we leave ourselves Barley
sufficient for our own Food, for the six Months that we had to expect
our Crop, that is to say, reckoning from the time we set our Seed
aside for sowing; for it is not to be supposed it is six Months in the
Ground in that Country.
Having now Society enough, and our Number being sufficient
to put us out of Fear of the Savages, if they had come, unless their
Number had been very great, we went freely all over the Island,
wherever we found Occasion; and as here we had our Escape or
Deliverance upon our Thoughts, it was impossible, at least for me,
10 have the Means of it out of mine; to this Purpose, I marked out
several Trees which I thought fit for our Work, and I set Friday and
his Father to cutting them down; and then I caused the Spaniard, to
whom I imparted my Thought on that Affair, to oversee and direct
their Work. I showed them with what indefatigable Pains I had
hewed a large Tree into single Planks, and I caused them to do the
like, till they had made about a Dozen large Planks of good Oak,
near a Foot broad, 35 Foot long, and from a Inches to 4 Inches
thick: What prodigious Labour it took up, any one may imagine.
At the same time I contriv'd to increase my little Flock of tame
Goats as much as I could; and to this Purpose, I made Friday and
the Spaniard go out one Day, and myself with Friday the next
Day; for we took our Turns; and by this Means we got above ao
young Kids to breed up with the rest; for whenever we shot the
Dam, we saved the Kids, and added them to our Flock: But above all,
the Season for curing the Grapes coming on, I caused such a prodigious
Quantity to be hung up in the Sun, that I believe, had we been at
Alicant, where the Raisins of the Sun are cured, we could have filled
60 or 80 Barrels; and these with our Bread was a great Part of our
Food, and very good living too, I assure you; for it is an exceeding
nourishing Food.
It was now Harvest, and our Crop in good Order; it was not the
most plentiful Increase I had seen in the Island, but however it was
enough to answer our End; for from our a a Bushels of Barley, we
brought in and thrashed out above a2o Bushels; and the like in Pro-
portion of the Rice, which was Store enough for our Food to the
next Harvest, though all the 16 Spaniards had been on Shore with
me; or if we had been ready for a Voyage, it would very plentifully
have victualled our Ship, to have carry'd us to any Part of the World,
that is to say, of America.
When we had thus housed and secur'd our Magazine of Corn, we
fell to Work to make more Wicker Work, (viz.) great Baskets in which
we kept it; and the Spaniard was very handy and dexterous at thL«
Part, and often blamed me that I did not make some things, foi
'Defence, of this Kind of Work; but I saw no Need of it
And now having a full Supply of Food for all the Guests I ex-
pected, I gave the Spaniard Leave to go over to the Main, to see
what he could do with those he had left behind him there. I gave
him a strict Charge in Writing, Not to bring any Man with him, who
would not first swear in the Presence of himself and of the old Savage,
That he would no way injure, fight with, or attack the Person h»
should find in the Island, who was so kind to send for them in order
to their Deliverance; but that they would stand by and defend him
against all cuch Attempts, and wherever they went, would be
entirely under and subjected by his Commands; and that this should
be put in Writing, and signed with their Hands: How we were to
have this done, when I knew they had neither Pen or Ink; that in-
deed was a Question which we never asked.
Under these Instructions, the Spaniard, and the old Savage the
Father of Friday, went away in one of the Canoes, which they might
be said to come in, or rather were brought in, when they came as
Prisoners to be devour'd by the Savages.
I gave each of them a Musket with a Firelock on it, and about
eight Charges of Powder and Ball, charging them to be very good
Husbands of both, and not to use either of them but upon urgent
Occasion.
This was a cheerful Work, being the first Measures used by me in
View of my Deliverance for now 27 Years and some Days. I gave
them Provisions of Bread, and of dried Grapes, sufficient for themselves
for many Days, and sufficient for all their Countrymen for about eight
Days' time; and wishing them a good Voyage, I saw them go, agreeing
with them about a Signal they should hang out at their Return, by
which I should know them again, when they came back, at a Distance,
before they came on Shore.
They went away with a fair Gale on the Day that the Moon was at
Full by my Account, in the Month of October: But as for an exact
Reckoning of Days, after I had once lost it, I could never recover it
again; nor had I kept even the Number of Years so punctually, as
to be sure that I was right, though as it proved, when I afterwardi.
examin'd my Account, I found I had kept a true Reckoning of Years.
It was no less than eight Days I had waited for them, when a strange
and unforeseen Accident interven'd, of which the like has not
perhaps been heard of in History: I was fast asleep in my Hutch one
Morning, when my Man Friday came running in to me, and called
aloud, Master, Master, they are come, they are come.
I jumped up, and regardless of Danger, I went out, as soon as I
could get my Clothes on, through my little Grove, which by the Way
was by this time grown to be a very thick Wood; I say, regardless of
Danger, I went without my Arms, which was not my Custom to do:
But I was surpris'd, when turning my Eyes to the Sea, I presently
saw a Boat at about a League and half's Distance, standing in for
the Shore, with a Shoulder of Mutton Sail, as they call it, and the
Wind blowing aretty fair to bring them in; also I observ'd presently,
s
that they did not come from that Side which the Shore lay on, but
from the Southernmost End of the Island: Upon this I called Friday
in, and bid him lie close, for these were not the People we looked
for, and that we might not know yet whether they were Friends or
Enemies.
In the next Place, I went in to fetch my Perspective Glass, to see
what I could make of them; and having taken the Ladder out, I
climbed up to the Top of the Hill, as I used to do when I was appre-
hensive of anything, and to take my View the plainer without being
discover'd.
I had scarce set my Foot on the Hill, when my Eye plainly disco-
ver'd a Ship lying at an Anchor, at about two Leagues and a half's
Distance from me South-south-east, but not above a League and a
half from the Shore. By my Observation it appear'd plainly to be an
English Ship, and the Boat appear'd to be an English Longboat
I cannot express the Confusion I was in, though the Joy of seeing
a Ship, and one who I had Reason to believe was Manned by my own
Countrymen, and consequently Friends, was such as I cannot describe;
but yet I had some secret Doubts hung about me, I cannot tell from
whence they came, bidding me keep upon my Guard. In the first
Place, it occurr'd to me to consider what Business an English Ship
could have in that Part of the World, since it was not the Way to or
from any Part of the World, where the English had any Traffic; and
I knew there had been no Storms to drive them in there, as in Dis-
tress; and that if they were English really, it was most probable that
they were here upon no good Design; and that I had better continue
as I was, than fall into the Hands of Thieves and Murderers.
Let no Man despise the secret Hints and Notices of Danger, which
sometimes are given him, when he may think there is no Possibility
of its being real. That such Hints and Notices are given us, I be-
lieve few that have made any Observations of things, can deny; that
they are certain Discoveries of an invisible World, and a Converse of
Spirits, we cannot doubt; and if the Tendency of them seems to be
to warn us of Danger, why should we not suppose they are from some
friendly Agent, whether supreme, or inferior, and subordinate, is
not the Question; and that they are given for our Good?
The present Question abundantly confirms me in the Justice of
this Reasoning; for had I not been made cautious by this secret
Admonition, come it from whence it will, I had been undone
226
Inevitably, and in a fai worse Condition than before, as you will see
presently.
I had not kept myself long in this Posture, but I saw the Boo*
draw near the Shore, as if they looked for a Creek to thrust in at for
the Convenience of Landing; however, as they did not come quit',
far enough, they did not see the little Inlet where I formerly landed
my Rafts; but run their Boat on Shore upon the Beach, at about
half a Mile from me, which was very happy for me; for otherwise
they would have landed just as I may say at my Door, and would
soon have beaten me out of my Castle, and perhaps have pliinder'd
me of all I had. s
When they were on Shore, I was fully satisfy'd .that they were
English Men; at least, most of them; one or two I thought were

Dutch; but it did nor prove so: There were in all eleven Men,
whereof three of them I found were unarm'd, and as I thought,
bound; and when the first four or five of them were jumped on
Shore, they took those three out of the Boat as Prisoners: One of
the three I could perceive using the most passionate Gestures of En-
treaty, Affliction and Despair, even to a kind of Extravagance; the
other two I could perceive lifted up their Hands sometimes,
and appear'd concern'd indeed, but not to such a Degree as the
first
I was perfectly confounded at the Sight, and knew not wfiat the
Meaning of it should be. Friday called out to me in Enlish, as
well as he could, O Master! You see English Mans eat Prisoner as
as well as Savage Mans. Why, says I, Friday, Do you think they art
ADVENTURES OF
a going to eat them thai? Yes, says Friday, They will eat them: No, no,
says I, Friday, / am afraid they will murder them indeed, but you may
be sure they will not eat them.
All this while I had no thought of what the Matter really was;
but stood trembling with the Horror of the Sight, expecting every Mo-
ment when the three Prisoners should be killed; nay, once I saw one
of the Villains lift up his Arm with a great Cutlass, as the Seamen
call it, or Sword, to strike one of the poor Men; and I expected to
see him fall every Moment, at which all the Blood in my Body
seemed to run chill in my Veins.
I wished heartily now for my Spaniard, and the Savage that was
gone with him; or that I had any way to have come undiscover'd

within shot of them, that I might have rescu'd the three Men; foi
I saw no Fire Arms they had among them; but it fell out to my
Mind another way.
After I had obserVd the outrageous Usage of the three Men, by
the insolent Seamen, I observ'd the Fellows run scattering about the
Land, as if they wanted to see the Country: I observ'd that the three
other Men had Liberty to go also where they pleased; but they sat
down all three upon the Ground, very pensive, and looked like Men
in Despair.
This put me in Mind of the first Time when I came on Shore, and
began to look about me: How I gave myself over for lost: Ho*
wildly I looked round me: What dreadful Apprehensions I had.:
And how I lodged in the Tree all Night for fear of being devour'd
by wild Beasts,
As I knew nothing that Night of the Supply I was to receive bj
the providential Driving of the Ship nearer the Land, by the Storms
aid Tide, by which I have since been so long nourish'd and sup
ported ; so these three poor desolate Men knew nothing how certain o\
Deliverance and Supply they were, how near it was to them, and
how effectually and really they were in a Condition of Safety, at
the same Time that they thought themselves lost, and their Case
desperate.
So little do we see before us in the World, and so much reason
have we to depend cheerfully upon the great Maker of the World,
that he does not leave his Creatures so absolutely destitute, but that in
the worst Circumstances they have always something to be thankful
for, and sometimes are nearer their Deliverance than they imagine;
nay, are even brought to their Deliverance by the Means by which
they seem to be brought to their Destruction.
It was just at the Top of High-Water when these People came on
Shore, and while partly they stood parleying with the Prisoners they
brought, and partly while they rambled about to see what kind of a
Place they were in; they had carelessly stayed till the Tide was spent,
and the Water was ebbed considerably away, leaving their Boat a-
ground.
They had left two Men in the Boat, who as I found afterwards,
having drank a little too much Brandy, fell asleep; however, one of
them waking sooner than the other, and finding the Boat too fast a-
ground for him to stir it, hollow'd for the rest who were straggling
about, upon which they all soon came to the Boat; but it was past all
their Strength to launch her, the Boat being very heavy, and the
Shore on that Side being a soft oozy Sand, almost like a Quick-
sand.
In this Condition, like true Seamen who are perhaps the least of
all Mankind given to forethought, they gave it over, and away they
strolled about the Country again; and I heard one of them say aloud
to another, calling them off from the Boat, Why let her alone, Jack,
can't ye, she will float next Tide; by which I was fully confirm'd in the
main Inquiry, of what Countrymen they were.
All this while I kept myself very close, not once daring to stir out
of my Castle any farther than to my Place of Observation, near the
Top of the Hill; and very glad I was, to think how well it was
fortify'd: I knew it was no less than ten Hours before the Boat could
be on float again, and by that Time it would be dark, and I might be
at more Liberty to see their Motions, and to hear their Discourse, if
!hey had any. v
In the meantime, I fitted myself up for a Battle, as before; though
with more Caution, knowing I had to do with another kind of Enemy
than I had at first: I order'd Friday also, who I had made an excel-
lent Marksman with his Gun, to load himself with Arms: I took
myself two Fowling Pieces, and I gave him three Muskets; my-
Figure indeed was very fierce; I had my formidable Goat-Skin Coat
on, with the great Cap I have mention'd, a naked Sword by my Side,
two Pistols in my Belt, and a Gun upon each Shoulder.
It was my Design, as I said above, not to have made any Attempt
till it was Dark : But about Two o'Clock, being the Heat of the Day,
I found that in short they were all gone straggling into the Woods, and
as I thought were laid down to Sleep. The three poor distressed
Men, too anxious for their Condition to get any Sleep, were however
set down under the Shelter of a great Tree, at about a quarter of a
Mile from me, and as I thought out of sight of any of the rest
Upon this I resolv'd to discover myself to them, and learn some-
thing of their Condition: Immediately I marched in the Figure as
above, my Man Friday at a good Distance behind me, as formidable
for his Arms as I, but not making quite so staring a Spectre-like Figure
as I did.
I came as near them undiscover'd as I could, and then before any
of them saw me, I called aloud to them in Spanish, What are ye
Gentlemen?
They started up at the Noise, but were ten times more confounded
when they saw me, and the uncouth Figure that I- made. They made
no Answer at all, but I thought I perceiv'd them just going to fly from
me, when I spoke to them in English, Gentlemen, said I, do not be sur-
pris'd at me; perhaps you may have a Friend near you when you did
not expect it He must be sent directly from Heaven then, said one oj
them very gravely to me, and pulling off his hat at the same time to
me, for our Condition is past the Help of Man. All Help is from
Heaven, Sir, said I. But can you put a Stranger in the way how to
help you, for you seem to me to be in some great Distress? I saw
you when you landed, and when you 6eemed to make Applications to
the Brutes that came with you, I saw one of them lift up his Sword to
kill you.
The poor Man with Tears, running down his Face, and trembling,
looking like one astonish'd, return'd, Am I talking to God, or Man/
Is it a real Man, or an Angel I Be in no fear about that, Sir, said I,
if God had sent an Angel to relieve you, he would have come better
Clothed, and Armed after another manner than you see me in; pray
lay aside your Fears, I am a Man, an Englishman, and dispos'd to
assist you, you see; I have one Servant only; we have Arms and
Ammunition; tell us freely, Can we serve you?—What is your
Case?
Our Case, said he, Sir, is too long to tell you, while our Murderers
are so near; but in short, Sir, I was Commander of that Ship, my
Men have Mutinied against me; they have been hardly prevail'd on
not to Murder me, and at last have set me on Shore in this desolate
Place, with these two Men with me; one my Mate, the other a
Passenger, where we expected to Perish, believing the Place to be
uninhabited, and know not yet what to think of it
Where are those Brutes, your Enemies, said I, do you know where
they are gone? There they lie, Sir, said he, pointing to a Thicket of
Trees; my Heart trembles, for fear they have seen us, and heard you
speak, if they have, they will certainly Murder us all.
Have they any Fire-Arms, said I, He answered they had only two
Pieces, and one which they left in the Boat Well then, said I, leave
the rest to me; I see they are all asleep, it is an easy thing to kill
them all; but shall we rather take them Prisoners? He told me
there were two desperate Villains among them, that it was scarce safe
to show any Mercy to; but if they were secur'd, he believ'd all the
rest would return to their Duty. I asked him, which they were?
He told me he could not at that distance describe them; but he would
obey my Orders in anything I would direct Well, says I, let us retreat
out of their View or Hearing, lest they awake, and we will resolve
further; so they willingly went back with me, till the Woods cover'd
us from them.
Look you, Sir, said I, if I venture upon your Deliverance, are you
willing to make two Conditions with me; he anticipated my Pro-
posals, by telling me, that both he and the Ship, if recover'd, should
be wholly Directed and Commanded by me in everything; and if the
Ship was not recover'd, he would live and die with me in what Part
of the World soever I would send him; and the two other Men said
the same.
Well, says I, my Conditions are but two. I. That while you stay
on this Island with me, you will not pretend to any Authority here;
and if I put Arms into your Hands, you will upon all Occasions give
them up to me, and do no Prejudice to me or mine, upon this Island,
and in the meantime be govern'd by my Orders.
i. That if the Ship is, or may be recover'd, you will carry me and
my Man to England Passage free.
He gave me all the Assurances that the Invention and Faith of
Man could devise, that he would comply with these most reasonable
Demands, and besides would owe his Life to me, and acknowledge it
upon all Occasions as long as he lived.
Well then, said I, here are three Muskets for you, with Powder and
Ball; tell me next what you think is proper to be done. He showed
all the Testimony of his Gratitude that he was able; but offer'd to
be wholly guided by me. I told him I thought it was hard venturing
anything; but the best Method I could think of was to fire upon
them at once, as they lay; and if any was not killed at the first
Volley, and offered to submit, we might save them, and so put it
wholly upon God's Providence to direct the shot
He said very modestly, that he was loth to kill them, if he could
help it, but that those two were incorrigible Villains, and had been
the Authors of all the Mutiny in the Ship, and if they escaped, we
should be all undone still; for they would go on Board, and bring
the whole Ship's Company, and destroy us all. Well then, says I,
Necessity legitimates my Advice; for it is the only Way to save our
Lives. However, seeing him still cautious of shedding Blood, I
told him they should go themselves, and manage as they found con-
venient
In the Middle of this Discourse, we heard some of them awake,
and soon after, we saw two of them on their Feet, I asked him, if
either of them were of the Men who he had said were the Heads of
the Mutiny? He said, No; Well then, said I, you may let them es-
cape, and Providence seems to have waken'd them on Purpose to
save themselves. Now, says I, if the rest escape you, it is your
Fault
Animated with this, he took the Musket, I had given him, in his
Hand, and a Pistol in his Belt, and his two Comrades with him, with
each Man a Piece in his Hand . The two Men who were with him,
going first, macv some Noise, at which one of the Seamen who was
awake, turned about, and seeing them coming, cried out to the rest;
tyit it was too late then; for the Moment he cried out, they fired;
/ mean the two Men, the Captain wisely reserving his own Piece:
They had so well aimed their Shot at the Men they knew, that one
of them was killed on the Spot, and the other very much wounded;
but not being dead, he started up upon his Feet, and called eagerly
for help to the other; but the Captain stepping to him, told him, it
was too late to cry for help, he should call upon God to forgive his
Villany, and with that Word knocked him down with the Stock of
his Musket, so that he never spoke more: There were three more in
the Company, and one of them was also slightly wounded: By this
Time I was come, and when they saw their Danger, and that it was
in vain to resist, they begged for Mercy: The Captain told them, he
would spare their Lives, if they would give him any Assurance of
their Abhorrence of the Treachery they had been guilty of, and would
swear to be faithful to him in recovering the Ship, and afterwards in
carrying her back to Jamaica, from whence they came: They gave
him all the Protestations of their Sincerity that could be desir'd, and
he was willing to believe them, and spare their Lives, which I was
not against, only that I oblig'd him to keep them bound Hand and
Foot while they were upon the Island.
While this was doing, I sent Friday with the Captain'3 Mate to
the Boat, with Orders to secure her, and bring away the Oars, and
Sail, which they did; and by and by, three straggling Men that were
(happily for them) parted from the rest, came back upon hearing the
Guns fired, and seeing their Captain, who before was their Prisoner,
now their Conqueror, they submitted to be bound also; and so our
Victory was complete.
It now remain'd, that the Captain and I should inquire into one
another's Circumstances: I began first, and told him my whole
History, which he heard with an Attention even to Amazement; and
particularly, at the wonderful Manner of my being furnish'd with
Provisions and Ammunition; and indeed, as my Story is a whole
Collection of Wonders, it affected him deeply; but when he reflected
from thence upon himself, and how I seemed to have been preserv'd
there, on purpose to save his Life, the Tears ran down his Pace, and
he could not sneak a Word more
After this Communication was at an End, I carryM hina and h!s
two Men into my Apartment, leading them in, just where I came
out, viz. At the Top of the House, where I refresh'd them with such
Provisions as I had, and showed them all the Contrivances I had
made, during my long, long inhabiting that Place.
All I showed them, all I said to them, was perfectly amazing; but
above all, the Captain admir'd my Fortification, and how perfectly 1
had conceal'd my Retreat with a Grove of Trees, which having been
now planted near twenty Years, and the Trees growing much faster
than in England, was become a little Wood, and so thick, that it was
unpassable in any Part of it, but at that one Side, where I had reserv'd
my little winding Passage into it: I told him, this was my Castle,
and my Residence; but that I had a Seat in the Country, as most
Princes have, whither I could retreat upon Occasion, and I would
show him that too another Time; but at present, our Business was
to consider how to recover the Ship: He agreed with me as to that;
but told me, he was perfectly at a Loss what Measures to take; for
that there were still six-and-twenty Hands on board, who having
enter'd into a cuTsed Conspiracy, by which they had all forfeited their
Lives to the Law, would be harden'd in it now by Desperation; and
would carry it on, knowing that if they were reduc'd, they should be
brought to the Gallows, as soon as they came to England, or to any of
the English Colonies; and that therefore there would be no attack-
ing them, with so small a Number as we were.
I mused for some Time upon what he had said, and found it was a
very rational Conclusion; and that therefore something was to be
resolv'd on very speedily, as well to draw the Men on board into
some Snare for their Surprise, as to prevent their Landing upon us,
and destroying us; upon this it presently occurr'd to me, that in a
little while the Ship's Crew wondering what was become of their
Comrades, and of the Boat, would certainly come on Shore in their
other Boat, to see for them, and that then perhaps they might come
armed, and be too strong for us; this he allow'd was rational.
Upon this, I told him the first Thing we had to do, was to stave
the Boat, which lay upon the Beach, so that they might not carry
her off; and taking everything out of her, leave her so far useless as
r»ot to be fit to swim; accordingly we went on board, took the
Arms which were left on board, out of her, and whatever else we
found there, which was a Bottle of Brandy, and another of Rum, a few
Biscuit Cakes, a Horn of Powder, and a great Lump of Sugar, in a
Piece of Canvas; the Sugar was five or six Pounds, all which was
very welcome to me, especially the Brandy, and Sugar, of which I
had none left for many Years.
When we had carry'd all these Things on Shore (the Oars, Mast,
Sail, and Rudder of the Boat, were carry'd away before, as above)
we knocked a great Hole in her Bottom, that if they had come
strong enough to master us, yet they could not carry off the
Boat
Indeed, it was not much in my Thoughts, that we could be able to
recover the Ship; but my View was that if they went away without
the Boat, I did not much question to make her fit again, to carry us
away to the Leeward Islands, and call upon our Friends, the
Spaniards, in my way, for I had them still in my Thoughts.
While we were thus preparing our Designs, and had first, by main
Strength heaved the Boat up upon the Beach, so high that the Tide
would not float her off at High-Water-Mark; and besides, had broke
a Hole in her Bottom, too big to be quickly stopped, and were sat
down musing what we should do; we heard the Ship fire a Gun, and
saw her make a Waft with her Ancient, as a Signal for the Boat to
come on board; but no Boat stirred; and they fired several Times,
making other Signals for the Boat
At last, when all their Signals and Firings proved fruitless, and
they found the Boat did not stir, we saw them by the Help of my
Glasses, hoist another Boat out, and row towards the Shore; and we
found as they approach'd, that there were no less than ten Men in
her, and that they had Firearms with them.
As the Ship lay almost two Leagues from the Shore, we had a full
View of them as they came, and a plain Sight of the Men even of
their Faces, because the Tide having set them a little to" the East
of the other Boat, they rowed up under Shore, to come to
the same Place, where the other had landed, and where the Boat
lay.
By this Means, I say, we had a full View of them, and the Captain
knew the Persons and Characters of all the Men in the Boat, of whcm
he said, that there were three very honest Fellows, who he was sure
were led into this Conspiracy by the rest, being overpower'd and
frighted.
But that as for the Boatswain, who it seems was the chief Officer
among them, and all the rest, they were as outrageous as any of the
Ship's Crew, and were no doubt made desperate in their new Enter
prise, and terribly apprehensive he was, that they would be too
powerful for us.
I smiled at him, and told him, that Men in our Circumstances were
past the Operation of Fear: That seeing almost every Condition that
could be, was better than that which we were suppos'd to be in, we
ought to expect that the Consequence, whether Death or Life, would
be sure to be a Deliverance: I asked him, What he thought of the
Circumstances of my Life? And, Whether a Deliverance were not
worth venturing for? And where, Sir, said I, is your Belief of my
being preserv'd here on purpose to save your Life, which elevated you
a little while ago? For my Part, said I, there seems to be but one
Thing amiss in all the Prospect of it; Whafs that? Says he; why,
said I, it is, that as you say, there are three or four honest Fellows
among them, which should be spared; had they been all of the wicked
Part of the Crew, I should have thought God's Providence had singled
them out to deliver them into your Hands; for depend upon it, every
Man of them that comes a-shore are our own, and shall die, or live, as
they behave to us.
As I spoke this with a raised Voice and cheerful Countenance, I
found it greatly encourag'd him; so we set vigorously to our Business:
We had upon the first Appearance of the Boat's coming from the Ship,
consider'd of separating our Prisoners, and had indeed secur'd them
effectually.
Two of them, of whom the Captain was less assur'd than ordinary,
I sent with Friday, and one of the three (deliver'd Men) to my Cave,
where they were remote enough, and out of Danger of being heard or
discover'd, or of finding their way out of the Woods, if they could
have deliver'd themselves: Here they left them bound, but gave them
Provisions, and promis'd them if they continu'd there quietly, to give
them their Liberty in a Day or two; but that if they attempted their
Escape, they should be put to Death without Mercy: They promis'd
faithfully to bear their Confinement with Patience, and were very
thankful that they had such good Usage, as to have Provisions, and a
Light left them; for Friday gave them Candles (such as we made
ourselves) for their Comfort; and they did not know but that he stood
Sentinel over them at the Entrance.
The other Prisoners had better Usage; two of them were kept
*S3
pinion'd indeed, because the Captain was not free to trust them; but
the other two were taken into my Service upon their Captain's Recom-
mendation, and upon their solemnly engaging to live and die with us; so
with them and the three honest Men, we were seven Men, well armed;
and I made no doubt we should be able to deal well enough with the
Ten that were a coming, considering that the Captain had said, there
were three or four honest Men among them also.
As soon as they got to the Place where their other Boat lay, they
run their Boat into the Beach, and came all on Shore, hauling the
Boat up after them, which I was glad to see; for I was afraid they
would rather have left the Boat at an Anchor, some Distance from the
Shore, with some Hands in her, to guard her; and so we should not
be able to seize the Boat

Being on Shore, the first Thing they did, they ran all to their other
Boat, and it was easy to see that they were under a great Surprise, to
find her stripped as above, of all that was in her, and a great hole in
her Bottom.
After they had mused a while upon this, they set up two or three
great Shouts, hollowing with all their might, to try if they could make
their Companions hear; but all was to no purpose: Then they came
all close in a Ring, and fired a Volley of their small Arms, which
indeed we heard, and the Echoes made the Woods ring; but it was
all one, those in the Cave we were sure could not hear, and those in
our keeping, though they heard it well enough, yet durst give no
Answer to them.
They were so astonish'd at the Surprise of this, that as they told us
afterwards, they resolv'd to go all on board again to their Ship, and
ADVENTURES OF
let them know that the Men were all murder'd, and the Long-Boat
staved; accordingly they immediately launched their Boat again and
gat all of them on board.
The Captain was terribly amaz'd, and even confounded at this,
believing they would go on board the Ship again, and set Sail, giving
their Comrades for lost, and so he should still lose the Ship, which
he was in Hopes we should have recover'd; but he was quickly as
much frighted the other way.
They had not been long put off with the Boat, but we perceiv'd
them all coming on Shore again; but with this new Measure in their
Conduct, which it seems they consulted together upon, viz. To leave
three Men in the Boat, and the rest go on Shore, and go up into the
Country to look for their FellGws.
This was a great Disappointment to us; for now we were at a Loss
what to do; for our seizing those seven Men on Shore would be no Ad-

vantage to us, if we let the Boat escape ; because they would then rcw
away to the Ship, and then the rest of them would be sure to weigh
and set Sail, and so our recovering the Ship would be lost
However, we had no Remedy, but to wait and see what the Issue
of Things might present; the seven Men came on Shore, and the
three who remain'd in the Boat, put her off to a good Distance from
the Shore, and came to an Anchor to wait for them; so that it waC
impossible for us to come at them in the Boat
Those that came on Shore, kept close together, marching toward*
the Top of the little Hill, under which my Habitation lay; and w«
could see them plainly, though they could not perceive us: We coula
have been very glad they would have come nearer to us, so that we
*3S
might have fired at them, or that they would have gone father off,
that we might have come abroad.
But when they were come to the Brow of the Hill, where they could
see a great way into the Valleys and Woods, which lay towards the
North-East Part, and where the Island lay lowest, they shouted, and
hollow'd, till they were weary; and not caring it seems to venture
far from the Shore, nor far from one another, they sat down together
under a Tree, to consider of it: Had they thought fit to have gone
to sleep there, as the other Party of them had done, they had done
the Job for us: but they were too full of Apprehensions of Danger, to
venture to go to sleep, though they could not tell what the Danger was
they had to fear neither.
The Captain made a very just Proposal to me, upon this Consulta-
tion of theirs, viz. That perhaps they would all fire a Volley again, to
endeavour to make their Fellows hear, and that we should all Sally
upon them, just at the Juncture when their Pieces were all discharg'd,
and they would certainly yield, and we should have them without
Bloodshed: I liked the Proposal, provided it was done while we
were near enough to come up to them, before they could load their
Pieces again.
But this Event did not happen, and we lay still a long Time, very
irresolute what Course to take; at length I told them, there would be
nothing to be done in my Opinion till Night, and then if they did not
return to the Boat, perhaps we might find a way to get between them,
and the Shore, and so might use some Stratagem with them in the
Boat, to get them on Shore.
We waited a great while, though very impatient for their removing;
and were very uneasy, when after long Consultations, we saw them
start all up, and march down toward the Sea: It seems they had such
dreadful Apprehensions upon them, of the Danger of the Place, that
they resolv'd to go on board the Ship again, give their Companions
over for lost, and so go on with their intended Voyage with the
Ship.
As soon as I perceiv'd them go towards the Shore, I imagin'd it to
be as it really was, That they had given over their Search, and were
for going back again; and the Captain, as soon as I told him my
Thoughts, was ready to sink at the Apprehensions of it; but 1
presently thought of a Stratagem to fetch them back again, and whick
•nswer'd my End to a Tittle.
I order"d Friday, and the Captain's Mate, to go over the little
Creek Westward, towards the Place where the Savages came on
Shore, when Friday was rescu'd; and as soon as they came to a
little rising Ground, at about half a Mile Distance, I bade them hol-
low, as loud as they could, and wait till they found the Seamen
heard them; that as soon as ever they heard the Seamen answer
them, they should return it again, and then keeping out of Sight,
take a round, always answering when the other hollow'd, to draw them
as far into the Island, and among the Woods, as possible, and then
wheel about again to me, by such ways as I directed them.
They were just going into the Boat, when Friday and the Mate
hollow'd, and they presently heard them, and answering, run along
the Shore Westward, towards the Voice they heard, when they were
presently stopped by the Creek, where the Water being up, they
could not get over, and called for the Boat to come up, and set them
over, as indeed I expected.
When they had set themselves over, I observ'd, that the Boat being
gone up a good way into the Creek, and as it were, in a Harbour
within the Land, they took one of the three Men out of her to go
along with them, and left only two in the Boat, having fastened her to
the Stump of a little Tree on the Shore.
This was what I wished for, and immediately leaving Friday and
the Captain's Mate to their Business, I took the rest with me, and
crossing the Creek out of their Sight, we surpris'd the two Men before
they were aware; one of them lying on Shore, and the other being in
the Boat; the Fellow on Shore, was between sleeping and waking,
and going to start up, the Captain who was foremost, ran in upon
him, and knocked him down, and then called out to him in the Boat,
to yield, or he was a dead Man.
There needed very few Arguments to persuade a single Man to
yield, when he saw five Men upon him, and his Comrade knocked
down; besides, this was it seems one of the three who were not so
hearty in the Mutiny as the rest of the Crew, and therefore was easily
persuaded, not only to yield, but afterwards to join very sincere
with us.
In the meantime, Friday and the Captain's Mate so well manag'd
their Business with the rest, that they drew them by hollowing and
answering, from one Hill to another; and from one Wood to another,
till they not only heartily tired them, but l«ft them, where they were
very sure they could not reach back to the Boat, before it was dark;
and indeed they were heartily tired themselves also by the Time they
came back to us.
We had nothing now to do, but to watch for them, in the Dark, and
fall upon them, so as to make sure work with them.
It was several Hours after Friday came back to me, before they
came back to their Boat; and we could hear the foremost of them
long before they came quite up, calling to those behind to come
along, and could also hear them answer and complain, how lame and
tired they were, and not able to come any faster, wuich was very
Welcome News to us.
At length they came up to the Boat; But it is impossible to
express their Confusion, when they found the Boat fast aground in
the Creek, the Tide ebbed out, and their two Men gone: We could
hear them call to one another in a most lamentable Manner, telling
one another, they were gotten into an enchanted Island; that either
there were Inhabitants in it, and they should all be murder'd, or else
there were Devils and Spirits in it, and they should be all carry'd
away, and devour'd.
They hallow'd again, and called their two Comrades by their Names,
a great many times, but no Answer. After some time, we could see
them, by the little Light there was, run about wringing their Hands
like Men in Despair; and that sometimes they would go and sit down
in the Boat to rest themselves, then come ashore again, and walk
about again, and so over the same thing again.
My Men would fain have me given them Leave to fall upon them at
once in the Dark; but I was willing to take them at some Advantage,
so to spare them, and kill as few of them as I could; and especially
I was unwilling to hazard the killing any of our own Men, knowing
the other were very well armed. I resolved to wait to see if they did
not separate; and therefore to make sure of them, I drew my Ambus-
cade nearer, and order'd Friday and the Captain, to creep upon their
Hands and Feet as close to the Ground as they could, that they
might not be discover'd, and get as near them as they could possibly,
before they offered to fire.
They had not been long in that Posture, but that the Boatswain,
who was the principal Ringleader of the Mutiny, and had now shown
himself the most dejected and dispirited of all the rest, came walking
towards them with two more of their Crew: the Captain was so eager,
as having this principal Rogue so much in his Power, that he could
hardly have Patience to let him come so near, as to be sure of
him; for they only heard his Tongue before: But when they came
aearer, the Captain and Friday starting up on their Feet, let fly at
them.
The Boatswain was killed upon the Spot, the next Man was shot
into the Body, and fell just by him, though he did not die till an Hour
or two after; and the third run for it
At the Noise of the Fire, I immediately advanc'd with my whole
Army, which was now 8 Men, viz. myself Generalissimo, Friday my
Lieutenant-General, the Captain and his two Men, and the three
Prisoners of War, whom we had trusted with Arms.
We came upon them indeed in the Dark, so that they could not see
our Number; and I made the Man we had left in the Boat, who was
now one of us, call to them by Name, to try if I could bring them to
a Parley, and so might perhaps reduce them to Terms, which fell oui
just as we desir'd: For indeed it was easy to think, as their Condi-
tion then was, they would be very willing to capitulate; so he calls
out as loud as he could, to one of them, Tom Smith, Tom Smith;
Tom Smith answered immediately, Who's that, Robinson ? for it seems
he knew his Voice : The other answered Ay, ay; for God's sake, Tom
Smith, throw down your Arms, and yield, or you are all dead Men this
Moment.
Who must we yield to? where are they? (says Smith again;) Here
they are, says he, here's our Captain, and fifty Men with him, have
been hunting you this two Hours; the Boatswain is killed, WillFrye
is wounded, and I am a Prisoner; and if you do not yield, you are
all lost
Will they give us Quarter then, (says Tom Smith) and we will yield?
I'll go and ask, if you promise to yield, says Robinson; so he asked the
Captain, and the Captain then calls himself out, You Smith, you know
my Voice, if you lay down your Arms immediately, and submit, you
shall have your Lives all but Will. Atkins.
Upon this, Will. Atkins cried out, For God's sake, Captain, give me
Quarter, what have I done? They have been all as bad as I, which by
the Way was not true neither; for it seems this Will. Atkins was the
first Man that laid hold of the Captain, when they first mutiny'd, and
nsed him barbarously, in tying his Hands, and giving him injurious
Language. However, the Captain told him he must lay down his
Arms at Discretion, and trust to the Governor's Mercy, by which he
meant me; for they all called me Governor.
In a Word, they all laid down their Arms, and begged their Lives;
and I sent the Man that had parley'd with them, and two more, who
bound them all; and then my Great Army of 50 Men, which particu-
larly with those three, were all but eight, came up and seized upon
them all, and upon their Boat, only that I kept myself and one more
1 out of Sight, for Reasons of staet
Our next Work was to repair the Boat, and think of seizing the
Ship; and as for the Captain, now he had Leisure to parley with them:
He expostulated with them upon the Villany of their Practices with
him, and at length upon the farther Wickedness of their Design, and
how certainly it must bring them to Misery and Distress in the End,
and perhaps to the Gallows.
They all appear'd very penitent, and begg'd hard for their Lives;
as for that, he told them, they were none of his Prisoners, but the
Commander of the Island, that they thought they had set him on
Shore in a barren uninhabited Island, but it had pleased God so to
direct them, that the Island was inhabited, and that the Governor was
an English Man; that He might hang them all there, if he
pleased; but as he had given them all Quarter, he supposed he would
send them to England to be dealt with there, as Justice requir'd, except
Atkins, who he was commanded by the Governor to advise to prepare
for Death; for that he would be hang'd in the Morning.
Though this was all a Fiction of his own, yet it had its desired
Effect; Atkins fell upon his Knees to beg the Captain to intercede
with the Governor for his Life; and all the rest begged of him for
God's sake, that they might not be sent to England.
It now occurr'd to me that the time of our Deliverance was come,
and that it would be a most easy thing to bring these Fellows in, to
be hearty in getting Possession of the Ship; so I retir'd in the Dark
from them, that they might not see what Kind of a Governor they had,
and called the Captain to me; when I called, as at a good Distance,
one of the Men was order'd to speak again, and say to the Captain,
Captain, the Commander calls for you; and presently the Captain reply'd,
Tell his Excellency, I am just a coming: This more perfectly amused
them; and they all believed that the Commander was just by witli his
fifty Men.
Upon the Captain's coming to me, I told him my Project for seiz-
ing the Ship, which he liked of wonderfully well, and resolv'd to put
u in Execution the next Morning.
But in Order to execute it with more Art, and secure of Success, ]
bid him, we must divide the Prisoners, and that he should go and
take Atkins and two more of the worst of them, and send them pin-
ion'd to the Cave where the others lay: This was committed to
Friday and the two Men who came on Shore with the Captain.
They convey'd them to the Cave, as to a Prison; and it was indeed
a dismal Place, especially to Men in their Condition.
The other I order'd to my Bower, as I called it, of which I have
given a full Description; and as it was fenced in, and they pinion'd, the
Place was secure enough, considering th; were upon their Behaviour
To these in the Morning I sent the Captain, who was to enter into
a Parley with them, in a Word io try them, and tell me, whether he
thought they might be trusted or no, to go on Board and surprise the
Ship. He talked to them of the Injury done him, of the Condition
they were brought to; and that though the Governor had given them
Quarter for their Lives, as to the present Action, yet that if they were
sent to England, they would all be hanged in Chains, to be sure; but
that if they would join in so just an Attempt, as to recover the Ship,
he would have the Governor's Engagement for their Pardon.
Any one may guess how readily such a Proposal would be accepted
by Men in their Condition; they fell down on their Knees to the
Captain, and promised with the deepest Imprecations, that they would
be faithful to him to the last Drop, and that they should owe their
Lives to him, and would go with him all over the World, that they
would own him for a Father to them as long as they lived.
Well, says the Captain, I must go and tell the Governor what you
say, and see what I can do to bring him to consent to it: So he
brought me an Account of the Temper he found them in; and that
he verily believ'd they would be faithful.
However, that we might be very secure, I told him he should go
back again, and choose out those five, and tell them, they might see
that he did not want Men, that he would take out those five to be
his Assistants, and that the Governor would keep the other two,
and the three that were sent Prisoners to the Castle, (my Cave) as
Hostages, for the Fidelity of those five; and that if they proved un-
faithful in the Execution, the five Hostages should be hanged in
Chains alive upon the Shore.
This looked severe, and convinc'd them that the Governor was ia
Earnest; however they had no Way left them, but to accept it; and
it was now the Business of the Prisoners, as much as of the Captain,
to persuade the other five to do their Duty.
Our Strength was now thus ordered for the Expedition: i. The
Captain, his Mate, and Passenger, a. Then the two Prisonels of the
first Gang, to whom having their Characters from the Captain, I had
given their Liberty, and trusted them with Arms. 3. The other two
whom I had kept till now, in my Bower, pinion'd; but upon the
Captain's Motion, had now releas'd. 4. These five releas'd at last:
So that they were twelve in all, besides five we kept Prisoners in the
Cave, for Hostages.
I asked the Captain, if he was willing to venture with these Hands
on Board the Ship; for as for me and my Man Friday, I did not
think it was proper for us to stir, having seven Men left behind;
and it was Employment enough for us to keep them asunder, and
supply them with Victuals.
As to the five in the Cave, I resolv'd to keep them fast, but Friday
went in twice a Day to them, to supply them with Necessaries; and
I made the other two carry Provisions to a certain Distance, where
Friday was to take it
When I showed myself to the two Hostages, it was with the Cap-
tain, who told them, I was the Person the Governor had order'd to
look after them, and that it was the Governor's Pleasure they should
not stir anywhere, but by my Direction; that if they did, they should
be fetched into the Castle, and be laid in Irons; so that as we never
suffered them to see me as Governor, so I now appear'd as another
Person, and spoke of the Governor, the Garrison, the Castle, and the
like, upon all Occasions.
The Captain now had no Difficulty before him, but to furnish his
two Boats, stop the Breach of one, and Man them. He made his
Passenger Captain of one, with four other Men; and himself, and his
Mate, and five more, went in the other: And they contriv'd then-
Business very well; for they came up to the Ship about Mid-
night: As soon as they came within Call of the Ship, he made
Robinson hail them, and tell them they had brought off the Men and
the Boat, but that it was a long time before they had found them,
and the like; holding them in a Chat till they came to the Ship's
Side; when the Captain and the Mate entering first with their Arms,
immediately knocked down the second Mate and Carpenter, with
the Butt-end of their Muskets, being very faithfully seconded by their
Men, they secur'd all the rest that were upon the Main and Quarter
Decks, and began to fasten the Hatches to keep them down who
were below, when the other Boat and their Men entering at the fore
Chains, secur'd the Forecastle of the Ship, and the Scuttle which
went down into the Cook-Room, making three Men they found there,
Prisoners.
When this was done, and all safe upon Deck, the Captain order'd
the Mate with three Men to break into the Round-House where the
new Rebel Captain lay, and having taken the Alarm, was gotten up,
and with two Men and a Boy had gotten Fire Arms in their Hands,
and when the Mate with a Crow split open the Door, the new Cap-
tain and his Men fired boldly among them, and wounded the Mate
with a Musket Ball, which broke his Arm, and wounded two more
of the Men but killed nobody.
The Mate calling for Help, rushed however into the Round-House,
wounded as he was, and with his Pistol shot the new Captain through
the Head, the Bullet entering at his Mouth, and came out again be-
hind one of his Ears; so that he never spoke a Word; upon which
the rest yielded, and the Ship was taken effectually, without any
more Lives lost
As soon as the Ship was thus secur'd, the Captain order'd seven
Guns to be fired, which was the Signal agreed upon with me, to give
me Notice of his Success, which you may be sure I was very glad to
hear, having sat watching upon the Shore for it till near two o'clock
in the Morning.
Having thus heard the Signal plainly, I laid me down; and it
having been a Day of great Fatigue to me, I slept very sound, till I
was something surpris'd with the Noise of a Gun; and presently
starting up, I heard a Man call me by the Name of Governor, and
presently I knew the Captain's Voice, when climbing up to the Top
of the Hill, there he stood, and pointing to the Ship, he embrac'd
me in his Arms, My dear Friend and Deliverer, says he, therisyottr
Ship, for she is all yours, and so are we and all that belong to her. I
cast my Eyes to the Ship, and there she rode within little more than
half a Mile of the Shore; for they had weighed her Anchor as soon
as they were Masters of her; and the Weather being fair, had brought
her to an Anchor just against the Mouth of the little Creek; and the
Tide being up, the Captain had brought the Pinnace in near the
Place where I at first landed my Rafts, and so landed just at my
Door.
I was at first ready to sink down with the Surprise. For I saw my
Deliverance indeed visibly put into my Hands, all things easy, and
a large Ship just ready to carry me away whither I pleased to go.
At first, for some time, I was not able to answer him one Word; but
as he had taken me in his Arms, I held fast by him, or I should
have fallen to the Ground.
He perceived the Surprise, and immediately pulls a Bottle out of
his Pocket, and gave me a Dram of Cordial, which he had brought
on Purpose for me; after I had drank it, 1 sat down upon the
Ground; and though it brought me to myself, yet it was a good
while before I could speak a Word to him.
All this while the poor Man was in as great an Ecstasy as I, only
not under any Surprise, as I was; and he said a thousand kind tender
things to me, to compose me and bring me to myself; but such was
the Flood of Joy in my Breast, that it put all my Spirits into Con-
tusion, at last it broke out into Tears, and in a little while after, I
recovered my Speech.
Then I took my Turn, and embrac'd him as my Deliverer; and
we rejoic'd together. I told him, I looked upon him as a Man sent
fromHeavento deliver me, and thatthewhole Transaction seemed to be
a Chain of Wonders; that such things as these were the Testimonies
we had of a secret Hand of Providence governing the World, and an
Evidence, that the Eyes of an infinite Power could search into the
remotest Corner of the World, and send Help to the Miserable when-
ever he pleased.
I forgot not to lift up my Heart in Thankfulness to Heaven, and
what Heart could forbear to bless him, who had not only in a
miraculous Manner provided for one in such a Wilderness, and in
such a desolate Condition, but from whom every Deliverance must
always be acknowledged to proceed.
When we had talked a while, the Captain told me, he had brought
me some little Refreshment, such as the Ship afforded, and such as
the Wretches that had been so long his Masters had not plunder'd
him of: Upon this he called aloud to the Boat, and bid his Men
bring the things ashore that were for the Governor; and indeed it
was a Present, as if I had been one not that was to be carry'd away
ADVENTURES OF
along with them, but as if I had been to dwell upon the Island still,
and they were to go without me.
First he had brought me a Case of Bottles full of excellent Cordial
Waters, six large Bottles of Madeira Wine; the Bottles held two
Quarts apiece; two Pound of excellent good Tobacco, twelve good
Pieces of the Ship's Beef, and six Pieces of Pork, with a Bag of
Pease, and about a hundred Weight of Biscuit
He brought me also a Box of Sugar, a Box of Flour, a Bag full of
Lemons, and two Bottles of Lime-juice, and Abundance of other
things: But besides these, and what was a thousand times more
useful to me, he brought me six clean new Shirts, six very good
Neckcloths, two Pair of Gloves, one Pair of Shoes, a Hat, and one
Pair of Stockings, and a very good Suit of Clothes of his own, which
had been worn but very little: In a Word, he clothed me from Head
to Foot
It was a very kind and agreeable Present, as any one may imagine,
to one in my Circumstances: But never was anything in the World
of that Kind so unpleasant, awkward, and uneasy, as it was to me to
wear such Clothes at their first putting on.
Aftei tfiese Ceremonies past, and after all his good things were
brought 'Oto my little Apartment, we began to consult what was to
be done with the Prisoners we had; for it was worth considering
whether we might venture to take them away with us or no, especially
two of them, who we knew to be incorrigible and refractory to the
last Degree; and the Captain said, he knew tiiey were such Rogues,
that there was no obliging them, and if he did cany them away, it
must be in Irons, as Malefactors to be delivered over to Justice at
the first English Colony he could come at; and I found that the
Captain himself was very anxious about it
Upon this, I told him, that if he desir^ it, I durst undertake to
bring the two Men he spoke of, to make it their own Request that
he should leave them upon the Island: / should be very glad of that,
says the Captain, with all my Heart.
Well, says I, I will send for them up, and talk with them for you;
so I caused Friday and the two Hostages, for they were now dis-
charg'd, their Comrades having perform'd their Promise; I say, I
caused them to go to the Cave, and bring up the five Men pinion'd,
as they were, to the Bower, and keep them there till I came.
After some time, I came thither dressed in my new Habit, and
now I was called Governor again; being all met, and the Captain
with me, I caused the Men to be brought before me, and I told them,
I had had a full Account of their villanous Behaviour to the Captain,
and how they had run away with the Ship, and were preparing to
commit farther Robberies, but that Providence had ensnar'd them in
their own Ways, and that they were fallen into the Pit which they
had digged for others.
I let them know, that by my Direction the Ship had been seized,
that she lay now in the Road; and they might see by and by, that
their new Captain had receiv'd the Reward of his Villany; for that
they might see him hanging at the Yard-arm.
That as to them, I wanted to know what they had to say, why I
should not execute them as Pirates taken in the Fact, as by my Com-
mission they could not doubt I had Authority to do.
One of them answer'd in the Name of the rest, That they had
nothing to say but this, That when they were taken, the Captain
promis'd them their Lives, and they humbly implor'd my Mercy;
But I told them, I knew not what Mercy to show them; for as for
myself, I had resolv'd to quit the Island with all my Men, and had
taken Passage with the Captain to go for England: And as for the
Captain, he could not carry them to England, other than as Prisoners
in Irons to be tried for Mutiny, and running away with the Ship; the
Consequence of which, they must needs know, would be the Gallows;
so that I could not tell which was best for them, unless they had a
Mind to take their Fate in the Island; if they desir'd, that I did not
care, as I had Liberty to leave it, I had some Inclination to give
them their Lives, if they thought they could shift on Shore.
They seemed very thankful for it, said they would much rather
venture to stay there, than to be cany'd to England to be hanged ,
so I left it on that Issue.
However, the Captain seemed to make some Difficulty of it, as if
he durst not leave them there: Upon this I seemed a little angry
with the Captain, and told him, That they were my Prisoners, not
his; and that seeing I had offered them so much Favour, I would be
as good as my Word; and that if he did not think fit to consent to
it, I would set them at Liberty, as I found them; and if he did not
like it, he might take them again if he could catch them.
Upon this they appear'd very thankful, and I accordingly set them
at Liberty, and bade them retire into the Woods to the Place whence
they came, and I would leave them some Fire Arms, some Ammuni-
tion, and some Directions how they should live very well, if they
thought fit
Upon this I prepar'd to go on Board the Ship, but told the
Captain, that I would stay that Night to prepare my things, and
desir'd him to go on Board in the meantime, and keep all right in
the Ship, and send the Boat on Shore the next Day for me; ordering
him in the meantime to cause the new Captain who was killed, to
be hanged at the Yard-arm that these Men might see him.
When the Captain was gone, I sent for the Men up to me to my
Apartment, and entered seriously into Discourse with them of their
Circumstances, I told them, I thought they had made a right
Choice; that if the Captain carry'd them away, they would certainly
be hanged. I showed them the new Captain, hanging at the Yard-
arm of the Ship, and told them they had nothing less to expect
When they had all declar'd their Willingness to stay, I then told
them, I would let them into the Story of my living there, and put
them into the Way of making it easy to them: Accordingly I gave
them the whole History of the Place, and of my coming to it;
showed them my Fortifications, the Way I made my Bread, planted
my Corn, cured my Grapes; and in a Word, all that was necessary
to make them easy: I told them the Story also of the sixteen
Spaniards that were to be expected; for whom I left a Letter, and
made them promise to treat them in common with themselves.
I left them my Fire Arms, viz. Five Muskets, three Fowling Pieces,
and three Swords. I had above a Barrel and half of Powder left;
for after the first Year or two, I used but little, and wasted none. I
gave them a Description of the Way I manag'd the Goats, and
Directions to milk and fatten them, and to make both Butter and
Cheese.
In a Word, I gave them every Part of my own Story; and I told
them, I would prevail with the Captain to leave them two Barrels of
Gunpowder more, and some Garden-Seeds, which I told them I
would have been very glad of; also I gave them the Bag of Pease
which the Captain had brought me to eat, and bade them be sure to
low and increase them.
Having done all this, I left them the next Day, and went on
Board the Ship : We prepared immediately to sail, but did not weigh
that Night: The next Morning early, two of the five Men came
swimming to the Ship's Side, and making a most lamentable Com-
plaint of the other three, begged to be taken into the Ship, for God's
Sake, for they should be murdered, and begged the Captain to take
them on Board, though he hanged them immediately.
Upon this the Captain pretended to have no Power without me;
But after some Difficulty, and after their solemn Promises of Amend-
ment, they were taken on Board, and were some time after soundly
whipped and pickled; after which, they proved very honest and
quiet Fellows.
Some time after this, the Boat was order'd on Shore, the Tide being
up, with the things promised to the Men, to which the Captain at my
Intercession caused their Chests and Clothes to be added, which
they took, and were very thankful for; I also encourag'd them, by
telling them, that if it lay in my Way to send any Vessel to take them
in, I would not forget them.
When I took leave of this Island, I carry'd on board for Relics, the
great Goat's-Skin-Cap I had made, my Umbrella, and my Parrot;
also I forgot not to take the Money I formerly mention'd, which had
lain by me so long useless, that it was grown rusty, or tarnish'd, and
could hardly pass for Silver, till it had been a little rubbed, and
handled; as also the Money I found in the Wreck of the Spanish
Ship.
And thus I left the Island, the Ninteenth of December, as I found
by the Ship's Account, in the Year 1686, after I had been upon it
eight-and-twenty Years, two Months, and 19 Days; being deliver'd
from this second Captivity, the same Day of the Month, that I first
made my Escape in the Bano-Longo, from among the Moors of
Sallu.
In this Vessel, after a long Voyage, I arriv'd in England, the
Eleventh of/une, in the Year 1687, having been thirty-and-five Years
absent
When I came to England, I was as perfect a Stranger to all the
World, as if I had never been known there. My Benefactor and
faithful Steward, who I had left in Trust with my Money, was alive;
but had had great Misfortunes in the World; was become a Widow
the second Time, and very low in the World: I made her easy as to
what she owed me, assuring her, I would give her no Trouble; but
on the contrary, in Gratitude to her former Care and Faithfulness to
me, J reliev'd her, as my little Stock would afford, which at that
Time would indeed allow me to do but little for her; but I assur'd
her, I would never forget her former Kindness to me; nor did I
forget her, when I had sufficient to help her, as shall be obseiVd in
its Place.
I went down afterwards into Yorkshire; but my Father was dead,
and my Mother, and all the Family extinct, except that I found two
Sisters, and two of the Children of one of my Brothers; and as I had
been long given over for dead, there had been no Provision made for
me; so that in a Word, I found nothing to relieve, or assist me; and
that little Money I had, would not do much for me, as to settling in
the World.
I met with one Piece of Gratitude indeed, which I did not expect;
and this was, That the Master of the Ship, who I had so happily
deliver'd, and by the same Means saved the Ship and Cargo, having
given a very handsome Account to the Owners, of the Manner how I
had saved the Lives of the Men, and the Ship, they invited me to meet
them, and some Merchants concern'd, and all together they made me
a very handsome Compliment upon the Subject, and a Present cf
almost two hundred Pounds Sterling.
But after making several Reflections upon the Circumstances of my
Life, and how little way this would go towards settling me in the
World, I resolv'd to go to Lisbon, and see if I might not come by
some Information of the State of my Plantation in the Brasils, and of
what was become of my Partner, who I had reason to suppose had
some Years now given me over for dead.
With this View I took Shipping for Lisbon, where I arrived in April
following; my Man Friday accompanying me very honestly in all
Ramblings, and proving a most faithful Servant upon all Occa-
sions.
When I came to Lisbon, I found out by Inquiry, and to my par-
ticular Satisfaction, my old Friend the Captain of the Ship, who first
took me up at Sea, off of the Shore of Africa: He was now grown
old, and had left oft" the Sea, having put his Son, who was far from a
young Man, into his Ship; and who still used the Brasil Trade.
The old Man did not know me, and indeed, I hardly knew him; but
I soon brought him to my Remembrance, and as soon brought
myself to his Remembrance, when I told him who I was.
After some passionate Expressions of the old Acquaintance, I in-
quir'd, you may be sure, after my Plantation and my Partner: The
old Man told me he had not been in the Brasils for about nine
Years; but that he could assure me, that when he came away, my
Partner was living, but the Trustees, who I had joined with him to
take Cognizance of my Part, were both dead; that however, he
believ'd that I would have a very good Account of the Improvement
of the Plantation; for that upon the general Belief of my being cast
away, and drowned, my Trustees had given in the Account of the
Produce of my Part of the Plantation, to the Procurator Fiscal, who
had appropriated it, in Case I never came to claim it; one Third to
the King, and two Thirds to the Monastery of St Augustine, to be ex
pended for the Benefit of the Poor, and for the Conversion of the
Indians to the Catholic Faith; but that if I appear'd, or any one for
me, to claim the Inheritance, it should be restor'd; only that the Im-
provement, or Annual Production, being distributed to charitable
Uses, could not be restor'd; but he assur'd me, that the Steward of
the King's Revenue (from Lands) and the Proviedore, or Steward of
the Monastery, had taken great Care all along, that the Incumbent,
that is to say my Partner, gave every Year a faithful Account of the
Produce, of which they receiv'd duly my Moiety.
I asked him if he knew to what height of Improvement he had
brought the Plantation? And, Whether he thought it might be worth
looking after? Or, Whether on my going thither, I should meet
with no Obstruction to my Possessing my just Right in the Moiety?
He told me, he could not tell exactly, to what Degree the Planta-
tion was improv'd; but this he knew, that my Partner was grown
exceeding Rich upon the enjoying but one half of it; and that to the
Dest of his Remembrance, he had heard, that the King's Third of
aiy Part, which was it seems granted away to some other Monastery,
or Religious House, amounted to above two hundred Moidores a
Year; that as to my being restor'd to a quiet Possession of it, there
was no question to be made of that, my Partner being alive to witness
rny Title, and my Name being also enrolled in the Register of the
Country; also he told me, That the Survivors of my two Trustees, were
very fair honest People, and very Wealthy; and he believ'd I would
not only have their Assistance for putting me in Possession, but would
find a very considerable Sum of Money in their Hands, for my Account,
being the Produce of the Farm while their Fathers held the Trust, and
oefore it was given up as above, which as he remember'd, was for about
twelve Years.
I showed myself a little concern'd, and uneasy at this Account, and
inquir'd of the old Captain, How it came to pass, that the Trustees
should thus dispose my Effects, when he knew that I had made my
Will, and had made him, the Portuguese Captain, my universal Heir, &c,
He told me, that was true; but that as there was no Proof of my
being dead, he could not act as Executor, until some certain Account
should come of my Death, and that besides, he was not willing to
intermeddle with a thing so remote; that it was true he had registered
my Will, and put in his Claim; and could he have given any Account
of my being dead or alive, he would have acted by Procuration, and
taken Possession of the Ingenio, so they called the Sugar-House, and
had given his Son, who was now at the Brasils, Order to do it
But, says the old Man, I have one Piece of News to tell you, which
perhaps may not be so acceptable to you as the rest, and that is,
That believing you were lost, and all the World believing so also,
your Partner and Trustees did offer to account to me in your Name,
for six or eight of the first Years of Profits, which I receiv'd; but
there being at that time, says he, great Disbursements for increasing
the Works, building an Ingenio, and buying Slaves, it did not amount
to near so much as afterwards it produced: However, says the old
Man, I shall give you a true Account of what I have received in all,
and how I have disposed of it
After a few Days' farther Conference with this ancient Friend, he
brought me an Account of the six first Years' Income of my Plan-
tation, signed by my Partner and the Merchants Trustees, being
always deliver'd in Goods, viz. Tobacco in Roll, and Sugar in
Chests, besides Rum, Molasses, &c. which is the Consequence of a
Sugar Work; and I found by this Account, that every Year the In-
come considerably increased; but as above, the Disbursement being
large, the Sum at first was small: However, the old Man let me see,
that he was Debtor to me 470 Moidores of Gold, besides 60 Chests
of Sugar, and 15 double Rolls of Tobacco which were lost in his
Ship; he having been Shipwreck'd coming Home to Lisbon about
11 Years after my leaving the Place.
The good Man then began to complain of his Misfortunes, and how
he had been obliged to make Use of my Money to recover his Losses,
and buy him a Share in a new Ship: However, my old Friend, says
he, you shall not want a Supply in your Necessity; and as soon as
my Son returns, you shall be fully satisfy'd.
Upon this, he pulls out an old Pouch, and gives me 160 Portugal
Moidores in Gold; and giving me the Writing of his Title to the Ship,
which his Son was gone to the Brasils in, of which he was a Quartet
Part Owner, and his Son another, he puts them both into my Hands
for Security of the rest
I was too much moved with the Honesty and Kindness of the poor
Man, to be able to bear this; and remembering what he had done
for me, how he had taken me up at Sea, and how generously he had
used me on all Occasions, and particularly, how sincere a Friend he
was now to me, I could hardly refrain Weeping at what he said to me:
Therefore, first I asked him, if his Circumstances admitted him to spare
so much Money at that time, and if it would not straiten him? He
told me, he could not say but it might straiten him a little; but
however it was my Money, and I might want it more than he.
Everything the good Man said was full of Affection, and I could
hardly refrain from Tears while he spoke: In short, I took 100 of the
Moidores, and called for a Pen and Ink to give him a Receipt for
tkem; then I returned him the rest, and told him, if ever I had Pos-
session of the Plantation, I would return the other to him also, as
indeed I afterwards did; and that as to the Bill of Sale of his Part in
his Son's Ship, I would not take it by any Means; but that if I wanted
the Money, I found he was honest enough to pay me; and if I did
not, but came to receive what he gave me reason to expect, I would
never have a Penny more from him.
When this was passed, the old Man began to ask me, If he should
put me into a Method to make my Claim to my Plantation? I told
him, I thought to go over to it myself: He said, I might do so if I
pleased; but that if I did not, there were Ways enough to secure my
Right, and immediately to appropriate the Profits to my Use; and as
there were Ships in the River of Lisbon, just ready to go away to
Brasil, he made me enter my Name in a Public Register, with his
Affidavit, affirming upon Oath that I was alive, and that I was the
game Person who took up the Land for the Planting the said Planta-
tion at first
This being regularly attested by a Notary, and a Procuration affix'd,
he directed me to send it with a Letter of his Writing, to a Merchant
of his Acquaintance at the Place, and then propos'd my staying with
him till an Account came of the Return.
Never anything was more honourable, than the Proceedings upon
this Procuration; for in less than seven Months, I receiv'd a large
Packet from the Survivors of my Trustees the Merchants, for whose
Account I went to Sea, in which were the following particular Letters
and Papers enclos'd.
First, There was the Account Current of the Produce of my Farm,
or Plantation, from the Year when their Fathers had balanc'd with my
old Portugal Captain, being for six Years; the Balance appear'd to
be 1174 Moidores in my Favour.
Secondly, There was the Account of four Years more while they
kept the Effects in their Hands, before the Government claimed the
Administration, as being the Effects of a Person not to be found,
which they call Civil Death; and the Balance of this, the Value of
the Plantation increasing, amounted to 3241 Moidores.
Thirdly, There was the Prior of the Augusti/tes' Account, who had
receiv'd the Profits for above fourteen Years; but not being to
account for what was dipos'd to the Hospital, very honestly declar'd
he had 87a Moidores not distributed, which he acknowledged to my
Account; as to the King's Part, that refunded nothing.
There was a Letter of my Partner's, congratulating me very affec-
tionately upon my being alive, giving me an Account how the Estate
was improv'd, and what it produced a Year, with a Particular of the
Number of Squares or Acres that it contained; how planted, how
many Slaves there were upon it, and making two-and-twenty Crosses
for Blessings, told me he had said so many Ave Marias to thank the
Blessed Virgin that I was alive; inviting me very passionately to come
over and take Possession of my own: and in the meantime to give
him Orders to whom he should deliver my Effects, if I did not come
myself; concluding with a hearty Tender of his Friendship, and that
of his Family, and sent me, as a Present, seven fine Leopards' Skins,
which he had it seems received from Africa, by some other Ship which
he had sent thither, and who it seems had made a better Voyage than
I: He sent me also five Chests of excellent Sweetmeats, and a hun-
dred Pieces of Gold uncoin'd, not quite so large as Moidores.
By the same Fleet, my two Merchant Trustees shipped me 1100
Chests of Sugar, 800 Rolls of Tobacco, and the rest of the whole
Account in Gold.
I might well say, now indeed, That the latter end of Job was better
than the Beginning. It is impossible to express here the Flutterings of
my very Heart, when I looked over these Letters, and especially when
I found all my Wealth about me; for as the Brasil Ships come all in
Fleets, the same Ships which brought my Letters, brought my Goods;
and the Effects were safe in the River before the Letters came to my
Hand. In a Word, I turned pale, and grew sick; and had not the
old Man run and fetched me a Cordial, I believe the sudden Surprise
of Joy had overset Nature, and I had died upon the Spot
Nay after that, I continu'd very ill, and was so some Hours, till a
Physician being sent for, and something of the real Cause of my Illness
being known, he order'd me to be let Blood; after which, I had
Relief, and grew well: But I verily believe, if it had not been
eased by a Vent given in that Manner, to the Spirits, I should have
died.
I was now Master, all on a Sudden, of above 5000/. Sterling in
Money, and had an Estate, as I might well call it, in the Brasils, of
above a thousand Pounds a Year, as sure as an Estate of Lands in
England: And in a Word, I was in a Condition which I scarce knew
how to understand, or how to compose myself, for the Enjoyment
of it
The first thing I did, was to recompense my original Benefactor, my
good old Captain, who had been first charitable to me in my Distress,
kind to me in my Beginning, and honest to me at the End: I showed
him all that was sent me, I told him, that next to the Providence of
Heaven, which disposes all things, it was owing to him; and that it
now lay on me to reward him, which I would do a hundred-fold: So
I first return'd to him the hundred Moidores I had receiv'd of him,
then I sent for a Notary, and caused him to draw up a general
Release or Discharge for the 470 Moidores, which he had acknowledg'd
he owed me in the fullest and firmest Manner possible; after which,
I caused a Procuration to be drawn, impowering him to be my Re-
ceiver of the annual Profits of my Plantation, and appointing my Part-
ner to account to him, and make the Returns by the usual Fleets to
him in my Name ; and a Clause in the End, being a Grant of 100 Moi-
dores a Year to him, during his Life, out of the Effects, and 50 Moidores
a Year to his Son after him, for his Life: And thus I requited my old
Man.
I was now to consider which Way to steer my Course next, and
what to do with the Estate that Providence had thus put into mj
Hands; and indeed I had more Care upon my Head now, than I
had in my silent State of Life in the Island, where I wanted nothing
but what I. had, and had nothing but what I wanted : Whereas t had
now a great Charge upon me, and my Business was how to secure it
i' had ne'er a Cave now to hide my Money in, or a Place where it
might lie without Lock or Key, till it grew mouldy and tarnish'd be-
fore anybody would meddle with it: On the contrary, I knew not
where to put it, or who to trust with it My old Patron, the Captain,
indeed was honest, and that was the only Refuge I had.
In the next Place, my Interest in the Brasils seemed to summon
me thither, but now I could not tell, how to think of going thither,
till I had settled my Affairs, and left my Effects in some safe Hands
behind me. At first I thought of my old Friend the Widow, who I
knew was honest, and would be just to me; but then she was in
Years, and but poor, and for ought I knew, might be in Debt; so
that in a Word, I had no Way but to go back to England myself,
and take my Effects with me.
It was some Months however before I resolved upon this; and there-
fore, as I had rewarded the old Captain fully, and to his Satisfaction,
who had been my former Benefactor, so I began to think of my poor
Widow, whose Husband had been my first Benefactor, and she,
while it was in her Power, my faithful Steward and Instructor. So
the first thing I did, I got a Merchant in Lisbon to write to his Cor-
respondent in London, not only to pay a Bill, but to go find her
out, and carry her in Money a hundred Pounds from me, and to
talk with her, and comfort her in her Poverty, by telling her she
should, if I lived, have a further Supply: At the same time I sent my
two Sisters in the Country, each of them a Hundred Pounds, they be-
ing though not in Want, yet not in very good Circumstances; one
having been marry'd and left a Widow; and the other having a Hus-
band not so kind to her as he should be.
But among all my Relations, or Acquaintances, I could not yet
pitch upon one, to whom I durst commit the Gross of my Stock, that
I might go away to the Brasils, and leave things safe behind me; and
this greatly perplex'd me.
I had once a Mind to have gone to the Brasils, and have settled my-
self there ; for I was, as it were, naturaliz'd to the Place; but I had some
little Scruple in my Mind about Religion, which insensibly drew me
back, of which I shall say more presently. However, it was not
Religion that kept me from going there for the present; and as I had
made no Scruple of being openly of the Reli/nVn ->f the Country, aD
the while I was among them, so neither did I yet; only that now
and then having of late thought more of it, (than formerly) when I
began to think of living and dying among them, I began to regret
my having profess'd myself a Papist, and thought it might not be the
best Religion to die with.
But as I have said, this was not the main thing that kept me from
going to the Brasils, but that really I did not know with whom to leave
my Effects behind me; so I resolv'd at last to go to England with it,
where, if I arrived, I concluded I should make some Acquaintance,
or find some Relations that would be faithful to me; and accord-
ing I prepar'd to go for England with all my Wealth.
In order to prepare things for my going Home, I first, the Brasil
Fleet being just going away, resolved to give Answers suitable
to the just and faithful Account of things I had from thence; and
first to the Prior of St Augustine I wrote a Letter full of Thanks for
Iheir just Dealings, and the Offer of the 872 Moidores, which was un-
disposed of, which I desir'd might be given 500 to the Monastery,
and 372 to the Poor, as the Prior should direct, desiring the good
Padres1 Prayers for me, and the like.
I wrote next a Letter of Thanks to my two Trustees, with all the
Acknowledgment that so much Justice and Honesty called for;
as for sending them any Present, they were far above having any
Occasion of it
Lastly, I wrote to my Partner, acknowledging his Industry in tne
Improving the Plantation, and his Integrity in increasing the Stock
of the Works, giving him Instructions for his future Government of
my Part, according to the Powers I had left with my old Patron, to
whom I desir'd him to send whatever became due to me, till he
should hear from me more particularly; assuring him that it was my
Intention, not only to come to him, but to settle myself there for the
Remainder of my Life: To this I added a very handsome Present
of some Italian Silks for his Wife, and two Daughters, for such the
Captain's Son inform'd me he had; with two Pieces of fine English
broad Cloth, the best I could get in Lisbon, five Pieces of black
Baise, and some Flanders Lace of a good Value.
Having thus settled my Affairs, sold my Cargo, and turned all my
Effects into good Bills of Exchange, my next Difficulty was, which
Way to go to England: I had been accustom'd enough to the Sea,
and yet I had a strange Aversion to going to England by Sea
at that time; and though I could give no Reason for it, yet the
Difficulty increas'd upon me so much, that though I had once
shipped my Baggage, in order to go, yet I alter'd my Mind, and that
not once, but two or three times.
It is true, I had been very unfortunate by Sea, and this might be
some of the Reason: But let no Man slight the strong Impulses of
his own Thoughts in Cases of such Moment: Two of the Ships
which I had singled out to go in, I mean, more particularly singled
out than any other, that is to say, so as in one of them to put my
things on Board, and in the other to have agreed with the Captain;
I say, two of these Ships miscarry'd, viz. One was taken by the
Algerine, and the other was cast away on the Start near Torbay, and
all the People drowned except three; so that in either of those
Vessels I had been made miserable; and in which most, it was hard
to say.
Having been thus harass'd in my Thoughts, my old Pilot, to
whom I communicated everything, pressed me earnestly not to go
by Sea, but either to go by Land to the Groyne, and cross over the
Bay of Biscay to Rochclle, from whence it was but an easy and safe
Journey by Land to Paris, and so to Calais and Dover; or to go up
to Madrid, and so all the Way by Land through France.
In a Word, I was so prepossess'd against my going by Sea at all,
except from Calais to Dover, that I resolv'd to travel all the Way by
Land; which as I was not in Haste, and did not value the Charge, was
by much the pleasanter Way; and to make it more so, my old Cap-
tain brought an English Gentleman, the Son of a Merchant in Lisbon,
who was willing to travel with me: After which, we picked up two
more English Merchants also, and two young Portuguese Gentlemen,
the last going to Paris only; so that we were in all six of us, and
five Servants; the two Merchants and the two Portuguese, content-'
ing themselves with one Servant, between two, to save the
Charge; and as for me, I got an English Sailor to travel with me as a
Servant, besides my Man Friday, who was too much a Stranger to
be capable of supplying the Place of a Servant on the Road.
In this Manner I set out from Lisbon; and our Company being all
very well mounted and armed, we made a little Troop, whereof they
did me the Honour to call me Captain, as well because I was the
oldest Man, as because I had two Servants, and indeed was the
Original of the whole Journey.
As I have troubled you with none of my Sea-Journals, so I shall
trouble you now with none of my Land-Journal: But some Adven-
tures that happen'd to us in this tedious and difficult Journey, I must
not omit
When we came to Madrid, we being all of us Strangers to Spain,
were willing to stay some time to see the Court of Spain, and to see
what was worth observing; but it being the latter Part of the Summer,
we hasten'd away, and set out from Madrid about the Middle of
October: But when we came to the Edge of Navarre, we were alarm'd
at several Towns on the Way, with an Account, that so much Snow
was fallen on the French Side of the Mountains, that several Travellers
were obliged to come back to Pampeluna, after having attempted, at
an extreme Hazard, to pass on.
When we came to Pampeluna itself, we found it so indeed; and to
me that had been always used to a hot Climate, and indeed to
Countries where we could scarce bear any Clothes on, the Cold was
Kisufferable; nor indeed was it more painful than it was surprising, to
come but ten Days before out of the Old Castile, where the Weather
was not only warm but very hot, and immediately to feel a Wind
from the Pyrenean Mountains, so very keen, so .severely cold, as to
be intolerable, and to endanger benumbing and perishing of our
Fingers and Toes.
Poor Friday was really frighted when he saw the Mountains all
cover'd with Snow, and felt cold Weather, which he had never seen or
felt before in his Life.
To mend the Matter, when we came to Pampeluna, it continued
snowing with so much Violence, and so long, that the People said,
Winter was come before its time, and the Roads which were difficult
before, were now quite impassable: For in a Word, the Snow lay in
some Places too thick for us to travel; and being not hard frozen, as
is the Case in Northern Countries: There was no going without being
in Danger of being buried alive every Step. We stayed no less than
twenty Days at Pampeluna; when seeing the Winter coming on, and
no Likelihood of its being better; for it was the severest Winter all
over Europe that had been known in the Memory of Man, I propos'd
that we should all go away to Fontarabia, and there take Shipping for
Bourdeaux, which was a very little Voyage.
But while we were considering this, there came in four French Gen-
tlemen, who having been stopped on the French Side of the Passes,
as we were on the Spanish, had found out a Guide, who traversing the
Country near the Head of Languedoc, had brought them over the
Mountains by such Ways, that they were not much incommoded with
the Snow; and where they met with Snow in any Quantity, they said
it was frozen hard enough to bear them and their Horses.
We sent for this Guide, who told us, he would undertake to carry
us the same Way with no Hazard from the Snow, provided we were
armed sufficiently to protect ourselves from wild Beasts; for he said, upon
these great Snows, it was frequent for some Wolves to show them-
selves at the Foot of the Mountains, being made ravenous for Want
of Food, the Ground being covered with Snow : We told him, we were
well enough prepar'd for such Creatures as they were, if he would ensure
us from a Kind of two-legged Wolves, which we were told, we were in
most Danger from, especially on the French Side of the Mountains.
He satisfy'd us there was no Danger of that kind in the Way that we
were to go; so we readily agreed to follow him, as did also twelve
other Gentlemen, with their Servants, some French, some Spanish; who,
as I said, had attempted to go, and were oblig'd to come back again.
Accordingly, we all set out from Pampeluna, with our Guide, on the
fifteenth of November; and indeed, I was surpris'd, when instead o*
going forward, he came directly back with us, on the same Road that
we came from Madrid, above twenty Miles; when being passed two
Rivers, and come into the plain Country, we found ourselves in a
warm Climate again, where the Country was pleasant, and no Snow
to be seen; but on a sudden, turning to his left, he approach'd the
Mountains another Way; and though it is true, the Hills and Preci-
pices looked dreadful, yet he made so many Tours, such Meanders,
and led us by such winding Ways, that we were insensibly passed the
Height of the Mountains, without being much incumber'd with the
Snow; and all on a sudden, he showed us the pleasant fruitful Pro-
vinces of Languedoc and Gascoign, all green and flourishing; though
indeed it was at a great Distance, and we had some rough Way to
pass yet
We were a little uneasy however, when we found it snowed one
whole Day, and a Night, so fast, that we could not travel; but hft
bid us be easy, we should soon be past it all: We found indeed, that
we began to descend every Day, and to come more North than
before; and so depending upon our Guide, we went on.
It was about two Hours before Night, when our Guide being some-
*59
thing before us, and not just in Sight, out rushed three monstrous
Wolves, and after them a Bear, out of a hollow Way, adjoining to a
thick Wood; two of the Wolves flew upon the Guide, and had he
Deen half a Mile before us, he had been devour'd indeed, before we
could have helped him: One of them fastened upon his Horse, and
the other attack'd the Man with that Violence, that he had not Time,
or not Presence of Mind enough to draw his Pistol, but hollow'd and
cried out to us most lustily; my Man Friday being next me, I bid
him ride up, and see what was the Matter; as soon as Friday came
in Sight of the Man, he hollow'd as loud as the other, 0 MasterI 0
Master I But like a bold FeUow, rode directly up to the poor Man,
and with his Pistol shot the Wolf that attack'd him into the Head.

It was happy for the poor Man, that it was my Man Friday; for
he having been used to that kind of Creature in his Country, had no
Fear upon him; but went close up to him, and shot him as above;
whereas any of us, would have fired at a farther Distance, and have
perhaps either missed the Wolf, or endanger'd shooting the Man.
But it was enough to have terrify'd a bolder Man than I, and
indeed it alarm'd all our Company, when with the Noise of Friday's
Pistol, we heard on both Sides the dismallest Howling of Wolves,
and the Noise redoubled by the Echo of the Mountains, that it was
to us as if there had been a prodigious Multitude of them; and per-
haps indeed there were not such a Few, as that we had no cause of
Apprehensions.
However, as Friday had killed this Wolf, the other that had
fastened upon the Horse, left him immediately, and fled; having
happily fastened upon his Head, where the Bosses of the Bridle had
stuck in his teeth; so that he had not done him much Hurt: The
Man indeed was most hurt; for the raging Creature had bit him
twice, once on the Arm, and the other Time a little above his Knee;
and he was just as it were tumbling down by the Disorder of his
Horse, when Friday came up and shot the Wolf.
It is easy to suppose, that at the Noise of Friday's Pistol, we all
mended our Pace, and rid up as fast as the Way (which was very
difficult) would give us leave, to see what was the Matter; as soon as
we came clear of the Trees, which blinded us before, we saw clearly
what had been the Case, and how Friday had disengag'd the poor
Guide; though we did not presently discern what kind of Creature it
was he had killed.
But never was a Fight manag'd so hardily, and in such a surprising
Manner, as that which follow'd between Friday and the Bear, which
gave us all (though at first we were surpris'd and afraid for him) the
greatest Diversion imaginable: As the Bear is a heavy, clumsy
Creature, and does not gallop as the Wolf does, who is swift, and
light; so he has two particular Qualities, which generally are the
Rule of his Actions; First, As to Men, who are not his proper Prey;
I say, not his proper Prey; because thqugh I cannot say what ex-
cessive Hunger might do, which was now their Case, the Ground
being all cover'd with Snow; but as to Men, he does not usually
attempt them, unless they first attack him: On the contrary, if you
meet him in the Woods, if you don't meddle with him, he won't
meddle with you; but then you must take Care to be very Civil to
him, and give him the Road; for he is a very nice Gentleman, he
won't go a Step out of his Way for a Prince; nay, if you are really
afraid, your best way is to look another Way, and keep going on; for
sometimes if you stop, and stand still, and look steadily at him, he
takes it for an Affront; but if you throw or toss anything at him, and
it hits him, though it were but a bit of Stick, as big as your Finger, he
takes it for an Affront, and sets all his other Business aside to pursue
his Revenge; for he will have Satisfaction in Point of Honour; that
is his first Quality: The next is, That if he be once affronted, he will
never leave you, Night or Day, till he has his Revenge; but follows
at a good round rale, till he overtakes you.
My Man Friday had delhcr'd our Guide, and when we came ap

to him, he was helping him off from his Horse; for the Man was
Doth hurt and frighted, and indeed, the last more than the first; when
on the sudden, we spied the Bear come out of the Wood, and a vast
monstrous One it was, the biggest by far that ever I saw: We were
all a little surpris'd, when we saw him; but when Friday saw him, it
was easy to see Joy and Courage in the Fellow's Countenance;
O I 01 OI Says Friday, three Times, pointing to him; O Master!
You give me te Leave I Me shakee te Hand with him: Me make you
good laugh.
I was surpris'd to see the Fellow so pleased; You Fool you, says I, he
will eat you up I Eatee me up I Eatee me up I Says Friday, twice over again;
Me eatee him up: Me make you good laugh: You all stay here, me show
you good laugh; so down he sits, and gets his Boots off in a Moment,
and put on a pair of Pumps (as we call the flat Shoes they wear) and
which he had in his Pocket, gives my other Servant his Horse,
and with his Gun away he flew swift like the Wind.
The Bear was walking softly on, and offer'd to meddle with nobody,
till Friday coming pretty near, calls to him, as if the Bear could under-
standhim; Ifarkye,harkye,sa.ysFriday,mespeakee wityou: Wefollow'
d
at a Distance; for now being come down on the Gascoign side of
the Mountains, we were enter'd a vast great Forest, where the Country
was plain, and pretty open, though many Trees in it scatter'd her*
and here.
Friday, who had as we say, the Heels of the Bear, came up with
him quickly, and takes up a great Stone, and throws at him, and hit
him just on the Head; but did him no more harm, than if he had
thrown it against a Wall; but it answer'd Friday's End; for the
Rogue was so void of Fear, that he did it purely to make the Bear
follow him, and show us some Laugh as he called it
As soon as the Bear felt the Stone, and saw him, he turns about,
and comes after him, taking Devilish long Strides, and shuffling
along at a strange Rate, so as would have put a Horse to a middling
Gallop; away runs Friday, and takes his Course, as if he ran
towards us for Help; so we all resolv'd to fire at once upon the Bear,
and deliver my Man; though I was angry at him heartily, for bring-
ing the Bear back upon us, when he was going about his own
Business another Way; and especially I was angry that he had
turned the Bear back upon us, and then run away; and I called out,
You Dog, said I, is this your making us laugh? Come away, and take
your Horse, that we may shoot the Creature; he hears me, and cries
out, No shoot, no shoot, stand still, you get much Laugh. And as the
nimble Creature ran two Foot for the Beast's one, he turned on a
sudden, on one side of us, and seeing a great Oak-Tree, fit for his
Purpose, he beckon'd to us to follow, and doubling his Pace*
he gets nimbly up the Tree, laying his Gun down upon the
Ground, at about five or six Yards from the Bottom of the Tree.
The Bear soon came to the Tree, and we follow'd at a Distance;
the first Thing he did, he stopped at the Gun, smelt to it, but let it lie,
and up he scrambles into the Tree, climbing like a Cat, though so
monstrously heavy: I was amaz'd at the Folly, as I thought it, of my
Man, and could not for my Life see anything to laugh at yet, till see-
ing the Bear get up the Tree, we all rode nearer to him.
When we came to the Tree, there was Friday got out to the small
End of a large Limb of the Tree, and the Bear got about half way to
him; as soon as the Bear got out to that part where the Limb of the
Tree was weaker, Ha, says he to us, noiv you see me teachce the Bear
dance; so he falls a jumping and shaking the Bough, at which the
Bear began to totter, but stood still, and began to look behind him,
to see how he should get back; then indeed we did laugh heartily:
But Friday had not done with him by a great deal; when he sees
him stand still, he calls out to him again, as if he had suppos'd the
Bear could speak English; What, you no come farther, pray you
come farther; so he left jumping and shaking the Tree; and the
Bear, just as if he had understood what he said, did come a little
further, then he fell a jumping again, and the Bear stopped again.
We thought now was a good time to knock him on the Head, and
I call'd to Friday to stand still, and we would shoot the Bear;
but he cried out earnestly, O pray I O pray I No shoot, me shoot, by
and then; he would have said, By and by; However, to shorten the
Story, Friday danced so much, and the Bear stood so ticklish, that
we had laughing enough indeed, but still could not imagine what the
Fellow would do; for first we thought he depended upon shaking the
Bear off; and we found the Bear was too cunning for that too; for
he would not go out far enough to be thrown down, but clings fast
with his great broad Claws and Feet, so that we could not imagine
what would be the End of it, and where the Jest would be at last
But Friday put us out of doubt quickly; for seeing the Bear cling
fast to the Bough, and that he would not be persuaded to come any
farther; Well, well, says Friday, you no come farther, me go, megoj
you no come to me, me go come to you; and upon this, he goes out tc
the smallest End of the Bough, where it would bend with his Weight
and gently lets himself down by it, sliding down the Bough, till he
came near enough to jump down on his Feet, and away he run to his
Gun, takes it up, and stands still.
Well, said I to him, Friday, What will you do now? Why don't
you shoot him? No shoot, says Friday, no yet, me shoot now, me no kill;
me stay, give you one more laugh; and indeed so he did, as you will see
presently; for when the Bear see his Enemy gone, he comes back
from the Bough where he stood; but did it mighty leisurely, looking
behind him every Step, and coming backward till he got into the
Body of the Tree; then with the same hinder End foremost, he came
down the Tree, grasping it with his Claws, and moving one Foot
at a Time, very leisurely; at this Juncture, and just before he could set
his hind Feet upon the Ground, Friday stepped up close to him, clapt
the Muzzle of his Piece into his Ear, and shot him dead as a Stone.
Then the Rogue turned about, to see if we did not laugh, and when
he saw we were pleased by our Looks, he falls a laughing himself
very loud; so we kill Bear in my Country, says Friday; so you kill
them, says I, Why you have no Guns: No, says he, no Gun, but shoot,
great much long Arrow.
This was indeed a good Diversion to us; but we were still in a
wild Place, and our Guide very much hurt, and what to do we hardly
knew; the Howling of Wolves ran much in my Head; and indeed,
except the Noise I once heard on the Shore of Africa, of which I have
said something already, I never heard anything that filled me with so
much Horror.
These things, and the Approach of Night, called us off, or else, as
Friday would have had us, we should certainly have taken the Skin
of this monstrous Creature off, which was worth saving; but we had
three Leagues to go, and our Guide hasten'd us, so we left him, and
went forward on our Journey.
The Ground was still cover'd with Snow, though not so deep and
dangerous as on the Mountains, and the ravenous Creatures, as we heard
afterwards, were come down into the Forest and plain Country, pressed
by Hunger to seek for Food; and had done a great deal of Mischief
in the Villages, where they surpris'd the Country People, killed a grea*
many of their Sheep and Horses, and some People too.
We had one dangerous Place to pass, which our Guide told us, il
there were any more Wolves in the Country, we should find them
there; and this was in a small Plain, surrounded with Woods on
every Side, and a long narrow Defile or Lane, which we were to pass
to get through the Wood, and then we should come to the Village
where we were to lodge.
It was within half an Hour of Sunset when we enter'd the first Wood;
and a little after Sunset when we came into the Plain, we met with
nothing in the first Wood, except, that in a little Plain within the Woe?,
which was not above two Furlongs over, we saw five great Wolves
cross the Road, full Speed one after another, as if they had been in
Chase of some Prey, and had it in View, they took no Notice of us,
and were gone, and out of our Sight in a few Moments.
Upon tSiis jut Guide, who by the Way was a wretched faint-hearted
Fellow, bid us keep in a ready Posture; for he believed there were
more Wolves a coming.
We kept our Arms ready, and our Eyes about us, but we saw no
more Wolves, till we came through that Wood, which was near half a
League, and enter'd the Plain; as soon as we came into the Plain, we had
Occasion enough to look about us : The first Object we met with, was a
dead Horse; that is to say, a poor Horse which the Wolves had killed,
and at least a Dozen of them at Work; we could not say eating of him,
but picking of his Bones rather; for they had eaten up all the Flesh before.
We did not think fit to disturb them at their Feast, neither did they
take much Notice of us: Friday would have let fly at them, but I
would not suffer him by any Means; for I found we were like to have
more Business upon our Hands than we were aware of. We were not
gone half over the Plain, but we began to hear the Wolves howl in the
Wood on our Left, in a frightful Manner, and presently after we saw
about a hundred coming on directly towards us, all in a Body, and
most of them in a Line, as regularly as an Army drawn up by expe-
rienc'd Officers. I scarce knew in what Manner to receive them; but
found to draw ourselves in a close Line was the only Way: so we
formed in a Moment: But that we might not have too much Interval,
I order'd that only every other Man should fire, and that the others who
had not fired should stand ready to give them a second Volley imme-
diately, if they continued to advance upon us, and that then those who
had fired at first, should not pretend to load their Fusees again, but
stand ready with every one a Pistol; for we were all armed with a
Fusee, and a Pair of Pistols each Man; so we were by this Method
able to file six Volleys, half of us at a Time; however, at present we
had no Necessity; for upon firing the first Volley, the Enemy made a
full Stop, being terrify'd as well with the Noise, as with the Fire ; four
of them being shot into the Head, dropped, several others were
wounded, and went bleeding off, as we could see by the Snow: I
found they stopped, but did not immediately retreat; whereupon re-
membering that I had been told, that the fiercest Creatures were
terrify'd at the Voice of a Man, I caused all our Company to hollow
as loud as we could; and I found the Notion not altogether mistaken;
for upon our Shout, they began to retire, and turn about; then I
order'd a second Volley to be fired, in their Rear, which put them to
the Gallop, and away they went to the Woods.
This gave us leisure to charge our Pieces again, and that we might
lose no Time, we kept going; but we had but little more than loaded
our Fusees, and put ourselves into a Readiness, when we heard a
terrible Noise in the same Wood, on our Left, only that it was farther
onward the same Way we were to go.
The Night was coming on, and the Light began to be dusky, which
made it worse on our Side; but the Noise increasing, we could easily
perceive that it was the Howling and Yelling of those hellish Creatures;
and on a sudden, we perceiv'd 2 or 3 Troops of Wolves, one on our
Left, one behind us, and one on our Front; so that we seemed to be
surrounded with them ; however, as they did not fall upon us, we kept
our Way forward, as fast as we could make our Horses go, which the
Way being very rough, was only a good large Trot; and in this
Manner we came in View of the Entrance of a Wood, through which
we were to pass, at the farther Side of the Plain; but we were greatly
surpris'd, when coming nearer the Lane, or Pass, we saw a confus'd
Number of Wolves standing just at the Entrance.
On a sudden, at another opening of the Wood, we heard the Noise of
a Gun; and looking that Way, out rushed a Horse, with a Saddle, and
a Bridle on him, flying like the Wind, and sixteen or seventeen Wolves
after him, full Speed; indeed, the Horse had the Heels of them; but
as we suppos'd that he could not hold it at that rate, we doubted not
but they would get up with him at last, and no question but they did.
But here we had a most horrible Sight; for riding up to the
Entrance where the Horse came out, we found the Carcass of another
Horse, and of two Men, devour'd by the ravenous Creatures, and one
x
ADVENTURES OF
of the Men was no doubt the same who we heard fired the Gun ; foi
there lay a Gun just by him, fired off; but as to the Man, his Head,
and the upper Part of his Body was eaten up.
This filled us with Horror, and we knew not what Course to take,
but the Creatures resolv'd us soon; for they gather'd about us
presently, in hopes of Prey; and I verily believe there were three
hundred of them: It happen'd very much to our Advantage, that at
the Entrance into the Wood, but at a little Way from it, there lay
some large Timber Trees, which had been cut down the Summer
before, and I suppose lay there for Carriage; I drew my little Troop
in among those Trees, and placing ourselves in a Line, behind
.one lone Tree, I advis'd them all to light, and keeping that Tree


before us, for a Breast-Work, to stand in a Triangle, w three Fronts
enclosing our Horses in the Centre.
We did so, and it was well we did; for never was a more furious
Charge than the Creatures made upon us in the Place; they came on
us with a growling kind of a Noise (and mounted the Piece of
Timber,which as I said was our Breast-Work) as if they were only
rushing upon their Prey; and this Fury of theirs, it seems, was princi-
pally occasion'd by their seeing our Horses behind us, which was the
Prey they aimed at: I order'd our Men to fire as before, every other
Man; and they took their Aim so sure, that indeed they killed several
of the Wolves at the first Volley; but there was a Necessity to keep a
continual Firing; for they came on like Devils, those behind pushing
on those before.
When we had fired our second Volley of our Fusees, we thought
they stopped a little, and I hoped they would have gone off; but it
was but a Moment; for others came forward again; so we fired two
Volleys of our Pistols, and I believe in these four Firings, we had
killed seventeen or eighteen of them, and lamed twice as many; yet
they came on again.
I was loth to spend our last Shot too hastily; so I called my
Servant, not my Man Friday, for he was better employ'd; for with
the greatest Dexterity imaginable, he had charged my Fusee, and his
own, while we were engag'd; but as I said, I called my other Man,
and giving him a Horn of Powder, I bade him lay a Train, all along
the Piece of Timber, and let it be a large Train; he did so, and had
but just Time to get away, when the Wolves came up to it, and some
were got up upon it; when I snapping an uncharg'd Pistol, close to
the Powder, set it on fire; those that were upon the Timber were
scorched with it, and six or seven of them fell, or rather jumped in
among us, with the Force and Fright of the Fire, we dispatch'd these
in an Instant, and the rest were so frighted with the Light, which the
Night, for it was now very near Dark, made more terrible, that they
drew back a little.
Upon which I order'd our last Pistol to be fired off in one Volley,
and after that we gave a Shout; upon this, the Wolves turned Tail,,
and we sally'd immediately upon near twenty lame Ones, who we
found struggling on the Ground, and fell a cutting them with our
Swords, which answer'd our Expectation; for the Crying and How-
ling they made, was better understood by their Fellows, so that they
all fled and left us.
We had, first and last, killed about three Score of them; and had
•t been Daylight, we had killed many more: The Field of Battle
being thus cleared, we made forward again; for we had still near a
League to go. We heard the ravenous Creatures howl and yell in
the Woods as we went, several Times; and sometimes we fancy'd we
saw some of them, but the Snow dazzling our Eyes, we were not
certain; so in about an Hour more, we came to the Town, where we
were to lodge, which we found in a terrible Fright, and all in Arms;
for it seems, that the Night before, the Wolves and some Bears had
broke into the Village in the Night, and put them in a terrible Frigh^
and they were oblig'd to keep Guard Night and Day, but especially
tp the Night, to preserve their Cattle, and indeed their People.
The next Morning our Guide was so ill, and his Limbs swelled
with the rankling of his two Wounds, that he could go no farther; so
we were oblig'd to take a new Guide there, and go to Thoulouse, where
we found a warm Climate, a fruitful pleasant Country, and no Snow,
no Wolves, or anything like them; but when we told our Story at
Thoulouse, they told us it was nothing but what was ordinary in the
great Forest at the Foot of the Mountains, especially when the Snow
lay on the Ground: But they inquir'd much what kind of a Guide
we had gotten, that would venture to bring us that Way in such a
severe Season; and told us, it was very much we were not all de-
vour'd. . When we told them how we placed ourselves, and the
Horses in the Middle, they blamed us exceedingly, and told us it was
fifty to one but we had been all destroy'd; for it was the Sight of the
Horses which made the Wolves so furious, seeing their Prey; and
that at other Times they are really afraid of a Gun; but they being ex-
cessive Hungry, and raging on that Account, the Eagerness to come
at the Horses had made them senseless of Danger; and that if we
had not by the continu'd Fire, and at last by the Stratagem of the
Train of Powder, master'd them, it had been great Odds but that we
had been torn to Pieces; whereas had we been content to have sat
still on Horseback, and fired as Horsemen, they would not have
taken the Horses for so much their own, when Men were on theii
Backs, as otherwise; and withal they told us, that at last, if we had
stood altogether, and left our Horses, they would have been so
eager to have devour'd them, that we might have come off safe,
especially having our Fire Arms in our Hands, and being so many
in Number.
For my Part, I was never so sensible of Danger in my Life; for
seeing above three hundred Devils come roaring and opened mouthed
to devour us, and having nothing to shelter us, or retreat to, I gave
myself over for lost; and as it was, I believe, I shall never care to cross
those Mountains again; I think I would much rather go a thousand
Leagues by Sea, though I were sure to meet with a Storm once a Week.
I have nothing uncommon to take Notice of, in my Passage
through France; nothing but what other Travellers have given an
Account of, with much more Advantage than I can. I travell'd from
Thoulouse to Paris, and without any considerable Stay, came to Ca-
lais, and landed safe at Dover, the fourteenth ot January, after having
bad a severely cold Season to travel in.
I was now come to the Centre of ray Travels, and had in a little
Time all my new discover'd Estate safe about me, the Bills of Ex-
change which I brought with me having been very currently paid.
My principal Guide, and Privy Counsellor, was my good ancient
Widow, who in Gratitude for the Money I had sent her, thought no
Tains too much, or Care too great, to employ for me; and I trusted
her so entirely with everything, that I was perfectly easy as to the
Security of my Effects; and indeed, I was very happy from my
Beginning, and now to the End, in the unspotted Integrity of this
good Gentlewoman.
And now I began to think of leaving my Effects with this Woman,
and setting out for Lisbon, and so to the Brasils; but now another
Scruple came in my Way, and that was Religion; for as I had en-
tertain'd some Doubts about the Roman Religion, even while I was
abroad, especially in my State of Solitude; so I knew there was no
going to the Brasils for me, much less going to settle there, unless I
resoh/d to embrace the Roman Catholic Religion, without any
Reserve; unless on the other hand, I resolv'd to be a Sacrifice to my
Principles, be a Martyr for Religion, and die in the Inquisition; so
I resolv'd to stay at Home, and if I could find Means for it, to
dispose of my Plantation.
To this Purpose I wrote to my old Friend at Lisbon, who in
Return gave me Notice, that he could easily dispose of it there: But
that if I thought fit to give him Leave to offer it in my Name to the
two Merchants, the Survivors of my Trustees, who lived in the
Brasils, who must fully understand the Value of it, who lived just
upon the Spot, and who I knew were very rich; so that he believ'd
they would be fond of buying it; he did not doubt, but I should
make 4 or 5000 Pieces of Eight, the more of it
Accordingly I agreed, gave him Order to offer it to them, and he
did so; and in about 8 Months more, the Ship being then return'd,
he sent me an Account, that they had accepted the Offer, and had
remitted 33,000 Pieces of Eight, to a Correspondent of theirs at
Lisbon, to pay for it
In Return, I signed the Instrument of Sale in the Form which
they sent from Lisbon, and sent it to my old Man, who sent me Bills
of Exchange for 32,800 Pieces of Eight to me, for the Estate; re-
serving the Payment of too Moidores a Year to him, the old Man,
during his Life, and 50 Moidores afterwards to his Son for his Life,
which I had promised them, which the Plantation was to make good
as a Rentcharge. And thus I have given the first Part of a Life of
Fortune and Adventure, a Life of Providence's Chequer-work, and
of a Variety which the World will seldom be able to show the like of:
Beginning foolishly, but closing much more happily than any Part of
it ever gave me Leave so much as to hope for.
Any one would think, that in this State of complicated good
Fortune, I was past running any more Hazards; and so indeed I
had been, if other Circumstances had concurr'd, but I was inur'd tn
a wandering Life, had no Family, not many Relations, nor however
rich had I contracted much Acquaintance; and though I had sold
my Estate iivthe Brasils, yet I could not keep the Country out of my
Head, and had a great Mind to be upon the Wing again, especially
I could not resist the strong Inclination I had to see my Island, and
to know if the poor Spaniards were in Being there, and how the
Rogues I left there had used them.
My true Friend, the Widow, earnestly dissuaded me from it, and
so far prevail'd with me, that for almost seven Years she prevented
my running Abroad; during which time, I took my two Nephews, the
Children of one of my Brothers, into my Care: The eldest having
something of his own, I bred up as a Gentleman, and gave him a
Settlement of some Addition to his Estate, after my Decease; the
other I put out to a Captain of a Ship; and after five Years, finding
him a sensible bold enterprising young Fellow, I put him into a good
Ship, and sent him to Sea: And this young Fellow afterwards drew
me in, as old as I was, to farther Adventures myself.
In the meantime, I in Part settled myself here; for first of all I
marry'd, and that not either to my Disadvantage or Dissatisfaction,
and had three Children, two Sons and one Daughter: But my Wife
dying, and my Nephew coming Home with good Success from a
Voyage to Spain, my Inclination to go Abroad, and his Importunity
prevailed and engag'd me to go in his Ship, as a private Trader to
the East Indies: This was in the Year 1694.
In this Voyage I visited my new Colony in the Island, saw my
Successors the Spaniards, had the whole Story of their Lives, and of
the Villains I left there; how at first they insulted the poor Spaniards,
how they afterwards agreed, disagreed, united, separated, and how at
last the Spaniards were oblig'd to use Violence with them, how they
were subjected to the Spaniards, how honestly the Spaniards used
them; a History, if it were enter'd into, as full of Variety and won-
derful Accidents, as my own Part, particularly also as to their Battles
with the Caribbeans, who landed several times upon the Island, and
as to the Improvements they made upon the Island itself, and how
five of them made an Attempt upon the main Land, and brought
away eleven Men and five Women Prisoners, by which at my coming,
I found about twenty young Children on the Island.
.Here I stayed about 20 Days, left them Supplies of all neces-
sary things, and particularly of Arms, Powder, Shot, Clothes, Tools,
and two Workmen, which I brought from England with me, viz. a
Carpenter and a Smith.
Besides this, I shared the Island into Parts with them, and reserv'd
to myself the Property of the whole, but gave them such Parts res-
pectively as they agreed on; and having settled all things with them,
and engaged them not to leave the Place, I left them there.
From thence I touched at the Brasils, from whence I sent a Bark,
which I bought there, with more People to the Island, and in it, be-
sides other Supplies, I sent seven Women, being such as I found
proper for Service, or for Wives to such as would take them: As to
the English Men, I promis'd them to send them some Women from
England, with a good Cargo of Necessaries, if they would apply them-
selves to Planting, which I afterwards perform'd. And the Fellows
proved very honest and diligent after they were master'd, and had
their Properties set apart for them. I sent them also from the
Brasils five Cows, three of them being big with Calf, some
Sheep, and some Hogs, which, when I came again, were considerably
increas'd.
But all these things, with an Account how 300 Caribbea.
came and invaded them, and ruin'd their Plantations, and how they
fought with that whole Number twice, and were at first defeated, and
three of them killed; but at last a Storm destroying their Enemies'
Canoes, they famish'd or destroy'd almost all the rest, and renew'd
and recover'd the Possession of their Plantation, and still lived upon
the Island.
All these things, with some very surprising Incidents in some new
Adventures of my own, for ten Years more, I may perhaps give $
Carther Account of hereafter.

THE PREFACE.

HE Stucen t/.c fo/mer Part of this Work has
met with in the World, has yet been no other
than is acknowledg'd to be due to the surprising
Variety of the Subject, and to the agreeable
Manner of the Performance.
All the Endeavours of envious People to re-
proach it with being a Romance, to search it for Errors in Geography,
Inconsistency in the Relation, and Contradictions in the Fact, have proved
abortive, and as impotent as malicious.
The just Application of every Incident, the religious and useful In-
ferences drawn from every Part, are so many Testimonies to the good
Design of making it public, and must legitimate all the Part that may
if called Invention, or Parable in the Story.
The Second Part, if the Editor's Opinion may pass, is (contrary <c
the Usage of Second Parts,) every Hay as entertaining as the First,
contains as strange and surprising Incidents, and as great a Variety of
them; nor is the Application less serious, or suitable; and doubtless 'will,
to the sober, as well as ingenious Reader, be every way as profitable and
diverting; and this makes the abridging this Work, as scandalous, as it
is knavish and ridiculous; seeing, while to shorten the Book. that they
may seem to reduce the Value, they strip it cf all those Reflections, as
well religious as moral, which are not only the greatest Beauties of the
Work, but are calculated for the infinite Advantage of the Header.
By this they leave the Work naked of its brightest Ornaments; and
if they would, at the same Time pretend, that the Author has supply'd
the Story out of his Invention, they take from it the Improvement, which
alone recommends that Invention to wise and good Men.
The Injury these Men do the Proprietor of this Work, is a Practice
all honest Men abhor; and he believes he may challenge them to shew the
Difference between that and Robbing on the H'ghway, or Breaking open
a House.
If they can't shew any Difference in the Crime, they will find it hard
to shew why there should be any Difference in the Punishment: And
he will answer for it, that nothing shall be wanting on his Part, to do
them justice.

THE
FARTHER ADVENTURES
OF
ROBINSON CRUSOE, t*.

HAT homely Proverb used on so many Occasions
in England, viz. That what is bred in the Bone will
not go out of the Flesh, was never more verify'd,
than in the Story of my Life. Any one would
think, that after thirty-five Years' Affliction, and
a Variety of unhappy Circumstances, which few
Men, if any ever, went through before, and after
near seven Years of Peace and Enjoyment in the Fulness of all
Things; grown old, and when, if ever, it might be allowed me to
have had experience of every State of middle Life, and to know which
was most adapted to make a Man completely happy: I say, after all
this, any one would have thought that the native Propensity to
rambling, which I gave an Account of in my first Setting out into the
World, to have been so predominate in my Thoughts, should be worn
out, the volatile Part be fully evacuated, or at least condens'd, and I
might at 61 Years of Age have been a little inclin'd to stay at Home,
and have done venturing Life and Fortune any more-
Nay farther, the common Motive of foreign Adventures was taken
away in me; for I had no Fortune to make, I had nothing to seek:
If I had gained ten thousand Pound, I had been no richer; for I had
already sufficient for me, and for those I had to leave it to; and that
I had was visibly increasing; for having no great Family, I could not
spend the Income of what I had, unless I would set up for an expen-
sive Way of Living, such as a great Family, Servants, Equipage,
Gaiety, and the like, which were Things I had no Notion of, or In-
clination to; so that I had nothing indeed to do, but to sit still,
and fully erjoy what I had got, and see it increase daily upon my
Hands.
Yet all these Things had no Effect upon me, or at least, not
enough to resist the strong Inclination I had to go Abroad again,
which hung about me like a chronical Distemper; particularly the
Desire of seeing my new Plantation in the Island, and the Colony
I left there, run in my Head continually. I dreamed of it all
Night, and my Imagination run upon it all Day; it was uppermost
in all my Thoughts, and my Fancy worked so steadily and strongly
upon it, that I talked of it out of Sleep; in short, nothing could
remove it out of my Mind; it even broke so violently into all my
Discourses, that it made my Conversation tiresome; for I could
talk of nothing else, all my Discourse run into it, even to Imper-
tinence, and I saw it myself.
I have often heard Persons of good Judgment say, That all
the Stir People make in the World about Ghosts and Apparitions,
is owing to the Strength of Imagination, and the powerful Opera-
tion of Fancy in their Minds; that there is no such Thing as &
Spirit appearing, or a Ghost walking, and the like: That People's
poring affectionately upon the past Conversation of their deceas'd
Friends, so realizes it to them, that they are capable of fancying upon
some extraordinary Circumstances, that they see them; talk to them,
and are answered by them, when, in Truth, there is nothing but
Shadow and Vapour in the Thing; and they really know nothing of
the Matter.
For my Part, I know not to this Hour, whether there are any such
Things as real Apparitions, Spectres, or walking of People after the)
are dead, or whether there is anything in the Stories they tell us of
that Kind, more than the Product of Vapours, sick Minds, and wan-
dering Fancies; But this I know, that my Imagination worked up to
such a Height, and brought me into such Ecstasies of Vapours, or
what else I may call it, that I actually suppos'd myself, often-times
upon the Spot, at my old Castle behind the Trees; saw my old
Spaniard, Friday's Father, and the reprobate Sailors I left upon the
Island; nay, I fancy'd I talked with them, and looked at them so
steadily, though I was broad awake, as at Persons just before me;
and this I did till I often frighted myself with the Images my Fancy
represented to me: One Time in my Sleep I had the Villany of the
3 Pirate Sailors so lively related to me by the first Spaniard and
Friday's Father, that it was surprising; they told me how they bar-
barously attempted to murder all the Spaniards, and that they set Fire
to the Provisions they had laid up, on Purpose to distress and starve
them, Things that I had never heard of, and that indeed were never
all of them true in Fact: But it was so warm in my Imagination,
and so realiz'd to me, that to the Hour I saw them, I could not be
persuaded, but that it was or would be true; also how I resented
it, when the Spaniard complain'd to me, and how I brought them to
Justice, tried them before me, and order'd them all three to be hanged:
What there was really in this, shall be seen in its Place: For how-
ever I came to form such Things in my Dream, and what secret
Converse of Spirits injected it, yet there was very much of it true. I
say, I own that this Dream had nothing in it literally and specifi.
cally true: But the general Part was so true, the base villanous
Behaviour of these three harden'd Rogues was such, and had been so
much worse than all I can describe, that the Dream had too much
Similitude of the Fact, and as I would afterwards have punished
them severely ; so if I had hanged them all, I had been much in the
Right, and should have been justifiable both by the Laws of God
and Man.
But to return to my Story; in this Kind of Temper I had lived
some Years, I had no Enjoyment of my Life, no pleasant Hours, no
agreeable Diversion but what had something or other of this in it;
so that my Wife, who saw my Mind so wholly bent upon it, told me
very seriously one Night, That she believ'd there was some secret
powerful Impulse of Providence upon me, which had determin'd me
to go thither again; and that she found nothing hindered my going,
but my being engag'd to a Wife and Children. She told me that i:
was true she could not think of parting with me; but as she was
assur'd, that if she was dead, it would be the first Thing I would do:
So as it seemed to her, that the Thing was determin'd above, she
would not be the only Obstruction: for if I thought fit, and resolv'd
to go here she found me very intent upon her Words, and that I
looked very earnestly at her; so that it a little disorder'd her, and
she stopped. I asked her, Why she did not go on, and say out what
she was going to say? But I perceiv'd her Heart was too full, and
some Tears stood in her Eyes: Speak out, my Dear, said I. Are you
willing I should go? No, says she very affectionately, I am far from
willing: But if you are resolv'd to go, says she, and rather than I will
be the only Hindrance, I will go with you; for though I think it a
most preposterous Thing for one of your Years, and in your Condi-
tion, yet if it must be, said she, again weeping, I won't leave you; for
if it be of Heaven, you must do it There is no resisting it; and if
Heaven makes it your Duty to go, he will also make it mine to go
with you, or otherwise dispose of me, that I may not obstruct it
This affectionate Behaviour of my Wife's brought me a little out of
the Vapours, and I began to consider what I was a doing; I corrected
my wandering Fancy, and began to argue with myself sedately, what
Business I had after threescore Years, and after such a Life of
tedious Sufferings and Disasters, and closed in so happy and easy a
Manner, I say, what Business I had to rush into new Hazards, and
put myself upon Adventures, fit only for Youth and Poverty to run into.
With those Thoughts, I considered my new Engagement, that I
had a Wife, one Child born, and my Wife then great with Child of
another; that I had all the World could give me, and had no Need
to seek Hazards for Gain ; that I was declining in Years, and ought to
think rather of leaving what I had gained, than of seeking to increase
it; that as to what my Wife had said, of its being an Impulse from
Heaven, and that it should be my Duty to go, I had no Notion of
that; so after many of these Cogitations, I struggled with the Power
of my Imagination, reason'd myself out of it, as I believe People may
always do in like Cases, if they will; and, in a Word, I conquer'd it;
compos'd myself with such Arguments as occurr'd to my Thought,
and which my present Condition furnish'd me plentifully with, and
particularly, as the most effectual Method, I resolv'd to divert myself
with other Things, and to engage in some Business that might effec-
tually tie me up from any more Excursions of this Kind; for I found
that Thing return upon me chiefly when I was idle, had nothing to
do, or anything of Moment immediately before me.
To this Purpose I bought a little Farm in the County of Bedford,
and resolv'd to remove myself thither. I had a little convenient
House upon it, and the Land about it I found was capable of
great Improvement, and that it was many Ways suited to my Incli-
nation, which delighted in Cultivating, Managing, Planting, and Im-
proving of Land; and particularly, being an Inland Country, I was
remov'd from conversing among Ships, Sailors, and Things relating
to the remote Part of the World.
In a Word, I went down to my Farm, settled my Family, bought
me Ploughs, Harrows, a Cart, Waggon, Horses, Cows, Sheep; and
setting seriously to Work, became in one half Year, a mere Country
Gentleman; my Thoughts were entirely taken up in managing my
Servants, cultivating the Ground, Enclosing, Planting, cVv. and I
lived, as I thought, the most agreeable Life that Nature was capable
of directing, or that a Man always bred to Misfortunes was capable of
being retreated to.
I farmed upon my own Land, I had no Rent to pay, was limited
by no Articles; I could pull up or cut down as I pleased: What I
planted, was for myself, and what I improved, was for my Family;
and having thus left off the Thoughts of Wandering, I had not the
least Discomfort in any Part of Life, as to this World. Now I
thought indeed, that I enjoy'd the middle State of Life, that my
Father so earnestly recommended to me, and lived a kind of heavenly
Life, something like what is described by the Poet upon the Subject
of a Country Life.
Free from Pices, free from Care,
Age has no Pain, and Youth no Snare.
But in the Middle of all this Felicity, one Blow from unforeseen
Providence unhing'd me at once; and not only made a Breach upon
me inevitable and incurable, but drove me, by its Consequences, into
a deep Relapse into the wandering Disposition, which, as I may say,
being born in my very Blood, soon recover'd its hold of me, and like
the Returns of a violent Distemper, came on with an irresistible Force
upon me; so that nothing could make any more Impression upon me.
This Blow was the Loss of my Wife.
It is not my Business here to write an Elegy upon my Wife, give a
Character of her particular Virtues, and make my Court to the Sex
by the Flattery of a Funeral Sermon. She was, in a few Words, the
Y
Stay of all my Affairs, the Centre of all my Enterprises, the Engine,
that by her Prudence reduc'd me to that happy Compass I was in,
from the most extravagant and ruinous Project that flutter'd in my
Head, as above; and did more to guide my rambling Genius, than a
Mother's Tears, a Father's Instructions, a Friend's Counsel, or all my
own reasoning Powers could do. I was happy in listening to her
Tears, and in being moved by her Entreaties, and to the last Degree
desolate and dislocated in the World by the Loss of her.
When she was gone, the World looked awkwardly round me; I
was as much a Stranger in it, in my Thoughts, as I was in the Brasils,
when I went first on Shore there; and as much alone, except as
to the Assistance of Servants, as I was in my Island. I knew neither
what to do, or what not to do. I saw the World busy round me, one
Part labouring for Bread, and the other Part squandering in vile Ex-
cesses or empty Pleasures, equally miserable, because the End they
propos'd still fled from them; for the Man of Pleasure every Day
surfeited of his Vice, and heaped up Work for Sorrow and Repentance;
and the Men of Labour spent their Strength in daily Strugglings for
Bread to maintain the vital Strength they labour'd with, so living in
a daily Circulation of Sorrow, living but to work, and working but to
live, as if daily Bread were the only End of wearisome Life, and a
wearisome Life the only Occasion of daily Bread.
This put me in Mind of the Life, I lived in my Kingdom, the
Island; where I suffer'd no more Cor n to grow, because I did not
want it; and bred no more Goats, because I had no more Use forthem:
Where the Money lay in the Drawer till it grew mouldy, and had
scarce the Favour to be looked upon in 2o Years.
All these Things, had I improv'd them as I ought to have done,
and as Reason and Religion had dictated to me, would have taught
to me to search farther than human Enjoyments for a full Felicity,
and that there was something which certainly was the Reason and End
of Life, superior to all these Things, and which was either to be pos-
sess'd, or at least hoped for on this Side the Grave.
But my Sage Counsellor was gone, I was like a Ship without a
Pilot, that could only run afore the Wind: My Thoughts ran all
away again into the old Affair, my Head quite was turned with the
Whimsies of foreign Adventures, and all the pleasant innocent
Amusements of my Farm, and my Garden, my Cattle, and rny
Family, which before entirely possess'd me, were nothing to me, had
no Relish, and were like Music to one that has no Ear, or Food to
one that has no Taste: In a Word, I resolv'd to leave off House-
keeping, let my Farm, and return to London; and in a few Months
after, I did so.
When I came to London, I was still as uneasy as I was before, I
had no Relish to the Place, no Employment in it, nothing to do but
to saunter about like an idle Person, of whom it may be said, he is
perfectly useless in God's Creation; and it is not one Farthing Mat-
ter to the rest of his Kind, whether he be dead or alive. This also
was the Life, which of all Circumstances of Life was the most my
Aversion, who had been all my Days used to an active Life; and I
would often say to myself, A State of Idleness is the very Dregs of Life;
and indeed I thought I was much more suitably employ'd, when I
was 26 Days making me a Deal Board.
It was now the Beginning of the Year 1693, when my Nephew,
whom as I had observ'd before I had brought up to the Sea, and had
made him Commander of a Ship, was come Home from a short
Voyage to BUboa, being the first he had made; and he came to me
and told me, that some Merchants of his Acquaintance had been pro-
posing to him to go a Voyage for them to the East Indies and to
China, as private Traders: And now Uncle, says he, if you will go to
Sea with me, I'll engage toland you upon your old Habitation in the
Island, for we are to touch at the Brasils.
Nothing can be a greater Demonstration of a future State, and of
the Existence of an invisible World, than the Concurrence of second
Causes, with the Ideas of Things, which we form in our Minds, per-
fectly reserv'd, and not communicated to any in the World.
My Nephew knew nothing how far my Distemper of wandering was
return'd upon me, and I knew nothing of what he had in his Thoughts
to say, when that very Morning before he came to me, I had a great
deal of Confusion of Thought, and revolving every Part of my Cir-
cumstances in my Mind, came to this Resolution, viz. That I would
go to Lisbon, and consult with my old Sea-Captain; and so if it was
rational and practicable, I would go and see the Island again, and
see what was become of my People there. I had pleased myself
with the Thoughts of peopling the Place, and carrying Inhabitants
from hence, getting a Patent for the Possession, and I know not what;
when in the Middle of all this, in comes my Nephew, as I have said,
with his Project of carrying me thither, in his Way to the East-Indies,
I paused a while at his Words, and looking steadily at him, What
Devil, said I, sent you of this unlucky Errand? My Nephew startled
as if he had been frighted at first; but perceiving I was not much
displeas'd with the Proposal, he recover'd himself. I hope it may
not be an unlucky Proposal, Sir, says he, I daresay you would be
pleased to see your new Colony there, where you once reigned
with more Felicity, than most of your Brother Monarchs in the World.
In a Word, the Scheme hit so exactly with my Temper, that is to
say, the Prepossession I was under, and of which I have said so
much, that I told him in few Words, if he agreed with the Mer-
chants, I would go with him: But I told him, I would not promise
to go any farther than my own Island. Why Sir, says he, you don't
want to be left there again, I hope? Why, said I, can you not take
me up again in your Return? He told me, it could not be possible,
that the Merchants would allow him to come that Way with a loaded
Ship of such value, it being a Month's Sail out of his Way, and
might be three or four: Besides, Sir, if I should miscarry, said he,
and not return at all, then you would be just reduced to the Con-
dition you were in before.
This was very rational; but we both found out a Remedy for it,
which was to carry a framed Sloop on board the Ship, which being taken
in Pieces, and shipped on board the Ship, might by the Help of some
Carpenters, whom we agreed to carry with us, be set up again in the
Island, and finish'd, fit to go to Sea in a few Days.
I was not long resolving; for indeed the Importunities of my
Nephew joined in so effectually with my Inclination, that nothing
could oppose me: On the other Hand, my Wife being dead, I had
nobody concern'd themselves so much for me, as to persuade me one
way or other, except my ancient good Friend the Widow, who
earnestly struggled with me to consider my Years, my easy Circum-
stances, and the needless Hazards of a long Voyage; and above all,
my young Children: But it was all to no Purpose, I had an irresis-
tible Desire to the Voyage; and I told her, I thought there was some-
thing so uncommon in the Impressions I had upon my Mind for the
Voyage, that it would be a kind of resisting Providence, if I should
attempt to stay at Home; after which, she ceased her Expostulations,
and joined with me, not only in making Provision for my Voyage,
but also in settling my Family Affairs for my Absence, and pro-
viding for the Education of my Children.
In Order to this, I made my Will, and settled the Estate I had, in
rach a Manner for my Children, and placed in such Hands, that I
was perfectly easy and satisfy'd they would have Justice done'them,
whatever might befal me; and for their Education, I left it wholly to
my Widow, with a sufficient Maintenance to herself for her Care:
All which she richly deserv'd; for no Mother could have taken more
Care in their Education, or understood it better; and as she lived
till I came Home, I also lived to thank her for it
My Nephew was ready to sail about the Beginning of January
1694-5, and I with my Man Friday went on board in the Downs the
8th, having besides that Sloop which I mention'd above, a very consider-
able Cargo of all Kinds of necessary Things for my Colony, which if
I did not find in good Condition, I resolv'd to leave so.
First, I carry'd with me some Servants, whom I purposed to place
there, as Inhabitants, or at least to set on Work there upon my own
Account while I stayed, and either to leave them there, or carry
them forward as they should appear willing; particularly, I carry'd
two Carpenters, a Smith, and a very handy ingenious Fellow, who was a
Cooper by Trade but was also a general Mechanic; for he was
dexterous at making Wheels, and Hand-Mills to grind Corn, was a
good Turner, and a good Pot-Maker; he also made anything that
was proper to make of Earth, or of Wood; in a Word, we called him
Our Jack of all Trades.
With these I carry'd a Tailor, who had offer'd himself to go Pas-
senger to the East Indies with my Nephew, but afterwards consented
to stay on our New Plantation, and proved a most necessary handy
Fellow, as could be desir'd, in many other Businesses, besides that ol
his Trade; for as I observ'd formerly, Necessity arms us for all Em-
ployments.
My Cargo, as near as I can collect, for I have not kept an Account
of the Particulars, consisted of a sufficient Quantity of Linen, and
some thin English Stuffs for clothing the Spaniards that I expected
to find there, and enough of them, as by my Calculation might com-
fortably supply them for seven Years; If I remember right, the
Materials I carried for clothing them with, Gloves, Hats, Shoes,
Stockings, and all such Things as they could want for wearing,
amounted to above 200 Pounds, including some Beds, Bedding, and
Household Stuff, particularly Kitchen Utensils, with Pots, Kettles,
Pewter, Brass, 6v. and near a hundred Pound more in Ironwork,
Nails, Tools of every Kind, Staples, Hooks, Hinges, and every neces-
sary Thing I could think of.
I carry'd also an hundred spare Arms, Muskets, and Fuzees, besides
some Pistols, a considerable Quantity of Shot of all Sizes, and two
Pieces of Brass Cannon; and because I knew not what Time, and
what Extremities I was providing for, I carry'd an hundred Barrels
of Powder, besides Swords, Cutlasses, and the Iron Part of some
Pikes, and Halberts; so that in short we had a large Magazine of all
Sorts of Stores; and I made my Nephew carry two small Quarter-
Deck Guns more than he wanted for his Ship, to leave behind, if
there was Occasion; that when we came there, we might build a Fort,
and man it against all Sorts of Enemies: And indeed, I at first thought
there was Need enough for it all, and much more, if we hoped to
maintain our Possession of the Island, as shall be seen in the Course
of that Story.
I had not such bad Luck in this Voyage as I had been used to
meet with; and therefore shall have the less Occasion to interrupt
the Reader, who perhaps may be impatient to hear how Matters went
with my Colony; yet some odd Accidents, cross Winds, and bad
Weather happen'd, on this first setting out, which made the Voyage
longer than I expected it at first; and I who had never made but one
Voyage, (viz.) my first Voyage to Guinea, in which I might be said \f\
come back again, as the Voyage was at first design'd, began to think
the same ill Fate still attended me; and that I was born to be never
contented with being on Shore, and yet to be always unfortunate at Sea.
Contrary Winds first put us to the Northward, and we were oblig'd
to put in at Galway in Ireland, where we lay Wind-bound two-and-
twenty Days; but we had this Satisfaction with the Disaster, that
Provisions were here exceeding cheap, and in the utmost Plenty; so
that while we lay here, never touch'd the Ship's Stores, but rather
added to them; here also I took in several live Hogs, and two Cows, and
Calves, which I resolv'd, if I had a good Passage, to put on Shore in
my Island, but we found Occasion to dispose otherwise of them.
We set out the 5th of February from Ireland and had a very fair
Gale of Wind for some Days; as I remember, it might be about the
aoth of February in the Evening late, when the Mate having the
Watch, came into the Round-house, and told us, he saw a Flash of
Fire, and heard a Gun fired, and while he was telling us of it, a Boy
came in, and told us the Boatswain heard another. This made us all
1 an out upon the Quarter-Deck, where for a while we heard nothing,
but in a few Minutes we saw a very great Light, and found that there
was some very terrible Fire at a Distance; immediately we had
Recourse to our Reckonings, in which we all agreed, that there could
be no Land that Way, in which the Fire shewed itself, no not for 500
Leagues, for it appear'd at W.N.W. Upon this we concluded it
must be some Ship on Fire at Sea; and as by our hearing the Noise
of Guns just before, we concluded it could not be far off: We stood
directly towards it, and were presently satisfy'd we should discover it,
because the farther we sailed, the greater the Light appear'd, though
the Weather being hazy, we could not perceive anything but the
Light for a while; in about half an Hour's Sailing, the Wind being
fair for us, though not much of it, and the Weather clearing up a little,
we could plainly discern that it was a great Ship on Fire in the Middle
of the Sea.
I was most sensibly touched with this Disaster, though not at all
acquainted with the Persons engag'd in it; I presently recollected
my former Circumstances, and in what Condition I was in, when taken
up by the Portugal Captain; and how much more deplorable the
Circumstances of the poor Creatures belonging to this Ship must be,
if they had no other Ship in Company with them: Upon this, I im-
mediately order^, that five Guns should be fired, one soon after
another, that, if possible, we might give Notice to them, that there
was Help for them at hand, and that they might endeavour to save
themselves in their Boat; for though we could see the Flame of the
Ship, yet they, it being Night, could see nothing of us.
We lay by some Time upon this, only driving as the burning Ship
drove, waiting for Daylight; when, on a sudden, to our great Terror,
though we had Reason to expect it, the Ship blew up in the Air; and
immediately, that is to say, in a few Minutes, all the Fire was out,
that is to say, the rest of the Ship sunk: This was a terrible, and
indeed an afflicting Sight, for the Sake of the poor Men, who, I con-
cluded, must be either all destroy'd in the Ship, or be in the utmost
Distress in their Boat in the Middle of the Ocean, which at present,
by Reason it was dark, I could not see: However, to direct them as
well as I could, I caused Lights to be hung out in all the Parts of the
Ship where we could, and which we had Lanterns for, and kept firing
Guns all the Night long, letting them know by this, that there was a
Snip not far off.
About 8 o'Clock in the Morning we discover'd the Ship's Boats by
the Help of our Perspective Glasses, and found thsre were two of
them, both thronged with People, and deep in the Water: We per-
ceiv'd they rowed, the Wind being against them, that they saw our
Ship, and did their utmost to make us see them.
We immediately spread our Ancient to let them know we saw them,
and hung a Waft out as a Signal for them to come on Board, and then
made more Sail, standing directly to them. In little more than half
an Hour we came up with them, and, in a word, took them all in,
being no less than sixty-four Men, Women, and Children; for there
were a great many Passengers.
Upon the whole, we found it was a French Merchant Ship of 300
Ton, homeward bound from Quebec, in the River of Canada. The
Master gave us a long Account of the Distress of his Ship, how the
Fire began in the Steerage by the Negligence of the Steersman; but
on his crying out for Help, was, as everybody thought, entirely put
out, when they found that some Sparks of the first Fire had gotten
into some Part of the Ship, so difficult to come at, that they could
not effectually quench it, till getting in between the Timbers, and
within the Ceiling of the Ship, it proceeded into the Hold, and
master'd all the Skill, and all the Application they were able to
exert
They had no more to do then, but to get into their Boats, which to
their great Comfort were pretty large, being their Longboat, and a
great Shallop, besides a small Skiff which was of no great Service to
them, other than to get some fresh Water and Provisions into her,
after they had secur'd their Lives from the Fire. They had indeed
tmall Hope of their Lives by getting into these Boats at that Distance
from any Land, only as they said well, that they were escap'd from
the Fire, and had a Possibility that some Ship might happen to be at
Sea, and might take them in. They had Sails, Oars, and a Compass,
and were preparing to make the best of their Way back to Newfound-
land, the Wind blowing pretty fair, for it blew an easy Gale at S.E.
by E. They had as much Provisions and Water, as with sparing it
so as to be next door to starving, might support them about 11 Days;
in which, if they had no bad Weather, and no contrary Winds, the
Captain said, he hoped he might get the Banks of Newfoundland, and
might perhaps take some Fish to sustain them till they might go on
Shore. But there were so many Chances against diem in all these
Cases; such as, Storms to overset and founder them, Rains and Cold
to benumb and perish their Limbs, contrary Winds to keep them out
and starve them, that it must have been next to miraculous if they
had escap'd.
In the midst of their Consultations, every one being hopeless, and
ready to despair, the Captain with Tears in his Eyes told me, they
were on a sudden surpris'd with the Joy of hearing a Gun fire, and
after that four more; these were the five Guns which I caused to be
fired at first seeing the Light: This reviv'd their Hearts, and gave
them the Notice, which, as above, I desir'd it should, (viz.) that there
was a Ship at hand for their Help.
It was upon the hearing these Guns, that they took down their Masts
and Sails; the Sound coming from the Windward, they resolv'd to lie
by till Morning. Some Time after this, hearing no more Guns, they
fired three Muskets, one a considerable While after another; but
these, the Wind being contrary, we never heard.
Some Time after that again, they were still more agreeably surpris'd
with seeing our Lights, and hearing the Guns, which, as I have said,
I caused to be fired all the rest of the Night; this set them to work
with their Oars, to keep their Boats a-head, at least, that we might
the sooner come up with them; and at last, to their inexpressible Joy,
they found we saw them.
It is impossible for me to express the several Gestures, the strange
Ecstasies, the Variety of Postures which these poor deliver'd People
run into, to express the Joy of their Souls at so unexpected a Delive-
rance; Grief and Fear are easily described; Sighs, Tears, Groans,
and a very few Motions of the Head and Hands make up the Sum of
its Variety: But an Excess of Joy, a Surprise of Joy, has a Thousand
Extravagances in it; there were some in Tears, some raging, and
tearing themselves, as if they had been in the greatest Agonies of
Sorrow, some stark-raving and downright lunatic, some ran about the
Ship stamping with their Feet, others wringing their Hands; some
were dancing, some singing, some laughing, more crying; many quite
dumb, not able to speak a Word; others sick and vomiting, several
swooning, and ready to faint; and a few were crossing themselves,
and giving God Thanks.
I would not wrong them neither, there might be many that were
thankful afterward, but the Passion was too strong for them at first,
tnd they were not able to master it, they were thrown into Ecstasies
-md a Kind of Frenzy, and it was but a very few that were compos'd
and serious in their Joy.
Perhaps the Case may have some Addition to it from the particular
Circumstance of that Nation they belong'd to, I mean the Frmch,
whose Temper is allow'd to be more volatile, more passionate, and
more sprightly, and their Spirits more fluid than in other Nations. I
am not Philosopher enough to determine the Cause, but nothing I
had ever seen before came up to it: The Ecstasies poor Friday, my
trusty Savage, was in when he found his Father in the Boat, came the
nearest to it, and the Surprise of the Master and his two Companions
whom I deliver'd from the Villains that set them on Shore in the Island,
came a little Way towards it, but nothing was to compare to this,
either that I saw in Friday, or anywhere else in my Life.
It is further observable, that these Extravagancies did not show
themselves in that different Manner I have mention'd in different
Persons only: But all the Variety would appear in a short Succession
of Moments in one and the same Person. A Man that we saw this
Minute dumb, and as it were stupid and confounded, should the next
Minute be dancing and hallooing like an Antic; and the next Moment
be tearing his Hair, or pulling his Clothes to Pieces, and stamping
Jiem under his Feet, like a Madman; and a few Moments after that,
we should have him all in Tears, then sick, then swooning; and had
not immediate Help been had, would, in a few Moments more have
been dead; and thus it was not with one or two, or ten or twenty,
but with the greatest Part of them; and if I remember right, our
Surgeon was oblig'd to let above thirty of them Blood.
There were two Priests among them, one an old Man, and the
other a young Man; and that which was strangest was, that the oldest
Man was the worst As soon as he set his Foot on board our Ship,
and saw himself safe, he dropped down stone-dead, not the least Sign
of Life could be perceiv'd in him; our Surgeon immediately appl/d
proper Remedies to recover him, and was the only Man in the Ship
that believ'd he was not dead: at length he opened a Vein in his
Arm, having first chafed and rubbed the Part so as to warm it as
much as possible: Upon this the Blood which only dropped at first,
flowed something freely; in three Minutes after, the Man open'd his
Eyes, and about a quarter of an Hour after that he spoke, grew
better, and quite well; after the Blood was stopped, he walked
about, told us he was perfectly well, took a Dram of Cordial
whicn the Surgeon gave him, and was what we called, Come to
Himself; about a quarter of an Hour after they came running into
the Cabin to the Surgeon, who was bleeding a French Woman, that
had fainted ; and told him, the Priest was gone stark mad; it seems he
had begun to revolve the Change of his Circumstance, and again this
put him into an Ecstasy of Joy, his Spirits whirled about faster than
ihe Vessels could convey them; the Blood grew hot and feverish,
and the Man was as fit for Bedlam, as any Creature that ever was in
it; the Surgeon would not bleed him again in that Condition, but
gave him something to doze and put him to sleep, which after some
Time operated upon him, and he waked the next Morning perfectly
compos'd, and well.
The younger Priest behav'd with great Command of his Passion,
and was really an Example of a serious well-govern'd Mind; at his
first coming on board the Ship, he threw himself flat on his Face,
prostrating himself in Thankfulness for his Deliverance, in which I
unhappily and unseasonably disturb'd him, really thinking he had
been in a Swoon; but he spake calmly, thanked me, told me, he was
giving God Thanks for his Deliverance, and begged me to leave him
a few Moments, and that next to his Maker he would give me Thanks
also.
I was heartily sorry, that I disturb'd him, and not only left him, but
kept others from interrupting him also; he continued in that Posture
about three Minutes, or little more, after I left him, then came to me,
as he had said he would, and with a great deal of Seriousness and
Affection, but with Tears in his Eyes, thanked me that had under
God, given him and so many miserable Creatures their Lives: I told
him, I had no Room to move him to thank God for it, rather than
me: But I added, That it was nothing but what Reason and Humanity
dictated to all Men, and that we had as much Reason as he to give
Thanks to God, who had blessed us so far as to make us the Instru-
ments of his Mercy to so many of his Creatures.
After this, the young Priest apply'd himself to his Country-Folks,
labour'd to compose them; persuaded, entreated, argued, reason'd
with them, and did his utmost to keep them within the Exercise of
their Reason; and with some he had Success, though others were for
a Time out of all Government of themselves.
I cannot help committing this to Writing, as perhaps it may be
useful to those into whose Hands it may fall, for the guiding them-
selves in all the Extravagances of their Passions; for if an Excess of
Joy can carry Men out to such a length beyond the Reach of theii
Reason, what will not the Extravagances of Anger, Rage, and a prc-
vok'd Mind, carry us to? and indeed here I saw Reason for keeping
an exceeding Watch over our Passions of every Kind, as well those
of Joy and Satisfaction, as those of Sorrow and Anger.
We were something disordered by these Extravagances among oui
new Guests for the first Day, but when they had been retired, Lodgings
provided for them as well as our Ship would allow, and they had
slept heartily, as most of them did, they were quite another Sort oi
People the next Day.
Nothing of good Manners or civil Acknowledgments for the Kind-
ness shown them was wanting; the French, it is known, are naturally
apt to exceed that Way. The Captain and one of the Priests came to
me the next Day, and desiring to speak with me and my Nephew,
the Commander, began to consult with us what should be done with
them; and first they told us, that as we had saved their Lives, so all
they had was little enough for a Return to us for that Kindness re-
ceived. The Captain said, they had saved some Money and some
Things of Value in their Boats, caught hastily out of the Flames,
and if we would accept it, they were ordered to make an Offer of it
all to us; they only desired to be set on Shore somewhere in our
Way, where if possible they might get Passage to France.
My Nephew was for accepting their Money at first Word, and to
consider what to do with them afterwards; but I overrul'd him in
that Part, for I knew what it was to be set on Shore in a strange
Country; and if the Portugal Captain that took me up at Sea had
served me so, and took all I had for my Deliverance, I must have
starved, or have been as much a Slave at the Brasils as I had been
in Barbary, the mere being sold to a Mahometan excepted; and
perhaps a Portuguese is not much a better Master than a Turk, if not
in some Cases a much worse.
I therefore told the French Captain that we had taken them up in
their Distress, it was true; but that it was our Duty to do so as we
were Fellow-Creatures, and as we would desire to be so deliver'd if
we were in the like or any other Extremity; that we had done
nothing for them but what we believed they would have done for us,
if we had been in their Case, and they in ours; but that we took
them up to save them, not to plunder them; and it would be a most
barbarous thing to take that little from them which they saved out of
the Fire, and then set them on Shore and leave them; that this
would be first to save them from Death, and then kill them our-
selves; save them from drowning, and abandon them to starving;
and therefore I would not let the least thing be taken from them:
As to setting them on Shore, I told them indeed that was an exceed-
ing Difficulty to us, for that the Ship was bound to the East Indies;
and though we were driven out of our Course to the Westward a very
great Way, and perhaps were directed by Heaven on Purpose for their
Deliverance, yet it was impossible for us wilfully to change our Voyage
on this particular Account, nor could my Nephew, the Captain,
answer it to the Freighters, with whom he was under Charter-Party to
pursue his Voyage by the Way of Brasil, and all I knew we could do
for them, was to put ourselves in the Way of meeting with other Ships
homeward bound from the West Indies, and get them Passage, if pos-
sible, to England or France.
The first Part of the Proposal was so generous and kind, they could
not but be very thankful for it; but they were in a very great Con-
sternation, especially the Passengers, at the Notion of being carry'd
away to the East Indies, and they then entreated me, that seeing I
was driven so far to the Westward, before I met with them, I would
at least keep on the same Course to the Banks of Newfoundland,
where it was probable I might meet with some Ship or Sloop that
they might hire to carry them back to Canada, from whence they
came.
I thought this was but a reasonable Request on their Part, and
therefore I inclin'd to agree to it; for indeed I consider'd, that to carry
this whole Company to the East Indies, would not only be an intole-
rable Severity upon the poor People, but would be ruining our whole
Voyage by devouring all our Provisions; so 1 thought it no Breach
of Charter-Party, but what an unforeseen Accident made absolutely
necessary to us, and in which no one could say we were to blame;
for the Laws of God and Nature would have forbid that we should
refuse to take up two Boats full of People in such a distress'd Condi-
tion, and -the Nature of the Thing as well respecting ourselves as
the poor People, oblig'd us to set them on Shore somewhere or other
for their Deliverance; so I consented that we would carry them to
Newfoundland, if Wind and Weather would permit, and if not, that I
would carry them to Martinico in the West Indies.
The Wind continued fresh Easterly, but the Weather pretty good,
and as the Winds had continued in the Points between N.E. and
S.E. a long time, we missed several Opportunities of sending them
to France; for we met several Ships bound to Europe, whereof two
were French from St Christopher's, but they had been so long beating
up against the Wind, that they durst take in no Passengers for fear of
wanting Provisions for the Voyage, as well for themselves as for those
they should take in; so we were obliged to go on. It was about a
Week after this that we made the Banks of Navfoundland, where to
shorten my Story, we put all our French People on Board a Bark,
which they hired at Sea there, to put them on Shore, and afterwards
to carry them to France if they could get Provision to victual them-
selves with. When, I say, all the French went on Shore, I should
remember that the young Priest I spoke of, hearing we were bound
to the East Indies, desired to go the Voyage with us, and to be set
on Shore on the Coast of Coromandel, which I readily agreed to, for
I wonderfully liked the Man, and had very good Reason, as will
appear afterwards; also four of the Seamen entered themselves on our
Ship, and proved very useful fellows.
From hence we directed our Course for the West Indies, steering
away S. and S. by E. for about twenty Days together, sometimes little
or no Wind at all, when we met with another Subject for our Hu-
manity to work upon, almost as deplorable as that before.
It was in the Latitude of 27 Degrees 5 Minutes North, and the
19th Day of March 1694-5, when we spied a Sail, our Course S.E
and by S. We soon perceiv'd it was a large Vessel, and that she bore
up to us, but could not at first know what to make of her, till after
coming a little nearer, we found she had lost her Maintop-mast, Fore-
mast and Boltsprit, and presently she fired a Gun as a Signal of
Distress; the Weather was pretty good, Wind at N.N.W. a fresh
Gale, and we s6on came to speak with her.
We found her a Ship of Bristol, bound home from Barbadoes, but
had been blown out of the Road at Barbadoes a few Days before she
was ready to sail, by a terrible Hurricane, while the Captain and
Chief Mate were both gone on Shore, so that beside the Terror of
the Storm, they were but in an indifferent Case for good Artists to
bring the Ship home: They had been already nine Weeks at Sea,
and had met with another terrible Storm after the Hurricane was overi
which had blown them quite out of their Knowledge to the Westward)
and in which they lost their Masts, as above; they told us they
expected to have seen the Bahama Islands, but were then driven
away again to the South-East by a strong Gale of Wind at N.N.W.
the same that blew now, and having no Sails to work the Ship with
but a main Course, and a kind of square Sail upon a Jury Foremast,
which they had set up, they could not lie near the Wind, but were
endeavouring to stand away for the Canaries.
But that which was worst of all, was, that they were almost starved foi
want of Provisions, besides the Fatigues they had undergone; their
Bread and Flesh was quite gone, they had not one Ounce left in the
Ship, and had had none for eleven Days; the only Relief they had,
was, their Water was not all spent, and they had about half a Barrel
of Flour left; they had Sugar enough; some Succades or Sweet-
meats they had at first, but they were devour'd, and they had seven
Casks of Rum.
There was a Youth and his Mother and a Maid-Servant on Board,
who were going Passengers, and thinking tlie Ship was ready to sail,
unhappily came on Board the Evening before the Hurricane began,
and having no Provisions of their own left, they were in a more de-
plorable Condition than the rest, for the Seamen being reduced to
such an extreme Necessity themselves, had no Compassion, we may
be sure, for the poor Passengers, and they were indeed in a Condi-
tion that their Misery is very hard to describe.
I had, perhaps, not known this Part, if my Curiosity had not led
me, the Weather being fair and the Wind abated, to go on Board the
Ship: The Second Mate who upon this Occasion commanded the
Ship, had been on Board our Ship, and he told me indeed they had
three Passengers in the great Cabin, that were in a deplorable Con-
dition; nay, says he, I believe they are dead, for I have heard
nothing of them for above two Days, and I was afraid to inquire after
them, said he, for I had nothing to relieve them with.
We immediately apply'd ourselves to give them what Relief we
could spare; and indeed I had so far overruled Things with my
Nephew, that I would have victuall'd them, though we had gone
away to Virginia, or any Part of the Coast of America, to have sup-
ply'd ourselves, but there was no Necessity for that
But now they were in a new Danger; for they were afraid of
eating too much, even of that little we gave them; the Mate or
Commander brought six Men with bim in his Boat, but these poor
Wretches looked like Skeletons, and were so weak, they could hardlj
sit to their Oars: The Mate himself was very ill, and half starved;
for he declar'd he had reserv'd nothing from the Men, and went
Share and Share alike with them in every Bit they eat
I caution'd him to eat sparingly, but set Meat before him imme-
diately, and he had not eaten three Mouthfuls before he began to be
Sick, and out of Order; so he stopped a while, and our Surgeon
mixed him up something with some Broth, which he said would be to
him both Food and Physic; and after he had taken it, he grew better:
In the meantime, I forgot not the Men; I order'd Victuals to be
given them, and the poor Creatures rather devour^ than eat it; they
were so exceeding hungry, that they were in a kind ravenous, and had
no Command of themselves; and two of them eat with so much
Greediness, that they were in Danger of their Lives the next
Morning.
The Sight of these People's Distress was very moving to me, and
brought to Mind what I had a terrible Prospect of at my first coming
on Shore in the Island, where I had neither the least Mouthful of
Food, or any Prospect of procuring any; besides the hourly Appre-
hension I had of behlg made the Food of other Creatures: But all
rhe while the Mate was thus relating to me the miserable Conditio*
of the Ship's Company, I could not put out of my Thought the Story
he had told me of the three poor Creatures in the Great Cabin, (viz.)
the Mother, her Son, and the Maid-servant, whom he had heard
nothing of for two or three Days, and whom he seemed to confess
they had wholly neglected, their own Extremities being so great; by
which I understood, that they had really given them no Food at all,
and that therefore they must be perish'd, and be all lying dead per-
haps on the Floor, or Deck of the Cabin.
As I therefore kept the Mate, whom we then called Captain, on
board with his Men to refresh them, so I also forgot not the
starving Crew that were left on board, but order'd my own Boat
to go on board the Ship, and with my Mate and twelve Men to
carry them a Sack of Bread, and four or five Pieces of Beef to
boil. Our Surgeon charged the Men to cause the Meat to be
boiled while they stayed, and to keep Guard in the Cook-Room,
to prevent the Men taking it to eat raw, or taking it out of the
Pot before it was well bciled, and then to give every Man but a
very little at a Time; and by this Caution he preserv'd the Men,
who would otherwise have killed themselves with that very Food
that was given them on Purpose to save their Lives.
At the same Time, I order'd the Mate to go into the Great
Cabin, and see what Condition the poor Passengers were in, and
if they were alive, to comfort them, and give them what Refresh-
ment was proper; and the Surgeon gave him a large Pitcher with
some of the prepar'd Broth which he had given the Mate that was
on board, and which he did not question would restore them
gradually.
I was not satisfy'd with this, but as I said above, having a great
Mind to see the Scene of Misery, which I knew the Ship itself would
present me with, in a more lively Manner than I could have it by Re-
port, I took the Captain of the Ship, as we now called him, with me,
and went myself a little after in their Boat
I found the poor Men on board almost in a Tumult to get the
Victuals out of the Boiler before it was ready: But my Mate observ'd
his Order, and kept a good Guard at the Cook-Room Door, and the
Man he placed there, after using all possible Persuasion to have
Patience, kept them off by Force: However, he caused some Biscuit
Cakes to be dipped in the Pot, and soften'd with the Liquor of the
Meat, which they call Brews, and gave them every one, one, to stay
their Stomachs, and told them it was for their own Safety that he was
oblig'd to give them but a little at Time: But it was all in vain; and
had I not come on board, and their own Commander and Officers
with me, and with good Words, and some Threats also of giving them
so more, I believe they would have broke into the Cook-Room by
Force, and tore the Meat out of the Furnace: For Words are indeed
of very small Force to a hungry Belly: However, we pacify'd them,
and fed them gradually and cautiously for the first Time, and the
next Time gave them more, and at last filled their Bellies, and the
Men did well enough.
But the Misery of the poor Passengers in the Cabin, was of
another Nature, and far beyond the rest; for as first the Ship's Com-
pany had so little for themselves, it was but too true that they had at
first kept them very low, and at last totally neglected them; so that
for six or seven Days, it might be said, they had really had no Food
at all, and for several Days before very little. The poor Mother, who
as the Men reported, was a Woman of good Sense and good Breed-
ing, had spared all she could get, so affectionately for her Son, that
at last she entirely sunk under it: And when the Mate o( our Ship
went in, she sat upon the Floor or Deck, with her Back up against
the Sides, between two Chairs, which were lashed fast, and her Head
sunk in between her Shoulders, like a Corpse, though not quite dead,
My Mate said all he could to revive and encourage her, and with a
Spoon put some Broth into her Mouth; she open'd her Lips, and
lifted up one Hand, but could not speak; yet she understood what
he said, and made Signs to him, intimating, that it was too late for
her, but pointed to her Child, as if she would have said, they should
take Care of him.
However, the Mate, who was exceedingly moved with the Sight,
endeavour'd to get some of the Broth into her Mouth; and as he
said, got two or three Spoonfuls down, though I question whether
he could be sure of it or not: But it was too late, and she died the
same Night
The Youth, who was preserved at the Price of his most affectionate
Mother's Life, was not so far gone, yet he lay in a Cabin-bed as one
stretched out, with hardly any Life left in him; he had a Piece of an
old Glove in his Mouth, having eaten up the rest of it; however,
being young, and having more Strength than his Mother, the
Mate got something down his Throat, and he began sensibly
to revive, though by giving him some time after but two or three
Spoonfuls extraordinary, he was very sick, and brought it up
again.
But the next Care was the poor Maid, she lay all along upon the
Deck hard by her Mistress, and just like one that had fallen down
with an Apoplexy and struggled for Life: Her Limbs were distorted,
one of her Hands was clasped round the Frame of a Chair, and she
griped it so hard, that we could not easily make her let go; her other
Arm lay over her Head, and her Feet lay both together set fast against
the Frame of the Cabin Table; in short, she lay just like one in the
last Agonies of Death, and yet she was alive too.
The poor Creature was not only starved with Hunger, and terrify'd
with the Thoughts of Death, but as the Men told us afterwards,
was broken-hearted for her Mistress, whom she saw dying for two or
three Days before, and whom she loved most tenderly.
We knew not what to do with this poor Girl, or when our Surgeon,
who was a Man of very great Knowledge and Experience, had with
great Application recover'd, her as to Life; he had her upon his Hand
AS to her Senses, for she was little less than distracted for a consider-
able Time after, as shall appear presently.
Whoever shall read these Memorandums must be desir'd to consider,
that Visits at Sea are not like a Journey into the Country, where some-
times People stay a Week or a Fortnight at a Place. Our Business was
to relieve this distressed Ship's Crew, but not to lie by for them; and
though they were willing to steer the same Course with us for some
Days, yet we could carry no Sail to keep Pace with a Ship that had
no Masts; however, as their Captain begged of us to help him to set
up a Maintop-mast, and a Kind of a Top-mast to his Jury Fore-
mast We did, as it were, lie by him for three or four Days, and then
having given him five Barrels of Beef, a Barrel of Pork, two
Hogsheads of Biscuit, and a Proportion of Peas, Flour, and what
other Things we could spare; and taking three Casks of Sugar, some
Rum, and some Pieces of Eight of them for Satisfaction, we left
them, taking on board with us, at their own earnest Request, the
Priest, the Youth, and the Maid, and all their Goods.
The young Lad was about seventeen Years of Age, a pretty, well-
bred, modest, and sensible Youth, greatly dejected with the Loss of
his Mother, and as it seems had lost his Father but a few Months
before at Barbadoes. He begged of the Surgeon to speak to me to
take him out of the Ship, for he said the cruel Fellows had murder'd
his Mother; and indeed so they had, that is to say passively; for they
might have spared a small Sustenance to the poor helpless Widow,
that might have preserved her Life, though it had been but just to keep
her alive. But Hunger knows no Friend, no Relation, no Justice, no
Right, and therefore is remorseless, and capable of no Compassion.
The Surgeon told him how far we were going, and how it would
carry him away from all his Friends, and put him perhaps in as bad
Circumstances almost as those we found him in; that is to say, starv-
ing in the World. He said it matter'd not whither he went, if he
was but delivered from the terrible Crew he was among: That the
Captain (by which he meant me, for he could know nothing of my
Nephew) had saved his Life, and he was sure would not hurt him;
and as for the Maid, he was sure, if she came to herself, she would be
very thankful for it, let us carry them where we would. The Surgeon
represented the Case so affectionately to me, that I yielded, and we
took them both on board with all their Goods, except eleven Hogs-
heads of Sugar, which could not be removed, or come at, and as tho
Youth had a Bill of Lading for them, I made his Commander sign a
Writing, obliging himself to go as soon as he came to Bristol, to one
Mr. Rogers a Merchant there, to whom the Youth said he was related,
and to deliver a Letter which I wrote to him, and all the Goods he
had belonging to the deceased Widow; which I suppose was not
done, for I could never learn that the Ship came to Bristol, but was,
as is most probable, lost at Sea, being in so disabled a Condition and
so far from any Land, that I am of Opinion, the first Storm she met
with afterwards, she might founder in the Sea, for she was leaky, and
had Damage in her Hold when we met with her.
I was now in the Latitude of 19 Deg. 32 Min. and had hitherto had
a tolerable Voyage as to Weather, though at first the Winds had
been contrary. I shall trouble nobody with the little Incidents of
Wind, Weather, Currents, 6-*c. on the rest of our Voyage; but short-
ening my Story for the sake of what is to follow, shall observe that I
came to my old Habitation, the Island, on the 10th of April 1695.
It was with no small Difficulty that I found the Place; for as I came
to it, and went from it before, on the South and East Side of the
Island, as coming from the Brasils, so now coming in between the
Main and the Island, and having no Chart for the Coast, nor any
Landmark, I did not know it when I saw it, or know whether I saw
it or no.
We beat about a great while, and went on Shore on several Islands
in the Mouth of the great River Oronooque, but none for my Purpose.
Qnly this I -learned by my Coasting the Shore, that I was under one
great Mistake before, viz. that the Continent which I thought I saw,
from the Island I lived in, was really no Continent, but a long Island,
or rather a Ridge of Islands, reaching from one to the other Side of
the extended Mouth of that great River, and that the Savages who
came to my Island, were not properly those which we call Caribbees,
but Islanders, and other Barbarians of the same Kind, who inhabited
something nearer to our Side than the rest
In short, I visited several of these Islands to no Purpose; some I
found were inhabited, and some were not On one of them I found
some Spaniards, and thought they had lived there, but speaking with
them, found they had a Sloop lay in a Creek hard by, and they came
thither to make Salt, and to catch some Pearl Mussels if they could,
but that they belong^ to the Isle de Trinidad, which lay farther North
in the Latitude of 10 and n Degrees.
But at last coasting from one Island to another, sometimes with the
Ship, sometimes with the French Man's Shallop, which we had found
a convenient Boat, and therefore kept her with their very good Will;
at length I came fair on the South Side of my Island, and I presently
knew the very Countenance of the Place; so I brought the Ship
safe to an Anchor, Broadside with the little Creek where was my
old Habitation.
As soon as I saw the Place, I called for Friday, and asked him if he
knew where he was? He looked about a little, and presently clapping
his Hands, cried; O yes, O there, Oyes, O there, pointing to our old
Habitation, and fell a dancing and capering like a mad Fellow, and
I had much ado to keep him from jumping into the Sea, to swim
ashore to the Place.
Well, Friday, says I, do you think we shall find anybody here or
no? And what do you think, shall we see your Father? The Fellow
stood mute as a Stock a good while, but when I named his Father,
the poor affectionate Creature looked dejected, and I could see the
Tears run down his Face very plentifully. What is the Matter,
Friday, says I? Are you troubled because you may see your Father?
No, no, says he, shaking his Head, no see him more, no ever more see
again; -why so, said I, Friday, how do you know that? O no, O no,
•ays Friday, he long ago die, long ago; he much old Man. Well,
well, says I, Friday, you don't know; but shall we see any one else
then? The Fellow, it seems, had better Eyes than I, and he points
just to the Hill above my old House; and though we lay half a
League off, he cries out, we see! we see! yes, we see much Men there,
and there, and there. T looked, but I could see nobody, no not with
a Perspective Glass, which was, I suppose, because I could not hit the
Place, for the Fellow was right, as I found upon Enquiry the next
Day, and there was five or six Men altogether, stood to look at the
Ship, not knowing what to think of us.
As soon as Friday had told me he saw People, I caused the English
Ancient to be spread, and fired three Guns, to give them Notice we
were Friends, and in about half a Quarter of an Hour after, we per-
ceiv'd a Smoke rise from the Side of the Creek, so I immediately
order'd a Boat out, taking Friday with me, and hanging out a white
Flag, or Flag of Truce, I went directly on Shore, taking with me
the young Friar I mention'd, to whom I had told the whole Story of
my living there, and the manner of it, and every Particular both of
ADVENTURES OF
myself, and those I left there; and who was on tiiat Account ex-
tremely desirous to go with me. We had besides about sixteen Men
very well armed, if we had found any new Guests there which we did
not know of; but we had no Need of Weapons.
As we went on Shore upon the Tide of Flood, near high Watei^
we rowed directly into the Creek, and the first Man I fixed my Eye
upon, was the Spaniard whose Life I had saved, and whom I knew
by his Face perfectly well; as to his Habit I shall describe it after-
wards. I order'd nobody to go on Shore at first but myself, but
there was no keeping Friday in the Boat; for the affectionate

—.^^t.
Creature had spied his Father at a Distance, a good Way off of the
Spaniards, where indeed I saw nothing of him; and if they had not
let him go on Shore, he would have jumped into the Sea. He was
no sooner on Shore, but he flew away to his Father like an Arrow
out of a Bow. It would have made any Man have shed Tears in
Spite of the firmest Resolution, to have seen the first Transports of
this poor Fellow's Joy when he came to his Father; how he embrac'd
him, kissed him, stroked his Face, took him up in his Arms, set him
down upon a Tree, and lay down by him, then stood and looked at
him, as any one would look at a strange Picture for a Quarter of an
30§
tloui together; then lie down on the Ground, and stroke his Legs,
and kiss them, and then get up again, and stare at him; one would
nave thought the Fellow bewitch'd: But it would have made a Dog
laugh to see how the next Day his Passion run out another Way: In
the Morning he walked along the Shore, to and again, with hi*
Father several Hours, always leading him by the Hand, as if he had
been a Lady; and every now and then he would come to fetch
something or other for him to the Boat, either a Lump of Sugar, or
a Dram, a Biscuit Cake, or something or other that was good. In
the Afternoon his Frolics run another Way; for then he would set
the old Man down upon O'.ie Ground, and dance about him, and

make a Thousand antic Postures and Gestures; and all the while he
did this, he would be talking to him, and telling him one Story or
another of his Travels, and of what had happen'd to him Abroad, to
divert him. In short, if the same filial Affection was to be found in
Christians to their Parents, in our Part of the World, one would be
tempted to say, there would hardly have been any Need of the fifth
Commandment.
But this is a Digression; I return to my Landing. It would be
endless to take Notice of all the Ceremonies and Civilities that the
Spaniards receiv'd me with. The first Spaniard whom, as I said. I
knew very well, was he whose Life I had saved; he came towards
the Boat, attended by one more, carrying a Flag of Truce also; and
he did not only not know me at first, but he had no Thoughts, no
Notion of its being me that was come, till I spoke to him: Seignor,
said I in Portuguese, Do you not know me? At which he spoke not
a Word; but giving his Musket to the Man that was with him, threw
his Arms abroad, and saying something in Spanish, that I did not
perfectly hear, comes forward, and embrac'd me, telling me he was
inexcusable, not to know that Face again, that he had once seen, as
of an Angel from Heaven sent to save his Life: He said Abundance
of very handsome Things, as a well-bred Spaniard always knows
how; and then beckoning to the Person that attended him, bade him
go and call out his Comrades. He then asked me, if I would walk
to my old Habitation, where he would give me Possession of my own
House again, and where I should see there had been but mean Im-
provements; so I walked along with him; but alas I could no
more find the Place again, than if I had never been there; for they
had planted so many Trees, and placed them in such a Posture, so
thick and close to one another; and in ten Years' Time they were
grown so big, that in short the Place was inaccessible, except by
such Windings and blind Ways, as they themselves only, who made
them, could find.
I asked them what put them upon all these Fortifications? He
told me, I would say there was Need enough of it, when they had
given me an Account how they had passed their Time since their
Arriving in the Island, especially after they had the Misfortune to
find that I was gone: He told me, he could not but have some
Satisfaction in my good Fortune, when he heard that I was gone
away in a good Ship, and to my Satisfaction; and that he had often
times a strong Persuasion, that one Time or other he should see me
again: But nothing that ever befel him in his Life, he said, was so
surprising and afflicting to him at first, as the Disappointment he
was under when he came back to the Island, and found I was not
there.
As to the three Barbarians (so he called them) that were left
behind, and of whom he said he had a long Story to tell me; the
Spaniards all thought themselves much better among the Savages,
only that their Number was so small. And, says he, had they been
strong enough, we had been all long ago in Purgatory; and with
that he crossed himself on the Breast: But Sir, says he, I hope yoi
will not be displeas'd, when I shall tell you how forced by Necessity
we were oblig'd, for our own Preservation to disarm them, and make
them our Subjects, who would not be content with being moderately
our Masters, but would be our Murderers. I answer'd, I was heartily
afraid of it when I left them there; and nothing troubled me at my
parting from the Island, but that they were not come back, that I
might have put them in Possession of everything first, and left the
other in a State of Subjection, as they deserv'd: But if they had
reduc'd them to it, I was very glad, and should be very far from
finding any Fault with it; for I knew they were a Parcel of refractory,
ungovern'd Villains, and were fit for any Manner of Mischief.
While I was saying this, came the Man whom he had sent back,
and with him eleven Men more: In the Dress they were in, it was
impossible to guess what Nation they were of: But he made all clear
both to them and to ma. First he turned to me, and pointing to them,
said, These, Sir, are some of the Gentlemen who owe their Lives to
you; and then turning to them, and pointing to me, he let them
know who I was; upon which they all came up one by one, not as if
they had been Sailors and ordinary Fellows, and I the like, but
really, as if they had been Ambassadors or Noblemen, and I a
Monarch or a great Conqueror; their Behaviour was to the last
Degree obliging and courteous, and yet mixed with a Manly, Majestic
Gravity, which veiy well became them; and in short, they had so
much more Manners than I, that I scarce knew how to receive their
Civilities, much less how to return them in Kind.
The History of their coming to, and Conduct in the Island, after
my going away, is so very remarkable, and has so many Incidents,
which the former Part of my Relation will help to understand, and
which will in most of the Particulars, refer to that Account I have
already given, that I cannot but commit them with great Delight to
the reading of those that come after me.
I shall no longer trouble the Story with a Relation in the first
Person, which will put me to the Expense of ten Thousand said fs,
and said he's, and he told trie's, and I told him's, and the like, but
I shall collect the Facts Historically, as near as I can gather them out
Of my Memory from what they related to me, and from what I met
with in my conversing with them and with the Place.
In order to do this succinctly, and as intelligibly as I can, I musl
go back to the Circumstance in which I left the Island, and in which
the Persons were of whom I am to speak. And first it is necessary
to repeat, that I had sent away Friday's Father and the Spaniard, the
two whose Lives I had rescued from the Savages; I say, I had sent
them away in a large Canoe to the Main, as I then thought it, to fetch
over the Spaniard's Companions who he had left behind him, in
order to save them from the like Calamity that he had been in, and
in order to succour them for the present, and that if possible, we
might together find some Way for our Deliverance afterward.
When I sent them away, I had no visible Appearance of, or the
least Room to hope for my own Deliverance any more than I had
twenty Years before, much less had I any Fore-knowledge of what,
afterwards happened, I mean of an English Ship coming on Shore
there to fetch me off: and it could but be a very great Surprise to
them when they came back, not only to find that I was gone, but to
find three Strangers left on the Spot, possess'd of all that I had left
behind me, which would otherwise have been their own.
The first Thing, however, which I inquir'd into, that I might begin
where I left off, was of their own Part; and I desir'd he would give
me a particular Account of his Voyage back to his Countrymen with
the Boat, when I sent him to fetch them over. He told me there
was little Variety in that Part, for nothing remarkable happen'd to
them on the Way, they having very calm Weather, and a smooth
Sea; for his Countrymen it could not be doubted, he said, but that they -
were overjoy'd to see him: (It seems he was the principal Man
among them, the Captain of the Vessel they had been shipwreck'd in,
having been dead some Time) they were, /u said, the more surprised
to see him, because they knew that he was fallen into the Hands of the
Savages, who, they were satisfy'd, would devour him as they did all
the rest of the Prisoners; that when he told them the Story of his
Deliverance, and in what Manner he was furnish'd for carrying them
away, it was like a Dream to them; and their Astonishment, they
said, was something like that of Joseph's Brethren, when he told them
who he was, and told them the Story of his Exaltation in Pharaoh's
Court: But when he showed them the Arms, the Powder, the Ball,
and the Provisions that he brought them for their Journey or Voyage,
they were restor'd to themselves, took a just Share of the Joy
of their Deliverance, and immediately prepar'd to come away with
him
307
Their first Business was to get Canoes; and in this they were
obliged not to stick so much upon the honest Part of it, but to
trespass upon their friendly Savages, and to borrow two large
Canoes, or Periaguas, on Pretence of going out a Fishing, or for
Pleasure.
In these they came away the next Morning; it seems they wanted
no Time to get themselves ready; for they had no Baggage, neither
Clothes or Provisions, or anything in the World, but what they had
on them, and a few Roots to eat, of which they used to make their
Bread.
They were in all three Weeks absent, and in that Time, unluckily
for them, I had the Occasion offend for my Escape, as I mention'd
in my other Part, and to get off from the Island, leaving three of the

.-.%?
most impudent, harden'd, ungovern'd, disagreeable Villains behind
me, that any Man could desire to meet with, to the poor Spaniard?
great Grief and Disappointment, you may be sure.
The only just Thing the Rogues did, was, That when the Spaniards
came on Shore, they gave my Letter to them, and gave them Provi-
sions and other Relief, as I had ordered them to do; also they gave
them the long Paper of Directions which I had left with them, con-
taining the particular Methods which I took for managing every Part
of my Life there, the Way how I baked my Bread, bred up tame
Goats, and planted my Corn, how I cured my Grapes, made my Pots,
and, in a Word, everything I did, all this being written down, they
gave to the Spaniards, two of whom understood English well enough;
nor did they refuse to accommodate the Spaniards with everything
else, for they agreed very well for some Time; they gave them an
equal Admission into the House, or Cave, and they began to live
very sociably, and the Head Spaniard, who had seen pretty much of
my Methods, and Friday's Father together, manag'd all their Affairs;
for, as for the Englishmen, they did nothing but ramble about the
Island, shoot Parrots, and catch Tortoises, and when they came
home at Night, the Spaniards provided their Suppers for them.
The Spaniards would have been satisfy'd with this, would the other
but have let them alone, which, however, they could not find in their
Hearts to do long; but like the Dog in the Manger, they would not
eat themselves, and would not let others eat neither: The Differ-
ences, nevertheless, were at first but trivial, and such as are not
worth relating; but at last it broke out into open War, and it begun
with all the Rudeness and Insolence that can be imagin'd, without
Reason, without Provocation, contrary to Nature, and indeed, to
common Sense; and though it is true the first Relation of it came from
the Spaniards themselves, whom I may call the Accusers, yet when I
came to examine the Fellows, they could not deny a Word of it
But before I come to the Particulars of this Part, I must supply a
Defect in my former Relation, and this was, that I forgot to set down
among the rest, that just as we were weighing the Anchor to set Sail,
there happen'd a little Quarrel on board our Ship, which I was afraid
once would have turned to a second Mutiny; nor was it appeas'd, till
the Captain rousing up his Courage, and taking us all to his Assis-
tance, parted them by Force, and making two of the most refractory
Fellows Prisoners, he laid them in Irons, and as they had been
active in the former Disorders, and let fall some ugly dangerous
Words the second Time, he threaten'd to carry them in Irons to
England, and have them hanged there for Mutiny, and running away
with the Ship.
This it seems, though the Captain did not intend to do it, frighted
some other Men in the Ship, and some of them had put it into the
Heads of the rest, that the Captain only gave them good Words for
the present, till they should come to some English Port, and that then
they should be all put into Jail, and tried for their Lives.
The Mate got Intelligence of this, and acquainted us with it; upon
which it was desir'd, that I, who still passed for a great Man among
them, should go down with the Mate, and satisfy the Men, and CjD
them, that they might be assur'd, if they Lchav'd well the rest of the
Voyage, all they had done for the Time past should be pardon'd. So I
went, and after passing my Honour's Word to them, they appear'd
easy; and the more so, when I caused the two Men, who were in
Irons, to be released and forgiven.
But this Mutiny had brought us to an Anchor for that Night, the
Wind also falling calm, next Morning we found, that our two
Men who had been laid in Irons, had stole each of them a Musket,
and some other Weapons, what Powder or Shot they had, we know
not; and had taken the Ship's Pinnace, which was not yet hauled
tip, and ran away with her to their Companions in Roguery on
Shore.
As soon as we found this, I order'd the Long-Boat on Shore, witi
twelve Men and the Mate, and away they went to seek the Rogues, but
they could neither find them, nor any of the rest; for they all fled into
the Woods when they saw the Boat coming on Shore. The Mate was
once resoVd, in Justice to their Roguery, to have destroy'd their
Plantations, burnt all their Household-Stuff and Furniture, and left
them to shift without it; but having no Order, he let it all alone, left
everything as they found it, and bringing the Pinnace away, came on
board without them.
These two Men made their Number five, but the other three Villains
were so much wickeder than these, that after they had been two or
three Days together, they turned their two New Comers out of Doors to
shift for themselves, and would have nothing to do with them, nor
could they for a good while be persuaded to give them any Food; as
for the Spaniards they were not yet come.
When the Spaniards came first on Shore, the Business began to go
forward; the Spaniards would have persuaded the three English
Brutes to have taken in their two Countrymen again, that, as they
said, they might be all one Family; but they would not hear of it:
So the two poor Fellows lived by themselves, and finding nothing
but Industry and Application would make them live comfortably,
they pitched their Tents on the North Shore of the Island, but a
little more on the West, to be out of the Danger of the Savages, who al-
ways landed on the East Parts of the Island.
Here they built them two Huts, one to lodge in, and the other to
lay up their Magazines and Stores in, and the Spaniards having given
them some Corn for Seed, and especially some of the Peas which I had
left tnem, they dug, and planted, and enclosed, after the Pattern 1
had set for them all, and began to live pretty well; their first Crop of
Cor n was on the Ground, and though it was but a little Bit of Land
which they had dug up at first, having had but a little Time, yet it
was enough to relieve them, and find them with Bread and othei
Eatables; and one of the Fellows being the Cook's Mate of the Ship,
was very ready at making Soup, Puddings, and other such Prepara-
tions, as the Rice, and the Milk, and such little Flesh as they got,
furnish'd him to do.
They were going on in this little thriving Posture, when the three
unnatural Rogues, their own Countrymen too, in mere Humour, and
to insult them, came and bully'd them, and told them, the Island was
theirs, that the Governor, meaning me, had given them Possession of
it, and nobody else had any Right to it, and damn them, they should
build no Houses upon their Ground, unless they would pay them Rent
for them.
The two Men thought they had jested at first, asked them to come
in and sit down, and see what fine Houses they were that they had
built, and tell them what Rent they demanded, and one of them
merrily told them, if they were Ground Landlords, he hoped, if they
built Tenements upon their Land, and made Improvements, they
would, according to the Custom of Landlords, grant them a long
Lease, and bid them go fetch a Scrivener to draw the Writings. One of
the three damning and raging, told them they should see they were not
in Jest, and going to a little Place at a Distance, where the honest Men
had made aFire to dress their Victuals, he takes a Firebrand, and claps
it to the Outside of their Hut, and very fairly set it on Fire, and it
would have been all burnt down in a few Minutes, if one of the two
had not run to the Fellow, thrust him away, and trod the Fire out
with his Feet, and that not without some Difficulty too.
The Fellow was in such a Rage at the honest Man's thrusting him
away, that he return'd upon him with a Pole he had in his Hand, and
had not the Man avoided the Blow very nimbly, and run into the
Hut, he had ended his Days at once; his Comrade seeing the
Danger they were both in, ran in after him, and immediately they came
both out with their Muskets, and the Man that was first struck at
with the Pole, knocked the Fellow down that begun the Quarrel,
with the Stock of his Musket, and that before the other two could
come to help him, and then seeing the rest come at them, they stood
together, and presenting the other Ends of their Pieces to tnem, bid
•Jiem stand off.
The other had Firearms with them too, but one of the two honest
Men, bolder than his Comrade, and made desperate by his Danger,
told them, if they offer'd to move Hand or Foot they were dead Men,
and boldly commanded them to lay down their Arms. They did not
indeed lay down their Arms, but seeing him so resolute, it brought
them to a Parley, and they consented to take their wounded Man
with them, and be gone; and indeed it seems the Fellow was wounded
sufficiently -with the Blow; however, they were much in the wrong,
since they had the Advantage, that they did not disarm them effec-
tually, as they might have done, and have gone immediately to the
Spaniards, and given them an Account how the Rogues had treated
them; for the three Villains studied nothing but Revenge, and every
Day gave them some Intimation that they did so.
But not to crowd this Part with an Account of the lesser Part of
their Rogueries, such as treading down their Corn, shooting three
young Kids, and a She-Goat, which the poor Men had got to breed
up tame for their Store; and, in a Word, plaguing them Night and
Day in this Manner, it forced the two Men to such a Desperation,
that they resolv'd to fight them all three the first Time they had a
fair Opportunity; in Order to this they resolv'd to go to the Castle, as
they called it, that was my old Dwelling, where the three Rogues
and the Spaniards all lived together/at that Time intending to have a
fair Battle, and the Spaniards should stand by to see fair Play; so they
got up in the Morning before Day, and came to the Place, and
jailed the Englishmen by their Names, telling a Spaniard, that
answer'd, that they wanted to speak with them.
It happen'd, that the Day before two of the Spaniards having been
in the Woods, had seen one of the two Englishmen, whom, for Dis-
tinction, I call ihelfonesl Men,andhe had made a sad Complaint to the
Spaniards of the barbarous Usage they had met with from their
three Countrymen, and how they had ruin'd their Plantation, and
destroy'd their Corn, that they had labour'd so hard to bring forward,
and killed the Milch-Goat and their three Kids, which was all they
had provided for their Sustenance, and that if he and his Friends,
meaning the Spaniards, did not assist them again, they should be
starved. When the Spaniards came home at Night, and they were all
at Supper, he took the Freedom to reprove the three Englishmen,
though in very gentle and mannerly Terms, and asked them, How
they could be so cruel, they being harmless inoffensive Fellows, and
that they were only putting themselves in a way to subsist by their
Labour, and that it had cost them a great deal of Pains to bring
things to such Perfection as they had?
One of the Englishmen return'd very briskly, what had they to do
there? That they came on Shore without Leave, and they should not
Plant or Build upon the Island, it was none of their Ground. Why, says
the Spaniard very calmly, Seignior Inglese, they must not starve. The
Englishman reply'd like a true rough-hewn Tarpaulin, they might
Starve and be Damned, they should not Plant nor Build. But what
must they do then, Seignior? said the Spaniard. Another of the
Brutes return'd, Do! D—n them, they should be Servants, and work
for them. But how can you expect that of them? says the Spaniard,
they are not bought with your Money; you have no Right to make
them Servants: The Englishman answer'd, the Island was theirs,
the Governor had given it to them, and no Man had anything to do
there but themselves; and with that swore by his Maker, that
they would go and burn all their new Huts, they should build none
upon their Land.
Why, Seignior, says the Spaniard, by the same Rule we must be
your Servants too. Ah, says the bold Dog, and so you shall too, be-
fore we have done with you, mixing two or three G—d Damme's in
the proper Intervals of his Speech; the Spaniard only smiled at
that, and made him no Answer: However, this little Discourse had
heated them, and starting up, one says to the other, I think it was
he they called Will Atkins, Come, Jack, let us go and have t'othei
Brush with them; we'll demolish their Castle, I'll warrant you, they
shall plant no Colony in our Dominions.
Upon this, they went all Trooping away, with every Man a Gun, a
Pistol, and a Sword, and mutter'd some insolent Things among them-
selves, of what they would do to the Spaniards too, when Opportunity
offer'd; but the Spaniards it seems did not so perfectly understand
them, as to know all the Particulars, only, that in general, they
threatened them hard for taking the two Englishmen's Part
Whether they went, or how they bestow'd their time that Evening,
the Spaniards said, they did not know; but it seems they wandered
about the Country, Part of the Night, and then lying down in the
Place which I used to call my Bower, they were weary, and overslept
313
themselves. The case was this, they had resolv'd to stay till Mid-
night, and so to take the two poor Men when they were asleep, and
as they acknowledg'd afterwards, intended to set Fire to their Huts
while they were in them, and either burn them in them, or murder
them as they came out, and as Malice seldom sleeps very sound, it
was very strange they should not have been kept waking.
However, as the two Men had also a Design upon them, as I have
said, though a much fairer one than that of Burning and Murdering,
it happen'd, and very luckily for them all, that they were up and
gone abroad, before the bloody-minded Rogues came to their Huts.
When they came there and found the Men gone, Atkins, who it
seems was the forwardest Man, called out to his Comrades, Yia.\/ack,
here's the Nest, but
^^.

D—n 'em the Birds
are flown; they
mused a while to
think what should
be the Occasion of
their being gone
abroad so soon, and
suggested presently,
that the Spaniards
had given them
Notice of it, and
with that they shook
Hands, and swore to
one another that they would be reveng'd of the Spaniards. As soon as
they had made this bloody Bargain they fell to work with the poor
Men's Habitation; they did not set Fire indeed to anything, but
they pulled down both their little Houses, and pulled them so Limb
from Limb, that they left not the least Stick standing, or scarce any
Sign on the Ground where they stood; they tore all their little col-
lected Household Stuff in Pieces, and threw everything about in such
a manner, that the poor Men afterwards found some of their Things
a Mile off of their Habitation.
When they had done this, they pulled up all the young Trees the
poor Men had planted, pulled up an Enclosure they had made to
secure their Cattle and their Corn; and in a word, sacked and plun-
der'd everything, as completely as a Horde of Tartars would have done,
The two Men were at this Juncture gone to find them out, and had
resolved to fight them wherever they had been, though they were but
two to three: So that had they met, there certainly would have been
Bloodshed among them, for they were all very stout resolute Fellows,
to give them their due.
But Providence took more Care to keep them asunder, than they
themselves could do to meet; for, as if they had dodged one another,
when the three were gone thither, the two were here; and afterwards
when the two went back to find them, the three were come to the old
Habitation again; we shall see their differing Conduct presently.
When the three came back like furious Creatures flushed with the
Rage which the Work they had been about had put them into, they
came up to the Spaniards, and told them what they had done, by way
of Scoff and Bravado; and one of them stepping up to one of the
Spaniards, as if they had been a Couple of Boys at Play, takes hold
of his Hat, as it was upon his Head, and giving it a Twirl about,
sneering in his Face, says he to him, And you, Seignior Jack Spaniard,
thall have the same Sauce, if you do not mend your Manners: The
Spaniard, who though a quiet civil Man, was as brave as a Man
could be desir'd to be, and withal a strong well-made Man, looked
steadily at him for a good while, and then having no Weapon in his
Hand, stepped gravely up to him, and with one Blow of his Fist
knocked him down, as an Ox is felled with a Pole-Axe; at which one
of the Rogues, insolent at the first, fired his Pistol at the Spaniard
immediately. He missed his Body indeed, for the Bullets went
through his Hair, but one of them touched the Tip of his Ear, and he
bled pretty much. The Blood made the Spaniard believe, he was
more hurt than he really was, and that put him into some Heat, for
before, he acted all in a perfect Calm; but now resolving to go
through with his Work, he stooped to take the Fellow's Musket whom
he had knocked down, and was just going to shoot the Man, and had
fired at him, when the rest of the Spaniards being in the Cave came
out, and calling to him not to shoot, they stepped in, secur'd the
other two, and took their Arms from them.
When they were thus disarm'd, and found they had made all the
Spaniards their Enemies, as well as their own Countrymen, they began
to cool, and giving the Spaniards better Words, would have had theii
Arms again; but the Spaniards considering the Feud that was between
them and the other two Englishmen, and that it would be the best
Method they could take to keep them from one another, told
them, they would do them no harm, and if they would live peaceably,
they would be very willing to assist and sociate with them, as they
did before; but that they could not think of giving them their Arms
again, while they appear'd so resolv'd to do Mischief with them to
their own Countrymen, and had even threatened them all, to make
them their Servants.
The Rogues were now no more capable to hear Reason, than to
act Reason, and being refus'd their Arms, they went raving away and
raging like Madmen, threatening what they would do, though they
had no Firearms. But the Spaniards, despising their Threatening,
told them they should take Care how they offer'd any Injury to their
Plantation or Cattle, for if they did, they would shoot them as they
would do ravenous Beasts, wherever they found them; and if they
fell into their Hands alive, they should certainly be hanged. How-
ever, this was far from cooling them, but away they went raging and
swearing like Furies of Hell. As soon as they were gone, came back
the two Men, in Passion and Rage enough also, though of another
Kind; for having been at their Plantation, and rinding it all demo-
lish'd and destroy'd, as above, it will easily be suppos'd they had
Provocation enough; they could scarce have Room to tell their Tale,
the Spaniards were so eager to tell them theirs; and it was strange
enough to find three Men thus bully nineteen, and receive no Punish-
ment at all.
The Spaniards indeed despised them, and especially having thus
disarm'd them, made light of all their Threatenings; but the two
Englishmen resolv'd to have their Remedy against them, what Pain
soever it cost to find them out
But the Spaniards interpos'd here too, and told them, that as they
had disarm'd them, they could not consent that they (the Two) should
pursue them with Firearms, and perhaps kill them; but, said the grave
Spaniard, who was their Governor, we will endeavour to make them
do you Justice if you will leave it to us, for as there is no doubt but
they will come to us again when their Passion is over, being not able
to subsist without our Assistance, we promise you to make no Peace
with them, without having a full Satisfaction for you; upon this Con-
dition we hope you will promise to use no Violence with them, other
than in your own Defence.
The two Englishmen yielded to this very awkwardly, and with sreai
Reluctance, but the Spaniards protested, they did it only to keep
them from Bloodshed, and to make all easy at last; for, said they,
we are not so many of us, here is Room enough for us all, and it is
great Pity we should not be all good Friends; at length they did
consent, and waited for the Issue of the Thing, living for some Days
with the Spaniards, for their own Habitation was destroyed.
In about five Days' Time the three Vagrants, tired with wandering
and almost starved with Hunger, having chiefly lived on Turtles' Eggs
all that while, came back to the Grove, and finding my Spaniard, who,
as I have said, was the Governor, and two more with him walking by
the Side of the Creek; they came up in a very submissive humble
Manner, and begged to be receiv'd again into the Family. The
Spaniards used them civilly, but told them, they had acted so unnatu-

rally by their Countrymen, and so very grossly by them (the Spaniards)
that they could not come to any Conclusion, without consulting the
two Englishmen and the rest; but however, they would go to them
and discourse about it, and they should know in half an Hour. It
may be guessed, that they were very hard put to it, for it seems, as
they were to wait this half Hour for an Answer, they begged they would
send them out some Bread in the meantime, which he did, and sent
them at the same Time a large Piece of Goat's Flesh, and a broiled
Parrot, which they eat very heartily, for they were hungry enough.
After half an Hour's Consultation they were called in, and a long
Debate had among them, their two Countrymen charging them with
the Ruin of all their Labour, and a Design to murder them; all which
they owned before, and therefore could not deny now; upon the
whole, the Spaniard acted the Moderator between them, and as they
had obliged the two Englishmen not to hurt the three while they were
flaked and unarmed, so they now obliged the three to go and build
their Fellows two Huts, one of the same, and the other cf larger
Dimensions, than they were before; to fence their Ground again,
where they had pulled up the Fences, plant Trees in the Room of
those pulled up, dig up the Land again for planting Corn, where they
had spoiled it: and in a Word, to restore everything in the same
State as they found it, as near as they could, for entirely it could not
be, the Season for the Corn, and the Growth of the Trees, and Hedges,
not being possible to be recovered.
Well, they submitted to all this, and as they had Plenty of Pro-
visions given them all the while, they grew very orderly, and the
whole Society began to live pleasantly and agreeably together, only
that these three Fellows could never be persuaded to work, I mean
for themselves, except now and then a little, just as they pleased;
however, the Spaniards told them plainly, that if they would but live
sociably and friendly together, and study in the whole the Good of
the Plantation, they would be content to work for them, and let them
walk about and be as idle as they pleased; and thus having lived
pretty well together for a Month or two, the Spaniards gave them
Arms again, and gave them Liberty to go abroad with them as
before.
It was not above a Week after they had these Arms, and went
abroad, but the ungrateful Creatures began to be as insolent and trouble-
some as before; but however, an Accident happening presently upon
this, which endanger'd the Safety of them all, they were oblig'd to
lay by all private Resentments, and look to the Preservation of their
Lives.
It happen'd one Night, that the Spaniard Governor, as I call him,
that is to say, the Spaniard, whose Life I had saved, who was now
the Captain, or Leader,, or Governor of the rest, found himself very
uneasy in the Night, and could by no Means get any Sleep; he was
perfectly well in Body, as he told me the Story, only found his
Thoughts tumultuous, his Mind run upon Men fighting and killing of
one another, but was broad awake, and could not by any Means get
any Sleep; in short, he lay a great while, but growing more and
more uneasy, he resolv'd to rise: As they lay, being so many of them,
upon Goat-skins, laid thick upon such Couches and Pads, as they
made for themselves, not in Hammocks and Ship Beds, as I did, who
was but one, so they had little to do, when they were willing to rise,
but to get up upon their Feet, and perhaps put on a Coat, such as it
was, and their Pumps, and they were ready for going any Way that
their Thoughts guided them.
Being thus gotten up, he looked out, but being dark, he could see
little or nothing, and besides, the Trees which I had planted, as in
my former Account is described, and which were now grown tall, in-
tercepted his Sight, so that he could only look up, and see that it was
a clear Starlight Night, and hearing no Noise, he return'd and laid
him down again; but it was all one, he could not sleep, nor could he
compose himself to anything like Rest, but his Thoughts were to the
last Degree uneasy, and yet he knew not for what
Having made some Noise with rising and walking about, going put
and coming in, another of them waked, and calling, asked, who it was
that was up? The Governor told him, how it had been with him.
Say you so, says the other Spaniard, such Things are not to be
slighted, I assure you; there is certainly some Mischief working, says
he, near us, and presently he asked him, where are the Englishmen t
They are all in their Huts, says he, safe enough. It seems, the
Spaniards had kept Possession of the main Apartment, and had made
a Place where the three Englishmen, since their last Mutiny always
quarter'd by themselves, and could not come at the rest Well, says
the Spaniard, there is something in it, I am persuaded from my own
Experience; I am satisfy'd our Spirits embodied have a Converse
with, and receive Intelligence from the Spirits unembodied and in-
habiting the invisible World, and this friendly Notice is given for our
Advantage, if we know how to make Use of it Come, says he, let
us go out and look abroad, and if we find nothing at all in it to justify
the Trouble, I'll tell you a Story to the Purpose, that shall convince
you of the Justice of my proposing it
In a Word, they went out to go to the Top of the Hill, where I
used to go, but they being strong and in good Company, not alone,
as I was, used none of my Cautions, to go up by the Ladder, and
then pulling it up after them, to go up a second Stage to the Top,
but were going round through the Grove unconcern'd and unwary,
when they were surpris'd with seeing a Light, as of Fire, a very little
Way off from them, and hearing the Voices of Men, not of one, or two,
but of a great Number.
In all the Discoveries 1 had made of the Savages landing on the
3«<3
Island, it was my constant Care to prevent them making the least
Discovery of there being any Inhabitant upon the Place; and when
by any Occasion they came to know it, they felt it so effectually, that
they that got away, were scarce able to give any Account of it, for we
disappear'd as soon as possible, nor did ever any that had seen me,
escape to tell any one else, except it were the three Savages in our
last Encounter, who jumped into the Boat, of whom I mention'd, that
I was afraid they should go Home and bring more Help.
Whether it was the Consequence of the Escape of those Men, that
so great a Number came now together, or whether they came igno-
rantly and by Accident on their usual bloody Errand, they could
not it seems understand; but whatever it was, it had been their Bust
ness, either to have conceal'd themselves, as not to have seen them
at all, much less to have let the Savages have seen that there were
any Inhabitants in the Place, or to have fallen upon them so effectu-
ally, as that not a Man of them should have escap'd, which could
only have been by getting in between them and their Boats; but
this Presence of Mind was wanting to them, which was the Ruin ol
their Tranquillity for a great while.
We need not doubt, but that the Governor and the Man with him,
surpris'd with this Sight ran back immediately, and raised then-
Fellows, giving them an Account of the imminent Danger they were
all in; and they again as readily took the Alarm, but it was impos-
sible to persuade them to stay close within where they were, but that
they must run all out to see how Things stood.
While it was dark indeed, they were well enough, and they had
Opportunity enough for some Hours to view them by the Light of
three Fires they had made at a Distance from one another; what they
were doing they knew not, and what to do themselves they knew not
For, first, the Enemy were too many; and secondly, they did not
keep together, but were divided into several Parties, and were on
Shore in several Places.
The Spaniards were in no small Consternation at this Sight, and
as they found that the Fellows ran straggling all over the Shore, they
made no Doubt, but first or last, some of them would chop in upon
their Habitation, or upon some other Place, where they would see the
Token of Inhabitants, and they were in great Perplexity also for fear
of their Flock of Goats, which would have been little less than starv-
ing them, if they should have been destroy'd; so the first Thing they
resolv'il upon, was to despatch three Men away before it was light, viz.
two Spaniards and one Englishman, to drive all the Goats away to
the great Valley where the Cave was, and if Need were, to drive
them into the very Cave itself.
Could they have seen the Savages altogether in one Body, and at
any Distance from their Canoes, they resolv'd, if they had been an
hundred of them, to have attack'd them; but that could not be ob
tain'd, for they were some of them two Miles off from the other, and,
as it appear'd afterwards, were of two different Nations.
After having mused a great while on the Course they should take,
and beaten their Brains in considering their present Circumstances,
they resolv'd at last, while it was dark, to send the old Savage, Fri-
day's Father, out as a Spy, to learn, if possible, something concerning
them, what they came for, and what they intended to do; the old
Man readily undertook it, and stripping himself quite naked, as most
of the Savages were, away he went: After he had been gone an Hour
or two, he brings Word, that he had been among them undiscover'd,
that he found they were two Parties, and of two several Nations who
had War with one another, and had had a great Battle in their own
Country, and that both Sides having had several Prisoners taken in
the Fight, they were by mere Chance landed all in the same Island,
for the devouring their Prisoners, and making merry; but their coming
so by Chance to the same Place had spoiled all their Mirth; that
they were in a great Rage at one another, and that they were so near,
that he believ'd they would fight again as soon as Daylight began to
appear; but he did not perceive that they had any Notion of any-
body's being on the Island but themselves. He had hardly made an
End of telling his Story, when they could perceive, by the un-
usual Noise they made, that the two little Annies were engag'd in a
bloody Fight
Friday's Father used all the Arguments he could to persuade our
people to lie close, and not be seen; he told them their Safety con-
sisted in it, and that they had nothing to do but lie still, and the
Savages would kill one another to their Hands, and then the rest
would go away; and it was so to a Tittle. But it was impossible V
prevail, especially upon the Englishmen, their Curiosity was so impor-
tunate upon their Prudentials, that they must run out and see the
Battle: However, they used some Caution too, (viz.) they did not go
openly, just by their own Dwelling, but went farther into the Woods,
3»«
and placed themselves to Advantage, where they might secirely see
them manage the Fight, and, as they thought, not to be seen by
them; but it seems the Savages did see them, as we shall find
hereafter.
The Battle was very fierce, and if I might believe the Englishmen,
one of them said, he could perceive, that some of them were Men of
great Bravery, of invincible Spirits, and of great Policy in guiding the
Fight The Battle, they said, held two Hours, before they could
guess which Party would be beaten; but then that Party which was
nearest our People's Habitation began to appear weakest, and after
some Time more, some of them began to fly; and this put our Men
again into a great Consternation, lest any of those that fled should
run into the Grove, before their Dwelling, for Shelter, and thereby
involuntarily discover the Place; and that by Consequence the Pur-
suers should do the like in Search for them. Upon this they resolv'd
that they would stand armed within the Wall, .and whoever came into
the Grove, they should sally out over the Wall and kill them ; so that,
if possible, not one should return to jr/ve an Account of it; they
order'd also, that it
should be done with
their Swords, or by
knocking them down
with the Stock of the
Musket, but not by
shooting them, for
fear of the Noise.
As they expected,
it fell out; three of
the routed Army fled
for Life, and, crossing
the Creek, ran directly
into the Place, not in
the least knowing whither they went, but running as into a thick Wood
for Shelter; the Scout they kept to look Abroad, gave Notice of this
within, with this Addition, to our Men's great Satisfaction (viz.) That
the Conquerors had not pursued them, or seen which Way they were
gone; upon this, the Spaniard Governor, a Man of Humanity,
would not suffer them to kill the three Fugitives, but sending three
Men out by the Top of the Hill, order'd them to go round and coma

in behind them, surprise and take them Prisoners, which was done;
the Residue of the conquer'd People fled to their Canoes and got
off to Sea; the Victors retir'd, and made no Pursuit or very little,
but drawing themselves into a Body together, gave two great scream-
ing Shouts, which they suppos'd was by way of Triumph, and so the
Fight ended: And the same Day, about three o'clock in the After-
noon, they also marched to their Canoes. And thus the Spaniards
had their Island again free to themselves, their Fright was over, and
they saw no Savages in several Years after.
After they were all gone, the Spaniards came out of their Den, and
viewing the Field of Battle, they found about two-and-thirty dead
Men upon the Spot; some were killed with great long Arrows, some
of which were found sticking in their Bodies; but most of them were
killed with their great wooden Swords, sixteen or seventeen of which
they found in the Field of Battle, and as many Bows, with a great
many Arrows: These Swords were strange great unwieldy Things,
and they must be very strong Men that used them: Most of those
Men that were killed with them, had their Heads mashed to pieces,
as we may say, or as we call it in English, their Brains knocked out,
and several their Arms and Legs broken; so that it is evident they
fight with inexpressible Rage and Fury. We found not one wounded
Man that was not stone dead; for either they stay by their Enemy
till they have quite killed him, or they carry all the wounded Men,
that are not quite dead, away with them.
This Deliverance tamed our Englishmen for a great while; the
Sight had filled them with Horror, and the Consequences appear'd
terrible to the last Degree, even to them, if ever they should fall into
the Hands of those Creatures, who would not only kill them as Ene-
mies, but kill them for Food, as we kill our Cattle. And they pro-
fess'd to me, that the Thoughts of being eaten up like Beef or Mut-
ton, though it was suppos'd it was not to be till they were dead, had
something in it so horrible, that it nauseated their very Stomachs,
made them sick when they thought of it, and filled their Minds with
such unusual Terror, that they were not themselves for some Weeks
after.
This, as I said, tamed even the three English Brutes I have been
speaking of; and for a great while after they were very tractable, and
went about the common Business of their whole Society well enough;
planted, sowed, reaped, and began to be all naturaliz'd to the Coun-
try. But sometime after this, they fell all into such Measures which
brought them into a great deal of Trouble.
They had taken three Prisoners, as I had observ'd, and these
three being lusty stout young Fellows, they made them Servants, and
taught them to work for them; and, as Slaves, they did well enough;
but they did not take their Measures with them as I did by my Man
Friday, viz. to begin with them upon the Principle of having saved
their Lives, and then instruct them in the rational Principles of Life,
much less of Religion, civilizing and reducing them by kind Usage and
affectionate Arguings; but as they gave them their Food every Day,
so they gave them their Work too, and kept them fully employ'd in
Drudgery enough; but they failed in this, by it, that they never had
them to assist them and fight for them, as I had my Man Friday, who
was as true to me as the very Flesh upon my Bones.
But to come to the Family Part, being all now good Friends; for
common Danger, as I said above, had effectually reconcil'd them,
they began to consider their general Circumstances; and the first
Thing that came under their Consideration was, Whether, seeing the
Savages particularly haunted that Side of the Island, and that there
were more remote and retir'd Parts of it equally adapted to their
Way of Living, and manifestly to their Advantage, they should not
rather remove their Habitation, and plant in some more proper Place
for their Safety, and especially for the Security of their Cattle and
Corn?
Upon this, after long Debate, it was concluded, That they would
not remove their Habitation; because, that sometime or other they
thought they might hear from their Governor again, meaning r^e; and
if I should send any one to seek them, I should be sure to direct them
to that Side, where, if they should find the Place demolish'd, they
would conclude the Savages had killed us all, and we were gone and
so our Sapply would go too.
But as to their Corn and Cattle, they agreed to remove them into
the Valley where my Cave was, where the Land was as proper foi
both, and where indeed there was Land enough: However, upon
second Thought, they alter'd one Part of that Resolution too, and
resolv'd only to remove Part of their Cattle thither, and plant Part of
their Corn there; and so if one Part was destroy'd the other might
be saved: And one Part of Prudence they used, which it was very
well they did, viz. That they never trusted those three Savages, which
they had Prisoners, with knowing anything of the Plantation they had
made in that Valley, or of any Cattle they had there; much less of
the Cave there, which they kept, in Case of Necessity, as a safe
Retreat, and whither they carry'd also the two Barrels of Powder,
which I had sent them at my coming away.
But however they resolv'd not to change their Habitation, yet
they agreed, that as I had carefully cover'd it first with a Wall or
Fortification, and then with a Grove of Trees; so, seeing their Safety
consisted entirely in their being conceal'd, of which they were now
fully convinc'd; they set to Work to cover and conceal the Place yet
more effectually than before: To this Purpose, as I had planted
Trees, (or rather thrust in Stakes, which in Time all grew up to be
Trees) for some good Distance before the Entrance into my Apart-
ment, they went on in the same Manner, and filled up the rest of
that whole Space of Ground, from the Trees I had set, quite down to
the Side of the Creek, where, as I said, I landed my Floats, and even
into the very Ooze where the Tide flowed, not so much as leaving any
Place to land, or any Sign that there had been any Landing there-
about: These Stakes also, being of a Wood very forward to grow, as
I have noted formerly, they took Care to have generally very much
larger and taller than those which I had planted; and as they grew
apace, so they planted them so very thick and close together, that
when they had been three or four Years grown, there was no piercing
with the Eye any considerable Way into the Plantation. And as for
that Part which I had planted, the Trees were grown as thick as a
Man's Thigh; and among them they placed so many other short
ones, and so thick, that, in a Word, it stood like a Pallisado, a
quarter of a Mile thick, and it was next to impossible to penetrate it,
but with a little Army to cut it all down; for a little Dog could
hardly get between the Trees, they stood so close.
But this was not all; for they did the same by all the Ground to the
right Hand, and to the Left, and round even to the Top of the Hill;
leaving no Way, not so much as for themselves to come out, but by
the Ladder placed up to the Side of the Hill, and then lifted up, and
placed again from the first Stage up to the Top; which Ladder,
when it was taken down, nothing but what had Wings or Witchcraft
to assist it, could come at them.
This was excellently well contriv'd : Nor was it less than what they
afterwards found Occasion for; which served to convince me, that aa
human Prudence has the Authority of Providence to justify it, so it
has, doubtless, the Direction of Providence to set it to Work; and
would we listen carefully to the Voice of it, I am fully persuaded we
might prevent many of the Disasters which our Lives are now, by our
Negligence, subjected to. But this by the Way.
I return to the Story. They lived two Years after this in perfect
Retirement, and had no more Visits from the Savages: They had,
indeed, an Alarm given them one Morning, which put them into a
great Consternation; for some of the Spaniards being out early one
Morning on the West Side, or rather the End of the Island, which, by
the Way, was that End where I never went, for fear of being discover'd,
they were surpris'd with seeing above twenty Canoes of Indians, just
coming on Shore.
They made the best of their Way Home, in Hurry enough; ana,
giving the Alarm to their Comrades, they kept close all that Day and
the next, going out only at Night, to make Observation: But they
had the good Luck to be mistaken; for, wherever the Savages went,
they did not land at that Time on the Island, but pursued som<; other
Design.
And now they had another Broil with the three Englishmen; one
of which, a most turbulent Fellow, being in a Rage at one of the three
Slaves, which I mention'd they had taken, because the Fellow
had not done something right which he bid him do, and seemed a
little intractable in his showing him, drew a Hatchet out of a Frog
Belt in which he wore it by his Side, and fell upon the poor Savage,
not to correct him, but to kill him. One of the Spaniards, who was
by, seeing him give the Fellow a barbarous Cut with the Hatchet,
which he aimed at his Head, but struck into his Shoulder, so that he
thought he had cut the poor Creature's Arm off, ran to him, and en-
treating him not to murder the poor Man, clapt in between him and
the Savage, to prevent the Mischief.
The Fellow being enrag'd the more at this, struck at the Spaniard
with his Hatchet, and swore he would serve him as he intended to
serve the Savage; which the Spaniard perceiving, avoided the Blow;
and with a Shovel which he had in his Hand, (for they were all
working in the Field about their Corn-Land) knocked the Brute
down: Another of the Englishmen running at the same Time to help
his Comrade, knocked the Spaniard down; and then two Spaniards
more came in to help their Man, and a third Englishman fell in upon
I! B
them. They had none of them any Firearms, or any other Weapons
but Hatchets and other Tools, except this third Englishman; he had
one of my old rusty Cutlasses, with which he made at the two last
Spaniards, and wounded them both. This Fray set the whole
Family in an Uproar, and more Help coming in, they took the three
Englishmen Prisoners. The next Question was, What should be
done with them, they had been so often mutinous, and were so
furious, so desperate, and so idle withal, that they knew not what
Course to take with them; for they were mischievous to the highest
Degree, and valued not what Hurt they did to any man; so that, in
short, it was not safe to live with them.
The Spaniard, who was Governor, told them in so many Words,
That if they had been of his own Country, he would have hanged
them; for all Laws and all Governors were to preserve Society; and
those who were dangerous to the Society, ought to be expell'd out of
it; but as they were Englishmen, and that it was to the generous
kindness of an Englishman that they all owed their Preservation and
Deliverance, he would use them with all possible Lenity, and would
leave them to the Judgment of the other two Englishmen, who were
their Countrymen.
One of the two honest Englishmen stood up, and said, they desir'd it
might not be left to them; for, says he, I am sure we ought to sentence
them to the Gallows; and with that gives an Account how Will. Atkins,
one of the three, had proposed to have all the five Englishmen join
together, and muriier all the Spaniards when they were in their Sleep.
When the Spanish Governor heard this, he calls to William Atkins,
How, Seignior Atkins, says he, would you murder us all? What have
you to say to that? That harden'd Villain was so far from denying it,
that he said it was true, and G—d d—m him they would do it
still before they had done with them. Well, but Seignior Atkins,
says the Spaniard, What have we done to you, that you would kill us?
And what would you get by killing us? And what must we do to pre-
vent your killing us? Must we kill you, or you will kill us? Why will
you put us to the Necessity of this, Seignior Atkins ? says the Spaniard
very calmly and smiling.
Seignior Atkins was in such a Rage at the Spaniard's making a Jest
of it, that had he not been held by three Men, and withal had no
Weapons with him, it was thought he would have attempted to have
killed the Spaniard in the Middle of all the Company.
This hairbrain'd Carnage oblig'd them to consider seriously what was
to be done. The two Englishmen and the Spaniard who saved the
poor Savage, was of the Opinion, they should hang one of the three
for an Example to the rest, and that, particularly, it should be he that
had twice attempted to commit Murder with his Hatchet: and indeed
there was some Reason to believe he had done it, for the poor Savage
was in such a miserable Condition with the Wound he had receiv'd,
that it was thought he could not live.
But the Governor Spaniard still said No, it was an Englishman
that had saved all their Lives, and he would never consent to put an
Englishman to Death, though he had murder'd half of them, nay,
he said, if he had been killed himself by an Englishman, and had
Time left to speak, it should be, that they should pardon him.
This was so positively insisted on by the Governor Spaniard, that
there was no gainsaying it; and as merciful Councils are most apt to
prevail where they are so earnestly pressed, so they all came into it;
but then it was to be consider'd, what should be done to keep them
from doing the Mischief they design'd; for all agreed, Governor and
all, that Means were to be used for preserving the Society from Dan-
ger; after a long Debate it was agreed, First, That they should be
disarm'd, and not permitted to have either Gun, or Powder, or Shot,
or Sword, or any Weapon, and should be turned out of the Society,
and left to live where they would, and how they would, by themselves;
but that none of the rest, either Spaniards or English, should con-
verse with them, speak with them, or have anything to do with them;
that they should be forbid to come within a certain Distance of the
Place where the rest dwelt; and that if they offer'd to commit any
Disorder, so as to spoil, burn, kill, or destroy any of the Corn, Plant-
ings, Buildings, Fences, or Cattle belonging to the Society, they
should die without Mercy, and they would shoot them wherever they
could find them.
The Governor, a Man of Great Humanity, musing upon the Sen-
tence, consider'd a little upon it, and turning to the two honest
Englishmen, said, Hold, you must reflect, that it will be long e'er
they can raise Corn and Cattle of their own, and they must not starve:
We must therefore allow them Provisions, so he caused to be added,
That they should have a Proportion of Corn given them to last
them eight Months, and for Seed to sow, by which Time they might
be suppos'd to raise some of their own; that they should have six
Milch-Goats, four He-Goats, and six Kids given them, as well for
present Subsistence, as for a Store; and that they should have Tools
given them for their Work in the Fields; such as, six Hatchets, an
Axe, a Saw, and the like: But they should have none of these Tools,
or Provisions, unless they would swear solemnly, that they would not
hurt or injure any of the Spaniards with them, or of their Fellow
Englishmen.
Thus they dismiss'd them the Society, and turned them out to
shift for themselves. They went away sullen and refractory, as
neither contented to go away, or to stay; but, as there was no Remedy,
they went, pretending to go and choose a Place where they would
settle themselves to plant and live by themselves, and some Provi-
sions were given them, but no Weapons.
About four or five Days after, they came again for Victuals, and
gave the Governor an Account where they had pitched their Tents,
and marked themselves out a Habitation and Plantation; and it was
a very convenient Place indeed, on the remotest Part of the Island,
N.E., much about the Place where I landed in my first Voyage, when
I was driven out to Sea, the Lord knows whither, in my Attempt to
surround the Island.
Here they built themselves two handsome Huts and contriv'd
them, in a Manner, like my first Habitation, being close under the
Side of a Hill, having some Trees growing already on three Sides of it,
so that by planting others it would be very easily cover'd from the
Sight, unless narrowly searched for; they desir^ some dried Goat-
skins for Beds and Covering, which were given them; and upon
giving their Words, that they would not disturb the rest, or injure any
of their Plantations, they gave them Hatchets, and what other Tools
they could spare; some Peas, Barley and Rice, for sowing, and, in a
Word, anything they wanted, but Arms and Ammunition.
They lived in this separate Condition about six Months, and had
gotten in their first Harvest, though the Quantity was but small, the
Parcel of Land they had planted being but little; for indeed, having
all their Plantation to form, they had a great deal of Work upon their
Hands; and when they came to make Boards, and Pots, and such
Things, they were quite out of their Element, and could make
nothing of it; and when the rainy Season came on, for want of a Cavt
in the Earth, they could not keep their Grain dry, and it was in grea4.
Danger of spoiling: And this humbled them much - so they came
and begged the Spaniards to help them, which they very readily did,
and in four Days worked a great Hole in the Side of the Hill for them,
big enough to secure their Corn, and other Things from the Rain;
but it was but a poor Place, at best, compar'd to mine; and especially
as mine was then, for the Spaniards had greatly enlarge it, and made
several new Apartments in it
About three Quarters of a Year after this Separation, a new Frolic
took these Rogues, which, together with the former Villainy they had
committed, brought Mischief enough upon them, and had very near
been the Ruin of the whole Colony: The three new Sociates began,
it seems, to be weary of the laborious Life they led, and that without
Hope of bettering their Circumstances ; and a Whim took them, that
they would make a Voyage to the Continent from whence the Savages
came, and would try if they could not seize upon some Prisoners
among the Natives there, and bring them Home, so to make them do
the laborious Part of their Work for them.
The Project was not so preposterous, if they had gone no farther; but
they did nothing, and propos'd nothing, but had either Mischief in
the Design, or Mischief in the Event: And if I may give my Opinion,
they seemed to be under a Blast from Heaven; for if we will not
allow a visible Curse to pursue visible Crimes, how shall we reconcile
the Events of Things with the Divine Justice? It was certainly an
apparent Vengeance on their Crime of Mutiny and Piracy, that
brought them to the State they were in; and as they showed not the
least Remorse for the Crime, but added new Villanies to it, such as,
particularly, the Piece of monstrous Cruelty of wounding a poor Slave,
because he did not, or perhaps could not, understand to do what he
was directed; and to wound him in such a Manner, as, no Question,
made him a Cripple all his Life; and in a Place where no Surgeon or
Medicine could be had for his Cure; and what was still worse, the
murderous Intent, or, to do Justice to the Crime, the intentional
Murder, for such to be sure it was, as was afterwards the formed
Design they all laid, to murder the Spaniards in cold Blood, and in
their Sleep.
But I leave observing, and return to the Story: The three Fel-
lows came down to the Spaniards one Morning, and in very humble
Terms desir'd to be admitted to Speak with them: The Spaniards
very readily heard what they had to say, which was this, That they were
tired of living in the Manner they did; that they were not handy
ADVENTURES OF
enough to make the Necessaries they wanted; and that having no
Help, they found they should be starved: But if the Spaniards would
give them Leave to take one of the Canoes which they came over
in, and give them Arms and Ammunition, proportion'd for their De
fence, they would go over to the Main, and seek their Fortune, anc
so deliver them from the Trouble of supplying them with any other Pro-
visions.
The Spaniards were glad enough to be rid of them, but yet very
honestly represented to them the certain Destruction they were run-
ning into; told them they had suffer'd such Hardships upon that
very Spot, that they could, without any Spirit of Prophesy, tell them
that they would be starved, or be murder'd, and bade them consider
of it
The Men reply'd audaciously, they should be starved if they stayed
here, for they could not work, and would not work; and they could
but be starved Abroad, and if they were murder'd, there was an End
of them, they had no Wives or Children to cry after them; and in
short, insisted importunately upon their Demand, declaring that they
would go, whether they would give them any Arms or no.
The Spaniards
told them, with great
Kindness, that if
they were resolv'd
to go, they should
not go like naked
Men, and be in no
Condition to defend
themselves; and that
though they could
ill spare their Fire-
arms, having not
enough for them-
selves, yet they
would let them have
two Muskets, a Pistol, and a Cutlass, and each Man a Hatchet, which
they thought was sufficient for them.
In a Word, they accepted the Offer, and having baked them Bread
enough to serve them a Month, and given them as much Goats-Flesh
as they could eat while it was sweet, and a great Basket full of dried

Grapes, a Pot full of fresh Water, and a young Kid alive to kill, they
boldly set out in a Canoe for a Voyage over the Sea, where it was
at least 40 Miles broad.
The Boat was indeed a large one, and would have very well carry'd
fifteen or twenty Men; and, therefore, was rather too big lor them to
manage: But as they had a fair Breeze, and the Flood-Tide with
them, they did well enough: They had made a Mast of a long Pole,
and a Sail of four large Goat-Skins dried, which they had sewed or
laced together; and away they went merrily enough; the Spaniards
called after them, Bon Veyajo; and no Man ever thought of seeing
them any more.
The Spaniards would often say to one another, and to the two
honest Englishmen who remain'd behind, how quietly and comfortably
they lived now those three turbulent Fellows were gone; as for their
ever coming again, that was the remotest Thing from their Thoughts
that could be imagin'd; when behold, after two-and-twenty Days'
Absence, one of the Englishmen being abroad upon his Planting-
Work, sees three strange Men coming towards him at a Distance,
with Guns upon their Shoulders.
Away runs the Englishman, as if he was bewitch'd, comes frighted
and amaz'd to the Governor Spaniard, and tells him they were all un-
done, for there were Strangers landed upon the Island, he could not
tell who: The Spaniard, pausing awhile, says to him, How do you
mean, you cannot tell who? They are the Savages to be sure. No,
no, says the Englishman, they are Men in Clothes with Arms: Nay,
then, says the Spaniard, Why are you concern'd? If they are not
Savages they must be Friends, for there is no Christian Nation upon
Earth but will not do us Good rather than Harm.
While they were debating thus, comes the three Englishmen, and
standing without the Wood, which was new planted, hallow'd to them;
they presently knew their Voices, and so all the Wonder of that kind
ceased. But now the Admiration was turned upon another Question,
(viz.) what could be the Matter, and what made them come back
again?
It was not long before they brought the Men in, and inquiring
where they had been, and what they had been doing, they gave them
a full Account of their Voyage in a few Words, (viz.) That they
reached the Land in two Days, or something less, but finding the
People alarm'd at their coming, and preparing with Bows and Arrows
to fight them, they durst not go on Shore, but sailed on to the
Northward six or seven Hours, till they came to a gTeat Opening, by
which they perceiv'd that the Land they saw from our Island was not
the Main, but an Island; that entering that Opening of the Sea,
they saw another Island on the Right-Hand North, and several more
West; and being resolv'd to land somewhere, they put over to one of
the Islands which lay West, and went boldly on Shore; that they
found the People very courteous and friendly to them, and that they
gave them several Roots and some dried Fish, and appear'd very
sociable; and the Women, as well as the Men, were very forward to
supply them with anything they could get for them to eat, and brought
it to them a great Way upon their Heads.
They continu'd here four Days, and inquir'd as well as they could
of them by Signs, what Nations were this Way and that Way; and
were told of several fierce and terrible People that lived almost every
Way, who, as they made signs to them, used to eat Men. But as for
themselves, they said, that they never eat Men or Women, except only
such as they took in the Wars, and then they owned that they made
a great Feast, and eat their Prisoners.
The Englishmen inquir'd when they had a Feast of that Kind,
and they told them about two Moons ago, pointing to the Moon, and
then to two Fingers; and that their great King had two hundred
Prisoners now, which he had taken in his War; and they were feed-
ing them to make them fat for the next Feast The Englishmen
seemed mighty desirous to see those Prisoners, but the other mis-
taking them, thought they were desirous to have some of them to
carry away for their own eating. So they beckon'd to them, pointing
to the setting of the Sun, and then to the rising, which was to signify,
that the next Morning at Sunrising they would bring some for them;
and accordingly the next Morning they brought down five Women
and eleven Men, and gave them to the Englishmen, to carry with
them on their Voyage, just as we would bring so many Cows and
Oxen down to a Seaport Town, to victual a Ship.
As brutish and barbarous as these Fellows were at Home, their
Stomachs turned at this Sight, and they did not know what to do;
to refuse the Prisoners, would have been the highest Affront to the
Savage Gentry that offer'd them; and what to do with them they
knew not; however, upon some Debates, they resolv'd to accept of
them, and in Return they gave the Savage? that brought them one
of their Hatchets, an old Key, a Knife, and six or seven of their
Bullets, which, though they did not understand, they seemed extremely
pleased with: And then tying the poor Creatures' Hands behind
them, they (the People) dragged the poor Prisoners into the Boat
for our Men.
The Englishmen were oblig'd to come away as soon as they had
them, or else they that gave them this noble Present would certainly
have expected that they should have gone to work with them, have
killed two or three of them the next Morning, and perhaps have in-
vited the Donors to Dinner.
But having taken their Leave with all the Respects and Thanks
that could well pass between People, where on either Side they un-
derstood not one Word they could say, they put off with their Boat,
and came back towards the first Island, where, when they arriv'd,
they set eight of their Prisoners at Liberty, there being too many of
them for their Occasion.
In their Voyage, they endeavour'd to have some Communication
with their Prisoners, but it was impossible to make them understand
anything; nothing they could say to them, or give them, or do for
them, but was looked upon as going about to murder them. They
first of all unbound them, but the poor Creatures screamed at that,
especially the Women, as if they had just felt the Knife at their
Throats; for they immediately concluded they were unbound on
purpose to be killed.
If they gave them anything to eat, it was the same Thing; then
they concluded it was for fear they should sink in Flesh, and so not
be fat enough to kill. If they looked at one of them more particularly,
the Party presently concluded, it was to see whether he or she was
fattest and fittest to kill. Nay, after they had brought them quite
over, and began to use them kindly, and treat them well, still they
expected every Day to make a Dinner or a Supper for their new
Masters.
When the three Wanderers had given this unaccountable History
or Journal of their Voyage, the Spaniard asked them, Where their new
Family was? and being told that they had brought them on Shore,
and put them into one of their Huts, and were come up to beg some
Victuals for them; they (the Spaniards) and the other two Englishmen,
that is to say, the whole Colony, resolv'd to go all down to the Place
and see them, and did so, and Friday's Father with them.
ADVENTURES OF
When they came into the Hut, there they sat all bound; for when
they had brought them on Shore, they bound their Hands that they
might not take the Boat and make their Escape. There, I say, they
sat, all of them stark naked. First, There were three Men, lusty
comely Fellows, well shaped, straight and fair Limbs, about thirty to
thirty-five Years of Age; and five Women, whereof two might be from
thirty to forty, two more not above four or five-and-twenty, and the
fifth, a tall comely Maiden about sixteen or seventeen: The Women
were well favour'd agreeable Persons both in Shape and Features,
only tawny, and two of them, had they been perfect White, would
have passed for very handsome Women even in London itself, having
pleasant agreeable Countenances and of a very modest Behaviour,
especially when they came afterwards to be clothed, and dressed, as
they called it, though the Dress was very indifferent it must be con-
fess'd; of which hereafter.
The Sight, you may be sure, was something uncouth to our Spaniards,
who were (to give them a just Character) Men of the best Behaviour,
of the most calm, sedate Tempers, and perfect Good humour that
ever I met with, and in particular, of the most Modesty, as will pre-
sently appear: I say, the Sight was very uncouth, to see two naked
Men and five naked Women, all together bound, and in the most
miserable Circumstances that Human Nature could be suppos'd to be,
(viz.) to be expecting every Moment to be dragged out, and have
their Brains knocked out, and then to be eaten up like a Calf that is
killed for a Dainty.
The first Thing they did, was to cause the old Indian, Friday's
Father, to go in and see first if he knew any of them, and then if he
understood any of their Speech: As soon as the old Man came in,
he looked seriously at them, but knew none of them; neither could
any of them understand a Word he said, or a Sign he could make,
except one of the Women.
However, this was enough to answer the End, which was to satisfy
them, that the Men into whose Hands they were fallen, were Christians;
that they abhorr'd eating of Men or Women, and that they might be
sure they would not be killed: As soon as they were assur'd of this,
they discover'd such a Joy, and by such awkward, and several Ways,
as is hard to describe; for it seems they were of several Nations.
The Woman, who was their Interpreter, was bid in the next Place
to ask them, if they were willing to be Servants, and to work tor the
Men who had brought them away, to save their Lives; at which they
all fell a Dancing; and presently one fell to taking up this, and
another that, anything that lay next, to carry on their Shoulders,
to intimate that they were willing to work.
The Governor, who found, that the having Women among them
would presently be attended with some Inconvenience, and might
occasion some Strife, and perhaps Blood; asked the three Men, what
they intended to do with these Women, and how they intended to
use them; whether as Servants, or as Women? One of the Englishmen
answer'd very boldly and readily, That they would use them as both.
To which the Governor said, I am not going to restrain you from it,
you are your own Masters as to that: But this I think is but just, for
avoiding Disorders and Quarrels among you; and I desire it of you,
for that Reason only, viz. That you will all engage, that if any of you
take any of these Women, as a Woman or Wife, that he shall take
but one; and that having taken one, none else should touch her; for
though we cannot marry any of you, yet it is but reasonable, that while
you stay here, the Woman any of you takes, should be maintain'd by
the Man that takes her, and should be his Wife; I mean, says he,
while he continues here, and that none else shall have anything to do
with her: All this appear'd so just, that every one agreed to it with-
out any Difficulty.
Then the Englishmen asked the Spaniards, if they design'd to take
any of them? But every one of them answer'd, NO: Some of them
said, they had Wives in Spain, and the others did not like Women
that were not Christians; and all together declar'd, that they would
not touch one of them; which was an Instance of such Virtue, as I
have not met with in all my Travels. On the other Hand, to be short,
the five Englishmen took them every one a Wife, that is to say, a
temporary Wife; and so they set up a new Form of Living; for the
Span 'ards and Friday's Father lived in my old Habitation, which they
had enlarg'd exceedingly within. The three Servants which were
taken in the late Battle of the Savages, lived with them; and these
carry" d on the main Part of the Colony, supplying all the rest with
Food, and assisting them in anything as they could, or as they found
Necessity requir'd.
But the Wonder of this Story was, how five such refractory ill-
match'd Fellows should agree about these Women, and that two of
tnem should not pitch upon the same Woman, especially seeing two
or thi^e of them were, without Comparison, more agreeable than the
other: But they took a good Way enough to prevent quarrelling
imong themselves; for they set the five Women by themselves in one
nf their Huts, and they went all into the other Hut, and drew Lots
among them, who should choose first
He that drew to choose first, went away by himself to the Hut
where the poor naked Creatures were, and fetched out her he chose;
and it was worth observing, that he that chose first took her that was
reckon'd the homeliest, and the oldest of the five, which made Mirth
enough among the rest; and even the Spaniards laughed at it: But
the Fellow consider'd better than any of them, that it was Application
and Business that they were to expect Assistance in, as much as any-
thing else; and she proved the best Wife of all the Parcel.
When the poor Women saw themselves set in a Row thus, and
fetched out one by one, the Terrors of their Condition return'd upon
them again, and they firmly believ'd that they were now agoing to be
devour'd; accordingly, when the English Sailor came in and fetched
out one of them, the rest set up a most lamentable Cry, and hung
about her, and took their Leave of her with such Agonies and such
Affection, as would have grieved the hardest Heart in the World; nor
was it possible for the Englishmen to satisfy them, that they were not
to be immediately murdered, till tney fetched the old Man, Friday's
Father, who immediately let them know that the five Men, who had
fetched them out one by one, had chosen them for their Wives.
When they had done, and the Fright the Women were in was a
little over, the Men went to Work, and the Spaniards came and
helped them: and in a few Hours they had built them every one 9
new Hut, or Tent for their Lodging apart; for those they had already,
were crowded with their Tools, Household-Stuff, and Provision. The
three wicked Ones had pitched farthest off, and the two honest Ones
nearer, but both on the North Shore of the Island, so that they con-
tinu'd separate as before: And thus my Island was peopled in three
Places; and, as I might say, three Towns were begun to be planted.
And here it is very well worth observing, That as it often happens
in the World (what the wise Ends of God's Providence are in such a
Disposition of Things, I cannot say) the two honest Fellows had the
two worst Wives, and the three Reprobates, that were scarce worth
hanging, that were fit for nothing, and neither seemed bor n to do
themselves Good, or any one else, had three clever, diligent, carefc/
and ingenious Wives; not that the two first were ill Wives, as to theii
Temper or Humour; for all the five were most willing, quiet, passive.
and subjected Creatures, rather like Slaves than Wives; but my
Meaning is, they were not alike capable, ingenious, or industrious, or
alike cleanly and neat
Another Observation I must make, to the Honour of a diligent
Application on one Hand, and to the Disgrace of a slothful, negligent,
idle Temper, on the other, that when I came to the Place, and view'd
the several Improvements, Plantings, and Management of the several
little Colonies, the two Men had so far outgone the three, that there
was no Comparison. They had indeed both of them as much Ground
laid out for Corn as they wanted; and the Reason was, because, ac-
cording to my Rule, Nature dictated that it was to no Purpose to
sow more Corn than they wanted, but the Difference of the Cultiva-
tion, of the Planting, of the Fences, and indeed of everything else,
was easy to be seen at first View.
The two Men had innumerable young T/ees planted about their
Huts, that when you came to the Place, nothing was to be seen but a
Wood, and though they had twice had their Plantation demolish'd,
once by their own Countrymen, and once by the Enemy, as shall be
shown in its Place; yet they had restor'd all again, and everything
was thriving and flourishing about them; they had Grapes planted in
Order, and manag'd like a Vineyard, though they had themselves
never seen anything of that Kind; and by their good ordering their
Vines, their Grapes were as good again as any of the others. They
had also found themselves out a Retreat in the thickest Part of the
Woods, where, though there was not a natural Cave, as I had found,
yet they made one with incessant Labour of their Hands, and where
when the Mischief which follow'd happen'd, they secur'd their AVives
and Children, so as they could never be found; they having by stick-
ing innumerable Stakes and Poles of the Wood, which, as I said,
grew so easily, made the Wood unpassable, except in some Places,
where they climbed up to get over the outside Part, and then went on
by Ways of their own leaving.
As to the three Reprobates, as I justly call them, though they were
much civiliz'd by their new Settlement, compar'd to what they
were before, and were not so quarrelsome, having not the same Op-
portunity; yet one of the certain Companions of a profligate Mind
never left them, and that was their Idleness. It is true, they planted
Corn, and made Fences; but Solomon's Words were never better veri-
ryd than in them: I went by the Vineyard of the Slothful, and it wot
all overgrown with Thorns; for when the Spaniards came to view
their Crop, they could not see it in some Places for Weeds; the
Hedge had several Gaps in it, where the wild Goats had gotten in.
and eaten up the Corn; perhaps, here and there, a dead Bush was
crammed in, to stop them out for the Present, but it was only shutting
the Stable door after the Steed was stolen. Whereas, when they
looked on the Colony of the other two, there was the very Face of
Industry and Success upon all they did; there was not a Weed to be
seen in all their Corn, or a Gap in any of their Hedges: And they,
on the other Hand, verify'd Solomon's Words in another Place, That
the diligent Hand makes rich; for everything grew and thrived, and
they had Plenty within and without; they had more tame Cattle than
the other, more Utensils and Necessaries within Doors, and yet more
Pleasure and Diversion too.
It is true, the Wives of the three were very handy and cleanly
within Doors, and having learned the English Ways of Dressing and
Cooking from one of the other Englishmen, who, as I said, was Cook's-
mate on board the Ship, they dressed their Husbands' Victuals very
nicely and well; whereas the other could not be brought to under-
stand it; but then the Husband, who, as I say, had been Cook's-
mate, did it himself; but as for the Husbands of the three Wives,
they loiter'd about, fetched Turtles' Eggs, and caught Fish and Birds;
in a Word, anything but Labour, and they fared accordingly. The
Diligent lived well and comfortably, and the Slothful lived hard and
beggarly; and so I believe, generally speaking, it is all over the
World.
But now I come to a Scene, different from all that had happen'd
before, either to them, or to me; and the Original of the Story was
this:
Early one Morning there came on Shore five or six Canoes of In-
dians, or Savages, call them which you please; and there is no Room
to doubt that they came upon the old Errand of feeding upon their
Slaves: But that Part was now so familiar to the Spaniards, and to
our Men too, that they did not concern themselves about it, as I did;
but having been made sensible by their Experience, that their only
Business was to lie conceal'd, and that if they were not seen by any
of the Savages, they would go off again quietly when their Business
was done, having as yet not the least Notion of there Wing any Inha-
bitants in the Island; I say, having been made sensible of this, they
had nothing to do but to give Notice to all the three Plantations, to
keep within Doors, and not show themselves, only placing a Scout in
a proper Place, to give Notice when the Boats went to Sea again.
This was without doubt very right; but a Disaster spoilt all these
Measures, and made it known among the Savages, that there were
Inhabitants there, which was in the End the Desolation of almost the
whole Colony; after the Canoes with the Savages were gone off, the
Spaniards peeped abroad again, and some of them had the Curiosity
to go to the Place where they had been, to see what they had been
doing: Here, to their great Surprise, they found three Savages left
behind, and lying fast asleep upon the Ground; it was suppos'd, they
had either been so gorged with their inhuman Feast, that, like Beasts,
they were asleep, and would not stir when the others went, or they
were wander'd into the Woods, and did not come back in time to be
taken in.
The Spaniards were greatly surpris'd at this Sight, and perfectly at
a Loss what to do; the Spaniard Governor, as it happen'd, was with
them, and his Advice was asked, but he profess'd he knew not what
to do; as for Slaves, they had enough already, and as to killing
them, they were none of them inclin'd to that; the Spaniard
Governor told me, they could not think of shedding innocent Blood,
for as to them, the poor Creatures had done them no Wrong, in-
vaded none of their Property, and they thought they had no just
Quarrel against them, to take away their Lives.
And here I must, in Justice to these Spaniards, observe, that let
the Accounts of Spanish Cruelty in Mexico and Peru be what they
will, I never met with seventeen Men of any Nation whatsoever, in
any foreign Country, who were so universally Modest, Temperate,
Virtuous, so very Good-humour'd, and so Courteous as these Spa-
niards; and as to Cruelty, they had nothing of it in their very
Nature, no Inhumanity, no Barbarity, no outrageous Passions, and
yet all of them Men of great Courage and Spirit
Their Temper and Calmness had appear'd in their bearing the un-
sufferable Usage of the three Englishmen; and their Justice and
Humanity appear'd now in the Case of the Savages, as above. After
some Consultation, they resolv'd upon this, that they would lie still a
while longer, till, if possible, these three Men might be gone; but
then the Governor Spaniard recollected, that the three Savages had
no Boat, and that if they were left to rove about the Island, they
would certainly discover that there were Inhabitants in it, and so
they should be undone that Way.
Upon this, they went back again, and there lay the Fellows fast
asleep still, so they resolv'd to waken them, and take them Prisoners,
and they did so; the poor Fellows were strangely frighted when
they were seized upon and bound, and afraid, like the Women, that
they should be murder'd and eaten; for it seems those People
think all the World does as they do, eating Men's Flesh; but
they were soon made easy as to that, and away they carry'd
them.
It was very happy to them that they did not carry them Home
to their Castle, I mean to my Palace under the Hill; but they
carry'd them first to the Bower, where was the chief of their Coun-
try-work, such as the keeping the Goats, the planting the Corn, cW.,
and aftenvards, they carry'd them to the Habitation of the two Eng-
lishmen.
Here they were set to work, though it was not much they had for
them to do; and whether it was by Negligence in guarding them, or
that they thought the Fellows could not mend themselves, I know
not, but one of th«m run away, and taking into the Woods, they could
never hear of him more.
They had good Reason to believe he got Home again soon after,
in some other Boats or Canoes of Savages, who came on Shore three
or four Weeks afterwards, and who, carrying on their Revels as usual,
went off again in two Days' time: This Thought terrify'd them ex-
ceedingly; for they concluded, and that not without good Cause
indeed, that if this Fellow came safe Home among his Comrades, he
would certainly give them an Account, that there were People in the
Island, as also how few and weak they were; for this Savage, as I
observ'd before, had never been told, and it was very happy he had
not, how many they were, or where they lived; nor had he ever seen
or heard the Fire of any of their Guns, much less had they shown
him any of their other retir'd Places; such as the Cave in the Valley,
or the new Retreat which the two Englishmen had made, and
the like.
The first Testimony they had that this Fellow had given Intelli-
gence of them, was, that about two Months after this, six Canoes of
Savages, with about seven, or eight, or ten Men in a Canoe, came
rowing along the North Side of the Island, where they never used to
come before, and landed about an Hour after Sunrise, at a conve-
nient Place, about a Mile from the Habitation of the two Englishmen
where this escap'd Man had been kept: As the Spaniard Governor
said, had they been all there, the Damage would not have been so
much, for not a Man of them would have escap'd; but the Case
differ'd now very much, for two Men to fifty was too much odds:
The two Men had the Happiness to discover them about a League
off, so that it was above an Hour before they landed, and as they
landed a Mile from their Huts, it was some time before they could
come at them: Now having great Reason to believe that they were
betray'd, the first Thing they did, was to bind the two Slaves which
were left, and cause two of the three Men, whom they brought with
the Women, who it seems proved very faithful to them, to lead them
with their two Wives, and whatever they could carry away with them,
to their retir'd Place in the Woods, which I have spoken of above,
and there to bind the two Fellows Hand and Foot till they heard
farther.
In the next Place, seeing the Savages were all come on Shore,
and that they bent their Course directly that Way, they opened the
I'ences where their Milch-Goats were kept, and drove them all out,
leaving their Goats to straggle into the Wood, whither they pleased,
that the Savages might think they were all bred wild; but the
Rogue who came with them was too cunning for that, and gave them
an Account of it all; for they went directly to the Place.
When the two poor frighted Men had secur'd their Wives and
Goods, they sent the other Slave they had of the three, who came
with the Women, and who was at their Place by Accident, away
to the Spaniard, with all Speed, to give them the Alarm, and de-
sire speedy Help; and in the meantime they took their Arms,
and what Ammunition they had, and retreated towards the Place
in the Wood, where their Wives were sent, keeping at a Distance,
yet so that they might see, if possible, which Way the Savages
took.
They had not gone far, but that, from a rising Ground, they
could see the little Army of their Enemies come on directly to
their Habitation, and in a Moment more could see all their Huts
and Household - Stuff flaming up together, to their great Grief
and Mortification; for they had a very great Loss, to them irre-
trievable, at least for some Time. They kept their Station for a
while, till they found the Savages, like wild Beasts, spread them-
selves all over the Place, rummaging every Way and every Place
they could think of, in Search for Prey, and in particular for the
People, of whom it now plainly appear'd they had Intelligence.
The two Englishmen seeing this, thinking themselves not secure
where they stood, because as it was likely some of the wild People
might come that Way, so they might come too many together,
thought it proper to make another Retreat about half a Mile farther,
believing, as it afterwards happen'd, that the farther they strolled, the
fewer would be together.
The next Halt was at the Entrance into a very thick grown Part of
the Woods, and where an old Trunk of a Tree stood, which was
hollow and vastly large; and in this Tree they both took their Stand-
ing, resolving to see there what might offer.
They had not stood there long, but two of the Savages appear'd
running directly that Way, as if they had already had Notice where
they stood, and were coming up to attack them; and a little Way
farther, they spied three more coming after them, and five more be-
yond them, all coming the same Way; besides which, they saw seven
or eight more at a Distance, running another Way; for in a Word,
they ran every Way like Sportsmen beating for their Game.
The poor Men were now in great Perplexity, whether they should
stand and keep their Posture, or fly: But after a very short Debate
with themselves, they consider'd, that if the Savages rang'd the
Country thus before Help came, they might perhaps find out their
Retreat in the Woods, then all would be lost; so they resolv'd to
Itand them there; and if they were too many to deal with, then
they would get up to the Top of the Tree, from whence they doubted
not to defend themselves, Fire excepted, as long as their Ammunition
lasted, though all the Savages that were landed, which was near fifty,
were to attack them.
Having resolv'd upon this, they next consider'd whether they
should fire at the first two, or wait for the three, and so take the
middle Party, by which the two and the five that follow'd would be
separated; and they resolv'd to let the two first pass by, unless they
should spy them in the Tree, and come to attack them. The tws
first Savages also confirm'd them in this Regulation, by turning a
little from them towards another Part of the Wood; but the three,
and the five after them, came forwards directly to the Tree, as if they
had known the Englishmen were there.
Seeing them come so straight towards them, they resolv'd to take
them in a Line, as they came; and as they resolv'd to fire but one
at a Time, perhaps the first Shot might hit them a!l three, to which
Purpose, the Man who was to fire put three or four Bullets
into his Piece, and having a fair Loop-hole, as it were, from a broken
Hole in the Tree, he took a sure Aim, without being seen, waiting
till they were wiUiin about thirty Yards of the Tree, so that he could
not miss.
While they were thus waiting, and the Savages came on, they
plainly saw that one of the three was the Runaway Savage that had
escap'd from them, and they both knew him distinctly, and resolv'd
that, if possible, he should not escape, though they should both fire;
so the other stood ready with his Piece, that if he did not drop at
the first Shot, he should be sure to have a second.
But the first was too good a Marksman to miss his Aim; for as
the Savages kept near one another, a little behind in a Line, in a
Word, he fired, and hit two of them directly: The foremost was
killed outright, being shot in the Head: The second, which was the
run-away Indian, was shot through the Body, and fell, but was not
quite dead: And the third had a little Scratch in the Shoulder,
perhaps by the same Ball that went through the Body of the second,
and being dreadfully frighted, though not much hurt, sat down
upon the Ground, screaming and yelling in a hideous manner.
The five that were behind, more frighted with the Noise than
sensible of the Danger, stood still at first; for the Woods made the
Sound a thousand Times bigger than it really was; the Echoes
rattling from one Side to another, and the Fowls rising from all Parts,
screaming and making, every Sort, a several Kind of Noise accord-
ing to their Kind, just as it was when I fired the first Gun that
perhaps was ever shot off in that Place since it was an Island.
However, all being silent again, and they not knowing what the
Matter was, came on unconcern'd, till they came to the Place where
their Companions lay in a Condition miserable enough: And here
me poor ignorant Creatures, not sensible that they were within Reach
of the same Mischief, stood all of a Huddle over the wounded Man,
talking, and, as may be suppos'd, inquiring of him, how he came to
be hurt; and who, it is very rational to believe, told them, that a
Flash of Fire first, and immediately after that, Thunder from their
Gods, had killed those two, and wounded him: This, I say, is rational;
for nothing is more certain than that, as they saw no Man near them,
so they had never heard a Gun in all their Lives, or so much as heard
of a Gun; neither knew they anything of killing or wounding, at a
Distance, with Fire and Bullets; if they had, one might reasonably
believe, they would not have stood so unconcern'd, in viewing the
Fate of their Fellows, without some Apprehension of their own.
Our two Men, though as they confess'd to me, it grieved them to
be oblig'd to kill so many poor Creatures, who, at the same Time, had
no Notion of their Danger; yet having them all thus in their Power,
and the first having loaded his Piece again, resolv'd to let fly both
together among them; and singling out, by Agreement, which to aim
at, they shot together, and killed or very much wounded four of
them; the fifth, frighted even to Death, though not hurt, fell with
the rest; so that our Men seeing them all fall together, thought they
had killed them all.
The Belief that the Savages were all killed, made our two Men
come boldly out of the Tree before they had charged their Guns
again, which was a wrong Step; and they were under some Surprise
when they came to the Place, and found no less than four of the
Men alive, and of them two very little hurt, and one not at all: This
oblig'd them to fall upon them with the Stocks of their Muskets; and
first they made sure of the run-away Savage, that had been the
Cause of all the Mischief, and of another that was hurt in his Knee,
and put them out of their Pain; then the Man that was not hurt at
all, came and kneeled down to them, with his two Hands held up,
and made piteous Moans to them by Gestures and Signs, for his
Life; but could not say one Word to them that they could under-
stand.
However, they signed to him to sit down at the Foot of a Tree
thereby; and one of the English>nen, with a Piece of Rope-Twine
which he had, by great Chance, in his Pocket, tied his two Feet fast
together, and his two Hands behind him, and there they left him;
and, with what Speed they could, made after the other two, which
were gone before; fearing they, or any more of them, should find the
Way to their cover'd Place in the Woods, where their Wives, and the
few Goods they had left, lay. They came once in Sight of the two
Men, but it was at a great Distance; however, they had the Satisfac-
tion to see them cross over a Valley towards the Sea, the quite
contrary Way from that which led to their Retreat, which they were
afraid of; and being satisfy'd with that, they went back to the
Tree, where they left their Prisoner, who, as they suppos'd, was
deliver'd by his Comrades; for he was gone, and the two Pieces of
Rope-Yarn, with which they had bound him, lay just at the Foot of
the Tree.
They were now in as great a Concern as before, not knowing what
Course to take, or how near the Enemy might be, or in what
Numbers; so they resolv'd to go away to the Place where their Wives
were, to see if all was well there, and to make them easy, who were
in Fright enough to be sure; for though the Savages were their own
Country Folk, yet they were most terribly afraid of them, and perhaps
the more, for the Knowledge they had of them.
When they came there, they found the Savages had been in the
Wood, and very near that Place, but had not found it; for it was
indeed inaccessible, by the Trees standing so thick, as before, had
not the Persons seeking it been directed by those that knew it, which
these did not; they found therefore everything very safe, only the
Women in a terrible Fright: While they were here, they had the
Comfort to have seven of the Spaniards come to their Assistance;
the other ten, with their Servants, and old Friday, I mean Friday's
Father, were gone in a Body to defend their Bower, and the Corn,
and Cattle that was kept there, in Case the Savages should have
roved over to that Side of the Country; but they did not spread so
far. With the seven Spaniards came one of the three Savages, who,
as I said, were their Prisoners formerly; and with them also came
the Savage, whom the Englishmen had left bound Hand and Foot
at the Tree; for it seems they came that Way, saw the Slaughter of
the seven Men, and unbound the eighth, and brought him along with
them; where, however, they were oblig'd to bind him again, as they
had the two others, who were left when the third run away. -
The Prisoners began now to be a Burden to them; and they were
so afraid of their escaping, that they were once resolving to kill them
all, believing they were under an absolute Necessity to do so, for
their own Preservation: However, the Spaniard Governor would not
consent to it, but order'd for the present that they should be sent
out of the Way to my old Cave in the Valley, and be kept there with
two Spaniards to guard them, and give them Food for their Subsistence,
which was done; and they were bound there Hand and Foot for that
Night
When the Spaniards came, the two Englishmen were so encourag'd
that they could not satisfy themselves to stay any longer there; but
taking five of the Spaniards, and themselves, with four Muskets and
a Pistol among them, and two stout Quarter-Staves, away they went
in Quest of the Savages. And first they came to the Tree where the
Men lay that had been killed; but it was easy to see that some more
of the Savages had been there; for they had attempted to cany their
dead Men away, and had dragged two of them a good Way, but had
given it over. From thence they advanc'd to the first rising Ground,
where they stood, and saw their Camp destroy'd, and where they had
the Mortification still to see some of the Smoke; but neither could they
here see any of the Savages: Then they resolv'd, though with all
possible Caution, to go forward towards their ruin'd Plantation: But
a little before they came thither, coming in Sight of the Sea Shore,
they saw plainly the Savages all embarking again in their Canoes, in
order to be gone.
They seemed sorry at first; and there was no Way to come at
them, to give them a parting Blow: But upon the whole, were very
well satisfy'd to be rid of them.
The poor Englishmen being now twice ruin'd, and all their Im-
provement destroy'd, the rest all agreed to come and help them
rebuild, and to assist them with needful Supplies. Their three
Countrymen, who were not yet noted for having the least Inclination to
do any Good, yet as soon as they heard of it (for they living remote
Eastward, knew nothing of the Matter till all was over) came and
offer'd their Help and Assistance, and did very friendly work for
several Days, to restore their Habitation, and make Necessaries for
them: And thus, in a little Time, they were set upon their Legs
again.
About two Days after this, they had the farther Satisfaction of
seeing three of the Savages' Canoes come driving on Shore, and at
some Distance from them, two drowned Men; by which they had
Reason to believe, that they had met with a Storm at Sea, and had
overset some of them; for it had blown very hard the very Night
after they went off.
However, as some might miscarry, so on the other Hand, enough
of them escap'd to inform the rest, as well of what they had done, as
of what had happen'd to them; and to whet them on to anothei
Enterprise of the same Nature, which they, it seems, resolv'd to
attempt, with sufficient Force to carry all before them; for except
what the first Man had told them of Inhabitants, they could say little
to it of their own Knowledge; for they never saw one Man, and the
Fellow being killed that had affirm'd it, they had no other Witness
to confirm it to them.
It was five or six Months after this before they heard any more of
the Savages; in which Time our Men were in Hopes they had either
forgot their former bad Luck, or given over the Hopes of better;
when on a sudden they were invaded with a most formidable
Fleet, of no less than eight-and-twenty Canoes full of Savages,
armed with Bows and Arrows, great Clubs, wooden Swords,
and such like Engines of War; and they brought such Numbers
with them, that, in short, it put all our People into the utmost
Consternation.
As they came on Shore in the Evening, and at the Easternmost
Side of the Island, our Men had that Night to consult and consider
what to do; and, in the first Place, knowing that their being entirely
conceal'd was their only Safely before, and would much more be so
now, while the Number of their Enemies was so great, they therefore
resolv'd first of all to take down the Huts which were built for the
two Englishmen, and drive away their Goats to the old Cave; because
they suppos'd the Savages would go directly thither, as soon as it was
Day, to play the old Game over again, though they did not now land
within two Leagues of it
In the next Place, they drove away all the Flock of Goats they had
at the old Bower, as I called it, which belong'd to the Spaniards;
and in short, left as little Appearance of Inhabitants anywhere as was
possible; and the next Morning early they posted themselves with
all their Force at the Plantation of the two Men, waiting for their
Coming: As they guessed, so it happen'd; these new Invaders
leaving their Canoes at the East End of the Island, came ranging
along the Shore directly towards the Place, to the Number of two-
hundred-and-fifty, as near as our Men could judge. Our Army was
but small indeed; but that which was worse, they had not Arms for
all their Number neither: The whole Account, it seems, stood thua;
First, as to the men.
:j Spaniards.
$ Englishmen.
i Old Friday, or Friday's Father.
3 The three Slaves taken with the Women, who proved very
faithful.
3 Other Slaves who lived with the Spaniards.
To arm these, they had,
ii Muskets.
5 Pistols.
3 Fowling Pieces.
5 Muskets or Fowling Pieces, which were taken by me from
the mutinous Seamen, whom I reduc'd.
2 Swords, 3 old Halberds.
To their Slaves they did not give either Musket or Fusee, but they
had every one a Halberd, or a long Staff, like a Quarter-Staff, with a
great Spike of Iron fasten'd into each End of it, and by his Side a
Hatchet; also every one of our Men had Hatchets : Two of the Women
could not be prevail'd upon but they would come into the Fight;
and they had Bows and Arrows, which the Spaniards had taken from
the Savages, when the first Action happen'd, which I have spoken of,
where the Indians fought with one another, and the Women
Hatchets too.
The Spaniard Governor, whom I have describ'd so often, commanded
the whole; and William Atkins, who though a dreadful Fellow for
Wickedness, was a most daring bold Fellow, commanded under him.
The Savages came forward like Lions, and our Men, which was the
worst of their Fate, had no Advantage in their Situation; only that
Will Atkins, who now proved a very useful Fellow, with six Men,
was planted just behind a small Thicket of Bushes, as an advanc'd
Guard, with Orders to let the first of them pass by, and then fire into
the Middle of them; and, as soon as he had fired, to make his Retreat
as nimble as he could round a Part of the Wood, and so come in
behind the Spaniards where they stood, having a Thicket of Trees
all before them.
When the Savages came on, they ran straggling about every Way
in Heaps, out of all manner of Order, and W. Atkins let about
349
fifty of them pass by him, then seeing the rest come in a very thick
Throng, he orders three of his Men to fire, having loaded their
Muskets with six or seven Bullets apiece, about as big as large Pistol
Bullets. How many they killed or wounded they knew not, but the
Consternation and Surprise was inexpressible among the Savages;
they were frighted to the last Degree, to hear such a dreadful Noise,
and see their Men killed, and others hurt, but see nobody that did it;
when in the Middle of their Fright, W. Atkins and his other
three let fly again among the thickest of them; and in less than a
Minute the first three, being loaded again, gave them a third
Volley.
Had W. Alkins and his Men retir'd immediately, as soon as they
had fired, as they were order'd to do; or had the rest of the
Body been at Hand to have poured in their Shot continually, the
Savages had been effectually routed; for the Terror that was among
them came principally from this, (viz.) That they were killed by the
Gods with Thunder and Lightning, and could see nobody that hurt
them; but W. Atkins staying to load again, discover'd the Cheat
Some of the Savages who were at a Distance, spying them, came
upon them behind, and though Atkins and his Men fired at them also,
two or three Times, and killed above twenty, retiring as fast as they
could, yet they wounded Atkins himself, and killed one of his Fellow
Englishmen with their Arrows, as they did afterwards one Spaniard,
and one of the Indian Slaves who came with the Women; this
Slave was a most gallant Fellow, and fought most desperately, killing
five of them with his own Hand, having no Weapon, but one of tbr
armed Staves and a Hatchet
Our Men being thus hard laid at, Atkins wounded, and two othei
Men killed, retreated to a rising Ground in the Wood, and the
Spaniards after firing three "Volleys upon them retreated also; for
their Number was so great, and they were so desperate, that though
above fifty of them were killed, and more than so many wounded, yet
they came on in the Teeth of our Men, fearless of Danger, and shot
their Arrows like a Cloud; and it was observ'd that their wounded
Men, who were not quite disabled, were made outrageous by their
Wounds, and fought like Madmen.
When our Men retreated, they left the Spaniard and the English-
man that was killed behind them; and the Savages, when they came
up to them, killed them over again in a wretched Manner, breaking
ADVENTURES OF
the Anns, Legs, and Heads with their Clubs and wooden Swords,
like true Savages: But rinding our Men were gone, they did not seem
to pursue them, but drew themselves up in a kind of a Ring, which
is, it seems, their Custom, and shouted twice in Token of their Vic-
tory: After which, they had the Mortification to see several of their
wounded Men fall, dying with the mere Loss of Blood.
The Spaniard Governor having drawn his little Body up together
upon a rising Ground, Atkins, though he was wounded, would have
had him march, and charge them again all together at once: But the
Spaniard reply'd, Seignior Atkins, you see how their wounded Men
fight, let them alone till Morning; all these wounded Men will be
stiff and sore with their Wounds, and faint with the Loss of Blood;
and so we shall have the fewer to engage.
The Advice was good: But Will Atkins reply'd merrily, That's
true, Seignior, and so shall I too; and that's the Reason I would go
on while I am warm. Well, Seignior Atkins, says the Spaniard, you
have behav'd gallantly, and done your Part; we will fight for you, if
you cannot come on, but I think it best to stay till Morning; so they
waited.
But as it was a clear Moonlight Night, and they found the Savages
in great Disorder about their dead and wounded Men, and a great
Hurry and Noise among them where they lay, they afterwards resolv'd
to fall upon them in the Night, especially if they could come to give
them but one Volley before they were discover'd, which they had a
fair Opportunity to do; for one of the two Englishmen, in whose
Quarter it was where the Fight began, led them round between the
Woods and Seaside Westward, and then turning short South, they
came so near where the thickest of them lay, that before they were seen
or heard, eight of them fired in among them, and did dreadful Execu-
tion upon them; in half a Minute more, eight others fired after
them, pouring in their small Shot in such a Quantity, that Abundance
were killed and wounded; and all this while they were not able to
see who hurt them, or which Way to fly.
The Spaniards charged again with the utmost Expedition, and then
divided themselves into three Bodies, and resolv'd to fall in among
them all together: They had in each Body eight Persons, that is to
say 24, whereof were a a Men, and the 2 Women, who by the Way
fought desperately.
They divided the Firearms equally in each Party, and so of the
3Si
Halberds and Staves: They would have had the Women keep back,
but they said they were resolv'd to die with their Husbands: Having
thus formed their little Army they marched out from among the
Trees, and they came up to the Teeth of the Enemy, shouting and hallow-
ing as loud as they could; the Savages stood all together, but were
in the utmost Confusion, hearing the Noise of our Men shouting from
three Quarters together; they would have fought if they had seen us:
And as soon as we came near enough to be seen, some Arrows were
shot, and poor old Friday was wounded, though not dangerously: But
our Men gave them no Time; but running up to them, fired among
them three Ways, and then fell in with the Butt-ends of their Muskets,
their Swords, armed Staves, and Hatchets, and laid about them so
well, that, in a Word, they set up a dismal Screaming and Howling,
flying to save their Lives which Way soever they could.

Our Men were tirea wvrn tne Execution; and Knied, or morcany
wounded, in the two Fights, about 180 of them; the rest, being
frighted out of their Wits, scoured through the Woods, and over the
Hills, with all the Speed and Fear that nimble Feet could help them
to do; and as we did not trouble ourselves much to pursue them,
they got all together to the Seaside, where they landed, and where
their Canoes lay. But their Disaster was not at an End yet; for it
blew a terrible Storm of Wind that Evening from the Seaward, so that
it was impossible for them to go off; nay, the Storm continuing all
Night, when the Tide came up, their Canoes were most of them
driven by the Surge of the Sea so high upon the Shore, that it requir'd
infinite Toil to get them off; and some of them were even dashed to
Pieces against the Beach, or against one another.
Our Men, though glad of their Victory, yet got little Rest thai
v u
Night; but having refresh'd themselves as well as they could, they
resolv'd to march to that Part of the Island where the Savages were
fled, and see what Posture they were in. This necessarily led them
over the Place where the Fight had been, and where they found
several of the poor Creatures not quite dead, and yet past recovering
Life; a Sight disagreeable enough to generous Minds; for a truly
great Man, though obliged by the Law of Battle to destroy his
Enemy, takes no Delight in his Misery.
However, there was no Need to give any Orders in this Case; for
their own Savages, who were their Servants, dispatch'd those pool
Creatures with their Hatchets.
At length they came in View of the Place where the more miserable
Remains of the Savages' Army lay, where there appear'd about an
hundred still; their Posture was generally sitting upon the Ground,
with their Knees up towards their Mouth, and the Head put between
the two Hands, leaning down upon the Knees.
When our Men came within two Musket Shot of them, the Spaniard
Governor ordered two Muskets to be fired without Ball, to alarm
them; this he did, that by their Countenance he might know what to
expect, viz. Whether they were still in Heart to fight, or were so
heartily beaten, as to be dispirited and discourag'd, and so he might
manage accordingly.
This Stratagem took; for, as soon as the Savages heard the first
Gun, and saw the Flash of the Second, they started up upon their
Feet in the greatest Consternation imaginable; and as our Men ad-
vanc'd swiftly towards them, they all ran screaming and yawling away,
with a Kind of a howling Noise, which our Men did not understand,
and had never heard before; and thus they ran up the Hills into the
Country.
At first, our Men had much rather the Weather had been calm, and
they had all gone away to Sea: But they did not then consider that
this might probably have been the Occasion of their coming again in
such Multitudes, as not to be resisted, or, at least, to come so many
and so often, as would quite desolate the Island, and starve them:
Will Atkiiis therefore, who, notwithstanding his Wound, kept always
with them, proved the best Counsellor in this Case: His Advice was,
to take the Advantage that offer'd, and clap in between them and
their Boats, and so deprive them of the Capacity of ever returning any
more to plague the Island.
They consulted long about this, and some were against it, for feai
jf making the Wretches fly to the Woods, and live there desperate;
and so they should have them to hunt like wild Beasts, be afraid to
stir out about their Business, and have their Plantations continually
rifled, and their tame Goats destroy'd, and, in short, be reduc'd to a
Life of continual Distress.
Will Atkins told them they had better have to do with a hundred
Men, than with a hundred Nations: That as they must destroy their
Boats, so they must destroy the Men, or be all of them destroy'd
themselves. In a Word, he showed them the Necessity of it so
plainly, that they all came into it; so they went to work immediately
with the Boats, and getting some dry Wood together from a dead
Tree, they tried to set some of them on Fire, but they were so wet,
that they would not burn; however, the Fire so burned the uppdT
Part, that it soon made them unfit for swimming in the Sea as Boats.
When the Indians saw what they were about, some of them came
running out of the Woods, and coming as near as they could to our
Men, kneeled down, and cried, Oa, Oa, Waramokoa, and some other
Words of their Language, which none of the others understood any-
thing of; but as they made pitiful Gestures, and strange Noises, it
was easy to understand, they begged to have their Boats spared, and
that they would be gone, and never come there again.
But our Men were now satisfy'd, that they had no Way to preserve
themselves, or to save the Colony, but effectually to prevent any of
these People from ever going Home again; depending upon this,
that if ever so much as one of them got back into their Country to tell
the Story, the Colony was undone; so that letting them know that
they should not have any Mercy, they fell to work with their Canoes,
and destroy'd them every one, that the Storm had not destroy'd before;
at the Sight of which, the Savages raised a hideous Cry in the Woods
which our People heard plain enough; after which, they ran about the
Island like distracted Men; so that, in a Word, our Men did not
really know at first what to do with them.
Nor did the Spaniards, with all their Prudence, consider, that
while they made those People thus desperate, they ought to have
kept good Guard at the same Time upon their Plantations; for
though it is true, they had driven away their Cattle, and the Indians
did not find out their main Retreat, I mean my old Castle at the Hill,
nor the Cave in the Valley, yet they found out my Plantation at tne
Bower, and pulled it all to Pieces, and all the Fences and Planting
about it; trod all the Corn under Foot; tore up the Vines and
Grapes, being just then almost ripe, and did to our men an inestimable
Damage, though to themselves not one Farthing's worth of Service.
Though our Men were able to fight them upon all Occasions, yet
they were in no Condition to pursue them, or hunt them up and down;
for as they were too nimble of Foot for our Men, when they found
them single, so our Men durst not go about single, for fear of being
surrounded with their Numbers. The best was, they had no Weapons,
for though they had Bows they had no Arrows left, nor any Materials
to make any, nor had they any edged Tool or Weapon among them.
The Extremity and Distress they were reduc'd to was great, and
indeed deplorable; but at the same Time, our Men were also
brought to very bad Circumstances by them; for though their Re-
treats were preserv'd, yet their Provision was destroy'd, and their
Harvest spoil'd, and what to do, or which Way to turn themselves,
they knew not: The only Refuge they had now, was the Stock of
Cattle they had in the Valley by the Cave, and some little Com
which grew there; and the Plantation of the three Englishmen, Wil-
liam Atkins and his Comrades, who were now reduc'd to two, one of
them being killed by an Arrow which struck him on the Side of his
Head, just under the Temple, so that he never spoke more; and it
was very remarkable, that this was the same barbarous Fellow who
cut the poor Savage Slave with his Hatchet, and who afterwards in-
tended to have murder'd all the Spaniards.
I looked upon their Case to have been worse at this Time, than
mine was at any Time, after I first discover'd the Grains of Barley
and Rice, and got into the Manner of planting and raising my Corn,
and my tame Cattle; for now they had, as I may say, a hundred
Wolves upon the Island, which would devour everything they could
come at, yet could very hardly be come at themselves.
The first Thing they concluded, when they saw what their Circum-
stances were, was, that they would, if possible, drive them up to the
farther Part of the Island, South-West, that if any more Savages came
on Shore, they might not find one another. Then, that they would daily
hunt and harass them, and kill as many of them as they could come
at, till they had reduc'd their Number; and if they could at last tame
them, and bring them to anything, they would give them Cora, and
teach them how to plant and live upon their daily Labour.

In order to this, they so follow'd them, and so terrify'd them with
their Guns, that in a few Days, if any of them fired a Gun at an
Indian, if he did not hit him, yet he would fall down for Fear; and
so dreadfully frighted they were, that they kept out of Sight farther
and farther, till at last our Men following them, and every Day al-
most killing and wounding some of them, they kept up in the Woods
and hollow Places so much, that it reduc'd them to the utmost Misery
for want of Food, and many were afterwards found dead in the Woods,
without any Hurt, but merely starved to Death.
When our Men found this, it made their Hearts relent, and Pity
moved them; especially the Spaniard Governor, who was the most
gentlemanly, generous-minded Man that ever I met with in my Life;
and he propos'd, if possible, to take one of them alive, and bring him
to understand what they meant, so far as to be able to act as Inter-
preter, and to go among them, and see if they might be brought to
some Conditions that might be depended upon, to save their Lives
and to do us no Spoil.
It was some while before any of them could be taken; but being
weak and half starved, one of them was at last surpris'd and made a
Prisoner; he was sullen at first, and would neither eat or drink,
but finding himself kindly used, and Victuals given him, and no
Violence offer'd him, he at last grew tractable, and came to him-
self.
They brought old Friday to him, who talked often with him, and
told him how kind the others would be to them all; that they would
not only save their Lives, but would give them a Part of the Island
to live in, provided they would give Satisfaction that they would keep
in their own Bounds, and not come beyond it, to injure or prejudice
others, and that they should have Corn given them, to plant and
make it grow for their Bread, and some Bread given them for their
present Subsistence; and old Friday bad the Fellow go and talk
with the rest of his Countrymen, and see what they said to it, assur-
ing them, that if they did not agree immediately, they should be all
destroy'd.
The poor Wretches, thoroughly humbled, and reduc'd in Number
Jo about thirty-seven, closed with the Proposal at the first Offer, and
begged to have some Food given them; upon which, twelve Spaniards
and two Englishmen, well armed, with three Indian Slaves, and old
Friday, marched to the Place where thev were: the three Tn linn
Slaves carry'd them a large Quantity of Bread; some Rice boiled up
to Cakes, and dried in the Sun, and three live Goats; and they were
order'd to go to the Side of a Hill, where they sat down, eat the Pro-
visions very thankfully, and were the most faithful Fellows to their
Words that could be thought of; for except when they came to beg
Victuals and Directions, they never came out of their Bounds;
and there they lived when I came to the Island, and I went to see
them.
They had taught them both to plant Corn, make Bread, bree<f
tame Goats and milk them; they wanted nothing but Wives, and
they soon would have been a Nation. They were confin'd to a Neck
of Land, surrounded with high Rocks behind them, and lying plain
towards the Sea before them, on the South-East Corner of the Island:
They had Land enough, and it was very good and fruitful; they had
a Piece of Land about a Mile and half broad, and three or four
Mile in Length.
Our Men taught them to make wooden Spades, such as I made
for myself, and gave them among them twelve Hatchets and three 01
four Knives; and there they lived the most subjected innocent
Creatures that ever were heard of.
After this, the Colony enjoy'd a perfect Tranquillity with Respect
to the Savages, till I came to revisit them, which was above two
Years: Not but that now and then some Canoes of Savages came
on Shore for their triumphal unnatural Feasts, but as they were of
several Nations, and perhaps had never heard of those that came
before, or the Reason of it, they did not make any Search or Inquiry
after their Countrymen; and if they had, it would have been very
hard to have found them out
Thus, I think, I have given a full Account of all that happen'd to
them, to my Return, at least that was worth Notice. The Indians or
Savages were wonderfully civiliz'd by them, and they frequently went
among them, but forbid, on Pain of Death, any one of the Indians
coming to them, because they would not have their Settlement be-
tray'd again.
One Thing was very remarkable, viz. that they taught the
Savages to make Wickerwork, or Baskets; but they soon outdid
their Masters; for they made abundance of most ingenious Things
in Wickerwork; particularly, all Sorts of Baskets, Sieves, Bird-Cages,
Cupboards, &*c, as also Chairs to sit on, Stools, Beds, Couches, and
abundance of other Things, being very ingenious at such Work, when
they were once put in the Way of it
My coming was a particular Relief to these People, because we
furnish'd them with Knives, Scissors, Spades, Shovels, Pick-axes, and
all Things of that Kind which they could want
With the Help of these Tools they were so very handy, that they
came at last to build up their Huts, or our Houses, very handsomely;
raddling or working it up like Basket-work all the way round, which
was a very extraordinary Piece of Ingenuity, and looked very odd,
but was an exceeding good Fence, as well against Heat, as against aU
Sorts of Vermin; and our Men were so taken with it, that they got
the wild Savages to come and do^he like for them; so that when I
came to see the two Englishmen's Colonies, they looked, at a Dis-
tance, as if they lived all like Bees in a Hive; and as for Will
Atkins, who was now become a very industrious, necessary, and sober
Fellow, he had made himself such a Tent of Basket-work as I believe
was never seen; it was r2o Paces round in the Outside, as I mea-
sur'd by my Steps ; the Walls were as close worked as a Basket, in Pa-
nels or Squares of 32 in Number, and very strong, standing about
seven Foot high; in the middle was another not above 22 Paces
round, but built stronger, being Eight-square in its Form, and in the
eight Corners stood eight very strong Posts, round the Top of which
he laid strong Pieces pinned together with wooden Pins, from which
he raised a Pyramid for the Roof of eight Rafters, very handsome,
I assure you, and joined together very well, though he had no Nails,
and only a few iron Spikes, which he made himself too, out of the
old Iron that I had left there; and indeed this Fellow showed abun-
dance of Ingenuity in several Things which he had no Knowledge
of; he made him a Forge, with a Pair of wooden Bellows to blow
the Fire; he made himself Charcoal for his Work, and he formed out
of one of the Iron Crows a middling good Anvil to hammer upon;
in this Manner he made many Things, but especially Hooks, Staples
and Spikes, Bolts and Hinges. But to return to the House; after
he had pitched the Roof of his innermost Tent, he worked it up be-
tween the Rafters with Basket-work so firm, and thatched that over
again so ingeniously with Rice-straw, and over that a large Leaf of a
Tree, which cover'd the Top, that his House was as dry as if it had
been tiled or slated. Indeed he owned that the Savages made the
Basket-work for him.
The outer Circuit was cover'd, as a Lean-to, all round this inna
Apartment, and long Rafters lay from the two-and-thirty Angles to
the top Posts of the inner House, being about twenty Foot Distance;
so that there was a Space like a Walk within the outer wicker Wall,
and without the inner, near twenty Foot wide.
The inner Place he partition'd off with the same Wickerwork, but
much fairer, and divided it into six Apartments, so that he had six
Rooms on a Floor; and out of every one of these there was a Door,
first into the Entry or Coming into the main Tent, and another Door
into the Space or Walk that was round it; so that Walk was also
divided into six equal Parts, which served not only for Retreat, but
to store up any Necessaries which the Family had Occasion for.
These six Spaces not taking up the whole Circumference, what other
Apartments the outer Circle had were thus order'd: As soon as you
were in at the Door of the outer Circle, you had a short Passage
straight before you to the Door of the inner House, but on either
side was a Wicker Partition, and a Door in it, by which you
went, first into a large Room or Storehouse, twenty Foot wide
and about thirty Foot long, and through that into another
not quite so long; so that in the outer Circle was ten handsome
Rooms, six of which were only to be come at through the Apartments
of the inner Tent, and served as Closets or retiring Rooms to th«*
respective Chambers of the inner Circle; and four large Warehouses
or Barns, or what you please to call them, which went in through one
another, two on either Hand of the Passage that led through the
outer Door to the inner Tent
Such a Piece of Basket-work, I believe, was never seen in the
World, nor a House, or Tent, so neatly contriv'd, much less, so
built In this great Beehive lived the three Families, that is to say,
Will Atkins and his Companion; the third was killed, but his Wife
remain'd with three Children; for she was, it seems, big with Child
when he died, and the other two were not at all backward to give the
Widow her full Share of everything, I mean, as to their Corn, Milk,
Grapes, drc, and when they killed a Kid, or found a Turtle on the
Shore; so that they all lived well enough, though it was true they
were not so industrious as the other two, as has been observ'd al-
ready.
One Thing, however, cannot be omitted, viz. That as for Religion,
I don't know that there was anything of that Kind among them)
they pretty often indeed put one another in Mind that there was a
God, by the very common Method of Seamen, viz. Swearing by .is
Name: Nor were their poor ignorant savage Wives much the better for
having been marry'd to Christians, as we must call them; for as they
knew very little of God themselves, so they were utterly incapable of
entering into any Discourse with their Wives about a God, or to talk
anything to them concerning Religion.
The utmost of all the Improvement which I can say the Wives
had made from them was, that they had taught them to speak Eng-
lish pretty well, and all the Children they had, which were near 20 in
all, were taught to speak English too, from their first learning to speak,
though they at first spoke it in a very broken Manner, like their Mothers.
There were none of these Children above six years old when I came
thither, for it was not much above seven Years that they had fetched
these five savage Ladies over, but they had all been pretty fruitful,
for they had all Children, more or less: I think the Cook's Mate's
Wife was big of her sixth Child; and the Mothers were all a good
Sort of well-govern'd, quiet, laborious Women, modest and decent,
helpful to one another; mighty observant and subject to their Masters,
I cannot call them Husbands; and wanted nothing but to be well
instructed in the Christian Religion, and to be legally marry'd; both
which were happily brought about afterwards by my Means, or, at
least, in Consequence of my Coming among them.
Having thus given an Account of the Colony in general, and pretty
much of my five Runagate Englishmen, I must say something of the
Spaniards, who were the main Body of the Family; and in whose
Story there are some Incidents also remarkable enough.
I had a great many Discourses with them about their Circum-
stances when they were among the Savages: They told me readily,
that they had no Instances to give of their Application or Ingenuity
in that Country; that they were a poor miserable dejected Handful
of People; that if Means had been put into their Hands, they had
yet so abandon'd themselves to Despair, and so sunk under the
Weight of their Misfortunes, that they thought of nothing but Starv-
ing: One of them, a grave and very sensible Man, told me he was
convinc'd they were in the Wrong; that it was not the Part of wise
Men to give up themselves to their Misery, but always to take Hold ol
the Helps which Reason offer'd, as well for present Support as for future
Deliverance. He told me that Grief was the most senseless insigni-
ficant Passion in the World; for that it regarded only Things past,
which were generally impossible to be recall'd or to be remedy'd, but
had no View to Things to come, and had no Share in anything that looked
like Deliverance, but rather added to the Affliction than propos'd a
Remedy: And upon this, he repeated a Spanish Proverb; which
though I cannot repeat in just the same Words that he spoke
in, yet I remember I made it into an English Proverb of my own,
thus:
In Trouble to be troulfd,
It to have your Trouble doubCd.
He ran on then in Remarks upon all the little Improvements I had
made in my Solitude; my unweary'd Application, as he called it,
and how I had made a Condition, which, in its Circumstances, was at
first much worse than theirs a thousand Times, more happy than theirs
was, even now, when they were all together. He told me it was remark-
able that Englishmen had a greater Presence of Mind in their Dis-
tress than any People that ever he met with; that their unhappy
Nation, and the Portuguese, were the worst Men in the World to
struggle with Misfortunes; for that their first Step in Dangers, after the
common Efforts are over, was always to despair, lie down under it,
and die, without rousing their Thoughts up to proper Remedies
for Escape.
I told him their Case and mine differ'd exceedingly, that they were
cast upon the Shore without Necessaries, without Supply of Food,
or of present Sustenance, till they could provide : That it is true, I had
this Disadvantage and Discomfort, that I was alone; but then the
Supplies I had providentially thrown into my Hands, by the unex-
pected driving of the Ship on Shore, was such a Help as would have
encourag'd any Creature in the World to have apply'd himself as I
had done. Seignior, says the Spaniard, had we poor Spaniards been
in your Case, we should never have gotten half those Things out of
the Ship as you did: Nay, says he, we should never have found
Means to have gotten a Raft to carry them, or to have gotten
the Raft on Shore 'without Boat or Sail; and how much less should
we have done, said he, if any of us had been alone? Well, I desi^d
him to abate his Compliment, and go on with the History of their
coming on Shore, where they landed: He told me they unhappily
landed »X a Place where there were People without Provisions -
whereas had they had the common Sense to have put off to Sea
Itgain, and gone to another Island a little farther, they had found
Provisions, though without People; there being an Island that Way,
as they had been told, where there was Provisions, though no People;
that is to say, that the Spaniards of Trinidad had frequently been
there, and had filled the Island with Goats and Hogs at several Times;
where they have bred in such Multitudes, and where Turtle and Sea-
Fowls were in such Plenty, that they could have been in no Want of
Flesh, though they had found no Bread; whereas here, they were
only sustain'd with a few Roots and Herbs, which they understood
not, and which had no Substance in them, and which the Inhabitants
gave them sparingly enough, and who could treat them no better,
unless they would turn Cannibals, and eat Men's Flesh, which was
the great Dainty of their Country.
They gave me an Account how many Ways they strove to civilize
the Savages they were with, and to teach them rational Customs in the
ordinary Way of Living, but in vain; and how they retorted it upon
them as unjust, that they who came there for Assistance and Support,
should attempt to set up for Instructors of those that gave them
Bread; intimating, it seems, that none should set up for the Instruc-
tors of others, but those who could live without them.
They gave me dismal Accounts of the Extremities they were driven
to; how sometimes they were many Days without any Food at all;
the Island they were upon being inhabited by a Sort of Savages that
lived more indolent, and for that Reason were less supplied with the
Necessaries of Life, than they had Reason to believe others were in
the same Part of the World; and yet they found, that these Savages
were less ravenous and voracious, than those who had better Supplies
of Food.
Also they added, That they could not but see with what Demon-
strations of Wisdom and Goodness the governing Providence of God
directs the Events of Things in the World; which, they said, appear'd
in their Circumstances; for if, pressed by the Hardships they were
under, and the Barrenness of the Country where they were, they had
searched after a better Place to live in, they had then been out ol
the Way of the Relief that happen'd to them by my Means.
Then they gave me an Account how the Savages, whom they lived
among, expected them to go out with them into their Wars: And h
was true that, as they had Firearms with them, had they not had the
Disaster to lose their Ammunition, they should not have been ser-
viceable only to their Friends, but have made themselves terrible
both to Friends and Enemies; but being without Powder and Shot,
and yet in a Condition that they could not in Reason deny to go out
with their Landlords to their Wars; when they came into the P teld
of Battle, they were in a worse Condition than the Savages themselves,
for they neither had Bows or Arrows, nor could they use those the
Savages gave them; so that they could do nothing but stand still, and
be wounded with Arrows, till they came up to the Teeth of their
Enemy, and then indeed the three Halberts they had were of Use
to them; and they would often drive a whole little Army before them
with those Halberds and sharpen'd Sticks put into the Muzzles of their
Muskets: But that for all this they were sometimes surrounded with
Multitudes, and in great Danger from their Arrows, till at last they
found the Way to make themselves large Targets of Wood, which
they cover'd with Skins of wild Beasts, whose Names they knew not;
and these cover'd them from the Arrows of the Savages; that not-
withstanding these, they were sometimes in great Danger, and were
once five of them knocked down together with the Clubs of the
Savages, which was the Time when one of them was taken Prisoner;
that is to say, the Spaniard whom I had reliev'd, that at first they
thought had been killed: But when afterwards they heard he was taken
Prisoner, they were under the greatest Grief imaginable, and would
willingly have ventur'd their Lives to have rescu'd him.
They told me that when they were so knocked down, the rest of
their Company rescu'd them, and stood over them, fighting till they
were come to themselves, all but him who they thought had been
dead; and then they made their Way with their Halberds and Pieces,
standing close together in a Line, through a Body of above a thousand
Savages, beating down all that came in their Way, got the Victory
over their Enemies, but to their great Sorrow, because it was with the
Loss of their Friend; whom, the other Party finding him alive, carry'd
off with some others, as I gave an Account in my former.
They describ'd most affectionately how they were surpris'd with
Joy at the Return of their Friend and Companion in Misery,
who they thought had been devour'd by wild Beasts of the worst
kind, (viz.) by wild Men; and yet how more and more they were
surpris'd with the Account he gave them of his Errand, and that
there was a Christian in any Place near, much more one
that was able, and had Humanity enough to contribute to theii
Deliverance.
They describ'd how they were astonish'd at the Sight of the Relief
I sent them, and at the Appearance of Loaves of Bread, Things they
had not seen since their coming to that miserable Place ; how often
they crossed it, and blessed it, as Bread sent from Heaven; and what
a reviving Cordial it was to their Spirits to taste it; as also of the
other Things I had sent for their Supply. And after all, they would
have told me something of the Joy they were in at the Sight of a
Boat and Pilots to carry them away to the Person and Place from
whence all these new Comforts came; but they told me it was impos-
sible to express it by Words, for their excessive Joy, naturally driving
them to unbecoming Extravagances, they had no way to describe
them but by telling me that they border'd upon Lunacy, having no
way to give Vent to their Passion suitable to the Sense that was upon
them; that in some it worked one Way, and in some another; and
that some of them, through a Surprise of Joy, would burst out into
Tears; others be stark mad, and others immediately faint This
Discourse extremely affected me, and called to my Mind Frida/s
Ecstasy, when he met his Father, and the poor People's Ecstasy,
when I took them up at Sea, after their Ship was on Fire; the
Mate of the Ship's Joy, when he found himself deliver^ in the
Place where he expected to perish; and my own Joy when after
»8 Years' Captivity, I found a good Ship ready to carry me to my own
Country. All these Things made me more sensible of the Relation
of those poor Men, and more affected with it
Having thus given a View of the State of Things as I found them,
I must relate the Heads of what I did for these People, and the
Condition in which I left them. It was their Opinion and mine too,
that they would be troubled no more with the Savages; or that if they
were, they would be able to cut them off, if they were twice as many
as before; so they had no Concern about that Then I enter'd into
a serious Discourse with the Spaniard, whom I call Governor, about
their Stay in the Island; for as I was not come to carry any of them
off, so it would not be just to carry off some, and leave others, who
perhaps would be unwilling to stay, if their Strength was diminished.
On the other hand, I told them I came to establish them there,
not to remove them; and then I let them know that I had brought
with me Relief of sundry Kinds for them; That I had been at a great
Charge to supply them with all Things necessary, as well for theit
Convenience, as their Defence; and that I had such and such parti-
cular Persons with me, as well to increase and recruit their Number,
as by the particular necessary Employments which they were bred to,
being Artificers, to assist them in those Things, in which, at present,
they were to seek.
They were all together when I talked thus to them; and before I
delivered to them the Stores I had brought, I asked them one by one,
If they had entirely forgot, and bury'd the first Animosities that had
been among them, and would shake Hands with one another, and
engage in a strict Friendship and Union of Interest, that so there
might be no more Misunderstandings or Jealousies.
Will Atkins, with abundance of Frankness and good Humour,
said, They had met with Afflictions enough to make them all sober,
and Enemies enough to make them all Friends; that for his Part, he
would live and die with them; and was so far from designing any-
thing against the Spaniards, that he owned they had done nothing
to him but what his own mad Humour made necessary, and what
he would have done, and perhaps much worse, in their Case; and
that he would ask them Pardon, if I desir'd it, for the foolish and
brutish Things he had done to them; and was very willing and de-
sirous of living in Terms of entire Friendship and Union with them;
and would do anything that lay in his Power to convince them of it;
and as for going to England, he cared not if he did not go thither
these twenty Years.
The Spaniards said, They had indeed at first disarm'd and ex-
cluded Will Atkins and his two Countrymen for their ill Conduct,
as they had let me know; and they appeal'd to me, for the Neces-
sity they were under to do so: But that Will Atkins had behav'd
himself so bravely in the great Fight they had with the Savages, and
on several Occasions since, and had showed himself so faithful to.
and concern'd for, the general Interest of them all, that they had for-
gotten all that was past, and thought he merited as much to be
trusted with Arms, and supply'd with Necessaries, as any of
them; and that they had testify'd their Satisfaction in him by
committing the Command to him, next to the Governor himself.
And as they had an entire Confidence in him and all his Countrymen,
so they acknowledg'd they had merited that Confidence by all the
Methods that honest Men could merit to be valued and trusted;
and they most heartily embrac'd the Occasion of giving me this
Assurance, that they would never have any Interest separate from one
another.
Upon these frank and open Declarations of Friendship, we ap-
pointed the next Day to dine all together; and indeed we made <
splendid Feast: I caused the Ship's Cook and his Mate to come
on Shore, and dress our Dinner; and the old Cook's Mate we had on
Shore, assisted. We brought on Shore six Pieces of good Beef, and
four Pieces of Pork out of the Ship's Provision, with our Punch-bowl,
*nd Materials to fill it; and in particular, I gave them ten Bottles of
French Claret, and ten Bottles of English Beer; Things that neither
the Spaniards, or the Englishmen had tasted for many Years, and
which, it may be supposed, they were exceedingly glad of.
The Spaniards added to our Feast five whole Kids, which the
Cooks roasted; and three of them were sent cover'd up close on
Board the Ship, to the Seamen, that they might feast on fresh Meat
from on Shore, as we did with their Salt Meat from on Board.
After this Feast, at which we were very innocently merry, I brought
out my Cargo of Goods, wherein, that there might be no Dispute
about dividing, I showed them that there was sufficient for them all;
and desir'd that they might all take an equal Quantity of the Goods that
were for wearing; that is to say, equal when made up; as first, I dis-
tributed Linen sufficient to make every one of them four Shirts; and
at the Spaniards' Request afterwards, made them up six; these were
exceeding comfortable to them, having been what, as I may say, they
had long since forgot the Use of, or what it was to wear them.
I allotted the thin English Stuffs, which I mention'd before, to
make every one a light Coat, like a Frock, which I judged fittest for
the Heat of the Season; cool and loose, and order'd, that whenever
they decayed, they should make more, as they thought fit: The like
for Pumps, Shoes, Stockings and Hats, Grc.
I cannot express what Pleasure, what Satisfaction, sat upon the
Countenances of all these poor Men, when they saw the Care I had
taken of them, and how well I had furnish'd them; they told me I
was a Father to them, and that having such a Correspondent as I
was, in so remote a Part of the World, it would make them forget that
mey were left in a desolate Place; and they all voluntarily engag'd
to me not to leave the Place without my Consent
Then I presented to them the People I had brought with me, par
ticularly the Tailor, the Smith, and the two Carpenters, all of them
most necessary People; but above all, my general Artificer, than
whom they could not name anything that was more useful to them.
And the Tailor, to show his Concern for them, went to work imme-
diately, and, with my Leave, made them every one a Shirt the first
Thing he did; and, which was still more, he taught the Women, not
only how to sew and stitch, and use the Needle, but made them
assist to make the Shirts for their Husbands and for all the rest
As to the Carpenters, I scarce need mention how useful they were,
for they took in pieces all my clumsy unhandy Things, and made
them clever convenient Tables, Stools, Bedsteads, Cupboards,
Lockers, Shelves, and everything they wanted of that Kind.
But to let them see how Nature made Artificers at first, I carried
the Carpenters to see Will Atkins's Basket-house, as I called it, and
they both owned they never saw an Instance of such natural Ingenuity
before; nor anything so regular, and so handily built, at least of its
Kind: And one of them, when he saw it, after musing a good while,
turning about to me, I am sure, says he, that Man has no need of us;
you need do nothing but give him Tools.
Then I brought them out all my Store of Tools, and gave every
Man a Digging-Spade, a Shovel, and a Rake, for we had no Harrows
or Ploughs; and to every separate Place a Pick-axe, a Crow, a broad
Axe, and a Saw; always appointing, that as often as any were broken,
or worn out, they should be supply'd without grudging, out of the
general Stores that I left behind.
Nails, Staples, Hinges, Hammers, Chisels, Knives, Scissors, and all
sorts of Tools, and Iron-work, they had without Tale, as they requir'd,
for no Man would care to take mose than they wanted, and he must be
a Fool that would waste or spoil them, on any Account whatever; and,
for the Use of the Smith, I left two Ton of unwrought Iron for a Supply.
My Magazine of Powder and Arms, which I brought them, was
such, even to I'rofusion, that they could not but rejoice at them, for
now they could march as I used to do, with a Musket upon each
Shoulder, if there was Occasion, and were able to fight a thousand
Savages, if they had but some little Advantages of Situation, which
also they could not miss of if they had Occasion.
I carry'd on Shore with me the young Man, whose Mother was
starved to Death, and the Maid also; she was a sober, well educated,
religious young Woman, and behaved so inoffensively that every one
g&ve her a good Word; she had indeed an unhappy Life with us,
there being no Woman in the Ship but herself; but she bore it with
Patience. After a while, seeing Things so well order'd and in so
fine a way of thriving upon my Island, and considering that they had
neither Business or Acquaintance in the East Indies, or Reason foi
taking so long a Voyage: I say, considering all this, both of them
came to me, and desir'd I would give them leave to remain on the
Island, and be enter'd among my Family, as they called it
I agreed to it readily, and they had a little Plot of Ground allotted
to them, where they had three Tents or Houses set up, surrounded with
a Basket-work, Palisado'd like Atkins's, adjoining to his Plantation:
Their Tents were contriv'd so, that they had each of them a Room
apart to lodge in, and a middle Tent like a great Storehouse to lay
all their Goods in, and to eat and drink in; and now the other two
Englishmen remov'd their Habitation to the same Place, and so the
Island was divided into three Colonies, and no more, viz. thp
Spaniards with old Friday, and the first Servants, at my old Habita-
tion under the Hill; which was, in a word, the capital City; and
where they had so enlarg'd and extended their Works, as well under
as on rhe outside of the Hill, that they lived, though perfectly con-
ceal'd, yet full at large. Never was there such a little City in a Wood,
and so hid, I believe, in any Part of the World; for I verily believe,
a thousand Men might have ranged the Island a Month, and if they
had not known there was such a Thing, and looked on purpose for it
they would not have found it; for the Trees stood so thick and so
close, and grew so fast matted into one another, that nothing but
cutting them down first could discover the Place; except the only
two narrow Entrances, where they went in and out, could be found,
which was not very easy; one of them was just down at the Watep
Edge of the Creek, and it was afterwards above two hundred Yards to
the Place ; and the other was up the Ladder at twice, as I have already
formerly describ'd it; and they had a large Wood thick planted, also,
on the Top of the Hill, which contain'd above an Acre, which grew
apace, and cover'd the Place from all Discovery there, with only one
narrow Place between two Trees, not easy to be discover'd, to enter
on that Side.
The other Colony was that of W. Atkins's, where there were four
Families of Englishmen, I mean those I had left there, with their
Wives and Children; three Savases th»» were Siaves; the Widow
E E
and Children of the Englishman that was killed; the young Man and
the Maid; and by the way, we made a Wife of her also, before we
went away: There were also the two Carpenters and the Tailor,
whom I brought with me for them; also the Smith, who was a very
necessary Man to them, especially as a Gunsmith, to take care of
their Arms; and my other Man, whom I called Jack of all Trades;
who was in himself as good, almost, as 20 Men, for he was not only
a very ingenious Fellow, but a very merry Fellow, and before I went
away, we married him to the honest Maid that came with the Youth
in the Ship, I mention'd before.
And now I speak of Marrying, it brings me naturally to say some-
thing of the French Ecclesiastic that I had brought with me out of
the Ship's Crew, whom I took up at Sea. It is true, this Man was a
Roman, and perhaps it may give Offence to some hereafter if I leave
anything extraordinary upon Record of a Man whom, before I
begin, I must (to set him out in just Colours), represent in Terms
very much to his Disadvantage, in the Account of Protestants; as
first, that he was a Papist; secondly, a popish Priest; and thirdly, a
French popish Priest
But Justice demands of me to give him a due Character; and I
must say he was a grave, sober, pious, and most religious Person;
exact in his Life, extensive in his Charity, and exemplar in almost
everything he did; what then can any one say against my being
very sensible of the Value of such a Man, notwithstanding his Pro-
fession? Though it may be my Opinion, perhaps, as well as the
Opinion of others who shall read this, that he was mistaken.
The first Hour that I began to converse with him, after he had
agreed to go with me to the East Indies, I found Reason to delight
exceedingly in his Conversation; and he first began with me abouf
Religion in the most obliging Manner imaginable.
Sir, says he, you have not only, under God (and at that he crossed
his Breast), saved my Life, but you have admitted me to go this Voy-
age in your Ship, and by your obliging Civility have taken me into
your Family, giving me an Opportunity of free Conversation. Now
Sir, says he, you see by my Habit what my Profession is, and I guess
by your Nation what yours is: I may think it is my Duty, and doubt-
less it is so, to use my utmost Endeavours, on all Occasions, to bring
all the Souls I can to the Knowledge of the Truth, and to embraco
the Catholic Doctrine; but as I am here under your Permission, and
In your Family, I am bound in Justice to your Kindness, as well as
in Decency and good Manners, to be under your Government; and
therefore I shall not, without your Leave, enter into any Debates on
the Point of Religion, in which we may not agree, farther than you
shall give me Leave.
I told him, his Carriage was so modest, that I could not but
acknowledge it; that it was true, we were such People as they called
Heretics; but that he was not the first Catholic that I had convers'd
with, without falling into any Inconveniencies, or carrying the Ques-
tions to any height in Debate: That he should not find himself the
worse used for being of a different Opinion from us, and if we did
not converse without any Dislike on either Side upon that Score, it
should be his Fault, not ours.
He reply'd, that he thought all our Conversation might be easily
separated from Disputes: That it was not his Business to cap
Principles with every Man he discours'd with; and that he rather
desir'd me to converse with him as a Gentleman, than as a Religieuse;
that if I would give him leave at any time to discourse upon reli-
gious Subjects, he would readily comply with it; and that then, he
did not doubt but I would allow him also to defend his own Opinions,
as well as he could; but that without my Leave he would not break
in upon me with any such thing.
He told me farther, that he would not cease to do all that became
him in his Office, as a Priest, as well as a private Christian, to pro-
cure the Good of the Ship, and the Safety of all that was in her; and
though perhaps we would not join with him, and he could not pray
with us, he hoped he might pray for us, which he would do upon all
Occasions. In this Manner we convers'd, and as he was of a most
obliging Gentleman-like Behaviour; so he was, if I may be allow'd to
say so, a Man of good Sense, and as I believe, of great Learning.
He gave me a most diverting Account of his Life, and of the many
extraordinary Events of it; of many Adventures which had befallen
him in the few Years that he had been abroad in the World, and
particularly this was very remarkable, (viz.) That in the Voyage he
was now engag'd, he had had the Misfortune to be five times shipped
and unshipp'd, and never to go to the Place whither any of the Ships,
he was in, were at first design'd: That his first Intent was to have
gone to Martinico, and that he went on board a Ship bound thither,
at St. Malo; but being forced into Lisbon by bad Weather, the Ship
received some Damage, by running aground in the Mouth of the
River Tagus, and was oblig'd to unload her Cargo there; that find-
ing a Portuguese Ship there bound to the Madeiras, and ready to sail,
and supposing he should easily meet with a Vessel there bound to
Martinko, he went on board, in order to sail to the Madeiras; but
the Master of the Portuguese Ship being but an indifferent Mariner,
had been out in his Reckoning, and they drove to Fayal; where, how-
ever, he happen'd to find a very good Market for his Cargo, which
was Corn, and therefore resolv'd not to go to the Madeiras, but to
load Salt at the Isle of May, and to go away to Newfoundland: He had
no Remedy in this Exigence, but to go with the Ship, and had a
pretty good Voyage as far as the Banks, so they call the Place where
they catch the Fish, where meeting with a French Ship, bound from
France to Quebec in the River of Canada, and from thence to Mar-
tinko, to carry Provisions, he thought he should have an Opportunity
to complete his first Design: But when he came to Quebec, the
Master of the Ship died, and the Ship proceeded no farther; so the
next Voyage he shipped himself for France, in the Ship that was
burnt, when we took them up at Sea, and then shipped with us foi
the East Indies, as I have already said: Thus he had been disap-
pointed in five Voyages, all, as I may call it, in one Voyage, besides
what I shall have Occasion to mention farther of the same Person.
But, I shall not make Digressions into other Men's Stories, which
have no Relation to my own. I return to what concerns our Affair
in the Island: He came to me one Morning, for he lodged among
us all the while we were upon the Island; and it happen'd to be
just when I was going to visit the Englishmen's Colony, at the
farthest Part of the Island, I say, he came to me and told me, with
a very grave Countenance, that he had for two or three Days desir'd
an Opportunity of some Discourse with me, which he hoped shoulrf
not be displeasing to me, because he thought it might in some
Measure correspond with my general Design, which was the Pros-
perity of my new Colony, and perhaps might put it, at least more
than he yet thought it was, in the Way of God's Blessing.
I looked a little surpris'd at the last Part of his Discourse, and
turning a little short, How Sir, said I, can it be said, that we are not in
the Way of God's Blessing, after such visible Assistances and wonderful
Deliverances, as we have seen here, and of whkh I have given you 4
large Account I
If you had pleased, Sir, said he, with a world of Modesty, and yet
with great Readiness, to have heard me, you would have found no
room to have been displeas'd, much less to think so hard of me, that
I should suggest, that you have not had wonderful Assistances
and Deliverances; and I hope, on your Behalf, that you are in the
Way of God's Blessing, and your Design is exceeding good, and
vill prosper: But, Sir, though it were more so, than is even possible
co you, yet there may be some among you that are not equally right
in their Actions: And you know, that in the Story of the Children of
Israel, one Achan in the Camp, remov'd God's Blessing from them,
and turned his Hand so against them, that six-and-thirty of them,
though not concern'd in the Crime, were the Object of Divine
Vengeance, and bore the Weight of that Punishment
I was sensibly touched with this Discourse, and told him, his In-
ference was so just, and the whole Design seemed so sincere, and was
really so religious in its own Nature, that I was very sorry I had in-
terrupted him, and begged him to go on; and in the mean Time,
because it seemed, that what we had both to say might take up some
Time, I told him, I was going to the Englishmen's Plantations, and
asked him to go with me, and we might discourse of it by the Way:
He told me, he would more willingly wait on me thither, because
there partly the Thing was acted, which he desir'd to speak to me
about, so we walked on; and I pressed him to be free and plain
with me, in what he had to say.
Why then, Sir, says he, be pleased to give me Leave to lay down
a few Propositions, as the Foundation of what I have to say, that we
may not differ in the general Principles, though we may be of some
differing Opinions in the Practice of Particulars. First, Sir, though
we differ in some of the doctrinal Articles of Religion; and it is very
unhappy that it is so, especially in the Case before us, as I shall show
afterwards: Yet there are some general Principles in which we
both agree, (viz.) first, That there is a God; and that this God
having given us some stated general Rules for our Service and
Obedience, we ought not willingly and knowingly to offend him;
either by neglecting to do what he has commanded, or by doing
what he has expressly forbidden: And let our different Re-
ligions be what they will, this general Principle is readily owned
by us all, That the Blessing of God does not ordinarily follow a
presumptuous sinning against his Command; and every good
Christian will be affectionately concern'd to prevent any that are
under his Care, living in a total Neglect of God and his Commands.
It is not your Men being Protestants, whatever my Opinion may be
of such, that discharges me from being concern'd for their Souls, and
from endeavouring, if it lies before me, that they should live in as
little Distance from and Enmity with their Maker, as possible, espe-
cially if you give me Leave to meddle so far in your Circuit
I could not yet imagine what he aimed at, and told him, I granted
all he had said, and thanked him, that he would so far concern him-
self for us; and begged he would explain the Particulars of what he
had observ'd, that, like Joshua, to take his own Parable, I might put
away the accursed Thing from us.
Why then, Sir, says he, I will take the Liberty you give me; and
there are three Things, which, if I am right, must stand in the Way
of God's Blessing upon your Endeavours here, and which 1 should
rejoice for your sake, and their own, to see remov'd. And, Sir, says
he, I promise myself, that you will fully agree with me in them all, as
soon as I name them; especially because I shall convince you, that
every one of them may, with great Ease, and very much to your Satis-
faction, be remedy'd.
He gave me no Leave to put in any more Civilities, but went on.
First, Sir, says he, you have here four Englishmen, who have
fetched Women from among the Savages, and have taken them as
their Wives, and have had many Children by them all, and yet are
not marry'd to them after any stated legal Manner, as the Laws of
God and Man require; and therefore are yet, in the Sense of both,
no less than Adulterers, and living in Adultery. To this, Sir, says he,
I know you will object, That there was no Clergyman or Priest of
any Kind, or of any Profession, to perform the Ceremony; nor any
Pen and Ink, or Paper, to write down a Contract of Marriage, and
have it signed between them. And I know also, Sir, what the
Spaniard Governor has told you; I mean of the Agreement that he
oblig'd them to make, when they took these Women (viz.) That
they should choose them out by Consent, and keep separately to
them; which, by the way, is nothing of a Marriage, no Agreement
with the Women, as Wives, but only an Agreement among them-
selves, to keep them from quarrelling.
But, Sir, the Essence of the Sacrament of Matrimony (so he called
it, being a Roman) consists not only in the mutual Consent of the
Parties to take one another, as Man and Wife, but in the formal and
legal Obligation, that there is in the Contract, to compel the Man and
Woman at all Times, to own and acknowledge each other, obliging
the Men to abstain from all other Women, to engage in no other
Contract while these subsist; and on all Occasions, as Ability allows,
to provide honestly for them and their Children, and to oblige the
Women to the same, or like Conditions, mutatis mutandis, on their Side.
Now, Sir, says he, these Men may, when they please, or when
Occasion presents, abandon these Women, disown their Children,
leave them to perish, and take other Women, and marry them whilst
these are living. And here he added, with some Warmth, How, Sir,
is God honour'd in this unlawful Liberty? And how shall a Blessing
succeed your Endeavours in this Place, however good in themselves,
and however sincere in your Design, while these Men, who at present
are your Subjects, under your absolute Government and Dominion,
are allow'd by you to live in open Adultery?
I confess, I was struck at the Thing itself, but much more with the
convincing Arguments he supported it with; for it was certainly true,
that though they had no Clergyman upon the Spot, yet a formal
Contract on both Sides, made before Witnesses, and confirm'd by
any Token, which they had all agreed to be bound by, though it had
been but breaking a Stick between them, engaging the Men to
own these Women for their Wives, upon all Occasions, and never to
abandon them or their Children, and the Women to the same with
their Husbands, had been an effectual lawful Marriage in the Sight
of God; and it was a great Neglect that it was not done.
But I thought to have gotten off with my young Priest, by telling
him, that all that Part was done when I was not here, and they had
lived so many Years with them now, that if it was an Adultery, it
was past Remedy, they could do nothing in it now.
Sir, says he, ashing your Pardon for such Freedom, you are right in
this, that it being done in your Absence, you could not be charged
with that Part of the Crime: But I beseech you, flatter not yourself,
that you are not therefore under an Obligation to do your utmost
now to put an End to it How can you think, but that, let the
Time past lie on whom it will, all the Guilt, for the future, will lie
entirely upon you? Because it is certainly in your Power now to put
an End to it, and in nobody's Power but yours.
I was so dull still that I did not take him right; but I imagin'd,
that by putting an End to it, he meant that I should part them, and
not suffer them to live together any longer; And I said to him, I
could not do that by any Means, for that it would put the whole
Island into Confusion: He seemed surpris'd, that I should so far
mistake him. No, Sir, says he, I do not mean, that you should now
separate them, but legally and effectually marry them now; and as,
Sir, my Way of marrying them may not be so easy to reconcile them
to, though it will be as effectual, even by your own Laws, so your
Way may be as well before God, and as valid among Men; I mean,
by a written Contract, signed by both Man and Woman, and by all
the Witnesses present, which all the Laws of Europe would decree to
be valid.
I was amaz'd to see so much true Piety, and so much Sincerity of
Keal, besides the unusual Impartiality in his Discourse, as to his own
Party or Church, and such true Warmth for the preserving People that
he had no Knowledge of, or Relation to; I say, for preserving them
from transgressing the Laws of God; the like of which I had indeed
not met with anywhere: but recollecting what he had said, of marrying
them by a written Contract, which I knew would stand too ; I return'd
it back upon him, and told him, I granted all that he had said to
be just, and on his Part very kind, that I would discourse with the
Men upon the Point now, when I came to them: And I knew no
Reason why they should scruple to let him marry them all, which I
knew well enough would be granted to be as authentic and valid in
England, as if they were married by one of our own Clergymen. What
was afterwards done in this matter, I shall speak of by itself.
I then pressed him to tell me what was the second Complaint which
he had to make, acknowledging, that I was very much his Debtoi
for the first, and thanked him heartly for it He told me, he would
use the same Freedom and Plainness in the second, and hoped I
would take it as well: And this was, that notwithstanding these
English Subjects of mine, as he called them, had lived with those
Women for almost seven Years, had taught them to speak English,
and even to read it; and that they were, as he perceiv'd, Women of
tolerable Understanding, and capable of Instruction; yet they had
not to this Hour taught them anything of the Christian Religion, no,
not so much as to know that there was a God, or a Worship, or in
what Manner God was to be served, or that their own Idolatry, and
worshipping they knew not who was false and absurd.
This, he saia, was an unaccountable Neglect, and what Cod would
certainly call them to Account for, and perhaps at last take the
Work out of their Hands. He spoke this very affectionately and
warmly. I am persuaded, says he, had those Men lived in the savage
Country, whence their Wives came, the Savages would have taken
more Pains to have brought them to be Idolaters, and to worship
the Devil, than any of these Men, so far as he could see, had taken
with them to teach them the Knowledge of the true God. Now, Sir,
taid he, though I do not acknowledge your Religion, or you mine,
yet we should be glad to see the Devil's Servants, and the Subjects of
his Kingdom, taught to know the general Principles of the Christian
Religion; that they might, at least, hear of God, and of a Redeemer,
and of the Resurrection, and of a future State, Things which we all
believe; they had at least been so much nearer coming into the
Bosom of the true Church, than they are now in the public Profession
of Idolatry and Devil-Worship.
I could hold no longer; I took him in my Arms, and embrac'd
him with an Excess of Passion: How far, said I to him, have I been
from understanding the most essential Part of a Christian (viz.) to
love the Interest of the Christian Church, and the good of other
Men's Souls. I scarce have known what belongs to being a Christian.
O, Sir, do not say so, reply'd he, this Thing is not your Fault: No,
says I, but why did I never lay it to Heart as well as you? 'Tis not
too late yet, said he, be not too forward to condemn yourself: But
what can be done now, said I, you see I am going away? Will you
give me Leave, said he, to talk with those poor Men about it? Yes,
with all my Heart, said I, and will oblige them to give heed to
what you say too: As to that, said he, we must leave them to the
Mercy of Christ; but it is our Business to assist them, encourage
them, and instruct them; and if you will give me Leave, and God
his Blessing, I do not doubt but the poor ignorant Souls shall be
brought home into the great Circle of Christianity, if not into the
particular Faith that we all embrace, and that even while you stay here;
Upon this, / said, I shall not only give you Leave, but give you a
thousand Thanks for it What follow'd on this Account, I shall
mention also again in its Place.
I now pressed him for the third Article, in which we were to blame.
Why really, says he, it is of the same Nature, and I will proceed,
asking your Leave, with the same Plainness as before; it is aboul
your poor Savages, who are, as I may say, your conquer'd Subjects. It
is a Maxim, Sir, that is or ought to be receiv'd among all Christians of
what Church or pretended Church soever, (viz.) The Christian Know-
ledge ought to be propagated by all ,possible Means, and on all possible
Occasions: It is on this Principle that our Church sends Missionaries
into Persia, India, and China, and that our Clergy, even of the
superior Sort, willingly engage in the most hazardous Voyages, and the
dangerous Residence among Murderers and Barbarians, to teach
them the Knowledge of the true God, and to bring them over to
embrace the Christian Faith. Now, Sir, you have such an Oppor-
tunity here, to have six or seven-and-thirty poor Savages brought
over from Idolatry to the Knowledge of God, their Maker and Re-
deemer, that I wonder how you can pass such an Occasion of doing
Good, which is really worth the Expence of a Man's whole Life.
I was now struck dumb indeed, and had not one Word to say. I
had here a Spirit of true Christian Zeal for God and Religion before
me, let his particular Principles be of what kind soever. As for me,
I had not so much as entertain'd a Thought of this in my Heart
before, and I believe should not have thought of it; for I looked
upon these Savages as Slaves, and People, whom, had we any Work
for them to do, we would have used as such, or would have been
glad to have transported them to any other Part of the World; for
our Business was to get rid of them, and we would all have been
satisfy'd, if they had been sent to any Country, so they had never
seen their own: But to the Case, I say, I was confounded at his
Discourse, and knew not what Answer to make him. He looked
earnestly at me, seeing me in some Disorder; Sir, says he, 1 shall
be very sorry, if what I have said gives you any Offence: No, no,
says I, I am offended with nobody but myself; but I am perfectly
confounded, not only to think that I should never take any Notice
of this before, but with reflecting what Notice I am able to take of
it now. You know, Sir, said I, what Circumstances I am in; I am
bound to the East Indies, in a Ship freighted by Merchants, and to
whom it would be an insufferable Piece of Injustice to detain their
Ship here, the Men lying all this while at Victuals and Wages upon
the Owners' Account It is true, I agreed to be allow'd twelve Days
here, and if I stay more, I must pay 3/. Sterling per Diem Demurrage,
nor can I stay upon Demurrage above eight Days more, and I haw
been here thirteen Days already, so that I am perfectly unable to
engage in this Work, unless I would suffer myself to be left behind
here again, in which Case, if this single Ship should miscarry in any
Part of her Voyage, I should be just in the same Condition that I
was left in here at first, and from which I have been so wonderfully
delivered.
He owned the Case was very hard upon me, as to my Voyage; but
laid it home upon my Conscience, whether the Blessing of saving
seven-and-thirty Souls, was not worth my venturing all I had in the
World for? I was not so sensible of that as he was. I return'd upon
him thus, Why, Sir, it is a valuable Thing, indeed, to be an Instru-
ment in God's Hand to convert seven-and-thirty Heathens to the
Knowledge of Christ, but as you are an Ecclesiastic, and are given
over to the Work, so that it seems so naturally to fall into the Way
of your Profession; how is it, that you do not rather offer yourself to
undertake it, than press me to it?
Upon this he faced about, just before me, as we walked along, and
putting me to a full Stop, made me a very low Bow; I most heartily
thank God and you, Sir, says he, for giving me so evident a Call to so
blessed a Work; and if you think yourself discharg'd from it, and
desire me to undertake it, I will most readily do it, and think it a
happy Reward for all the Hazards and Difficulties of such a broken
disappointed Voyage as I have met with, that I may be dropped at last
into so glorious a Work.
I discover'd a kind of Rapture in his Face while he spoke this to
me; "his Eyes sparkled like Fire, his Face glowed, and his Colour
came and went, as if he had been falling into Fits; in a Word, he
was fired with the Joy of being embark'd in such a Work. I paused
a considerable while before I could tell what to say to him, for I was
really surpris'd to find a Man of such Sincerity and Zeal, and carry'd
out in his Zeal beyond the ordinary Rate of Men, not of his Profes-
sion only, but even of any Profession whatsoever. But after I had
consider'd it awhile, I asked him seriously if he was in earnest, and
that he would venture on the single Consideration of an Attempt on
those poor People, to be locked up in an unplanted Island for, per-
haps, his Life, and at last might not know whether he should be able
to do them any Good, or not?
He turned short upon me, and asked me what I called a Venture?
Pray, Sir, said he, what do you think I consented to go in your Ship
to the East Indies for? May, said I, that I know not, unless it waJ
to preach to the Indians: Doubtless it was, said he; and do you
think, if I can convert these seven-and-thirty Men to the Faith of
Christ, it is not worth my time, though I should never be fetched ofl
the Island again? nay, is it not infinitely of more worth to save so
many Souls, than my Life is, or the Life of twenty more of the same
Profession? Yes, Sir, says he, I would give Christ and the blessed
Virgin Thanks all my Days, if I could be made the least happy In-
strument of saving the Souls of these poor Men, though I was never
to set my Foot off of this Island, or see my native Country any more.
But since you will honour me, says he, with putting me into this Work,
for which I will pray for you all the Days of my Life; I have one
humble Petition to you, said he, besides. What is that ? said I. Why,
says he, it is, that you will leave your Man Friday with me, to be my
Interpreter to them, and to assist me; for without some Help I
cannot speak to them, or they to me.
I was sensibly troubled at his requesting Friday, because I could
not think of parting with him, and that for many Reasons; he had
been the Companion of my Travels; he was not only faithful to me,
but sincerely affectionate to the last Degree, and I had resoh/d to do
something considerable for him, if he out-liv'd me, as it was probable
he would. Then I knew that, as I had bred Friday up to be a Pro-
testant, it would quite confound him to bring him to embrace another
Profession; and he would never, while his Eyes were open, believe
that his old Master was a Heretic and would be damn'd; and this
might in the End ruin the poor Fellow's Principles, and so turn him
to his first Idolatry.
However, a sudden Thought reliev'd me in this Strait, and it was
this; I told him, I could not say that I was willing to part with
Friday on any Account whatever, though a Work that to him was of
more Value than his Life, ought to be to me of much less Value than
the keeping or parting with a Servant; but on the other hand, I was
persuaded that Friday would by no Means consent to part with me,
and I could not force him to it without his Consent, without manifest
Injustice, because I had promised I would never put him away, and he
had promis'd and engag'd to nie that lie would never leave, me unless
I put him away.
He seemed very much concern'd at it, for he had no rational Access
to these poor People, seeing he did not understand one Word of their
Language, nor they one Word of his: To remove this Difficulty, I
told him, Friday's Father had learned Spanish, which I found he
also understood, and he should serve him for an Interpreter; so he
was much better satisfied, and nothing could persuade him, but he
would stay to endeavour to convert them; but Providence gave
another, and very happy, Turn to all this.
I come back now to the first Part of his Objections. When we
came to the Englishmen, I sent for them all together, and after some
Account given them of what I had done for them, viz. what necessary
Things I had provided for them, and how they were distributed, which
ttiey were very sensible of, and very thankful for; I began to
ialk to them of the scandalous Life they led, and gave them a full
Account of the Notice the Clergyman had already taken of it, and
arguing how unchristian and irreligious a Life it was. I first asked
them if they were married Men or Bachelors? They soon explain'd
their Condition to me, and showed me that two of them were Widow-
ers, and the other three were single Men or Bachelors. I asked them
with what Consciences they could take these Women and lie with
them, as they had done, call them their Wives, and have so many
Children by them, and not be marry'd lawfully to them.
They all gave me the Answer that I expected, viz. that there wa»
nobody to marry them; that they agreed before the Governor to keep
them as their Wives; and to keep them and own them as their Wives;
and they thought as Things stood with them, they were as legally married
as if they had been married by a Parson, and with all the Formalities in
the World.
I told them, that no doubt they were married in the Sight of God,
and were bound in Conscience to keep them as their Wives, but that
the Laws of Men being otherwise, they might pretend they were not
married, and so desert the poor Women and Children hereafter; and
>hat their Wives being poor desolate Women, friendless and money-
less, would have no way to help themselves. I therefore told them,
that unless I was assur'd of their honest Intent, I could do nothing
for them; but would take Care that what I did should be for the
Women and their Children without them, and that unless they
would give some Assurances that they would marry the Women, I
could not think it was convenient they should continue together as
Man and Wife, for that it was both scandalous to Men, and offensive to
God, who they could not think would bless them, if they went on thus.
All tnis went on as I expected, and they told me, especially Will
4tkins, who seemed now to speak for the rest, that they loved theli
Wives as well as if they had been bor n in their own Native Country,
and would not leave them upon any Account whatever; and they did
verily believe their Wives were as virtuous and as modest, and did, to
the utmost of their Skill, as much for them, and for their Children, as
any Women could possibly do, and they would not part with them on
any Account: And Will Atkins for his own particular added, if any
Man would take him away, and offer to carry him home to England,
and make him Captain of the best Man of War in the Navy, he would
not go with him, if he might not carry his Wife and Children with
him; and if there was a Clergyman in the Ship, he would be married
to her now with all his Heart
This was just as I would have it; the Priest was not with me at
that Moment, but was not far off: So to try him farther, I told him I
had a Clergyman with me, and if he was sincere, I would have him
married the next Morning, and bid him consider of it, and talk
with the rest; he said, as for himself, he need not consider of it at
all, for he was very ready to do it, and was glad I had a Minister with
me, and he believ'd they would be all willing also. I then told him
that my Friend the Minister was a Frenchman, and could not speak
English, but that I would act the Clerk between them: He never so
much as asked me whether he was Papist or Protestant, which was
indeed what I was afraid of: But, I say, they never inquir'd about it
So we parted, I went back to my Clergyman, and Will Atkins went
in to talk to his Companions. I desir'd the French Gentleman not to
say anything to them, till the Business was thorough ripe, and I told
him what Answer the Men had given me.
Before I went from their Quarter, they all came to me, and told
me, they had been considering what I had said, that they were very
glad to hear I had a Clergyman in my Company, and they were
very willing to give me the Satisfaction I desir'd, and to be formally
Married as soon as I pleased, for they were far from desiring to part
with their Wives, and that they meant nothing but what was very
honest when they chose them; so I appointed them to meet me the
next Morning, and that in the meantime they should let their Wives
know the meaning of the Marriage-Law; and that it was not only to
prevent any Scandal, but also to oblige them, that they should not
forsake them, whatever might happen.
The Women were easily made sensible of the Meaning of the
Thing, and were very well satisfied with it, as, indeed, they had
Reason to be; so they failed not to attend all together at my Apart-
ment the next Morning, where I brought out my Clergyman; and
though he had not on a Minister's Gown, after the Manner of England,
or the Habit of a Priest, after the Manner of France; yet having a
black Vest something like a Cassock, with a Sash round it, he did
not look very unlike a Minister; and as for his Language, I was his
Interpreter.
But the Seriousness of his Behaviour to them, and the Scruples he
made of marrying the Women, because they were not baptiz'd, and
profess'd Christians, gave them an exceeding Reverence for his
Person; and there was no need after that, to inquire whether he was
a Clergyman or no.
Indeed, I was afraid his Scruple would have been carry'd so far, as
that he would not have marry'd them at all; nay, notwithstanding all
I was able to say to him, he resisted me, though modestly, yet very
steadily, and at last refused absolutely to marry them, unless he had
first talked with the Men, and the Women too; and though at first I
was a little backward to it, yet at last I agreed to it with a good Will,
perceiving the Sincerity of his Design.
When he came to them, he let them know, that I had acquainted
him with their Circumstances, and with the present Design: That he
was very willing to perform that Part of his Function, and marry
them as I had desir'd; but that before he could do it, he must take
the Liberty to talk with them. He told them, That in the Sight of
all indifferent Men, and in the Sense of the Laws of Society, they
had lived all this while in an open Adultery; and that it was true,
that nothing but the Consenting to marry, or effectually separating
them from one another now, could put an End to it; but there was
a Difficulty in it too, with respect to the Laws of Christian Matri-
mony, which he was not fully satisfy'd about, viz. That of marrying
one that is a professed Christian, to a Savage, an Idolater, and a
Heathen, one that is not baptiz'd; and yet that he did not see that
there was Time left for it to endeavour to persuade the Women to be bap-
tiz'd, or to profess the Name of Christ, whom they had, he doubted,
heard nothing of, and without which they could not be baptiz'd.
He told them, He doubted they were but indifferent Christians
themselves; that they had but little Knowledge of God, or of his
Ways; and therefore he could not expect that they had said much
CD their Wives on that Head yet; but that unless they would promise
him to use their Endeavours with their Wives, to persuade them to
become Christians, and would as well as they could instruct them in
the Knowledge and Belief of God that made them, and to worship
Jesus Christ that redeem'd them, he could not marry them; for h«
would have no Hand in joining Christians with Savages; nor was it
consistent with the Principles of the Christian Religion; and wa>
indeed expressly forbidden in God's Law.
They heard all this very attentively, and I deliver'd it very faith-
fully to them, from his Mouth, as near his own Words as I could,
only sometimes adding something of my own to convince them how
just it was, and how I was of his Mind; and I always very faithfully
distinguish'd between what L said from myself, and what were the
Clergyman's Words. They told me, it was very true, what the Gen
tleman had said, that they were but very indifferent Christians them-
selves, and that they had never talked to their Wives about Religion.
Lord, Sir! says Will Atkins, How should we teach them Religion?
Why, we know nothing ourselves; and besides, Sir, said he, should
we go to talk to them of God, and. Jesus Christ, and Heaven and Hell,
'twould be to make them laugh at us, and ask us, What we believe
ourselves? And if we should tell them we believe all the Things
that we speak of to them, such as of good People going to Heaven,
and wicked People to the Devil, they would ask us, Where we intend
to go ourselves, that we believe all this, and are such wicked Fellows,
as we indeed are? Why, Sir, it is enough to give them a Surfeit of
Religion at first Hearing: Folks must have some Religion them-
selves, before they pretend to teach other People. Will Atkins,
said I to him, though I am afraid what you say has too much Truth
in it, yet can you not tell your Wife that she's in the wrong? That
there is a God and a Religion better than her own; that her Gods
are Idols, that they can neither hear nor speak; that there is a great
Being that made all Things, and that can destroy all that he had
made; that he rewards the Good, and punishes the Bad; and that
we are to be judged by him at last for all we do here: You are not
so ignorant, but even Nature itself will teach you that all this is true,
and I am satisfy'd you know it all to be true, and believe it yourself.
That's true, Sir, said Atkins; but with what Face can I say an)'
thing to my Wife of all this, when she will tell me immediately it
cannot be true?
Not tnie! said I. What do you mean by that? Why, Sir, said
he, She will tell de it cannot be true, that this God I shall tell her of
can be just, or can punish, or reward, since I am not punish'd, and
sent to the Devil, that have been such a wicked Creature as she
knows I have been, even to her, and to everybody else; and that I
should be suffer'd to live, that have been always acting so contrary
to what I must tell her is Good, and to what I ought to have done.
Why, truly, Atkins, said I, I am afraid thou speakest too much
Truth; and with that I let the Clergyman know what Atkins had
said, for he was impatient to know: 0I said the Priest, tell hin?
there is one Thing will make him the best Minister in the World to
his Wife, and that is, Repentance; for none teach Repentance like
true Penitents: he wants nothing but to repent, and then he will be
so much the better qualify'd to instruct his Wife: He will be then
able to tell her, that there is not only a God, and that he is the just
Rewarder of Good and Evil, but that he is a merciful Being, and with
infinite Goodness and Long-suffering forbears to punish those that
offend, waiting to be gracious, and willing not the Death of a Sinner,
but rather that he should return and live; that oftentimes suffers
kicked Men to go on a long Time, and even reserves Damnation to
the general Day of Retribution. That it is a clear Evidence of God,
and of a future State, that righteous Men receive not their Reward,
or wicked Men their Punishment, till they come into anothei
World; and this will lead him to teach his Wife the Doctrine of the
Resurrection, and of the last Judgment; let him but repent for him-
self, he will be an excellent Preacher of Repentance to his Wife.
I repeated all this to Atkins, who looked very serious all the while,
and who, we could easily perceive, was more than ordinarily affected
»'ith it: When being eager, and hardly suffering me to make an End,
/ know all this, Master, says he, and a great deal more; but I haven't
the Impudence to talk thus to my Wife, when God, and my own
Conscience knows, and my Wife will be an undeniable Evidence
against me, that I have lived, as if I had never heard of a God, or
future State, or anything about it; and to talk of my repenting,
ALAS! And with that he fetched a deep Sigh; and I could see, that
Tears stood in his Eyes : Tis past all that with me. Past it! ATKINS,
said I, What dost thou mean by that? I know well enough what I
mean, says he, / mean 'tis too late, and that is too true.
1 told my Clergyman Word for Word what he said. The poor
IK
zealous Priest (I must call him so; for, be his Opinion what it will,
he had certainly a most singular Affection for the Good of other Men's
Souls; and it would be hard to think he had not the like for his own)
I say, this zealous, affectionate Man, could not refrain Tears also : But,
recovering himself, he said to me, Ask him but one Question, Is he
easy that it is too late, or is he troubled, and wishes it were not so?
I put the Question fairly to Atkins, and he answered with a great deal
of Passion, How could any Man be easy in a Condition that certainly
must end in eternal Destruction? That he was far from easy, but
that, on the contrary, he believ'd it would one Time or other
ruin him.
What do you mean by that? said I. Why, he said he believ'd he
should, one Time or other, cut his Throat to put an End to the
Terror of it
The Clergyman shook his Head with a great Concern in his Face,
when I told him all this: But turning quick to me upon it, says he,
Tf that be his Case, you may assure him it is not too late; Christ
will give him Repentance: But pray, says he, explain this to him,
That as no Man is saved but by Christ and the Merit of his Passion,
procuring divine Mercy for him, how can it be too late for any Man
to receive Mercy? Does he think he is able to sin beyond the
Power or Reach of divine Mercy? Pray tell him, there may be a
time when provok'd Mercy will no longer strive, and when God may
refuse to hear, but that it is never too late for Men to ask Mercy; and
we that are Christ's Servants are commanded to preach Mercy at all
times, in the Name of Jesus Christ, to all those that sincerely repent;
so that it is never too late to repent
I told Atkins all this, and he heard me with great Earnestness; but
it seemed as if he turned off the Discourse to the rest; for he said to
me he would go and have some Talk with his Wife; so he went out
awhile, and we talked to the rest I perceiv'd they were all stupidly
ignorant as to Matters of Religion, much as I was when I went
rambling away from my Father; and yet that there were none of
them backward to hear what had been said; and all of them seriously
promis'd that they would talk with their Wives about it, and do their
Endeavour to persuade them to turn Christians.
The Clergyman smiled upon me, when I reported what Answer
they gave, but said nothing a good while; but, at last, shaking hij
Head, We that are Christ's Servants, says he, can go no further than
(0 exhort and instruct, and when Men comply, submit to the
Reproof, and promise what we ask 'tis all we can do; we are
bound to accept their good Words: But believe me, Sir, said he,
whatever you may have known of the Life of that Man you call
Will Atkins, I believe he is the only sincere Convert among them;
I take that Man to be a true Penitent; I wont despair of the rest;
but that Man is apparently struck with the Sense of his past Life;
aud I doubt not, but when he comes to talk Religion to his Wife, he
will talk himself effectually into it; for attempting to teach others, is
sometimes the best way of teaching ourselves. I knew a Man, who
having nothing but a summary Notion of Religion himself, and being
wicked and profligate to the last Degree in his Life, made a
thorough Reformation in himself, by labouring to convert a Jew.
If that poor Atkins begins but once to talk seriously of Jesus Christ
to his Wife, my Life for it, he talks himself into a thorough Convert,
makes himself a Penitent: And who knows what may follow?
Upon this Discourse however, and their promising, as above,
to endeavour to persuade their Wives to embrace Christianity, ha
marry'd the other three Couple; but Will Atkins and his Wife were
not yet come in. After this, my Clergyman, waiting awhile, was
curious to know where Atkins was gone; and, turning to me, says he,
I entreat you, Sir, let us walk out of your Labyrinth here, and look;
I dare say, we shall find this poor Man somewhere or other talking
seriously to his Wife, and teaching her already something of Religion.
I began to be of the same Mind; so we went out together, and I
carry'd him a Way which none knew but myself, and where the Trees
were so thick set, as that it was not easy to see through the Thicket
of Leaves, and far harder to see in, than to see out; when, coming to
the Edge of the Wood, I saw Atkins and his tawny Savage Wife
sitting under the Shade of a Bush, very eager in Discourse; I
stopped short till my Clergyman came up to me; and then having
showed him where they were, we stood and looked very steadily at
them a good while.
We observ'd him very earnest with her, pointing up to the Sun,
and to every Quarter of the Heavens, then down to the Earth, then
out to the Sea, then to himself, then to her, to the Woods, to the
Trees. Now, says my Clergyman, you see my Words are made good,
the Man preaches to her; mark him now, he is telling her, that our
pod has made hiw, and her, and the Heavens, the Earth- the Sea, the
Woods, the Trees, &*c. I believe he is, said I; immediately we
perceiv'd Will Atkins start up upon his Feet, fall down on hi?
Knees, and lift up both his Hands: We suppose he said something,
6ut we could not hear him, it was too far for that; he did not con-
tinue kneeling half a Minute, but comes and sits down again by his
Wife, and talks to her again. We perceiv'd then the Woman very
attentive, but whether she said anything or no we could not tell;
while the poor Fellow was upon his Knees, I could see the Tears
run plentifully down my Clergyman's Cheeks, and I could hardly
forbear myself; but it was a great Affliction to us both that we
were not near enough to hear anything that passed between them.
Well, however, we could come no nearer for fear of disturbing
them, so we resoh/d to see an End of this Piece of still Conversation,
and it spoke loud enough to us without the Help of Voice. He sat
down again, as I have said, close by her, and talked again earnestly
to her, and two or three times we could see him embrace her most
passionately; another time we saw him take out his Handkerchief
and wipe her Eyes, and then kiss her again with a kind of Transport
very unusual; and after several of these Things we see him, on a
sudden, jump up again and lend her his hand to help her up, when
immediately, leading her by the Hand a Step or two, they both
kneeled down together, and continu'd so about two Minutes.
My Friend could bear it no longer, but cries out aloud, St PAUL
St PAUL! behold he prayeth; I was afraid Atkins would hear him,
therefore I entreated him to withhold himself awhile, that we might
see an End of the Scene, which to me, I must confess, was the most
affecting, and yet the most agreeable that ever I saw in my Life:
Well, he strove with himself and contain'd himself for a while, but
was in such Raptures of Joy, to think that the poor Heathen Woman
was become a Christian, that he was not able to contain himself;
he wept several times, then throwing up his Hands and crossing his
Breast, said over several Things Ejaculatory and by way of giving
God Thanks for so miraculous a Testimony of the Success of our
Endeavours; some he spokr softly, and I could net well hear,
others audibly, some in La,i.. some in French; then two or three
times the Tears of Joy would ini'Tupt him, that he could not speak
ax all: But I begged that he would compose himself, and let us more
narrowly and fully observe what was before us, which he did for a
Time, and the Scene was not ended there yet; for after the Do^r
Man and his Wife were risen again from their Knees, we observ'd ht
stood talking still eagerly to her; and we observ'd by her Motion,
that she was greatly affected with what he said, by her frequent lifting
up her Hands, laying her Hand to her Breast, and such other
Postures, as usually express the greatest Seriousness and Attention.
This continu'd about half a Quarter of an Hour, and then they walk'd
away too; so that we could see no more of them in that Situation
I took this Interval to talk with my Clergyman: And first, I told
him, I was glad to see the Particulars we had both been Witnesses
to; that though I was hard enough of Belief in such Cases, yet that I
began to think it was all very sincere here, both in the Man and his
Wife, however ignorant they might both be; and I hoped such a
Beginning would have a yet more happy End; and who knows, said
I, but these two may in Time, by Instruction and Example, work
upon some of the others? Some of them! said he, turning quick
upon me, ay, upon all of them; depend upon it, if those two Savages,
for he has been but little better, as you relate it, should embrace
Jesus Christ, they will never leave till they work upon all the rest;
for true Religion is naturally communicative, and he that is once made
a Christian, will never leave a Pagan behind him, if he can help it
I owned it was a most Christian Principle to think so, and a Testi-
mony of a true Zeal, as well as a generous Heart in him: But, my
Friend, said I, will you give me Leave to start one Difficulty here?
I cannot tell how to object the least Thing against that affectionate
Concern, which you show for the turning the poor People from their
Paganism to the Christian Religion: But how does this comfort you,
while these People are in your Account out of the Pale of the Catho-
lic Church, without which you believe there is no Salvation; so that
you esteem these but Heretics, and for other Reasons as effectually
lost as the Pagans themselves.
To this he answer'd with abundance of Candour and Christian
Charity thus; Sir, I am a Catholic of the Roman Church, and a
Priest of the Order of St Benedict, and I embrace all the Principles
of the Roman Faith: But yet if you will believe me, and that I do not
speak in Compliment to you, or in respect to my Circumstances and your
Civilities; I say, nevertheless, I do not look upon you, who call
yourselves Reform'd, without some Charity: I dare not say, though 1
know it is our Opinion in general; I say, I dare not say that you
cannot he saved: I will by no means limit the Mercy of Christ so
far, as to think that he cannot receive you into the Bosom of his
Church in a Manner to us unperceivable, and which it is impossible
for us to know, and I hope you have the same Charity for us. I
pray daily for your being restored to Christ's Church, by whatsoever
Methods he, who is All-wise, is pleased to direct: In the meantime,
sure you will allow it to consist with me, as a Roman, to distinguish
far between a Protestant and a Pagan; between one that calls on
Jesus Christ, though in a Way which I do not think is according to
the true Faith, and a Savage, a Barbarian, that knows no God, no
Christ, no Redeemer; and if you are not within the Pale of the
Catholic Church, we hope you are nearer being restor'd to it than
those that know nothing of God or his Church: And I rejoice there-
fore when I see this poor Man, who you say has been a Profligate,
and almost a Murderer, kneel down and pray to Jesus Christ, as we
suppose he did, though not fully enlighten'd; believing that God,
from whom every such Work proceeds, will sensibly touch his Heart,
<uid bring him to the further Knowledge of that Truth in his own
Time; and if God shall influence this poor Man to convert and in-
struct the ignorant Savage his Wife, I can never believe that he
shall be cast away himself; and have I not Reason then to rejoice,
the nearer any are brought to the Knowledge of Christ, though they
may not be brought quite home into the Bosom of the Catholic
Church, just at the time when I may desire it? leaving it to the
Goodness of Christ to perfect his Work in his own time, and his
own way. Certainly I would rejoice if all the Savages in America
were brought like this poor Woman to pray to God, though they were
to be all Protestants at first, rather than they should continue Pagans
and Heathens; firmly believing, that he that had bestow'd the first
Light to them, would further illuminate them with a Beam of his
heavenly Grace, and bring them into the Pale of his Church when he
should see good.
I was astonish'd at the Sincerity and Temper of this truly pious
Papist, as much as I was oppress'd by the power of his Reasoning;
and it presently occurr'd to my Thoughts, that if such a Temper was
universal, we might be all Catholic Christians, whatever Church or
particular Profession we joined to, or joined in; that a Spirit of
Charity would soon work us all up into right Principles; and in a
Word, as he thought that the like Charity would make us all Catholics,
so I told him I believed, had all the Members of his Church the like
Moderation, they would soon be all Protestants. And there we left
that Part, for we never disputed at all.
However, I talked to him another Way, and taking him by the
Hand, My Friend, says I, I wish all the Clergy of the Roman Church
were blest with such Moderation, and had an equal Share of your
Charity. I am entirely of your Opinion; but I must tell you, that if
you should preach such Doctrine in Spain or Italy, they would put
you into the Inquisition.
It may be so, said he, I know not what they might do in Spain or
Italy, but I will not say they would be the better Christians for that
Severity, for I am sure there is no Heresy in too much Charity.
Well, as Will Atkins and his Wife were gone, our Business there
was over; so we went back our own Way; and when wf came back,
we found them waiting to be called in; observing this, I asked my
Clergyman if we should discover to him that we had seen him under
the Bush, or no; and it was his Opinion we should not; but that
we should talk to him first, and hear what he would say to us; so
we called him in alone, nobody being in the Place but ourselves; and
I began with him thus:
Will Atkins, said I, prithee what Education had you? What was
your Father?
W. A. A better Man than ever I shall be. Sir, my Father was
a Clergyman.
R. C. What Education did he give you?
W. A. He would have taught me well, Sir; but I despis'd all
Education, Instruction or Correction, like a Beast as I was.
R. C. It's true, Solomon says, He that despises Reproof is brutish.
W. A. Ay, Sir, I was brutish, indeed, I murder'd my Father; for
God's sake, Sir, talk no more about that, Sir; I murder'd my pooi
Father.
Pr. Ha! a Murderer !*
• Here the Priest started (for I interpreted every Word as he
spoke it) and looked pale. It seems he believ'd that Will had
really killed his own Father.
R. C. No, no, sir, I do not understand him so; Will Atkins^
explain yourself, you did not kill your Father, did you, with your
own Hands?
ADVENTURES OF
W. A. No, Sir, I did not cut his Throat, but I cut the Thread of all
his Comforts, and shorten'd his Days; I broke his Heart by Ihe most
ungrateful, unnatural Return, for the most tender affectionate Treat-
ment that ever Father gave, or Child could receive.
R. C. Well, I did not ask you about your Father to extort this
Confession; I pray God give you Repentance for it, and forgive you
that, and all your other Sins; but I asked you, because I see, that
though you have not much Learning, yet you are not so ignorant as
some are in Things that are Good; that you have known more of
Religion a great deal than you have practised.
W. A. Though you, Sir, did not extort the Confession that I make
about my Father, Conscience does; and whenever we come to look
back upon our Lives, the Sins against our indulgent Parents are cer-
tainly the first that touch us; the Wounds they make lie the deepest,
and the Weight they leave will lie heaviest upon the Mind, of all the
Sins we can commit
R. C. You talk too feelingly and sensibly for me, Atkins; I
cannot bear it
W. A. You bear it, Master! I daresay you know nothing of it
R. C. Yes, Atkins, every Shore, every Hill, nay, I may say, every
Tree in this Island is witness to the Anguish of my Soul, for my In-
gratitude and base Usage of a good tender Father; a Father much
like yours, by your Description; and I murder'd my Father as well as
you, Will Atkins; but I think, for all that, my Repentance is short
of yours too* by a great deal
• / would have said more, if I could have restrain'd my
Passions; but I thought this poor Man's Repentance was so
much sincerer than mine, that I was going to leave off the
Discourse and retire, for I was surpriid with what he said;
and thought, that instead of my going about to teach and in-
struct him, the Man was made a Teacher and Instructor to
me, in a most surprising and unexpected Manner.
I laid all this before the young Clergyman, who was greatly
tffected with it, and said to me, Did I not say, Sir, that when this
Man was converted, he would preach to us all? I tell you,
Sir, if this one Man be made a true Penitent, here will be no
need of me; he will make Christians of all in the Island. But
having a little compos'd myself, I renew'd my Discourse with Will
Atkins.
But, WILL, said 7, How comes the Sense of this Matter to touch
you just now?
W. A. Sir, you have set me about a Work that has struck a Dart
through my very Soul; I have been talking about God and Religion
to my Wife, in order, as you directed me, to make a Christian of her,
and she has preached such a Sermon to me, as I shall never forget
while I live.
R. C. No, no, it is not your Wife has preached to you; but when
you were moving religious Arguments to her, Conscience has flung
them back upon you.
W. A. Ay, Sir, with such a Force as is not to be resisted.
R. C. Pray Will let us know what passed between you and your
Wife, for I know something of it already.
W. A. Sir, it is impossible to give you a full Account of it; I am
too full to hold it, and yet have no Tongue to express; but let her
have said what she will, and though I cannot give you an Account of
it, this I can tell you of it, that I resolve to amend and reform my
Life.
R. C. But tell us some of it How did you begin, Will? For
this has been an extraordinary Case, that's certain. She has preached
a Sermon, indeed, if she has wrought this upon you.
W. A. Why, I first told her the Nature of our Laws about Mar-
riage, and what the Reasons were, that Men and Women were
oblig'd to enter into such Compacts, as it was neither in the Power
of one or other to break; that otherwise, Order and Justice could
not be maintain'd, and Men would run from their Wives, and
abandon their Children, mix confusedly with one another, and
neither Families be kept entire, or Inheritances be settled by legal
Descent
R. C. You talk like a Civilian, Will; could you make her un-
derstand what you meant by Inheritance and Families? They know
no such Thing among the Savages, but marry anyhow, without Re-
gard to Relation, Consanguinity, or Family; Brother and Sister; nay,
as I have been told, even the Father and Daughter, and Son and th«
M other.
W. A. I believe, Sir, you are misinform'd, and my Wife assures me
of the contrary, and that they abhor it; perhaps, for any farther Rela-
tions they may not be so exact as we are. But she tells me they
never touch one another in the near Relations you speak of.
R. C. Well, what did she say to what you told her?
W. A. She said, she lik'd it very well, and it was much better
than in her Country.
R. C. But did you tell her what Marriage was?
W. A. Ay, ay, there began all our Dialogue. I asked her if she
would be marry'd to me our Way? She asked me what Way that was I
I told her Marriage was appointed by God; and here we had a
strange Talk together, indeed, as ever Man and Wife had I believe.
N.B. This Dialogue between W. Atkins and his Wife, as I took
it down in Writing, just after he told it me, was as follows.
Wife. Appointed by your God! Why, have you a God in your
Country?
W. A. Yes, my Dear, God is in every Country.
Wife. No, you God in my Country; my Country have the great
old Benamuckee God.
W. A. Child, I am very unfit to show you who God is; God is
in Heaven, and made the Heaven and the Earth, the Sea, and all
that in them is.
Wife. No makee de Earth; no, you God make all Earth, no make
my Country.*
* W. A. laughed a little at her Expression of God not making her
Country.
Wife. No laugh, why laugh me? This no Thing to Laugh.*
* He was justly reprov'd by his Wife, for she was more serious
than he at first.
W. A. That's true indeed, I will not laugh any more my Dear.
Wife. Why you say, you God make all?
W. A. Yes, Child, our God made the whole World, and you, and
I, and all Things; for he is the only true God, there is no God but
nim, he lives for ever in Heaven.
Wife Why you no tell me lonr ago'
W. A. That's true indeed, but I have been a wicked Wretch, and
have not only forgotten to acquaint thee with anything before, but
have lived without God in the World myself.
Wife. What have you de great God in you Country, you no
know him? No say O to him? No do good Thing for him? That
no possible!
W. A. It is too true; though for all that, we live as if there was no
God in Heaven, or that he had no Power on Earth.
Wife. But why, God let you do so? Why he no makee you good
live?
W. A. It is all our own Fault
Wife. But you say me, he is Great, much Great, have much great
Power; can makee kill, when he will; why he no makee kill when
you no serve him? No say O to him? No be good Mans?
W. A. That is true; he might strike me dead, and I ought to
expect it, for I have been a wicked Wretch, that is true; but God
is merciful, and does not deal with us as we deserve.
Wife. But then, do not you tell God Tankee for that too?
W. A. No, indeed, I have not thanked God for his Mercy, any
more than I have feared God for his Power.
Wife. Then you God no God; me no think, believe, he be such
one, great much Power, strong; no makee kill you though you
makee him much Angry.
W. A. What? Will my wicked Life hinder you from believing in
God! What a dreadful Creature r.m I; and what a sad Truth is
it, that the horrid Lives of Christians hinder the Conversions of
Heathens!
Wife. How me tink you have great much God • up there, and yet
no do well, no do good Thing? Can he tell? Sure he no tell what
you do?
* She points up to Heaven.
W. A. Yes, res, he knows and sees all Things; he hears us
ROBINSON CRUSOE. 393
speak.
Wife. What! he no hear you swear, curse, speak the great Damn
W. A. Yes, yes, he hears it all.
Wife. Where be then the muchee great Power strong?
W. A. He is merciful, that's all we can say for it; and this proves
him to be the true God; he is God and not Man; and therefore w»
are not consum'd.*
* Here Will Atkins told us he was struck with Horror, to think
how he could tell his Wife so clearly that God sees, and hearsx
and knows the secret Thoughts of the Heart, and all that we do;
and yet that he had dar'd to do all the vile Things he had done.
Wife. Merciful! what you call that?
W. A. He is our Father and Maker, and he pities and spares us.
Wife. So then he never makee kill, never angry when you do
wicked; then he no good himself, or no great able.
W. A. Yes, yes, my Dear, he is infinitely good, and infinitely great,
and able to punish too, and sometimes to show his Justice and
Vengeance, he lets fly his Anger to destroy Sinners, and make
Examples; many are cut off" in their Sins.
Wife. But no make kill you yet, then he tell you may be that he
no make you kill, so you make de Bargain with him, you do bad
Thing, he no be angry at you, when he be angry at other Mans.
W. A. No indeed, my Sins are all Presumptions upon his Good-
ness; and he would be infinitely just if he destroy'd me as he has
done other Men.
Wife. Well, and yet no kill, no makee you dead, what you say to
him for that, you no tell him Tankee for all that too?
W. A. I am an unthankful, ungrateful Dog, that's true.
Wife. Why? He no makee you much good better; you say he
makee you.
W. A. He made me as he made all the World; 'tis I have do
form'd myself, and abus'd his Goodness, and made myself an
abominable Wretch.
Wife. I wish you makee God know me; I no ::>.akee him angry, I
no do bad wicked Thing.
Here Will Atkins said his Heart sunk within him, to hear apoot
untaught Creature desire to be taught to know God, and he such
a wicked Wretch, that he could not say one Word to her about
God, but what the Reproach of his own Carriage would make
most irrational to her to believe; nay, that already she had told
him, that she could not believe in God, because he that was so
wicked was not destroy'd
>V. A. My Dear, you mean, you wish I could teach you to know
God, not God to know you; for he knows you already, and every
Thought in your Heart.
Wife. Why then he know what I say to you now? He know xaz
wish to know him; how shall me know who makee me?
W. A. Poor Creature, he must teach thee, I cannot teach thee;
I'll pray to him to teach thee to know him, and to forgive me that I
am unworthy to teach thee.
The poor Fellow was in such an Agony at her desiring him to
make her know God, and her wishing to know him, that, he
said, he fell down on his Knees before her, and prayed to God
to enlighten her Mind with the saving Knowledge of Jesus
Christ, and to pardon his Sins, and accept of his being the un-
worthy Instrument of instructing her in the Principles oj
Religion; after which he sat down by her again, and their
Dialogue went on. N.B. This was the Time when we saw
him kneel down, and lift up his Hands.
Wife. What you put down the Knee for? What you hold up the
Hand for? What you say? Who you speak to? What is all that?
W. A. My Dear, I bow my Knees in Token of my Submission to
him that made me; I said O to him, as you call it, and as you say
your old Men do to their Idol Benamuckee; that is, I prayed to him.
Wife. What you say 0 to him for?
W. A. I prayed to him to open your Eyes, and your Understand-
ing, that you may know him, and be accepted by him.
Wife. Can he do that too?
W. A. Yes, he can, he can do all Things.
Wife, But now he hear what you say?
W. A. Yes, he has bid us pray to him, and promis'd to hear us.
Wife. Bid you pray? When he bid you? How he bid you?
What! you hear him speak?
W. A. No; we do not hear him speak, but he has reveal'd him-
self many Ways to us.
Here he was at a great Loss to make her understand, that God hat
rrjeaTd himself to us by his Word, and what his Word was:
But at last he told it her thus. ..
W. A. God has spoken to some good Men in former Days, even
from Heaven, by plain Words; and God has inspir'd good Men by
his Spirit; and they have written all his Laws down in a Book.
Wife. Me no understand that; where is Book?
W. A. Alas, my poor Creature, I have not this Book; but I hope
I shall one Time or other get it for you, and help you to read it
Here he embrac'd her with great Affection; but with Inexpressible
Grief, that he had not a Bible.
Wife. But how you makee me know, that God teachee them to
write that Book?
W. A. By the same Rule that we know him to be God.
Wife. What Rule, what Way you know him?
W. A. Because he teaches and commands nothing but what is
good, righteous, and holy; and tends to make us perfectly good, as
well as perfectly happy; and because he forbids and commands us
to avoid all that is wicked, that is evil in itself, or evil in its
Consequences.
Wife. That me would understand, that me fain see; if he teachee
all good Thing, forbid all wicked Thing, he reward all good Thing,
punish all wicked Thing, he make all Thing, he give all Thing; he
hear me when I say O to him, as you go do just now; he makee me
good, if I wish be good; he spare me, no makee kill me, when I no
be good; all this you say he do, yet he be great God; me take,
think, believe him be great God; me say O to him too with you, my
Dear.
Here the poor Man could forbear no longer; but raising her up,
made her kneel by him, and he prayed to God aloud to instruct hex
in the Knowledge of himself by his Spirit, and that by some good
Providence, if possible, she might some time or other come to have a
Bible, that she might read the Word of God, and be taught by it to
know him.
This was the Time that we saw him lift her up by the hand, and
saw him kneel down by her, as above.
They had several other Discourses it seems after this, too long to
set down here; and particularly she made him promise, that since he
confess'd his own Life had been a wicked abominable Course or
Provocation against God, that he would reform it- and not »^ake God
angTy any more, lest he should make him dead, as she called it, and
then she should be left alone, and never be taught to know this God
better; and lest he should be miserable, as he had told her wicked
Men should be after Death.
This was a strange Account, and very affecting to us both, but
particularly to the young Clergyman; he was indeed wonderfully sur-
pris'd with it, but under the greatest Affliction imaginable, that he
could not talk to her, that he could not speak English to make her
understand him; and as she spoke but very broken English, he could
not understand her; However he turned himself to me, and told me,
that he believ'd there must be more to do with this Woman than to
marry her: I did not understand him at first, but at length he ex-
plain'd himself, (viz.) that she ought to be Baptiz'd.
I agreed with him in that Part readily, and was for going about it
presently: No, no, hold Sir, said he, though I would have her be Bap-
tiz'd by all Means, yet I must observe, that Will Atkins, her Husband,
has indeed brought her in a wonderful Manner to be willing to
embrace a religious Life, and has given her just Ideas of the Being
of a God, of his Power, Justice, Mercy; yet I desire to know of him,
if he had said anything to her of Jesus Christ, and of the Salvation of
Sinners, of the Nature of Faith in him, and Redemption by him, of
the Holy Spirit, the Resurrection, the last Judgment, and a future
State.
I called Will Atkins again, and asked him; but the poor Fellow
fell immediately into Tears, and told us he had said something to her
of all those things, but that he was himself so wicked a Creature, and
his own Conscience so reproach'd him with his horrid ungodly Life,
that he trembled at the Apprehensions, that her Knowledge of him
should lessen the Attention she should give to those Things, and
make her rather contemn Religion than receive it: But he was assur'd,
he said, that her Mind was so dispos'd to receive due Impressions of
all those Things, that if I would but discourse with her, she would
make it appear to my Satisfaction, that my Labour would not be lost
upon her.
Accordingly I called her in, and placing myself as Interpreter be
tween my religious Priest and the Woman, I entreated him to begin
with her; but sure such a Sermon was never preached by a Popish
Priest in these latter Ages of the World; and, as I told him, I thought
he had all the Zeal, all the Knowledge, all the Sincerity of a Chris-
tian, without the Error of a Roman Catholic; and that I took him to
he such a Clergyman, as the Roman Bishops were before the Church
of Rome assum'd spiritual Sovereignty over the Consciences of Men.
In a word, he brought the poor Woman to embrace the Know-
ledge of Christ, and of Redemption by him, not with Wonder and
Astonishment only, as she did the first Notions of a God, but with
Joy and Faith, with an Affection and a surprising Degree of Under-
standing, scarce to be imagin'd, much less to be express'd; and at
her own Request she was Baptiz'd.
When he was preparing to Baptize her, I entreated him that he
would perform that Office with some Caution, that the Man might
not perceive he was of the Roman Church, if possible, because of
other ill Consequences which might attend a Difference among us in
that very Religion, which we were instructing the other in: He told
me, that as he had no consecrated Chapel, no proper Things for the
Office, I should see he would do it in a Manner that I should not
know by it, that he was a Roman Catholic myself, if I had not known
it before: And so he did; for saying only some Words over to him-
self in Latin, which I could not understand, he poured a whole
Dishful of Water upon the Woman's Head, pronouncing in French,
very loud, MARY, which was the Name her Husband dcsir'd me to
give her; for I was her Godfather, I Baptize thee in the Name of the
Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost; so that none could
know anything by it, what Religion he was of: He gave the Bene-
diction afterwards in Latin; but either Will Atkins did not know but
it was in French, or else did not take Notice of it at that time.
As soon as this was over we married them; and after the Marriage
was over he turned himself to Will Atkins, and in a very affectionate
Manner exhorted him, not only to persevere in that good Disposition
he was in, but to support the Convictions that were upon him by a
Resolution to reform his Life; told him it was in vain to say he re-
pented, if he did not forsake his Crimes: Represented to him, how
God had honour'd him with being the Instrument of bringing his
Wife to the Knowledge of the Christian Religion, and that he should
be careful he did not dishonour the Grace of God, and that if he did,
he would see the Heathen a better Christian than himself, the Savage
converted, and the Instrument cast away.
He said a great many good Things to them both, and then recom-
mending them in a few Words to God's Goodness, gave them the
Benediction again, I repeating everything to them in English, and
thus ended the Ceremony. I think it was the most pleasant, agree-
able Day to me that ever I passed in my whole Life.
But my Clergyman had not done yet; his Thoughts hung con-
tinually upon the Conversion of the seven and thirty Savages, and
fain he would have stayed upon the island to have undertaken it; but
I convinc'd him, first, that his Undertaking was impracticable in
itself; and secondly, that perhaps 1" would put it into a Way of being
done in his Absence to his Satisfaction; of which, by and by.
Having thus brought the Affair of the Island to a narrow Compass,
I was preparing to go on board the Ship, when the young Man whom
I had taken out of the famish'd Ship's Company, came to me, and told
me, he understood I had a Clergyman with me, and that I had caused
the Englishmen to be married to the Savages, whom they called
Wives; that he had a Match too, which he desir'd might be finish'd
before I went, between two Christians, which he hoped would not be
disagreeable to me.
I knew this must be the young Woman who was his Mother's
Servant, for there was no other Christian Woman on the Island; so I
began to persuade him not to do anything of that Kind rashly, or
because he found himself in this solitary Circumstance : I represented
to him that he had some considerable Substance in the World, and
good Friends, as I understood by himself, and by his Maid also;
that the Maid was not only poor, and a Servant, but was unequal to
him, she being six or seven and twenty Years old, and he not above
seventeen or eighteen; that he might very probabiy, with my
Assistance, make a remove from this Wilderness, ana come into his
own Country again, and that then it would be a thousand to one but
he would repent his Choice; and the Dislike of that Circumstance
might be disadvantageous to both: I was going to say more, but hf
interrupted me, smiling, and told me, with a great deal of Modesty,
that I mistook in my Guesses, that he had nothing of that Kind in
his Thoughts, his present Circumstance being melancholy and dis-
consolate enough; and he was very glad to hear that I had Thoughts
of putting them in a Way to see their Country again, and nothing
should have put him upon staying there, but that the Voyage I was
going was so exceeding long and hazardous, and would carry mm
quite out of the Reach of all his Friends; that he had nothing 10
desire of me, but that I would settle him in some little Properry in
the Island where he was, give him a Servant or two and some few
Necessaries, and he would settle himself here like a Planter, waiting
the good Time, when, if ever I return'd to England, I would redeem
him, and hoped I would not be unmindful of him when I came into
England; that he would give me some Letters to his Friends in
London, to let them know how good I had been to him, and in what
Part of the World, and what Circumstance I had left him in; that
he promised me, that whenever I redeemed him, the Plantation, and
all the Improvement he had made upon it, let the Value be what it
would, should be wholly mine.
His Discourse was very prettily deliver'd, considering his Youth, and
was themore agreeable to me, because he told me positively the Match
was not for himself: I gave him all possible Assurances, that if I livec*
to come safe to England, I would deliver his Letters and do his Busi-
ness effectually, and that he might depend I would never forget the
Circumstance I had left him in; but still I was impatient to know
who was the Person to be married, upon which he told me it was
my Jack of all Trades, and his Maid Susan.
I was most agreeably surpris'd, when he named the Match, for
indeed I thought it very suitable; the Character of that Man I have
given already; and as for the Maid, she was a very honest, modest,
sober and religious young Woman, had a very good Share of Sense,
was agreeable enough in her Person, spoke very handsomely and to
the purpose, always with Decency and good Manners, and not back-
ward to speak when anything required it, or impertinently forward
to speak when it was not her Business; very handy and housewifely
in anything that was before her; an excellent Manager, and fit
indeed to have been Governess to the whole Island; she knew very
well how to behave to ail kind of Folks she had about her, and to
better, if she had found any there.
The Match being proposed in this Manner, we married them the
same Day, and as I was Father at the Altar, as I may say, and gave
her away, so I gave her a Portion; for I appointed her and her
Husband a handsome large Space of Ground for their Plantation;
and indeed this Match and the Proposal the young Gentleman made
to give him a small Property in the Island, put me upon par-
celling it out amongst them, that they might not quarrel afterwards
ibout their Situation.
This Sharing out the Land to them I left to Will Atkins, who
indeed was now grown a most sober, grave, managing Fellow, per-
fectly reform'd, exceeding Pious and Religious, and as far as I may be
allow'd to speak positively in such a Case, I verily believe, was a true
sincere Penitent
He divided Things so justly, and so much to every one's Satisfac-
tion, that they only desired one general Writing under my Hand for
the whole, which I caused to be drawn up and signed and sealed to
them, setting out the Bounds and Situation of every Man's Planta-
tion, and testifying that I gave them thereby severally a Right to the
whole Possession and Inheritance of the respective Plantations or
Farms, with their Improvements to them and their Heirs, reserving
all the rest of the Island as my own Property, and a certain Rent for
every particular Plantation after eleven Years, if I, or any one from
me, or in my Name, came to demand it, producing an attested Copy
of the same Writing.
As to the Government and Laws among them, I told them I was
not capable of giving them better Rules, than they were able to give
themselves, only made them promise me to live in Love and good
Neighbourhood with one another; and so I prepared to leave them.
One Thing I must not omit, and this is, that being now settled in a
Kind of Commonwealth among themselves, and having much Business
in Hand, it was but odd to have seven and thirty Indians live in a
Nook of the Island, independent, and indeed unemployed; for ex-
cepting the providing themselves Food, which they had Difficulty
enough in too, sometimes, they had no manner of Business or Pro-
perty to manage; I propos'd therefore to the Governor Spaniard,
that he should go to them with Friday's Father, and propose to them
to remove, and either plant for themselves, or take them into their
several Families as Servants to be maintain'd for their Labour, but
without being absolute Slaves, for I would not admit them to make
them Slaves by Force by any Means, because they had their Liberty
given them by Capitulation, and as it were Articles of Surrender,
which they ought not to break.
They most willingly embrac'd the Proposal, and came all very
cheerfully along with him; so we allotted them Land, and Planta-
tions, which three or four accepted of, but all the rest chose to be
employ'd as Servants in the several Families we had settled; and
thus my Colony was in a Manner settled as follows: The Spaniards
possess'd my original Habitation, which was the Capital City, and
extended their Plantations all along the side of the Brook, which
made the Creek that I have so often describ'd, as far as my Bower;
and as they increas'd their Culture, it went always Eastward; the
English lived in the North-East Part, where W. Atkins, and his
Comrades began, and came on Southward, and South-West, towards
the back Part of the Spaniards, and every Plantation had a great
Addition of Land to take in, if they found Occasion, so that they
need not jostle one another for want of Room.
All the East End of the Island was left uninhabited, that if any
of the Savages should come on Shore there, only for their usual cus-
tomary Barbarities, they might come and go, if they disturb'd no-
body, nobody would disturb them; and no doubt but they were often
ashore, and went away again, for I never heard that the Planters were
ever attack'd or disturb'd any more.
It now came into my Thoughts, that I had hinted to my Friend
the Clergyman, that the Work of converting the Savages might
perhaps be set on Foot in his Absence, to his Satisfaction; and I told
him that now I thought it was put in a fair Way; for the Savages
being thus divided among the Christians, if they would but every one
of them do their part with those which came under their Hands, I
hoped it might have a very good Effect
He agreed presently in that, if, said he, they will do their Part;
out how, says he, shall we obtain that of them? I told him, we
would call them all together, and leave it in Charge with them, or go
to them one by one, which he thought best; so we divided it; he to
speak to the Spaniards, who were all Papists, and I to the English,
who were all Protestants; and we recommended it earnestly to them,
and made them promise, that they never would make any Distinction
of Papist or Protestant, in their exhorting the Savages to turn
Christians; but teach them the general Knowledge of the true God,
and of their Saviour Jesus Christ; and they likewise promis'd us, that
they would never have any Differences or Disputes one with another
about Religion.
When I came to W. Atkins's House, I may call it so, for such a
House, or such a piece of Basket-Work, I believe, was not standing
in the World again; I say, when I came there, I found the young
Woman I have mention'd above, and Will Atkins's Wife, were
become Intimates; and this prudent religious young Woman had per-
fected the Work Will Atkins had begun; and though it was not
above four Days after what I have related, yet the new baptiz'd
Savage Woman was made such a Christian, as I have seldom heard
of any like her in all my Observation, or Conversation, in the World,
It came next into my Mind in the Morning before I went to them,
that amongst all the needful Things I had to leave with them, I had
not left them a Bible, in which I showed myself less considering for
them, than my good Friend the Widow was for me, when she sent me
the Cargo of an hundred Pounds from Lisbon, where she packed up
three Bibles and a Prayer-book: However, the good Woman's
Charity had a greater Extent than ever she imagin'd; for they were
reserv'd for the Comfort and Instruction of those, that made much
better Use of them than I had done.
I took one of the Bibles in my Pocket, and when I came to Will
Atkins's Tent or House, and found the young Woman, and Atkins's
baptiz'd Wife, had been discoursing of Religion together; for Will
Atkins told it me, with a great deal of Joy: I asked if they were
together now, and he said, yes; so I went into the House, and he,
with me, and we found them together very earnest in Discourse; O
Sir, says Will Atkins, when God has Sinners to reconcile to himself,
and Aliens to bring Home, he never wants a Messenger; my Wife
has got a new Instructor; I knew I was unworthy, as I was unca-
pable of that Work; That young Woman has been.sent hither from
Heaven; she is enough to convert a whole Island of Savages; the
young Woman blushed, and rose up to go away, but I desir'd her to
sit still; I told her, she had a good Work upon her Hands, and I
hoped God would bless her in it
We talked a little, and I did not perceive thev had any Book
among them, though I did not ask; but I put my Hand in my
Pocket, and pulled out my Bible; here, says I, to Atkins, I have
brought you an Assistant that perhaps you had not before; the
Man was so confounded, that he was not able to speak for some Time;
but recovering himself, he takes it with both his Hands, and turning
to his Wife, here, my Dear, says he; did not I tell you, our God,
though he lives above, could hear what we said? Here's the Book I
prayed for, when you and I kneeled down under the Bush; now God
has heard us, and sent it; when he had said so, the Man fell into
such Transports of a passionate Joy, that between the Joy of having
it, and giving God Thanks for it, the Tears run down his Face like a
Child that was crying.
The Woman was surprised, and was like to have run into a Mistake
that none of us were aware of; for she firmly believ'd God had sent
the Book upon her Husband's Petition; It is true, that providentially
it was so, and might be taken so in a consequent Sense; but I
believ'd, it would have been no difficult Matter at that Time, to have
persuaded the poor Woman to have believ'd that an express Mes-
senger came from Heaven, on Purpose to bring that individual Book;
but it was too serious a matter, to suffer any Delusion to take Place;
so I turned to the young Woman and told her we did not desire to
impose upon the new Convert, in her first, and more ignorant Under-
standing of Things; and begged her to explain to her that God may
be very properly said to answer our Petitions, when in the Course of
his Providence, such Things are in a particular Manner brought to
pass, as we petition'd for; but we do not expect Returns from
Heaven, in a miraculous and particular Manner, and that it is our
Mercy that it is not so.
This the young Woman did afterwards effectually; so that there
was I assure you, no Priestcraft used here; and I should have
thought it one of the most unjustifiable Frauds in the World, to have
had it so; but the Surprize of Joy upon Will Atkins, is really not to
be expressed; and there we may be sure, there was no Delusion:
Sure, no Man was ever more thankful in the World for anything of
its Kind, than he was for this Bible; nor I believe, never any Man
was glad of a Bible from a better Principle: and though he had been
a most profligate Creature, desperate, headstrong, outrageous, furious,
and wicked to a great Degree; yet this Man is a standing Rule to us
»11, for the well instructing Children, (viz.) that Parents should never
give over to teach and instruct, or ever despair of the Success of
their Endeavours, let the Children be ever so obstinate, refractory, or
to Appearance, insensible of Instruction; for if ever God in his Pro-
vidence, touches the Consciences of such, the Force of their Educa-
tion returns upon them, and the early Instruction of Parents is not
lost; though it may have been many Years laid asleep; but some
Time or other, they may find the Benefit of it
Thus it was with this poor Man; However ignorant he was, or
divested of Religion and Christian Knowledge: He found he had
some to do with now, more ignorant than himself; and that the least
Part of the Instruction of his good Father that could now come to
his Mind, was of Use to him.
Among the rest it occurr'd to him, he said, how his Father used
to insist much upon the inexpressible Value of the Bible; the Privilege
and Blessing of it to Nations, Families, and Persons; but he never
entertain'd the least Notion of the Worth of it, till now; when being
to talk to Heathens, Savages, and Barbarians, he wanted the Help of
the written Oracle for his Assistance.
The young Woman was very glad of it also for the present Occa-
sion, though she had one, and so had the Youth on board our Ship
among their Goods, which were not yet brought on Shore; and now
having said so many Things of this young Woman, I cannot omit
telling one Story more of her, and myself, which has something in it
very informing and remarkable.
I have related, to what Extremity the poor young Woman was re-
duced; how her Mistress was starved to Death, and did die on board
that unhappy Ship we met at Sea; and how the whole Ship's Com-
pany being reduc'd to the last Extremity; the Gentlewoman, and her
Son, and this Maid, were first hardly used as to Provisions; and at
last totally neglected and starv'd; that is to say, brought to the last
Extremity of Hunger.
One Day being discoursing with her upon the Extremities
they suffer'd, I asked her if she could describe by what she
had felt, what it was to starve, and how it appear'd; she told
me, she believ'd she could; and she told her Tale very distinctly
thus:
"First, Sir, said she, we had for some Days fared exceeding hard,
"and suffer'd very great Hunger; but now at last, we were wholly
"without Food of any Kind, except Sugar, and a little Wine, and a
"little Water. The first Day, after I had receiv'd no Food at all, I
"found myself towards Evening, first empty and sickish at my Stomach,
"and nearer Night mightily inclin'd to yawning and sleepy; I laid
"down on a Couch in the great Cabin to sleep, and slept about three
"Hours, and awak'd a little refresh'd; having taken a Glass of Wine
"when I lay down; after being about three Hours awake, it being
"about five o'Clock in the Morning, I found myself empty and my
"Stomach sickish, and laid down again, but could not sleep at all,
"being very faint, and ill; and thus I continu'd all the second Day,
"with a strange Variety, first hungry, then sick again, with retchings
"to Vomit; the second Night hieing oblig'd to go to Bed again,
"without any Food, more than a Draught of fair Water; and being
"asleep, I dream'd I was at Barbadoes, and that the Market wa»
"mightily stocked with Provisions; that I bought some for my
* Mistress, and went and dined very heartily.
"I thought my Stomach was as full after this as any would havo
"been after, or at a good Dinner; but when I waked, I was exceed-
"ingly sunk in my Spirits, to find myself in the Extremity of Famine:
"The last Glass of Wine we had, I drank, and put Sugar in it, be-
"cause, of its having some Spirit to supply Nourishment; but there
"being no Substance in the Stomach for the digesting Office to work
"upon, I found the only Effect of the Wine was, to raise disagreeable
'' Fumes from the Stomach, into the Head; and I lay, as they told
"me, stupid, and senseless, as one drunk for some Time.
"The third Day in the Morning, after a Night of strange and con-
"fus'd inconsistent Dreams ; and rather dozing than sleeping, I waked,
"ravenous and furious with Hunger; and I question, had not my
"Understanding return'd and conquer'd it—I say, I question whether
"if I had been a Mother, and had had a little Child with me, its Life
"would have been safe or not
"This lasted about three Hours; during which Time I was twice
"raging mad as any Creature in Bedlam, as my young Master told me,
"and as he can now inform you.
"In one of these Fits of Lunacy or Distraction, whether by the
"Motion of the Ship, or some Slip of my Foot, I know not; I fell
"down, and struck my Face against the Corner of a Pallet Bed in
"which my Mistress lay; and with the Blow the Blood gush'd out of
"my Nose; and the Cabin Boy bringing me a little Bason, I sat
"down and bled into it a great deal; and as the Blood run from me,
"I came to myself; and the Violence of the Flame or the Fever, I
"was in, abated, and so did the ravenous Part of the Hunger.
"Then I gTew sick, and retched to vomit, but could not; for I had
"nothing in my Stomach to bring up: After I had bled some Time,
u I swooned, and they all believ'd I was dead; but I came to myself
"soon after, and then had a most dreadful Pain in my Stomach, not
"to be describ'd; not like the Colic, but a gnawing eager Pain fot
"Food; and towards Night it went off with a kind of earnest Wish-
"ing or Longing for Food; something like, as I suppose, the Longing
"of a Woman with Child. I took another Draught of Water with
"Sugar in it, but my Stomach loathed the Sugar, and brought it all up
"again; then I took a Draught of Water without Sugar, and that
"stayed with me; and I laid me down upon the Bed, praying mosl
"heartily, that it would please God to take me away; and composing
"my Mind in Hopes of it, I slumber'd a while, and then waking,
"thought myself dying, being light with Vapours from an empty
"Stomach; I recommended my Soul then to God, and earnestly
"wished that somebody would throw me into the Sea.
"All this while my Mistress lay by me just as I thought expiring,
"but bore it with much more Patience than I, and gave the last Bit
"of Bread she had left to her Child, my young Master, who would
"not have taken it, but she oblig'd him to eat it; and I believe it
"saved his Life.
"Towards the Morning I slept again, and first when I awak'd, I
"fell into a violent Passion of Crying, and after that had a second Fit
"of violent Hunger; I got up ravenous, and in a most dreadful Con-
"dition; had my Mistress been dead, as much as I loved her, I am
"certain, I should have eaten a Piece of her Flesh, with as much Re-
"lish, and as unconcern'd, as ever I did the Flesh of any Creature
"appointed for Food; and once or twice I was going to bite my own
"Arm: At last, I saw the Bason in which was the Blood I had bled
"at my Nose the Day before; I ran to it, and swallow'd it with such
"Haste, and such a greedy Appetite, as if I had wonder'd nobody
"had taken it before, and afraid it should be taken from me now.
"Though after it was down, the Thoughts of it filled me with Horror,
"yet it checked the Fit of Hunger, and I drank a Draught of fair
"Water, and was compos'd and refresh'd for some Hours after it:
"This was the 4th Day, and thus I held it, till towards Night, when
"within the Compass of three Hours, I had all these several Circum-
"stances over again, one after another, (viz.) sick, sleepy, eagerly
"hungry, Pain in the Stomach, then ravenous again, then sick again,
"then lunatic, then crying, then ravenous again; and so every
"quarter of an Hour, and my Strength wasted exceedingly: At
"Night I laid me down, having no Comfort, but in the Hope that I
"should die before Morning.
"All this Night I had no Sleep; but the Hunger was now
"turned into a Disease; and I had a terrible Colic and Griping, by
"Wind instead of Food, having found its Way into the Bowels; and
"in this Condition I lay till Morning, when I was surpriz'd a tittle
"with the Cries and Lamentations of my young Master, who called
"out to me that his Mother was dead 3 I lifted myself up a little; for
"I had not Strength to rise, but found she was not dead, though she
"was able to give very little Signs of life.
"I had then such Convulsions in my Stomach, for want of some
"sustenance, that I cannot describe; with such frequent Throws and
"Pangs of Appetite, that nothing but the Tortures of Death can
"imitate; and in this condition I was when I heard the Seamen
"above cry out a Sail, a Sail, and halloo and jump about, as if they
"were distracted.
"I was not able to get off from the Bed, and my Mistress much
"less; and my young Master was so sick, that I thought he had been
"expiring; so we could not open the Cabin Door, or get any Account
"what it was that occasion'd such a Combustion, nor had we had
"any Conversation with the Ship's Company for two Days; they
"having told us, that they had not a Mouthful of anything to eat in the
"Ship; and they told us afterwards, they thought we had been dead.
"It was this dreadful Condition we were in when you were sent to
"save our Lives; and how you found us, Sir, you know as well as I,
"and better too."
This was her own Relation, and in such a distinct Account of
Starving to Death, as I confess, I never met with, and was exceeding
entertaining to me; I am the rather apt to believe it to be a true
Account, because the Youth gave me an Account of a good Part of
it; though I must own, not so distinct and so feelingly as his Maid;
and the rather, because it seems his Mother fed him at the Price of
her own Life: But the poor Maid, though her Constitution being
stronger than that of her Mistress, who was in Years, and a weakly
Woman too, she might struggle harder with it; I say, the poor Maid
might be supposed to feel the Extremity something sooner than her
Mistress, who might be allowed to keep the last Bit something longer
than she parted with any to relieve the Maid. No Question, as the
Case is here related, if our Ship, or some other, had not so provi-
dentially met them, a few Days more would have ended all their
Lives, unless they had prevented it by eating one another; and even
that as their Case stood would have served them but a little while,
they being 500 Leagues from any Land, or any Possibility of Relief,
other than in the miraculous Manner it happen'd: But this is by the
Way; I return to my Disposition of Things among the People.
And, First, It is to be observ'd here, That for many Reasons I did
not think fit to let them know anything of the Sloop I had framed
and which I thought of setting up among them; for I found, at least
at my first coming, such Seeds of Divisions among them, that I saw it
plainly had I set up the Sloop, and left it among them, they would
upon every light Disgust have separated, and gone away from one
another, or perhaps have turned Pirates, and so made the Island a
Den of Thieves, instead of a Plantation of sober and religious People
so as I intended it; nor did I leave the two Pieces of Brass Cannon
that I had on Board, or the two Quarter-Deck Guns, that my Nephew
took extraordinarily for the same Reason: I thought it was enough
to qualify them for a defensive War against any that should invade
them; but not to set them up for an offensive War, or to encourage
them to go Abroad to attack others, which in the End would only
bring Ruin and Destruction upon themselves and all their Under-
taking: I reserved the Sloop therefore, and the Guns, for theii
Service anc'Aer Way, as I shall observe in its Place.
I have flow done with the Island: I left them all in good Circum-
stances, and in a flourishing Condition, and went on board my Ship
again the 5th of May, having been five-and-twenty Days among
them; and as they were all resoh/d to stay upon the Island till I
came to remove them, I promis'd to send some further Relief from
the Brasils, if I could possibly find an Opportunity; and particu-
larly I promis'd to send them some Cattle, such as Sheep, Hogs, and
Cows: For as to the two Cows and Calves which I brought from
England, we had been oblig'd by the Length of our Voyage to kill
them at Sea, for want of Hay to feed them.
The next Day, giving them a Salute of five Guns at parting, we set
sail, and arriv'd at the Bay of All-Saints in the Brasils in about 23
Days, meeting nothing remarkable in our Passage, but this, That
about three Days after we sailed, being becalm'd, and the Current
setting strong to the E.N.E., running, as it were, into a Bay or Gulf
on the Land Side, we were driven something out of our Course, and
once or twice our Men cried Land to the Eastward; but whether it
was the Continent or Islands, we could not tell by any Means.
But the third Day towards Evening, the Sea smooth, and the
Weather calm, we saw the Sea, as it were, cover'd towards the Land
with something very black, not being able to discover what it was,
till after some Time, our chief Mate going up the main Shrouds a
little Way, and looking at them with a Perspective, cried out it was
an Army. I could not imagine what he meant by an Army, and
spoke a little hastily, calling the Fellow a Fool, or some <rtich Word:
Nay, Sir, says he, don't be angry, for 'tis an Army and a Fleet too;
for I believe there are a thousand Canoes, and you may see them
paddle along, and they are coming towards us too, apace.
I was a little suqms'd then indeed, and so was my Nephew, the
Captain; for he had heard such terrible Stories of them in the Island,
and having never been in those Seas before, that he could not tell
what to think of it, but said two or three Times, we should all be
devour'd. I must confess considering we were becalm'd, and the
Current set strong towards the Shore, I liked it the worse: However,
I bad him not be afraid, but bring the Ship to an Anchor, as soon as
we came so near to know that we must engage them.
The Weather continu'd calm, and they came on apace towards us;
30 I gave Order to come to an Anchor, and furl all our Sails: As for
the Savages, I told them they had nothing to fear but Fire; and
therefore they should get their Boats out, and fasten them, one close
by the Head, and the other by the Stern, and man them both well,
and wait the Issue in that Posture: This I did, that the Men in the
Boats might be ready with Skeets and Buckets to put out any Fire
these Savages might endeavour to fix to the Outside of the Ship.
In this Posture we lay by for them, and in a little while they came
up with us; but never was such a horrid Sight seen by Christians:
My Mate was much mistaken in his Calculation of their Number, I
mean of a thousand Canoes ; the most we could make of them when
they came up, being about a hundred and six-and-twenty; and a
great many of them too; for some of them had sixteen or seventeen
Men in them, and some more; and the least six or seven.
When they came nearer to us they seemed to be struck with
Wonder and Astonishment, as at a Sight which they had doubtless
never seen before; nor could they at first, as we afterwards under-
stood, know what to make of us: They came boldly up however
very near to us, and seemed to go about to row round us; but we
called to our Men in the Boats, not to let them come too near them.
This very Order brought us to an Engagement with them, without
our designing it; for five or six of their large Canoes came so near
our Long-Boat, that our Men beckon'd with their Hands to them to
keep back, which they understood very well, and went back; but at
their Retreat, about 50 Arrows came on board us from those Boats'
and one of our Men in the Lon^-Boat was very much wounded.
However, I called to them not to fire by any Means; but we handed
down some Deal-Boards into the Boat, and the Carpenter presently
set up a kind of a Fence, like waste Boards, to cover them from the
Arrows of the Savages, if they should shoot again.
About half an Hour afterwards they came all up in a Body aster
n
of us, and pretty near us, so near that we could easily discern what
they were, though we could not tell their Design : And I easily found
they were some of my old Friends, the same Sort of Savages that I
had been used to engage with; and in a little Time more they rowed
a little farther out to Sea, till they came directly Broad-side with us,
and then rowed down straight upon us, till they came so near, that they
could hear us speak: Upon this I order'd all my Men to keep close,
lest they should shoot any more Arrows, and made all our Guns
ready; but being so near as to be within hearing, I made Friday go
out upon the Deck, and call out aloud to them in his Language to know
what they meant, which accordingly he did ; whether they understood
him or not, that I knew not: But as soon as he had called to them, six
of them, who were in the foremost or nighest Boat to us, turns their
Canoes from us; and stooping down, showed us their naked Backsides,
just as if in English, saving your Presence, they had bid us kiss;
whether this was a Defiance or Challenge, we know not; or whether
it was done in mere Contempt, or as a Signal to the rest; but imme-
diately Friday cried out they were going to shoot, and unhappily for
him, poor Fellow, they let fly about 300 of their Arrows, and, to my
inexpressible Grief, kill'd poor Friday, no other Man being in their
Sight The poor Fellow was shot with no less than three Arrows,
and about three more fell very near him; such unlucky Marksmen
they were.
I was so enrag'd with the Loss of my old Servant, the Companion
of all my Sorrows and Solitudes, that I immediately order'd five Guns
to be loaded with small Shot, and four with great, and gave them
such a Broad-side, as they had never heard in their Lives before.
to be sure.
They were not above half a Cable Length off when we fired; and
our Gunners took their Aim so well, that three or four of their Canoes
were overset, as we had reason to believe, by one Shot only.
The ill manners of turning up their bare Backsides to us, gave us
no great Offence; neither did I know for certain, whether that which
would pass for the greatest Contempt among us, miKht hr. understood
so by them, or not; therefore in Return, I had only resolv'd to have
fired foui or five Guns at them with Powder only, which I knew
would fright them sufficiently: But when they shot at us directly
with all the Fury they were capable of, and especially as they had
killed my poor Friday, who I so entirely loved and valu'd, and who
indeed so well deserv'd it; I not only had been justify'd before Go<f
and Man, but would have been very glad, if I could, to have overset
every Canoe there, and drown'd every one of them.
I can neither tell, how many we killed, or how many we wounded
at this Broad-side; but sure such a Fright and Hurry never was seen
among such a Multitude; there were 13 or 14. of their Canoes split
and overset in all, and the Men all set a swimming; the rest frighted
out of their Wits, scoured away as fast as they could, taking but little
care to save those whose Boats were split or spoiled with our Shot:
So I suppose that they were many of them lost: And our Men took
up one poor Fellow swimming for his Life, above an Hour after they
were all gone.
Our small Shot from our Cannon must needs kill and wound a
great many; but, in short, we never knew anything how it went
with them; for they fled so fast, that in three Hours or thereabouts,
we could not see above three or four straggling Canoes; nor did we
ever see the rest any more; for a Breeze of Wind springing up the
same Evening, we weighed and set Sail for the Brasils.
We had a Prisoner indeed; but the Creature was so sullen, that he
would neither eat or speak; and we all fancy'd he would starve him-
self to Death: But I took a Way to cure him; for I made them take
him and turn him into the Long-Boat, and make him believe they
would toss him into the Sea again, and so leave him where they found
him, if he would not speak: Nor would that do; but they really did
throw him into the Sea, and came away from him; and then he fol-
low'd them, for he swam like a Cork, and called to them in his
Tongue, though they knew not one Word of what he said: However,
at last they took him in again, and then he began to be more tractable J
nor did I ever design they should drown him.
We were now under Sail again; but I was the most disconsolate
Creature alive, for want of my Man Friday, and would have been
very glad to have gone back to the Island, to have taken one of the
rest from thence for my Occasion, but it could not be; so we went on.
We had one Prisoner, as I have said; and 'twas a long while before
DEATH OF FRIDAY.
we could make him understand anything: But, in time, our Men
taught him some English, and he began to be a little tractable; after-
wards we inquir'd what Country he came from, but could make
nothing of what he said; for his Speech was so odd, all Gutturals, and
spoke in the Throat in such an hollow odd Manner, that we could
never form a Word from him; and we were all of opinion, that they
might speak that Language as well, if they were gagged, as otherwise:
Nor could we perceive that they had any Occasion, either for Teeth,
Tongue, Lips or Palate, but formed their Words, just as a hunting
Horn forms a Tune with an open Throat He told us however, some
time after when we had taught him to speak a little English, that they
were going with their Kings to fight a great Battle. When he said
Kings, we asked him how many Kings? He said, they were FIVE
NATION, we could not make him understand the Plural S. and
that they all joined to go against Two Nation. We asked him, what
made them come up to us? He said, to makce te great Wonder look:
Where it is to be observ'd, That all those Natives, as also those of
Africa, when they lear n English, they always add two E's at the End
of the Words where we use one, and make the Accent upon them, as
makeZ takli, and the like; and we could not break them of it; nay, I
could hardly make Friday leave it off, though at last he did.
And now I name the poor Fellow once more, I must take my last
Leave of him; poor honest Friday I We buried him with all the
Decency and Solemnity possible, by putting him into a Coffin, and
throwing him into the Sea: And I caused them to fire eleven Guns for
him ; and so ended the Life of the most grateful, faithful, honest, and
most affectionate Servant that ever Man had.
We went now away with a fair Wind for Brasil, and in about
twelve Days' Time we made Land in the Latitude of five Degrees
South of the Line, being the North Easternmost Land of all that Part
of America. We kept on S. by E. in Sight of the Shore four Days,
when we made Cape St. Augustine, and in three Days came to an
Anchor off of the Bay of All Saints, the old Place of my Deliverance,
from whence came both my good and evil Fate.
Never Ship came to this Part that had less Business than I had;
and yet it was with great Difficulty that we were admitted to hold the
least Correspondence on Shore; not my Partner himself, who was
alive, and made a great Figure among them; not my two Merchants
Trustees, not the Fame of my wonderful Preservation in that Island,
uu
could obtain me that Favour: But my Partner remembering, that 1
had given 500 Moidores to the Prior of the Monastery of the Augus-
tines, and 272 to the Poor, went to the Monastery, and oblig'd the
Prior that then was, to go to the Governor, and get leave for me per*
sonally, with the Captain and one more besides Eight Seamen, to
come on Shore, and no more; and this upon Condition absolutely
capitulated for, that we should not offer to land any Goods out of the
Ship, or to carry any Person away without Licence.
They were so strict with us, as to landing any Goods, that it was
with extreme Difficulty that I got on Shore three Bales of English
Goods, such as fine Broadcloths, Stuffs, and some Linen which I had
brought for a Present to my Partner.
He was a very generous broad-hearted Man, though like me, he
came from little at first; and though he knew not that I had the least
Design of giving him anything, he sent me on Board a Present of
fresh Provisions, Wine, and Sweetmeats, worth above 30 Moidores,
including some Tobacco, and three or four fine Medals in Gold: But
I was even with him in my Present, which, as I have said, consisted
of fine Broadcloth, English Stuffs, Lace, and fine Hollands: Also I
deliver'd him about the Value of 100 lib. Sterl. in the same Goods
for other Uses; and I oblig'd him to set up the Sloop which I had
brought with me from England, as I have said, for the Use of my
Colony, in order to send the Refreshments I intended to my
Plantation.
Accordingly, he got Hands and finish'd the Sloop in a very few
Days, for she was already framed, and I gave the Master of her such
Instructions, as he could not miss the Place, nor did he miss them, at
I had an Account from my Partner afterwards. I got him soon loaded
with the small Cargo I sent them; and one of our Seamen that had
been on shore with me there, offer'd to go with the Sloop, and settle
there upon my Letter to the Governor Spaniard, to allot him a suffi-
cient Quantity of Land for a Plantation; and giving him some
Clothes, and Tools for his Planting-work, which he said he under-
stood, having been an old Planter at Maryland, and a Buccaneer into
the Bargain.
I encourag'd the Fellow, by granting all he desir'd; and as an
Addition, I gave him the Savage, which we had taken Prisoner of
War, to be his Slave, and order'd the Governor Spaniard to give him
his share of everything he wanted, with the rest
When we came to fit this Man out, my old Partner told me, there
was a certain very honest Fellow, a Brasil Planter of his Acquain-
tance, who had fallen into the Displeasure of Jie Church; I know not
what the matter is with him, says he; but on my Conscience, I think
he is a Heretic in his Heart, and he has been oblig'd to conceal
himself for fear of the Inquisition; that he would be very glad of such
an Opportunity to make his Escape with his Wife and two Daugh-
ters; and if I would let them go to my Island, and allot them a
Plantation, he would give them a small stock to begin with; for the
Officers of the Inquisition had seized all his Effects and Estate, and
he had nothing left but a little Household-stuff and two Slaves. And,
adds he, Though I hate his Principles, yet I would not have him
fall into their Hands; for he would assuredly be burnt alive, if he
does.
I granted this presently, and joined my Englishman with them, and
we conceal'd the Man, and his Wife and Daughters on Board our
Ship, till the Sloop put out to go to Sea; and then (having put all
their Goods on board the Sloop, some time before) we put them on
board the Sloop, after he was got out of the Bay.
Our Seaman was mightily pleased with this new Partner; and their
Stock indeed was much alike, rich in Tools, in Preparations, and a
Farm, but nothing to begin with, but as above: However, they carried
over with them, which was worth all the rest, some Materials for
planting Sugar-canes, with some Plants of Canes; which he, I mean
the Portugal Man, understood very well.
Among the rest of the Supplies sent my Tenants in the Island, I
sent them by their Sloop, three Milch Cows, and five Calves, about
2 2 Hogs among them, three Sows big with Pig, two Mares, and a
Stone-horse.
For my Spaniards, according to my Promise, I engaged three Por-
tugal Women to go, and recommended it to them to marry them, and
nse them kindly. I could have procured more Women, but I re-
tnember'd, that the poor persecuted Man had two Daughters, and
there was but five of the Spaniards that wanted; the rest had Wives
of their own, though in another Country.
All this Cargo arriv'd safe, and as you may easily suppose, very
welcome to my old Inhabitants, who were now with this Addition,
between sixty and seventy People, besides little Children; of which
there was a great many: I found Letters at London from them all by
the Way of Lisbon, when I came back to England: of which I shall
also take some Notice immediately.
I have now done with my Island, and all Manner of Discourse
about it; and whoever reads the rest of my Memorandums, would do
well to turn his Thoughts entirely from it, and expect to read of the
Follies of an old Man, not warn'd by his own Harms, much less by
those of other Men, to beware of the like; not cooled by almost
forty Years' Misery and Disappointments, not satisfy'd with Prosperity
beyond Expectation, not made cautious by Affliction and Distress
beyond Imitation.
I had no more Business to go to the East Indies, than a Man at
full Liberty, and having committed no Crime, has to go to the
Turnkey at Newgate, and desire him to lock him up among the
Prisoners there, and starve him. Had I taken a small Vessel from
England, and went directly to the Island; had I loaded her, as I did
the other Vessel, with all the Necessaries for the Plantation, and for
my People; took a Patent from the Government here, to have secur'd
my Property, in subjection only to that of England; had I carried
over Cannon and Ammunition, Servants and People, to plant, and
taking possession of the Place, fortified and strengthen'd it in the
Name of England, and increas'd it with People, as I might easily
have done; had I then settled myself there, and sent the Ship back,
loaden with good Rice, as I might also have done in six Months'
time, and order'd my Friends to have fitted her out again for our
Supply; had I done this, and stayed there myself, I had, at least, acted
like a Man of common sense; but I was possest with a wandering
Spirit, scorned all Advantages, I pleased myself with being the Patron
of those People I placed there, and doing for them in a kind of
haughty majestic Way, like an old Patriarchal Monarch; providing
for them, as if I had been Father of the whole Family, as well as of
the Plantation: But I never so much as pretended to plant in the
Name of any Government or Nation, or to acknowledge any Prince,
or to call my People Subjects to any one Nation more than another;
nay, I never so much as gave the Place a Name; but left it as I found
it, belonging to no Man; and the People under no Discipline or
Government but my own; who, though I had influence over them as
Father and Benefactor, had no Authority or Power to Act or Command
one way or other, farther than voluntary Consent moved them to
comply; yet even this, had I stayed there, would have done well
enough; but as I rambl'd from them, and came there no more, the
last Letters I had from any of them, was by my Partner's Means;
who afterwards sent another Sloop to the Place, and who sent me
word, though I had not the Letter till five Years after it was written,
that they went on but poorly, were malcontent with their long stay
there: That Will Atkins was dead; That five of the Spaniards were
come away, and that though they had not been much molested by
the Savages, yet they had had some Skirmishes with them; That
they begged of him to write to me, to think of the Promise I had
made, to fetch them away, that they might see their own Country
again before they died.
But I was gone a Wild-Goose Chase indeed; and They who will
have any more of me, must be content to follow me through a new
Variety of Follies, Hardships, and Wild Adventures; wherein the
Justice of Providence may be duly observ'd, and we may see how
easily Heaven can gorge us with our own Desires; make the strongest
of our Wishes be our Affliction, and punish us most severely with
those very Things, which we think, it would be our utmost Happiness
to be allow'd in.
Let no wise Man flatter himself with the Strength of his own
Judgment, as if he was able to choose any particular Station of Life
for himself: Man is a short-sighted Creature, sees but a very little
Way before him; and as his Passions are none of his best Friends, so
his particular Affections are generally his worst Counsellors.
I say this, with Respect to the impetuous Desire I had from a
Youth, to wander into the World; and how evident it now was, that
this Principle was preserv'd in me for my Punishment: How it came
on, the Manner, the Circumstance, and the Conclusion of it, it is
easy to give you Historically, and with its utmost Variety of Particu«
lars: But the secret Ends of Divine Power, in thus permitting us to
be hurried down the Stream of our own Desires, is only to be under*
stood of those who can listen to the Voice of Providence, and draw
religious Consequences from God's Justice, and their own Mistakes.
Be it, I had Business, or no Business, away I went It is no Time
now to enlarge any farther upon the Reason, or Absurdity of my own
Conduct; but to come to the History, I was embark'd for the
Voyage, and the Voyage I went
I should only add here, that my Honest and truly pious Clergyman
left me here: a Ship being ready to ?o to Lisbon, he asked me Leave
to go thither, being still, as he observ'd, bound never to finish any
Voyage he began: How happy had it been for me, if I had gone
with him!
But it was too late now; all things Heaven appoints are best >
had I gone with him, I had never had had so many things to be thank-
ful for, and you had never heard of the second Part of the Travels
and Adventures of Robin. Crusoe; so I must leave here the fruit-
less exclaiming at myself, and go on with my Voyage.
From the Brasils, we made directly away over the Atlantic Sea, to
the Cap! de don Esperance, or as we call it, the Cape of Good Hope;
and had a tolerable good Voyage, our Course generally South-East;
now and then a storm, and some contrary Winds, but my Disasters
at Sea were at an end; my future Rubs and cross Events were to
befal me on shore; that it might appear the Land was as well pre-
par'd to be our scourge as the Sea; when Heaven, who directs the
Circumstances of Things, pleases to appoint it to be so.
Our Ship was on a Trading Voyage, and had a Supercargo on
board, who was to direct all her Motions after she arriv'd at the
Cape; only being limited to certain Numbers of Days, for stay, by
Charter-party, at the several Ports she was to go to: This was none
of my Business, neither did I meddle with it at all; my Nephew, the
Captain, and the Supercargo, adjusting all those things between
them, as they thought fit
We made no stay at the Cape longer than was needful to take in
fresh Water; but made the best of our way for the Coast of Coro-
manJrf. We were, indeed, inform'd that a French Man of War of fifty
Guns, and two large Merchant Ships, were gone for the Indies, and
as I knew we were at War with France, I had some Apprehensions ot
them; but they went their own Way, and we heard no more of them.
I shall not pester my Account, or the Reader, with Descriptions of
Places, Journals of our Voyages, Variations of Compass, Latitudes,
Meridian-Distances, Trade-Winds, Situation of Ports, and the like;
such as almost all the Histories of long Navigation are full of, and
makes the Reading tiresome enough, and are perfectly unprofitable
to all that read it, except only to those who are to go to those Places
themselves.
It is enough to name the Ports and Places which we touched at,
and what occurr'd to us upon our passing from one to another. We
touched first at the Island of Madagascar; where, though the People
4'9
are fierce and treacherous, and in particular very well armed with
Lances and Bows, which they use with inconceivable dexterity; yet
we fared very well with them awhile, they treated us very civilly; and
for some Trifles which we gave them, such as Knives, Scissors, cVv.,
they brought us eleven good fat Bullocks, middling in Size, but very
good in Flesh; which we took in, partly for fresh Provisions for our
present spending, and the rest to Salt for the Ship's Use.
Wc were obliged to stay here some Time after we had furnish'd
ourselves with Provisions; and I, that was always too curious, to look
into every Nook of the World wherever I came, was for going on
Shore as often as I could: it was on the East Side of the Island that
we went on Shore, one Evening; and the People, who by the Way
are very numerous, came thronging about us, and stood gazing at us
at a Distance; but as we had traded freely with them, and had been
kindly used, we thought ourselves in no Danger; but when we saw
the People, we cut three Boughs out of a Tree, and stuck them up
at a Distance from us, which it seems is a Mark in the Country not
only of Truce and Friendship, but when it is accepted, the other Side
set up three Poles or Boughs, which is a Signal that they accept the
Truce too; but then, this is a known Condition of the Truce, that you
axe not to pass beyond their three Poles towards them, nor they to
come past your three Poles or Boughs towards you; so that you are
perfectly secure within the three Poles, and all the Space between
your Poles and theirs, is allow'd like a Market, for free Converse,
Traffic, and Commerce: When you go there, you must not carry
your Weapons with you; and if they come into that Space they
stick up their Javelins and Lances, all at the first Poles, and come on
unarm'd; but if any Violence is offer'd them, and the Truce thereby
broken, away they run to the Poles, and lay hold of their Weapons,
and then the Truce is at an End.
It happen'd one Evening when we went on Shore, that a greater
Number of their People came down than usual, but all was very
friendly and civil, and they brought in several Kinds of Provisions,
for which we satisfied them, with such Toys as we had; their
Women also brought us Milk, and Roots, and several Things
very acceptable to us, and all was quiet; and we made us a
fittle Tent, or Hut, of some Boughs of Trees, and lay on Shore all
Night
I know not what was the Occasion, but I was not so well satisfied
to lie on Shore as the rest, and the Boat lying at an Anchor, about a
Stone cast from the Land, with two Men in her to take care of her ; I
made one of them come on shore, and getting some Boughs of Trees
to cover us also in the Boat, I spread the Sail on the Bottom of the
Boat, and lay under the Cover of the Branches of Trees all Night in
the Boat
About two o'clock in the Morning, we heard one of our Men make
a terrible Noise on the shore, calling out for God's sake to bring the
Boat in, and come and help them, for they were all like to be
murder'd; at the same time I heard the firing of 5 Muskets,
which was the Number of the Guns they had, and that three
times over; for it seems the Natives here were not so easily frighted
with Guns, as the Savages were in America, where I had to do with
them.
All this while I knew not what was the matter; but rousing imme ,
diately from Sleep with the Noise, I caused the Boat to be thrust in,
and resolv'd, with three Fusils we had on board, to land and assist
our Men.
We got the Boat soon to the Shore, but our Men were in too much
Haste: For being come to the shore, they plunged into the Water to
get to the Boat with all the Expedition they could, being pursued by
between three and four hundred Men: our Men were but Nine in
all, and only five of them had Fusils with them; the rest had indeed
Pistols and Swords, but they were of small use to them.
We took up seven of our Men, and with Difficulty enough too, three
of them being very ill wounded; and that which was still worse was,
that while we stood in the Boat to take our Men in, we were in as
much Danger as they were in on Shore; for they poured their Arrows
in upon us so thick that we were fain to barricade the Side of the
Boat up with the Benches, and two or three loose Boards, which to
our great Satisfaction we had by mere Accident or Providence in
the Boat"
And yet, had it been Daylight, they are it seems such exact
Marksmen, that if they could have seen but the least Part of any of
us, they would have been sure of us; we had by the Light of the
Moon a little Sight of them, as they stood pelting us from the Shore
with Darts and Arrows; and having got ready our Fire-arms, we
gave them a Volley, that we could hear by the Cries of some of them,
that wc had wounded several; however, they stood thus in Battle
Array on the Shore till break of Day, which we suppose was, that
they might see the better to take their Aim at us.
In this Condition we lay, and could not tell how to weigh our
Anchor or set up our Sail, because we must needs stand up in the
Boat, and they were as sure to hit us, as we were to hit a Bird in a
Tree with small Shot; we made Signals of Distress to the Ship,
which, though we rode a League off, yet my Nephew the Captain
hearing our Firing, and by Glasses perceiving the Posture we lay in,
and that we fired towards the Shore, pretty well understood us; and
weighing Anchor, with all speed, he stood as near the Shore as he durst
with the Ship, and then sent another Boat with ten Hands in her to
assist us; but we call'd to them not to come too near, telling them
what Condition we were in: However, they stood in nearer to us;
and one of the Men taking the End of a Tow-Line in his Hand, and
keeping our Boat between him and the Enemy, so that they could not
perfectly see him, swam on board us, and made fast the Line to the
Boat; upon which we slipped our little Cable, and leaving oui
Anchor behind, they towed us out of reach of the Arrows, we all the
while lying close behind the Barricado we had made.
As soon as we were got from between the Ship and the Shore, that
she could lay her Side to the Shore, she run along just by them, and we
poured in a Broadside among them loaden with Pieces of Iron and
Lead, small Bullets, and such stuff, besides the great Shot, which
made a terrible Havoc amongst them.
When we were got on board and out of Danger, we had time to
examine into the Occasion of this Fray; and indeed our Supercargo
who had been often in those Parts, put me upon it; for he said, he
was sure the Inhabitants would not have touched us after we had
made a Truce, if we had not done something to provoke them to it
At length it came out (viz.) that an Old Woman who had come to
sell us some Milk, had brought it within our Poles, with a young
Woman with her, who also brought some Roots or Herbs; and
while the Old Woman, whether she was Mother to the young Woman
or no, they could not tell, was selling us the Milk, one of our Men
offer'd some Rudeness to the Wench that was with her, at which the
old Woman made a great Noise: However, the Seaman would not
quit his Prize, but carry'd her out of the old Woman's Sight among
the Trees, it being almost dark; the old Woman went away without
her, and as we suppose, made an Outcry among the People she came
from; who upon Notice, raised this great Army upon us in three
or four Hours; and it was great odds, but we had been all
destroy'd.
One of our Men was kill'd with a Lance thrown at him just at the
beginning of the Attack, as he sally'd out of the Tent they had made;
the rest came off free, all but the Fellow who was the Occasion of all
the Mischief, who paid dear enough for his black Mistress; for we
could not hear what became of him, a great while; we lay upon the
Shore two Days after, though the Wind presented, and made Signals
for him; made our Boat sail up Shore and down Shore, several
Leagues, but in vain; so we were oblig^ to give him over, and if he
alone had suffer'd for it, the Loss had been the less.
I could not satisfy myself, however, without venturing on Shore
once more, to try if I could learn anything of him or them; it was the
third Night after the Action, that I had a great Mind to lear n if I
could by any Means what Mischief we had done, and how the Game
stood on the Indians' Side: I was careful to do it in the Dark, lest
we should be attack'd again; but I ought indeed to have been sure,
that the Men I went with had been under my Command, before I
engag'd in a Thing so hazardous and mischievous as I was brought
into by it, without my Knowledge or Design.
We took twenty stout Fellows with us as any in the Ship, besides
the Supercargo and myself, and we landed two Hours before Mid-
night, at the same Place where the Indians stood drawn up the
Evening before; I landed here, because my Design as I have said,
was chiefly to see if they had quitted the Field, and if they had left
any Marks behind them of the Mischief we had done them; and I
thought, if we could surprise one or two of them, perhaps we might
get our Man again by Way of Exchange.
We landed without any Noise, and divided our Men into two
Bodies, whereof the Boatswain commanded one, and I the other;
we neither saw or heard anybody stir when we landed, and we
marched up one Body at a Distance from the other, to the Place, but
at first could see nothing it being very dark; till by and by, our
Boatswain that led the first Party, stumbled and fell over a Dead
Boy; this made them halt awhile, for knowing by the Circum-
stances that they were at the Place where the Indians had stood, they
waited for my coming up here; we concluded to halt till the Moon
began to rise, which we knew would be in less than an Hour, when
we could easily discern the Havoc we had made among them; we
toid two-and-thirty Bodies upon the Ground, whereof t«vo were not
quite dead: Some had an Arm, and some a Leg shot off, and one
his Head; those that were wounded we suppos'd they had carried
away.
When we had made, as I thought, a full Discovery of all we could
come at the Knowledge of, I was resolv'd for going on board; but
the Boatswain and his Party sent me Word, that they were resolv'd
to make a Visit to the Indian Town, where these Dogs, as they
called them, dwelt, and asked me to go along with them ; and if they
could find them, as still they fancied they should, they did not doubt
getting a good Booty, and it might be, they might find Tho. Jeffry
there, that was the Maris Name we had lost.
Had they sent to ask my Leave to go, I knew well enough what
Answer to have given them; for I would have commanded them
instantly on Board, knowing it was not a Hazard fit for us to run,
who had a Ship, and Ship-loading in our Charge, and a Voyage to
make, which depended very much upon the Lives of the Men; but
as they sent me Word they were resolv'd to go, and only asked me
and my Company to go along with them, I positively refus'd it, an<f
rose up, for I was sitting on the Ground, in Order to go to the Boat;
one or two of the Men began to importune me to go, and when I
refus'd positively, began to grumble, and say they were not under my
Command, and they would go: Come, Jack, says one of the
Men, will go with me? I'll go for one. Jack said he would, and
another followed, and then another; and in a Word, they all left me
but one, who I persuaded to stay, and a Boy left in the Boat; so
the Supercargo and I, with the third Man, went back to the
Boat, where we told them we would stay for them, and take Care to
take in as many of them as should be left; for I told them it was a
mad Thing they were going about, and supposed most of them would
run the Fate of Thorn. Jeffry.
They told me, like Seamen, they'd warrant it they would come off
again, and they would take care, Grc. So away they went; I en-
treated them to consider the Ship and Voyage; that their Lives were
not their own, and that they were entrusted with the Voyage in some
measure; that if they miscarry'd, the Ship might be lost for want of
their Help, and that they could not answer it to God or Man. I said
a great deal more to them on that Head, but I might as well have
talked to the Mainmast of the Ship, they were mad upon their
Journey, only they gave me good Words, and begged I would not be
angry; That they would be very cautious, and they did not doubt
but they would be back again in about an Hour at farthest; for the
Indian Town, they said, was not above half a Mile off, though they
found it above two Miles before they got to it
Well, they all went away, as above; and though the Attempt was
desperate, and such as none but mad Men would have gone about,
yet to give them their due, they went about it warily as boldly:
They were gallantly armed, that's true; for they had every Man a
Fusee or Musket, a Bayonet, every Man a Pistol; some of them
had broad Cutlasses, some of them Hangers, and the Boatswain and
Two more had Pole-Axes: Besides all which, they had among them
Thirteen Hand-Grenadoes. Bolder Fellows, and better provided,
never went about any wicked Work in the World.
When they went out, their chief Design was Plunder, and they were
in mighty hopes of finding Gold there; but a Circumstance which none
of them were aware of, set them on fire with Revenge, and made
Devils of them all. When they came to the few Indian Houses
which they thought had been the Town, which was not above half a
Mile off; they were under a great Disappointment; for there were not
above 12 or 13 Houses; and where the Town was, or how big, they
knew not: They consulted therefore what to do, and were some time
before they could resolve: for if they fell upon these, they must cut
all their Throats, and it was ten to one but some of them might
escape, it being in the Night, though the Moon was up; and if one
escap'd, he would run away, and raise all the Town, so they should
have a whole Army upon them: Again, on the other hand, if they
went away, and left those untouch'd (for the People were all asleep)
they could not tell which Way to look for the Town.
However, the last was the best Advice; so they resolv'd to leave
them, and look for the Town as well as they could . They went on a
little way, and found a Cow tied to a Tree; this they presently con-
cluded, would be a good Guide to them; for they said, the Cow cer-
tainly belonged to the Town before them, or the Town behind them;
and if they untied her, they should see which way she went; if she
went back, they had nothing to say to her; but if she went forward,
they had nothing to do but to follow her: So they cut the Cord, which
was made of twisted Flags, and the Cow went on before them; in a
4*5
Word, the Cow led them directly to the Town, which as they report,
consisted of above 200 Houses or Huts; and in some of these they
found several Families living together.
Here they found all in Silence, as profoundly secure, as Sleep, and a
Country that had never seen an Eneiliy of that Kind could make
them; and first, they called another Council, to consider what they
had to do; and in a Word, they resolv'd to divide themselves into
three Bodies, and to set three Houses on Fire in three Parts of the
Town; and as the Men came out, to seize them and bind them ; if any
resisted, they need not be asked what to do then, and so to search
the rest of the Houses for Plunder; but they resolv'd to marcb
silently first through the Town, and see what Dimensions it was of,
and if they might venture upon it or no.
They did so, and desperately resolv'd that they would venture upon
them; but while they were animating one another to the Work, three
of them that were a little before the rest, called out aloud to them,
and told them they had found Thorn. Jeffry; they all run up to the
Place, and so it was indeed; for there they found the poor Fellow
hanged up naked by one Arm, and his Throat cut; there was an
Indian House just by the Tree, where they found sixteen or seventeen
of the principal Indians who had been concern'd in the Fray with us
before; and two or three of them wounded with our Shot; and our
Men found they were awake, and talking one to another in that
House, but knew not their Number.
The Sight of their poor mangled Comrade so enrag'd them, as before,
that they swore to one another they would be reveng'd, and that
not an Indian who came into their Hands should have Quarter, and
to work they went immediately; and yet not so madly as by the Rage
and Fury they were in might be expected. Their first Care was to
get something that would soon take Fire; but after a little search,
they found that would be to no Purpose; but most of the Houses were
low, and Thatched with Flags or Rushes, of which the Country is full;
so they presently made some wild Fire, as we call it, by wetting a
little Powder in the Palms of their hands, and in a quarter of an
Hour they set the Town on fire in four or five Places; and particu-
larly that House where the Indians were not gone to Bed. As soon
as the Fire began to blaze, the poor frighted Creatures began to rush
out to save their Lives; but met with their Fate in the Attempt, and
especially at the Door, where they drove them baci, the Boatswain
himself killing one or two with his Pole-Axe; the Hoase being
large, and many in it, he did not care to go in, but called for a Hand-
Grenado, and threw it among them, which at first frighted them; but
when it burst, made such Havoc among them, that they cried out i*
a hideous manner.
In short, most of the Indians who were in the open Part of the
House were killed or hurt with the Grenado, except two or three
more who pressed to the Door, which the Boatswain and two more
kept with their Bayonets in the Muzzles of their Pieces, and dispatch'd
all who came that Way. But there was another Apartment in the
House where the Prince or King, or whatever he was, and several
others were, and these they kept in till the House, which was. by this
time all of a light Flame, fell in upon them, and they were smother'd
or burnt together.
All this while they fired not a Gun, because they would not waken
the People faster than they could master them; but the Fire began
to waken them fast enough, and our Fellows were glad to keep a little
together in Bodies, for the Fire grew so raging, all the Houses being
made of light combustible Stuff, that they could hardly bear the
Street between them, and their Business was to follow the Fire for
the surer Execution: As fast as the Fire either forced the People
out of those Houses which were burning, or frighted them out of
others, our People were ready at their Doors to knock them on
the Head, still calling and hallooing to one another to remember
Thorn. Jeftry.
While this was doing, I must confess I was very uneasy, and
especially when I saw the Flames of the Town, which, it being Night,
seemed to be just by me.
My Nephew, the Captain, who was roused by his Men too, seeing
such a Fire, was very uneasy, not knowing what the Matter was, or
what Danger I was in; especially hearing the Guns too; for by this
time they began to use their Fire-Arms; a thousand Thoughts op-
press'd his Mind concerning me and the Supercargo, what should
become of us: And at last, though he could ill spare any more Men,
yet not knowing what Exigence we might be in, he takes another
Boat, and with 13 Men and himself, comes on Shore to me.
He was surpris'd to see me and the Supercargo in the Boat with
no more than two Men; and though he was glad that we were well,
yet he was in the same Impatience with us to know what was doing;
for the Noise continu'd and the Flame increas'd: In short, it was
next to an Impossibility for any Men in the World to restrain their
Curiosity to know what had happen'd, or the Concern for the
Safety of the Men: In a Word, the Captain told me, he would go and
help his Men, let what would come. I argu'd with him as I did
before with the Men, the Safety of the Ship, the Danger of the
Voyage, the Interest of the Owners and Merchants, Grc. and told
him, I would go and the two Men, and only see if we could at a
Distance learn what was like to be the Event, and come back and
tell him.
It was all one, to talk to my Nephew, as it was to talk to the rest
before; he would go he said, and he only wished he had left but Ten
Men in the Ship; for he could not think of having his Men lost for
want of Help; he had rather lose the Ship, the Voyage, and his Life
and all; and away went he.
In a Word, I was no more able to stay behind now, than I was to
persuade them not to go; so in short, the Captain order'd two Men
to row back the Pinnace, and fetch twelve Men more, leaving the
Long-Boat at an Anchor, and that when they came back, six Men
should keep the two Boats, and six more come after us; so that he
left only 16 Men in the Ship; for the whole Ship's Company consisted
of 65 Men, whereof two were lost in the last Quarrel, which brought
this Mischief on.
Being now on the March, you may be sure we felt little of the
Ground we trode on ; and being guided by the Fire, we kept no Path,
Vt went directly to the Place of the Flame: If the Noise of the
Guns was surprising to us before, the Cries of the poor People were
now of quite another Nature, and filled us with Horror. I must
confess, I never was at the sacking a City, or at the taking a Town
by storm. I had heard of Oliver Cromwell taking Xh-ogheda in
Ireland, and killing Man, Woman and Child: And I had read of
Count Tilly, sacking of the City of Magdeburgh, and cutting me Throats
of 22,000 of all Sexes: But I never had an Idea of the Thing itself
before, nor is it possible to describe it, or the Horror which was upon
our Minds at hearing it
However, we went on, and at length came to the Town, though
there was no entering the Streets of it for the Fire. The first Object
we met with was the Ruins of a Hut or House, or rather the Ashes
of it, for the House wa5 'onsum'd; and just before it, plain now to
be seen by the Light of the Fire, lay four Men and three Women
killed; and as we thought, one or two more lay in the Heap among
the Fire. In short there were such Instances of a Rage altogether
barbarous, and of a Fury something beyond what was human, that we
thought it impossible our Men could be guilty of it, or if they were
the Authors of it, we thought they ought to be every one of them put to
the worst of Deaths. But this was not all, we saw the Fire increas'd
forward, and the Cry went on just as the Fire went on; so that we
were in the utmost Confusion. We advanc'd a little Way farther, and
behold, to our Astonishment, three Women naked, and crying in a
most dreadful Manner, come flying, as if they had indeed had Wings,
and after them sixteen or seventeen Men, Natives, in the same Terror
and Consternation, with three of our English Butchers, for I can call
them no better, in their Rear, who, when they could not overtake
them, fired in among them, and one that was killed by their Shot fell
down in our Sight; when the rest saw us, believing us to be their
Enemies, and that we would murder them as well as those that pur-
sued them, they set up a most dreadful Shriek, especially the Women;
and two of them fell down as if already dead with the Fright
My very Soul shrunk within me, and my Blood run chill in my
Veins, when I saw this; and I believe, had the three English Sailors
that pursu'd them come on, I had made our Men kill them all:
However we took some Ways to let the poor flying Creatures know,
that we would not hurt them, and immediately they came up to us,
and kneeling down, with their Hands lifted up, made piteous Lamenta-
tion to us to save them, which we let them know we would; where-
upon they crept all together in a Huddle close behind us, as for
Protection. I left my Men drawn up together, and charged them to
hurt nobody, but if possible to get at some of our People, and see
what Devil it was possess'd them, and what they intended to do ; and
in a word, to command them off, assuring them that if they stayed
till Daylight, they would have an hundred thousand Men about their
Ears: I say, I left them, and went among those flying People, taking
only two of our Men with me; and there was indeed a piteous Spec-
tacle among them: Some of them had their Feet terribly burnt with
trampling and running through the Fire, others their Hands burnt;
one of the Women had fallen down in the Fire, and was very much
burnt before she could get out again, and two or three of the
Men had Cuts in their Backs and Thighs from our Men pur-
string; and another was shot through the Body, and died while I
was there.
I would fain have learned what the Occasion of all this was, but I
could not understand one Word they said; though by Signs I perceived
that some of them knew not what was the Occasion themselves. I
was so terrified in my Thoughts at this outrageous Attempt, that I
could not stay there; but went back to my own Men, and resolVd to
go into the Middle of the Town through the Fire, or whatever might be
in the Way, and put an End to it, cost what it would: Accordingly,
as soon as I came back to my Men, I told them my Resolution, and
commanded them to follow me, when in the very Moment came four
01 our Men with the Boatswain at their Head, roving over the Heaps
of Bodies they had killed, all cover'd with Blood and Dust, as if they
wanted more People to massacre, when our Men halloo'd to them as
\oud as they could halloo, and with much ado one of them made them
near; so that they knew who we were, and came up to us.
As soon as the Boatswain saw us, he set up a Halloo like a Shout
of Triumph, for having, as he thought, more help come, and without
bearing to hear me, Captain, says he, noble Captain, I am glad you
are come; we have not half done yet, villanous Hell-hound Dogs;
I'll kill as many of them as poor Tom has Hairs upon his Head. We
have sworn to spare none of them; we'll root out the very Nation 0/
them from the Earth. And thus he run on, out of Breath too witb
Action, and would not give us leave to speak a Word.
At last raising my Voice, that I might silence him a little, Barba-
rous Dog, said I, what are you doing? I won't have one Creature
touched more, upon pain of Death. I charge you upon your Life, to
stop your Hands, and stand still here, or you are a dead Man this
Minute.
Why, Sir, says he, Do you know what you do, or what they have
done? If you want a Reason for what we have done, come hither; and
with that he showed me the poor Fellow hanging with his Throat cut
I confess, I was urged then myself, and at another time should
have been forward enough; but I thought they had carried their Rage
too far, and thought of Jacob's Words to his Sons Simeon and Levi;
Cursed be their Anger, for it was fierce; and their Wrath, for it wot
cruel: But I had now a new Task upon my hands; for when the
Men I carried with me saw the Sight as I had done, I had as much
to do to restrain them, as I should have had with the other: vzx,
11
my Nephew himself fell in with them, and told me in their hearing
that he was only concern'd for fear of the Men being overpower'd;
for as to the People, he thought not one of them ought to live; for
they had all glutted themselves with the Murder of the poor Man, and
that they ought to be used like Murderers. Upon these Words, away
run eight of my Men with the Boatswain and his Crew, to complete
their bloody Work; and I seeing it quite out of my Power to restrain
them, came away pensive and sad; for I could not bear the Sight,
much less the horrible Noise and Cries of the poor Wretches that fell
into their Hands.
I got nobody to come back with me but the Supercargo and two
Men; and with these I walked back to the Boats. It was a very
great Piece of Folly in me, I confess, to venture back, as it were
alone; for as it began now to be almost Day, and the Alarm had run
over the Country, there stood about 40 Men armed with Lancei
and Bows at the little Place where the 12 or 13 Houses stood men-
tion'd before; but by Accident I missed the Place, and came directly
to the Sea-side, and by the time I got to the Sea-side it was broad
Day; immediately I took the Pinnace, and went aboard, and sent
her back to assist the Men in what might happen.
I observ'd about the Time that I came to the Boat-side, that the
Fire was pretty well out, and the Noise abated; but in about half an
Hour after I got on Board, I heard a Volley of our Men's Fire-arms,
and saw a great Smoke; this, as I understood afterwards, was out
Men falling upon the Men who as I said stood at the few Houses
on the Way, of whom they killed sixteen or seventeen, and set all
those Houses on Fire, but did not meddle with the Women or
Children.
By that Time the Men got to the Shore again with the Pinnace,
our Men began to appear; they came dropping in, some and sorne,
not in two Bodies, and in Form as they went, but all in Heaps,
straggling here and there, in such a Manner, that a small Force of re-
solute Men might have cut them all off.
But the Dread of them was upon the whole Country; and the Men
were amaz'd, and surpris'd, and so frighted, I believe a hundred of
them would have fled at the Sight of but five of our Men. Nor in
All this terrible Action was there a Man who made any considerable
Defence, they were so surpris'd between the Terror of the Fire, and
the sudden Attack of our Men in the Dark, that they knew not which
Way to turn themselves; for if they fled one Way, they were met by
one Party; if back again, by another: So that they were everywhere
knocked down: Nor did any of our Men receive the least hurt; ex-
cept one who strained his Foot, and another had one of his Hands
very much burnt
I was very angry with my Nephew the Captain, and indeed with
all the Men in my Mind, but with him in particular; as well for his
acting so out of his Duty as Commander of the Ship, and having the
Charge of the Voyage upon him, as in his prompting rather than cool-
ing the Rage of his Men in so bloody and cruel an Enterprise. My
Nephew answer'd me very respectfully; but told me, that when he
saw the Body of the poor Seaman, whom they had murder'd in such a
cruel and barbarous manner, he was not Master of himself, neithei
could he govern his Passion. He owned, he should not have done
so, as he was Commander of the Ship; but as he was a Man, and
Nature moved him, he could not bear it As for the rest of the Men,
they were not subject to me at all, and they knew it well enough; so
they took no notice of my Dislike.
The next Day we set sail, so we never heard any more of it: Ou'
Men differ'd in the Account of the Number they killed: Some said
one Thing, some another; but according to the best of their Accounts
put all together, they killed or destroy'd about 150 People, Men,
Women, and Children, and left not a House standing in the Town.
As for the poor Fellow Tho. Jeffry, as he was quite dead, for his
Throat was so cut, that his Head was half off, it would do him no
Service to bring him away, so they left him where they found him, only
took him down from the Tree where he was hanged by one Hand.
However just our Men thought this Action, I was against them in
It; and I always, after that Time, told them, God would blast the
Voyage; for I looked upon all the Blood they shed that Night to be
Murder in them: For though it is true, that they had killed Tho.Jcffry,
yet it was as true that Jeffry was the Aggressor, had broken the
Truce, and had violated or debauch'd a young Woman of theirs who
came down to them innocently, and on the Faith of their public
Capitulation.
The Boatswain defended this Quarrel when we were afterwards on
board: He said, It is true that we seemed to break the Truce, but
really had not, and that the War was begun the Night before by the
Natives themselves, who had shot us, and killed one of our Men
without any just Provocation; so that as we were in a Capacity to fight
them now, we might also be in a Capacity to do ourselves Justice
upon them in an extraordinary Manner, that though the poor Man had
taken a little Liberty with a Wench, he ought not to have been
murder'd, and that in such a villanous Manner: and that they did
nothing but what was just, and what the Laws of God allow'd to
be done to Murderers.
One would think this should have been enough to have warned ua
against going on Shore among Heathens and Barbarians: But it is
impossible to make Mankind wise, but at their own Expense,
and their Experience seems to be always of most Use to them
when it is dearest bought
We are now bound to the Gulf of Persia, and from thence to
the Coast of Coromandel, only to touch at Surra/: But the chief of
the Supercargo's Design lay at the Bay of Bengal, where if he
missed of his Business outward bound, he was to go up to China, and
return to the Coast as he came Home.
The first Disaster that befel us, was in the Gulf of Persia, where
five of our Men venturing on Shore on the Arabian Side of the Gulf,
were surrounded by the Arabians, and either all killed or carry'd
away into Slavery; the rest of the Boat's Crew were not able to rescue
them, and had but just Time to get off their Boat I began to up-
braid them with the just Retribution of Heaven in this Case: But the
Boatswain very warmly told me, he thought I went farther in my
Censures than I could show any Warrant for in Scripture, and referr'd
*;o the 13 St Luke, Verse 4th, where our Saviour intimates, that those
Men, on whom the Tower of Siloam fell, were not Sinners above all
the Galileans: But that which indeed put me to Silence in the Case,
was, That not one of these five Men, who were now lost, were of the
Number of those who went on Shore to the Massacre of Madagascar;
(so I always called it, though our Men could not bear the Word Massacre
with any Patience:) And indeed, this last Circumstance, as I have
said, put me to Silence for the present
But my frequent preaching to them on this Subject had worse
Consequences than I expected; and the Boatswain, who had been
the Head of the Attempt, came up boldly to me one Time, and told
me he found that I continually brought that Affair upon the Stage,
that I made unjust Reflections upon it, and had used the Men very
ill on that Account, and himself in particular; that as I was but a
Passenger, and had no Command in the Ship, or Concern in the
Voyage, they were not oblig'd to bear it; that they did not know, but
I might have some ill Design in my Head, and perhaps to call them
to Account for it, when they came to England; and that therefore,
unless I would resolve to have done with it; and also, not to concern
myself any farther with him, or any of his Affairs, he would leave the
Ship; for he did not think it was safe to sail with me among them.
I heard him patiently enough till he had done, and then told hirr
that I did confess I had all along oppos'd the Massacre of Madagascar-,
for such I would always call it; and that I had on all Occasions
spoken my Mind freely about it, though not more upon him than any
of the rest: That as to my having no Command in the Ship, that was
true; nor did I exercise any Authority, only took my Liberty of
speaking my Mind in Things which publicly concern'd us all; and
what Concern I had in the Voyage was none of his Business; that I
was a considerable Owner of the Ship; and in that Claim I conceiv'd
I had a Right to speak even farther than I had yet done, and would
J»t be accountable to him or any one else, and begun to be a little
warm with him: He made but little Reply to me at that Time, and
I thought that Affair had been over. We were at this Time in the
Road at Bengal, and being willing to see the Place, I went on Shore
with the Supercargo in the Ship's Boat, to divert myself, and towards
Evening was preparing to go on Board, when one of the Men came
to me, and told me, he would not have me trouble myself to come
down to the Boat, for they had Orders not to carry me on Board any
more. Any one may guess what a Surprise I was in at so insolent a
Message; and I asked the Man, who bade him deliver that Errand to
me? He told me, the Coxswain. I said no more to the Fellow,
but bade him let them know he had deliver'd his Message, and that I
had given him no Answer to it
I immediately went and found out the Supercargo, and told him
the Story, adding what I presently foresaw, (viz.) That there would
certainly be a Mutiny in the Ship, and entreated him to go imme-
diately on Board the Ship in an Indian Boat, and acquaint the
Captain of it: But I might have spared this Intelligence; for before
I had spoken to him on Shore, the Matter was effected on Board.
The Boatswain, the Gunner, the Carpenter; and in a Word, all the
Inferior Officers, as soon as I was gone off in the Boat, came up to
the Quarter-Deck, and desir'd to speak with the Captain, and there
ADVENTURES OF
the Boatswain making a long Harangue, for the Fellow talked very
well, and repeating all he had said to me, told the Captain in few
Words, That as I was now gone peaceably on Shore, they were lotb
to use any Violence with me; which, if I had not gone on Shore, they
would otherwise have done, to oblige me to have gone: They there-
fore thought fit to tell him, That as they shipp'd themselves to serve
in the Ship under his Command, they would perform it well and
faithfully: But if I would not quit the Ship, or the Captain oblige me
to quit it, they would all leave the Ship, and sail no farther with him;
and at that Word, ALL, he turned his Face about towards the Main-
mast, which was it seems the Signal agreed on between them; at
which, all the Seamen being got together, they cried out, One and
ALL, One and ALL
My Nephew, the Captain, was a Man of Spirit, and of great
Presence of Mind; and though he was surprls'd, you may be sure, at
the Thing, yet he told them calmly, that he would consider of the
Thing, but that he could do nothing in it till he had spoken to me
about it He used some Arguments with them, to show them the
Unreasonableness and Injustice of the Thing: But it was all in vain,
they swore and shook Hands round before his Face, that they would
go all on Shore, unless he would engage to them, not to suffer me to
come any more on Board the Ship.
This was a hard Article upon him, who knew his Obligation to me,
and did not know how I might take it; so he began to talk cavalierly
to them, told them that I was a very considerable Owner of the Ship,
and that in Justice he could not put me out of my own House; that
this was next Door to serving me, as the famous Pirate Kid had done,
who made the Mutiny in a Ship, set the Captain on Shore in an un-
inhabited Island, and run away with the Ship; that let them go into
what Ship they would, if ever they came to England again, it would
cost them dear; that the Ship was mine, and that he could not put
me out of it; and that he would rather lose the Ship and the Voyage
too, than disoblige me so much; so they might do as they pleased:
However, he would go on Shore, and talk with me on Shore, and in-
vited the Boatswain to go with me, and perhaps they might accom
modate the Matter with me.
But they all rejected the Proposal, and said, they would have
nothing to do with me any more, neither on Board or on Shore; and
if I came on Board, they would all go on Shore. Well, said the
Captain, if you are all of this Mind, let me go on Shore and talk with
him; so away he came to me with this Account, a little after the
Message had been brought to me from the Coxswain.
I was very glad to see my Nephew, I must confess; for I was not
without Apprehensions, that they would confine him by Violence, set
Sail, and run away with the Ship, and then I had been stripped naked
in a remote Country, and nothing to help myself: In short, I had
been in a worse Case, than when I was all alone in the Island.
But they had not come that length, it seems, to my great satisfac-
tion; and when my Nephew told me what they had said to him, and
how they had sworn, and shook Hands, that they would one and all
leave the Ship, if I was suffer'd to come on Board, I told him,
he should not be concern'd at it at all, for I would stay on Shore. I
only desir'd he would take Care and send me all my necessary
Things on Shore, and leave me a sufficient Sum of Money, and I
would find my Way to England, as well as I could.
This was a heavy Piece of News to my Nephew; but there was no
Way to help it, but to comply with it: So,'in short, he went on Board
the Ship again, and satisf/d the Men, that his Uncle had yielded to
their Importunity, and had sent for his Goods from on Board the
Ship; so that Matter was over in a very few Hours, the Men return'd
to their Duty, and I began to consider what Course I should steer.
I was now alone in the remotest Part of the World, as I think I
may call it; for I was near three thousand Leagues by Sea farther off
from England, than I was at my Island; only it is true, I might travel
here by Land over the Great Mogul's Country to Sural, might gc
from thence to Bassora by Sea, up the Gulf of Persia, and from
thence might take the Way of the Caravans over the Desert of Arabia
to Aleppo and Scanderoon; from thence by Sea again to Italy, and so
over Land into France, and this put together might be, at least, a full
Diameter of the Globe; but if it were to be measur'd, I suppose it
would appear to be a great deal more.
I had another Way before me, which was to wait for some English
Ships, which were coming to Bengal from Achin on the Island of
Sumatra, and get Passage on Board them for England: But as I came
hither without any Concern with the English East-India Company, so
it would be difficult to go from hence without their Licence, unless
with great Favour of the Captains of the Ships, or of the Company's
Factors, and to both, I was an utter Stranger.
Here I had the particular Pleasure, speaking by Contraries, to see
the Ship set sail without me, a Treatment I think a Man in my Circum-
stances scarce ever met with, except from Pirates running away with
a Ship, and setting those that would not agree with their Villany, on
Shore: Indeed this was next Door to it, both Ways; however, my
Nephew left me two Servants, or rather one Companion, and one
Servant, the first was Clerk to the Purser, who he engag'd to go
with me, and the other was his own Servant; I took me also a good
Lodging in the House of an Englishwoman, where several Merchants
lodged; some French, two Italians, or rather Jews, and one English-
man: Here I was handsomely enough entertain'd; and that I might
not be said to run rashly upon anything, I stayed here above nine
Months, considering what Course to take, and how to manage myself.
I had some English Goods with me of Value, and a considerable Sum
of Money, my Nephew furnishing me with a thousand Pieces of
Eight, and a Letter of Credit for more, if I had Occasion, that I might
not be straiten'd whatever might happen.
I quickly dispos'd of my Goods, and to Advantage too; and, as I
originally intended, I bought here some very good Diamonds, which,
of all other Things, was the most proper for me in my present Cir
cumstances, because I might always carry my whole Estate about me
After a long Stay here, and many Proposals made for my Return
to England, but none falling out to my Mind, the English Merchant
who lodged with me, and with whom I had contracted an intimate
Acquaintance, came to me one Morning: Countryman, says he, I
have a Project to communicate to you, which, as it suits with my
Thoughts, may for aught I know, suit with yours also, when you
shall have thoroughly consider'd it.
Here we are posted, says he, you by Accident, and I by my own
Choice, in a Part of the World very remote from our own Country;
but it is in a Country, where, by us who understand Trade and
Business, a great deal of Money is to be got: If you will put a
thousand Pound to my thousand Pound, we will hire a Ship here, the
first we can get to our Minds; you shall be Captain, I'll be Merchant,
and we will go a trading Voyage to China; for what should we
stand still for? The whole World is in motion, rolling round and
lound; all the Creatures of God, heavenly Bodies and earthly, are
busy and diligent, Why should we be idle? There are no Drones iu
the World but Men, Why should wc be of that Number?
I liked his Proposal very well, and the more, because it seemed to
be cxpress'd with so much good Will, and in so friendly a Manner:
I will not say, but that I might by my loose and unhing'd Circum-
stances be the fitter to embrace a Proposal for Trade, or indeed for
anything else; whereas, otherwise, Trade was none of my Element:
However, I might perhaps say with some Truth, that if Trade was
not my Element, Rambling was, and no Proposal for seeing any Part
of the World which I never had seen before, could possibly come
amiss to me.
It was however, some Time before we could get a Ship to our
Minds; and when we had got a Vessel, it was not easy to get
English Sailors; that is to say, so many as were necessary to govern
the Voyage, and manage the Sailors which we should pick up there.
After some Time we got a Mate, a Boatswain, and a Gunner English;
a Dutch Carpenter, and three Portuguese Foremast Men; with these
we found we could do well enough, having Indian Seamen, such as
they are, to make up.
There are so many Travellers, who have wrote the History of their
Voyages and Travels this Way, that it would be very little Diversion
to anybody, to give a long Account of the Places we went to, and the
People who inhabit there; those Things I leave to others, and refer
the Reader to those Journals and Travels of Englishmen, of which
many I find are publish'd, and more promis'd every Day; it is enough
to me to tell you, That I made this Voyage to Achin, in the Island ol
Sumatra, and from thence to Siam, where we exchang'd some of cir
Wares for Opium, and some Arrack, the first, a Commodity which
bears a great Price among the Chinese, and which at that Time, was
very much wanted there. In a Word, we went up to Suskan, made a
very great Voyagt; was eight Months out, and return'd to Bengal,
and I was very well satisfy'd with my Adventure: I observe that oui
People in England, often admire how the Officers which the Company
send into India, and the Merchants which generally stay there, get
such very great Estates as they do, and sometimes come home worth
60, 70 to 100 thousand Pound at a Time.
But it is no Wonder, or at least we shall see so much farther into
h, when we consider the innumerable Ports and Places where they
have a free Commerce; that it will then be no Wonder; and much
less will it be so, when we consider, that at all those Places and Pot *s
where the English Ships come, there is so much, and such constant
Demand for the Growth of all other Countries, that there is a certain
Vent for the Returns, as well as a Market abroad, for the Goods
carried out
In short, we made a very good Voyage, and I got so much Money
by the first Adventure, and such an Insight into the Method of
getting more, that had I been twenty Year younger, I should have
been tempted to have stayed here and sought no farther, for making
my Fortune; but what was all this, to a Man on the wrong Side of
threescore, that was rich enough, and came abroad, more in Obedi-
ence to a restless Desire of seeing the World, than a covetous Desire
of getting in it; and indeed I think, it is with great Justice, that I now
call it a restless Desire for it was so; when I was at Home, I was
restless to go abroad; and now I was abroad, I was restless to be at
Home: I say, what was this Gain to me? I was rich enough, nor
had I any uneasie Desires about getting more Money; and therefore
the Profits of the Voyage to me were Things of no great Force, for
the prompting me forward to farther Undertakings; and I thought
that by this Voyage I had made no Progress at all, because I was
come back as I might call it, to the Place from whence I came as
to a Home; whereas, my Eye, which like that which Solomon speaks
of, was never satisfied with Seeing, was still more desirous of Wandering
and Seeing; I was come into a Part of the World, which I was never
in before; and that Part in particular, which I had heard much of;
and was resolv'd to see as much of as I could, and then I thought, I
might say, I had seen all the World, that was worth seeing.
But my Fellow Traveller and I, had different Notions; I do not
name this, to insist upon my own, for I acknowledge his were the
most just and the most suited to the end of a Merchant's Life; who,
when he is abroad upon Adventures, it is his Wisdom to stick to that
as the best Thing for him, which he is like to get the most Money by:
My new Friend kept himself to the Nature of the Thing, and would
have been content to have gone like a Carrier's Horse, always to the
same Inn, backward and forward, provided he could, as he called it,
find his Account in it; on the other Hand, mine was the Notion of a
mad rambling Boy, that never cares to see a Thing twice over.
But this was not all; I had a Kind of Impatience upon me to be
nearer Home, and yet the most unsettled Resolution imaginable
which Way to go; in the Interval of these Consultations, my Friend,
who was always upon the Search for Business, propos'd another
Voyage to me among the Spice Islands, and to bring Home a Load-
ing of Cloves from the Manillas, or thereabouts; Places where
indeed the Dutch do trade, but Islands, belonging partly to the
Spaniards; though we went not so far, but to some other, where they
have not the whole Power, as they have at Batavia, Ceylon, &"C.
We were not long in preparing for this Voyage; the chief Difficulty was
in bringing me to come into it; however, at last nothing else offering,
and finding that really stirring about and trading, the Profit being
so great, and as I may say certain, had more Pleasure in it, and more
Satisfaction to the Mind than sitting still, which to me especially,
was the unhappiest Part of Life: I resolv'd on his Voyage too,
which we made very successfully, touching at Borneo, and several
Islands, whose Names I do not remember, and came Home in about
five Months; we sold our Spice, which was chiefly Cloves, and
some Nutmegs, to the Persian Merchants, who carry'd them away
for the Gulf: and making near five of one, we really got a great
deal of Money.
My Friend, when we made up this Account smiled at me; well
now, said he, with a Sort of agreeable insulting my indolent
Temper; is not this better than walking about here, like a Man oj
nothing to do, and spending our Time in staring at the Nonsense and
Ignorance of the Pagans? Why truly, says I, my Friend, I think it is;
and I begin to be a Convert to the Principles of Merchandising;
but I must tell you, said I, by the Way, you do not know what I am
a-doing, for if once I conquer my backwardness, and embark heartily;
as old as I am, I shall harass you up and down the World, till I
tire you; for I shall pursue it so eagerly, I shall never let you lie
still.
But to be short with my Speculations, a little while after this, there
came in a Dutch Ship from Batavia; she was a Coaster, not an
European Trader, and of about two hundred Ton Burden: The Men,
as they pretended, having been so sickly, that the Captain had not
Men enough to go to Sea with; he lay by at Bengal, and having it
seems got Money enough, or being willing for other Reasons, to go
for Europe, he gave public Notice, that he would sell his Ship: This
came to my Ears before my new Partner heard of it; and I had a
great Mind to buy it, so I goes Home to him, and told him of it
He considered awhile, for he was no rash Man neither; but musing
(ome Time, he reply'd, she is a little too big; but however, we wilJ
ADVENTURES OP
have her; accordingly we bought the Ship, and agreeing with the
Master, we paid for her, and took Possession; when we had done so,
we resolv'd to entertain the men if we could, to join them with those
we had, for the pursuing our Business; but on a sudden, they having
receiv'd not their Wages, but their Share of the Money, not one of
them was to be found; we inquir'd much about them, and at length
were told, that they were all gone together by Land to Agra, the
great City of the Mogul's Residence; and from thence were to travel
*o Surat, and so by Sea, to the Gulf of Persia.
Nothing had so heartily troubled me a good while; as that I missed
the Opportunity of going with them; for such a Ramble I thought,
and in such Company, as would both have guarded me and diverted
me, would have suited mightily with my great Design; and I should
oth have seen the World, and gone homewards too; but I was much
better satisfied a few Days after, when I came to know what sort of
Fellows they were; for in short their History was, that this Man they
called Captain was the Gunner only, not the Commander; that they
had been a trading Voyage, in which, they were attack'd on Shore, by
some of the Malayans, who had killed the Captain, and three of his
Men; and that after the Captain was killed, these Men, eleven in
Number, had resolv'd to run away with the Ship, which they did;
and brought her in at the Bay of Bengal, leaving the Mate and five
Men more on Shore, of whom, we shall hear farther.
Well, let them come by the Ship how they would, we came honestly
by her, as we thought, though we did not I confess, examine into
Things so exactly as we ought, for we never inquir'd anything
of the Seamen; who, if we had examin'd, would certainly have
falter'd in their Account, contradicted one another, and perhaps
contradicted themselves, or onehow or other, we should have
seen Reason to have suspected them; but the Man showed us a
Bill of Sale for the Ship, to one Emanuel Clostershoven, or some such
Name; for I suppose it was all a Forgery, and called himself by that
Name, and we could not contradict him; and being withal a little too
unwary, or at least, having no Suspicion of the Thing, we went
through with our Bargain.
We picked up some more English Seamen here after this, and some
Dutch; and now we resolv'd for a second Voyage, to the South East
for Cloves, cVv., that is to say, among the Philippine and Malacca
Isles; and in short, not to fill this Part of my Story with Trifles,
44'
when what is yet to come, is so remarkable; I spent from first to last
six Years in this Country, trading from Port to Port, backward and
forward, and with very good Success; and was now the last Year
with my new Partner, going in the Ship above-mention'd, on a Voyage
to China; but designing first to Siam, to buy Rice.
In this Voyage, being by contrary Winds oblig'd to beat up and
down a great while in the Straits of Malacca, and among the Islands;
we were no sooner got clear of those difficult Seas, but we found our
Ship had sprung a Leak, and we were not able by all our Industry to
find it out where it was. This forced us to make for some Port, and
my Partner, who knew the Country better than I did, directed
the Captain to put into the River of Cambodia, for I had made the
English Mate, one Mr. Thomson, Captain, not being willing to take
the Charge of the Ship upon myself: This River lies on the North
Side of the great Bay or Gulf, which goes up to Siam.
While we were here, and going often on Shore for Refreshment,
there comes to me one Day
an Englishman, and he was it
seems, a Gunner's Mate, on
board an English East-India
Ship, which rode in the same
River, up at, or near the City
of Cambodia; what brought
him hither we know not; but
he comes up to me, and
speaking English: Sir, says
he, you are a Stranger to me,
and I to you; but I have some-
thing to tell you,that very nearly —-=^^-^_ * *9
concerns you.
I looked steadily at him a good while, and thought at first I had
known him, but I did not; if it very nearly concerns me, said I,
and not yourself, what moves you to tell it me? I am moved, says
he, by the imminent Danger you are in, and for aught I see, you have
no Knowledge of it; I know no Danger I am in, said I, but that my
Ship is leaky, and I cannot find it out; but I purpose to lay her
a-Ground to-Morrow, to see if I can find it; but Sir, says he, leaky,
or not leaky, find it, or not find it, you will be wiser than to lay
your Ship on Shore to-Morrow, when you hear what I have to say to

you; do you know Sir, said he, the Town of Cambottia lies about
fifteen Leagues up this River? And there are two large English
Ships about five Leagues on this side, and three Dutch; well, saidi;
and what is that to me? Why Sir, said he, is it for a Man that is
upon such Adventures as you are upon, to come into a Port, and not
examine first what Ships there are there, and whether he is able to deal
with them? I suppose you do not think you are a Match for them: I
was amus'd very much at his Discourse, but not amaz'd at it, for I
could not conceive what he meant; and I turned short upon him and
said, Sir, I wish you would explain yourself; I cannot imagine what
Reason I have to be afraid of any Company of Ships, or Dutch Ships;
I am no Interloper, what can they have to say to me?
He looked like a Man half'angry, half pleased, and pausing awhile,
but smiling ; well, Sir, says he, if you think yourself secure, you must
take your Chance; I am sorry your Fate should blind you against
good Advice; but assure yourself, if you do not put to Sea imme-
diately, you will the very next Tide be attack'd by five Long-Boats
full of Men, and perhaps if you are taken, you'll be hanged for a
Pirate, and the Particulars be examin'd afterwards: I thought, Sir,
added he, I should have met with a better Reception than this, foi
doing you a Piece of Service of such Importance: I can never be
ungrateful, said I, for any Service, or to any Man that offers me any
Kindness, but it is past my Comprehension, said I, what they
should have such a Design upon me for; however, since you
say, there is no Time to be lost, and that there is some villanous
Design in Hand against me; I'll go on board this Minute, and put
to sea immediately, if my Men can stop the Leak, or if we
can swim without stopping it But, Sir, said I, shall I go away
ignorant of the Reason of all this? Can you give me no farther
Light into it?
I can tell you but Part of the Story, Sir, says he, but I have a Dutch
Seaman here with me, and I believe I could persuade him to tell you
the rest; but there is scarce Time for it But the Short of the Story
is this, the first Part of which, I suppose, you know well enough, (viz.)
that you was with this Ship at Sumatra, that there your Captain was
murder'd by the Malayans, with three of his Men, and that you ot
some of those who were on board with you, ran away with the Ship,
and are since turned PIRA TES; this is the Sum of the Story, and you
will be all seized as Pirates I can assure you, and executed, with very
Bttlt Ceremony; for you know, Merchants' Ships show bu< little
Law to Pirates, if they get them into their Power.
Now you speak plain English, said I, and I thank you; and though
I know nothing, that we have done, like what you talk of, but am sure"
we came honestly and fairly by the Ship, yet seeing such Work is
a-doing as you say, and that you seem to mean honestly, I'll be upon
my Guard. Nay, Sir, says he, do not talk of being upon your guard;
the best Defence, is to be out of the Danger, if you have any Regard
to your Life, and the Lives of all your Men; put out to Sea without
fail at High Water, and as you have a whole Tide before you, you
will be gone too far out before they can come down, for they came
away at High Water; and as they have twenty Miles to come, you
get near two Hours of them, by the Difference of the Tide, not
reckoning the Length of the Way; besides, as they are only Boats,
and not Ships, they will not venture to follow you far out to Sea,
especially if it blows.
Well, says I, you have been very kind in this, what shall I do for
you, to make you amends? Sir, says he, you may not be so willing
to make me any amends, because you may not be convinc'd of the
Truth of it: I'll make an Offer to you; I have nineteen Months'
Pay due to me, on board the Ship ^—^— which I came out oi
England in, and the Dutchman that is with me has seven Months'
Pay due to him; if you will make good our Pay to us, we will go
along with you; if you find nothing more in it, we will desire no more;
but if we do convince you, that we have saved your Lives, and the
Ship, and the Lives of all the Men in her, we will leave the rest to
fou.
I consented to this readily, and went immediately on board, and
the two Men with me; as soon as I came to the Ship Side, my
Partner who was on Board, came out on the Quarter-Deck, and
called to me with a great deal of Joy, O hoi O ho I we have stopped
the leak I we have stopped the leak I Say you so, said I, thank God;
but weigh the Anchor then immediately; weigh! says he, what do you
mean by that? What is the Matter ? says he. Ask no Questions,
tays I, but all Hands to work, and weigh, without losing a Minute(
he was surpris'd, but however, he called the Captain, and he imme«
diately ordered the Anchor to be got up; and though the Tide was
not quite done, yet a little Land Breeze blowing, we stood out to Sea;
then I called him into the Cabin, and told him the Story at large*
and we called in the Men, and they told us the rest of it; but as it
took us up a great deal of Time, so before we had done, a Seaman
comes to the Cabin Door, and calls out to us, that the Captain bad
him tell us, we were chased; chased, says I, by who, and by what?
By five Sloops or Boats, says the Fellow, full of Men; very well, said
/, then it is apparent there is something in it; in the next Place I
order'd all our Men to be called up, and told them, that there was a
Design to Seize the Ship, and to take us for Pirates, and asked them,
if they would stand by us, and by one another; the Men answer'd
cheerfully, that one and all, they would live and die with us: Then I
asked the Captain, what Way he thought best for us to manage a
Fight with them; for resist them I was resolv'd we would, and that,
to the last Drop; he said readily, That the Way was to keep them
off with our great Shot, as long as we could, and then to fire at
them with our small Arms as long as we could; but when neither
of these would do any longer, we should retire to our close Quarters \
perhaps they had not Materials to break open our Bulk-Heads, or
get in upon us.
The Gunner had in the meantime, Order to bring two Guns to
bear fore and aft out of the Steerage, to clear the Deck, and load them
with Musket-Bullets and small Pieces of old Iron, and what next
came to Hand, and thus we made ready for Fight; but all this while
we kept out to Sea, with Wind enough; and could see the Boats at a
Distance, being five large Lorg-Boats, following us with all the sail
they could make.
Two of those Boats, which by our Glasses we could see were
English, out-sailed the rest, were near two Leagues a-Head of
them, and gained upon us considerably; so that we found they would
come up with us; upon which, we fired a Gun without Ball, to inti-
mate, that they should bring to, and we put out a Flag of Truce; as a
Signal for Parley, but they kept crowding after us, till they came
within Shot: When we took in our White Flag, they having made no
Answer to it, hung out a red Flag, and fired at them with a Shot:
Notwithstanding this, they came on, till they were near enough to call
to them with a speaking Trumpet, which we had on Board; so we
tailed to them, and bid them keep off at their Peril
.
It was all one, they crowded after us, and endeavoured to come
under our Stern, so to board us on our Quarter; upon which, seeing
they were resolute for Mischief, and depended upon the Strength that
followed them, I ordered to bring the Ship to, so that they lay upon
our Broadside, when immediately we fired five Guns at them; one of
which had been levelled so true, as to carry away the Stern of the
hindermost Boat, and bring them to the Necessity of taking down
their Sail, and running all to the Head of the Boat to keep her from
sinking; so she lay by, and had enough of it; but seeing the foremost
Boat crowd on after us, we made ready to fire at her in particular.
While this was doing, one of the three Boats that was behind,
being forwarder than the other two, made up to the Boat which we
had disabled, to relieve her, and we could afterwards see her take out
the Men; we called again to the foremost Boat, and offer'd a Truce
to parley again, and to know what was her Business with us; but had
no Answer, only she crowded close under our Ster n; upon this our
Gunner, who was a very dexterous Fellow, run out his two Chase-Guns
and fired again at her; but the shot missing, the Men in the Boat
shouted, waved their Caps, and came on; but the Gunner getting
quickly ready again, fired among them the second Time; one Shot 0/
which, though it missed the Boat itself, yet fell in among the Men, and
we could easily see, had done a great deal of Mischief among them;
but we taking no Notice of that, wared the Ship again, and brought
our Quarter to bear upon them; and firing three Guns more, we found
the Boat was split almost to Pieces; in particular, her Rudder, and
a Piece of her Stern was shot quite away, so they handed their Sail
immediately, and were in great Disorder; but to complete their mis-
fortune, our Gunner let fly two Guns at them again; where he hit
them we could not tell, but we found the Boat was sinking, and some
of the Men already in the Water; upon this, I immediately Manned
out our Pinnace, which we had kept close by our Side, with Orders
to pick up some of the Men if they could, and save them from drown-
ing, and immediately to come on board with them; because we saw
the rest of the Boats began to come up; our Men in the Pinnace
followed their Orders, and took up three Men; one of which was
just drowning, and it was a good while before we could recover him;
as soon as they were on Board, we crowded all the Sail we could
make, and stood farther out to Sea, and we found that when the other
three Boats came up to the first two, they gave over their Chase.
Being thus deliver'd from a Danger, which though I knew not the
Reason of it, yet seemed to be much greater than I apprehended; 1
took Care that we would change our Course, and not let anv one
imagine whither we were going; so we stood out to Sea Eastward,
quite out of the Course of all European Ships, whether they were
bound to China, or anywhere else, within the Commerce of the
European Nations
When we were now at Sea, we began to consult with the two Sea-
men, and inquire first what the Meaning of all this should be, and
the Dutchman let us into the Secret of it at once; telling us that the
Fellow that sold us the Ship, as we said, was no more than a Thief,
that had run away with her: Then he told us, how the Captain,
whose Name too he told us, though I do not remember, was treache-
rously murdered by the Natives on the Coast of Malacca, with three
of his Men; and that he, this Dutchman, and four more, got into
the Woods, where they wandered about a great while; till at length,
he in particular, in a miraculous Manner made his Escape, and swam
off to a Dutch Ship, which sailing near the Shore, in its way from
China, had sent their Boat on Shore for fresh Water; that he durst
not come to that Part of the Shore where the Boat was, but
shift in the Night, to take the Water farther off, and the Ship's Boat
took him up.
He then told us, that he went to Batavia, where two of the Sea-
men belonging to the Ship arriv'd, having deserted the rest in theii
Travels, and gave an Account, that the Fellow who had run away
with the Ship, sold her at Bengal, to a Set of Pirates, which were gone
a Cruising in her; and that they had already taken an English Ship,
and two Dutch Ships very richly laden.
This latter Part we found to concern us directly, and though we
knew it to be false; yet as my Partner said very well, if we had fallen
into their Hands, and they had had such a Prepossession against us
beforehand, it had been in vain for us to have defended ourselves,
or to hope for any good Quarter at their Hands, and especially con-
sidering that our Accusers had been our Judges, and that we could
have expected nothing from them, but what Rage would have dic-
tated, and an ungovern'd Passion have executed; and therefore it
was his Opinion, we should go directly back to Bengal, from whence
we came, without putting in at any Port whatever; because there
we could give a good Account of ourselves, could prove where
we were when the Ship put in, who we bought her of, and the
like; and which was more than all the rest, if we were put to
the Necessity of bringing it before the proper Judges, we should
be sure to have some Justice, and not be hanged first, and Judged
afterwards.
I was sometime of my Partner's Opinion; but after a little more
serious thinking, I told him, I thought it was a very great Hazard for
us to attempt returning to Bengal, for that we were on the wrong Side
of the Straits of Malacca; and that if the Alarm was given, we should
be sure to be Waylaid on every Side, as well by the Dutch of Batavia,
as the English elsewhere; that if we should be taken, as it were,
running away, we should even condemn ourselves, and there would
want no more Evidence to destroy us; I also asked the English
Sailor's Opinion, who said, he was of my Mind, and that we should
certainly he taken.
This Danger a little startled my Partner and all the Ship's Com-
pany; and we immediately resolv'd to go away to the Coast of Ton-
quin, and so on to the Coast of China, and pursuing the first Design
as to Trade, find some Way or other to dispose of the Ship, and come
back in some of the Vessels of the Country, such as we could get:
This was approv'd of as th» best Method for our Security; and ac-
cordingly we steered away N.N.E., keeping above fifty Leagues off
from the usual Course to the Eastward.
This however put us to some Inconveniences; for first the Winds,
when we came to the Distance from the Shore, seemed to be more
steadily against us, blowing almost Trade, as we call it, from the East,
and E.N.E. so that we were a long while upon our Voyage, and we were
but ill provided with Victuals for so long a Voyage; and which was still
worse, there was some Danger that those English and Dutch Ships, whose
Boats pursu'd us, whereof some were bound that Way, might be got in
before us, and if not, some other Ship, bound to China, might have
Information of us from them, and pursue us with the same Vigour.
I must confess I was now very uneasy, and thought myself, in-
cluding the late Escape from the Long-Boats, to have been in the
most dangerous Condition that ever I was in through all my past Life;
or whatever ill Circumstances I had been in, I was never pursu'd for
a Thief before; nor had I ever done anything that merited the
Name of Dishonest or Fraudulent, much less Thievish. I had chiefly
been my own Enemy, or as I may rightly say, I had been nobody's
Enemy but my own: But now I was embarrass'd in the worst Con
dition imaginable; for though I was perfectly innocent, I was in no
Condition to make that Innocence appear: And if I had been taken,
it had been under a suppos'd Guilt of the worst Kind; at least, 8
Crime esteem'd so among the People I had to do with.
This made me very anxious to make an Escape, though, which
Way to do it, I knew not, or what Port or Place we should go to: My
Partner seeing me thus dejected, though he was the most concern'd
at first, began to encourage me; and describing to me the several
Ports of that Coast, told me he would put in on the Coast of Cochin-
china, or the Bay of Tonquin, intending to go afterwards to Macao, a
Town once in the Possession of the Portuguese, and where still a great
many European Families resided, and particularly the Missionary
Priests usually went thither, in order to their going forward to China.
Hither then we resolv'd to go; and accordingly, though after a
tedious and irregular Course, and very much straitened for Provisions,
we came within Sight of the Coast very early in the Morning; and
upon Reflection upon the past Circumstances we were in, and the
Danger if we had not escap'd, we resolv'd to put into a small River,
which however had a Depth enough of Water for us, and to see if we
could, either over Land, or by the Ship's Pinnace, come to know
what Ships were in any Port thereabouts. This happy Step was
indeed our Deliverance; for though we did not immediately see any
European Ships in the Bay of Tonquin, yet the next Morning there
came into the Bay two Dutch Ships, and a third without any Colours
spread out, but which we believ'd to be a Dutchman passed by at
about two Leagues' Distance, steering for the Coast of China; and
in the Afternoon went by two English Ships steering the same Course;
and thus, we thought, we saw ourselves beset with Enemies, both one
Way or other. The Place we were in was wild and barbarous, the
People Thieves, even by Occupation or Profession; and though it is
true we had not much to seek of them, and except getting a few Pro-
visions, cared not how little we had to do with them, yet it was with
much Difficulty that we kept ourselves from being insulted by them
several Ways.
We were in a small River of this Country, within a few Leagues of
its utmost Limits Northward; and by our Boat we coasted North-East
to the Point of Land, which opens the great Bay of Tonquin; and it
was in this beating up along the Shore, that we discover'd, as above,
that in a Word, we were surrounded with Enemies. The People we
were among, were the most barbarous of all the Inhabitants of the
Coast; having no Correspondence with any other Nation, and dealing
only in Fish, and Oil, and such Gross Commodities; and it may be
particularly seen, that they are, as I said, the most barbarous of any
of the Inhabitants, (viz.) that among other Customs they have this as
one, (viz.) That if any Vessel have the Misfortune to be shipwreck'd
upon their Coast, they presently make their Men all Prisoners or
Slaves; and it was not long before we found a spice of their Kindness
this Way, on the Occasion following.
I have obseiVd above, that our Ship sprung a Leak at Sea, and
that we could not find it out; and however, it happen'd, that as I
have said, it was stopped unexpectedly in the happy Minute of our
being to be seized by the Dutch and English Ships in the Bay of
Siam; yet as we did not find the Ship so perfectly fit and sound as
we desir'd, we resolv'd, while we were in this Place, to lay her on
Shore, take out what heavy Things we had on Board, which were not
many, and to wash and clean her Bottom, and, if possible, to find
out where the Leaks were.
Accordingly, having lighten'd the Ship, and brought all our Gunj
and other moveable Things to one Side, we tried to bring her down,
that we might come at her Bottom; but on second Thoughts we did
net care to lay her dry on Ground, neither could we find out a proper
Place for it
The Inhabitants, who had never been acquainted with such a
Sight, came wondering down to the Shore, to look at us; and seeing
the Ship lie down on one side in such a manner, and heeling in
towards the Shore, and not seeing our Men, who were at Work on her
Bottom, with Stages and with their Boats on the off-side, they pre*
sently concluded that the Ship was cast away, and lay so fast on the
Ground.
On this Supposition they came all about us in two or three Hours'
time, with ten or twelve large Boats, having some of them eight,
some ten Men in a Boat, intending, no doubt, to have come on Board,
and plunder'd the Ship; and if they had found us there, to have
carry'd us away for Slaves to their King, or whatever they call him;
for we knew nothing who was their Governor.
When they came up to the Ship, and began to row round her, they
discover'd us all hard at Work on the Outside of the Ship's bottom
and side, washing, and graving, and stopping, as every Seafaring Man
knows how.
They stood for a while gazing at us, and we, who were a little sur-
pris'd, codid not imagine what their Design was; but, being willing to
be sure, we took this Opportunity to get some of us into the Ship, and
others to hand down Arms and Ammunition to those that were at
Work, to defend themselves with, if there should be Occasion; and it
was no more that Need; for in less than a quarter of an Hour's Con-
sultation, they agreed, it seems, that the Ship was really a Wreck, that
we were all at Work endeavouring to save her, or to save our Lives
by the Help of our Boats; and when we handed our Arms into the
Boats, they concluded, by that motion, that we were endeavouring to
save some of our Goods; upon this they took it for granted we all
belong'd to them; and away they came down upon our Men, as if it
had been in a Line of Battle.
Our Men, seeing so many of them, began to be frighted; for we
lay but in an ill Posture to fight, and cried out to us to know what
they should do: I immediately called to the Men who worked upon
the Stages, to slip them down, and get up the side into the Ship; and
bade those in the Boat to row round and come on board; and those
few of us, who were on board, worked with all the strength and
hands we had, to bring the Ship to Rights; but however, neither
the Men upon the Stages or those in the Boats, could do as they were
order'd, before the Cochinchineses were upon them; and two of their
Boats boarded our Long-Boat, and began to lay hold of the Men as
their Prisoners.
The first Man they laid hold of was an English Seaman, a stout
strong Fellow, who having a Musket in his Hand, never offer'd to fire
it, but laid it down in the Boat, like a Fool, as I thought: but he
understood his Business better than I could teach him; for he grappled
the Pagan, and dragged him by main Force out of their own Boat into
ours; where, taking him by the two Ears, he beat his Head so against
the Boat's Gunnel, that the Fellow died instantly in his Hands; and
in the meantime, a Dutchman, who stood next, took up the Musket,
and with the Butt-end of it, so laid about him, that he knock'd down
five of them, who attempted to enter the Boat But this was doing
little towards resisting thirty or forty Men, who fearless, because
ignorant of their Danger, began to throw themselves into the Long-
Boat, where we had but five Men in all to defend it: But one
Accident gave our Men a complete Victory, which deserv'd our
Laughter rather than anything else, and that was this:
Our Carpenter being preparing to yave the Outside of the Ship,
as well as to pay the Seams, where he had caulked her to stop the
Leaks, had got two Kettles just let down into the Boat; one filled
with boiling Pitch, and the other with Rosin, Tallow, and Oil, and
such Stuff as the Shipwrights use for that Work; and the MaD
that tended the Carpenter had a great Iron Ladle in his Hand,
with which he supply'd the Men that were at Work with that hot
Stuff; two of the Enemy's Men entered the Boat just where this
Fellow stood, being in the Fore-sheets; he immediately saluted them
with a Ladle full of the Stuff, boiling hot, which so burnt and scalded
them, being half naked, that they roared out like two Bulls, and,
enrag'd with the Fire, leaped both into the Sea: The Carpenter saw
it, and cried out, Well done, Jack, give them some more of it; and
stepping forward himself, takes one of their Mops, and dipping it in
the Pitch-Pot, he and his Man threw it among them so plentifully
that, in short, of all the Men in three Boats, there was not one
that was not scalded and burnt with it in a most frightful pitiful
Manner, and made such a Howling and Crying, that I never heard a
worse Noise, and indeed nothing like it; for it is worth observing,
That though Pain naturally makes all People cry out, yet every
Nation has a particular Way of Exclamation, and make Noises as
different from one another as their Speech; I cannot give the Noise
these Creatures made a better Name than Howling, nor a Name
more proper to the Tone of it; for I never heard anything more
like the Noise of the Wolves, which as I have said, I heard howl in
the Forest on the Frontiers of Languedoc.
I was never pleased with a Victory better in my Life; not only as
it was a perfect Surprise to me, and that our Danger was imminent
before: But as we got this Victory without any Bloodshed, except of
that Man the Fellow killed with his naked Hands, and which I was
very much concern'd at; for I was sick of killing such poor savage
Wretches, even though it was in my own Defence, knowing they came
on Errands which they thought just, and knew no better; end that
though it may be a just Thing, because necessary, for there is no
necessary Wickedness in Nature, yet I thought it was a sad Life,
which we must be always oblig'd to be killing our Fellow-Creatures
to preserve our own, and indeed I think so still; and I would
even now suffer a great deal, rather than I would take away the
Life, even of that Person injuring me: And I believe, all con-
sidering People, who know the Value of Life, vould be of my
Opinion, at least, they would, if they entered seriously into the Con-
sideration of it
But to return to my Story. All the while this was doing, my Partnei
ind I, who manag'd the rest of the Men on Board, had with great
Dexterity brought the Ship almost to Rights; and having gotten the
Guns into their Places again, the Gunner called to me to bid our
Boat get out of the Way, for he would let fly among them. I called
back again to him, and bid him not offer to fire, for the Carpenter
would do the Work without him, but bade him heat another Pitch-
Kettle, which our Cook, who was on Board, took Care of: But the
Enemy were so terrify'd with what they had met with in their first
Attack, that they would not come on again; and some of them
that were farthest off, seeing the Ship swim, as it were upright, begun,
as we supposed, to see their Mistake, and give over the Enterprise,
finding it was not as they expected. Thus we got clear of this merry
Fight; and having gotten some Rice, and some Roots, and Bread,
with about sixteen good big Hogs on Board, two Days before, we re-
solv'd to stay here no longer, but go forward whatever came of it; for
we made no Doubt but we should be surrounded the next Day with
Rogues enough, perhaps more than our Pitch-Kettle would dispose of
for us.
We therefore got all our Things on Board the same Evening, and
the next Morning were ready to sail; in the meantime, lying at an
Anchor at some Distance, we were not so much concern'd, being now
in a fighting Posture, as well as in a sailing Posture, if any Enemy had
presented: The next Day having finish'd our Work within Board,
and finding our Ship was perfectly healed of all her Leaks, we set
Sail. We would have gone into the Bay of Tonquin; for we wanted
to inform ourselves of what was to be known concerning the Dutch
Ships that had been there; but we durst not stand in there, because
we had seen several Ships go in, as we suppos'd, but a little before;
so we kept on N.E. towards the Isle of Formosa, as much afraid of
being seen by a Dutch or English Merchant Ship, as a Dutch or
English Merchant Ship in the Mediterranean is of an Algerine Man of
War.
When we were thus got to Sea, we kept out N.E. as if we would
go to the Manillas or the Philippine Islands; and this we did, that
we might not fall into the Way of any of our European Ships; and
then we steered North till we came to the Latitude of »a Degrees,
30 Min.; by which means we made the Island Formosa directly,
where we came to an Anchor, in order to get Water and fresh Pro-
visions, which the People there, who are very courteous and civil in
their Manners, supplied us with willingly, and dealt very fairly and
punctually with us in all their Agreements and Bargains; which is
what we did not find among other People; and may be owing to the
Remains of Christianity, which was once planted here by a Dutch
Missionary of Protestants, and is a Testimony of what I have often
observ'd, viz. That the Christian Religion always civilizes the People,
and reforms their Manners, where it is receiv'd, whether it works
saving Effects upon them or no.
From hence we sailed still North, keeping the Coast of China at
an equal Distance, till we knew we were beyond all the Ports of
China, where our European Ships usually come; being resolv'd, if
possible, not to fall into any of their Hands, especially in this
Country, where, as our Circumstances were, we could not fail of being
entirely ruined; nay, so great was my Fear in particular, as to my
being taken by them, that I believe firmly, I would much rather have
chosen to fall into the Hands of the Spanish Inquisition.
Being now come to the Latitude of 30 Degrees, we resolv'd to put
into the first trading Port we should come at; and standing in for the
Shore, a Boat came off two Leagues to us, with an old Portuguese
Pilot on Board, who knowing us to be an European Ship, came to
offer his Service, which indeed we were very glad of, and took him
on Board; upon which, without asking us whither we would go, he
dismiss'd the Boat he came in, and sent them back.
I thought it was now so much in our Choice, to make the old Man
carry us whither we would; that I began to talk with him about car-
rying us to the Gulf of Nankin, which is the most Northern Part
of the Coast of China: The old Man said he knew the Gulf of
Nankin very well; but smiling, asked us what we would do there?
I told him, we would sell our Cargo, and purchase China-Waxes,
Calicoes, Raw-Silks, Tea, Wrought-Silks, Grc, and so would return
by the same Course we came: He told us our best Port had been to
have put in at Macao, where we could not have failed of a Market for
our Opium, to our Satisfaction, and might for our Money have pur-
chas'd all Sorts of China-Goods, as cheap as we could at Nankin.
Not being able to put the old Man out of his Talk, of which he
was very opiniated or conceited, I told him, we were Gentlemen, as
well as Merchants, and that we had a Mind to go and see the great
City of Pekin, and the famous Court of the Monarch of China.
Why then, says the old Man, you should go to Ningpo, where, by the
River which runs into the Sea there, you may go up within five
Leagues of the Great Canal. This Canal is a navigable River, which
goes through the Heart of that vast Empire of China, crosses all
the Rivers, passes some considerable Hills by the Help of Sluices and
Gates, and goes up to the City of Pekin, being in Length near
370 Leagues.
Well, said I, Seignior Portuguese, but that is not our Business now:
The great Question is, If you can carry us up to the City of Nankin,
from whence we can travel to Pekin afterwards? Yes, he said, he
could do so very well, and that there was a great Dutch Ship gone up
that Way just before. This gave me a little Shock; and a Dutch Ship
was now our Terror, and we had much rather have met the Devil, at
least, if he had not come in too frightful a Figure; and we depended
upon it, that a Dutch Ship would be our Destruction, for we were in
no Condition to fight them; all the Ships they trade with into those
Parts being of great Burden, and of much greater Force than we were.
The old Man found me a little confus'd, and under some Concern,
when he named a Dutch Ship, and said to me, Sir, you need be under
no Apprehensions of the Dutch, I suppose they are not now at War
with your Nation: No, says I, that's true; but I know not what
Liberties Men may take when they are out of the Reach of the Law:
Why, says he, you are no Pirates, what need you fear? They will not
meddle with peaceable Merchants sure.
If I had any Blood in my Body that did not fly up into my Face
at that Word, it was hinder'd by some Stop in the Vessels, appointed
by Nature to prevent it; for it put me into the greatest Disorder and
Confusion imaginable: Nor was it possible for me to conceal it so,
but that the old Man easily perceiv'd it
Sir, says he, I find you are in some Disorder in your Thoughts at
my Talk, pray be pleased to go which Way you think fit, and depend
upon it, I'll do you all the Service I can. Why, Seignior, said I, it if
true I am a little unsettled in my Resolution at this Time whither to
go in particular; and I am something more so, for what you said
about Pirates, I hope there are no Pirates in these Seas; we are but
in an ill Condition to meet with them, for you see we have but a
small Force, and but very weakly Manned.
0 Sii, says he, do not be concera'd, I do not know that there has
been any Pirates in these Seas these fifteen Years, except one which
was seen, as I hear, in the Bay of Siam, about a Month since; but
you may be assur'd she is gone to the Southward; nor was she a Ship
of any great Force, or fit for the Work; she was not built for a Priva-
teer, but was run away with by a reprobate Crew that were on Board,
after the Captain and some of his Men had been murder'd by the
Malayans, at or near the Island of Sumatra.
What! said I, seeming to know nothing of the Matter, did they
murder the Captain? No, said he, I do not understand that they
murder'd him; but as they afterwards run away with the Ship, it is
generally believ'd they betray'd him into the Hands of the Malayans,
who did murder him, and perhaps they procur'd them to do it
Why then, said I, they deserve Death as much as if they had done it
themselves. Nay, says the old Man, they do deserve it, and they will
certainly have it, if they light upon any English or Dutch Ship; for
they have all agreed together, that if they meet that Rogue, they will
give him no Quarter.
But, said I to him, you say the Pirate is gone out of those Seas.
How can they meet with him? Why, that is true, says he, they do say
so; but he was, as I tell you, in the Bay of Siam, in the River Cam-
bodia, and was discover'd there by some Dutchmen who belong'd to
the Ship, and who were left on Shore when they run away with her;
And some English and Dutch Traders being in the River, they were
within a little of taking him: Nay, said he, if the foremost Boats had
been well seconded by the rest, they had certainly taken him; but
he finding only two Boats within reach of him, tacked about, and fired
at these two, and disabled them before the other came up, and then
standing off to Sea, the other were not able to follow him, and so he
fcot away: But they have all so exact a Description of the Ship, that
they will be sure to know him; and wherever they find him, they have
vowed to give no Quarter, to either the Captain, or the Seamen, but
to hang them all up at the Yard-Arm.
What! says I, will they execute them right or wrong; hang them
first, and judge them afterwards? O Sir! says the old Pilot, there's
00 Need to make a formal Business of it with such Rogues as those,
let them tie them Back to Back, and set them a diving; it is no
more than they richly deserve.
1 knew I had my old Man fast aboard, and that he could do me

no Hanr 30 that I turned short upon him: Well now, Seignior, said
I, and this is the very Reason why I would have you carry us up to
Nankin, and not to put back to Macao, or to any other part of the
Country, where the English or
Dutch Ships come; for be it
known to you, Seignior, those
Captains of the English and
Dutch Ships are a Parcel of
rash, proud, insolent Fellows,
that neither know what belongs
to Justice, nor how to behave
themselves, as the Laws of God
and Nature direct; but being
proud of their Offices, and not
understanding their Power, they
would act the Murderers to
punish Robbers; would take
upon them to insult Men falsely
accus'd, and determine them guilty without due Inquiry; and perhaps
I may live to call some of them to an Account for it, where they may
be taught how Justice is to be executed, and that no Man ought to
be treated as a Criminal, till some Evidence may be had of the
Crime, and that he is the Man.
With this I told him, that this was the very Ship they attack'd,
and gave him a full Account of the Skirmish we had with their Boats,
and how foolishly and coward-like they behav'd. I told him all the
Story of our buying the Ship, and how the Dutchmen served us. I
told him the Reasons I had to believe that this Story of killing the
Master by the Malayans was true; as also the running away with
the Ship; but that it was all a Fiction of their own, to suggest that
the Men were turned Pirates; and they ought to have been sure it was
so, before they had ventur'd to attack us by Surprise, and oblige us
to resist them; adding that they would have the Blood of those Men,
who we killed there in our just Defence, to arrwer for.
The old Man was amaz'd at this Relation, and told us, we were
very much in the Right to go away to the North, and that if he might
advise us, it should be to sell the Ship in China, which we might
very well do, and buy or build another in the Country; and, said he,
though you will not get so good a Ship, yet you may get one able
enough to carry you and all your Goods back again to Bengal, or any-
where else.
I told him, I would take his Advice, when I came to any Port
where I could find a Ship for my Turn, or get any Customer
to buy this: He reply'd, I should meet with Customers enough for
the Ship at Nankin, and that a Chinese Junk would serve me very
well to go back again; and that he would procure me People, both to
buy one and sell the other.
Well, but Seignior, says I, as you say they know the Ship so well,
I may perhaps, if I follow your Measures, be instrumental to bring
some honest innocent Men into a terrible Broil, and perhaps to be
murder'd in cold Blood; for wherever they find the Ship, they will
prove the Guilt upon the Men, by proving this was the Ship, and so
innocent Men may probably be overpower'd and murder'd: Why,
says the old Man, I will find out a Way to prevent that also; for as I
know all those Commanders you speak of very well, and shall so:
them all as they pass by, I will be sure to set them to Rights in the
Thing, and let them know that they had been so much in the Wrong;
that though the People, who were on board at first, might run away
with the Ship, yet it was not true that they had turned Pirates; and that
in particular, these were not the Men that first went off with the SI- p,
but innocently bought her for their Trade; and I am persuaded they
will so far believe me, as at least to act more cautiously for the Time to
come. Well, says I, And will you deliver one Message to them from
me? Yes, I will, says he, if you will give it under your Hand in Writing,
that I may be able to prove that it came from you, and not out of
my own Head. I answer'd, That I would readily give it him under
tny Hand; so I took a Pen, and Ink, and Paper, and wrote at large
the Story of assaulting me with the Long-Boats, Gre., the pretended
Reason of it, and the unjust cruel Design of it; and concluded to the
Commanders, that they had done what they not only should have
been asham'd of, but also, that if ever they came to England, and
I lived to see them there, they should all pay dearly for it, if the
Laws of my Country were not grown out of Use before I arriv'd
there.
My old Pilot read this over and over again, and asked me several
Times if I would stand to it? I answer'd, I would stand to it as long
as I had anything left in the World, being sensible that I should
one Time or other find an Opportunity to put it home to them: But
we had no Occasion ever to let the Pilot carry this Letter; for he
never went back again: While those things were passing between us,
by Way of Discourse, we went forward, directly for Nankin, and in
about thirteen Days' Sail came to an Anchor at the South-West Point
of the great Gulf of Nankin, where, by the Way, I came by Acci-
dent to understand, that two Dutch Ships were gone the Length before
me, and that I should certainly fall into their Hands; I consulted
my Partner again in this Exigency, and he was as much at a Loss as
I was, and would very gladly have been safe on Shore almost any-
where; however, I was not in such Perplexity neither, but I
asked the old Pilot, if there was no Creek or Harbour, which I might
put into, and pursue my Business with the Chinese privately, and be
in no Danger of the Enemy: he told me, if I would sail to the
Southward about two and forty Leagues, there was a little Port called
Quinchang, where the Fathers of the Mission usually landed from
Macao, on their Progress to teach the Christian Religion to the
Chinese, and where no European Ships ever put in; and if I thought
to put in there, I might consider what farther Course to take when I
was on Shore: He confess'd, he said, it was not a Place for Merchants,
except that at some certain Times, they had a Kind of a Fair there,
when the Merchants from Japan came over thither to buy the Chinese
Merchandizes.
We all agreed to go back to this Place; the name of the Port, as he
called it, I may perhaps spell wrong; for I do not particularly remember
it, having lost this, together with the Names of many other Places,
set down in a little Pocket-Book, which was spoiled by the Water,
on an Accident, which I shall relate in its Order; but this I re-
member, that the Chinese, or Japanese Merchants we corresponded
with, called it by a differing Name from that which our Portuguese
Pilot gave it, and pronounc'd it as above, Quinchang.
As we were unanimous in our Resolutions to go to this Place, we
weighed the next Day, having only gone twice on Shore, where we were
to get fresh Water; on both which Occasions, the People of the
Country were very civil to us, and brought us Abundance of Things
to sell to us; I mean, of Provisions, Plants, Roots, Tea, Rice, and
some Fowls; but nothing without Money.
We came to the other Port, (the Wind being contrary) not till five
Days, but it was very much to our Satisfaction; and I was joyful, and I
may say, thankful, when I set my Foot safe on Shore; resolving, and
my Partner too, that if it was possible to dispose of ourselves and
Effects, any other Way, though not every Way to our Satisfaction, we
would never set one Foot on Board that unhappy Vessel more; and
indeed I must acknowledge, that of all the Circumstances of Life,
that ever I had any Experience of, nothing makes Mankind so com-
pletely miserable, as that of being in constant Fear: Well does the
Scripture say, the Fear of Man brings a Snare; it is a Life of Death,
and the Mind is so entirely suppress'd by it, that it is capable of no
Relief; the animal Spirits sink, and all the Vigour of Nature, which
usually supports Men under other Afflictions, and is present to them
in the greatest Exigencies, fails them here.
Nor did it fail of its usual Operations upon the Fancy, by heightening
every Danger, representing the English and Dutch Captains to be
Men incapable of hearing Reason, or of distinguishing between
honest Men and Rogues; or between a Story calculated for our own
Turn, made out of nothing, on purpose to deceive; and a true genuine
Account of our whole Voyage, Progress, and Design; for we might
many Ways have convinc'd any reasonable Creature, that we were
not Pirates; the Goods we had on board, the Course we steered, or
frankly showing ourselves, and entering into such and such Ports;
and even our very Manner, the Force we had, the Number of Men,
the few Arms, little Ammunition, short Provisions; all these would
have served to convince any Men, that we were no Pirates; the
Opium, and other Goods we had on board, would make it appear,
the Ship had been at Bengal; the Dutchmen, who it was said, had
the Names of all the Men that were in the Ship, might easily see
that we were a Mixture of English, Portuguese, and Indians, and but
two Dutchmen on board: These, and many other particular Circum-
stances, might have made it evident to the Understanding of any
Commander, whose Hands we might fall into, that we were no
Pirates.
But Fear, that blind useless Passion, worked another Way, and
threw us into the Vapours; it bewilder'd our Understandings, and
set the Imagination at Work, to form a thousand terrible Things, that
perhaps might never happen; we first suppos'd, as indeed everybody
fiad related to us, that the Seamen on board the English and Dutch
Ships, but especially the Dutch, were so enrag'd at the Name of a
Pirate, and especially at our beating of their Boats, and escaping, that
diey would not give themselves Leave to inquire, whether we were
Pirates or no; but would execute us off Hand, as we call it, withmt
giving us any Room for a Defence; we reflected that there was
really so much apparent Evidence before them, that they wou'd
scarce inquire after any more; as first, That the Ship was certainly
the same, and that some of the Seamen among them knew her, and
had been on board her; and secondly, That when we had Intelli-
gence at the River of Cambodia, that they were coming down to
examine us, we fought their Boat and fled; so that we made no
doubt but they were fully satisfy'd of our being Pirates, as we were
satisfy'd of the contrary; and as I often said, I know not but I should
have been apt to have taken those Circumstances for Evidence, if the
Tables were turned, and my Case was theirs, and have made no
Scruple of cutting all the Crew to Pieces, without believing, or perhaps
considering, what they might have to offer in their Defence.
But let that be how it will, those were our Apprehensions; and
both my Partner and I too, scarce slept a Night, without dreaming of
Halters, and Yard-Arms; that is to say, Gibbets, of fighting, and
being taken; of killing and being killed; and one Night I was in
such a Fury in my Dream, fancying the Dutchmen had boarded us,
and I was knocking one of their Seamen down, that I struck my
double Fist against the Side of the Cabin I lay in, with such a Force,
as wounded my Hand most grievously, broke my Knuckles, and cut
and bruised the Flesh; so that it not only waked me out of my Sleep,
but I was once afraid I should have lost two of my Fingers.
Another Apprehension I had, was of the cruel Usage we might
meet with from them, if we fell into their Hands; then the Story of
Amboyna came into my Head, and how the Dutch might perhaps
torture us, as they did our Countrymen there; and make some of our
Men, by Extremity of Torture, confess those Crimes they never were
guilty of; own themselves, and all of us to be Pirates, and so they
would put us to Death, with a formal Appearance of Justice; and
that they might be tempted to do this, for the Gain of our Ship and
Cargo, which was worth four or five thousand Pound, put all together.
These Things tormented me and my Partner too, Night and Day;
nor did we consider that the Captains of Ships have no Authority to
act thus; and if we had surrender^ Prisoners to them, they could not
answer the destroying us, or torturing us, but would be accountable
for it, when they came into their own Country: This I say, gave me
no Satisfaction; for if they will act thus with us, what Advantage
A VISION OF THE ISLAND
would it be to us, that they would be called to an Account for it; or
if we were first to be murder'd, what Satisfaction would it be to ui
to have them punish'd when they came Home?
I cannot refrain taking Notice here, what Reflections I now had
upon the past Variety of my particular Circumstances; how hard I
thought it was, that I who had spent forty Years in a Life of continu'd
Difficulties, and was at last come as it were to the Port or Haven,
which all Men drive at, (viz.) to have Rest and Plenty, should be a
Volunteer in new Sorrows, by my own unhappy Choice; and that I,
who had escap'd so many Dangers in my Youth, should now come to
be hanged in my old Age, and in so remote a Place, for a Crime I was
not in the least inclin'd to, much less really guilty of; and in a Place
and Circumstance where Innocence was not like to be any Protection
at all to me.
After these Thoughts, something of Religion would come in; and
I should be considering, that this seemed to me to be a Disposition of
immediate Providence, and I ought to look upon it, and submit to it
as such; that although I was innocent as to Men, I was far from being
innocent as to my Maker; and I ought to look in and examine, what
other Crimes in my Life, were most obvious to me; and for which,
Providence might justly inflict this Punishment, as a Retribution; and
that I ought to submit to this, just as I would to a Shipwreck, if it
had pleased God to have brought such a Disaster upon me.
In its Turn, Natural Courage would sometimes take its Place; and
then I would be talking myself up to vigorous Resolutions, that I
would not be taken, to be barbarously used by a Parcel of merciless
Wretches, in cold Blood; that it were much better to have fallen into
the Hands of the Savages, who were Man-Eaters, and who, I was
sure, would feast upon me, when they had taken me; than by those,
who would perhaps glut their Rage upon me, by inhuman Tortures
and Barbarities ; that in the Case of the Savages, I always resolv'd to
die fighting, to the last Gasp ; and why should I not do so, seeing it
was much more dreadful to me at least, to think of falling into these
Men's Hands, than ever it was to think of being eaten by Men; for
the Savages, give them their Due, would not eat a Man till he was
dead, and killed them first, as we do a Bullock; but that these Men
had many Arts beyond the Cruelty of Death: Whenever these
Thoughts prevail'd, I was sure to put myself in a kind of Fever, with
the Agitations of a suppos'd Fight: my Blood would boil, and my
(. L
Eyes sparkle, as if I was engag'd; and I always resolv'd that I would
take no Quarter at their Hands; but even at last, if I could resist no
longer, I would blow up the Ship and all that was in her, and leave
them but little Booty to boast of.
By how much the greater Weight, the Anxieties and Perplexities of
these Things were to our Thoughts while we were at Sea, by so much
the greater was our Satisfaction, when we saw ourselves on Shore;
and my Partner told me he dreamed, that he had a very heavy Load
upon his Back, which he was to cany up a Hill, and found that he was
not able to stand long under it; but that the Portuguese Pilot came
and took it off his Back, and the Hill disappear'd, the Ground before
him showing all smooth and plain, and truly it was so, we were all
like Men, who had a Load taken off their Backs.
For my Part, I had a Weight taken uff from my Heart, that I was
not able any longer to bear; and as I said above, we resolv'd to go
no more to Sea in that Ship: When we came on Shore, the old
Pilot, who was now our Friend, got us a Lodging and a Warehouse
for our Goods, which by the Way, was much the same: it was a little
House or Hut, with a large House joining to it, all built with Canes,
and palisadoed round with large Canes, to keep out pilfering Thieves,
of which, it seems, there were not a few in that Country; however,
the Magistrates allow'd us also a little Guard, and we had a Sentinel
with the kind of Halberd, or Half-pike, who stood Sentinel at our Door;
to whom we allow'd a Pint of Rice, and a little Piece of Money, about
the Value of three Pence per Day, so that our Goods were kept very
safe.
The Fair or Mart, usually kept in this Place, had been over some
Time; however, we found that there were three or four Junks in the
River, and two Japanners, I mean, Ships from Japan, with Goods
which they had bought in China, and were not gone away, having
Japanese Merchants on Shore.
The first Thing our old Portuguese Pilot did for us, was to bring us
acquainted with three missionary Romish Priests, who were in the
Town, and who had been there some Time, converting the People to
Christianity; but we thought they made but poor Work of it, and
made them but sorry Christians when they had done; however, that
was none of our Business: One of these was a Frenchman, whom
they called Father Simon; he was a jolly well-condition'd Man, very
free in his Conversation, not seeming so serious and grave, as the
other two did; one of whom was a Portuguese, and the other a
Genoese; but Father Swum was courteous, easy in his Manner, and
very agreeable Company; the other two were more reserv'd, seemed
rigid and austere, and apply'd seriously to the Work they came about,
(viz.) to talk with, and insinuate themselves among the Inhabitants,
wherever they had Opportunity; we often eat and drank with those
Men, and though I must confess, the Conversion as they call it, of the
Chinese to Christianity, is so far from the true Conversion requir'd, to
bring Heathen People to the Faith of Christ, that it seems to amount
to little more, than letting them know the Name of Christ, and say
some Prayers to the Virgin Mary, and her Son, in a Tongue which
they understand not, and to cross themselves and the like; yet it must
be confess'd that these Religious, who we call Missionaries, have a
firm Belief that these People shall be saved, and that they are the In-
struments of it; and on this Account, they undergo not only the
Fatigue of the Voyage, and Hazards of living in such Places, but
oftentimes Death itself, with the most violent Tortures, for the Sake
of this Work; and it would be a great Want of Charity in us, what-
ever Opinion we have of the Work itself, and the Manner of their
doing it, if we should not have a good Opinion of their Zeal, who
undertook it with so many Hazards, and who have no Prospect of the
least Temporal Advantage to themselves.
But to return to my Story; this French Priest, Father Simon, was
appointed it seems, by Order of the Chief of the Mission, to go up to
Pekin, the Royal Seat of the Chinese Emperor, and waited only for
another Priest, who was order'd to come to him from Macao, to go
along with him; and we scarce ever met together, but he was inviting
me to go that Journey, telling me, how he would show me all the
glorious Things of that mighty Empire; and among the rest, the
greatest City in the World; a City, said he, that your London and our
Paris put together, cannot be equal to. This was the City of Pekin. x
which I confess is very great, and infinitely full of People; but as I
looked on those Things with different Eyes from other Men, so I
shall give my Opinion of them in few Words, when I come in the
Course of my Travels, to speak more particularly of them.
But first, I come to my Friar or Missionary; dining with him one
Day, and being very merry together, I showed some little Inclination
to go with him, and he pressed me and try Partner very hard, and with
a great many Persuasions to consent; whv. Father Simon, says mj
Partner, why should you desire our Company so much? You know
we are Heretics, and you do not love us, nor cannot keep us Com-
pany with any Pleasure. O! says he, You may perhaps be good
Catholics in Time; my business here is to convert Heathens, and
who knows but I may convert you too. Very well, Father, said I, so
you will preach to us all the Way; I won't be troublesome to you,
says he; our Religion does not divest us of good Manners; besides,
says he, we are here like Countrymen, and so we are compared to
the Place we are in; and if you are Hugonots, and I a Catholic, we
may be all Christians at last; at least, said he, we are all Gentlemen,
and we may converse so, without being uneasy to one another. I
liked that Part of his Discourse very well, and it began to put me in
Mind of my Priest, that I had left in the Brasils; but this Father
Simon did not come up to his Character, by a great deal; for though
Father Simon had no Appearance of a criminal Levity in him neither,
yet he had not that Fund of Christian Zeal, strict Piety, and sincere
Affection to Religion, that my other good Ecclesiastic had, of whom
I have said so much.
But to leave him a little, though he never left us, nor soliciting us
to go with him; but we had something else before us at first; for wj
had all this while our Ship, and our Merchandize to dispose of, and
we began to be very doubtful what we should do, for we were now in
a Place of very little Business; and once I was about to venture to
sail for the River of Kilam, and the City of Nankin: But Providence
seemed now more visibly as I thought, than ever, to concern itself in
our Affair; and I was encourag'd from this very Time, to think, 1
should one Way or other get out of this tangled Circumstance, and
be brought Home to my own Country again, though I had not the
least View of the Manner; and when I began sometimes to think of
it, could not imagine by what method it was to be done: Providence,
/ say, began here to clear up our Way a little; and the first Thing
that offer'd was, that our old Portuguese Pilot brought a Japan
Merchant to us, who began to inquire what Goods we had; and in
the first Place, he bought all our Opium, and gave us a very good
Price for it, paying us in Gold by Weight, some in small Pieces of
their own Coin, and some in small Wedges, of about ten or eleven
Ounces each. While we were dealing with him for our Opium, it
came into my Head, that he might perhaps deal with us for the Ship
too, and I order'd the Interpreter to propose it to him; he shrunk up
his Shoulders at it when it was first propos'd to him; but hi a few
Days after, he came to me with one of the Missionary Priests for hit
Interpreter, and told me he had a Proposal to make to me, and that
was this; he had bought a great Quantity of Goods of us, when he
had no Thoughts (or Proposals made to him) of buying the Ship; and
that therefore, he had not Money enough to pay for the Ship; but if
I would let the same Men who were in the Ship navigate her, hs
would hire the Ship to go to Japan, and would send them from thence
to the Philippine Islands with another Loading, which he would pay
the Freight of, before they went from Japan; and that at their Return,
he would buy the Ship: I began to listen to his Proposal, and so
eager did my Head still run upon Rambling, that I could not but
begin to entertain a Notion of going myself with him, and so to sail from
the Philippine Islands, away to the South-Seas; and accordingly I
asked the Japanese Merchant, if he would not hire us to the Philippine
Islands, and discharge us there; he said, No he could not do that,
for then he could not have the Return of his Cargo; but he would
discharge us in Japan, he said, at the Ship's Return. Well, still I was
for taking him at that Proposal, and going myself; but my Partner,
wiser than myself, persuaded me from it, representing the Dangers as
well of the Seas, as of the Japaneses, who are a false, cruel, and
treacherous People; and then of the Spaniards, at the Philippines,
more false, more cruel, and more treacherous than they.
But to bring this long Turn of our Affairs to a Conclusion; the
first Thing we had to do, was to consult with the Captain of the Ship,
and with his Men, and know if they were willing to go to Japan; and
while I was doing this, the young Man, who, as I said, my Nephew
had left with me as my Companion for my Travels, came to me, and
told me, that he thought that Voyage promised very fair, and that
there was a great Prospect of Advantage, and he would be very glad
if I undertook it; but that if I would not, and would give him leave,
he would go as a Merchant, or how I pleased to order him; that if
ever he came to England, and I was there and alive, he would render
me a faithful Account of his Success, and it should be as much mine
as I pleased.
I was really loth to part with him, but considering the Prospect of
Advantage, which was really considerable, and that he was a young
Fellow as likely to do well in it as any I knew, I inclin'd to let him
go; but first I told him, I would consult my Partner, and give hiir
an Answer the next Day; my Partner and I discours'd about it, and
my Partner made a most generous Offer; he told me, you know it
has been an unlucky Ship, and we both resolve not to go to Sea in it
again; if your Steward, so he called my Man, will venture the Voyage,
I'll leave my Share of the Vessel to him, and let him make his best of
it; and if we live to meet in England, and he meets with Success
abroad, he shall Account for one Half of the Profits of the Ship's
Freight to us, the other shall be his own.
If my Partner, who was no Way concern'd with my young Man,
made him such an Offer, I could do no less than offer him the same;
and all the Ship's Company being willing to go with him, we made
over Half the Ship to him in Property, and took a Writing from him,
obliging him to account for the other, and away he went to Japan.
The Japan Merchant proved a very punctual honest Man to him, pro-
tected him at Japan, and got him a Licence to come on Shore, which
the Europeans in general have not lately obtain'd; paid him his
Freight very punctually, sent him to the Philippines, loaded with Japan,
and China Wares, and a Supercargo of their own, who trafficking with
the Spaniards, brought back European Goods again, and a great
Quantity of Cloves, and other Spice; and there he was not oDly paid
his Freight very well, and at a very good Price, but being not willing
to sell the Ship then, the Merchant furnish'd him with Goods on his
own Account; that for some Money, and some Spices of his own,
which he brought with him, he went back to the Manillas to the
Spaniards, where he sold his Cargo very well: Here having gotten
a good Acquaintance at Manilla, he got his Ship made a free Ship;
and the Governor of Manilla hired him, to go to Acapulco, in America,
on the Coast of Mexico, and gave him a Licence to Land there, and
travel to Mexico, and to pass in any Spanish Ship to Europe, with all
his Men.
He made the Voyage to Acapulco very happily, and there he sold
his Ship; and having there also obtained Allowance to travel by
Land, to Porto Bcllo, he found Means somehow or other, to get to
Jamaica, with all his Treasure; and about eight Years after, came to
England exceeding Rich; of the which, I shall take Notice in its
Place; in the mean time, I return to our particular Affairs.
Being now to part with the Ship, and Ship's Company, it came be-
fore us of Course to consider what Recompense we should give to
the two Men that gave us such timely Notice of the Design
against us in the River of Cambodia. The Truth was, that they had
done us a considerable Service, and deserv'd well at our Hands j
though by the Way, they were a Couple of Rogues too; for as they
believ'd the Story of our being Pirates, and that we had really run
away with the Ship, they came down to us, not only to betray the
Design that was formed against us, but to go to Sea with us as
Pirates; and one of them confess'd afterwards, that nothing else
but the Hopes of going a Roguing brought him to do it; however,
the Service they did us was not the less; and therefore, as I had pro-
mis'd to be grateful to them, I first order'd the Money to be paid
to them, which they said was due to them on board their respective
Ships; that is to say, the Englishman nineteen Months' Pay, and to
the Dutchman seven; and over and above that, I gave them, each
of them, a small Sum of Money in Gold, and which contented them
very well; then I made the Englishman Gunner in the Ship, the
Gunner being now made second Mate, and Purser; the Dutchman
I made Boatswain; so they were both very well pleased, and proved
very serviceable, being both able Seamen, and very stout Fellows.
We were now on Shore in China; if I thought myself banish'd,
and remote from my own Country at Bengal, where I had many
Ways to get home for my Money; what could I think of myself
now? When I was gotten about a thousand Leagues farther off
from Home, and perfectly destitute of all Manner of Prospect of
Return.
All we had for it was this, that in about four Months' Time,
there was to be another Fair at the Place where we were; and
then we might be able to purchase all sorts of the Manufactures of
the Country, and withal, might possibly find some Chinese Junks 01
Vessels from Tonquin, that would be to be sold, and would carry us
and our Goods whither we pleased; this I liked very well, and re-
solv'd to wait; besides, as our particular Persons were not obnoxious,
so if any English or Dutch Ships came thither, perhaps we might have
an Opportunity to load our Goods, and get Passage to some other
Place in India, nearer Home.
Upon these Hopes we resoh/d to continue here; but to divert
ourselves, we took two or three Journeys into the Country; first we
rent ten Days'Journey to seethe Cityof Nankin, and a City well worth
seeing indeed; they say it has a Million of People in it; which, how
ever, I do not believe; it is regularly built, the Streets all exactlj
straight, and cross one another in direct Lines, which gives the
Figure of it great Advantage.
But when I come to compare the miserable Feople of these
Countries with ours, their Fabrics, their manner of Living, their
Government, their Religion, their Wealth, and their Glory, (as some
call it,) I must confess I do not so much as think it is worth naming,
or worth my while to write of, or any that shall come after me to
read.
It is very observable that we wonder at the Grandeur, the Riches,
the Pomp, the Ceremonies, the Government, the Manufactures, the
Commerce, and the Conduct of these People; not that it is to be
wonder^ at, or indeed in the least to be regarded; but because,
having first a true Notion of the Barbarity of those Countries, the
Rudeness and the Ignorance that prevails there, we do not expect to
find any such things so far off.
Otherwise, what are their Buildings to the Palaces and Royal
Buildings of Europe? What their Trade, to the universal Com-
merce of England, Holland, France and Spain? What are their Cities
to ours, for Wealth, Strength, Gaiety of Apparel, rich Furniture, and
an infinite Variety? What are their Ports, supply'd with a few Junks
and Barks, to our Navigation, our Merchant Fleets, our large and
powerful Navies? Our City of London has more Trade than all their
mighty Empire: one English, or Dutch, or French Man-of-War of
80 Guns, would fight and destroy all the Shipping of China: But the
Greatness of their Wealth, their Trade, the Power of their Govern-
ment, and Strength of their Armies, is surprising to us, because, as I
have said, considering them as a barbarous Nation of Pagans, litde
better than Savages, we did not expect such Things among them;
and this indeed is the Advantage with which all their Greatness and
Power is represented to us; otherwise it is in itself nothing at all;
for as I have said of their Ships, so may be said of their Armies and
Troops; all the Forces of their Empire, though they were to bring
two Millions of Men into the Field together, would be able to do
nothing but ruin the Country, and starve themselves: If they were
to besiege a strong Town in Flanders, or to fight a disciplin'd Army,
one Line of German Cuirassiers, or of French Cavalry, would over-
throw all the Horse of China; a Million of their Foot could nol
stand before one embattled Body of our Infantry, posted so as not
to be surrounded, though they were to be not One to Twenty in
Number; nay, I do not boast if I say that 30,000 German or English
Foot, and 10,000 French Horse, would fairly beat all the Forces of
China: And so of our fortified Towns, and of the Art of our Engi-
neers in assaulting and defending Towns; there is not a fortified
Town in China could hold out one Month against the Batteries and
Attacks of an European Army; and at the same time, all the
Armies of China could never take such a Town as Dunkirk, provided
it was not starved; no, not in a ten Years' Siege. They have Fire-
Arms, it is true, but they are awkward, clumsy, and uncertain in going
off: They have Powder, but it is of no Strength: They have neither
Discipline in the Field, Exercise to their Arms, Skill to Attack, or
Temper to Retreat; and therefore, I must confess, it seemed strange
to me, when I came Home, and heard our People say such
fine Things of the Power, Riches, Glory, Magnificence, and Trade of
the Chinese; because I saw, and knew, that they were a contemptible
Herd or Crowd of ignorant sordid Slaves, subjected to a Government
qualified only to rule such a People; and in a word, for I am now
launched quite beside my Design, I say, in a word, were not its
Distance inconceivably great from Muscovy, and was not the Muscovite
Empire almost as rude, impotent, and ill govern'd a Crowd of Slaves
as they, the Czar of Muscovy might with much Ease drive them all
out of their Country, and conquer them in one Campaign; and had
the Czar, who I since hear is a growing Prince, and begins to appear
foimidable in the World, fallen this Way, instead of attacking the
warlike Swedes, in which Attempt none of the Powers of Europe
would have envy'd or interrupted him; he might by this time have
been Emperor of China, instead of being beaten by the King of
Sweden at Narva, when the latter was not One to Six in Number. As
their Strength and their Grandeur, so their Navigation, Commerce,
and Husbandry, is imperfect and impotent, compar'd to the same
Things in Europe; also in their Knowledge, their Learning, their
Skill in the Sciences; they have Globes and Spheres, and a Smatch
of the Knowledge of the Mathematics; but when you come to inquire
into their Knowledge, how short-sighted are the wisest of their
Students! they know nothing of the Motion of the Heavenly Bodies;
and so grossly absurdly ignorant, that when the Sun is eclips'd, they
think it is a great Dragon has assaulted and run away with it, and
they fall a clattering with all the Drums and Kettles in the Country,
to fright the Monster away, just as we do to hive a Swarm of Bees.
As this is the only Excursion of this kind which I have made in
all the Account I have given of my Travels, so I shall make no more
Descriptions of Countries and People, it is none of my Business, or
any part of my Design; but giving an Account of my own Adven-
tures, through a Life of inimitable Wanderings, and a long Variety of
Changes, which perhaps few that come after me will have heard the
like of; I shall therefore say very little of all the mighty Places, desert
Countries, and numerous People, I have yet to pass through more
than relates to my own Story, and which my Concern among them
will make necessary. I was now, as near as I can compute, in the
heart of China, about the Latitude of thirty Degrees North of the
Line, for we were return'd from Nankin; I had indeed a mind to
see the City of Pekin, which I had heard so much of, and Father
Simon importun'd me daily to do it; at length his Time of going
away being set, and the other Missionary, who was to go with him,
being arriv'd from Macao, it was necessary that we should resolve,
either to go, or not to go; so I referr'd him to my Partner, and left it
wholly to his Choice, who at length resolv'd it in the Affirmative, and
we prepar'd for our Journey. We set out with very good Ad-
vantage, as to finding the Way, for we got leave to travel in the
Retinue of one of their Mandarins, a kind of Viceroy, or principal
Magistrate in the Province where they reside, and who take great
State upon them, travelling with great Attendance, and with great
Homage from the People, who are sometimes greatly impoverish'd
by them, because all the Countries they pass through are oblig'd to
furnish Provisions for them and all their Attendance: That which
I particularly observed, as to our travelling with his Baggage, was this,
That though we received sufficient Provisions, both for ourselves and
our Horses, from the Country, as belonging to the Mandarin, yet
we were obliged to pay for everything we had, after the Market Price
of the Country, and the Mandarin's Steward, or Commissary of the
Provisions, collected it duly from us; so that our travelling in the
Retinue of the Mandarin, though it was a very great Kindness to us,
was not such a mighty Favour in him, but was indeed a great
Advantage to him, considering there were above thirty other People
travelled in the same Manner besides us, under the Protection of his
Retinue, or as we may call it, under his Convoy: This, I say, was a
great Advantage to him, for the Country furnish'd all the Provisioni
for nothing, and he took all our Money for them.
We were five and twenty Days travelling to Pekin, through a
Country infinitely populous, but miserably cultivated ; the Husbandry,
the Economy, and the Way of living miserable, though they boast
so much of the Industry of the People; I say miserable, and so it
is, if we who understand how to live were to endure it, or to com-
pare it with our own, but not so to these poor Wretches who know
no other: The Pride of these People is infinitely great, and exceeded
by nothing but their Poverty, which adds to that which I call their
Misery; and I must needs think the naked Savages of America live
much more happy, because, as they have nothing, so they desire
nothing; whereas these are proud and insolent, and in the main are
mere Beggars and Drudges; Their Ostentation is inexpressible, and
is chiefly showed in their Clothes and Building, and in the keeping
Multitudes of Servants or Slaves, and, which is to the last Degree
ridiculous, their Contempt of all the World but themselves.
I must confess, I travell'd more pleasantly afterwards in the Deserts
and vast Wildernesses of Grand Tartary, than here; and yet the
Roads here are well paved, and well kept, and very convenient for
Travellers: but nothing was more awkward to me, than to see such
a haughty, imperious, insolent People, in the midst of the grossest
Simplicity and Ignorance, for all their famed Ingenuity is no more:
And my Friend Father Simon and I used to be very merry upon
these Occasions, to see the beggarly Pride of those People; for
Example: Coming by the House of a Country Gentleman, as Father
Simon called him, about ten Leagues off of the City of Nankin, we
had first of all the Honour to ride with the Master of the House
about two Miles: The State he rode in was a perfect Don Quixotism,
being a Mixture of Pomp and Poverty.
The Habit of this greasy Don was very proper for a Scaramouch or
Merry-Andrew, being a dirty Calico, with all the Tawdry and Trap-
ping of a Fool's Coat, such as Hanging-sleeves, Tassels, and Cuts and
Slashes almost on every Side; it covered a Taffety Vest, as greasy
as a Butcher, and which testify'd that his Honour must needs be a
most exquisite Sloven.
His Horse was a poor, lean, starved, hobbling Creature, such as in
England might sell for about 30 or 40 Shillings, and he had two
Slaves folloVd him on Foot, to drive the poor Creature along; he
had a Whip in his Hand, and he belabour'd the Beast as fast about
the Head, as his Slaves did about the Tail, and thus he rode by us
with about ten or twelve Servants, and we were told he was goinj,
from the City to his Country Seat, about half a League before us:
We travell'd on gently, but this Figure of a Gentleman rode away
before us, and as we stopped at a Village about an Hour to refresh us,
when we came by the Country Seat of this great Man, we saw him
in a little Place, before his Door, eating his Repast; it was a Kind
of a Garden, but he was easy to be seen, and we were given to
understand that the more we looked on him, the better he would be
pleased.
He sat under a Tree, something like the Palmetto Tree, which
effectually shaded him over the Head, and on the South Side, but
under the Tree also, was placed a large Umbrella, which made that
Part look well enough; he sat lolling back in a great Elbow Chair,
being a heavy corpulent Man, and his Meat being brought him by
two Women Slaves; he had two more, whose Office, I think, few
Gentlemen in Europe would accept of their Service in, (viz.) One fed
the Squire with a Spoon, and the othev held the Dish with one Hand,
and scraped off what he let fall upon his Worship's Beard and Taffety
Vest, while the great fat Brute thought it below him to employ his
own Hands in any of those familiar Offices, which Kings and Monarchs
would rather do, than be troubled with the clumsy Fingers of their
Servants.
I took this Time to think what Pain Men's Pride puts them to;
and how troublesome a haughty Temper, thus ill-manag'd, must be to a
Man of common Sense; and leaving the poor Wretch to please him-
self with our looking at him, as if we admir'd his Pomp, whereas we
really pitied and contemn'd him, we pursu'd our Journey; onlj
Father Simon had the Curiosity to stay to inform himself what
Dainties the Country Justice had to feed on, in all his State, which
he said he had the Honour to taste of, and which was, I think, a
Dose that an English Hound would scarce have eaten, if it had been
offer'd him, (vis.) a Mess of boiled Rice with a great Piece of Garlic
in it, and a little Bag filled with Green Pepper, and another Plant
which they have here, something like our Ginger, but smelling like
Musk, and tasfing like Mustard; all this was put together, and a small
Lump or Piece of lean Mutton boiled in it; and this was his Wor-
ship's Repast, four or five Servants more attending at a Distance. If
he fed them meaner than he was fed himself, the Spice excepted,
they must fare very coarsely indeed.
As for our Mandarin, with whom we travell'd, he was respected
like a King; surrounded always with his Gentlemen, and attended in
all his Appearances with such Pomp, that I saw little of him but at a
Distance, but this I observ'd, that there was not a Horse in his
Retinue, but that our Carriers' Pack-Horses in England seem to me to
look much better, but they were so cover'd with Equipage, Mantles,
Trappings and such like Trumpery, that you cannot see whether
they are fat or lean; in a Word, we could see scarce anything but
their Feet and their Heads.
I was now light-hearted, and all my Trouble and Perplexity that I
have given an Account of being over, I had no anxious Thoughts
about me, which made this Journey the pleasanter to me, nor had I
any ill Accident attended me, only in the passing or fording a small
River, my Horse fell, and made me free of the Country, as they call
it, that is to say, threw me in; the Place was not deep, but it wetted
me all over; I mention it because it spoiled my Pocket-Book, wherein
I had set down the Names of several People and Places which I had
Occasion to remember, and which, not taking due Care of, the Leaves
rotted, and the Words were never after to be read, to my great Loss,
as to the Names of some Places I touched at in this Voyage.
At length we arriv'd at Pekin; I had nobody with me but the
Youth, whom my Nephew, the Captain, had given me to attend me as
a Servant, and who proved very trusty and diligent; and my Partner
had nobody with him but one Servant, who was a Kinsman: as for
the Portuguese Pilot, he being desirous to see the Court, we gave him
his Passage, that is to say, bore his Charges for his Company; and to
use him as an Interpreter, for he understood the Language of the
Country, and spoke good French, and a little English; and indeed,
this old Man was a most useful Implement to us everywhere; for we
liad not been above a week at Pekin, when he came laughing, Ah,
Seignior Inglese, says he, / have something to tell you -will make your
Heart glad. My Heart glad, says I, What can that be? Idon't know
anything in this Country can either give me Joy or Grief to any great
degree. Yes, yes, said the old Man in broken English, make you glad,
me sorrow; sorry he would have said. This made me more inquisi-
tive. Why, said I, will it make you sorry? Because, said he, you
have brought me here 25 Days' Journey, and will leave me logo back
alone, and which way shall I get to my Port afterwards, without a
Ship, without a Horse, without Pecune? So he called Money,
being his broken Latin, of which he had abundance to make us
merry with.
In short, he told us there was a great Caravan of Muscovite and
Polish Merchants in the City, and they were preparing to set out on
their Journey by Land to Muscovy within four or five Weeks, and he
was sure we would take the Opportunity to go with them, and leave
him behind to go back all alone. I confess, I was surpris'd with his
News, a secret Joy spread itself over my own Soul, which I cannot
describe, and never felt before or since, and I had no power for a
good while to speak a Word to the old Man; but at last I turned to
him; How do you know this, said I, aic you sure it is true? Yes,
says he, I met this Morning in the Street an old Acquaintance of
mine, an Armenian, or one you call a Grecian, who is among them;
he came last from Astracan, and was designing to go to Tonquin,
where I formerly knew him, but has alter'd his mind, and is now re-
solv'd to go with the Caravan to Moscow, and so down the River
Volga to Astracan. Well, Seignior, says I, do not be uneasy about
being left to go back alone, if this be a Method for my return to
England, it shall be your Fault if you go back to Macao at all. We
then went to consulting together what was to be done, and I asked my
Partner what he thought of the Pilot's News, and whether it would
suit with his Affairs? He told me he would do just as I would, for
he had settled all his Affairs so well at Bengal, and left his Effects in
such good Hands, that as we had made a good Voyage here, if he
could vest it in China Silks, wrought and raw, such as might be worth
the Carriage, he would be content to go England, and then make his
Voyage back to Bengal, by the Company's Ships.
Having resolv'd upon this, we agreed, that if our Portugal Pilot
would go with us, we would bear his Charges to Moscow or to England
if he pleas'd; nor indeed were we to be esteem'd over generous in that
Part neither, if we had not rewarded him farther, for the Service he
had done us was really worth all that, and more; for he had not only
been a Pilot to us at Sea, but he had been like a Broker for us on
Shore; and his procuring for us the Japan Merchant, was some
hundred of Pounds in our Pocket: So we consulted together about it,
and being willing to gratify him, which was indeed but doing him
Justice, and very willing also to have him with us besides, for he
was a most necessary Man on all Occasions, we agreed to give him a
Quantity of coined Gold, which, as I compute it, came to about 175
Pounds Sterling between us, and to bear all his Charges, both for
himself and Horse, except only a Horee to carry his Goods.
Having settled this among ourselves, we called him to let him know
what we had resolv'd; I told him, he had complain'd of our being to
let him go back alone, and I was now to tell him we were resolv'd he
should not go back at all: that as we had resolv'd to go to Europe
with the Caravan, we resolv'd also he should go with us, and that we
called him, to know his mind. He shook his Head, and said, it was
a long Journey, and he had no Pecune to carry him thither, or to
subsist himself when he came there. We told him we believ'd it
was so, and therefore we had resolv'd to do something for him, that
should let him see how sensible we were of the Service he had done
us, and also how agreeable he was to us; and then I told him what
we had resolv'd to give him here, which we might lay out as we
would do our own; and that as for his Charges, if he would go with
us, we would set him safe ashore, (Life and Casualties excepted,)
either in Muscovy or England, which he would, at our own Charge,
except only the Carriage of his Goods.
He receiv'd the Proposal like a Man transported, and told us he
would go with us over the whole World; and so, in short, we all
prepar'd ourselves for the Journey: However, as it was with us, so
it was with the other Merchants, they had many things to do, and
instead of being ready in five Weeks, it was four Months and some
odd Days before all Things were got together.
It was the Beginning of February, our Style, when we set out from
Pekin; my Partner and the old Pilot had gone express back to the
Port where he had first put in, to dispose of some Goods which we
had left there; and I with a Chinese Merchant, whom I had some
Knowledge of at Nankin, and who came to Pekin on his own
Affairs, went to Nankin, where I bought ninety Pieces of fine
Damasks, with about two hundred Pieces of other very fine Silks, of
several Sorts, some mixed with Gold, and had all these brought to
Pekin against my Partner's Return; besides this, we bought a very
large Quantity of Raw Silk, and some other Goods, our Cargo
amounting in these Goods only to about three thousand five hundred
Pounds Sterling, whi:h, together with Tea and some fine Calicoes,
and three Camels' Ixiads of Nutmegs and Cloves, loaded in all
eighteen Camels for our Share, besides those we rode upon; which
with two or three spare Horses, and two Horses loaded with
Provisions, made us in short 26 Camels and Horses in out
Retinue.
The Company was very Great, and, as near as I can remember,
made between three and four hundred Horse, and upwards of a
hundred and twenty Men, very well armed and provided for all
Events: for as the Eastern Caravans are subject to be attack'd
by the Arabs, so are these by the Tartars; but they are not altogether
so dangerous as the Arabs, nor so barbarous when they prevail.
The Company consisted of People of several Nations, such as
Muscovites chiefly, for there were above Sixty of them who were
Merchants or Inhabitants of Moscow, though of them, some were
Livonians, and to our particular Satisfaction, Five of them were Scots,
who appear'd also to be Men of great Experience in Business, and
Men of very good Substance.
When we had travell'd one Day's Journey, the Guides, who were
Five in Number, called all the Gentlemen and Merchants, that is to
say, all the Passengers except the Servants, to a great Council, as
they called it: At this great Council every one deposited a certain
Quantity of Money to a common Stock, for the necessary Expense of
buying Foiage on the Way, where it was not otherwise to be had, and
for satisfying the Guides, getting Horses, and the like: And here
they constituted the Journey, as they call it, viz. They named Captains
and Officers, to draw us all up, and give the Command in case of an
Attack, and gave every one their turn of Command: nor was this
forming us into Order any more than what we found needful upon the
Way, as shall be observ'd in its Place.
The Road all on this Side of the Country is very populous, and is
full of Potters and Earth-makers, that is to say, People that temper'd
the Earth for the China Ware; and as I was coming along, our
Portugal Pilot, who had always something or other to say to make us
merry, came sneering to me, and told me he would show me the
greatest Rarity in all the Country, and that I should have this to say
of China, after all the ill-humour'd things I had said of it, that I had
seen one thing which was not to be seen in all the World beside. I
was very importunate to know what it was: At last he told me it was
a Gentleman's house built all with China Ware. Well, says I, are not
the Materials of their Building the Product of their own Country;
and so it is all China Ware, is not it? No, no, says he, I mean it is
a House all made of China Ware, such as you call it in England;
Oi as it is called in our Country, Porcelain. Well, says I, such a
thing may be; how big is it? Can we carry it in a Box upon a
Camel? If we can, we will buy it Upon a Camel I says the old
Pilot, holding up both his Hands, why there is a Family of Thirty
People lives in it.
I was then curious indeed to see it, and when I came to it, it was
nothing but this; it was a Timber-House, or a House built, as we
call it in England, with Lath and Plaster, but all the Plastering was
really China Ware, that is to say, it was plaster'd with the Earth that
makes China Ware.
The Outside, which the Sun shone hot upon, was glazed, and looked
very well, perfect white, and painted with blue Figures, as the large
China Ware in England is painted, and hard, as if it had been burnt:
As to the Inside, all the Walls, instead of Wainscot, were lined up
with harden'd and painted Tiles, like the little square Tiles we call
Galley-Tiles in England, all made of the finest China, and the Figures
exceeding fine indeed, with extraordinary Variety of Colours mixed
with Gold, many Tiles making but one Figure, but joined so artifi-
cially, the Mortar being made of the same Earth, that it was very hard
to see where the Tiles met: The Floors of the Rooms were of the
same Composition, and as hard as the earthen Floors we have in use
in several Parts of England, especially Lincolnshire, Nottinghamshire,
Leicestershire, &c., as hard as a Stone, and smooth, but not burnt and
painted, except some smaller Rooms, like Closets, which were all as
it were paved with the same Tile; the Ceilings, and in a word, all
the plastering Work in the whole House were of the same Earth;
and after all, the Roof was cover'd with Tiles of the same, but of a
deep shining black.
This was a China Warehouse indeed, truly and literally to De
called so; and had I not been upon the Journey, I could have
stayed some Days to see and examine the Particulars of it; they
told me there were Fountains and Fish-ponds in the Garden, all
paved at the Bottom and Sides with the same, and fine Statues set
up in Rows on the Walks, entirely formed of the Porcelain Earth,
and burnt whole.
As this is one of the Singularities of China, so they may be allow'd
to excel in it; but I am very sure they excel in their Accounts of it J
lot they told me such incredible things of their Performance in
Crockery Ware, for such it is, that I care not to relate, as knowing it
M M
could not be true; they told me in particular of one Workman
that made a Ship with all its Tackle, and Masts, and Sails, in
Earthenware, big enough to carry fifty Men: If he had told me he
launched it, and made a Voyage to Japan in it, I might have said
something to it indeed; but as it was, I knew the whole of the
Story, which was in short, asking Pardon for the Word, that the
Fellow lied; so I smiled, and said nothing to it
This odd Sight kept me two Hours behind the Caravan, for which
the Leader of it for the Day fined me about the Value of three
Shillings, and told me, if it had been three Days' Journey without the
Wall, as it was three Days within, he must have fined me four times
as much, and made me ask Pardon the next Council Day; so I
promis'd to be more orderly; for indeed I found afterward the Orders
made for keeping all together, were absolutely necessary for our
common Safety.
In two Days more we passed the great China Wall, made for a
Fortification against the Tartars; and a very great Work it is, going
over Hills and Mountains in a needless Track, where the Rocks are
impassable, and the Precipices such as no Enemy could possibly
enter, or indeed climb up, or where if they did, no Wall could hinder
them: they tell us, its Length is near a thousand English Miles,
but that the Country is five hundred in a straight measur'd Line,
which the Wall bounds, without measuring the Windings and Turn-
ings it takes. It is abc at four Fathom high, and as many thick in
some Places.
I stood still an Hour or thereabout, without trespassing our
Orders, for so long the Caravan was in passing the Gate; I say, I stood
still an Hour to look at it on every Side, near, and far off; I mean,
that was within my View; and the Guide of our Caravan, who had
been extolling it for the Wonder of the World, was mighty eager to
hear my Opinion of it; I told him it was a most excellent thing to
keep off the Tartars; which he happen'd not to understand as I
meant it, and so took it for a Compliment; but the old Pilot laughed:
O, Seignior Inglese, says he, you speak in Colours : In Colours, said I,
what do you mean by that? Why, you speak what looks white this
way, and black that way; gay one way, and dull another way;
you tell him it is a good Wall to keep out Tartars? You tell me by
that, it is good for nothing but to keep out Tartars, or it will keep
out none but Tartars; I understand you Seignior Inglese, I under
stand you, says he, but Seignior Chinese understood you his own
way.
Well, says I, Seignior, do you think it would stand out an Army of
our Country People, with a good Train of Artillery; or our Engineers,
with two Companies of Miners; would not they batter it down in
ten Days, that an Army might enter in Battalia, or blow it up in the
Air, Foundation and all, that there should be no Sign of it left? Ah,
ah, says he, I know that The Chinese wanted mightily to know
what I said, and I gave him leave to tell him a few Days after, for we
were then almost out of their Country, and he was to leave us in a
little time afterward; but when he knew what I had said, he was
dumb all the rest of the way, and we heard no more of his fine Story
of the Chinese Power and Greatness, while he stayed.
After we had passed this mighty Nothing called a Wall, something
like the Picts Wall, so famous in Northumberland, and built by the
Romans, we began to find the Country thinly inhabited, and the
People rather confin'd to live in fortify'd Towns and Cities, as being
subject to the Inroads and Depredations of the Tartars, who rob in
great Armies, and therefore are not to be resisted by the naked Inha-
bitants of an open Country.
And here I began to find the Necessity of keeping together in a
Caravan as we travell'd; for we saw several Troops of Tartars
roving about; but when I came to see them distinctly, I wonder'd
more that the Chinese Empire could be conquer'd by such con-
temptible Fellows; for they are a mere Horde or Crowd of wild
Fellows, keeping no Order, and understanding no Discipline, or
manner of Fight
Their Horses are poor lean starved Creatures, taught nothing, and
fit for nothing; and this we said, the first Day we saw them, which
was after we enter'd the wilder Part of the Country; our Leader for
the Day gave Leave for about sixteen of us to go a hunting, as they
call it; and what was this, but hunting of Sheep; however, it may
be called hunting too; for the Creatures are the wildest and swiftest
of Foot that ever I saw of their Kind; only they will not run a great
way, and you are sure of Sport when you begin the Chase; for they
appear generally thirty or forty in a Flock, and like true Sheep,
always keep together when they fly.
"In Pursuit of this odd sort of Game, it was our hap to meet with
about forty Tartars; whether they were hunting Mutton as we were,
or whether they looked for another kind of Prey, I know not; but
as soon as they saw us, one of them blew a kind of a Horn very loud,
but with a barbarous Sound, that I had never heard before, and by
the way, never care to hear again: we all suppos'd this was to
call their Friends about them, and so it was; for in less than Half
a Quarter of an Hour, a Troop of forty or fifty more appear'd,
M about a Mile Distance, but our Work was over first, as it
happen'd.
One of the Scots Merchants of Moscow happen'd to be amongst us,
and as soon as he heard the Horn, he told us in short, that we had
nothing to do, but to charge them immediately without loss of Time;
and drawing us up in a Line, he asked if we were resolv'd? We told
him we were ready to follow him; so he rode directly up to them:
they stood gazing at us like a mere Crowd, drawn up in no Order,
nor showing the Face of any Order at all; but as soon as they saw
us advance, they let fly their Arrows, which however missed us
very happily; it seems they mistook not their Aim, but their
Distance; for their Arrows all fell a little short of us, but with so
true an Aim, that had we been about twenty yards nearer, we must
have had several Men wounded, if not killed.
Immediately we halted, and though it was at a great Distance, we
fired, and sent them Leaden Bullets for Wooden Arrows, following
our Shot full Gallop, to fall in among them Sword in Hand, for so
our bold Scot that led us directed; He was indeed but a Merchant,
but he behav'd with that Vigour and Bravery on this occasion, and
yet, with such a cool Courage too, that I never saw any Man in
Action fitter for Command. As soon as we came up to them, we
fired our Pistols in their Faces, and then drew; but they fled in the
greatest Confusion imaginable; the only Stand any of them made,
was on our Right, where three of them stood, and by signs called
the rest to come back to them, having a kind of Scimitar in their
Hands, and their Bows hanging at their Backs. Our brave Com-
mander, without asking anybody to follow him, gallops up close to
them, and with his Fuzee knocks one of them off his Horse, killed
the second with his Pistol, and the third ran away, and thus ended
our Fight: but we had this Misfortune attending it, (viz.) that all
our Mutton that we had in chase, got away: We had not a Man
killed or hurt; but as for the Tartars, there was about five of them
killed; who were wounded, we knew not; but this we knew, that
the other Party was so frighted with the Noise of our Guns, that they
made off, and never made any Attempt upon us.
We were all this while in the Chinese Dominion, and therefore the
Tartars were not so bold as afterwards; but in about five Days we
enter'd a vast great wild Desert, which held us three Days' and
Nights' March; and we were oblig'd to carry our Water with us in
great Leather Bottles, and to encamp all Night, just as I have heard
they do in the Desert of Arabia.
I asked whose Dominion this was in, and they told me, this was a
kind of Border, that might be called no Man's Land; being a Part of
the Great Karakathie, or Grand Tartary, but that however it was all
reckon'd to China; but that there was no Care taken here, to pre-
serve it from the Inroads of Thieves, and therefore it was reckon'd
the worst Desert in the whole World; though we were to go over some
much larger.
In passing this Wilderness, which I confess was at the first very
frightful to me, we saw two or three times little Parties of the
Tartars, but they seemed to be upon their own Affairs, and to have
no Design upon us; and so like the Man who met the Devil, if they
had nothing to say to us, we had nothing to say to them; we let
them go.
Once however, a Party of them came so near, as to stand and gaze
at us; whether it was to consider what they should do, whether attar*,
as, or not attack us, that we knew not; but when we were passed at
some distance by them, we made a Rear-Guard of forty men, and
stood ready for them, letting the Caravan pass half a Mile, or there-
abouts, before us; but after a while they marched off, only we found
they saluted us with five Arrows at their Parting; one of which
wounded a Horse so, that it disabled him; and we left him the next
Day, poor Creature, in great need of a good Farrier; we suppose
they might shoot more Arrows, which might fall short of us, but we
saw no more Arrows or Tartars that time.
We travell'd near a Month after this, the Ways being not so good as
at first, though still in the Dominions of the Emperor of China, but
lay for the most part in Villages, some of which were fortify'd, because
of the Incursions of the Tartars. When we came to one of these
Towns, (it was about two Days and a Half Journey before we were to
come to the City Nauni) I wanted to buy a Camel, of which there are
plenty to be sold all the way upon that Road, and of Horses als*\
such as they are, because so many Caravans coming that way, they
are often wanted: The Person that I spoke to to get me a Camel,
would have gone and fetched it for me, but I like a Fool must be
officious, and go myself along with him: The Place was about two
Miles out of the Village, where, it seems, they kept the Camels and
Horses feeding under a Guard.
I walked it on Foot with my old Pilot, being very desirous, for-
sooth, of a little Variety: When we came to the Place, it was a low
marshy Ground, walled round with a stone Wall, piled up dry, without
Mortar or Earth among it, like a Park, with a little Guard of Chinese
Soldiers at the Door. Having bought a Camel, and agreed for the
Price, I came away, and the Chinese man that went with me, led the
Camel; when on a sudden came up five Tartars on Horseback; two
of them seized the Fellow, and took the Camel from him, while
other three stepped up to me; and my old Pilot, seeing us as it were
unarmed, for I had no Weapon about me but my Sword, which could
but ill defend me against three Horsemen; the first that came up,
stopped short upon my drawirg my Sword, (for they are errant
Cowards); but a Second coming upon my Left, gave me a Blow on the
Head, which I aever felt till afterward, and wondered when I came
to myself, what was the matter with me, and where I was, for he
laid me flat on the Ground; but my never failing old Pilot, the Portu-
guese (so Providence unlooked for directs Deliverances from Dangers,
which to us are unforeseen) had a Pistol in his Pocket, which I knew
nothing of, nor the Tartars; neither if they had, I suppose they
would not have attack'd us: But Cowards are always boldest when
there is no Danger.
The old Man seeing me down, with a bold Heart stepped up to the
Fellow that had struck me, and laying hold of his Arm with one Hand,
and pulling him down by main Force a little towards him with the
other, shot him into the Head, and laid him dead upon the Spot;
he then immediately stepped up to him who had stopped us, as I
said, and before he could come forward again, (for it was all done as
it were in a moment) made a Blow at him with a Scimitar which he
always wore, but missing the Man, cut his Horse into the Side of his
Head, cut one of his Ears off by the Root, and a great Slice down the
Side of his Face; the poor Beast enraged with the Wound, was no
more to be govern'd by his Rider, though the Fellow sat well enough
too; but away he flew, andcarryYlhim quite oirt of the Pilot's Reach.
Mid at some Distance rising up upon his hind Legs, threw down the
Tartar, and fell upon him.
In this Interval, the poor Chinese came in, who had lost the Camel,
but he had no Weapon; however, seeing the Tartar down, and his
Horse fallen upon him, away he runs to him, and seizing upon an
ugly ill-favour'd Weapon he had by his Side, something like a Pole-
axe, but not a Pole-axe neither, he wrenched it from him, and made
shift to knock his Tartarian Brains out with it But my old Man
had the third Tartar to deal with still, and seeing he did not fly, as
he expected, nor come on to fight him, as he apprehended, but stand
stock still, the old Man stood still too, and falls to work with his
Tackle to charge his Pistol again; but as soon as the Tartar saw the
Pistol, whether he suppos'd it to be the same, or another, I know not,
but away he scoured, and left my Pilot, my Champion I called him
afterward, a complete Victory.
By this time I was a little awake, for I thought when first I began
to wake, that I had been in a sweet Sleep; but as I said above, I
wonder'd where I was, how I came upon the Ground, and what was
the matter: In a word, a few moments after, as Sense return'd, I
felt Pain, though I did not know where; I clapped my Hand to my
Head, and took it away bloody; then I felt my Head ache, and then
in another Moment, Memory return'd, and everything was present to
me again.
I jumped up upon my Feet instantly, and got hold of my Sword,
but no Enemies in view: I found a Tartar lie dead and his Horse
standing very quietly by him; and looking farther, I saw my Cham-
pion and Deliverer, who had been to see what the Chinese had done,
coming back with his Hanger in his Hand; the old Man seeing me
on my Feet, came running to me and embrac'd me with a great deal
of Joy, being afraid before that I had been killed, and seeing me
bloody, would see how I was hurt, but it was not much, only what
we call a broken Head; neither did I afterwards find any great In-
convenience from the Blow, other than the Place which was hurt, and
which was well again in two or three Days.
We made no great Gain however by this Victory, for we lost a
Camel, and gained a Horse; but that which was remarkable, when
we came back to the Village, the Man demanded to be paid for the
Camel. I disputed it, and it was brought to a hearing before the
Chinese Judge of the Place; that is to say, in English, we went before
a Justice of the Peace: Give him his due, he acted with a great deal
of Prudence and Impartiality; and having heard both Sides, he
gravely asked the Chinese Man, that went with me to buy the Camel,
whose Servant he was? I am no Servant, says he, but went with the
Stranger. At whose Request? says the Justice. At the Stranger's
Request, says he. Why then, says the Justice, you were the
Stranger's Servant for the Time, and the Camel being deliver'd to bis
Servant, it was deliver'd to him, and he must pay for it
I confess the Thing was so clear, that I had not a Word to say; but
admiring to see such just Reasoning upon the Consequence, and so
accurate stating the Cause, I paid willingly for the Camel, and sent for
another; but you may observe, I sent for it, I did not go to fetch it
myself any more; I had enough of that
The City of Naum is a Frontier of the Chinese Empire; they call
it fortified, and so it is, as Fortifications go there; for this I will ven-
ture to affirm, that all the Tartars in Karakathie, which I believe are
some Millions, could not batter down the Walls with their Bows and
Arrows; but to call it strong, if it were attack'd with Cannon, would
be to make those who understand it, laugh at you.
We wanted, as I have said, above two Days' Journey of this City,
when Messengers were sent Express to every Part of the Road, to
tell all Travellers and Caravans, to halt till they had a Guard
sent for them; for that an unusual Body of Tartars, making ten
thousand in all, had appear^ in the Way, about thirty Miles beyond
the City.
This was very bad News to Travellers; however, it was carefully
done of the Governor, and we were very glad to hear we should have
a Guard; accordingly, two Days after, we had two hundred Soldiers
sent us from a Garrison of the Chinese, on our left, and three hundred
more from the City of Naum, and with those we advanced boldly.
The three hundred Soldiers from Naum marched in our Front, the
two hundred in our Rear, and our Men on each Side of our Camels
with our Baggage, and the whole Caravan in the Centre; in this
Order, and well prepar'd for Battle, we thought ourselves a Match
for the whole ten thousand Mongol Tartars, if they had appear'd; but
the next day when they did appear, it was quite another thing.
It was early in the Morning, when marching from a little well
situated Town called Changu, we had a River to pass, where we were
oblig'd to ferry \ and had the Tartars had any Intelligence, then had
DEFEAT OF TARTARS
been the Time to have attack'd us, when the Caravan being over, the
Rear-Guard was behind; but they did not appear.
About three Hours after, when we were enter'd upon a Desert of
about fifteen or sixteen Miles over, behold, by a Cloud of Dust they
raised, we saw an Enemy was at Hand, and they were at Hand indeed,
for they came on upon the Spur.
The Chinese, our Guard on the Front, who had talked so big the
Day before, began to stagger, and the Soldiers frequently looked
behind them, which is a certain Sign in a Soldier, that he is just ready
to run away; my old Pilot was of my mind; and being near me, he
called out, Seignior Inglese, says he, those Fellows must be encourag'd,
or they will ruin us all; for if the Tartars come on, they will never
stand it: I am of your Mind, said I, but what Course must be done t
Done! says he, let fifty of our Men advance, and flank them on each
Wing, and encourage them, and they will fight like brave Fellows in
brave Company; but without, they will every man turn his back;
immediately I rode up to our Leader, and told him, who was exactly
of our mind; and accordingly, fifty of us marched to the right Wing,
and fifty to the left, and the rest made a Line of Rescue; and so we
inarched, leaving the last two hundred Men to make another Body
by themselves, and to guard the Camels; only that if need were, they
should send a hundred Men, to assist the last fifty.
In a word, the Tartars came on, and an innumerable Company
they were; how many, we could not tell, but ten thousand we thought
was the least: A Party of them came on first, and viewed our
Posture, traversing the Ground in the Front of our Line; and as we
found them within Gun-shot, our Leader order^ the two Wings to
advance swiftly, and give them a Salvo on each Wing with their Shot,
which was done; but they went off, and I suppose back to give an
Account of the Reception they were like to meet with: and indeed
that Salute clogged their Stomach, for they immediately halted, stood
awhile to consider of it, and wheeling off to the left, they gave over
the Design, and said no more to us for that time; which was verj
agreeable to our Circumstances, which were but very indifferent for *
Battle with such a Number.
Two Days after this, we came to the City Nairn, or Naum; we
thanked the Governor for his Care for us, and collected to the Value
of a hundred Crowns, or thereabouts, which we gave to the Soldiers
sent to guard us; and here we rested one Day. This is a Garrison
indeed, and there were nine hundred Soldiers kept here; but the
Reason of it was, that formerly the Muscovite Frontiers lay nearer to
them than they do now, the Muscovites having abandon'd that Part of
Ihe Country (which lies from this City West, for about two hundred
Miles) as desolate and unfit for Use; and more especially, being so
very remote, and so difficult to send Troops thither for its Defence;
for we had yet above two thousand Miles to Muscovy, properly so
called.
After this, we passed several great Rivers, and two dreadful Deserts,
one of which we were sixteen Days passing over, and which, as I said,
was to be called no Maris Land; and on the 13 th of Aprilwe came
to the Frontiers of the Muscovite Dominions: I think the first City, or
Town, or Fortress, whatever it might be called, that belong'd to
the Czar of Muscovy, was called Argun, being on the West Side of
the River Argun.
I could not but discover an infinite Satisfaction, that I was soon
arriv'd in, as I called it, a Christian Country, or at least in a Country
govern'd by Christians; for though the Muscovites do, in my Opinion,
but just deserve the Name of Christians, yet such they pretend to be,
and are very devout in their Way: It would certainly occur to any
Man who travels the World as I have done, and who had any
Power of Reflection; I say, it would occur to him, to reflect what a
Blessing it is to be brought into the World, where the Name of God,
and of a Redeemer is known, worshipp'd and ador^; and not where
the People given up by Heaven to strong Delusions, worship the
Devil, and prostrate themselves to Stocks and Stones, worship
Monsters, Elements, horrible shaped Animals, and Statues, or Images
of Monsters: not a Town or City we passed through, but had their
Pagodas, their Idols, and their Temples, and ignorant People worship-
ping, even the Works of their own Hands.
Now we came where at least a Face of the Christian Worship ap-
pear'd, where the Knee was bowed to Jesus; and whether ignorantly
or not, yet the Christian Religion was owned, and the Name of the
true God was called upon, and ador'd; and it made the very Re-
cesses of my Soul rejoice to see it: I saluted the brave Scots Merchant
I mention'd above, with my first acknowledgment of this; and taking
him by the Hand, I said to him, Blessed be God, we are once again
come among Christians: He smiled, and answer'd, Do not rejoice
too soon, Countryman, these Muscovites are but an odd sort of
Christians; and but for the Name of it, you may see very little of the
Substance, for some Months farther of our Journey.
Well, says I, but still it is better than Paganism, and worshipping oi
Devils. Why, I'll tell you, says he, except the Russian Soldiers in
Garrisons, and a few of the Inhabitants of the Cities upon the Road,
all the rest of this Country, for above a thousand Miles faither, is
inhabited by the worst and most ignorant of Pagans; and so indeed
we found it
We were now launched into the greatest Piece of solid Earth, if I
understand anything of the Surface of the Globe, that is to be found
in any Part of the Earth; we had at least twelve hundred Miles to the
Sea, Eastward; we had at least two Thousand to the Bottom of the
Baltic Sea, Westward; and above three thousand Miles, if we left
that Sea, and went on West to the British and French Channels:
We had full five thousand Miles to the Indian, or Persian Sea, South;
and about eight hundred Miles to the Frozen Sea, North; nay, if
some People may be believ'd, there might be no Sea North-East,
till we came round the Pole, and consequently into the North-West,
and so had a Continent of Land into America., the Lord knows where,
though I could give some Reasons why I believe that to be a
Mistake.
As we enter'd into the Muscovite Dominions, a good while before
we come to any considerable Towns, we had nothing to observe there
but this; first, that all the Rivers that run to the East, as I under-
stood by the Charts, which some in our Caravan had with them; it
was plain, all those Rivers ran into the Great River Yamour, or Gam-
mour: This River, by the natural Course of it, must run into the East
Sea, or Chinese Ocean. The Story they tell us, that the Mouth of
this River is choked up with Bull-rushes, of a monstrous Growth,
(viz.) three Foot about, and twenty or thirty Foot high, I must be
allow'd to say, I believe nothing of; but as its Navigation is of no Use,
because there is no Trade that way, the Tartars, to whom alone it
belongs, dealing in nothing but Cattle, so Nobody that ever I heard
of, has been curious enough, either to go down to the Mouth of it in
Boats, or come up from the Mouth of it in Ships; but this is certain,
that this River running due East, in the Latitude of [about 50
degrees] carries a vast Concourse of Rivers along with it, and finds an
Ocean to empty itself in that Latitude; so we are sure of Sea there.
Some Leagues to the North of this River, there are several con-
siderable Rivers, whose Streams run as due North as the Yamour
runs East, and these are all found to join their Waters with the Great
River Tartarus, named so, from the northernmost Nations of the
Mongol Tartars, who the Chinese say, were the first Tartars in the
World; and who, as our Geographers allege, are the Gog and Magog
mention'd in sacred Story.
These Rivers running all Northward, as well as all the other Rivers
I am yet to speak of, make it evident, that the Northern Ocean
bounds the Land also on that Side; so that it does not seem rational
in the least to think, that the Land can extend itself to join with
America on that side, or that there is not a Communication between
the Northern and the Eastern Ocean; but of this I shall say no more,
it was my Observation at that time, and therefore I take Notice of it
in this Place. We now advanc'd from the River Arguna by easy and
moderate Journeys, and were very visibly oblig'd to the Care the Czar
of Muscovy has taken to have Cities and Towns built in as many
Places as are possible to place them, where his Soldiers keep Garrison
something like the Stationary Soldiers placed by the Romans in the re-
motest Countries of their Empire, some of which I had read partial-
larly were placed in Britain for the Security of Commerce, and fol
the lodging Travellers; and thus it was here; for wherever we came,
though at these Towns and Stations, the Garrisons and Governor were
Russians, and profess'd Christians, yet the Inhabitants of the Country
were mere Pagans, sacrificing to Idols, and worshipping the Sun,
Moon, and Stars, or all the Host of Heaven, and not only so, but
were of all the Heathens and Pagans that ever I met with, the most
barbarous, except only that they did not eat Man's Flesh, as our
Savages of America did.
Some Instances of this we met with in the Country between Arguna,
where we enter the Muscovite Dominions, and a City of Tartars and
Russians together, called Nortzinskoy, in which is a continu'd Desert
or Forest, which cost us twenty Days to travel over it; in a Village near
the last of those Places I had the Curiosity to go and see their Way
of Living, which is most brutish and insufferable ; they had I suppose
a. great Sacrifice that Day, for there stood out upon an old Stump of
a Tree, an Idol made of Wood, frightful as the Devil, at least as any-
thing we can think of to represent the Devil, can be made; it had a
Head certainly not so much as resembling any Creature that the
World ever saw \ Ears as big as Goat's Horns, and as high; Eyes as
big as a Crown-riece; a Nose like a crooked Ram's Horn, and a
Mouth extended four corner'd, like that of a Lion, with horrible Teeth,
hooked like a Parrot's under Bill; it was dressed up in the filthiest
manner that you could suppose; its upper Garment was of Sheep-
Skins, with the Wool outward, a great Tartar Bonnet on the Head,
with two Horns growing through it; it was about eight Foot high, yet
had no Feet or Legs, or any other Proportion of Parts.
This Scare-crow was set up at the outer Side of the Village, and when
I came near to it, there were sixteen or seventeen Creatures, whether
Men or Women, I could not tell, for they make no Distinction by
their Habits, either of Body or Head : These lay all flat on the Ground,
round this formidable Block of shapeless Wood: I saw no Motion
among them any more than if they had been all Logs of Wood like
the Idol, and at first, really thought they had been so; but when I
came a little nearer, they started up upon their Feet, and raised a
howling Cry, as if it had been so many deep-mouthed Hounds, and
walked away as if they were displeas'd at our disturbing them:
A little way off from the Idol, and at the Door of that Terit or Hut,
made all of Sheep-Skins and Cow-Skins, dried, stood three Butchers,
I thought they were such; when I came nearer to them, I found they
had long Knives in their Hands, and in the middle of the Tent ap-
pear'd three Sheep killed, and one young Bullock or Steer: These
it seems, were Sacrifices to that senseless Log of an Idol, and these
three Men, Priests belonging to it; and the seventeen prostrated
Wretches were the People who brought the Offering, and were
making their Prayers to that Stock.
I confess I was more moved at their Stupidity and brutish Wop
ship of a Hobgoblin, than ever I was at anything in my Life; to see
God's most glorious and best Creature, to whom he had granted so
many Advantages, even by Creation, above the rest of the Works of
his Hands, vested with a reasonable Soul, and that Soul adorn'd with
Faculties and Capacities, adapted both to honour his Maker, and be
honour'd by him, sunk and degenerated to a Degree so more than
stupid, as to prostrate itself to a frightful Nothing, a mere imaginary
Object dressed up by themselves, and made terrible to themselves by
their own Contrivance; adorn'd only with Clouts and Rags ; and that
this should be the Effect of mere Ignorance, wrought up into hellish
Devotion by the Devil himself; who envying (to his Maker) the
Homage and Adoration of his Creatures, had deluded them into such
gross, surfeiting, sordid, and brutish things, as one would think
should shock Nature itself.
But what signify'd all the Astonishment and Reflection of Thoughts?
thus it was, and I saw it before my Eyes, and there was no room to
wonder at it, or think it impossible; all my Admiration turned tc
Rage, and I rid up to the Image, or Monster, call it what you will, and
with my Sword cut the Bonnet that was on its Head in two in the
middle, so that it hung down by one of the Horns; and one of our
Men that was with me took hold of the Sheep-Skin that cover'd it, and
pulled at it, when behold a most hideous Outcry and Howling run
through the Village, and two or three hundred People came about my
Ears, so that I was glad to scour for it; for we saw some had Bows
and Arrows; but I resolv'd from that moment to visit them again.
Our Caravan rested three Nights at the Town, which was about
four Miles off, in order to provide some Horses which they wanted,
several of the Horses having been lamed, and jaded with the badness
of the Way and long March over the last Desert; so we had some
Leisure here to put my Design in Execution: I communicated my
Project to the Scots Merchant of Moscow, of whose Courage I had
had sufficient Testimony, as above: I told him what I had seen, and
with what Indignation I had since thought that human Nature could
be so degenerate: I told him, I was resolv'd if I could get but four or
five Men well armed to go with me, I was resolv'd to go and destroy
that vile, abominable Idol, and let them see that it had no Power to
help itself, and consequently could not be an Object of Worship, or
be prayed to, much less help them that offer'd Sacrifices to it
He laughed at me; says he, Your Zeal may be good, but what do
you propose to yourself by it? Propose, said I, to vindicate the
Honour of God, which is insulted by this Devil Worship. But how
will it vindicate the Honour of God ? said /u. While the People will
not be able to know what you mean by it, unless you could speak to
them and tell them so, and then they will fight you, and beat you too,
I'll assure you, for they are desperate Fellows, and that especially is
Defence of their Idolatry. Can we not, said I, do it in the Night,
and then leave them the Reasons and Causes in Writing in their own
Language? Writing! said he, why there is not a Man in five Nations
of them that know anything of a Letter, or how to read a Word in any
Language, or in their own. Wretched Ignorance! said I to him;
however I have a great mind to do it; perhaps Nature may draw In-
ferences from it to them, to let them see how brutish they are, to wor-
ship such horrid Things. Look you, Sir, said he, if your Zeal prompts
you to it so warmly, you must do it; but in the next place I would have
you consider, these wild Nations of People are subjected by Force to
the Czar of Muscovy's Dominions, and if you do this, it is ten to one
but they will come by Thousands to the Governor of Nortsinskoy,
and complain, and demand Satisfaction; and if he cannot give them
Satisfaction, it is ten to one but they revolt, and will occasion a new
War with all the Tartars in the Country.
This, I confess, put new Thoughts into my Head for a while; but
I harped upon the same String still, and all that Day I was uneasy to
put my Project in Execution: Towards the Evening the Scots Merchant
met me by Accident in our Walk about the Town, and desir'd to
speak with me; I believe, said he, I have put you off of your good
Design; I have been a little concern'd about it since, for I abhor the
Idol and the Idolatry as much as you can do: Truly, says I, you have
put it off a little as to the Execution of it, but you have not put it all
out of my Thoughts, and I believe I shall do it still before I quit this
Place, though I were to be deliver'd up to them for Satisfaction. N o,
no, says he, God forbid they should deliver you up to such a Crew of
Monsters; they shall not do that neither, that would be murdering
you indeed. Why, says I, how would they use me? Use you! says
he; I'll tell you how they served a poor Russian, who affronted them
in their Worship just as you did, and who they took Prisoner; after
they had lamed him with an Arrow that he could not run away, they
took him and stripped him stark naked, and set him up on the top of
the Idol Monster, and stood all around him, and shot as many Arrows
into him as would stick over his whole Body, and then they burnt
him and all the Arrows sticking in him as a Sacrifice to the Idol.
And was this the same Idol? Yes, says he, the very same. Well,
tays I, I'll tell you a Story; so I related the Story of our Men at
Madagascar, and how they burnt and sacked the Village there, and
killed Man, Woman, and Child, for their murdering one of our Men,
just as it is related before; and when I had done, I added, that I
thought we ought to do so to this Village.
He listen'd very attentively to the Story; but when I talked of
doing so to that Village, says he, You mistake very much, it was not
*his Village, it was almost a hundred Mile from this place, but it was
the same Idol, for they carry him about in Procession all over the
ADVENTURES OF
Country: Well, then, says I, then that Idol ought to be punish'tl foi
it, and it shall, says I, if I live this Night out
In a word, finding me resolute, he liked the Design, and told me
I should not go alone, but he would go with me, and bring a stout
Fellow, one of his Countrymen, to go also with us; and one, says he,
as famous for his Zeal as you can desire any one to be, against such
Devilish things as these. In a word, he brought me his Comrade, a
Scotsman, whom he called Captain Richardson, and I gave him a full
account of what I had seen; and in a word, of what I intended;
and he told me readily, he would go with me if it cost him his Life;
so we agreed to go only us three. I had indeed propos'd it to my
Partner, but he declin'd it; he said, he was ready to assist me to the
utmost, and upon all occasions for my defence; but that this was an
Adventure quite out of his Way; so, I say, we resolv'd upon our
Work only us three and my Man-Servant, and to put it in Execution
that Night about Midnight, with all the Secrecy imaginable.
However, upon second Thoughts, we were willing to delay it till
the next Night, because the Caravan being to set forward in the
Morning, we suppos'd the Governor could not pretend to give them
any Satisfaction upon us when we were out of his Power. The Scots
Merchant, as steady in his Resolution for the Enterprise, as bold in
executing, brought me a Tartar's Robe or Gown of the Sheep-Skins,
and a Bonnet, with a Bow and Arrows, and had provided the same
for himself and his Countryman, that the People, if they saw us,
should not be able to determine who we were.
All the first Night we spent in mixing up some combustible Matter
with Aqua-viUe, Gunpowder, and such other Materials as we could
get, and having a good Quantity of Tar in a little Pot, about an
Hour after Night we set out upon our Expedition.
We came to the Place about eleven o'Clock at Night, and found
that the People had not the least Jealousy of Danger attending their
Idol: the Night was cloudy, yet the Moon gave us Light enough to
see that the Idol stood just in the same Posture and Place that it did
before: The People seemed to be all at their Rest, only, that in the
great Hut, or Tent, as we called it, where we saw the three Priests,
whom we mistook for Butchers, we saw a Light, and going up close
to the Door, we heard People talking, as if there were five or six of
them; we concluded therefore, that if we set the Wild-nre to the
idol, these Men would come out immediately, and run up to t^e
Place to fescue it from the Destruction that we intended for it, and
what to do with them we knew not; once we thought of carrying it
away and setting Fire to it at a Distance; but when we came to
handle it, we found it too bulky for our Carriage, so we were at a
Loss again: The second Scotsman was for setting Fire to the Tent
or Hut, and knocking the Creatures that were there on the Head
when they came out; but I could not join with that; I was against
killing them, if it was possible to be avoided: Well then, said the
Scots Merchant, I'll tell you what we will do, we will try to take them
Prisoners, tie their Hands behind them, and make them stand still,
and see their Idol destroy'd.
As it happen'd, we had Twine or Packthread enough about us,
which was used to tie our Fire-Works together; so we resolv'd to
attack these People first, and with as little Noise as we could: The
first Thing we did, we knocked at the Doer, which issued just as we
desir'd it; for one of their Idol Priests came to the Door: we imme-
diately seized upon him, stopped his Mouth, and tied his Hands
behind him, and led him to the Idol, where we gagged him, that he
might not make a Noise; tied his Feet also together, and left him on
the Ground.
Two of us then waited at the Door, expecting that another would
come out to see what the Matter was; but we waited so long till the
third Man came back to us; and then nobody coming out, we
knocked again gently, and immediately out came two more, and we
served them just in the same manner, but were oblig'd to go all with
them, and lay them down by the Idol some Distance from one
another; when going back, we found two more were come out to the
Door, and a third more stood behind them within the Door: We seized
the two, and immediately tied them, when the third stepping back,
and crying out, my Scots Merchant went in after him, and taking out
a Composition we had made, that would only smoke and stink, he
set Fire to it, and threw it in among them; by that Time the other
Scotsman and my Man taking Charge of the two Men who were
already bound, and tied together also by the Arm, led them away to
the Idol, and left them there, to see if their Idol would relieve them
making Haste back to us.
When the Fuze we had thrown in had filled the Hut with so much
Smoke that they were almost suffocated, we then threw in a small
Leather Bag of another Kind, which flamed like a Candle, and
following it in, we found there was but four People left, who, ft seems,
were two Men and two Women; and, as we suppos'd, had been
about some of their Diabolic Sacrifices: They appear'd, in short;
frighted to Death, at least so as to sit trembling and stupid, and not
able to speak neither, for the Smoke.
In a word, we took them, bound them as we had the other, and
all without any Noise: I should have said, we brought them out of
the House or Hut first; for indeed we were not able to bear the
Smoke any more than they were. When we had done this, we
carry'd them all together to the Idol: when we came there, we fell
to work with him; and first we daubed him all over, and his Robes
also, with Tar and such other Stuff as we had, which was Tallow
mixed with Brimstone; then we stopped his Eyes, and Ears, and Mouth
full of Gunpowder, and then we wrapped up a great piece of Wild-
fire in his Bonnet, and then sticking all the Combustibles we had
brought with us upon him, we looked about to see if we could find
anything else to help to burn him, when my Man remember'd, that
by the Tent or Hut where the Men were, there lay a heap of dry
Forage, whether Straw or Rushes I do not remember; away he and
one of the Scotsmen run, and fetched their Arms full of that: When
we had done this, we took all our Prisoners, and brought them,
having unty'd their Feet, and ungagg'd their Mouths, and made them
stand up, and set them just before their monstrous Idol, and then
set fire to the whole.
We stayed by it a quarter of an Hour, or thereabouts, till the
Powder in the Eyes, and Mouth, Fjid Ears of the Idol blew up, and
we could perceive had split and deform'd the Shape; and in a word,
till we saw it burn into a mere Block or Log of Wood: and then
setting the dry Forage to it, we found it would be quite consumed,
when we began to think of going away; but the Scotsman said no, we
must not go, for these poor deluded Wretches will all throw them-
selves into the Fire, and burn themselves with the Idol; so we re-
solv'd to stay till the Forage was burnt down too, and then we came
away and left them.
In the Morning we appear'd among our Fellow Travellers exceed-
ing busy, in getting ready for our Journey; nor could any Man
suggest that we had been anywhere but in our Beds, as Travellers
might be suppos'd to be, to fit themselves for the Fatigues of thai
Day's Journey.
But it did not end so; the next Day came a great Multitude of
the Country People, not only of this Village, but of a hundred more,
for aught I know, to the Town-Gates, and in a most outrageous
manner, demanded Satisfaction of the Russian Governor, for the in-
sulting their Priests, and burning their Great Cham-Chi-Thaungu;
such a hard Name they gave the monstrous Creature they worshipp'd;
the People of Nortsinskoy were at first in a great Consternation, for
they said, the Tartars were no less than thirty thousand, and that in
a few Days more, vrauld be one hundred thousand strong.
The Russian Governor sent out Messengers to appease them, and
gave them all the good words imaginable: He assur'd them, he
knew nothing of it, and that there had not a Soul of his Garrison been
abroad: that it could not be from anybody there; and if they would
let him know who it was, they should be exemplarily punish'd. They
/eturn'd haughtily, that all the Country reverenc'd the Great Cham-
Chi-Thaungu,Y?ho dwelt in the Sun, and no Mortal would have decreed
to offer Violence to his Image, but some Christian Miscreant, so they
called them, it seems; and they therefore denounc'd War against
him, and all the Russians, who, they said, were Miscreants and
Christians.
The Governor still patient, and unwilling to make a Breach, or to
have any Cause of War alleged to be given by him, the Czar having
straitly charged them to treat the conquer'd Country with Gentleness
and Civility, gave them still all the good Words he could; at last he
told them, there was a Caravan gone towards Russia that Morning,
and perhaps it was some of them, who had done them this Injury;
and that if they would be satisfied with that, he would send after them,
to inquire into it: This seemed to appease them a little; and accord-
ingly the Governor sent after us, and gave us a particular Account
how the Thing was; intimating withal, that if any in our Caravan had
done it, they should make their Escape; but that whether they had
done it or no, we should make all the haste forward that was possible
and that in the meantime he would keep them in play as long as he
could.
This was very friendly in the Governor; however, when it came to
the Caravan, there was nobody knew anything of the Matter. And
as for us that were guilty, we were the least of all suspected; none so
much as asked us the Question; however, the Captain of the Caravar
tor tne Time, took Uie Hint that the Governor g»ve us, and we
marched or travell'd two Days and two Nights, without any consider-
able Stop; and then we lay at a Village called Plothus; nor did
make any long Stop here, but hasten'd on towards Jarawena, another
of the Czar of Muscovy's Colonies, and where we expected we should
be safe; but it is to be observ'd, that here we began for two or three
Days' March, to enter upon the vast nameless Desert, of which I shall
say more in its Place; and which, if we had now been upon it, it is
more than probable, we had been all destroy'd: It was the second
Day's March from Plothus, that by the Clouds of Dust behind us at
a great Distance, some of our People began to be sensible we were
pursu'd ; we had enter'd the Desert, and had passed by a great Lake
called, Sehaks-Oser, when we perceiv'd a very great Body of Horse
appear on the other Side of the Lake to the North, we travelling West:
We observ'd they went away West as we did, but had suppos'd we
would have taken that Side of the Lake, whereas, we very happily
took the South Side; and in two Days more, we saw them not, for
tbey believing we were still before them, pushed on till they came to
the river Udda; this is a very great River when it passes farther
North; but where we came to it, we found it narrow, and fordable.
The third Day they either found their Mistake, or had Intelligence
of us, and came pouring in upon us, towards the Dusk of the Even-
ing: We had, to our great Satisfaction, just pitched upon a Place for
our Camp, which was very convenient for the Night; for as we were
upon a Desert, though but at the beginning of it, that was above five
hundred Miles over, we had no Towns to lodge at, and indeed ex-
pected none but the City Jarawena, which we had yet two Days'
March to; the Desert however, had some few Woods in it on this
Side, and little Rivers, which ran all into the great river Udda: It was
in a narrow Strait between two little, but very thick Woods, that we
pitched our little Camp for that Night, expecting to be attack'd in the
Night
Nobody knew but ourselves, what we were pursu'd for; but as it
was usual for the Mongol Tartars to go about in Troops in that Desert,
so the Caravans always fortify themselves every Night against them,
as against Armies of Robbers; and it was therefore no new thing to
be pursu'd.
But we had this Night, of all the Nights of our Travels, a most
advantageous Camp; for we lay between two Woods, with a littl<
Rivulet running just before our Front; so that we could not be sup
rounded, or attack'd any way, but in our Front or Rear; we took
care also to make our Front as strong as we could, by placing our
Packs, with our Camels and Horses, all in a Line on the Inside of
the River, and felling some Trees in our Rear.
In this Posture we encamp'd for the Night, but the Enemy was
upon us before we had finish'd our Situation: They did not come on
us like Thieves as we expected, but sent three Messengers to us, to
demand the Men to be deliver'd to them, that had abus'd their
Priests, and burnt their God, Cham- Chi-Thaungu with Fire, that they
might bur n them with Fire; and upon this, they said they would go
away, and do us no farther harm: otherwise, they would burn us all
with Fire. Our Men looked very blank at this Message, and began to
stare at one another, to see who looked with most Guilt in their Faces;
but nobody war< the Word, nobody did it The Leader of the Caravan
sent Word, he was well assur'd, it was not done by any of our Camp;
that we were peaceable Merchants, travelling on our Business; that
we had done no harm to them, or to any one else; and that there-
fore, they must look farther for their Enemies who had injur'd them,
for we were not the People; so desir'd them not to disturb us, for
if they did, we should defend ourselves.
They were far from being satisfy'd with this for an Answer, but a
great Crowd of them came down in the Morning by break of Day to
our Camp; but seeing us in such an unaccountable Situation, they
durst come no farther than the Brook in our Front, where they
stood and showed us such a Number, that indeed terrify'd us very
much; for those that spoke least of them, spoke of ten thousand:
here they stood and looked at us a while, and then setting up a great
Howl, they let fly a Crowd of Arrows among us; but we were wel
enough fortify'd for that; for we shelter'd under our Baggage, and I
do not remember that one Man of us was hurt
Some Time after this, we see them move a little to our Right, and
expected them on the Rear, when a cunning Fellow, a Cossack, as
they call them, of Jarawena, in the Pay of the Muscovites, calling to
the Leader of the Caravan, said to him, I'll go send all these People
away to Siheilka; this was a City, four or five Days' Journey at least
to the South, and rather behind us: so he takes his Bow and Arrows,
and getting on Horse-back, he rides away from our Rear directly, as
it were back to Nortszinskoy; after this, he takes a great Circu't
about, and comes to the Army of the Tartars, as if he had been sent
Express to tell them a long Story; that the People who had burnt
the Cham-Chi-TJiaungu, were gone to Siheilka, with a Caravan of
Miscreants, as he called them, that is to say, Christians; and that they
had resolv'd to burn the God Schal-Isar, belonging to the Tongueses.
As this Fellow was himself a mere Tartar, and perfectly spoke
their Language, he counterfeited so well, that they all took it from
him, and away they drove in a most violent Hurry to Siheilka, which
it seems was five Days' Journey to the North, and in less than three
Hours, they were entirely out of our Sight, and we never heard any
more of them; and we never knew whether they went to that other
Place called Siheilka, or no.
So we passed safely on to the City of Jarawena, where there was
a Garrison of Muscovites, and there we rested five Days, the Caravan
being exceedingly fatigu'd with the last Day's hard march, and with
want of Rest in the Night
From this City we had a frightful Desert, which held us three and
twenty Days' March: We farnish'd ourselves with some Tents here,
for the better accommodating ourselves in the Night; and the Leader
of the Caravan procured sixteen Carriages or Waggons of the Country,
for carrying our Water and Provisions, and these Carriages were our
Defence every Night round our little Camp; so that had the Tartars
ippear'd, unless they had been very numerous indeed, they would not
have been able to hurt us.
We may well be suppos'd to want Rest again after this long
Journey; for in this Desert we saw neither House or Tree, or scarce
a Bush; we saw abundance of the Sable-Hunters, as they call'd them:
These are all Tartars of the Mongol Tartary, of which this Country is
i part, and they frequently attack small Caravans, but we saw no
Numbers of them together: I was curious to see the Sable Skins they
catched, but could never speak with any of them, for they durst not
come near us, neither durst we straggle from our Company, to go
near them.
After we had passed this Desert we came into a Country pretty
well inhabited; that is to say, we found Towns and Castles, settled
by the Czar of Muscovy, with Garrisons of Stationary Soldiers to pro-
tect the Caravans, and defend the Country against the Tartars, who
would otherwise make it very dangerous travelling; and his Czarish
Majesty has given such strict Orders for the well guarding the Cara
vans and Merchants, that if there are any Tartars heard of in the
Country, Detachments of the Garrisons are always sent to see the
Travellers safe from Station to Station.
And thus the Governor of Adinskoy, who I had Opportunity to
make a Visit to, by means of the Scots Merchant who was acquainted
with him, offer'd us a Guard of 50 Men, if we thought there was any
Danger, to the next Station.
I thought long before this, that as we came nearer to Europe we
should find the Country better peopled, and the People more civi-
liz'd, but I found myself mistaken in both, for we had yet the Nation
of the Tongueses to pass through; where we saw the same Tokens of
Paganism and Barbarity, or worse, than before, only as they were
conquer'd by the Muscovites, and entirely reduc'd, they were not so
dangerous; but for Rudeness of Manners, Idolatry, and Multitheism
no People in the World ever went beyond them: They are clothed
all in Skins of Beasts, and their Houses are built of the same: You
know not a Man from a Woman, neither by the Ruggedness of their
Countenances or their Clothes; and in the Winter, when the Ground
is cover'd with Snow, they live under Ground in Houses like Vaults,
which have Cavities going from one to another.
If the Tartars had their Cham-Chi-Thaungu for a whole Village or
Country, these had Idols in every Hut and in every Cave; besides,
they worship the Stars, the Sun, the Water, the Snow, and in a word,
everything that they do not understand, and they understand but very
little; so that almost every Element, every uncommon thing, sets
them a sacrificing.
But I am no more to describe People than Countries, any farther
than my own Story comes to be concern'd in them: I met with
nothing peculiar to myself in all this Country, which I reckon was from
the Desert which I spoke of last, at least 400 Miles, half of it being
another Desert, which took us up 12 Days' severe travelling, without
House, or Tree, or Bush, but were oblig'd again to carry our own
Provisions, as well Water as Bread. After we were out of this Desert,
and had travell'd two Days, we came to Janezay, a Muscovite City or
Station, on the great River Janezay: this River they told us parted
Europe from Asia, though our Map-makers, as I am told, do not
agree to it; however, it is certainly the Eastern Boundary of th«
ancient Siberia, which now makes up a Province only of the vast
Muscovite Empire, but is itself equal in Bigness to the whole Empir«
of Germany.
And yet here I observ'd Ignorance and Paganism still prevail'd,
except in the Muscovite Gairisons; all the Country between the River
Oby and the River Janezay is as entirely Pagan, and the People as
barbarous, as the remotest of the Tartars, nay, as any Nation, for
aught I know in Asia or America: I also found, which I observ'd
to the Muscovite Governors whom I had Opportunity to converse
with, that the poor Pagans are not much the wiser or the nearer
Christianity for being under the Muscovite Government; which they
acknowledg'd was true enough, but, as they said, was none of their
Business: That if the Czar expected to convert his Siberian, or
Tonguese, or Tartar Subjects, it should be done by sending Clergy-
men among them, not Soldiers; and they added, with more Sincerity
than I expected, that they found it was not so much the Concern of
their Monarch to make the People Christians, as it was to make them
Subjects.
From this River to the great River Oby, we crossed a wild
uncultivated Country: I cannot say it is a barren Soil; it is only
barren of People, and good Management, otherwise it is in itself a
most pleasant, fruitful and agreeable Country: What Inhabitants we
found in it are all Pagans, except such as are sent among them from
Russia; for this is the Country, I mean on both sides the River Oby,
whither the Muscovite Criminals, that are not put to Death, ara
banish'd, and from whence it is next to impossible they should ever
come away.
I have nothing material to say of my particular Affairs, till I came
to Tobolski, the Capital City of Siberia, where I continu'd some time
on the following Occasion.
We had been now almost seven Months on our Journey, and
Winter began to come on apace; whereupon my Partner and I called
a Council about our particular Affairs, in which we found it proper,
considering that we were bound for England, and not for Moscow, to
consider how to dispose of ourselves: They told us of Sledges and
Rein Deer to carry us over the Snow in the Winter time; and indeed
they have such things, that it would be incredible to relate the
Particulars of, by which means the Russions travel more in the
Winter than they can in Summer, because in these Sledges they
are able to run Night and Day; the Snow being frozen, is
one universal Covering to Nature, by which the Hills, the Vales,
the Rivers, the Lakes, all are smooth, and hard as a Stone, and
they run upon the Surface, without any regard to what is under
neath.
But I had no occasion to push at a Winter Journey of this kind:
I was bound to England, not to Moscow, and my Route lay two ways,
either I must go on as the Caravan went till I came to Jeroslaw, and
then go off West for Narva, and the Gulf of Finland; and so either
by Sea or Land to Dantzic, where I might possibly sell my China
Cargo to good Advantage, or I must leave the Caravan at a littie
Town on the Dwina, from whence I had but six Days by Water to
Archangel, and from thence might be sure of Shipping, either to
England, Holland, or Hamburgh.
Now to go any of these Journeys in the Winter, would have been
preposterous; for as to Dantzic, the Baltic would be frozen up, and
I could not get Passage, and to go by Land in those Countries, was
far less safe than among the Mongol Tartars; likewise to go to Arch-
angel in October, all the Ships would be gone from thence, and even
the Merchants who dwell there in Summer, retire South to Moscow in
the Winter when the Ships are gone; so that I should have nothing
but Extremity of Cold to encounter, with a Scarcity of Provisions,
and must lie there in an empty Town all the Winter: so that upon
the whole I thought it much my better way to let the Caravan go, and
to make Provision to winter where I was, (viz.) at Tobolski in Siberia,
in the Latitude of 60 Degrees, where I was sure of three Things to
wear out a cold Winter with, (viz.) Plenty of Provision such as the
Country afforded; a warm House, with Fuel enough, and excellent
Company; of all which I shall give a full Account in its Place.
I was now in a quite different Climate from my belov'd Island,
where I never felt Cold except when I had my Ague; on the con-
trary, I had much to do to bear any Clothes on my Back, and never
made any Fire but without Doors, and for my necessity in dressing
my Food, Grc. Now I made me three good Vests, with large Robes
or Gowns over them to hang down to the Feet, and button close to
the Wrists, and all these lined with Furs to make them sufficiently
warm.
As to a warm House, I must confess I greatly dislik'd our way in
England of making Fires in every Room in the House, in open
Chimneys, which when the Fire was out, always kept the Air in the
Room cold as the Climate: But taking an Apartment in a good
House in the Town, I order'd a Chimney to be built like a Furnace,
in the centre of six several Rooms, like a Stove, the Funnel to carry
the Smoke went up one Way, the Door to come at the Fire went in
another, and all the Rooms were kept equally warm, but no Fire
seen; just as they heat the Bagnios in England.
By this means we had always the same Climate in all the Rooms,
and an equal Heat was preserv'd; and how cold soever it was with-
out, it was always warm within, and yet we saw no Fire, nor were in-
commoded with any Smoke.
The most wonderful thing of all was, that it should be possible to
meet with good Company here, in a Country so barbarous as that of
the most Northerly Parts of Europe, near the frozen Ocean, and within
but a very few Degrees of Nova Zembla.
But this being the Country where the State Criminals of Muscovy,
as I observ'd before, are all banish'd, this City was full of Noblemen,
Princes, Gentlemen, Colonels, and in short all Degrees of the
Nobility, Gentry, Soldiery, and Courtiers of Muscovy: Here was the
famous Prince Galliozen, the old General Robostiski, and several other
Persons of Note, and some Ladies.
By means of my Scots Merchant, whom nevertheless I parted with
here, I made an Acquaintance here with several of these Gentlemen,
and some of them of the first Rank, and from these in the long
Winter Nights in which I stay'd here, I receiv'd very agreeable Visits:
It was talking one Night with Prince one of the banish'd
Ministers of State, belonging to the Czar of Muscovy, that my Talk of
my particular Case began: He had been telling me abundance of
fine Things of the Greatness, the Magnificence, the Dominions, and
the absolute Power of the Emperor of the Russians. I interrupted
him, and told him I was a greater and more powerful Prince than ever
the Czar of Muscovy was, though my Dominions were not so large, or
my People so many. The Russian Grandee looked a little surpris'd,
and fixing his Eyes steadily upon me, began to wonder what I meant
/ told him, his Wonder would cease when I had explain'd myself:
First, I told him, I had the absolute Disposal of the Lives and Fortunes
of all my Subjects: That notwithstanding my absolute Power, I had
not one Person disaffected to my Government, or to my Person, in all
my Dominions. He shook his Head at that, and said, there indeed
I outdid the Czar of Muscovy. I told him, That all the Lands in my
Kingdom were my own, and all my Subjects were not only my
Tenants, but Tenants at Will: That they would all fight for me to
the last Drop; and that never Tyrant, for such I acknowledged myself
to be, was ever so universally belov'd, and yet so horribly feared by
his Subjects.
After amusing them with these Riddles in Government for a while,
I opened the Case, and told them the Story at large of my living in.
the Island, and how I manag'd both myself and the People there
that were under me, just as I have since minuted it down. They were
exceedingly taken with the Story, and especially the Prince, who told
me with a Sigh, that the true Greatness of Life was to be Master of
ourselves: That he would not have exchang'd such a State of Life
as mine, to have been Czar of Muscovy; and that he found more
Felicity in the Retirement he seemed to be banish'd to there, than ever
he found in the highest Authority he enjoy'd in the Court of his
Master the Czar: That the Height of human Wisdom was to bring
. our Tempers down to our Circumstances; and to make a Calm with-
in, under the Weight of the greatest Scorns without When he came
first hither, he said he used to tear the Hair from his Head, and the
Clothes from his Back, as others had done before him; but a little
Time and Consideration had made him look into himself, as well as
round him to things without: That he found the Mind of Man, if
it was but once brought to reflect upon the State of universal Life,
and how little this World was concern'd in its true Felicity, was per-
fectly capable of making a Felicity for itself, fully satisfying to itself,
and suitable to its own best Ends and Desires, with but very little
Assistance from the World: That Air to breathe in, Food to sustain
Life, Clothes for Warmth, and Liberty for Exercise in Order to
Health, completed, in his Opinion, all that the World could do for
us; and though the Greatness, the Authority, the Riches, and the
Pleasures which some enjoy'd in the World, and which he had enjoy'd
his Share of, had much in them that was agreeable to us; yet he
observ'd that all those things chiefly gratify'd the coarsest of our
Affections, such as our Ambition, our particular Pride, our Avarice,
our Vanity, and our Sensuality; all which were indeed the mere Pro-
duct of the worst part of Man, were in themselves Crimes, and had in
them the Seeds of all Manner of Crimes, but neither were related to,
or concern'd with any of those Virtues that constituted us wise Men,
or of those Graces which distinguish'd us as Christians: That being
now depriv'd of all the fancied Felicity which he enjoy'd in the full
Exercise of all those Vices, he said he was at Leisure to look upon
the dark Side of them, where he found all manner of Deformity, and
was now convinc'd, that Virtue only makes a Man truly wise, rich,
and great, and preserves him in the way to a superior Happiness in a
future State. And in this he said, they were more happy in their
Banishment, than all their Enemies were, who had the full Possession
of all the Wealth and Power that they (the Banish'd) had left behind
them.
Nor, Sir, says he, do I bring my Mind to this politically, by the
Necessity of my Circumstances, which some call miserable; but if I
know anything of myself, I would not now go back, though the Czar,
my Master, should call me, and re-instate me in all my former
Grandeur; I say, I would no more go back to it, than I believe my
Soul, when it shall be deliver'd from this Prison of the Body, and has
had a Taste of the glorious State beyond Life, would come back to
the Jail of Flesh and Blood it is now enclos'd in, and leave Heaven
to deal in the Dirt and Crime of human Affairs.
He spoke this with so much Warmth in his Temper, so much
Earnestness and Motion of his Spirits, which were apparent in his
Countenance, that it was evident it was the true Sense of his Soul:
There was no room to doubt his Sincerity.
I told him, I once thought myself a kind of a Monarch in my old
Station, of which I had given him an Account, but that I thought he
was not a Monarch only, but a great Conqueror; for that he that has
got a Victory over his own exorbitant Desires, and has the absolute
Dominion over himself, whose Reason entirely governs his Will, is
certainly greater than he that conquers a City. But, my Lord, said I,
shall I take the Liberty to ask you a Question? With all my Heart,
says he. If the Door of your Liberty was opened, said I, would you
not take hold of it to deliver yourself from this Exile?
Hold, said he, your Question is subtle, and requires some serious
just Distinctions, to give it a sincere Answer; and I'll give it you
from the Bottom of my Heart Nothing that I know of in this
World would move me to deliver myself from this State of Banish-
ment, except these two, First, the Enjoyment of my Relations, and
Secondly, a little warmer Climate; but I protest to you, that to go
back to the Pomp of the Court, the Glory, the Power, the Hurry of a
Minister of State, the Wealth, the Gaiety, and the Pleasures, that is to
say, Follies of a Courtier; if my Master should send me Word this
Moment, that he restores me to all he banish'd me from; I protest
r/Tknow myself at all, I would not leave this Wilderness, these
Deserts, and these frozen Lakes, for the Palace at Moscow.
But, my Lord, said I, perhaps you not only are banish'd from the
Pleasures of the Court, and from the Power, and Authority, and
tVealth you enjoy'd before, but you may be absent too from some of
the Conveniences of Life, your Estate perhaps confiscated and your
Effects plunder'd, and the Supplies left you here may not be suitable
to the ordinary Demands of Life.
Ay, says he, that is as you suppose me to be a Lord, or a Prince,
6v. So indeed I am; but you are now to consider me only as a
Man, a human Creature, not at all distinguish'd from another, and so
I can suffer no Want, unless I should be visited with Sickness and
Distempers. However, to put the Question out of Dispute; you see
our Manner; we are in this Place five Persons of Rank ; we live per-
fectly retir'd, as suited to a State of Banishment; we have some-
thing rescu'd from the Shipwreck of our Fortunes, which keeps us
from the mere Necessity of hunting for our Food; but the poor
Soldiers who are here, without that Help, live in as much Plenty as
we, who go into the Woods and catch Sables and Foxes ; the Labour
of a Month will maintain them a Year; and as the Way of living is
not expensive, so it is not hard to get sufficient to ourselves. So that
Objection is out of Doors.
I have not room to give a full Account of the most agreeable Con-
versation I had with this truly great Man; in all which he showed,
that his Mind was so inspir'd with a superior Knowledge of Things,
so supported by Religion, as well as by a vast Share of Wisdom;
that his Contempt of the World, was really as much as he had ex-
press'd, and that he was always the same to the last, as will appear in
the Story I am going to tell.
I had been here 8 Months, and a dark dreadful Winter I thought
it to be, the Cold so intense, that I could not so much as look abroad
without being wrapt in Furs, and a Mask of Fur before my Face, or
rather a Hood with only a Hole for Breath, and two for Sight: The
little Daylight we had, was, as we reckon'd, for three Months, not
above five Hours a Day, and six at most; only that the Snow lying
on the Ground continually, and the Weather clear, it was never quite
dark: Our Horses were kept (or rather starved) under Ground, and
as for our Servants, for we hired three Servants here to look after
our Horses and selves, we had every now and then their Fingers
wd Toes to thaw and take care of, lest they should mortify and
tall off.
It is true, within Doors we were warm, the Houses being close, the
Walls thick, the Lights small, and the Glass all double; our Food
was chiefly the flesh of Deer dried and cured in the Season; good
Bread enough, but baked as Biscuits; dried Fish of several Sorts, and
some Flesh of Mutton, and of the Buffaloes, which is pretty good
Beef: All the Stores of Provisions for the Winter are laid up in the
Summer, and well cured; our Drink was Water mixed with Aqua-
vits instead of Brandy, and for a Treat, Mead instead of Wine,
which, however, they have excellent good: The Hunters, who venture
abroad all Weathers, frequently brought us in fresh Venison, very fat
and good, and sometimes Bear's Flesh, but we did not much care for
the last: We had a good Stock of Tea, with which we treated our
Friends, as above; and in a word, we lived very cheerfully and well,
all things consider'd.
It was now March, and the Days grown considerably longer, and
the Weather, at least, tolerable; so the other Travellers began to pre-
pare Sleds to carry them over the Snow, and to get things ready tc
be going; but my Measures being fixed, as I have said, for Arch-
angel, and not for Muscovy or the Baltic, I made no Motion; know-
ing very well that the Ships from the South do not set out for that
Part of the World till May ox June, and that if I was there by the
beginning of August, it would be as soon as any Ships would be ready
to go away; and therefore, I say, I made no haste to be gone, as others
did; in a Word, I saw a great many People, nay, all the Travellers go
away before me: It seems every Year they go from thence to Moscow
for Trade, (viz.) to carry Furs, and buy Necessaries with them, which
they bring back to furnish their Shops; also others went of the same
Errand to Archangel, but then they also being to come back again
above 800 Miles, went all out before me.
In short, about the latter end of May I began to make all ready to
pack up; and as I was doing this, it occurr'd to me, that seeing all
these People were banish'd by the Czar of Muscmy to Siberia, and yet
when they came there, were left at Liberty to go whither they would;
why did they not then go away to any Part of the World whereve!
they thought fit, and I began to examine what should hinder them
from making such an Attempt
But my Wonder was over, when I enter'd upon that Subject with
the Person I have mention'd, who answer'd me thus: Consider, First,
Sir, said he, the Place where we are; and Secondly, the Condition we
are in; especially, said he, the Generality of the People who are
banish'd hither; we are surrounded, said he, with stronger Things
than Bars and Bolts; on the North Side an unnavigable Ocean, where
Ship never sailed, and Boat never swam; neither, if we had both,
could we know where to go with them: Every other Way, said he,
we have above a Thousand Miles to pass through the Czar's own
Dominions, and Byways utterly unpassable, except by the Roads
made by the Governor, and by the Towns garrison'd by his Troops;
so that we could neither pass undiscover'd by the Road, or subsist
any other Way, so that it is in vain to attempt it
I was silenc'd indeed at once, and found that they were in a Prison,
every Jot as secure as if they had been locked up in the Castle at
Moscow; however, it came into my Thought, that I might certainly
be made an Instrument to procure the Escape of this excellent Person^
and that whatever Hazard I run, I would certainly try if I could
carry him off. Upon this I took an Occasion one Evening to tell him
my Thoughts: I represented to him, that it was very easy for me to
carry him away, there being no Guard over him in the Country, and
as I was not going to Moscow, but to Archangel, and that I went in
the nature of a Caravan, by which I was not oblig'd to lie in the
Stationary Towns in the Desert, but could encamp every Night where
I would, we might easily pass uninterrupted to Archangel, where I
would immediately secure him on Board an English or Dutch Ship,
and cany him off safe along with me; and as to his Subsistence, and
other Particulars, it should be my Care till he could better supply
himself.
He heard me very attentively, and looked earnestly on me all the
while I spoke; nay, I could see in his very Face, that what I said put
his Spirits into an exceeding Ferment; his Colour frequently changed,
his Eyes looked red, and his Heart flutter'd, that it might be even
perceiv'd in his Countenance; nor could he immediately answer me.
When I had done, and as it were expected what he would say to it,
after he had paused a little he embrac'd me, and said, How unhappy
are we, unguarded Creatures as we are, that even our greatest Acts of
Friendship are made Snares to us, and we are made Tempters of
one another! My dear Friend, said he, your Offer is so sincere, lias
such Kindness in it, is so disinterested in itself, and is so calculated
for my Advantage, that I must have very little Knowledge of the
World, if I did not both wonder at it, and acknowledge the Obligation
I have upon me to you for it But did you believe I was sincere in
what I have so often said to you of my Contempt of the World? Did
you believe I spoke my very Soul to you, and that I had really obtain'd
that Degree of Felicity here, that had placed me above all that the
World could give me, or do for me? Did you believe I was sin-
cere, when I told you I would not go back if I was recall'd, even to be
all that once I was in the Court with the Favour of the Czar my
Master? Did you believe me, my Friend, to be an honest Man, or did
you think me to be a boasting Hypocrite? Here he stopped, as if he
would hear what I would say, but indeed, I soon after perceiv'd that
he stopped because his Spirits were in Motion, his great Heart was
full of Struggles, and he could not go on. I was, I confess, astonish'd
at the thing as well as at the Man, and I used some Arguments with
him to urge him to set himself free: That he ought to look upon this
as a Door open'd by Heaven for his Deliverance, and a Summons by
Providence, who has the Care and Disposition of all Events, to do
himself good, and to render himself useful in the World.
He had by this Time recover'd himself: How do you know, Sir,
says he warmly, that instead of a Summons from Heaven, it may not
be a Feint of another Instrument? Representing in all the alluring
Colours to me the Show of Felicity as a Deliverance, which may in
itself be my Snare, and tend directly to my Ruin: Here I am free
from the Temptation of returning to my former miserable Greatness;
there I am not sure but that all the Seeds of Pride, Ambition,
Avarice and Luxury, which I know remain in Nature, may revive and
take Root, and in a Word, again overwhelm me, and then the happy
Prisoner, who you see now Master of his Soul's Liberty, shall be
the miserable Slave of his own Senses, in the Full of all personal
Liberty: Dear Sir, let me remain in this blessed Confinement,
banish'd from the Crimes of Life, rather than purchase a Show of
Freedom, at the Expense of the Liberty of my Reason, and at the
Expense of the future Happiness which now I have in my View, but
Bhall then, I fear, quickly lose Sight of; for I am but Flesh, a Man,
a mere Man, have Passions and Affections as likely to possess and
overthrow me as any Man: O be not my Friend and my Tempter
both together!
If I was surpris'd before. I was ouitc dumb now, and stood silent,
looking at him, and indeed admir'd at what I saw; the Struggle in
his Soul was so great, that though the Weather was extremely cold, it
put him into a most violent Sweat, and I found he wanted to give
Vent to his Mind; so I said a Word or two, that I would leave him
to consider of it, and wait on him again, and then I withdrew to my
own Apartment
About two Hours after I heard somebody at, or near, the Door of
my Room, and I was going to open the Door, but he had open'd it,
and came in: My dear Friend, says he, you had almost overset me,
but I am recover'd; do not take it ill that I do not close with your
Offer; I assure you, it is not for want of a Sense of the Kindness of
it in you, and I came to make the most sincere Acknowledgment of
it to you; but I hope I have got the Victory over myself.
My Lord, said I, I hope you are fully satisfy'd that you do not
resist the Call of Heaven. Sir, said he, if it had been from Heaven,
the same Power would have influenc'd me to accept it; but I hope,
and am fully satisfy'd, that it is from Heaven that I decline it, and I
have an infinite Satisfaction in the Parting, that you shall leave me an
honest Man still, though not a free Man.
I had nothing to do but to acquiesce, and make Professions to him
of my having no End in it but a sincere Desire to serve him: He
embrac'd me very passionately, and assur'd me, he was sensible of
that, and should always acknowledge it, and with that he offer'd me
a very fine Present of Sables, too much indeed for me to accept from
a Man in his Circumstances, and I would have avoided them, but he
would not be refus'd.
The next Morning I sent my Servant to his Lordship, with a small
Present of Tea, and two Pieces of China Damask, and four little
Wedges of Japan Gold, which did not all weigh above six Ounces, or
thereabout, but were far short of the Value of his Sables, which,
indeed, when I came to England, I found worth near 200/. He ac
cepted the Tea, and one Piece of the Damask, and one of the Pieces
of Gold, which had a fine Stamp upor.it, of the Japan Comage, which
I found he took for the Rarity of it, but would not take any more,
and he sent Word by my Servant that he desir'd to speak with me.
When I came to him, he told me, I knew what had passed between
us, and hoped I would not move him any more in that Affair; but
that since I had made such a generous Offer to him, he asked me, if
I had Kindness enough to offer the same to another Person that he
would name to me, in whom he had a great Share of Concern; 1
told him, that I could not say I inclin'd to do so much for any one
but himself, for whom I had a particular Value, and should kave been
glad to have been the Instrument of his Deliverance; however, if he
would please to name the Person to me, I would give him my Answer,
and hoped he would not be displeas'd with me, if he was with my
Answer; he told me, it was only his Son, who, though I had not
seen, yet was in the same Condition with himself, and above two
hundred Miles from him, on the other side the Oby; but that if I
consented, he would send for him.
I made no Hesitation, but told him I would do it: I made some
Ceremony in letting him understand that it was wholly on his
Account, and that seeing I could not prevail on him, I would show
my Respect to him, by my Concern for his Son; but these Things
are too tedious to repeat here: He sent away the next Day for his
Son, and in about twenty Days he came back with the Messenger,
bringing six or seven Horses, loaded with very rich Furs, and which
in the whole amounted to a very great Value.
His Servants brought the Horses into the Town, but left the young
Lord at a Distance, till Night, when he came incognito into our
Apartment, and his Father presented him to me; and in short, we
concerted there the Manner of our travelling, and everything proper
for the Journey.
I had bought a considerable Quantity of Sables, black Fox Skins,
fine Ermines, and such other Furs as are very rich; I say, I had
bought them in that City in Exchange for some of the Goods I
brought from China; in particular for the Cloves and Nutmegs, of
which I sold the greatest Part here, and the rest afterwards at Arch-
angel, for a much better Price than I could have done at London;
and my Partner who was sensible of the Profit, and whose Business
more particularly than mine was Merchandise, was mightily pleased
with our Stay, on Account of the Traffic we made here.
It was the beginning oljune when I left this remote Place, a City,
I believe, little heard of in the World; and indeed it is so far out of
the Road of Commerce, that I know not how it should be much
talked of. We were now come to a very small Caravan, being only
Siirty-two Horses and Camels in all, and all of them passed foi mine,
though my new Guest was Proprietor of eleven of them; it was most
natural also that I should take more Servants with me than I had
before, and the young Lord passed for my Steward; what great Man
I passed for myself, I know not, neither did it concern me to inquire;
we had here the worst and the largest Desert to pass over that we
met with in all the Journey; indeed I call it the worst, because the
Way was very deep in some Places, and very uneven in others; the
best we had to say for it was, that we thought we had no Troops
of Tartars and Robbers to fear, and that they never came on
this Side the River Oby, or at least but very seldom, but we found it
otherwise.
My young Lord had with him a faithful Muscovite Sen-ant, or
rather a Siberian Servant, who was perfectly acquainted with the
Country, and led us by private Roads, that we avoided coming in to
the principal Towns and Cities upon the great Road, such as Tumen,
Soly-Kamskoi, and several others; because the Muscovite Garrisons
which are kept there, are very curious and strict in their Observation
upon Travellers; and searching lest any of the banish'd Persons of
Note should make their escape that Way into Muscovy; but by this
Means, as we were kept out of the Cities, so our whole Journey was
a Desert, and we were oblig'd to encamp and lie in our Tents, when
we might have had very good Accommodation in the Cities on the
Way: This the young Lord was so sensible of, that he would not
allow us to lie abroad, when we came to several Cities on the Way,
but lay abroad himself with his Servant in the Woods, and met us
always at the appointed Places.
We were just enter'd Europe, having pass'd the River Kama, which
in these Parts is the Boundary between Europe and Asia, and the
first City on the European Side was called Soly-Kamskoi, which is as
much as to say, the great City on the River Kama; and here we
thought to have seen some evident Alteration in the People, their
Manner, their Habit, their Religion, and their Business; but we were
mistaken, for as we had a vast Desert to pass, which by Relation is
near seven hundred Miles long in some Places, but not above two
hundred Miles over where we passed it; so till we came past that
horrible Place, we found very little Difference between that Country
and the Mongol Tartary; the People mostly Pagans, and little better
than the Savages of America, their Houses and Towns full of Idols,
and their Way of Living wholly barbarous, except in the Cities as
above, and the Villages near them; where there are Christians, as they
call themselves, of the Greek Church, but have their Religion mingled
with so many Relics of Superstition, that it is scarce to be known
in some Places from mere Sorcery and Witchcraft
In passing this Forest, I thought indeed we must, after all oui
Dangers were in our Imagination escap'd, as before, have been
plunder'd and robbed, and perhaps murder'd by a Troop of Thieves;
of what Country they were, whether the roving Bands of the Ostiachi,
a Kind of Tartars or wild People on the Bank of the Oby, had ranged
thus far, or whether they were the Sable-Hunters of Siberia, I am yet
at a Loss to know; but they were all on Horseback, carry'd Bows
and Arrows, and were at first about five and forty in Number; they
came so near to us, as within about two Musket Shot, and asking no
Questions, they surrounded us with their Horse, and looked very
earnestly upon us twice; at length they placed themselves just in
our Way, upon which we drew up in a little Line before our Camels,
being not above sixteen Men in all; and being drawn up thus, we
halted and sent out the Siberian Servant, who attended his Lord, to
see who they were; his Master was the more willing to let him go,
because he was not a little apprehensive that they were a Siberian
Troop sent out after him: The Man came up near them with a Flag
of Truce, and called them, but though he spoke several of their
Languages, or Dialects of Languages rather, he could not understand
a Word they said; however, after some Signs to him not to come
nearer to them at his Peril; so he said he understood them to mean,
offering to shoot at him if he advanc'd; the Fellow came back no
siser than he went, only that by their Dress, he said, he believ'd them
to be some Tartars of Kalmuck, or of Circassian Hordes; and that
there must be more of them upon the great Desert, though he never
heard that any of them ever were seen so far North before.
This was small Comfort to us; however, we had no Remedy;
there was on our left Hand at about a Quarter of a Mile's Distance,
a little Grove or Clump of Trees which stood close together, and very
near the Road; I immediately resolv'd we would advance to those
Trees, and fortify ourselves as well as we could there; for first I con-
sider'd that the Trees would in a great Measure cover us from their
Arrows, and in the next Place, they could not come to charge us in
a Body; it was indeed my old Portuguese Pilot who propos'd it, and
who had this Excellency attending him, namely, that he was always
readiest and most apt to direct and encourage us in Cases of the most
Danger; we advanc'd immediately with what Speed we could, and
gained that little Wood, the Tartars or Thieves, for we knew not what
to call them, keeping their Stand and not attempting to hinder us;
when we came thither, we found to our great Satisfaction that it was
a swampy springy Piece of Ground, and on the one Side a very great
Spring of Water, which running out in a little Rill or Brook, was a
little farther joined by another of the like Bigness, and was in short
the Head or Source of a considerable River, called afterwards the
Wirtska; the Trees which grew about this Spring were not all
above two hundred, but were very large, and stood pretty thick; so
that as soon as we got in we saw ourselves perfectly safe from the
Enemy, unless they alighted and attack'd us on Foot
But to make this more difficult, our Portuguese, with indefatigable
Application, cut down great Arms of the Trees, and laid them hanging
tut quite cut off from one Tree to another, so that he made a continued
Fence almost round us.
We stayed here waiting the Motion of the Enemy some Hours
without perceiving they made any Motion; when about two Hours
before Night they came down directly upon us, and though we had
not perceiv'd it, we found they had been joined by some more of the
same, so that they were near fourscore Horse, whereof, however, we
fancied some were Women: They came on till they were within half
Shot of our little Wood, when we fired one Musket without Ball, and
called to them in the Russian Tongue, to know what they wanted, and
bid them keep off; but as if they knew nothing of what we said, they
came on with a double Fury directly up to the Wood side, not imagin-
ing we were so barricaded that they could not break in: our old
Pilot was our Captain, as well as he had been our Engineer, and de-
sir'd of us not to fire upon them till they came within Pistol-Shot, and
that we might be sure to kill, and that when we did fire, we should be
sure to take good Aim; we bade him give the Word of Command,
which he delay'd so long, that they were some of them within two
Pikes' Length of us when we fired.
We aimed so true, (or Providence directed our Shot so sure,) that
we killed fourteen of them and wounded several others, as also several
of their Horses; for we had all of us loaded our Pieces with two or
three Bullets at least
They were terribly surpris'd with our Fire, and retreated immediately
about one Hundred Rods from us; in which Time we loaded oui
Pieces again, and seeing them keep that Distance, we sallied out and
catched four or five of their Horses, whose Riders we supposed were
killed, and coming up to the dead, we could easily perceive they were
Tartars, but knew not from what Country, or how they came to make
an Excursion such an unusual Length.
About an Hour after they made a Motion to attack us again, and
rode round our little Wood, to see where else they might break in;
but finding us always ready to Face them, they went off again, and we
resolv'd not to stir from the Place for that Night
We slept little, you may be sure, but spent the most Part of the
Nighf in strengthening our Situation, and barricading the Entrances
into the Wood, and keeping a strict Watch. We waited for Day-
light, and when it came it gave us a very unwelcome Discovery in-
deed; for the Enemy, whom we thought were discourag'd with the
Reception they had met with, were now increas'd to no less than
three hundred, and had set up eleven or twelve Huts and Tents, as
if they were resolv'd to besiege us; and this little Camp they had
pitched upon the open Plain, at about three Quarters of a Mile from
us. We were indeed surpris'd at this Discovery; and now I confess
I gave myself over for lost, and all that I had: The Loss of my
Effects did not lie so near me, (though they were very considerable^) as
the Thoughts of falling into the Hands of such Barbarians, at the
latter End of my Journey, after so many Difficulties and Hazards as I
had gone through, and even in Sight of our Port, where we expected
Safety and Deliverance; as for my Partner, he was raging; he de-
clar'd that to lose his Goods would be his Ruin, and he would rather
die than be starved; and he was for fighting to the last Drop.
The young Lord, as gallant as ever Flesh showed itself, was for
fighting to the last also; and my old Pilot was of the Opinion we were
able to resist them all in the Situation we were then in; and thus we
spent the Day in Debates of what we should do, but towards Even-
ing we found that the Number of our Enemies still increas'd; perhaps
is they were abroad in several Parties for Prey, the first had sent
out Scouts to call for Help, and to acquaint them of the Booty, and
we did not know but by the Morning they might still be a greater
Number; so I began to inquire of those People we had brought
from Tobolski if there was no other or more private Ways by which
we might avoid them in the Night, and perhaps either retreat to some
Town, or get Help to guard us over the Desert
The Siberian who was Servant to the young Lord, told u* if we
design'd to avoid them and not fight, he would engage to carry us ofl
in the Night, to a Way that went North towards the Petrou, by which
he made no Question but we might get away, and the Tartars never
the wiser; but he said his Lord had told him he would not retreat,
but would rather choose to fight I told him he mistook his Lord,
for that he was too wise a Man to love Fighting for the sake of it;
that I knew his Lord was brave enough by what he had showed
already; but that his Lord knew better than to desire to have seven-
teen or eighteen Men fight five hundred, unless an unavoidable Neces-
sity forced them to it; and that if he thought it possible for us to
escape in the Night, we had nothing else to do but to attempt it He
answer'd, if his Lord gave him such Orders he would lose his Life if
he did not perform it; we soon brought his Lord to give that Order,
though privately, and we immediately prepar'd for the putting it i"
Practice.
And first, as soon as it began to be dark, we kindled a Fire in ou»
little Camp, which we kept burning and prepar'd so as to make it
burn all Night, that the Tartars might conclude we were still there;
but as soon as it was dark, (that is to say) so as we could see the Stars
(for our Guide would not stir before) having all our Horses and
Camels ready loaden, we followed our new Guide, who I soon found
steered himself by the Pole, or North Star, all the Country being
level for a long Way.
After we had travell'd two Hours very hard, it began to be lighter
still, not that it was quite dark all Night, but the Moon began to rise,
so that in short it was rather lighter than we wished it to be; but by
six o'clock the next Morning we were gotten near forty Miles,
though the Truth is we almost spoiled our Horses. Here we found
a Russian Village named Kcrmazinskoy, where we rested, and heard
nothing of the Calmuck Tartars that Day; about two Hours before
Night we set out again, and travell'd till eight the next Morning,
though not quite so quick as before, and about seven o'clock we
passed a little River called Kirtza, and came to a good large Town
inhabited by Russians, and very populous, called Ozomoys; there
we heard that several Troops or Hordes of Calmucks had been Abroad
upon the Desert, but that we were now completely out of Danger of
them, which was to our great Satisfaction, you may be sure. Here we
t^ere oblig'd to get some fresh Horses, and having need enough of
Aest, we stayed five Days; and my Partner and I agreed to give the
honest Siberian who brought us thither the Value of ten Pistoles foi
his conducting us.
In five Days more we came to Veuslima, upon the River JVilzogda,
and, running into the Dwina, wr w-y». there very happily near the
end of our Travels by Land, that Kiver being navigable in seven
Days' Passage to Archangel; from hence we came to Lawrenskoy
the 3rd of July, and providing ourselves with two Luggage Boats, and
a Barge for our own Convenience, we embark'd the 7 th, and arriv'd
all safe at Archangel the i8th, having been a Year and five Months
and three Days on the Journey, including our Stay of eight Months
and odd Days at Tobolski.
We were oblig'd to stay at this Place six Weeks for the Arrival of
the Ships, and must have tarried longer, had not a Hamburgher come
in above a Month sooner than any of the English Ships; when after
some Consideration, that the City of Hamburgh might happen to be
as good a Market for our Goods as London, we all took Freight with
him, and having put my Goods on board, it was most natural for me
to put my Steward on board to take care of them, by which means
my young Lord had a sufficient Opportunity to conceal himself, never
coming on Shore in all the time we stayed there; and this he did
that he might not be seen in the City, where some of the Moscow
Merchants would certainly have seen and discover'd him.
We sailed from Archangel the 20th of August the same Year, and
after no extraordinary bad Voyage, arriv'd in the Elbe the 13 th of
September. Here my Partner and I found a very good Sale for our
Goods, as well those of China as the Sables, &•*. of Siberia; and
dividing the Produce of our Effects, u'y Share amounted to
3475/. 17X. 3d. notwithstanding so many Losses we had sustain'd and
Charges we had been at; only remembering that I had included in
this about six hundred Pounds worth of Diamonds which I had pur-
chas'd at Bengal.
Here the young Lord took his leave of us, and went up the Elbe
in order to go to the Court of Vienna, where he resolv'd to seek Pro-
tection, and where he could correspond with those of his Father's
Friends who were left alive: He did not part without all the Testi-
monies he could give me of Gratitude for the Service I had done
him, and his Sense ot my Kindness to the Prince his Father.
To conclude, having stayed near four Months in Hamburgh,! came
from thence Qver Land to the Hague, where I embark'd ;n the
5»7
Packet, and arriv'd in London the ioth of January, 1^5, naving
been gone from England ten Years and nine Months.
And here, resolving to harass myself no more, I am preparing for *
longer Journey than all these, having lived 72 Years a Life of infinite
Variety, and learned sufficiently to know the Value of Retirement
nd the Blessing of ending our Days in Peace
