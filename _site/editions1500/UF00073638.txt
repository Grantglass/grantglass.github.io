CHAPTER I.

I WAS born in the town of York, in the spring of 1632.
I was the third son of a man of some wealth, and I had a
good home. I was not bred to a trade, for my friends
had a wish that I should learn the law as a means to help
me through life. But, as I grew up, I made up my mind
to go to sea; from a child, my head had been full of the
sea, for when I was but a small boy I would sit, for hours
at a time, on the banks of a small stream that was near
our house, and dream of ships and the sea. My friends
did all they could to keep me at home, but it was of no
use, for in the fall of 1651 I ran off, and soon found my
way down on board of a ship, bound for a large town on
the south-east coast of the land. When safe on board the
ship I felt quite proud and glad, but if I had known all I
had to pass through in the rest of my life I would have
gone back home, but as 'I did not, I went on my way, and
though I had a great deal of bad luck, God took care of
me through it all, and taught me in time what was for my

ood.

g We had scarce left the land, when the wind blew up
strong and kept up for a few days, and then a great storm
came on, and one night I heard One of the men cry out,p

"The ship I. sprung aleak." All hands were brought
on deck, and set to work at the pumps. We could hear
the ship creak,' and her beams crack from end to end, and
soon it gave way, and we found that we must do all we -
could to save our lives. ' '

We saw a ship a short way off, and gave them a sign,
to make them know 'that we were in need of aid. They .
came near to us, and sent out two small boats which we '
got in--to, and we were all soon on board the ship, and in a
short time we were safe back in the town we came from,
where we met friends who gave us food and clothes, as
well as means to help us reach our homes.

'You will say that now. I ought to have gone home, but
I had both clothes and means, and I was too proud to go
back. The man who had lost his ship said to me, "Young

man, you'ought not to o to sea; this, your first trip, should i '

be to you a sign that od will not help you if you (10."

Though I knew he was right, I was hurt at this, and
spoke back in a rude way, and would not heed him, but
thought I would try it once more. '

This time our ship was bound for some isles in the
south. We had been out six weeks, and were far on our
way, when we saw a queer ship full of men on our track,
and we could see they were not fiends. We thought We.
could keep clear of them, or, if there was need for it, fight
them off, so we put on allour sails, but in a few hours they
caught up to us. We found they were Turks. They came
on board of our ship, and though we fought them as well
as we could, they .had more men and guns than we, and
when they had cut allour sails, done all the harm to the
ship they could, put to death three of our men, and hurt

board of a skip bound for gem--Page 5. Imbinm>> We,11306121807>> Omsoo. '7 '

They took us to their land, and sent most of the men to
their King, but the chief of the Turks took me as his own
prize and made a slave of me.

This was a. great change for me, and my heart sank with

 

grief. I had time now to think of my home, and all that
the dear ones had told me, but it was too late now, I must
do the best I could. At first I had to work hard, but as I8 ' Robinson Crusoe.

was young and quick, the chief soon took me to his own
house to wait on him. From this time my whole mind
was bent on how I could get off and be free. I thought,
" if the chief will take me with him when he goes to sea,
I will find a way," but this he would not do, for when he
went to sea he left me home to work on his farm, and take
care of the house, and when" he was at home. I had to fish,
and watch his ship. '

When I had been with him two years he was not so
strict, but would take me with him' when he'went out to fish.

One day he sent me with a small boat to catch some
fish, and I brought home a fine lot, which made him so
glad that he said some guests were. to dine with him the
next day, and I must go out for the fish. He sent me out
in a small ship, with a man, a Moor, and- a boy whose
name was Xury. Now, I thought, this is my chance to
get off; I will .be free this time. I told the boy to get two
guns and some shot, and sent the Moor for some tools,
while I put some food and wine in the ship, and when we
had all our things on board we set sail. When we had
gone out for a mile, we sat down to fish, but as the Moor
was a man I felt I could not trust, I would not pull up my
lines, for I did not want him to see the fish, and I said to
him, " There are no fish here, we must go out to sea," and
when we had gone for a league, I put my arm round his
Waist and threw him far out in the sea.

He swam up to the ship, and said if I would take him
in, he would go with me, and stay all his life with me. I
told him I did not want him, and bade him swim back to
the shore. Xury. swore he would be true to me, and as I
thought I would be safe with him, and he might be of
great use to me, I let him go with me. -- 'JRY m]

We had a. fair wind, and in a few days we Were a great
way out of the Turks' reach. As I still had some fear, I
kept out of the way of land for some time, but we found
we must go on shore to get food and drink.

We came to a place where it was still, and we saw no
one, and I told Xury we would stay here for the night, but
as soon as it was dark, we heard such barks and growls,
that we thought we would not go on shore 'till morn, when
Xury said, that if wild men or beasts (.zmne, he would
" give them shoot gun." He could fall; quite well, as he
had been so much with the white slaves that the Turks had.

In the morn, Xury said that if I would take the boat
close up to the shore, and give him one of the jars we had
with us, he would go and see if there were springs near
by, and What he could find to eat. I said to him, " l-Vhy
should you go ; why not let me go 1-"

He said, in a way full of love, "If wild mans come,
they eat me, you go way."

" Well, Xury," said I, " we will 30th go, and if wild
mans come, we will kill them--they shall not eat us."

When we were most up to the land, a large beast came
down to the edge of the shore, and gave such aloud roar,
that Xury cried out with fear. I took up my gun and shot
at him, which sent him back with a cry of pain. I knew
I had hurt him, but he fled to the woods and we saw no
more of him.

CHAPTER IL

WE then brought the boat up on shore, but for fear
some harm might come to it. I thought I would stay nearRobinson 69114306. 1!

by and watch it, so Xury took the gun and the jar, and
went off to the south; he soon came back with thejari'1.1ll,
and 011 the end of his gun a hare that he had shot, and
told me with great joy that he had seen " no wild mans."

I then told Xury to cook our meal, and when it was
done, we sat down and ate the hare, with some wild fruit
he had found, and the bread we had left, and when we
were tlnouu'h, put off to sea once 11101e.

As 110.111 as I could uess,0 the Cape Veid isles vs me not
far off, and I made up my mind to keep close to the coast,
in hopes that I might fall in with some ship which would
take me in, and I should be with friends once more.

As we went up the coast, Xury, whose eyes were more
on the watch than mine, saw a huge beast that lay on his
side near the shore. .I told Xury, " You shall go on shore
and kill him."

"Me kill! he eat me up with one mouth," Xury said, in
g1 eat flight.

i thought he might do us some good and took up my gun
and shoth at him. It did not kill him, but h1oke his leg,
at which he set up such a loud 10:11, that Xury could do
nau ht for some time but stand and gaze.

,e said he must have some of him, and told me to give
him the ax, and he would cut off his head; he went on
shore but he found he could not take his head, so he came
back with one of his feet and a part of the lee. I saw it
was so large that I thought I would like his skin, as it
would be of great use to me.

Xury and I went to wo1k at him, it took us both the
whole day y, but at last we got the hide off of him, and I
let it hang for two days in the sun to dry I found it nice
and soft to lie on, and 1'. made me a good bed.
In one piace some black men came down to the edge of
the shore; one of them had a long lance and the restheld
clubs and sticks. "7e were in need of food and drink, and
I thought I would go up to them, but Xury thought from
signs they made, they would like to kill us, and cried out
in great fear, " No go! No go I" .

I had some of the beast we had shot which '1 did not
like to eat, so I threw it to them, and made signs that we
would like some food. When they saw that we did not
mean to hurt them, one of them went ofl", and in less than
half an hour came back with fruit, dry meat, and a kind
of corn, but I did not know what it was, as we did not
raise that kind in our part of the world. We did not
know how we should get these things, for we did not want
to go on shore, and they did not like to come to us, but at
last they put them on the edge of the shore and went off;
we were glad of this, for they were a wild set, and wore
no clothes.

"79 went on for ten or twelve days more, but did not
meet a ship, and my heart was full and sad. I thought we
would starve, and that I should die, and I could not help
but feel that it was all my own fault.

One day I gave Xury charge of the ship, and sat down
in one end, to think what I should do, and how I c0uld get
food, as we did not dare to go on shore, for fear of .wild
men and beasts. I was sad, and gave up all hope, when
all at once Xury cried, "A ship with a sail." How my
heart rose with joy, but poor Xury did not share it with
me, he thought it was the Turk who had come to take us
back. I saw that it was a. large ship, but could not tell
where it was from. They did not see us at first, so I took
a small flag that I had, and made a waft of it, and shot of
my gun for a sign; they did not hear the gun, but when
they saw the smoke, they brought to, and lay by for me,
and in less than two hours' time I came up with them.

The ship was from Spain, and bound for the south. A
Scotch man on board said to me, ""7110 are you, and

' where are you from '3 "

I told him how I had run from the Turk, and this he
told the man in charge, who said I must come on board,
and took both Xury and me, as well as all my goods in
his ship.

I was so sick of the sea, that I thought, " when I reach
the land I'will stay there "; and so when the man said he
would pay me for my boat, and buy Xury from me, I told
him he could have the boat, but Xury had been so good to
me, that I would not like to sell him for a slave.

He said, if Xury would be a good boy, he would set

_ him free in a few years, and as I was at a loss to know
what I should do with him, I let the man take him.

In a few weeks we came to the coast of a large land,
which lies south--west of my own land, and there I made
up my mind to stay.

The gold the man gave me for my boat and the things
that were in it, was quite a large sum, and I had ten pounds
at home with a friend, so I thought I would buy a farm.

While I>> went to look round for one, I met a man Whose
name was Wells; he had some stock but not much gold.
He thought he would like to buy a farm. He said to me,
that he thought if we would join our means, we could buy
a large farm and make it pay us well. I saw that he was
a good man and knew how to farm, so I sent to my friend
for my gold, and we bought a large farm near the coast.

I now saw what a help. Xurv would be to me, and I felt .
I had done wrong to part with him, for in a short time we
had to buy two more slaves to help us work our farm. -
The friend who sent me my gold, sent with it some cloth.
baize, dress goods, and some small wares, which I gave in
trade to the men where we were, and to those who came
on shore from the ships that went by, and in a few months
I was in a fair way tolmake a great deal of gold.

CHAPTER IIL

ALL went on well for four years, our stock grew fast,
and we were soon quite rich ; but this kind of a life did not
suit me, my old wish to ream came on, and in spite of all
I had gone through each time I went to sea, I felt I would
like to go once more. What more did I do here than I
would have done at home with my friends, and was it for _
this that I had left them all. No l I would go off as soon
as I could get a chance, and do some great thing yet.

My kind friend who had brought me here had been gone
for some time, and I felt bad that I had not gone with him.

One day while I was in this mood, three men came to
me and said they would like me to take a share in a large
slave ship they had, and go to sea in it. I told them I
would go with all my heart, if they would look out for my
farm, which they were glad to do. ' I made a sort of will,
in which I told the men what to do with my share in the
farm in case of my death, and made the man who had
brought me here, and who was so kind to me, my heir.

In a few days I set sail, which, strange to' say, was just
ei ht years from the day I had left home.

e had on board six onus. and a crew of ten men 63$?}A. big \izlw: mum: and <<me Cruwe up on um haul when: he had <<why am the mud. mom, a: it:

five boys. Our stock of goods was toys, beads, bits of
glass, shells, and such odd things. that we knew we could
trade for slaves. ' '

W'e soon lost sight of land, and for two weeks the sea
was calm, and the air clear and hot, and then there came
a teat change. One day there blew up a great gale and
a erce storm set in, and for three days we could not steer
the ship, she was thrown round in such a way, and the
high sees that came on us took off a man and a boy. In
the midst of this one of the men said he saw land, and we
thought we would try to reach it, but it was of no use, and
though we did all we could, we could not save the ship, it
struck on a sand bar. We could not move, and we could
not stay here, for we thought the ship would break in two.

There was a small boat on the ship, which the mate let
down, and we all got in, but did not have much hope, as
the sea was so wild and rough, and the storm so great.
We felt that naught but God's care could save us; we
' had gone but a short way, when there rose a great high
wave that fell on our boat, and swept us all out' into the
sea.

I was full of dread and fear, and thought there was no
hope for me, but as I swam round, I saw, quite a way off,
a piece of land, which I thought if I could reach I would
be safe.

With the aid of the waves I swam straight for it, and
when there the first thing I did was to thank God for my
life, and then to look for the rest of the men, but they
must have all gone down, for I saw them no more, 'nor a
sign of them, but three of their hats, one cap, and two
shoes, which were not mates.

I knew it would not do for me to sit still here, but must
\

- get up and look round me, and see what kind of a place I
was in, and as night was near, how and where I should
slee . .

Itp was too late to see much 01" the place, but not Far ad
I found a thick tree like a fir, full of thorns. I thought i
would make this do to sleep in, and though I saw no signs
of them, I was full of fear of wild men and beasts, so I
took my knife and cut me a sharp stick, and when it was
dark I got up in my tree, where I. slept- as well as I think
few could have done in my state.

When I Woke up the next morn, it was quite late, and
the sun shone bright and clear. I could see the ship as it
lay one end up out 01' the sea, not quite a mile off, and the
small boat, which was lost, was so far OH? I could but just
see it. At noon the sea was calm, and the tide low, so
that I could swim to the ship, and as it was warm, I took
off most of my clothes and laid them on the sand, and
went to the ship. - _

Here Ifound fresh cause for grief, for I saw if we had
kept on board we would all have been safe, that is to say,
we could all have got safe to .the land, and I would not
have been all that was left.~ ' At first I did not know how
to get up on the ship, but when I had swam round her
twice, I spied a small piece of strong rope that hung down
on one side, and with the aid of that, and hard work, I at
last got up on deck. ,-

You may be sure that my first work was to search for
bread, which, when I had, found it, I made a good meal 6H;
and then I went to fee what else' there was in the ship,
that I could take or shore.

But how could I get them there? I must have a boat
to do this. The small boat, as I have said, was too far
011', and there was none on the ship. It was in vain to sit
still and wish for what was not to be had. I found there
were some spare yards, 3. mast or two, some large spars of
wood, and some rope and planks. I thought l would go
to work and see what I could do with these, so [took some
rope and put it reund each of the spars, and flung them in
the sea, and then I threw the planks down, and when this
was done, I went down the ship's side, and put four of the
spars end to end, and with the rope I made them as well
as I could in the form of a raft, and laid two or three
short planks on it. I found I could walk on this, but it
was too light to hear a great weight. I then, with a saw
I had found, out one of the large masts in three lengths,
and put them to my raft.

This tool: much time and toil, but the fear that I would
starve kept me up. My raft was now quite strong and
large, and my next care was, what to load it with, and how
to save what I put on it from the surf of the sea. I first
laid all the loose planks and boards I could get on it, and
then I put on three chests which I had found in one of the
rooms of the ship. I thought one of the chests would be
just the thing for me to put my food in, as it would keep
it dry, so I put in it some bread, rice, cheese, dry meat,
and seme corn, which had been laid. by for some fowls '
which we brought to sea with us. I found a large case of
rum, but there was no need to' put that in. the chest, so I
put it up by the side of it.

By this time the tide was up, and though the sea was calm,
I saw my coat, vest, and shirt, which I had left on the sand,
float oft. This made me think of some clothes, and I went
down in the ship, and found some that had been worn by the
men, and I took all that I thought I would need for a time.Crusoe pub the tool chest, three good guns, 3. bag of shot. "We

CHAPTER IV.

I PU'I' all these- things on mv raft, and then set 011' for
the land. For a timeh my raft 11' out well; but as it was so
la1ge,a11d I had so much 011 it I could not use my oars,
and the sea was so strong, that I 11' as in fear I would not
reach the Sho1e, but drift out from it. So I had to sit

the tide to come in, _1-1-'hich it did in the course of an hour,
and sent 111v raft quite 1110'11 up on the s11o1e, and heie I

way, and then stuck the oars in the ground, one on each
side of the raft near the ends, which he1d it don-'11 straitrht
and so that it could not move.

When 1 had brought my goods upon the sham, I took
out 1111' pipe, and sat down to smoke. I thought of th
past, of mv friends at home; I knew they would think me

them word, or got off, for the isle I was 011 did not seem20 ROM/neon 6911809.-

to have a soul on it. It was out of the way of the course
of ships and trade, and though I could hear birds sing and
beasts cry, still I felt I was lost to the world, and felt sad
and sick at heart. .

While I sat here, a great bird flew by me and I shot at
it; I think it was the first gun that had been shot off on
the isle, for the fowls and birds flew out from all sides, and
set up loud cries of fright. The bird I took to be from its
beak a kind of hawk, though its claws were not like nor
near as large as a hawk's; 'it wasnot good for food, so I
threw it 011 the ground.

IVhat to do, or where to rest this 1'1ight, I knew not.
1 did not like to lie on the ground; my tree was too far
011', and I knew I must stay near my goods to watch
them; so I made a kind of but with the chests and
boards, and I laid down on some of the boards, but I. did
not sleep well, for the boards were hard, and I. had such
great fear of wild beasts.

The food I had brought frOm the ship I knew would last
me some days, and I had seen some hares run out of the
wood, where I had shot the fowl; still I felt I should need
more food soon, and there was some in the ship which
would be of great use to me, and I must get it on shore as
quick as I could, for the sea was so strOng at times I knew
the ship could not stand long.

The next morn, when the tide went out, I swam to the

em .

lily raft was so large that I left that on shore, and
thought I would make a small one when I got on the ship.
I did so, and then went to look through the ship. I found
two or three bags full of nails and spikes, some saws and
knives, and, to my great joy, a stone to grind my tools with.
I took all the men's clothes I could find, a spare top
sail, and a bed. I put these on my raft, and brought them
all safe to the shore.

I found my things just as I had left them. A wild cat
was up on one of the chests; my first thought was to
shoot her, but. as she did not seem to mind me, I threw a
piece of dry rusk at her, which she ate, and then ran ofl'.

I then went to work to make a small tent of some kind,
where I could stay and sleep, as well as store my goods
in. I put up one with the sail and some poles I had cut,
and brought in all my things that I thought the sun or
rain would spoil. I then stood all the chests and casks
round it, and made a door of some boards and a chest.
When this was done, I spread out my bed, put my arms
close by, and, for the first time since I had left the ship, 1
laid down and slept well.

I? or the next six days, when the tide was low, I went
out to the. ship, and thought that I had found all that I
would need, but as long as the. ship was there, I felt that
I must take off all that I could get.

In one of my trips 1. put so much on my raft that it
went down, and threw me and my goods into the sea, but
it did not do much harm, for I. took most of the things
out.

One day I found some gold; I said, "0 drug! what
art thou good for? Thou art not worth as much as one
of the knives in this heap." I made up my mind to
throw it in the sea, but then I thought, I may need this
some time, so I put it up in a piece of sail, and laid it by
in the tent. .

The last trip I made the wind blew hard, and drove me
out from the shore; I was in fear that I would not reachRobinson (ll-uses. 28

it, but by hard 'work, and the aid of the tide, I got on land
all safe, and I put up all my goods, forI knew there would
be a. storm.

It blew hard all night, and the next morn, when l woke,
I saw that the ship was gone. I felt sad, and as though I
had lost a friend, but I knew that I had brought on shore
all that I could use now, and so I soon gave up all thoughts
of her. As the spot my tent was on was not a fit place
for me to live, the ground was so low and wet, I went out
to search the isle, to see if I could find a dry place, from
which I could view the Sea, or see when a ship came in
sight. '

'I found a plain on the side of a hill, with a large rock
near by; a hole was worn in the rock like a door to a cave,
and there was a flat green in front of this hole. Ithought
I could fix the place where the hole was to put my food
in, and I would build my tent in front of it on the green.

I went right to work. First I drove two rows of large
stakes (the space of ten yards from the rock), so close that
they stood firm like piles, and then with some of the rope
I had, I made the stakes tight, and then I put some of the
boards and planks on to them, and in this way I made a
strong fence that would keep out both man and beast.

I then built my tent, in fact two of them, a small one
first, with a large one round it, and I put one of my thick
sails on the top of the large one. The way into this place
was from the top, by means of a pair of steps I had made,
which I could pull in with me when I went in. \Vhen it
was all done, 1 brrulght all my goods and stores in here,24 I 1303mm

CHAPTER V.

I WENT out at least once a day with my gun, to see
what I could kill that would be fit for food. One day I
saw some goats, but they were so shy that it was hard
work to get near to them.

The first shot I made, I'shot an old goat with a small
kid, that stood near by, and when the old one fell, the kid
stood stock still, till I came up to her. I felt so sad, that
I. laid' the old dam down and took the kid. up in my arms
to pet her, and I thought if I could, I would brin her up
and tame her, but she would not eat, so I had to iill her.

The flesh of these two goats kept me in food for a long
time, for which I was glad, as I did not want to eat up all
my bread, for though it was dry and hard, I did not see
how I was to get more when this was gone.

In a few weeks more I found a youn kid that was lame,
and I led her by a string to my tent. I took great care of
her, and by the time she was well, she was quite tame. I
soon had a chance to catch some more, and it was not long
when I had quite a flock of goats, and all the milk 'I could
use.

My great thought, night and day, was how should I live.
"What could I do, way off here in tl'iis'lone isle '! The
tears would run down my face, and I would say, "Oh!
how I dread this lone life." Then the thoughts would
come: "Well, you are here, but where are the rest? Why
is it that you were not lost? Is it best to be here or in
the sea"' And I would make up my mind to wait, and
watch for a ship, and that if I was to go back home, it
would be all in good time.

As the days went by, I must make a note of time, or I
should lose sight of" the days and years, but I did not know
how to do it, for want of books, pens, and ink; so With
my knife I made out of some posts a great cross, and set
it up near the shore. I put on it, " I came here the first
of Sept, 1659," and each day I cut a notch, so I could tell
the days of the week, month, and year.

I did not have to lie in my bed all the time. I had
found a swing in one of the rooms of the ship, which had
been the mate's, and in this I would sleep in place of' my bed.

I did not tell you of the two cats that I brought in my
arms from the ship, nor of' the dog who swam to the shore
with me at the same time. The dog was a great pet, and
a true friend for years; he would hunt. for things and bring
them to me; he would do a great deal, but could not talk.
I thought, if' he could but speak to me and tell me his
thoughts, and I could tell him mine, how glad I should be!

My tent was so small that I could not get at half of my
goods, which lay in a heap on the floor; so I took down
the small one, and one side of the large one, and built it
out for a long way, and then I had a chance to look well
at my goods.

In a box which I had brought from one of the rooms in
the ship, I found What made my heart jump for joy--a
lot of blank books, pens, and some ink. The ink I knew
I should have to use with great care, for I could not make
more when this was gone, but I made up my mind while
I had it, I would write down each night all that I saw,
and what took place through the day, as well as the good
and bad thoughts of the day.
This gave me great peace of mind. My book grew to
be, to me, like a friend I could talk to, and I s00n saw
that we all have more cause for joy than grief, if we will
but look in the light light at what is sent us, and that
I should be full of' thanks to God, who was so good to
me, when I had done so much that was wrong, and left
all at home, just to have my own way.

The next thing now for me to do was to make a, chair
to sit on, and a stand to write and read by, as well as to
eat from. These I made out of the short boards I had
brought on my raft from the ship. I could not build much
at a time, as I had so few tools. When I was in need of
a. board, I had to cut d0wn a tree and set it on edge by
me, how it flat on both sides with my ax, and then rub it
smooth with my adzc, and I could make but one board
from a tree.

When I had wrought out some boards in this way I
made some large shelves, and put them up all round on
the sides of my tent. I laid all my tools and nails, and
such things as I COuld, on them, and hung up my guns,
and soon had my things where I could get at them, and
could keep them and my tent neat and clean.

Each day, when l was through with my work, I would
walk up to the top of the hill, to see if there was a ship
or sail in sight, and when I came back, would sit down
and cry like a child; my dog and cats would come up to
me and lick my hands, and look at me in such a way as
though they would like to help me, which would soothe
me a great deal. I wrote my notes for a year, and' then
had to stop, as my ink gave out, and I had no way to get
more; but those that [wrote Were a great help to me all
the time I was on the
One day I caught some wild birds, a kind of dove, which
I thought 'I would tame. I did so, and their flesh made
good food. As time wore on, I found I would need some
more lights, for when it was dark I had to go to bed. 1
had some goats' fat, which I made soil: by the fire, and
then I made a wick to put in it from a piece of old rcpc,
and with the aid of the sun to dry it, 1 made a small dish
of' clay, and in this way I had a lamp, and quite a good
Ii rht. .
II had some le'll left, which was so dry that I thought
I could not use it, but the bag would be good to keep
some of my things in; so I threw the corn out on the
ground. In a few days the rain set in for a month, and
when they were through, I saw one day a few green
stalks; they were quite small, and I did not know what
they were; but what was my joy in a week's time, to find
that it was the corn which had sprung up; and when that
same day I took my walk, I found on sides of the rock,
young stalks of rice, and a small grain which grows quite
thick in some lands; but how it came here I could not tell,
for this was not the right soil or place for it.

CHAPTER VI.

ONE day I was at work in my tent, when I felt a great
shock; the earth shook so hard that I thought the top of
my tent would fall in; one of the posts gave way, and 'I
.was in great fear. I ran out to see what was the cause of
this. I found the ground loose, and the dirt and stones
thrown up all round; then I knew it was one of those
shocks that I had heard take place on the isles in the'6

. ge'egwm

ITHE m

"a."
South. The shock was just as strong on the sea, for if
threw the ship quite high up on one end, near the shore.

When the shock came, I thought that I would have to
seek a. new place for my. tent; but the sight of the wreck
drove these thoughts out of my mind, for I felt that I
must see what I could bring from the wreck. I knew I
should need all I could find. 1 went each day for a month.
There was not much in the ship that I could use, as it had
lain so long in the sea; but with the aid of my an and
flew, I brought back all the planks and boards I could get
oose.

On one of these trips, as I came up the hill, I spied a
great crab on its back in the sun; I caught it, and the
eggs and flesh were to me the best food I had had since I
came on the isle. , _

The rain came on for a. few days, and I felt cold, whic
I thought was strange, as I ought not to feel cold here, for
as near as I could make out the isle was not far from the -
Line. The next day I had a hard chill, and then a. great
heat With faint sweats, and for two weeks I was quite ill.
I was too ill to use my gun, and most dead with thirst; I
was too weak to go out to get a drink, and as I lay on my
bed, my whole thought was, "What shall I do?" All
that I had gone through had not made me pray or think
of God, as I should haste done. When I found the green
corn, I did think for a. while that: it was one more proof of
God's love, but my heart was hard, and I soon let the
cares of each day take up my mind, and did not stop to
bless or thank Him.

One night I had a strange dream: I saw a great black
cloud, and back of it a bright flame, which shone on the
ground, and a. man came out of the cloud; his face shone32 7263wa 'Ghsoe.

like fire, and he held a spear in his hand; the earth shook
and the air was full of fire. The man said to me: " Thou
wilt not pray, nor turn and love me, new thou shalt die";
and he took up his spear as if he meant to kill me. I
gave a cry and a start, which woke me up.

This led me to think of my sins, of my friends at heme,
and What they had told me when 9. hey, and that it was all
my own self will that had brought me here lone and sick;
and yet God had been so good to me to save my life, and
I thought, " He sees and knows all things; He can cure
me; I will pray to Him and learn to love Him."

The next day I was quite weak and ill at ease ' my fit
did not come on, but the dream was in my mind. I made
a search for that best of all books, God's "70rd, and found
it in one of the chests. The first words that I read were,
"09.11 on me,1 will help thee"; and I knelt down and
sent up the cry, "Son of God, he with me; help me to
love Thee and teach me to pray."

This was the first time since a child that I knelt down
to pray to God, with a sense that He was near, and that
He would hear and help me. My mind was now at ease,
and that night I laid down and slent well, and when I
woke the next morn I felt quite well

I read my book night and morn, and I soon found that
I had a dear Friend, to whom I could go and get peace.

I had heard when I was on my farm, that-to take the
weed men smoke, and put it in some rum to steep, and
then to drink the rum, it would cure the chills; so I made
some of this, and took a dose of it for a day or two, and
it did work a cure for me, as I was sick no more while I
was on the isle.

I thought of the shock that took place, and when the
rain was gone, and I grew strong, I made up my mind
that it was best. for me to make a tour of the isle, and see
if I could find a good place where I could go in case there
should be more of them, as well as to see what I could get
to eat.

It is true I had the flesh of the goats and birds, and the
eggs of the large crabs I found, but my bread was gone,
and I was sick. of these. '

I brought my raft on the shore, out of the reach of the
tide and waves, and went on foot up the creek for two
miles, where I found that the tide did not flow, and the
sea ran in a small brook, which was fresh and clear, and
en the banks of this brook the grass grew thick and green.

There was a small ridge of hills near here, and a fresh
spring rose out of the side of one of the hills, and lime
trees and grape vines grew on all sides. The grapes were
in their prime, ripe and sweet.

In front of the hills there was a smooth green plain,
with plants and fruit Vines that ran on the ground. rI'he
place had such a charm for me, and it was so high up on
the isle, that I felt it would be a good spot to stay and
rest for a few days. I thought it best to put up some sort
of a place to sleep in; I was still weak and could not do
much, but I built a small hut of green brush and leaves.

The first night I did not sleep well, I was so far from
my tent, and I thought of my pets and goods that I had
left there.

I spent two or three days here, and then went back to
my tent, where I found all things safe. I took with me
all the fruit I could bear, and hung the grapes in the sun
to dry them; and when I took them down they were sweet
and good, and I saw that I could keep them for a long time.34 I 3(7sz Gimme.

I found, by my post, that I had been on the isle for one
year, and had seen no signs of a ship yet. I made up my
mind that I shOuld have to dwell here for a. longtime, and
must think of how I should live, and What was best for
me to do.

I thought I would like some bread, but to have this 1
must have the meal, and to get the meal I must raise the
corn and grain. But I had no tools to work with; and
how could I do all this? I dug up the ground with a
spade I had made of wood; as I had no plow, and took the
bough of a tree for a rake, and with these 1 put in a part
of the corn, some rice, and the small grain, a few stalks
of which I had found on the isle.

They did not yield much the first year, as it was sown
too late, and the next year, the hares would tread it down
at night, and the birds would eat it in the day time; I
made a trap to catch the birds and set my dog to hunt the
hares, and I put a hedge all round the field, which kept
out my goats, and at the end of the third year I had a
good crop of all that was sown.

My goats would stray off, and go with the wild ones,
and it took me some time to hunt them up and tame them,
so I laid out a large piece of ground to keep them in, and
put a thick hedge around it, and put up small pens to
drive them in; and at the end of a year and a half I had
a flock of twelve goats, kids and all, and in two years
more, two score and three. It took me three months to
plant my hedge and put up a pole or fence by it, but this
was a help to me to pass my time, for the days were long
and drear.

You would smile were you to see me and my pets sit
down to dine. First, there I was, prince and lord of theCrusoe had to use his sword to cut down the corn and rice

whole isle, and Poll on the back of my chair, and my dog
at my feet, with my cats on each side of me, all on the
watch for the bits that I would feed them from my hands

CHAPTER VIL

.i DID not have much time to sit still through the day,
for it could, with truth, be said of me, " With the sweat of
thy face, shalt thou eat bread "; but when the day's work
was done, I would sit in the door of my tent, with my dog
on one side of me, the cats at my feet, and P011011 my
hand,

Poll was a young bird I- had caught, and I took a great
deal of pains to teach her to talk, and the first time she
spoke her name, it gave me a great start, I had not heard
a voice but my own for so long.

As I now had so much corn and rice, I thought of my
bread. '

I sat one day for a long time to think how I should
grind my corn and bake my bread. First, I must have
some pots or jars to keep my meal in. I thought of my
clay lamp, and went to work to make a sort of paste with
the clay and sand that was on the beach. You would
laugh were I to tell you the ways I tech to make this
paste, and What odd things I made; how some of them
fell in and some fell out, and some would crack with the
heat of the sun, but I ke t on, and at last, with the aid of
the sun to bake them, I had .two large pots to keep my
meal in.

Though these were quite dry and hard, I saw that they
werenet- strong, I could not bake 91: cool: in them, norWhen the day's work was done, Crusoe would sit in the door
of his tent with the dog and the ants at his feet, and Poll on his
hand, teaching her to Wise--Page 86. Robinson 0mm.
use them for half of my things. One day a piece fell in
the fire, and when I took it out I found it was burnt as
hard as a stone, and as red as a tile. I now made up my
mind to burn all my pots, and in a few weeks I had anice
lot of large jars, round pots, and a flat dish. How glad I '
was, now I could bake bread, boil meat, and make some
broth.

I now sought the means to grind my corn and grain for
meal. I had no mill, so I thought I would stamp or beat
it out. I spent a great deal of time to find a stone, but as
I could not get one, I took a great block of hard wood,
and with my ax and knife cut a deep hole in it. I put my
grain in this hole, and with a short, thick piece of wood
beat it out fine. -

The next thing was a sieve to dress my meal, and part
it from the bran and husk. I had no goat's hair, nor could
I weave it if I had. This put a stop to my work for some
weeks; but one day I found a piece of thin cloth (such as
men wear round their necks for ties), which I had brought
from the ship. With this I made three small sieves, and
these I made last for some years.

Now that my grain was ground, and I had meal, I could
make bread, but how was I to bake it? I had made some
square red tiles, and put them all round my fire, like a
hearth; I built a large fire, and when it was all burnt up
to live coals, I drew them out on the tiles, and put'my
dough in a broad flat dish, and set it on the hot tiles, and
in a short time I had a nice loaf of bread. I now had all
the fresh bread and rice cakes I could eat.

I had now been on the isle four years, and still no ship
came by. I could see a piece of land some way ofi' from
the isle, and each day I would look at it and long to go38 ROM/Leon Omsoe.

on it, and see what there was there; but fear of the wild
men, that I thought might live there, kept me back.

I thought I would go and look at our ship's boat, which
had been blown up on the shore a great way of. I saw
that l would have to do so much to her, that it would be
best for me to make a new one. To do this, I cut down a
large tree, and took the trunk and made it in shape with
my ax and adze.

I did not stop to think how I should get it to the sea. I
thought, " Let me first make'it and I will find a way." It
took me three months of toil to do this, but I did not mind
that. I was full of hope, and thought what a good timcI
should have, and how I would sail of? in it.

When it was hewn out, fit for me to launch, it was so
large, that do all I would, I could not move it. I thought
I would dig atrench round it, and see if I could slide it out
to sea, but it was of no use; so I left it to go back to work
on my farm, and I felt that I must make up my mind to
end my days here.

I had large flocks of goats, good crops of corn and grain,
in fact all that I could eat, and the means to cook with.
The most I stood in need of now was clothes. I had worn
out all that I had brought from the ship, and I was now in
rags. When I would kill a goat or kid, I would save the
skin, and hang it in the sun to dry, and in this way I had
quite a large stock of nice skins. The first thing .I made
of these was a great cap for my head, and I made this so
well, that I made a whole suit. I put the hair of the skin
out, so that it would shed the rain. The coat was long
and loose, and made fast to the waist with a belt.

The next thing to make was a sort of shade, to take
'with me when I went out, to shield me from the sun andCrusoe out down a large tree, and took the trunk, and with
his tools dug it out and made it in the shape of a boat, but it; was

min. I made a frame and put a skin on it, but though I
could make it spread, I had hard work to make it let down;
but I did it at last, and found it of great use to me.

One year more went by, and this I think was one of the
best ones I spent on the isle ; I could not keep my thoughts
from a boat, and I went to work to make a small one.

When it was done, I put a mast and sail on it, andmade
a place to stow my arms and food in. I put my shade on
one end to shield me from the hot sun. I took a short sail
out, and I had such a good time that I thought in a. few
days I would take a long sail. So one morn, I put my gun
and some food with a case of rum in the boat, and set out
to View the isle, and see all that lay round it. This wasin
the sixth year of my reign on the isle.

CHAPTER VIII.

WHEN I had been out three days a great gale came up
and drove me out to sea, and I thought that I with my
boat would be lost. The fourth day the wind went down
some, and I put on all my sail, and the wind and tide took
me up on the end of the isle a great way from home.
Here I left the boat, and had to walk home; and when I
came to my place, I was so worn out that I laid down in
the shade of one of my trees and fell in a deep sleep.

For some time I kept at home, but one day I thou ht 1
would walk down and take a look at the boat. , hen
quite near it I saw the print of a man's foot in the sand--
toes, heel, and all parts of a. foot. I went up and down
the shore, but saw no one.

I went back to my tent as fast as I could. I could not
sleep that night, and for three days he close in doors,
but the want of food drove me out. took a look all
round, and as I saw no one, I thought the mark I had
seen might be the print of my own foot which I had left
there at some time, but still I could not get rid of my fear.

Two or three years more went by and I saw no signs of
men, and thought that the print of a. man's foot was not
so great a thing to fear, and that I had been weak to feel
so much fear. I now felt at ease, and would take short
sails in my boat, and take walks on the shore.

One day I Went up to the top of' a hill to look at the
sea; I thought I saw a boat, but it was so far off that it
did not look like more than a speck, but as I did not have
a glass with me could not make it out. I went on down
the hill to a part of the isle Where I had not been, when I
saw close to. the edge of the shore, a pit where there had
been a fire made, and all round were strewn skulls, hand:
and feet, and burnt bones of men.

At the sight of these I grew sick, and went up the hill
with all the speed I could, and when I came to my tent
burst in a flood of tears.

I took my boat up in a safe place, and brought sail and
masts, with all the things that were in her, home to my
tent, so that if they came they could not take them ofi'. I
kept on the watch for them all the time, and each day
would go up to the top of the hill to see if they were
there, but did not see them, nor a sign of' them, for a long
while, as I will show you. .

I went in the wood to cut down some small trees (to
make a fire of), and while I was there I saw back of a thick
branch of low brush a large hole, and in this hole two
large bright things like eyes, which sent a. flash on me. Iand--toes heel, and all parts of u foot--Page 39.
Robinwn Onuaa.mm A

tool: up a small stick of wood that was on fire, and went
to see what it was. As'I came up I heard a sigh, and
then a slight noise. This put me in a. cold sweat, but I'
went on, and when I came close to the hole I saw that it
was an old goat that had gone in there to die. I found
the hole to be the mouth of a cave. Just then my fire
went out, and the place was so low that I thought I would
not go in then, but wait till the next day. -

The next mom I took six lights with me and went to
the cave. I had to creep in, on my hands and knees,'
through a sort of strait for ten feet. When I got through
this, I saw that the roof rose up high, and that I could
stand up; and what a grand sight now met my View!
When I threw my lights round. the roof and sides shone
like gems, gold and bright stars. I stood for some time
lost in thought. _

I had been on the isle for so long, and this was the first
I knew of this strange and great place, and yet it was so
near my tent! I took care to bring in all I might want as
soon as I could, and felt that I had found a safe place to
hide in, and I could live there for some time.

Now for the first time I thought how dear to me were
all the things round me. My Polls, for I had two or
three, would call me by name as soon as I came in; my
dog and cats would bark and purr round me; my tame
birds would light on my head and back, and I had no
fears for want of food and drink. I. went back to my
work on the farm and the care of my flocks; and felt that
God, who had done so much for me, would help and save me.

In a few months from this time my good old dog fell
dead, right near the door of my tent. This made me feel
sad for a long time.
CHAPTER IX.

IN this way five or six more years went by, and I saw
no more signs of the men, and [thought it might have
been mere chance that had brought them on the isle; but
one day, I saw a smoke, and as near as I could judge two
miles down, and this time on'my side of the isle.

I ran back to the top of the hill, and laid down flat, and
took a good look at the place where it came from. I saw
that there was quite a large fire, with nine men round it.
'l'here were two small boats on the edge of the shore, in
which they had come. As soon as the tide went out, they
all got in the boats and went Jfi".

I went down to the spot, and saw from the bones and
skulls that lay all round, that they had come here to have
one of their feasts. I. went back to my farm, and took up
all that grew round my place that would lead them to
think I was there, and made it look as wild as I could. I
took in my steps, and I then sat down in my tent to think
what I should do.

Of course, for along time I did not do much on my
farm. I had food, and my goats gave me all the milk I
could drink, and I kept close watch for near a year for the
men.

One night in the spring the wind blew hard, and I knew
we should have a storm. I put up all my things for the
night, took in my guns, and sat down in my tent to read
God's Word, when I heard a gun, and in a short time I
heard it once more. This I knew was not the wild men,hill with all the speed he coukl, and when he came to his tent,

burst imp a flood of tears--Page 40. 3mm>> 0mm.
but thought that it came from some ship at sea which was
in need of aid. -

I ran to the top of the hill, in hopes that if it were so I
could see them, or they could see me, and I built a large
fire, as a sign for them ; but the wind blew so that it was
hard to keep my fire up, and it was so dark that I could
not see a thing; but I kept on as well as I could till the
next morn, when to my grief I saw that it was aship which
had struck on the same sand where our ship had been lost.
[ could not tell if there were men in it or not. Now for
the first time in years I got my boat dawn, and put the
mast and sail in it, and as much food and drink as I
thought I would need, and put my large shade in one end,
and then set sail for the ship.

'I did not think of the wild men. All my hope now was
to see if 1 could save the lives of some of those who might
be on board; and so great was this hope, that I could
scarce wait to reach the ship. In less than two hours I
came up to it ; but all was still. i A dog that was on deck
was all that was left. in the ship that had life. He came
at me with a cry and bark, and was most dead for food
and drink. I. gave him some bread, and a. drink from
a jar I had with me, and then I put him in my
boat.

I went down to search the rooms, and found in one of
them two dead men, but the rest were gone. There were
some large casks of wine and rum down in the holdof the
ship, but'they were too large for me to lift; but I found
two chests, a. good spy glass, three large flasks, a pair of
tongs, a small pot, and some good shirts. I put all these
in my boat.

[new wentback to the isle. I had been gone three44 1?an Crusoe.

days, but I found all my things as I had left them, that is,
my goats, cats and birds.

When 1 came to look in the chests I found in one of
them three large bags of gold; but what good was that to
me? I would give it for some good shoes or socks, or
some seeds from home; but I laid it by with the rest I. had,
in hopes that at some time it might help me to get home,
or aid me when I was there.

One morn I went out to see to my boat, when I saw five
small boats 0n the shore, quite close by, and near them
full three score black men.

I ran home and put up all my tl-xings as safe as I could,
and stuck my ax and sword in my belt, took my gun and
my glass, and went up to the top of the hill to watch
them. I saw that they had a fire and some kind of meat,
but I could not tell What it was. They all sat down as I
thought to eat it.

CHAPTER X.

WHEN they were through, I saw some of them get up
and dance in their way round the fire, while some went
off; they soon came back, and brought with them two
slaves, bound hand and foot. They took off their hands,
and left one to stand while they went to work to cut one
u .

-le1en the first one found he was free, he ran oil", and
straight in the road to my house. When the rest saw him
run, they all gave full chase.

I went down to m tent, with all the speed I could, and
got one more gun. thought " I will try to save the pom
man if I can." I found that all but two had gone back,
and the poor slave was quite close to me. I (lid not like
to fire, for I did not want the rest to hear; so I made a
sign to the slave to come up to me, and then I went up to
the men. The first one I gave a. hard knock with the end
of my gun, and he fell as though dead at my feet. The
one that was left then took aim at me with his bow,
and to save my own life I had to fire. I shot him
dead.

The fire and noise of my gun gave the poor slave su'ch
a fright that he could not move; so I made signs to him
to come to me, and that I would not hurt him. I did not
care to take him to my tent, but went with him to my
cave. Here I made a bed of rice straw for him, and then

' gave him some food and drink, when he laid down and
went to sleep.

I went out to milk my goats, and put up some things
for the night, and while I was at this he woke up, and
came out to me, and made all sorts of signs that he would
like to wait on me; and at last he lay his head down flat
on the ground close by my feet, and took one of them in
his hand and laid it on his head, and made a sign to me
that he would serve me as long as he should live. I let
him know that I was glad, and then I taught him a few
words and my name. I could not tell what his name was;
but I thought I would call him from the name of the day
on which I had found him, which was Friday. I wont to
work to see if I could make him some clothes.

' ' I found some things in one of the chests, and I made
him a goat skin coat and a hare skin cap. At first he said
they hurt him, and that he could not walk in them, and'he
went round ill at ease; but in a few days he said theythat he could not move, but Crusoe made 'a sign to him that he
would not but him--Page 46 mum>> 0mm.
were nice and all light, and was quite proud to think his
clothes were as good as mine.

I soon found that, to cure Friday of his taste for men's
flesh, he must have some kind of meat, and I thought I
would teach him to kill and dress game for both him and
me. One day I took him out to shoot and hunt with me.
I saw an old goat with two kids. I took up my gun, and
shot one of the kids. Poor Friday shook like a leaf in
the wind, and I thought he would sink to the ground.
He came up to me and knelt down by me, as if to pray to
me not to kill him. Isaw that I must find a way to show
him that I would do him no harm. I took him up by the
hand and told him to bring me the kid, and in a. short
time I saw a bird, and I made signs to him that I would
shoot it and it would fall. I did so. This made Friday
stand and look for a long time. I told him to pick it up;
he took it in his hand, and then gave it to me; he had
such a queer look on his face, as if to say, " Well, if you
will not kill me, that thing you have there will do it."
He would not touch the gun for some days, but would go
up to it and talk to it, and pray to it not to kill him. In
a few weeks this fear wore off, and he would take the gun
and go out to shoot and hunt as well as I did.

CHAPTER XI.

WHEN we got home I made some broth of a part of the
kid, and took the rest to roast; and when I had fed Friday
with the meat and broth, he made signs to me that he
thought it was good, and that he would eat man's flesh no
more, which I was glad to hear. ': '
The next day I set him to work to beat and sift some
corn for me, and then I let him see me make my b1ead and
bake it; and 111 a few weeks F1iday could do all my w 0111
as well as I could.

As I had now two mouths to feed I knew I would have
to raise more grain, and this would make mo1e work 011
my farm. I told Fridav he must help, which he was glad
to ydo, for his whole mind was, What he could do to show
his love fo1 me. _

I thought I would like to know how he came to be with
those men, and if he w011ld like to go back to his own
land; so I said to him:

"How Is it that you were in the hands of those men
thai't brought you here. '3"

"There was a great ficht with their tribe and my
tribe, and my king had to give up, and they take me 111th
a. lot 1n01e men, and make us slaves and bring us here to
eatR us up."

" Could not your tribe fight and beat them 'l "

F." Yes, yes, we fight the best, but they more than my
tribe in the place where me was.'

R. " But why did not your t1ibe get y 011 from their
hands then. '5 "

"They run one, two, three and me, and make me
goF in the boat. My tribe have no boat at that time."

R." Well, Friday y, what does your tribe do 11ith the
$3111! "they take? Do they take and eat them as these

F " Yes, my tribe eats mans too; eat all up."

R. " Where do they take them '9"

F. " Go to place where they think."

3. " Do thepy come here? "yWhen Crusoe had fed Friday with the meat and broth. he
made signs to Crusoe that he would eat man's flesh no more.>>
Page 47. Robinson Grusoc,a>> '

50 Robinson W.

F. " Yes, they come here; come else place too."

" Have you been here with them?"

"Yes, I been here" (and points to the N. W. side of the
'sle, which it seems was their side).

I told him a. part of my life,.and how I had been cast
on the isle, and of our ship; and one day I took him .to
the wreck of the ship. He stood for a long while, as if in
deep thought, and then said: "Me see such boat like come
to place at my tribe"; and now for the first time I thought
that the white men, from the ship that was lost, might
have gone to his place, and I said to him : " Were there
white men in the boat?" He said, with some warmth,
" Yes, the boat full of white mans. We save the white
mans from drown." Said I: "Where are they now?"
I [e told me " They live, they dwell at my tribe." "Well,
how did it come that you did not kill and eat them?" He
said: "We no eats mans but when they make war fight";
by which he meant such as come to fight with them.

One day when we were on the top of a hill on the east
side of the isle, Friday gave a loud cry--"Oh joy! Oh
glad! There see my land; there my friends!" " Do you
wish to be back in your own land?" I said to him. "Yes
I be much 0 glad to be at my own tribe."

" What would you do there?" said I. "Would you
turn wild and eat man's flesh as you did once?"

With a shake of his head, he said: "No, no! Friday tell
them to live good; tell them to pray God; tell them eat
bread, drink milk; 110 eat man more."

"Why, then," said I, "they will kill you."

With a grave look, he said: " N o, no! they no kill me;
the will love to learn." ' ,

then said to him: "Will you go back to them '3"Friday said he would go back to his own land if Crusoe would
so with him, for he said there were some more white men than
---Pn,go 51. Bowman 0mmL

He said, with a smile, that he could not swim so far '
I told him I would make a boat for him. '

He said he would 0 if I would go with him.

"I go!" says I. " hy, they will eat me if I go there."

"No, no!" says he; "me make them no eat you; me
make them much love you." The next day I took him to
see the boat, and when he got in I saw he x'vas quick, and
could make it go as swift as I could. He said the boat
was too small to go to his land, and I told him that I would
make him a big boat, and he could go home to his tribe;-
He gave me a deep, sad look, and then took his ax from
his belt and told me to kill him.

" What must I kill you for? " I said.

" Why you mad at me? Why you send Friday ofl"!
You go with Friday."

" What will I do there?" _

" You teach them know God, pray God, live new life;
you teach wild mans be good, like you teach me."

I saw that he was true, and that I did not need more
proof of his love; so I told him that he should stay with
me, and that when he went I would go with him.

From this time my mind was made up to build a large
boat, and to go with him to see if I could find the white
men he spoke of.

CHAPTER XII.

FRIDAY and I went to see if we could find a large tree
that We could cut down and get near to the shore, so that
we could launch our boat when it was done; for I thought
of the one I had made and could not use.
We found one that Friday thought would do. It was a
strange kind of wood to me, but hard and strong. "'0
both took a great deal of pains to make it. W hen I was
through I felt quite proud of it. It was good shape, large,
and I had no doubt but that it would sail well.

One day I sent Friday to the shore to see if he could
find one of those large crabs, which I thought would be
nice to take with us. He had not been gone long when I
saw him on the run, and heard him cry: " O sir--i O sir!
0 sad! 0 bad 1 " '

"Then he came up to me I said: " What is it, li'riday '3 "

"Oh! there one, two, three boats! one, two, three! "

Poor Friday shook so hard, and was so full of fear that
they had come to take him back, and that they would kill
him and eat him up, that it took me some time to soothe
him. I told him not to mind them; but that he must do
just as I told him to, and said :

" We can fight them, Friday."

He said: "Yes; me shoot."

" Will you stand by me, Friday, and no as I bid you? "

He said: "Me die when you bid me die."

I took my glass and went up on the side of the hill, and
from there 1 saw that there were three boats, and more
than a score of men, who had just come on land, and
brought with them three men bound hand and foot, and
that they had come to hold one of their feasts.

' I made up my mind I would put a stop to this, and
would go down and shoot them all. I told Friday to
come and keep close to me, and not to shoot till I bid him,
and by no means to speak a word.

When I came to the skirt of' the wood, on the side
which was next to them, I told Friday in a low tone to go\Hvilc FY wr-nt h: flgh' than L'mme wan. unto the pom white man md will: 1
the bxnda fin: bound km and mid him In 39!. Inn--mags .13. Mum Chaos.Rab't'mon We've. I ' 33
to a large tree and look, and bring me word if he oould

see what they were at. _

He came back and said that they had made a fire, and'
had three hound men close by; that one of them was a
white man, and he knew they meant to kill and eat them;
in fact, he thought that one of them was dead. When I
heard that they had a-white man, it made my head swim,
and I was full of rage; so I went to a place near by, where
I could see all they did, and found that they had sent two
of their men to kill the white man, and would soon cook
and eat him up like the rest.

I knew that I had no time to lose. I said to Friday:
"Do as I bid you, and just as you see me do. Do not
fail."

He said "Yes," and when I gave the word "fire," he
shot at them the same time I did.

The men ran in all sorts of ways, with loud yells and
cries of flight, and went for their boats; and then Friday
and I shot at them once more. I thought we had shot
them all, for they all fell down in a heap in the boat; but
in a short time two of them got up and came on shore,
when Friday made a rush at them, at which they took to
their heels, and were soon with all the rest far out to sea.

While Friday went to fight them, I went up to the poor
white man, and out with my knife the hands that bound
him, and told him to get up; but he was too weak to
speak or stand.

While I was with this man Friday went to look at a
poor wretch, who lay bound in a boat the men had left in
their fright to get off. He cut the bonds that bound him,
at which he gave a groan, for he thought Friday was one
of the men who had come ' - '11 him. When I heardhim54 ROW/won Crusoe.

groan I left the White man (who by this time could sit up
and talk), and went to see what I could do for the poor
black man. I gave him a large dram of rum, which, when
he had drank it, made him come to, and he sat up in the
boat and spoke to me.

When Friday heard him speak and saw his face, he took
him in his arms and gave him a hug and a kiss; and then
he wrung his hands and beat his own face and head like a
mad men. For a long while he did not speak, and then
toll me that he was this man's son.

Now that these poor men Were free, and it was quite late
in the day, I thought we must get them to our tent. They
were so stiff and sore that they could not move, so I gave
Friday some rum to rub their arms and hands and feet
with.

I said to Friday : " Did you give this man some bread?"

He said: " None, bad dog, eat all up self."

I ave him some cakes of bread I had with me, and I
saw 1riday run of? as swift as a deer, but in a short time
, he came back with a jug, that he had gone way back to
our farm for, that he might give the poor old man a fresh
drink from our spring. We all took a drink, and the men
by this time were quite at ease; but as they could not
walk, Friday and I made a sort of hand chair, and took
them to my place. '

But when we came there we found that we could not
get them in my tent, for they could not climb my steps;
and as they must have a good place to rest in for the
night, Friday and I made a small tent with some poles,
and put- olcl sails on the top, and then made two nice bed
of rice straw for them to lie on. '

I sent Friday down for our arms, and all the things thatmm.

we had left on the shore, and in the mean time I cut up :2
youn kid and went to work to boil or stew some of i. ,
and made them both a. good dish of broth, with somc
rice in it.

CHAPTER XIII.

FRIDAY soon came back with the things I had sent him
for, and we had our meal; and then I told him to put the
men to bed, and stay with them for the night, for they
might want him.

The next mom I had a good long talk with the men,
and the white man, whom I shall call Frank, told me that
he had come from Spain, and that he, with some more
men, had been in the ship that was lost, and they went in
the small boat to the main land, where they found naught
but wild men; and as they could not get off from them,
they had made them (the white men) their slaves.

' The old man had such a queer name that I thought I
would call him Jack.

Frank said, that he thought if we went to the place
where they had come from, the rest of the white men that
were there would be glad to come back with me and serve

me.
So I went to work first to make my tent and eaves more

safe, and then Frank and I with the two black men did
naught for a year and a half but work on my farm, and
when I felt that I had what would keep us all, or that we
could raise it, I sent Frank and Jack out on a boat, to see
if they could find them and bring them back to me.
They had been gone eight days, when one morn, Friday56 120mm Gum

came in the tent to me and said, " 0! air, they are come
they are come!" and I thought our men had come, and
ran out with all the speed I could to meet them, but I soon
found that it was a. strange ship, and not on my side of
the isle

I thought I had best watch them for a while; so I saw
.them put out a long boat, and put three men that were
bmmd in it, and then five men got in and they all came to
the shore.

"Then they had all got up on the land, I saw one of the
men raise his sword to strike one of the bound men, who
hung his head, as if he would let him 10 what he would,
then he did the same to the rest, and then set them free.

The five men then went to the boat, but the tide was so
low, they could not get her of? the sand; so they sat down
near by, and the three men who had been bound,1 92'!) off
a short way and ]aid down in the shade of a tree.

I now went to my tent, took all the arms I thought
Friday and l could use, and went back to the men on the
ground, and said to them, " Sirs, why are you here, and
who are you 2 "

One man spoke, and said: " My name is John Smith;
we have come from Hull, and that is my ship out there,
and we were bound to the South Sea isles, and on the way
out, some of my crew grew rough and rude, and said they
would not mind me and put me in chains; and now they
have'thrust me, (with my mate and this man), out here to
die. They mean to go back to the ship, and make the
rest go with them where they please."

" Have they fire arms?" I said. -

" They had two guns which they have left in the boat."

" Well. then," said I, "leave the rest to me. I see that
they are air to sleep now. It will not be a hard task to
kill them all."

I saw that I could trust him, and I gave each of them a
gun, and went up near to the men.

One of our men made a, slight noise, which woke up two
of them, and they spoke to the rest, at which they made a
spring for us. I told our men to fire. They did so, and
we shot two of them. There were now three of them left,
and one of these had a slight wound, and they ran for the
boat; but Friday had gone down to it, and brought up the
oars and sails and the guns, and now, of course, they could
not get off. They were in a great rage, but at last they
made up their minds to yield to us, and we hound them
hand and foot, and took them up to my place. The men
who were bound I put in a safe place, and the rest of us
went to my tent, where we had a good meal, and then sat
down to talk and rest.

CHAPTER XIV.

WE knew that the rest of the crew would soon come to
find the first ones, and that we must in some way get the
best of them.

We all went down and broke a large hole in the boat,
and drew it up quite high on the sand, and what few
things there were in it I gave to Friday to take to our tent.
While we were at work we heard a gun fire. It came from
the ship, and was a sign for the men to come back; but
when the men on the ship found the boat did not move,
. they let down a small boat, and ten men got in it and
came to the shore. _130me7: 0mm 69

When the men came up to where the boat lay, and saw
that there was no one in it, three of them went up and
down the shore, and sent up loud yells to make their
friends hear; but as this did not seem to do, they all but
one (whom they left to watch the boat) came on shore, and
went oi? to the south side of the isle, and had a. long talk.
The came back in a short time, and we thought they
wo d all go of to the ship, and we would lose them and
the ship; so I sent Friday and the mate down a. short. way
and told them to call, which they did, and the men ran up
and down, to hear where the noise came from.

In a. short time three of the men came close up to us,
and at a sign from me Friday and the mate shot at them.
One fell dead, the next was hurt, and the third cried out,
" Who are you 2 " The mate said: " I am the mate, and
you must yield, or you are all dead men."

He said: "' To whom must we yield "l "

" To John S. He is here with the king and five score
men, and if you do not yield you are all lost."

They laid down their arms, and in a short time they
were bound hand and foot, and .ll'riday and Jack took
them to the cave, where Friday kept watch all night.

We thought it best to keep them there for a few days,
and gave Friday charge of them, and he took them food
and drink three times a day.

John S. and the mate went to the ship in the small boat
the men came in; and when they got to the ship there
were but three men on the deck, and one of them was the
man who had been the head of the gang. John S. and
the mate soon put him out of the way, and the rest of the
men were glad to be free, for they did not wish to harm
John 8., but fear of the bad men had made them act asco Robina>> am

they did. They said they would work for him, and help
him to take the ship home. They then went down in the

' ship, and when they had put things to rights in her, they
brought her up to the isle.

When she came up to the shore I was up on the top of
the hill, and John S. came up to me and said: " My dear
friend, there is your ship, for she is all yours, we are yours,
and all that is in her is yours." -

This was too much for me, and I was like one that was
dumb, and I sank faint to the ground. I shed tears of
joy. There was the ship, her sails set, and her flags thrown
out to the wind, and I could now go home. I gave my
Friend a hug and told him I would go with him, for I felt
that he had been sent to me from God.

We went down on board of the ship, and John S. gave
me a whole suit of clothes, which I put on. I felt strange,
and could scarce get round in them. I thought of poor
Friday the first time he had his clothes on. John S.
thought we ought to go right off, but I told him we ought
to see to the men that were bound in the cave. I went to
them and told them I had come from the King, and he had
said that I might set them free if they would swear they
would stay on the isle and work the land, for if they went
back with us they would all be hung for what they had
done on the ship. I set them all free, and I gave them in
charge of Frank and Jack, and I told Frank I would send
him some men from his own land as soon as I could. '

I took Friday, one of my polls, my goat skin cap and
coat, with all the gold I had laid by so long, and went 'on
board the ship ; and the next day, when I had bid all good
bye, we set sail for home. , "

I had: been on the isle a score and eight years, and toCrusoe took Friday, one p011, his goat skin cap and coat with
the gold he had and went. on board the ship, and the next day
set sail for home.--Ba.ge 60' Robinson Crusoe.I 113an 02m 61

whose love and care did I owe all, my life and health,
these friends, with the way and means to at home to my
own land'! It was on this isle that I had een brought to
know God, and my heart rose in praise to Him, and I
knelt down to thank Him for all He had done for me.

CHAPTER XV.

WE had fair winds and a good time most of the way to
Hull, for it was from here that John S. had brought the
ship, and he thought he ought to take it back to the same

lace.

P When I went to my old home in York, What a change
I found there! It is true, there was the stream, and the
house stood there still, and the farm was the same, but my
dear friends were all gone, and the stones at the head of
their graves in the yard back of the old church were all
that was left to tell me the sad news of when and where
' they were gone. '

As I had no cause to stay here, I thought I would go
down and see the men I had left my farm with, and see
what they had done.

I set sail for the south as soon as I found a ship that
went that way. When I got to my farm I found that
Wells, the man Who had bought the farm with me, was
dead, and the rest of the men whom I left in charge, had
made up their minds that I too was dead, for they had not
' heard from me; and as they did not wish to stay there,
the had sold my farm.

then went to hunt up the man who took me to sea the
first time.62 mm

He was quite glad to see me, and told me how and
where he had been since he left me. He thought I ought
to stay in my own land, and take my gold and buy a
farm. He said, he thought I could get a good price for a
piece of land that I had near my old farm, and he wrote
to a. friend of his to sell it for me, which he did, and I was
paid such a large sum for it, that with all the rest I had I
was quite rich. So, I thought I would seek a place to live
in, but my old wish to roam came on, so I thought I
would see some more of the world, and I went to France,
and from there to Spain. Of course, Friday went all
round with me,-and the poor man did not know what to
make of all the new and strange things he saw.

When I had gone round for some months, I went back
to the land of my birth, and there I met a fine young girl
whom I made my wife.

I bought a large farm with a good house on it, and for
some years dwelt there in rest and peace. I was rich, and
had no need to work hard. In time I had two sons, and I
found my spare hours could be well spent with them. I
taught them to work on the farm, and I felt the truth of
some lines I had once read:

"Free from vice, free from care,
Age has no pain, and youth no snare."

But right in the midst of all this joy, there came a great
blow to me, and this was the death of my good wife.

Her loss was so great to me, and my home was now so
sad, that I could not stay there in peace; each turn I made
brought my wife to my mind.

In a few months from the time I lost my wife, the son
' of a near friend of mine came to me, and told me he
would like to go to sea if I would go with him. I had a

21.
Z
great wish to go back to the lone isle where I had been so
long. 1 told him if he would take me there I would be
glad to go to sea with him. This he said he would do,
and went off to get a ship and crew.

While he was gone, I sold my farm and made my will.
I gave to each of my sons a share of my wealth, and put
them in the care of the wife of my old friend. who had
been so good to me when I was a young man.

One bright day in the first of the year 1693, Friday and
I set sail with my young friend for our old home on the
isle. ,

When we had been out for some weeks, one dark night
one of the men came to me, and said he saw a great light
along way off. 1 could see that it was a large ship on
fire. "7 e told the men to hang out lights for a sign to
them that we saw them and would come and help them.

By daylight the next morn, three large boats came up
to 115, full of those that had been on board of the ship.

It was a French ship, and the poor folks were all in a
wild state. They had thought there was no hope for them,
when they saw our ship and felt that they were safe.
There was a young priest on board, and he went round to
soothe them, and when all were calm, he made them kneel
down and thank-God.

In a few days we. met' a ship that was on her way to
France, and we put. most of the poor folks on board, to go
back to their own homes. The young priest, with a young
man and a young girl, said they would like to go' to the
isle with me.

In four months from the time we left my home, we came
in sight of the isle. I said to Friday, "Do you know
where you are?"
He said with a smile and a clap of his hands. " Oh, you,
oh there! "

When we eznne near to the shore, I told the mate .to fire
off three guns, and hang out a white flag of truce, so as to
let those that were on the land know that we were friends;
and then l let dow , a small boat, and took the priest and
Friday with some men, and we went up the creek which
was near my old place. I told the men they must not go
on shore till i gave the word; but Friday caught sight of
poor old Jack, and I could not keep him in the boat.-
He ran up to him, and felt of him, and put both of his
arms round him. and gave him a hug and kiss, and then
took him by the hand and made him sit down on the
ground, so that he could talk to him.

For a week he kept this up, and would tell him all he
had heard and seen since he had left him. I thought if

all sons would act in this way, there would be no need for
God's fifth law.

CHAPTER XVI.

WHILE Friday was with J ack, I went on shore; I saw
my friend Frank on the top of the hill. He did not know
me; I went up to him and took off my hat, and said,
" Sir, do you not know me?" He gave his gun to a man
who stood near, and came up to me, and threw his arms
round me, and gave me a hug.- He said he was glad to
see me; that he had thought a good deal of me, but as he
had not heard from me for so long a. time, he had made
up his mind that he should see me no more. He then
made a sign to the man who had his gun, and bade him
go and call the men, and told me to come to my old place
Isent the men in the boat back to the ship, and took
the priest and we went to my farm; but I did not know it,
the trees had grown up so thick round it, that it was like
a dense woods, and they had built forts all round. I said,
" What are these forts for?"

Frank said, when he had told me all that he had gone
through since I left him, I would see that he had great
need of them. A

The man to whom he spoke when 1 first met him, now
came back, with ten men, and Frank said, " There are
some of the men who owe their lives to you." In the
dress they wore, it was hard work for me to guess who
they were, but Frank soon made it clear to both them
and me, and they came up to greet me, one by one, not
like plain mere.J but like men of rank would come to a
King.

We now Went to my tent. Frank had built it out, and
it was large and full of things Frank had made, such as
chairs, stands, shelves, and two good beds. "7hen we sat
down Frank said he would tell me what hard work he had
with some of the men.

But first, I must tell you that when I left the isle, in the
ship with John 8., three of the men got 03', and went back
tothe isle to seek those that were left there. You know
that two of those on the isle were the worst ones in the
crew; and now these two went with those who came back,
and it was with these five had men Frank had such a hard
time. The rest were all right; they went to work to build
huts and raise grain, and would mind Frank in all things.

The rogues thought that the good men should keep
them and work for them, for they did not like to work,
and they did not want to llVE right, so the good men wbuldRamon (M6800. 67

not help them. This put the rogues in a mge, and they
swore they would fix them; but the good men took this as
a_ jest. One of the rogues said, "they will see if it is a

jest"; and one day when some of the' 00d men were of.
one of the rogues took up [large stic that; was on fire.
and put it to the side of one of the huts, and would have
set it on fire, but one of the men thrust it one side, or else
this hut with all the rest would have been burnt up. This
led to a great fight, and the good men drove the rogues
off to the north end of' the isle, near where the wild men
came for their feasts, and here they dug a sort of cave in
a piece of woods to sleep in at night, but would be up to
all sorts of bad deeds in the day time.

They would steal the corn, and pull up the stalks, run
off with the goats, and do all that they could to vex and
tease the good men. One day three of the good men went
down on the shore, and the rogues came at them and there
was a great fight, which, when the rest of the good men
heard, they came down to help their friends, and they took
the rogues to Frank; he took their arms from them, and
said, "lVliy do you act in this way?" They said they
could not live where they were. Frank told them if they
would do no more harm, but be still and try to work, the
good men would try to help them and they could live in
peace, but they could not have their arms.

For a while all went on in peace; the rogues would do
some work, but this did not last long; they grew bold,
and were soon at their old tricks once more. Frank
thought he would have to put them in a boat and send
them ofi' ; but a strange thing took place one night, which
made them tame For a long time. '

Frank had gone to bed in the tent, but he could not
sleep; his mind was ill at ease ; he said he felt as if there
was a great weight on his mind, and thought he should
hear some bad news. He thought that there might be a
plot with the rogues to kill the good men; so he woke up
the man who was with him. and told him how he felt, andI - ' - . .
. ' "(/3-- "J
After the' fight. the men went down to view the plane, and

they found a. score of dead men, and three who were hurt.
e-Page 69. - Robinson 0mm.
he said, " Say you 50'! I think we should go out, and
look round." This man went up to the top of the hill,
and came back with the word, that there was a great light
not far off, and he heard men shout and yell as if there was
a great fight. Frank then went and told the men, and
they all went up the hill to watch. There were three sets
of wild men, and they were all in a fierce fight. The men
thought they would like to go down, but Frank said they
must stay there, and he sent Jack down, to spy out why
they came. He took off his clothes so as to be like one
of them, and then went right down. He had been gone
an hour, when he came back and said that there were two
tribes, and that they were in a fierce fight, and would stay
there till the light of day.

Jack could scarce keep the men back. He told them
there were scores of the wild men, and that they could do
no good, but to let them fight it out; it would be the best
way to get rid of them.

They fought for three hours, and by this time it was
quite light, and then they got in the boats and went off.
The men went down to View the place, and they found
more than a score of dead men, and three who were hurt,
and these they took care of and kept them to work for
them.

When the rogues saw what work the wild men had
made, and the burnt bones that lay strewn all round, it
made them sick, and for some time they were quite mild,
and would do just as Frank bid them, as well as their

. share of the work.

One day one of the rogues got mad at one of the slaves,
and took up his ax to kill him, when one of the good men
went up to him, and told him to stop, which made the70 Rabi/neon awed.

but some of the rest of the good men came up to help
"' him, and then the rogues came to join their friend, and

ain, and clothes, with some tools to work with (for
_ t would not be right to let them starve), and sent
them 0 to one end of the isle. He told them if they
came near his men, to hurt them, to steal their flocks, or
to spoil or burn their oods, he would put them to death.

' tents, and set out some young trees, like those that were

They came to Frank and his men, and told them they
would like a boat and some food and clothes to take with
them. Frank's men were so glad to get rid of them, that
they gave them all these things, and some fire arms too,
for they told them the wild men would try to kill them,
and they must have some arms to keep them off. They

CHAPTER xvn.

BUT, in three weeks, they came back. They said they
went first to the main land, but the men that were there
would not let them come on shore; so they went on, till
they came to an isle which lay to the west of the main
land. Here they met with a kind race of men, who said,
" they did not eat men, nor fight if they could help it."
They went on shore, and gave the chief man some of the
things they had, and he made his men bring them food,
fish and fruit, and when they came ofl", they brought down
five girls and six men to take back as slaves.

They did not know what to do with then. all, but saw
that they must take them, or the chief might get mad,
and then he would hurt them; so they gave the chief an
ax, an old key and a knife, and he put them in their boat.

When Frank and his men heard this, they went down
to see the slaves, and found them all bound in one of the
huts. The poor things were full of fear when they saw the
men, for they thought they had come down to look at them,
that they might pick out the best ones to kill; so Frank
sent old Jack to tell them that they would not hurt them.

As Frank- and his friends did not want the girls with
them, the rogues said they would like to wed them; so
they drew lots for them and each took a wife. This was
a good thing for them all. The girls were true, smart and
clean, and as the men now had some one to care for, they
built huts and laid out farms, and in this way soon made
their part of the isle look like a small town.7 2 Robmm- C'msoa.

The bias]; men said they would work for the men, hm
as there was not much for them to do, and they did not
watch them, one day one of them ran off to the woods ~
They thought he was dead, but in a few weeks, when they
saw six boats full of black men come on shore, and go
right to the place where the men were, they knew that he
had gone home, and told his friends how and where to
find them.. -

The wild men went right to the woods, and when the
white ones went to catch them, they found they had set
on fire some of their huts, and they were all in flames.
This made them rage, and they laid a plan to shoot them
as they came out of the woods. So two of the white men
got up in the trunk of a large tree that stood on the edge
of the wood, and when they saw them, they took aim at
them through a hole in the tree, and as they came out, in
this way they shot near half a. score of them. The rest
now all ran out of the woods, and Frank and his men, who
had come up to help the white men, shot full two score
more. They then bound most of the rest, and put them
in their boats, and sent them back to their own land.

There were a few who had a. wish to stay with the white
men and be their slaves, so they kept them. The men
new went to look for their wives. They found them safe,
but near all their huts were burnt down. They soon built
these up, with the help of Frank's men. '

For six months they saw no more of the wild men.

But one day, just at dusk, some of the men saw a score
of small boats come up on the east side of the isle, full of
men, who had darts, bows, clubs'and swords. They were
a fierce set, and our men were full of fears, but they knew
they could not do much that night. They thought they
would make things as safe as they could. So they drove
their goats and flocks to the old cave, took up most all
their huts or tents, and sent their wives to my big tent, all
but two, who would not go; they said they could fight
with bows, which they did, and were a great help to the
men.

, Frank now took the men, and gave part of them to one
of the rogues whose name was Will, and he took the rest
in his charge. Will, though he had been a bad man, was
bold, and just. the one to head the men. They took all
the arms they had, and went up as near the wild men as
they could, and hid till the next morn.

When the sun was up quite high the wild men came in
crowds to where our men were, when at a Sign from Frank,
they shot at them right and left. The foe were so close,
that they fell dead all round, and those that the men did
not kill were hurt, and this put them in a great fright;
they flew to the woods as swift as they could, and here
they set up loud cries and shouts. Frank told his men to
let them be, for they would soon be so sore and stiff from
their Wounds, that it would not be a hard task to get the
best of them; so the men went down to the shore where
the boats lay, and they took some dry wood from a dead
tree and set most of their boats on fire. '

When the wild men saw this they were so mad that
they ran up and down the isle, and trod down the corn
and "tore up their vines and plants.

A great storm came up that night, and as the boats
were most all gone the wild men could not get off. Our
men had to watch them all that night; and at the break
of the next day, they found that a score of them were
dead in the woods, and the rest were sick and hurt; so
they sent old Jack to those that were left, and he told

' them that if they would give up to the white men they
would save their lives, and be kind to them, and that they
should live on a part of the isle, but that they must not
come near the white men, but keep in their own bounds.
This they were glad to do, and Frank gave them a place
way off on the south east end of the isle, and he gave them
corn to plant, and they soon learnt to make all kinds of
things with wood and cor , such as chairs, and stands, and
beds.

They were now down on the end of the isle where
Frank had put them, and the white men did not see them
for weeks at a time. And from that time, till I came to
the isle, they had not seen or heard of a wild man.

You must not think that Frank told me all this at once,
as I have told it to you. When we went out to walk, he
would show me the tents, and all that had been done and
built on the isle, and in this way I found out what I have
told you. I now saw why Frank had built the forts I
spoke of, to keep him and his friends safe from the bad
white men, and the wild men.

_ CHAPTER XVIII.

I HAD some long talks with Will and the rest of the
rogues. II'hey said they knew they had done wrong, but
that now they had wives and good homes, if I would help
them they would try and do right. I told them I would
do all I could for them.

One day I told all the men on the isle that they must
some and dine with me. I got the ship's cook and his
mate to come on shore to dress my meal. We brou ght on
shore six rounds of beef with four of pork, a punche bowl
full of beer, and ten flasks of' French wine. F 12ml; gave
us five whole kids to roast; we sent some of the flesh meat
in a close dish, to the men on the ship, as the} had not
had fresh meat for along While. We had 21;, gay time at
this feast, 11nd when we won: through, I took "- ill and his
men (101111 on board of the ship, and gave them some thin,
loose, light coats, some shuts, and socks, and shoes, and
some tools to work with, such as hoes,1akes, spades and
knives, as well as some a1ms. For these they gm e me
great thanks, and said that as I had done so much for
t'1e1n, they should bear in mind all I had said to them, and
that they would stay on the isle as long as I hid them,
and t1y at all times to do their best, and would li1e' 111
peace 111th all the men on the isle.

The young priest, who had gone all round the isle with
me and knew all Frank had told me, said to me one day,
that he would like to stay on the isle, and he thong ht the'
young men and the young girl 11110 were on the ship 11- ould
like to do the same, as they could do a great deal of good
to these poor men and their 11 was He thought that he
ought to preach the word of God to them, for the
most of them would, no- doubt, have to end their claws
here.

I was glad to hear him say this, and told him Ithomh'r
it was a good plan. . I went to the ship and brought the
young; folks on shore, and with them a young man, that
we gave the name of Jaek--of-- all--trades to, as he could do
all sorts of' things, and was of so much use to us on the
ship. I found in my room five or six books of God's
Word, and all but one of these I gave to the priest, and
that one I gave to Will, and told him I would like him to
read it night and morn, which he said he w0uld do.

One day the young man came to me and said with a
shy look, that as we had a priest, there were two young
folks that would like to wed. I thought it was the maid
and this young man; so I told him to think well of it, for
the maid had not been brought up as he had, and was not
of the same rank with him, and that at some time he
might feel bad, and wish to get rid of her; but he said
with a smile, he was not the man, it was the maid and
Jaek-of-all--trades. I told him I was glad of this, for I
thought Jack was a smart, trueman, and the maid a good
girl, and she could do a great deal to help and teach the
rest of the poor girls on the isle.

The priest said he had one thing to ask of me, and that

; ,. was, that he might keep Friday with him, as he could do

so much to help him learn the speech of the black men
that were there, and could teach them to know and pray
to God as he did.

I told the priest that I felt what he said was true, but
that Friday had been so long with me, and' was so true
to me, that I could not part with him; and I told him
once he should not leave me, and that if I did not take
him with me now, he would think I was false to him, and
he w0u1d die of grief.

I had now been here for a. month, and as all the men
were at peace, I thought I would go back to the ship, and
sail round and see some more of the world.

My mind was in such a state, in fact had been so all
my life, that I could not rest long in a place. So true
it is that what is "born.in the bones can not be beatBowman 05mm 77

out of- the flesh." I sent for the men to come and talk
with me once more, and gave them each a piece of land,
and quite a large farm to Jack-of--all--trades, and I told
them they must try and live in peace and learn to love
the Lord, and do all they could that was right, and when

 

FAREWELL DH".

1 got home I would send them some stock, such as cows,
pigs, and sheep, as well as some goods fior clothes. I then
bid them all good bye, and set; sail.

It Was the sixth of May, a. clear bright day, we shot
off five guns and the men on the shore did the same, and
we were soon out of sight.

When we had been out to sea-three days, the mate
came to me and said, "Sir, do you see that fleet?" 1
tool; cut my glass, and saw that there were scores of
small bOats full of wild men. The men in the ship were
full oi" fear, and I must say that I felt there were so few
of us, that they might do us a great deal of harm, but
I told the men to take their arms and to fix them, then
to get out the small boats and man them, and to furl all
the sails, and we would lay by and wait for them to come,
and we could fire on them. I thought they might. try to
fire our ship, so I told the men not to let them come too
near.

They came quite fast, and in a short time were quite
close to us. I told Friday to go on deck and call to
them, and ask them what they meant. He did so, but as
soon as they heard him speak, they took aim at him.
Friday said with a loud voice, " They will shoot," and
just then they sent out full three score darts; three of
them struck poor Friday, and he fell dead.

When I saw poor Friday fall, I was so mad and full of
rage, that I told my men to load four guns with large shot
and five Witl- small, and to, give them such a blast of fire
as they had not seen or heard in their lives. I can not
tell how they were hurt; we knew. that we had shot some
of them, for we saw them sink, and most of their boats
were split or sunk; but they did not seem to mind this,
for they were in such a great fright and haste to get off,
that those who could swim did so, and the rest took the
good boats and went off as fast as they could, and in less
than three hours we could not see a sign of them.Won 07mm. 79

There was one poor man who could not swim, so our
men took him on the ship. He was hurt and could not
speak for some time, and for a long while he did not want
to eat; but we taught him a few words of our own tongue,
and then he told us, that the day we saw the wild men,
there were five tribes, and they were out with their kings
to have a great fight, and that when his king saw our
ship, he said they must come up to it and fight there, so
as to let us see them, for they thought it would be a
grand sight, but the noise and fire from our guns were so
great, that it gave them Such a fright, they were glad to
get out of our way as quick as they could.

Poor Friday! [must now take my last leave of him.
My heart was sad and full of grief when I thought of his
love, how true and kind he had been, and now he was
gone, and how I should miss him.

CHAPTER XIX.

I HAD a box made, and we put him in it, and let him
down in the sea, and the men shot off ten guhs as he
went down. . -

We now went on our way. We .had fair winds and a
smooth sea, and in two weeks we came to All'Saiuts Bay.
Here I had a sloop made, on which I put a crew of eight
men with their wives. I bought a large stock of goods
and tools, and these, with three cows, five calves, a score
of hogs, two sheep, a. horse and two mares, I put on board
the sloop, and sent them all to my friends on the isle, as
I had told them I would do when I left them. I told the
mate how to go there, and I heard that the sloop and all
on board went there safe and sound, and the things were
such a great help to them, that in a. few years I would not
have known the old isle.

And now I shall take leave of my isle. I had done all
i eould for those that were there, and if they did not want
to stay they could go where they had a. wish to, for they
had the sloop and some small boats, as well as the large
boat Friday and I had made; but, as I have said, I heard
that all went well with them, and I thank God that I
have had the chance to do some good in my life.

We went from All Saints Day to the Cape of Good
Hope. We did not stay here long. There did not seem
to be much to be done or seen here; so we laid in a stock
of some things we were in need of, and went to a large
isle, which lies north east of the Cape. We put our ship
in port, on the east side of the isle, and I, with some of
the men, got in a small boat and went on shore. We saw
that the folks who dwelt here were kind, and we thought
we could do well here.

The men came down .to look at us, and when we saw
them, we out three houghs from a. tree, and stuck each of
them at just such .a. space, and they did the same, for this,
was a mark with them: of a sort of truce, and that we
could: trade with them,"but we must not pass their poles
or sticks, nor take our arms with us, and they must do the
same, and we must all buy and sell by these sticks. They
brought us milk, roots, fish and meat, and were glad .to
take knives and such small things as we had to give them.

The first night we were here, some of the men thought
they would stay on shore all night; so the made a small
hut to sleep in, and I went with a, man an a boy in the
boat. At two o'clock the next mom I heard one of the
men on shore call for help, and then I heard a gun. I
woke up the man who was with me (and told the .boy to
watch the boat), and we took all the arms we had with us
and went on shore to help them.

There were but nine of us and there were Scores of the
toe; they sent their darts at us, and we shot off our guns;
we knew that we had hurt some of them from the cries
we heard, but it was too dark for us to see well. Our
men came in the boat, and we put up boards and chests
and stood back of them, and then we made signs to the
ship to come to us, and the man in charge brought her up,
and we all kept watch till it was light, when the men
from the ship came on shore and we sent them such a
fierce fire, from our large and small guns, that they fled to
the woods in a. short time.

We found the cause of the fight to be the fault of one of
our men; he had said some rude things to one of the girls
who came to bring them milk, which she did not like, and
she told some of her friends, and they all came down to
beat him for it. This man's name was Tom; he was not
to be found with our men, and though we kept on the
look out for him for two days, he did not come, and we
made up our mind that he was dead.

'Some of the men said they would go and look for him,
but this I did not want them to do. I told them they
might share the fate that Tom had, but they would not
heed, and eight of them went ofl', while the rest went on,
the ship, and I took two men and a boy and went to the
boat.

When our man went ofl" ' they did not mean to harm
their foes, but see if they could find Tom, and at the
same time look for gold. They went on for a mile and
saw 110 one, and thought they must have gone the wrong
way, when they saw a cow by a tree, and then they knew
that some one must live near, and in 11 short time, they
came to :1 small town, and the first sight here that met,
their eyes w as poor Tom. They had hung him to a tree
by one a1m,and then cut his th1oat.

This made them so mad, that they swo1e they would
kill all then fees and file the town. The huts 11 ere all
small but one, and most of the foe 11 010 in the huge one.
, 0111 men went to 11011: as still as they could, and 111 it
shut time the huge house and some of the 11111111 huts
11-e1e in a. blaze. This made the foe 11m out on all sides
with shmp yells of flight, and 0111 men shot them as if
they 11010 111ad (loos.

\Ve heard the noise and saw the light, and I said to the

us and one 0le them said,- " I am so glad you have come,
but we we not halt done yet."

At this, I said, with a loud voice, " W retch! what are
you at? What does this mean? If you do not stop,']

' XVhy, sir,' 'said he, "it you gwant to know why we have

itold him that Tom had done wrong, and the black
men were not to blame; that he would do the same
if he had the same cause; but this did no good, and when
the rest of the men came up, and saw Tom, they were:
just as bad. They said this man was right, and they
would kill all the men they could find.

As I could not stop them, I went off; and the thought
of that day's work made me sad for a long time, for I felt
that God's wrath must be on. our men.

The next day we set sail, and for a few weeks all went"
well. One day we had to stop at a small town on the
coast to get some food, and I thought I would go
on shore'and look round to see what kind of a place it
was.

While I was gone the men on the ship had a talk, and
they told the men in charge that I must not come back on
the ship, for they were mad at what I said to them on the
isle. They said I had no right to scold them, and they
did not like me, and that he must leave me on shore. He
told them that he could not do this; that I had a large
share in the ship, and he must take me with him. But
they would not hear a word of this; they said they would
" one and all " leave the ship, and he could run the boat.
So he had to come on shore to me, and when he told me
all they had said, I thought, for his sake, I would stay,
for if these men left him, I did not see where he was to
get a crew from, so I told him to send me all the things
that were in my room on the ship, and to send me some
gold as soon as he could.

The next morn he sent me my goods, and with them
his own man to wait on me. And now, once mate, I was
left in a strange land. But "I found the men here werekind, and full of will, and that shifif came by two or
S

three times a wee ; there were some f0 here from my
own land, and with one of these I got good board for me
and my man.

CHAPTER XX.

[WAS in this place nine months, and made some warm
friends. ' I bought some fine gems, and some drugs, as well
as some goods which I thought would be good to trade.

There was a. man in the same house with me, and he
thought that if we were to hire a ship, and take our goods
to a land that was not far off, we could do well, for, said
he, " Why should we stand still here? There are no
drones in the world but men, and why should we be of
that class? "

It took us some time to get a. ship to our minds, and we
had hard work to pick up a crew, but we found some
Dutch men who said they would go; we put all our goods
on board, and set sail.

On our way out, we found the ship was an old and poor
one, and that we should have to stop and fix it; so we put
in port at a large place, and I told the mate, as we would
have to wait for a few days, I would go on shore and see
if I could find some goods we could take with us.

I found here some ships and men from my own land,
and some from the East. I saw, too, there were some fine
goods and fruits which I knew would be of great use to
us, and I thought I would lay in a large stock, so went
each day to buy some.

One day the man of whom I had bought most of my
goods, said to me, "I think it would be best for you to
leave here as soon as you can, for there are some men
here who say they will burn your ship and hang you."
"Hang me! what for?" "Well, they have heard some
strange things, and I thought I would tell you, and warn
y0u in time."

For a long while I could not speak; for I did not know
how' they could hear of me, as this was the first time in
my life I had been there, but I ave him my thanks and
went right on board the ship, an told the mate what I had
heard; and he said he thought the ship was all right now,
and we could set sail that day.

There was quite a strong breeze, and it was not long
when we were some way out to sea, and by night we
thought we were out of their reach, but the next mom I
was down in one of the rooms of the ship, when one of
the men put his head in the door and said, there were five
boats full of men in full chase for us.

I went up and saw the mate, and we brought all the
men up on deck, and told them we thought these men
meant to seize our ship and take and hang us all. I said
to them, " Will you stand by us '9" and they all said they
would live or die with us. Our mate said he thought the
best way was to keep them off with our great shot as long
as we could, and then to fire on them with our small arms,
and we must try to keep them down off the deck of the
ship.

When they were most up to us, we hung out a white
flag, but, as they would not heed this, we took it in and
hung out a red one, to show them we would fight for our
lives, and then we sent them such a good round of great
shot that they kept ofi' for some time, and when they cameRobinson Unsure. 8'?

up once more, we sent such a blast of fire from five of our
great guns, that it took ofi the stern of one of their boats,
so that it soon sank; and the men who had charge of our
guns kept up the fire for a. long while, which hurt them
and their boats so much they were glad to give up and let
us go.

There were two men who were hurt so that they could
not swim, and they were in the sea so close to our ship that
we took them in. One of these men was a Dutch man,
and he told us the cause of all this was that the man of
whom we had bought the ship was in port with us, and he
had told the men there we were a bad set of men; that
we went up and down on the sea to rob ships, and that
we had stole the ship we had. This made them so mad
they made up their minds to come and take us and the

' ship to the land, and hang us all, and not wait to hear the
truth.

We could not make out what this meant, but when we
came to ask more of this man, we found the man we had
bought our ship from was a thief, and that he was on

' board of the ship with this Dutch man, and that he would
not mind the men in charge of the ship, and one day he
'got mad and shot the head man, and got some more of _
the men to join him, and they ran off with the ship, and
p took it to the place where we first saw him, and sold it to
us, and in some way he came to this last place, and when
he saw, us he thought he might be found out, so had told
this, a lie, to the men, and then said to this Dutch man if
he told the truth he would kill him; but we had been so
' brave that they could not stand our fire arms, and so had

left us.
All went on well for some days, when we found that
our ship had sprung a leak, way down on one side. We '
did not know what to do. We must fix it, or it Would go
down; and we did not want to go on shore, for we did not
know what foe we might meet.

I told the men to let down our small boat, and all that
could must get in, While the rest took in the sails of the
ship; and they took all the things of great weight and
put them in on one side, and then lay her up as high '
as they could on the beach; and when they had made a
sort of stage to stand on, they went to work to stop up
the leak and to tar the side of the ship. There were five of
us in the small- boat, and the rest of the men were at Work
on the side of the ship, and we were but a short way from
the land.

The men who dwelt there did not know what to make
of our ship, and as they saw just a few men they thought
it would be a good chance to come down and take our
goods; and what few men they saw, they could make
slaves of, or sell to their king; so they got out some small
boats, and put eight or ten men in each, and they came up
to where we were.

When I saw what they meant to do, I told the men to
let the stage slip down in the sea, and we all went up on
deck as soon as we could _; and when they came quite close
to us, two or three of them thought they would try and
climb up the side of the ship. One of our men stood near
the hot pitch pot, and he took up a great spoon full, and
threw it on them, which soon sent them down with a cry
of pain. "Well done, Jack," said one of the men,"g1ve
them some more," which he did, for he took up the Spoon
and sent out the hot stufi to the right and left, omen
sides.- 31W

This they could not stand long, for they went off with
cries and howls of pain, which we heard for some time.

We then went on with our work, and, in a day or so,
the ship was all right, and we went on our way. We did
not stop, but went straight north, and in less than a. month
we came to the land (as those who live there call it) of the
Sun.

We went from port to port; in one place we would sell
our goods, and in the next we would buy more. I thought
I would like to see more of this land, than I could do in a
ship; so when we came to the port of one of their large
towns. we sold our ship and took our goods, and went on
shore. Here we met some men who were on their way- to
the chief town in the land, where there was to be a great
fair, and they said they would like us to join them.

One of the men was :1 Scot, he had been here for a long
time, and knew all their ways, and. he said he could show
us the land and how to trade with the men. We said we
would join them, and made the Scot our head or chief ; we
gave him part of our geld and told him to pay our bills,
and to lead us at all times. We thought it best to take a
guide too, and we soon found that we had need of both
head and guide.

I must tell you of the queer men who dwelt in this land.
The}r were light and wore long loose coat-s like a blouse,

. shoes that were made of wood ; their hair, which was
black, hung in long braids down their backs; they were
smart, and made lots of fine good}, like fans, shawls, silks,
and dress goods. They did not know the true God, but
had gods of their own, which they made of wood and stone,
and they would take these gods with them from place to
place. '
One day we saw one on the ground; it was quite large
and had horns; the sight of it made me sad, and I felt that
I must tell them of our Lord. Our chief said they would
not heed me; that they did not like strange men to go
through their land, much less to talk of their gods, and
they might get mad at me, and kill us all. But I still clung
to the thought, and the more I saw of these things the
more pain I felt, and I though , "how I would like to burn
up all these gods." In one place we met a priest who had
been there for some time, and I had a long talk with him.
He said my zeal was all right, but it would do no good for
me to treat their gods in this way or to say much to them;
most of the men could not read or write, and that theyr
would not know what we meant; the}r would not like it,
and, as my chief had said, would drive us all out. We
must leave them to those who could be sent from our own
land to teach them; it would be slow work, for they must
be made to feel and know that they were friends, and did
not mean to harm them ; we must pray for them and leave
the rest to God. I saw he was right, and we weutlon; but
I made up my mind that I would do all I could when I got
home to send them help.

One day we came to a large town, and we thought we
would stay here for a day or two; we found the chief Work
of the men here was to make a fine kind of: ware, out of a
sort of clay, which they have a great deal of; in fact, we
did not see much else but pots, pans, cups, jars, and such
like things. Our guide said he would like to show us a
house all built of this kind of ware.

I told him I would like to have it to take home with me,
for I thought he meant a toy house. "Take it home!" he

said with scorn, " Why, there are near two score men in it."
When I came to it I found that it was a large house built
of lathe, and this were put on them like tiles. The walls
and floors were make of these tiles; some were blue and
white, some were green, and some of a dark gray hue,
There were ponds with gold fish in, and the walks in the
y'u'ds were all made in this same odd way.

Our guide did naught but brag of all the great things
they could do; and when we came to the Great Wall, which
is built for miles and miles round, he said to me, "What do
you think of that?" I told him it might do to keep out
the men they stood in fear of, but if some of the men in
my land were to come with their strong fire arms, they
would knock it down in a short time. When he heard this
he was mute for a long while, and he did not say much
more of the might of his men.

We now went to the chief town in the land, and it was
full of men from all parts of the land, who had come with
their goods to the great fair there. We bought a lot of
fans, shawls, silks, and small toys and tea. Most of these
I sent home to my friend, who sent me back a large sum
of gold for them.

One day our chief told. us there was to be a great hunt
that day, and he thought we would like to go. I said to
him, "What kind of la. hunt?" He said, "A sheep hunt."
This made us all laugh. The sheep are shy, but wild, and
though swift, they will not run far, and as they keep close
you are sure to get some.

While we were out we saw two score of those wild hordes
who roam from place to place, to rob or kill all whom they
may meet; and though they have no skill to fight, they do
a great deal of harm.

When they saw us they blew a kind of horn quite loud.Crusoe's days must now be few, for he had seen more than
tbrccscorc and Len years, and it - ~ras Lime to think of that world of
peace and lava--Page 96.

Robinson Onume.
This we knew was to call some of their friends, and in a
short time a score more came up.

One of our men said this was not the first time he had
seen them, and he knew just how to deal with them. He
told us we had no time to lose, and that we must form a
line, and all fire at once when he gave the word. We did
as he told us, and they let fly their darts, but none of us
were hurt ; there were five of them shot, and the rest fled,
and we saw no more of them.

We went on for a month more, through the rest of this
strange land, and saw much that was new as well as queer
to us.

As we had seen all we had a wish to in this land, we
thought we would go to the North Sea, and in five months
we were in a large town near the coast, but the snow was
so great and it was so cold that I did not care to stay here
long; so I Went a few miles south.

I found this land to be the place Where they send the
men who do not like or mind the Czar (as they call their
king), and here I met some men of high rank, and a prince,
who had been sent here, as they could not make up their
minds to think and do all that the Czar would ask them
to. The prince was a fine man, full of good deeds and
thoughts.

I told these men my life on the isle, and of the men I
had left there. They said they thought it a great and
strange case, but that I had great cause for joy ; I was lord
of all while I was there, and could do as I had a wish, and
that my men must love me, as I had shown them so much
thought and care, which was more than the Czar had done
for them. I could not keep the prince and his sad lot out
of my mind, and I thought I would like to have him go
to my own land with me. I said to him one day, " I have
been here a. long time, and think I ought to go home; how
would you like to go with me, if you could get off?" At
first, he did not want me to talk to him of it, but when he
had thought of it for a while, he said that he did not think
he ought to go in that way, but if I would like to serve or
aid him, I could take with me one that was near and dear
to him, and that was his son. He did not like to see him
kept here; as he had done no wrong; he had been sent
with him when a child, and had grown up here.

The next day he sent for his son, who had been for some
months with some friends not a. great way off. When I
saw the young man my heart went right out to him, he
was so like the prince, full of love and kind thoughts for
all.

He did not want to leave the prince, but we made him
see it was for his own good, and that he might do more for
the prince if he went with me, than he could do there.

The piince gave me a fine lot of skins and furs, and I
gave him some of the goods I had brought with me, and' in
a month we left the place.

We went through two or three new lands, and' 1n one of
them the young lord found some friends who said they
could help the prince, if the young man would go to their
court with them. Though I was 10th to part with him, I
felt it would not be right for me to keep him; so I bade
him "good bye," and then went straight to my place of
birth.

I got back to my old home the first of the year 1705.
And now I made up my mind to stay here.

I had seen near all this world. God had been good to me
through all. I had no one to blame for the ills of my life;
I had brought them on by my self will. My days must
now be few, for I had seen more than three score and ten
years, and it was time for me to think of that world of
peace and love where I soon must go.

My book of God's Word, that I found on the ship, I had
kept close by me through all these years; and now With'
that for my gmfide, I will wait God's good time to cross that
sea, to the shore where all are at rest. And while I had-to
wait, I thought I would write this book, 1.0 Show you, first,
that if you would have joy and peace in this world, you
must mind God's fifth law, and next, that in all the ills and
cares of life. you must seek God, learn to love and trust
Him, and he will bring you safe home at last.
