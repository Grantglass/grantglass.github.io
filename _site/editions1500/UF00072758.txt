1826.THE
LIFE AND ADVEir-TURES

OF

ROBINSON CRUSOE.

I WAS born at York, in the year 1632, of a
reputable family. My father was a native of
Bremen, who, by merchandizing at Hull for
some time, gained a very plentiful fortune.
He married. my mother at York, who received,
her first breath in that country: and as her
maiden name was Robinson, I was called
113052323072 Kreulznaer, which not being easily
pronounced in the English tongue, we are com-
monly known by the name of Crusoe.

I was the youngest of three brothers. The
eldest was a IieutenanLcolonel in Lockhart's
regiment, but slain by the Spaniards :' what
became of the other I could never learn. '

No charge nor pains were wanting in my
education, My father designed me for the
13W. yet nothing could serve me but I must go
to sea, Both against the will of my father, the;6

"tears of my mother, and the intreaties of my
friem s. One morning, my father expostulated
very warmly with me. What reason, says he,
have you to leave your native country, where
there must be a more certain prospect of con-
tent and happiness, to enter into awandering
condition of uneasiness and uncertainty ? He
recommended to me Agur's wish, Neil/zer to
desire poverty, nor mic/36:; that a middle state
of life was the most happy; and that the high
towering thoughts of raising our condition by
wandering abroad, were surrounded with mi-
sery and danger, and often ended with confu-
sion and disappointment. I entreat you, nay,
I command you, (says he,) to desist from these
intentions. If you will go, (added he) my
prayers shall however be offered for your pre-
servation; but a time may come, when deso-
late, oppressed, or forsaken, you may wish
you had taken your poor despised father's
counsel. He pronounced those words with
such a moving and paternal eloquence, while
floods of tears ran down his aged cheeks, that
it seemed to stem the torrent of my resolutions.
But this soon wore off, and _a little after, I in-
formed my mother that I could not settle at
any business, my resolution was so strong to
see the world, and begged she would gain my
father's consent only to go one voyage; which
if it did not prove prosperous, I would never
attempt a second. But my desire was as vain
as my folly in asking. My mother passionately

expressed her dislike of this proposal, telling7\

me, T/mt as size saw I was bent on my own
- destruction, contrary to (Iceerwz'll and my (lady,
size would say no more, but have me to myself,
to do whatsoever I pleased.

I was then, 'I think. nineteen years old,
when one time being at Hull, I met. a. school-
fellow Of mine going along with his father, who
was master of a ship, to London, and acquaint-
ing him with my wandering desires, he assured
me of a free passage, and a plentiful share of
what was necessary. Thus, without imploring
a blessing, or taking afarewel of my parents, I
took shipping on the first of September 1651.

Upon the sixth day we came to an anchor in
Harwich road, Where we lay wind-bound with
some Newcastle ships; and there beinga good
anchorage, and Our cables sound, the seamen
forget their late toil and danger, and spent.
the time as merrily as if they had been on
shore. But on the eighth day, there arose a
brisk gale of wind, which prevented our
tidingit up the river; and it still increasing,
our ship rode forecastle in, and shipped se--
serial-large seas.

It was not long before horror seized the
seamen themselves, and Iheard the master
express this melancholy ejaculation, Lord Izave
mercy upon us, we sfiall be all lost and undone .'
For my part, sick unto death, I kept my cabin,
till the universal and terribly dreadful appre.
' hensions of our speedy fate made me get upon
deck, and there I was affrighted indeed. The
sea went mountains high: '1 could see nothing8

but distress around us; two shipshad cut away
their masts, and another had foundered: two
more that had lost their anchors, were forced
out to the mercy of the ocean: and, to save
our lives, We were forced to cut our foremast
and mainmast quite away. ~

Who is there so ignorant as not to judge of
my dreadful condition? I was but a fresh
water sailor, and therefore seemed more ter-
rified. Our ship was very good, but over-
loaded; which made the sailors often cry out,
Sfie will founder : words I then was ignorant
of. All this while, the storm continuing, and
rather increasing, the master and the more
sober part of the men went to prayers, ex-
pecting death every. moment. In the middle
of the night, one cried out, W'e dad sprung a
Zea/r.- another, T/zat t/zere was four feet wafer
2'22 t/ze fiold. I was just ready to expire with
fear, when immediately all hands were called
to the pump: and the men forced me also in
that extremity to share with them in their la.
hour. While thus employed, the master espy-
ing some colliers, fired a gun as a signal of dis-
tress; and I not understanding what it meant,
and thinking that either the ship was wrecked,-
or some dreadful thing had happened, fell into
a swoon. Even in that condition of We, nobody
minded me, excepting to thrust me aside with
their feet, thinking me dead ; and I was a great .
while before I recovered. -

Happy it was for us, when, upon the signal
given, they ventured out their boat to save our9

lives. All our pumping had been in vain, and
vain had all our other efforts been, had they not
come to our ship's side, and our men cast
them a rope over the stem with a buoy to it,
which after great difficulty they caught hold of,
and we hauling them to us got into their boat,
and left our ship, which we perceived sink
within less than a quarter of an hour: and
thus I learned what was meantbyfozmderz'ng
at sea. And now the men incessantly la-
boured to recover their own ship; but the
sea ran so high, and the wind blew so hard,
that they thought it convenient to haul in
shore, which with great difficulty and danger
at last we happily efl'ected, landing at a place
called Cromer, not far ,from \Vinterton light-
house; from whence we all walked to Yar-
mouth, where, as objects of pity, many good
people furnished us with the necessaries to carry
us either to Hull or London. '
Strange! that after all this, I did not, like
the prodigal son, return to my father: who,
hearing of the ship's calamity. for a long time
thought me entombed in the deep. No doubt
but I should have s/zared 2'22 fiz'sfatted my; as
the Scripture ' expresseth it: but my wayward
disP osition still pushed me on, in spite of the
powerful convictions of 'reason and conscience.
When We had been at Yarmouth three days,
I met my old companion who had given me
the invitation to go on board along with his
"father. His behaviour and speech'were altered,1'0

and, in a1ne'lancl1oly manner he asked me howI

'be langl'ied at by my neighbours and acquaint-
'ances. 'So strange is the nature of youth, who
are not ashamed to sin, but yet ashamed to re-
~pent; and so far from being ashamed of those
actions for which they may be accounted tools,
they think it fol] y to return to their duty, which
'is the principal mark of wisdom. In short, I
travelled up to Lender], resolving upon a
voyage; and a voyage I soon heard of, by my
acquaintance with a captain who took a fame;
to me, to go to the coast of Guinea. Having;
some money, and appearing like a gentleman,
'I went on hoardfnot as a common suitor or
to1degcu1ast~man; nay, the commander agreed 1
should go that voyage with him without any
'expense; that I should he his messinute and.
companion, and that I was welcome to carry
any thing with me, and make the best mu;-
chandise I could, , .

1 blessed my happy famine, sue humbly
thanked the captain for his offer, and acquaint-
ing my friends in Yorkshire, forty pounds were
sent me, the greatest part of which, my (Ix-34'
'father and mother contributed, with which I
"bought toys and trifles, as the captain digrectea
me. My caytain also taught me navigation,
so that I soon knew how to keep'an account
of the ship's coiiise, and to take an observa-
tion, and also became acquainted with seyeraluse-

_ fui branches ofthe mathematics. And indeed this '-
Yoyage made me both a sailor'and. a merchant;
"for I brought "home five pounds nine ounces,
"Trey weight, cf gold dustflbr my adieu titre. '12

which produced, at my return to London. al-
most three hundred pounds ; but in this voyage
I was extremely sick, being thrown into a very
violent fever through excessive heat, trading
upon the coast from the latitude of fifteen de-
grees north, even to the line itself.

But, alas! my dear friend the captain de-
parted this life soon after his arrival. This was
a sensible grief to me; yet I resolved to go
another voyage with his mate, who had now
got command of the ship. This roved a
very unsuccessful one; for though did not
carry a hundred pounds of my late acquired
wealth, (so that I had two hundred pounds
left, which I reposed with the Captain's widow,
who was an honest gentlewoman,) yet my mis-
fortunes in this voyage were very great. For
our ship sailing towards the Canary Islands,
we were chased by a Salee rover; and in s ite
of all the haste we could make, by crow ing
as much canvas as our yards could Spread, or
our masts carry, the pirate gained upon us,
so that we prepared ourselves to fight. They
had eighteen guns, and we had but twelve.
About three in the afternoon, there was a 'des.
perate engagement, wherein many were killed
and wounded on both sides: but finding our-
selves overpowered with numbers, our ship
disabled, and ourselves too impotent to have
the least hopes of success, we were forced 'to
surrender; and accordingly we were all carried
prisoners into the port of Salee. Our men
were sent to the Emperor's court to be sold13

there; but the pirate captain taking notice of
me, kept me to be his own slave.

In this condition, I thought myself the most
miserable creature on earth, and the warning
of my father came afresh into my thoughts.
However, my condition was better than I
thought it to be, as will soon appear. Some
hopes, indeed, I had that my new patron would
go to sea again, where he might be taken by a.
Spanish or Portuguese man of war, and then
I should he set at liberty. But in this I was
mistaken; for he never took me with him, but
left me to look after his little garden, and do
the drudgery of his house, and when he re-
turned from sea, would make me lie in the
cabin, and look after the ship. I had no one
that I could communicate my thoughts to,
which were continually meditating my escape,
No Englishman, Irishman, or Scotchman, in
short, no Briton amongst his slaves but myself;
and for two years I could see nothing practica-
ble, but only pleased myself with devising
plans which I_ was always obliged to relinquish.

After some length of time, my patron. as I
found, grew so poor, that he could not fit out
his ship as usual; and then he used constantly
once or twice a week, if the weather was fair, ,
to go out a fishing, taking me and a young
Moorish boy to row the boat; and so much
pleased was he with me for my dexterity in
catching the fish, that he would often send me
with'a Moor, who was one of hiskinsmen, and
the youth heforefmentiOned, to catchy. dish of .
fish for him. " --1-!

(3110 morning, as we'were fishing, there
arose such a thick fog, that we lost sight of the
Shore; and rowing, we knew not which way,
we laboured all the night, and in the morning
we found eumelves in the ocean, two leagues
from land. However, we attained there at
length, and made the greatest haste, because
our tJestomachs were exceedingly sharp and hun-
gry. In 0111131 to prevent such disasters for
the future, my pat1on ordered a carpenter to
build a little state-room or cabin in the middle
of the long boat, with a place behind it to
steer and haul home the main sheet, with other
conveniencies to keep him from the weather, as
also lockers to put, in all manner of proxisions ;
with a handsome shoulder- of-- mutton sail, gibing
ever the cabin.

In this, he frequently took us out a fishing;
and one time, inviting two or three persons of
distinction to go with him, laid 1n provisions
extraordinary: providing also three fusees,
with powder and shot, that they might kill
some sea fowl along the coast. The next
morning, the boat was made clean, her ancients
and pendants out, and every thing ready: but
their minds alte1ing, my patron ordered us to
go a- fishing, for that his uestsg would certainly
sup with him that night.

And now I began to think of my deliverance
indeed. 111 order to this, I persuaded the
Moor to get seme provisions en. boaid, and'to'
procure some powder and Shet, pretending to

.Isili sea- -curiews, which he innocently and tea.15

(lily agreed to. In short, being provided with

all-things necessary, we sailed out.

NVhen we had passed the castle, we fell to
afishing; but thoughI knew there was a bite,I
dissembled the matter, in order to put farther
out to sea. Accordingly we ran a league far-
ther, When, giving the boy the helm, and pro-
tending to stoop for something. I seized Muley
by surprise, and threw him overboard. As
he was an excellent swimmer, he soon arose,
and made towards the boat; upon which I
took out a fusee, and presented it at him:
" Muley," said I, " I never yet designed to
" do you any harm, and seek nothing new but
" my freedom. I know you are able enough
" to swim-to shore, and save your life; but if
"'- you are resolved to follow me to the eh-
" dangering of mine, the very moment you
" proceed, I will shoot you through the head."
The harmless creature, at these words, turned
himself from me, and, I make no doubt, got
Safe to land. Then turning to *the boy Xury,
I perceived he trembled at the action; but I
put him out of all fear, telling him, that if
he would be true and faithful to me,,~1 would
do well by him, and not hurt him.

We then pursued our voyage, I kept to the
southward, to the truly Barbarian coast; but
in the dark of the evening I changed my course,
that I might keep near the shore; and having
a fresh gale of wind, with a very pleasant
smooth sea, by three o'clock next day, I was
150-rmil'es' beyond the Emperor of Morocco's16

dominions. I continued sailing for five days
successively, till such time as the wind shifting
to the southward, made me conclude that i
any vessel was in chace of me, they would
proceed no further.

After so much fatigue and thought, I an-
chored at the mouth of a little river, I knew
not'what, or where, neither did I then see any
people. What I principally wanted was fresh
water; and I was resolved about the dusk of
the evening to swim ashore: but no sooner
did the gloomy clouds of night begin to sue-
ceed the declining day, than we heard such
barking, roaring, and howling of wild crea-
tures, that one might have thought the very
strongest monsters of nature had their residence
there. Poor Xury, who was almost dead with
fear, entreated me not to go on shore that night.
5' Suppose I don't, Xury," said I, " and in the
" morning we should. see men who are worse
" than those we fear, what then?" "'0 den
" we may give dem de shoot gun," said he,
" laughing, "and de gun make dem all run
" away." The wit, and broken English which
the boy had learned from myself, for we had
passed a great deal of our time together,
pleased me entirely, and made me still fender
of him than before. We could get but little
sleep all the night for the terrible howlings they
made; and indeed we were very much afi'righted.

' The next morning, I was resolved to goon
shore to get in fresh water, and ventured my-
self among the beasts or savages, should eitherI7 \

attack me. Xu'ty said he would take one of the
jars, and bring me some. I asked him why he
would go and not I ? The poor boy answered,
" If wild mans come, they eat me, you go
" away." This, indeed increased my afl'ec.
tion for the child. " \Vell, dear Xury," said I,
" we will both go ashore, both kill wild mans,
" and they shall eat neither of us." So giving
Xury a piece of bread to eat, we waded ashore,
carrying nothing with us but our arms, and two
jars for water. I did not go out of sight of the
boat, as dreading the savages coming down the
river in their canoes : but the boy seeing a low
descent or vale about a mile in the country, he
wandered to it; and then running back to me,
With great precipitation, I thought he was put-
sued by some savages or wild beasts; upon' -
which I approached, resolving to perish, or pro-
tect him from danger. As he came nearer'to
me, I saw something hanging over his shoul.
ders, which was a creature he had shot like a
hare, but different in colour, and with longer
legs; however, we were glad of it, for it proved
Wholesome and nourishing meat ; but what
added to our joy was, my boy assured me
there was plenty of'water. and that he " saw
" no Wild mans." And greater'still was our
comfort, when We found fresh water in the
creek where we were, when the tide was out,
without going so far up into the country.

In this place I'began to hope that I' should
meet some of the English trading vessels, who

i w'ould relieve and take .us in.18

The place I was in was, no doubt, that wild
country. inhabited Only by a few, that lies
between the'Emperor of Moroeco's dominion.-
.and the negroes. It is filled with Wild beasts,
and the Moors use it for hunting chiefly.--
.li'i'om this place, I thought I saw the top of the
mountain Teneril'f'e, in the Canaries, which
made me try twice to attain it, but as often
was I driven back, and-so forced to pursue my
fortune along shore.

Early one morning We came to an anchor
under a little point of land, but pretty high:
and the tide beginning to flow, we lay ready
to go further in ; hut Xury, whose youthful and
penetrating eyes were sharper than mine, in a
soft tone, desired me to keep far from land,
lest We should he devoured; " For, look yon.-
" der, mayster, and see de dreadful monster
"' fast asleep on de side of de hill." Accord-
ingly looking where he pointed, l espied a
tearful monster indeed. It was a terrible great
lion that lay on shore, covered as it were by a
shade of a piece ot'the hill. " Xury," said I,
" you shall go on shore and kill him." But
the hey looked amazed. " Me kill him 3" says
he, " he eat me at one month," meaning one
mouthful. Upon which I bid him lie still, and
charging my biggest gun with two slugs, and
a good charge of powder, and pulling in shore
till we had come within .niusket shot of the
place where he lay, 1 took the best aim I
could to shoot him through the head, but his
leg lying met his nose, the slug broke his
knee bone. The lion awaking with the pain,19

got up, but soon fell down, giving the mest
hideous groan I ever heard; but taking my
second piece, I shot him through the head,
and then he lay struggling for life. Upon this
Xury took heart, and desired my leave to go
on shore. " Go then," said I. Upon which,
taking a little gun in one hand, he swam to
shore with the other, and coming close to the
lion, put a period to his life, by shooting him
again through the head.

But this was spending our ammunition in
vain, the flesh not being good to eat. Xury
was like a champion, and comes on board for
a hatchet to cut off the head of his enemy;
but wanting strength to perform it, he cut off
and brought me a foot. 1 bethought me, how-
ever, that his skin would be of use. This cost
Xury and me awhole day: when spreading it
on the top of our cabin, the hot beams of the
sun effectually dried it in two days time, and
it afterwards served me for a bed to lie on.

And now we sailed southerly, living spar-
ingly on our provisions, and went no oftener
on shore than we were obliged for fresh water,
in hopes to meet some European ship. If
Providence did not favour me, my next course
was to seek for the islands, or lose my life.
among the negroes; in a word, either I must
meet with some ship, or certainly perish.

One day as we Were sailing along, we saw
people standing on the shore and looking at us ;
..we could also perceive they were black, and
.starl: naked. I was inclined to go 0.11 shore; but20

Xury cried, No, no; however, I approached
nearer, and I found they ran along the shore
by me a long way. They had no weapons in
their hands, except one, who held a long
stick, which Xury told me was a lance, with
which they could kill at a great distance. I
talked to them by signs, and made them sen-
sible I wanted something to eat; they beckon-
ed to me to stop my heat, while two of them
ran up into the country, and in less than half
an hour came back, and brought with them
two pieces of dry flesh, and some corn, which
we gratefully accepted; and to prevent any
fears on either side, they brought the food to the
shore, laid it down, then went and stood a
' great way off, till we fetched it on board, and
then came close to us again.

But while we were returning thanks to
them, being all we could afi'ord, two mighty
creatures came from the mountains, one as it;
Were pursuing the other with great fury, which
we were the rather inclined to believe, as they
seldom appear but in the night, and both these
swiftly passing by the negroes, jumped into
the sea, wantonly swimming about, as though
the diversion of the waters had put a stop to
their fierceness. At last one of them coming
nearer to my boat than I expected, or desired,
I shot him directly through the head, upon
'which he sunk immediately, yet rising again,
he would have willingly made to the shore,

the water, he died before he could reach it..'1151'2-7'.' W-

It is impossible to express the consternation
the poor nogroes were in at the firing of my
gun; much less can [mention their surprise,
when they perceived the creature to he slain by
it. I made signs to them to draw it near with
arope, and then gave it to them to haul on
shore. It was a beautiful leopard, which made
me desire its skin; and the negroes seeming
to covet the carcase, I freely gave it to them.
.-\s.for the other lemard, it made to shore,
and ran with a prodigious swiftness out of
sight. The negroes having kindly furnished
me with water, and with what roots and grains
their country afforded, I took my leave, and
after eleven days sail, came in sight of the
Cape de Verd. But the great distance I was

'from it. and tearing contrarv winds would

prevent my reaching them, I. began to grow
melancholy and dejected, when upon a sudden,
Xury cried out, " Master, master," looking as
afl'righted as if it was his master's ship sent in
search of us. But I soon discovered she was
a Portuguese ship. Upon whichI strove for
life to come up to them. But in vain had it
been, if through their perspective glasses, they
had not perceived us, and shortened their sail
to let us come in. Encouraged at this, I set
up my patron's ancient, and fired a gun, both
as signals of distress; upon which they very
kindly lay to, so that in three hours time I came
up with them. They spoke to me in Portu-
guese, Spanish, and French, \but none of these.
did! understand, till at length a Scots sailor22

called, and then I told him I was an English-

,man, who had escaped from the Moors at

Sales, upon which they took me kindly on
board, with all my effects

Having a pleasant voyage to the Brazils,
we arrived 1n the 'Bay de Todos los Santos,
or, All Saints Bay, in twenty- -two days after.
And here I cannot forget the generous treat-
ment of the captain. He would take nothing
for my passage, gave me twenty ducats for
the ledpard's skin, and thi1ty for the lion's. '
Every thing he caused to be delivered to me, and "

To be brief, I bought a settlement next

at Lisbon, of English parents, whose plantay

and for two years we planted only for food:

but the third year we planted some tobacco, '
and each of us dressed a large piece ofr ground,

the ensuing year, for planting sugar--canes.

Iwas in some measure settled, before the
captain who took me up departed fiom the Bra-

stock I had 111 London. desiring his assistance

The ship being titted out, and all things
ready, we set sail the first of September. "55%).
\Ve sailed northward upon the coast. from
whence going further into the ocean out of the
sight of land, we steered as though we were
bound for the island Fernand dc Norenba,
leaving the island on the east; and then it
was we met with a terrible tempest, which
continued for twelve days successively, so
that the winds carried us wheresoever they
pleased. In this perplexity, one of our men
died, and a man and a boy were washed over-
board. W'hen the weather cleared up alittle,
we found ourselves upon the coast of Guiana.
Upon this the captain gave reasons for return-
ing, which I opposed, counselling him to
stand away for Barbadoes, which, as I sup.
posed, might be attained in fifteen days. So
altering our course, we sailed north.west and
by west, in order to reach the Leeward
Islands; but a second storm succeeding, drove
us to the westward, so that we were justly
afraid of falling into the hands of cruel sa~
rages, or the paws of devouring beasts of prey.

In this great distress, one of the men, early in
the morning, cried out, Land-9 Land! which
he had no sooner said, than our ship struck
upon a sand-bank, and, in a moment, the sea
broke over her in such a manner that we ex~
pected we should perish immediately. We
knew not where we were, or upon what land
we were driven, whether it was an island or
the main, inhabited or not' inhabited, and we0")

could not so muvh as hope. that the ship
would hold out many minutes, without hreak-
ing in pieces, unless the wind by a miracle
should turn about immediately. \Vhile we
stood looking at one another, expecting death
every moment, the mate lays hold of the boat,
and with the help of the rest got her flung
over the ship's side; into this we all got, being
eleven in number and committed ourselves to
(iou's mercy, and the wild sea. And' now we
saw that this last effort would not be a saili-
(-iont protection from death; so high did the
sun rise. that it was impossible the boat should
live. As to making a sail we had none, nei-
ther if we had, could we make use ofany. So
that when we had rowed, or rather werodriven
about a league and a half, a raging wave, like
a loft}- monntain, came rolling a-stern of us,
and took us with such fury, that at once it
overset the boat. Thus being swallowed up
in a moment, we had only-time to call upon
the awful name of God, and to implore, in
dying ejaculations, his infinite mercy to re-
ceive our departing souls. -

Men are generally counted insensible, when
struggling in the pangs of death; but While I
was overwhelmed With water, I had the most
dreadful apprehensions imaginable, for the
thoughts of every thing which I had done
amiss came crowding to my mind. I had dis-
olieyed my parents, I had slighted their ad-
Vice, I had left them to follow my own way-
ward inclination, and [was now about to ap.

extremity. while all my companions were over-
powered and entombed in the deep; and it was
with great diflieulty I kept my breath till the
wave spent itself, and, retiring back, left me
on the shore half dead with the water I had
taken in. As soon as I got on my feet, I ran
as fast as I could, lest another wave should
pursue me, and carry me back again. But for
all the haste I made, 1 could not avoid it, for
the sea came after me like a high mountain, or
a furious enemy; so that my business was to
hold my breath, and by raising myself on the
water, to save myself by swimming. The next
dreadfirl wave buried me at once twenty or
thirty feet doe , but at the same time, carried
me. with a mig ity force and swiftness towards,
the shore, when raising myself, I held out as
well as possible, till. at length, the water, hav-
ing spent itself, began to return, at which I
struck forward, and feeling ground again with
my feet, I took to my heels. Thus being
served twice more, I was at last dashed against
apiece of rock, in sucha manner, as left me
senseless, but recovering a little before the re-
turn of the wave, which no doubt would then
overwhelm me, I held fast by the rock till those
succeeding waves abated; and then fetching
another run, was overtaken by a small wave,

knife, a tobacco pipe, and a box half filled
with tobacco. The darkseme nigh't coming-

in despair, and having no prospect, as I
thought of life before \me, I prepared for ano-

caped. I walked about a fur-long to see if I
could find any fresh water, which I did 'to my ~

It was broad day, the. next morning, before I.
:m'oke, when Inot only perceivml the tempest
was ceased, but saw the ship driven almost as
liar as the. rook before mentioned, which was
about a mile from the place where I was.--
\\'hen I came down from my apartment in the
tree, I perceived the ship's boat two miles dis-
tant on my right hand, lying on shore as the
waves had cast her. I thought to have got 10'
her; but there being an inlet of water about
half a mile's breadth between it and me, I re-
turned again towards the ship, as hoping to
tiud something for my more immediate subsist-
ence. About noon, when the sea was so calm
that I could come within a quarter of a mile of
her, it was to my grief I perceived, that if we
had kept on heard, all our lives would have
been saved. These thoughts and my solitude
drew tears from my eyes, though all in vain.
So resolving to get to the ship, I stripped and .
waded as far as I could find de )th; after: which,
swimming round her, I was agraid I could not
get any thing to lay hold of; butit was my good
fortune to espy a. small piece of rope hanging
down so low, that, by the help of it, though
with great difficulty, 1 got into the ship. Here
I found that-the ship was bilged, and had a great
deal of water in her, her stern was lifted up
against a bank, and her head almost in the
water. ' All her quarter, and what was there,
were free and dry. The provisions I found in
good order, and, losing no time, ate while I
was doing other things. [also found-some

or two, and two or three large spars of wood.
\'r'ith these I fell to work, and slung as many
of them ever heard as I could manage, tying
every one of them with a rope that they might
not drive away. This done, I went down the
ship's side, and tied four of them fast together
at both ends, in form of a raft, and laying two
or three. short Pieces of plank upon them cross-
wa'ys, I tonne it would hear me. hutnot any
eimsidcrahle Weight. Upon which I went to
work again, cutting a spare top-mast into three
lengths, adding them to my raft, with a great
deal of labour and pains. I then, first laying
upon it all the planks and hoards I could get,
next lowered down three of the seamenfs chests,
after Iliad tilled them with bread, rice, three
Dutch cheeses, five pieces of dried goats flesh,
and some European corn, what little the rats
had spared; and for liquors, I found several
cases of bottles, in which were some'cordial
waters, and four or five gallons of arrack. By
this time, the. tide beginning to flow, I per-
ceived my coat, waistcoat, and shirt swim
away, which I had left on shore; as for my
linen, bree ches, and stockings, I swam with them
to the ship; butI soon found clothes enough,
though I took no more than I wanted for. the
present. My eyes were chiefly on tools to31

work with, and after along search, I found out
the carpenter's chest, which I got safe down
on my raft. I then looked for arms and ammu-
nition, and in the great cabin, found two good
fowling pieces, two pistols, several powder
horns filled, a small bag of shot, and two rusty
swords, I likewise found three barrels of pow.
der, two of which were good, but the tliird
had taken water, also two or three broken oars.
two saws, an axe, and a hammer. I then put
to sea, and in getting to shore had three ad-
vantages in my favour. l. A smooth calm sea.
2. The tide rising and setting in to the shore.
3. The little wind there was, lowing towards
land. After I had sailed about a mile, I found
the raft driving a little distance from the place
where I first landed, and then I perceived an
opening of the land, with a strong current of
the tide running into it, upon which I kept the
middle of the stream, But great was my cou- '
corn, when on a'sudden, the forepart of my
raft .ran aground. But after some time the ris-
ing of the water caused the raft to float 'again,
and coming up a little river, with land on both
sides, I landed in a little cave, as'near the
mouth as possible, the better to discover a sail,
if any such providentially passed that way.
Not far off, I espied a hill of stupendous
height, surrounded with smaller hills about it,
and thither I was resolved to go and view the
country, that I might see what part was best
to fix my habitation in. Accordingly, arming
myself with a pistol, a fowling piece, powder,0'8.
03

'andball, Iascended the mountain. There I
perceived l was in an island, encompassed by
the sea, no distant lands to be seen, but scat-
tering rocks that lay to the west; it seemed
to be a barren place, and as I thought, only
inhabited by wild beasts. I perceived abund-
ance of fowls, but was ignorant of w1-.-~..t kind,
or whether good for nourishment. I shot one
of them at my return, which occasioned a con-
fused screami-ng among the other birds, and I
found it, by its colour and beak, to be a kind of
hawk, but its flesh was perfect carrion.

When I came to my raft, I brought my
effects on shore, which work spent that day en.
tirely; and fearing that some cruel beast
might devour me in the night time while I slept,
I made a kind of hut, or barricade, with the
chests and boards I had brought on shore.
That night, I slept very comfortably; and the
next morning my thoughts were employed to
make a further attempt 'to this ship, and bring
away what necessaries I could find, before ano-
ther storm should break her in pieces. Accord-
ingly, I got on board as before, and prepared a
second raft far more nice than the first ; upon
which, I brought away the carpenter's stores,
two or three bags full of nails, a great jack-_
screw, a dozen or two of hatchets, and a grind-
stone. I also took two or three iron crows,
two barrels of musket bullets, another fowling
piece, a small quantity of powder, and a large
bag full of small shot. Besides these, I took

all the men's clothes I 909M, find, a spare fore:ROBINSON Cnvson on hisRaft.34

top-sail, a hammock, and some bedding; and
thus completing my second cargo, I made all
the haste to shore I could, fearing some wild
beast might destroy what I had there already.
But I only found a little wild cat sitting on one
of the chests, who not seeming to fear me, or
the gun that I presented at her, I threw her a
piece of biscuit, which she instantly eat and
departed.

When I had got these efi'ects on shore, I
went to work in order to make me a little tent
with the sail and some poles, which I had cut
for that purpose, and having finished it, what
things might be damaged by the weather, I
brought in, piling all the empty chests and casks
in a circle, the better te fortify it against any
sudden attempt of man or beast. After this, I
blocked Up the doors with some boards, and an
empty chest turned the long way out. I then
charged my gun and pistol, and laying my bed
on the ground, slept as comfortably till the
next morning as though I had been in a chris-
tian country. '

Now though I had enough to subsist me a
long tim e,' yet despairing of a sudden deliverance,
and fearing that both ammunition and provision
might be spent before such a thing happened,
I saved as much as I could, and so long as the
ship remained in that condition, I daily brought
away one necessary or other: particularly the
rigging, sails, and cordage : some twine, a bar~
rel of wet powder, some sugar, a barrel of meal,
three casks of rum, and indeed what was most
welcome to me,a whole hogshead of bread.35

The next time I went, I cut the cables in
pieces, carried oil' a havser whole, with a great
deal of iron work, and made another raft; but
this being so unwieldy, by the too heavy bur-
'den upon it, and 1 not being able so dexte-
rously to guide it as the former, both my cargo
and myself were overturned. For my part, all
the damage I sustained was a wet skin : and at
low water, after much labour in diving. [got
up most of the cables, and some pieces of Iron.

Fifteen days had I now been on the island,
and eleven times on board, bringing away all
that was possible. As I w: s going the twelfth
time, the wind began to rise; however I ven-
tured at low water. and rummaging the cabin,
in a locker, I found several razors, scissars. and
some dozens of knives and forks, and in ano-
tber, thirty--six pounds in pieces of eight, silver
and gold. I wrapt the money up in a piece of
canvas, and began to think of making another _
raft; but I soon perceived the wind beginning '
to rise, a fresh gale blowing from the shore.
and the sk y overcast with clouds and darln'uess.
So thinking a raft to be in vain, I let myself
into the vater with what things 1 had about
me; and it V'as with great difficulty I got
ashore, when soon after it blew a fearful storm.

That night Islept-very contentedly in my
little tent. surrounded with all my et'l'eets; but.
when I looked out in themorning, no more ship
was to be seen. This much surprised me for36

the present; yet. when I considered that I had
lest no time, abated no pains, and had got
eveiy thing usel'ul out of her, i comforted my-
sell in the best manner, and entirely submitted
to Divine Piovidence.

My Next thoughts were, how] should de-
fend and secure myelf from sav ages and Wild
heasts, if anv such were in the island.

W lien I considezed the ground where I was,
that it was 111:11sl1xf, and Dhad no fresh water
1111: 11 it DIV 1eselutions 11 ere to search for a soil
healthv and well watered, wheie l 111ioht not
onlv he sheltered from the. s1.'s111 scorching heat,
but he more conveniently situated, as well to be
secured from wild men, and beasts of prey, as
more easily to discover any distant sail, should
it ever so happen.

And indeed it was not long before I had my
desire I tound a little plain near a rising hill,
the front towa1ds which, being as steep as a
house-side, nothing could descend on me from

he top.

0n the side of this rock was a little hollow
place, resembling the entrance or door of 3
cm e. Just hef01e this place, on the circle of
the green, I 1esol1ed my tent should stand.
This plain did not much exceed a hundred yards
broad, and about twice as long, like a delight-
tul g1een befo1e my door, with a pleasing,
though ir1egula1 descent every way to the low
mounds by:3 the sea side, sheltered from the
excessixe heat of the sun. Xfter this I drew a
s"-'1nicircle, twenty feet in diameter, driving37

down two rows of strong stakes not six inches
from each other. Then, with the pieces of
cables which [had euton board, I regularly laid
them in a circle between the piles, up to their
tops. which were more than live feet out of the
earth, and then drove another row of pile-s look-
ing within side against them, l.>etween two and
three feet high, which made me conclude it a
little castle impregnable by men and beasts.
And for my better security, I would have no
door, but entered in and came out by the help
of a ladder, which I also made.

Here was my fence and fortress, into which
I carried all my riches, ammunition, and stores.
After which, working on the rock, what with
the dirt and stones I dug out, I not only raised
my ground two feet, but made a little cellar to
my mansion house; and this cost me many days
labour and pains. One day, in particular, a
shower of rain falling, thunder and lightning,
ensued, which put me in terror, lest my powder
should take fire, and not only hinder my neces-
sary subsistence, by preventing me from killing
my food, buteven blow up mo and myhabitation.
To prevent which, Ifell to making boxes and
bags, in order to separate it, having by me near
150le. weight. And thus being established as
king of the island, every dayI went outwith my
gun, to see what I could kill that was fit. to eat.
I soon perceived numbers of goats,but very shy ;
yet having watched them narrowly, and seeing I
cauld better shoot them off the rocks, than when

c38

in the low grounds, I happened to shoot a shoe
goat suckling a young kid; which, not thinly
ing its dam slain, stood by'her unconcerned;
and when I took the dead creature>> , the
young one followed me even to the measure.
l lifted the kid over the pales, and Would wil-
lingl'); have kept it alive, but finding it could}
not e brought to eat, I was forced to slay it
also for my subsistence: ' '
Thus, entered upon a life of solitude, I had
most melancholy apprehensions concerning my
deplorable condition ; and many times, the tears
would plentifully run down my face, when I
considered how I was debarred from all com.
munication with human kind. Yet while these
desponding thoughts would seem to make me.
- accuse Providence, other good thoughts Would
interposc and reprove me after this manner:
" 'Well, supposing __:~yhu are desolate, is it not '
" better to be so than totally perish? Why
" should you - complain, when not only your
'.' life was preserved, but the ship driven into
" your reach, in order to take What Was ne-
"' cessary out of her for a subsistence?" But
to proceed : It was, by the account I kept, the
30th of September, when I first landedon this
island. About twelve days often, fealflrtg lest
f 1 should loose my reckoning of time, his? even

, . forget the sabbath days, for want-of pen, ink,

and paper, I carved with a. knife-u on a large
rest, in great letters. I came on s are, Sept.
cm, 365:}, and eat it up in- the simihtude of a' 39 ,
cross, on the seashore where I landed. Every
day I cut a notch with my knife on the sides of '
the square post, and that on the Sabbath was
as long again as-the rest, and every 'fii's't da
of the month, as long again as that long one.;
In this manner, I kept my calendar, weekly,'
monthly; or yearly reckoning of time. But
had I' made a more strict search (as I did aft-
terwar.ls,) I need not. have set up. this mark'
For among the parcels belonging to the gun-"
ner, carpenter, and captain's mate, I found
these very things I wanted ;- particularly pens,

ink, and paper; also 1 found turo in three
eOmPasses, ' some mathematical instruments,
dials, perspective glasses, books of pavigationt
three" English bibles, and several other good
books, which I carefully ut up. Here I can-

'still I found several things wanting. My in'k'

I am cast upon a

How miser able am I,

Like a hermit (ra-

My clothes, after

shall have none to

shall I remain without
any defence against
wild men and beasts.

But yet I am pre-
served While my com--
panions have perished
in the raging sea.

Yet set apart to
be spared from death.
~\nd He, who has so
preserved me, can de-
liver me from this con-
dition.

However, I have
food to eat, and even
a happy prospect of
subsistence whilst life
endures.

At present I enjoy
vhat is absolutely
needful; and the cli-
mate is so hot, that
had I ever so many,

1 should hardly wear
them.

Yet even thus, I see
no danger of any to
hurt me, as in Africa;
and What if I had been
cast away upon that
coast.

assistance where I till he sends thee dc-
might hepe for relief. liverance.

And new, easing my mind a little by these
reflections, I began to render my life as easy
as possible

I must here add to the description I have
given of my habitation, that having raised a
turf wall against the outside of it, I thatched it
so close as might keep it from the inclemency
of the weather; I also improved it within, en-
larged my cave, and made a passage and a
door in the rock. which came out beyond the
pale of my fortification. I next proceeded to
make a chair and table, and so began to study
such mechanical arts as seemed to me practi-
cable. When I wanted a plank or a board, I
hewed down a tree with my hatchet, making it
as thin with my axe as possible, and then
smooth enough with an adze, to answer my de-
signs; yet though I could make no more this
way than one board out of a tree, in length of
time I got boards enough to shelter all my
stores, every thing being regularly placed, and
my guns securely hanging against the side of a
rock. This made it a very pleasant sight to
life, being the result of vast labour and great
diligence; which leaving for a while, and me
to the enjoyment of it, I shall give the reader an42

account of some parts of my journal from the
day of my landing, till the settling of my ha-
bitation, as heretofore shown.

JOURNAL.
SEPTEMBER. 30th, 1659, I, Robinson

Crusoe, having sufi'ered shipwreck, was driven
on this desolate island, which I named the
Desolate Island of Despair, the rest of my
companions being swallowed up in the tem-
pestuous ocean. That day I spent in conside-
ration of my unhappy circumstances, having
no prospect but of. death, either to be starved
with hunger, or devoured by wild beasts or
merciless savages.

Oct. 1. That morning, with great comfort, I
beheld the ship driven ashore. Some hopes I
had, that when the storm was abated, I might
be able to get some food and necessaries out of
rer; which I conceived were not damaged,
because the ship remained upright. At this
time, I lamented the loss of my companions.
and our misfortune in leaving the vessel. \Vhen
l perceived the ship, as it were, to lie dry, I
waded through the sands, as far as I could find
depth, then swam aboard, the weather being
very rainy, and with scarcely any wind.

Oct. 5, My raft, and all the goods thereon
were overset; yet I recovered most again at
low water.

To the llth of this month, my time was em-
loved in making voyages every tide, gettin43

what] could out of the ship. The weather
very wet and uncertain.

Oct. 15. It blew hard, and ruined night and
day, when the ship went to pieces, so that no.
thing was seen of her but the wreck at low
water. This day l secured my goods from the
inclemency of the weather.

Oct. 16. I wandered to see where [could
find a. place convenient for my abode: I fixed
upon a rock in the evening, marked out a. half
moon, intending to erect awall fortified with
piles, lined within with pieces of cables, and
covered with turf.

Nov. 3. I shot two wild-fowl, resembling
ducks, which were good to eat, and in the at-
. terno'on began to make me a table.

Nov. 4. I began to live regularly. In the
morning, I allowed myself two or three hours
to walk out with my gun; I then worked till
near eleven o'clock; and afterwards refreshed
myself with what I had to eat. From twelve
to two, I would lie down to sleep. Extreme
sultry weather. In the evening goto work
again.

Nov. 5. Went out with my gun and dog,
shot a. wild cat with a. soft skin, but her flesh
was good for nothing. The skins of those
killed I preserved. In my retum I perceived
many wild bird-s, and was terrified by some
seals which made oil' to sea.

Nov. 6. Completed my table.

Nov. 7. Fair weather. I worked to the
12th, but omitted the 11th, which according
to my calculation, 1 suppou-d to he Simday.

\44

Nov. 17. I began to dig in the rock, yet was
obliged to desist for want of a pick-axe, shovel
and Wheel-barrow. Iron crows I used to sup-
ply the place of the first. but with all my art
I could not make a wheel-barrow.

Nov. 19. It was a great happiness to me to
find a tree resembling what the Brazilians call
an Iron tree. I had like to spoil my axe with
cutting it, it being very hard, and exceedingly
heavy; yet with much labour and industry I
made a sort of spade out of it.

Nov. 23. These tools being made, I daily
carried on my business; eighteen days I allow-
ed for enlarging my care, that it might serve
me, not only for a warehouse, but kitchen, pare
lour, and cellar. Icommonly lay in the tent,
'unless the weather was so rainy that I could
not lie dry. So wet would it be at certain sea-
sons, that I was obliged to cover all within
the pale, with long poles, in the form of rafters,
leaning against the rock, and load them with
flags and large leaves of trees resembling a.
thatch.

Dec. 10. No sooner did I think my habita-
tion finished, but suddenly a great. deal of the
top broke in, so that it was a mercy I was not
buried in the ruins. This occasioned a great
deal of pains and trouble to me, before I could
make it firm and durable.

Dec. 17. I nailed up some shelves, and drove
nails and staples in the wall and posts, to hang
every thing out of the way.

Dec. '20. I got every thing into its place,
than made a sort of dresser, and another table.45

Dec. 27. I chanced to light upon some goats,
shot one, wounded another; 1 led it home in a
string, bound up its leg, and cured it in a little
time; at length, it became so tame and familiar
as to feed before the door, and foliow me where
I pleased. This put me in mind to bring up
tame creatures, in order to supply me with food
after my ammunition was spent.

Dec. '28, 29, 30. The Weather being exces-
sively hot, with little air, obliged me for the
most part, to keep Within doors.

Jan, 3. to 14. My employment this time
was to finish the wall before described, and
search the island. I discovered a kind of pi-
geons, like our house pigeons, in a nest among
the rocks. I brought them home, nursed them
till they- could fly, and then they left me. Af.
ter this, I shot some, which proved excellent
food. Some timel spent vainly contriving to
make a. cask, I may well say it was in vain,
because I could neither joint the staves, nor
fix the heads, so as to make it tight; so leav-
ing that, I took some goat's tallow Iliad by
me, and a little oakum for the Wick, and pro-
vided myself with a lamp, which served instead
of candles,

But now a very strange event happened. For
being in the height of my search, what should
come into my hand, but a bag which was used
to hold corn (as I supposed) for the fowls ; so
immediately resolving to put gunpowder into it.
I shook all the husks and dirt upon one side of

a. rock, little expecting what the consequence
c 5; 46

would be. The rain had fallen plentifully a
few days before; and about a month after, to
my great amazement, something began to look
out very green and flourishing; and when I
came to view it more nicely, everyday as it
grew, I found about ten or twelve ears of green
barley of the very'same shape and make asthat
in England, ,

I can scarcely express the agitation of my
mind at this sight. Hitherto I had been used,
like too 'many in the world, to look with in-
difference upon the marks of God's goodness,
which are every where visible. Indeed so ig-
norant was I, that'I had even thought health,
and food, and clothing to be the mere result'
of our own labour and care and foresight,
without ever reflecting, that the Almighty is
the bestower of every good and perfect gift,
and that it is his blessing alone upon our
efforts which makes them to prosper. The ap-
pearance of the barley flourishing so unexpect-
edly in a barren soil, and my ignorance of the
manner in which it came there, led me into a.
singular opinion. 1 concluded that miracles
were not ceased, and that God had appointed
the barley to grow there without any seed,
purely for my sustenance in this miserable and
desolate island. And indeed such great effect/
had this upon me, that it often made me melt
into tears through a grateful 'sense of God's
mercies: and the greater still was my thankful-
ness, when l perceived about this little field of

barley, some rice stalks, also wonderfully
' lu'1(r_ ' V ' .

w,4?

While thus pleased in mind, I concluded
there must be some more com in the island,
and therefore made a diligent search narrowly
among the rocks; but not being able to find
any, on a sudden it came into my mind, how I
had shaken the bushs of corn out of the bag.
and then so blind was my understanding, that
my admiration ceased, and with it my grati~
tude to the Divine Being, as Min/ring it was
621! natural. and not to be conceived a mira-
cle: though even the manner of its preserva-
tion might have made me own it as a wonder-
ful event of God's kind providence.

It was about the latter end of June when the
ears of this corn ripened. which I laid up very
carefully, together with '20 or 30 stalks of rice.
expecting one dayI should reap the fruit of
my labour: yet four years were exPired before
I could allow myself to eat any barley bread; _
and much longer time, before I had any rice.
Nter this, with indefatigable pains and industry
tbr three or four months, at last I finished my
house, having no way to go into it, but by a
ladder against the wall.

April 16. Itinished my ladder, and ascend- .
ed it; afterwards pulled it up, then let it down
on the other side, and descended into my new
habitation, where I had space enough, and was
so fortified, that nothing could attack me with-
out sealing the walls.

But what does all human art and industry
avail, if the blessing of God does not crow:
our labours? Or who can stand lmt'ore ths
Almighty; When he streteheth forth his am'48

For, one time, when I was at the entrance of
my cave, there happened such a dreadful earth-
quake, that not only the roof of the cave came
tumbling about my ears, but the posts seemed to
crack terribly at the same time. This put me
in a great amazement; and running to the lad-
der and getting over the wall, I then plainly
knew it was an earthquake, the place I stood on
sustaining three terrible shocks in less than three
minutes. But judge of my terror when 1 saw
the t0p of a great rock roll into the sea: I then
expected the island would be swallowed up
every moment: and what made the scene still
more dreadful, was to see the sea thrown into
the most violent agitations and disorders by this
tremendous convulsion of nature.

F or my part, I expected every moment to
be swallowed up. At the moving of the earth,
I was, as it were, sea-sick; and very much
afraid lest the rock, under which was my fence
and habitation, should overwhelm me and it in
a lasting tomb.

It was only the day after, when a horrible
tempest arose. at the same time attended with a
hurricane of wind. Three hours did this storm
continue, and in so violent a manner as to tear
the very trees up by the roots, which was sue-
ceeded by abundance of rain. When the term
pest was over, I went to my tent; but the rain
coming on in a furious manner, I was obliged
to take shelter in the care, where I was forced
to cut a channel through my fortification. to let
the water out. It continued raining all that49

night, and some time the next day. These ac-
cidents made me resolve, as soon as the wee...
ther cleared up, to build me alittle hut in some
open place, walled round to defend me from
wild creatures and savages; not doubting, but,
at the next earthquake, the mountain would
fall on my habitation and me, and swallow up
all in its bowels; but to resume the thread of
my narration which this mention of the storm
has interrupted.

April 16--20. These days I spent, in con.
triving how and in what manner I should fix
my place of abode. All this While, I was un-
der the most dreadful apprehensions. When
I looked round my habitation, every thing I
found in its proper place. I had several de-
bates whether I should move or not; but at
length resolved to stay where I v as. till I found
out a convenient place where I might pitch my
tent. '

April 22. When I began to put my resolu-
tions in practice, I was stopped. for want of
tools and instruments to work with. Most of
my axes and hatchets were useless, occasioned
by cutting the hard timber that grew on the
island. It took me up a full week to make my
grindstone of use to me; but at last I found
out a way to turn it about with my foot, by
help of a wheel and a string.

, 'April 30. My bread falling short, I allowed

myself but one biscuit a (lav.

May I. As I walked along the sea shore, I
found a barrel of gun powder, and several

pieces of the wreck whic the sea had flung50

up. Having secured theseyl made to the ship.
whose stern was torn OE, and washed 5a great
distance ashore; but the rest lay in the sands,
This, I supnose, was occasioned by the earth- .
quake, I now resolved to keep my old place
of abode :. and also to get to the ship that day,
but found it impossible.

May 3. This day 1 went on board the wreck,
which still remained upon its bed of rock,
though the waves had carried away all its upper
works and left nothing standing. but the part
between decks, and with my saw sawed off one
of the beams, which kept her uartei' deck--'-
1 then cleared the sand till flood1 .

May 4. I caught some fish, but they Were
not wholesome. The same day, I also caught
a young dolphin. , '
, May 5. This day also I repaired to the wreck,
and sawed another piece of timber; and when
the flood came, I made afloat of three great
planks, which were driven ashore by the tide,

May "6--9. These days, I brought 011' th
iron bolts, opened the deck with the iron
Crow, and carried two planks to land, having
made a way into the very middle of the wreck.

May 10-314. All this~tirne Iispent in bring-
ing ofl' great quantities of irOn and timber.

May 15. Took with me two hatchet; on
purpose to cut off some lead from the roll. but
all in vain, for it lay too low under water.

M ay 24. To this day, I worked on the
wreck, and with great difficulty loosened some
things so much with the crow, that at the first
blowing tide, several casks floated out, and .se-

veral of the 'seanien's chests ; yet that day no-
thing came to land but pieces of timber, and a
hogshead which had some pork in it.. I conti-
nued working to the 15th of June, (except
necessary times for food and rest) and had I
known how to build a boat, I had timber and
planks enough; I had also nearly 100 weight
of sheet lead.

June 16. As I was wandering towards the
sea-side, I found a large tortoise or turtle. being
the first 1 had seen on the island, though, as l
afterwards found, there were many on the other
side of it.

June 17. This day I spent in cooking it, found
in her three score eggs. and her flesh the most
savoury and pleasant I ever tested in my life.

June 18. I staid within this day, there. being
a continual rain; and it was somewhat more
chilly and cold than usual. _

June 19. Exceedingly ill, taken with 21 iron:--
bling and shivering.

June 20. Awake all night, my head racked
with pain and feverish.

June 2!. Sick unto death, and terrified with
dismal apprehensions of my condition. Frayed _.
to God more frequently, but very confused j. . 1'

J une 2'2. Something better, but still uneasy
in my mind.

June '23. Again relapsed much as before.

June 24. Mended a second. time.

June '25. A violent ague for seven hours, cold
and hot fits, succeeded by faint sweats.

June '26. Better, but very weak ; yet I
scrambled out, shot a she gnat, brought it home,and broiled some of it; {would willingly have
stewed it, and made some broth, but had no
wt.

1 June .17. All this day I was afflicted with
an ague: thirsty, yet could not help myself to
water: prayed to God in these words: Lom'
2'22 12229, [002% upon me: Lord leave rzzercy upon
me .' luwe rezerc'r/ upon me .' After this I fell
asleep, which, when l awakened, I found had
much refreshed me.

I rose up in a pensive manner, being so
thoughtful that I could not go to sleep; and
tearing the dreadful return of my distemper, it
caused me to remember, that the Brazilians
use tobacco for almost all diseases. 1 then
went to my chest, in order to find some, where
it was my happiness to find a cure, both for
soul and body; for there I found one of the
Bibles, which till this time, 1 had neither lei-
sure nor inclination to look into; I took both
the tobacco and that out of my chest, and laid
them on the table. Several experiments did
I try with the tobacco : First, I took a piece of
leaf, and chewed it; but it being very green and
strong, almost stupitied me; next, I steeped it
in some rum an hour or two, resolving when
1 went to bed to take a dose of it: and in the
third place, 1 hurnt some over a pan of fire,
holding my nose over it so long as I could
endure it Without suffocation.

In the intervals of this operation, though my
head was giddy and disturbed by the tobacco,
I took up the Bible to road. No sooner did I

open it, but there appeared to me these words,53

Cali on me in the day of frozzdle, and I 21117!

At first, this sentence made a wry deep i111-

foreign to me. And as the children of Israel
said, when they were promised flesh to eat,
Can Goa spread a table 2'". [lie wilderness ? In
the like manner I began to say, Can God him-
self deliver me from this desolate island? How-
ever, the words would still return to my mind,
and afterwards made a greater impression upon
me. As it now was 111111 late, and the tobacco
had dozed 111v head, I was inclined to sleep;
but befme I would lie do11n,Ifell on my
knees, and implored the promise that God had

drank the rum, wherein I had steeped the to-
bacco, which flying into my head, threw me
into such a profound sleep that it was three
o clock the next day helore I awoke; or, rather,
I bel1e1 e, I slept two day, s having certainly lost
a dayr in my account, as I afterwards disco-
vered, and I could never tell any other way.--
W'hcn I got up, my spirits were lively and
cheerful: my stomach much better, being very
hungry; and, in short. no tit returned the next
dm , which was the 29th, but I found my self
1111ich altered for the better.

July 4. This morning, I began seriously to
ponder on what is written in the New Testa-
ment, resolving to read a chapter every morn.
ing and night, as long as my thoughts would
engage me. As soon as I set about this Work
seriously, i found my heart deeply affected
with the impiety of my past life. After this
I begged of God to assist me with his holy
Spirit in returning to my duty. One day in pe-
rusing the Scripture, I came to these words,
Him Ital/z God cam/{ed wit/e 122's rig/a! famed 1'0
[:3 a [Vi/Ice mad a Saviour jar to give repen-
tmzce mu! _/brgz'velzes-s (3/. sins. Immediately
I laid down the book, and with Upiiited hands
to Heaven, loudly cried, O blessed Jesus, Md:

Saviour, give me repentance : And, now in-
deed, I pray ed with a true sense of my condi-
tion, and a more certain hope, founded on the
word of God. Now, I had a different sense of
these words, Call on me, and I will deliver (r5: 0,.55

that is, from the dreadful load of guilt, which
Oppressed my sinful soul. and not from a soli-
tary life : in a word, I came. to this conclusion,
that a deliverance from sin was a much greater
blessing than a deliverance from atliiction.

To the 14th J nly, I walked about with my
gun, little and little at a time, having been re-
duced to the greatest extremity of weakness.
The a plications and experiments I used were
perfect y new : neither could I recommend
them to any one's practice. For though it car-
ried of? the fit, it very much weakened me ; and
I had frequently convulsions in my nerves and
limbs for some time. From hence I learned.
that going abroad in rainy weather, especially
when it was attended with storms and hurri-
canes of wind, was most pernicious to health.
I had now been above nine months in the
island ; and as I had never seen any of the hu-
man kind, I therefore accounted myself as sole
monarch : and as I grew better, having secured
my habitation to my mind, I resolved to make
a tour round my kingdom, in order to make
new discoveries.

The 15th July, I began my journey; I first
went to the creek where I had brought my
rafts on shore, and travelling farther, found
the tide went no higher than two miles. up,
where there was a little brook of running wa-
ter, on the bank of which were many pleasant
savannahs or meadows, smooth, plain and co-
vered with grass. On the rising parts, where I

' "supposed the water did not reach, I perceived a
great deal of tobacco growing to a very strong56

stalk. Several other plants Ilikewisc [unruly
the virtues of which I did not understand. I
searched a longtime for the Cassava root, WlliCh
I knew the Indians in that. climate made their
l'l't'ad of; hut all in vain. There were several
plants of aloes, though at that time I knew mt
what they were : likewise I saw several sugar-
canes, but imperfect for want of cultivation-
".ith these few discoveries, I came back that
night, and slept contei'itcdly in my little castle.

The rest day, being the IGth, going the
same way, but farther than the day before, I
found the country more adorned with woods
and trees. Here I perceived different fruits in
great abundance. Melons in plenty lay on the
ground, and clusters of grapes, ripe and very"
rich spread over the trees. You may imagine
I was glad of this discovery, yet ate very spar-
ingly, lest I should throw myself into a flux 01'
fever. The grapes 1 found of excellent use;
tor when I dried them in the sun, which pre-
served them as dried raisins are kept, they
proved very Wholesome and nourishing, and
served me in these seasons when no grapes were
it) l)C had.

The night drawing on apace, I ascended a
tree, and slept very comfortably, though it was
the. lirst time I had slept out of my habitation.
And when the morning came. I proceeded \i'ith
great pleasure on my way. travelling ahout four
miles, as I imagined, 1);; the length of the val-
ley. At the end of this valley, I came to an
opening, where the country seemed to descend57

to the west; there I found a spring of fresh
water, proceeding out of the side of the hill,
with its crystal streams running directly east---
And indeed here my senses were charmed with
the most beautiful landscape nature could af.
ford; for the country appeared so flourishing,
green and delightful, that to me it seemed like
a planted garden. I then descended on the
side of that delicious vale, when I found abun-
dance ol' cocoa, orange, lemon, and citron trees,
but very wild and barren at that time. As for
the limes, they were delightful and wholesome,
the juice of which I afterwards used to mix in
water, which made it very cool and refreshing.
And now I was resolved to carry home and lay
up a store of grapes, limes and lemons, against
the approaching wet season. So laying them
up in separate parcels, and then taking a few of
each with me, I returned to my little castle,
after having spent three days in this journey.
Before I got home, the grapes were so bruised
that they were utterly Spoiled: the limes in-
deed were good, but of those I could bring
only a few.

July 19. Having prepared two bags, I return-
ed thither again, but to my great surprise, found
all the grapes spread about, trodden to pieces,
and abundance eaten, which made me conclude
there were wild beasts thereahouts. To pre-
vent this happening again, I gathered a large
quantity of the grapes, and hung them upon
the out branches of the tree, both to keep them58

'unhurt, and that they might cure and dry in
the sun: and having well loaded myself with
limes and lemons, I returned once more to my
oid place of residence.

And now, reflecting on the fruitfulness of
this valley, the pleasantness of its situation, its
security from storms, and the delightlulness of
the adjacent woods, I concluded I was settled
in the worst .art of the country, and therefore
was thinking to remove my habitation.

But when I considered again, that though it
was pleasant, it was ofl' from the sea-side, where
there was a possibility, some time or other, a
ship might either be driven or sail by : and that
to inclose myself among hills and woods must
certainly put an end to my hopes of deliverance;
I resolved to let my castle remain where Pro-
vidence had first placed it. Yet, so delighted
was i with this place, that I made me a little
kind of bower, surrounding it, with a double
hedge as high as I could reach, well staked and
filled with bulrushes : and having spent a great
part of the month of July, I think it was the
lst of August before I began to enjoy my.
labour.

Aug. 3. Perceiving my grapes to be dry, I
took them from the trees, and they proved ex-
cellent good raisins of the sun; the most of
which 1 carried to my cave; and happy for me
I did so, by v. hich I saved the best part of my
Winter food.

Aug. 1 1. This day it began to rain; and
though II had made me a. tent like the other,
yet hating no shelter of a hill to keep me from59

storms, not a cave behind me to retreat to, I
was obliged to return to my old castle; the
rain continued more or less every day, till the
middle of October, and sometimes so violently
- that I could not stir out of my cave for several.
days. This season 1 found my family to in-
crease; for one of my cats that had run away
from me, and which i thought had been dead,
returned about August, with three kittens at
her heels, like herself; from these cats pro-
ceeded such numbers, that. 1 was forced to kill
and destroy them as I would do wild beasts or
vermin.
To the 26th of this month, I could not stir
out, it rained incessantly: when beginning to
want food, I was compelled to venture twice,
the first of which times, 1 shot a goat, and af-
terwards found a very large tortoise. The
manner of regulating my food was thus: a
bunch of raisins served. me for my breakfast:
.a piece of goat's flesh or turtle boiled for my
dinner, and two or three turtle eggs for my sup-
per. While the rain lasted, 1 daily worked two
or three hours at enlarging my cave, and by
degrees worked it on towards one side of the
hill, and made a door way out, which came be-
yond my fence or wall, and so I came in and
out this way. But after I had done this, I was
troubled to see myself thus ex poeed; though I
could not perceive anything to fear, a goat being
the biggest creature I had seen upon this
island.

_i60

Sept. 30. Casting up the notches on my
post, they amounted to 365, I concluded this

to be the anniversary of my landing; and there-
' fore humbly prostrating myself on the ground,
confessing my sins, acknowledging God's righ-
teous judgment upon me, and praying to him
to have mercy upon me, through Jesus Christ,
I fasted for twelve hours till the going down of
the sun; and then eating a biscuit and a bunch
of grapes, laid me on a bed, and with great
comfort took my night's repose. 'I'ill this time,
though I had always put a larger notch than
ordinary for each sabbath day, to my shame, I
confess it, I had seldom observed it in any other
way. My ink failing soon after, I omitted in
my daily memorandum, things of an indifferent
nature, and contented myself to write down
only the most remarkable events of my life.--
The rainy and dry seasons appeared new re.
gular to me, and experience taught me how to
provide for them: yet in one thing I am going
to relate, my experience very much failed me.
You may call to mind, what I have mentioned
of some barley and rice which I had saved;
about thirty stalks of the former, and twenty
of the latter; and, at that time, the sun being
in its southern position, going from me, toge-
that with the rains, made me conclude it a very
proper season to sow it. Accordingly I dug
up a piece of ground, with my wooden spade,
and dividing it into two parts, sowed about two
thirds of my seeds, preserving hy me a handful

of each. And happy it was I did so ; for no(il

rains falling, it was choked up, and never ap-
peared above the earth till the wet season came
again, and then part of it grew, as if it had
been newly sown.

I was resolved still to make another trial;
and seeking for a moister piece of ground near '
my bower, I there sowed the rest of my seed '
in February, which, by having the rainy
months of March and April to water it, yielded
a noble crop, and sprung up very pleasantly. I
had still saved part of the seed, not daring to
venture all; and by the timeI found out the
proper seasons to sow it in, and that I might
expect every year two seed times and two liar.
vests, my stock amounted to above half a peek
of each sort of grain.

No sooner were the rains over, but the stakes
which I had cut from the trees, shot out like
willows, the first year after lopping their heads.
I was ignorant of the tree 1 cut them from;
but they grew so regularly beautiful, that they
made a most lively appearance, and so flan.
rished in three years time, that I resolved to
cut more of them; and these soon growing
made a glorious fence, as afterwards I shall
observe,

And now I perceived that the seasons of the
year might generally be divided, not into sum-
mer and Winter, as in Europe, but into wet and
dry seasons, as in this manner :------

From February 15 Rainy, em: coming near
To .Aprz'l 15, the Equinox, 2 moat/is.
D62.

From S April l5, Dry, 32m getting aorta
To ZAugust 15, from #28 line, 4 moat/is
From August 15, Wet, [lie sun eez'ng (lien
To October 15, come back, 2 months.
From October 15, Dry, sun running soutfi
T0 Fed/wary 15 g of t/ze line, 4 months.

The wet seasons would continue longer or
shorter, as the wind continued or ceased to blow.
But having found the ill consequences of being
abroad in the rain, I took care before hand to
furnish myself with provisions: and during the
wet months, sat within doors as much as pos-
sible. At this time, I contrived to make many
handy things that I wanted, though it cost me
much labour and pains, before I could accom-
Elish them. The first I tried was to make a

asket, but all the twigs I could get, proved so
brittle, that I could not then perform it. It now
proved of great use to me, that when a boy I
took great delight in standing at a basket-ma-
ker's, in the same town where my father lived,
to view them at work: like other boys, being
curious to see the manner of their working these
things, and very officious to assist, I perfectly
learned the method of it, and wanted nothing
but the tools. And it coming into my mind,
that the twigs of that tree of which I made my
stakes, might be as tough as a. sallow willow, 0f -
osiers growing in England, I resolved to make
an experiment, and w ent the next day to my
country seat, and found some fit for my turn ;
and after cutting down a quantity with my63

hatchet, I dried them in my pale, and. when
fit to work with, carried them to my cave, where
I employed myself in making several sorts of
baskets, insomuch that I could put in what-
soever I pleased. It is true they were not cle-
verly made, yet they served my turn on all oc-
casuons.

But still I wanted two necessary things. I
had no cash to hold my liquor, except two. al-
most full of mm. a few bottles of an ordinary
size, arid some square case bottles; neither had
I a put [2,) boil any thing in, only a large kettle
unfit to make broth, or stew a bit of meat: I
wanted likewise at the beginning of this dry
season a tobacco. pipe ; but for this I afterwards
found an expedient.

I kept myself employed in planting my se-
cond row of stakes. But remembering that
when I travelled up to the brook I had a mind
to see the whole island, I now resumed my in-
tention, and taking my dog, gun, hatchet, two
biscuit cakes, a great bunch of raisins, with a
larger quantity of powder and shot than usual,
I began my journey. Having passed the vale
where my bower stood, I came Within view of
the. sea lying to the west; when, it being a
clear day, I fairly descried land, extending from
the \V. to the S. W. about It) or 15 leagues,
as I concluded: but could not say whether it
was an island or a continent. Neither could I
tell what this place might be: only thought it
was part of America, and where I might have
been in a miserable condition had I landod.<<~

Xgain, I considered, that if this 11115 the Spa- .

nish coast, certainly, one time 01' the other, [1.
should see some ships pass bv, and if it was '
11ot,thon it must be the savage coast between
the Spanish country and Brazil? which abounds
with cannibals or 111an-c1ite1SS." ' '

As' I proceeded for11'ard,l found. this side of
the island much more pleasant than mine; the
fields fragrant, adorned with sweet flowers and
\erdant <<frass,toSS>1.-:.her with seieral v'ery fine '
woods. "There 1111111 parrots 1n plenty, which
made me lonn' for one to be my companion; 1
but it was with <<gm: 'J difficulty 1 could knock
one down with 1111' 51' ick; and i kept him at
home some veers before 1 could get him to call
me by my name. "

In the low "rounds I found various sorts of
hares and foxes, as ltook them to be, but miich
1.iii'ercnt from those in England. Several of. '
thece l l;illo1l,butnc1e1' ate them; neither 1n-
(leed had. [ (1111' oecaeion; for 5.111513111111154 with
goats. pigeons, turtle. and "rape loould' defy
any 111111 not to furnish me' a better tahle. In
this journev , I did not travel ahOVo two miles
a (1111', because 1 took several turhs and wind-
i11g..,to see what d1eco1erioe 1 could make, re.
turning wean enoun'h to the place where l 1111-.
sin-nod to rest all night, which was either in a
a tree. or to a place which I surrounded with
stakesi, that no wild creature might suddenly
surprize me. When I came to the sea.- shore, I
.1133 amazed to see the splendor ofiit. Its strand
was covered with shells of the most beaiitiful65

fish, and constantly abounding with innumera.
ble turtles, and fowls of many kinds, which I
was ignorant of, except those called penguins.
I might have shot as manyasl pleased, but
was sparing of my ammunition, rather choos~
ing to kill a shegoat, which I did with much
difliculty, on account of the flatness of the
country.

N ow, though this journey produced the most
pleasing satisfaction, yet my habitation was so
much to my liking, that I did not repine at my
being seated on the Worst part of the island.
I continued my journey, travelling about 12
miles further towards the east, where Iseta
great pile on the shore for a mark, concluding
that my next journey should bring me to the
other side of the island, east from my castle,
and so round till I came to my post again.--
As I had a constant view of the country, I
thought I could not miss my way deg but scarcely
had I travelled three miles, when I descended
into a very large valley, so surrounded with
hills covered With wood, that having no guide
but the sun, and to add to my misfortune, the
weather proving very hazy, I was obliged to
return to my post by the sea side, and so back-
wards the same way I came. In this journey.
my dog surprised a kid, and would have killed
it, had I not prevented him. As I had often
been thinking of getting a liid or two, and so
raising a. breed of tame goats to supply me,
after my ammunition was spent, 1 took this
opportunity of lit-ginning; and hating made6'6

a collar for this little creature, with a string
made of lopeI yarn, I brought it to my bower,
and there men used and left him. and having
out a month in ti 7is WNW), at length I re-
turned to 7777 old habitation.

Nobody can doubt of my satisfaction. when
I returned to my little castle and YOPOSed my
self in my 17am: neck. After 7777 journey I
ested myself a 77'eelc, which time I emplo7 ed
in making a cage for my pretty poll. Inow
began to recollect the poor kid I had left in
the bower, and immediately went to fetch it
home. When I came there, [found the young
creature almost starved; I gave it some food,
and tied it as h e';l'ore hut there was no occa-
sion. for it follon ed me like a dog;'7 and as i
constantly fed it, it became so lming, gentle,
and fond, that it commenced one of my domes-
tics, and would never leave ,me.

The rainy season of the autumnal equinox
being now come, I kept the 30th of Septem-
her, in the most solemn manner, as usual, it
being the second year of my abode 777 the island.
I spent the Whole day in ack77077ledgi77g God's
mercies in gi7ing thanks for making this soli-
tarv life as agreeable, and less sinful? than that
of human society; and f07 the communication
of his grace to my. soul, in sup orting, comfort-
ing, and encouraging me to depend upon his
P707-idenee, and hope for his eternal presence in
the world to come.

Indeed, I often did consider how much more
happy I was, in this state of life, than in that67 ~-

nmnner of liVing I formerly 11 ed; sometimes.
however when hunting, or viewing the country,
the anguish of my soul VV ould lueak out upon
me, and my very heart VV ould sink within me,
to think of the woods, the mountains, the de~
serts I was in; and how I was a prisoner,
locked up within the eternal bars and bolts of
the ocean, in an uninhabited countrV, without
a hope of escape. In this condition I VV ould
often wring my hands, and weep like a child ,
and even sometimes in the middle of my work,
this fit of melancholy 11011 d often take me;
and then I would sit down and sigh; looking
on the ground for an hour or two together till
such time as my grief got rent in a flood of
tears.

One morning, as I was fully employed in
this manner, I opened my Bible, and hegan to
lead that chapter in which God promises to
Joshua, I zeal! 2zotfzzzl Mag :20) forsake t/zee. '
Surely, if God does not. forsake me, what
matters it, since he can make me more happy
in this state of life, than if I enjOV ed the great'
est splendour 1n the wo1ld. i' 'Xnd VV-hcneV er I
opened or shut the Bible, I hlost kind Provi-
dence, that directed 111V good friend 111 England
to send it among my goods without my order,
and for assisting me to save it hen] the power
of the raging ocean. ~

And now beginning my third year, my se-
Veral daily employments were these: First,
WI y duty to HcaVen, and diligently reading the
holy Scriptures, which I did twice or thrice68

every day: Secondly, Seeking provisions with
my gun, which commonly took me up, when
it \did not rain, three hours every morning;
llama, The ordering, curing, preserving, an't
cooking what I had killed, or catched for my
supply, which took me up a. great part of the
day; for in the middle of "the day, the sun
being at its height, it w'as so hot, that-I could
not stir out: so that I had but four hours in
the evening to work in: and then from the want
of tools, of assistance, and skill, spent a great
deal of time to little purpose: I was no less
than two and forty da'ys, making a board fit
for a long shelf, which two sawyers with their
tools and saw-pit, would have cut out of the
same tree in half a day. It was of a large tree,
as my board was to be broad. I was three
days in cutting it down, and two more in lop-
ping off the boughs, and reducing it to apiece
of timber. ' Thus I hacked and hewed off each
side, till it became light to move; then I turned
it," made one side of it smooth' and flat as a.
board from end to end, then turned it down-
wards, cutting the other side, till _I brought the
plank to be about three inches thick, and smooth
on both sides. Any body may judge my great
labour and fatigue in such a piece of work;
but this I went through with patience, as also\
many other things, that m y circumstances made
necessary for me to do.

The harvest months, November and Decem-
ber, were now at hand, in which I had the

pleading {tr-sport Lit. v. \-'C!':_\-' gee-d crop. But69

here I met with a new misfortune, for the goats
and hares, having tasted of the sweetness of
the blade, kept it so short, that it had no
strength to shoot up into a stalk. T o prevent
this, I enclosed it with a hedge, and by day
shot some of its devourers; and my dog, which
I had tied to the field gate, keeping barking
all night, so frightened these creatures, that 1
got entirely rid of them.

But, no sooner did I get rid of these, than
other enemies appeared. to wit whole flocks of
several sorts of birds, who only waited till my
hack was turned to ruin me. So much did
this provoke me, that I let fly. and killed three
of the nlalefactors ; and afterwards served them
as they do notorious thieves in England and
Ireland, hung them up in chains as a terror
t: others. And indeed, so good an effect had
this. that they not only forsook the corn, but
all that part of the island, so long as these
criminals hung there.

My corn having ripened apace, the latter
end of December, which was my second har-
vest, l reaped it with a scythe made of one of my
bread swords. I had no fatigue in cutting down
my first crop, it was so slender,. The cars I
carried home in a basket, rubbing the grain out
with my hands, instead of threshing it; and
when my harvest was over. fUUHLl my haltlpeek
of seed had produced nearly two bushels of
rice, and two bushels and a :all' of harley.---.
Aud now I plainly foresaw, that by God's good-
mess, I. should be furnished with bread; but70

yeti was CC'llCt'l'lled because I knew not how
to grind or make meal of my corn, neither
knew I how to bake it into bread. I would
not, however, taste any of the crop, but re-
solved to preserve it against next season, and in
the mean while, use my best endeavours to
provide myself with other food.

But where were my labours to end ? the
want of a plough to turn up the earth, or shovel
to dig it, I conquered by making me a wooden
spade. The want of a barrow I suPplied by
dragging over the corn 3. great bough of a tree.
\Vhen it was growing, I was forced to fence it;
when ripe, to mow it, carry it home, thresh it,
part it from the chat}; and save it. And, after
all, I wanted a mill to grind it, a sieve to dress
it, yeast and salt to make it into bread, and an
oven to bake it. This set my brains to work,
to find some expedient for every one of these
necessaries, against the next harvest.

And now liming more. seed, my first care was
to prepare me more land. I pitched upon two
large flat pieces of ground, near my castle, for
that Inn'pose, in which I sowed my seed, and
fenced it with a good hedge. This took me up
three months; by which time the Wet season
coming on, and the rain keeping me within
doors, I found several occasions to employ my-
self,- and while at work, used to divert myself
with talking to my parrot, teaching him to
know and speak his own name Poll 3 the first
vcelmme word l .laad ever heard spoken in the?l
island. I had been a long time mntriving how
to make earthen vessels, which 1 wanted ex-
tremely; and when I considered the heat of the
climate, I did not doubt but, if I could find
any such clay, I might botch up a pot, strong
enough, when driedin the sun, to bear handling.
and to hold any thing that was dry, such as
corn, meal, and other things. _

To be short, the clay, I found ; but it would
occasion the most serious person to smile, to
see what awkward ways I took, and what ugly
misshapen things I made; how many either
fell out or cracked, by the violent heat of the
sun, and fell in ieCcs when they were removed;
so that I thinlg it was two months before I
could perfect any thing; and even then, but
two clumsy things in imitation of earthen jars
These, however, I very gently placed in wicker
baskets, made on purpose for them, and be-
tween the pot and the baskets, studied it full
of rice and barley straw; and these I pre~
sumed would hold my dried corn, and per. .
haps the meal, when the corn was bruised.
As for the smaller things, 1 made them with
better success; such as little round pots, flat
dishes, pitchers, and piplnns, the sun baking
them very hard.

Yet still I wanted one thing abSelntely Dc-
cessary, and that was an earthen pet, not only
to hold my liquid, but also to bear the fire,
which none of these could do. It once hap-
pened, that as I was puttingout my fire, I.
found therein a broken piece of one of my5.5)

vessels burnt hard as a rock, and red as a tile,
this made me think of burning some pots ,
and having no notion of a kiln, or of glazing
then] with lead, I fixed three large piplrins, and
we or three pots in a pile one upon another.
The fire I piled round the outside, and dry
'wood on the tep, till I saw the pots in the
inside red-hot, and found that they did not
crack at all ; and when I perceived them per-
fectly red, I let them stand in the fire live or
six hours, till the clay melted b y the extremitv
of the heat. and would have run to glass had
I sullered it: upon which, [ slat-lied my fire
by degrees, till the redness abated; and watch-
ing them till the morning, I found 1 had three
Very good pipkins, and two earthen pots, as
well burnt and fit for my turn as I could desire.
The first use to which I turned my pipkins,
~' Was to make some salt, which I had long
Wanted. F or this purpose, I filled them with
sea-water, and kept it slowly boiling over the
fire, till the whole of the water had boiled
away in steam, leaving at the bottom of the
vessel, a thin crust of salt which, I found
very good-for giving a relish to my food.
The next concern I had, was to get me a
stone-mortar to beat some corn in instead of
a mill to grind it. Hera-indeed, I was at a.
,lgreat loss, as not being-fit for a stone-cutter;
and many days I spent to find out a great
stone big enough to cut hollow and make it
fit for a mortar, and strong enough to bear the
weight of a pestle, that would brhak the corn73
without filling it with sand. But all the stonet
ot the inland9 being of a. mouldering nature,
rendered my search fruitless; and then I re-
solved to look out 101' a. great block of hard
v. ood; which having found, I termed it with mv
axe and hammer, and then with infinite labour.
made a hollow in it, just as the Indians of
Brazil make their canoes. When I had finished
this, I made a. great pestle 0t hon-wood. and
then laid th em up unaimt my succeeding
harvest.

My- next business was to make me a sieve,
to sift my meal and part it from the bran and.
husk. Having no fine thin canvass to search
the meal through, I could not tell what to do.
What linen I had was reduced to rags: 1 had
goat's hair enough, but neither tools to work it,
nor did I know how to spin it. At length. l
ra-inemhered I had some neck-cloths of calico
oz muslin, of the sailors. which I had brought
out of the ship, and with these, I made three
small N18! es proper enouu'th for the n ork.

I come now to consider the laking put. ~----
The want of an oxen lsupplied, h; making
some earthen pans, very broad, hut not deep
'Vhen I had a mind to belie, I made a great
\ tire upon my hearth, the tiles of which, I had
made mvself, and when the wood was lmrut
into lite 008315.] spread them over it, till it be-
came vets hot: then sweeping them awax, I
set down my loaves, and whelming down the
earthen pots upon them. drew the ashes and
coals all ronml the outside of the pots to

E74

continue the heat; and in this manner, I baked
my barley loaves, as well as if I had- been a
complete pastry-cook, and also made of the
rice, several cakes and puddings.

It is no wonder that all these things took me
up the best part of the year, since what inter-
mediate time 1 had, was bestowed in managing
my new harvest and husbandry; for in the
proper season, I reaped my corn, carried it
home and laid it up in the ear, in my large bas-
kets, till I had time to rub, instead of threshing
it. And now indeed, my corn encreased so
much, that it produced me twenty bushels of
barley, and as much of rice, so that I not only
began to use it freely, but was thinking how to
enlarge my barns, and resolved to sow as much
at a time as would be sufiicient for awhole
year.

All this while, the prospect of land, which I
had seen from the other side of the island, ran
in my mind. I still meditated a deliverance
from this place, though the fear of greater mis-
fortunes might have deterred me from it. For,
allowing that I had attained that place, I ran
the hazard of being killed and eaten by the de-
vouring cannibals; and if they were not so,
yet I might be slain, as other Europeans had
been, Who fell into their hands. Notwith-
standing all this, my thoughts ran continually
upon that share. 1 now wished for the long
boat with the shoulder of mutton sail. I went
to the ship's boat, that had been cast a great
way on the shore in the late storm. She Was' \ 75
removed but a little; but her bottom being
turned up by the impetuosity and surge of the
waves and wind, I fell to Iwork with all the
strength I had, and with levers and rollers
which I had cut from the wood, to turn her, and
repair the damages she had sustained. -' This
work took me up three or four weeks, when
finding my little strength all in vain, I fell to
undermining it, by digging away the sand, and
so to make it fall down, setting pieces of Wood
to thrust and guide it in the fall. But after
this was done, I was still unable to stir it up,
or to get under it, much less to move it for-
wards towards the water, and so 1 was forced
to give it over.

This disappointment,- however, 'did .not
frighten me. I began to think, whether it was
not possible for me to make a canoe or Perigua,
such as the Indians make of the trunk of a-
tree. But here I lay under particular inconve-
niences; want of tools to make it, and want of
hands to move it into the water when it was
made. However to work I went upon it, stOp-
ping all the inquiries 1 could make, with this
Very simple answer I made to myself, let's first
make it, I'll warrant I'll find some way or other
to get it along when it is done.

I first cut down a cedar-tree, which was five

' feet ten inches diameter at. the lower part next-

the stump, and four feet eleven inches diameter

at the end of twenty-two feet, after which it

lessened for a space, and then parted into.

branches. Twenty days was I hacking and
' E 276

hearing it at the bottom, fourteen more in cut-.
ting; of? the branches and limbs, and a Whole
month 111 shaping it like the bottom of a boat.
As for the inside, I was three meek s with
mallet and chisel, clearing it 111 such a manner
as that it was big enough to carry '26 men,
much bigger than an5- canoe I ever saw in my
life. and consequently suflicient to transpmt
me and all 1115* eliects to that wished tor shore,
I so ardently desired.

\Vothing remained now, but, indeed, the
greatest difficulty, to get it into the water it
lying about 100 yards t1om it. To 1e1ned5 the
ti1sto'111com emence which was a 1ising hill be-
1111 een this boat and the creek, with wonderful
pains and labour 1 <<lug into the surface of the
earth, and made a declitity. But when this
was done all the strength 1 had was as insuf.
ficient to move it, as it was when i first made
the attempt. I then proceeded to measure the
distance of ground, resolvinu to make a cana',
in 011191 to brinir the water to the canoe, since 1
could not bring the canoe to the water. [51: t
as this seemedb to be impracticable by myself
alone, under the space of eleven or twelve 5 ears
it brought me into some sort of consideration;
so that I concluded this also to be impossible,
and the attemptt-ain. I now saw, and not be-
fore, what stupidity it is to begin work befme
we reckon its cost, or iudu'e rin'htly our 01111
abilities to 0'0 through 11 ith its pertormanne.

in the 1111111111 of this w ork, my fourth year
expired from the time I was cast on this island;'9
It

At this time I did not forget my anniversary,
but kept it with rather greater devotion than
before. For now my hopes being frustrated, I
looked upon this world as athing 1 had nothing
to do with; and very well might I say, as fa-
ther Abraham said unto Dives, Between me
and [free t/zere is a gulp/r 'fi'xed. And indeed
I was separated from its wickedness toe, having
neither the lust of the flesh, the lust of the
eye, nor the pride of life; I had nothing to co-
vet, being lord, king and emperor over the
whole countryl had in possession, without dis-
pute and without controul; I had loadings of
corn, plenty of turtles, timber in abundance,
and grapes above measure. \'Vhat was all the
rest to me? the moneyI had, lay by me as
despicable dross, which I would freely have
given for a gross of tobacco pipes, or a hand-
mill to grind my corn; in a word, the nature
and eXperience of these things dictated to me
this just reflection; that the good things of
this world are no further good to us, than us
they are for our use; and that Whatever we
may heap up, we can but enjoy as much as we
use, and no more.

These thoughts rendered my mind more easy
than usual. Every time I sat down to meat, I
did it with thankfulness, admiring the provi~
dential hand of God, who in this wilderness
~ had Spread a table to me. And now I consio
dered WhatI enjoyed, rather than what I want-
ed; compared my present condition with what

1' at first expected it should be 3 how I should
E 3 -'Ii

4
have done,'if I had got nothing out of the ship;
that I must have perished before 1 had caught
fish 0}" tu1tles; or lived, had I found them, like

"a mere savage, by catintr them raw, and pulling
them to pieces with my claws, like a beast.--
I next compared my station to thatw WECha I
deserved how undutiful I had been to

'tfi; how destitute of the fear of God; yhow
101501 every thing that was good;- and how
unorateful fo1 thOSe abundant mercies I had
received from heaven, being fed, as it were, by
a 1'11i1acle, even as gre eat Elijah was fed by
ravens , and cast on a place whe1e there are no
venomous creatures to poison or devour me; in
short, making God's tender mercies matter of
great consolation, I relinquished all sadness,
arid" gave way to contentment.

As long as my ink cOntinued, which with

watv- r I made last as long as I could, I used to
minute down the days of the month on which
any remarkable thing happened.

. The next thing that wasted after my ink,

was the biscuit, which I had brought out of
~ the ship , and though I allowed myself but one
cake a day for above a twelvemonth, yet I was
quite out of bread for nearly ayear, before I
got any corn of my own. ~
in the next place my clothes began to de-
cay, and my linen had been gone long before.
However, I had preserved about three dozen
of the sailors' chequered shirts, which proved
a- fireat refreshment to me, when the violent
beams of the sun would not sufl'er me to bear

1
iam of the seamen's heaty watch coats; which
made me turn tail or, and, after 11 miserable
ootchinu manner, convert them into jackets To
prescne my head, I made a cap of goat-skins,

with thel .1air outw aids to keep out the rainfi

which indeed served me so well, that afterwards
I made a waistcoat and open kneed brecches
of the same: And then I contrived a. sortrgf
umb1ella, covering it with skins, which not
only kept out the heat of the sun, but the rain
also, Thus being easy and settled in my mind,
my chief happiness was to converse with God,
in the most heavenly and comfortable ejacula-
tions.

For five years after this. I cannot say any
extraordinary thing occurred to me. My chief
employment was to cure my raisins, and plant
my barley and rice, of both which I had a.
year's provision before hand. But though I
was dissappointed in my first canoe, I made it
at intermediate times, my business to make a.

)ears before! had finished it. But as Iper-
c011 ed it would in no Wise answe er my design of
sailing to the other shore", my thoughts were
confined to take a tour round the island, to see
what further discoveries I could make. To
this intent, after having moved her to the water
and tried how she would sail, I fitted up a
little mast to my boat, and made a sail of the

provision and mnmunition. which Wonid prca
serve them dry either from the rain, or the.
spray of the sea; and in the inside of the boat,
I cut me a long hollow place to lay my gun,
and to keep it dry, made a cover for it. My
umbrella, I fixed in a step in the stern, like a
mast, to keep oti' the heat of the sun. And
now resolving to see the circumferenceof my
little kingdom, l rictualled my ship for the
Voyage, putting in two dozen of my barley
bread loaves. an earthen pot full of parched
rice, 3. little bottle of rum, half a goat, powder
and shot, and two watch--coats. It was the 6th
of November, in the (5th year of my reign, or
captivity, that I set out on this voyage; which
was much longer than_I expected, being obliged
to put farther out, by reason of the rocks that
lay a great way in the sea.

And indeed, so much did these rocks sur-
prise me, that I was for putting back, fearing
that if 1 ventured farther, it would be out of
my power to return; in this uncertainty 1 came
to anchor just off the shore, to which I waded
with my gun on my shoulder, and then climb-
ing up a hill, which overlooked that point, I
saw the full extent of it, and so resolved to run
all hazards.

In this prospect from the bill, I perceived a
violent current running to the east,coming very
close to the point; which I the more carefully
observed, thinking it dangerous, and that when

I came to it, I might be driven into the sea by81

its force, and not able to return to the island;
and certainly it must have been so, had i not
made this observation; for on the other side
was the like current, with this difference, that
it set oifnt a greater distance ; and l perceived
there was a strong eddy under the land: so
that my chief business was to work out of the
tirst current, and conveniently get into the eddy.
Two days I staid here, the wind blowing very
briskly E. S. E. which being contrary to the
current, leaves a great brunch of the sea upon
the point; so it was neither lit for me to keep
too near the shore, on account of the breach ;
nor stand at too great a distance for fear of the
streams. That night the wind ahating, it grew
so calm, that I ventured out; and here I may
be a. monument to all rash and ignorant pilots; _
for l was no sooner come to the point, and not
above the boat's length from shore, but] was
got into a deep water, with a current like a.
mill-race, which drove my boat along so vio-
lently, that it was impossible for me to keep
near the edge of it, being forced more and
more out from the eddy to the left of me ; and
all 1 could do with my paddles was useless,
there being no wind to help me.

New 1 began to look upon myself "its quite
lost, since as the current ran on both sides of
the island, 1 was very certain they must join
again, and then I had no hopes but of perish-
.ing for want in the see, after ,what provision I

' n 582

had was spent, or before, if a storm should
happen to arise.

Who can conceive the present anguish of my
mind at this calamity 7? with longing eyes did
1 look upon my little kingdom, and thought the
island the pleasantcst place in the universe---
Happy. thrice happy desert, said I. shall I
never see thee more? \Vretched creature!
whither am I going,r ? \Vhy did I murmur
at my lonesome condition, when now [would
give the whole world to be thither again ?
'While I was thus complaining, Ifound myself
to be driven about two leagues into the sea:
however, I laboured till my strength was far
spent, to keep my boat as far north as pos-
sibly I could, to that side of the current, where
the eddy lay. About noon I perceived a lit-
tle breeze of wind spring up from the S. S. E.
which overjoyed my heart; and was still more
elated, when in about half an hour, it blew
a gentle fine gale. Had any thick weather
sprung up, I had been lost another way; for
having no compass on board, I should never
have found the way to steer towards the island,
if once it had disappeared; but it proving
the contrary, I set up my mast again, spread
my sail, and stood away northward, as much
as I could, to get rid of the current. And
no sooner did the boat begin to stretch away,
but I perceived, by the cleamess of the water,
a change of the current was near; for, where
it was strong. the water was foul; and where
it was clear, 1 1c current abated.

|_~83

Those who have been in the like calamities
with my own, mayo guess my present excess of
joy, how heartilyl ran my boat in the stream
of ttr'B eddy, and how joyfully I spread my
sail to the refreshing wind, standing cheerfully
before it, with a smart tide under foot. By the
assistance of this eddy, I was carried above a
league home again, when being in the wake of
the island, betWeen the two currents, I found
the water to be in a sort of stand. About
four o'clock in the afternoon, I reached within
a league of the island, and perceived the
points of the rock, which caused this disaster,
stretching out, as I observed before, to the
southward, which throwing oil" the current
more southerly, had occasioned another eddy
to the north. But having a fair b1isk gale,
l stretched across this eddv, and in an hour
came Within a mile of the shore, where I soon
Landed, to my unspeakable comfort; and at.
ter an humble prostration, thanking God for
my deliverance, with a resolution to lay all
thoughts of escaping aside, I brought my boat
safe to a little cove, and laid me down to take
a welcome repose \Vhen I awoke, I was
considering how I might get my boat home ,
and coasting along the shore, I came to a good
bay, which ran up to a rivulet or brook, where.
finding a harbour, I stewed her as safe as
if she:3 had been 1n a dry dock, made on pur-
pose for her.

cured of rambling to sea; yet I could wish

and pains, on this side of the island once more,
but this, indeed, was impracticable. I there-
fore began to lead a very retired life, living
nearly a twelvcmoath in a very contented man.
ner, wanting for nothing but comersation.------
As to mechanic labours, which my necessi-
ties obliged me to, l fancied 1 could, upon 0c-
casion, make a tolerable carpenter, were the
poor tools I had to work withal, but good.--
Besides, as I improved in my earthen ware, I
contrived to make them with a wheel, which I
found much easier and better, making my work
shapely, which before was rude and ugly.----
But, 1 think I never was so elevated with my
own performance or project, as when able to
make a tobacco pipe, which though it Pl'OVCd
an awkward clumsy thing, yet it was very
sound, and carried the smoke perfectly well,
to my great satisfaction.

I also improved my wicker ware, made me
abundance of necessary baskets, which, though
not very handsome, were very handy and con-
venient to fetch things home in. as also for
holding my stores, barley, rice, and other pro-
Vtsmns.as y

_ My powder. beginning to. fail, made 'me
examine after what manner I should kill the
goats or birds, to live on, after it was all gone.
Upon which, I contrived many ways to ensnare
the goats, and see if- I could catch them alive,
particularly a she-goat with young. ,~ '

At last I had my desire; for making pit- -
falls and traps, baited with barley and rice, I
found one morning 'in one of them, an old he-
goat, and in the other, three \kids, one male, I.
the other two, females.

So boisterous was the old one, that I could
not bring him away. But I.forgot the old
proverb, That Izu'nger will tame, a lion : For,
had I kept him three or four days without pro-
visions, and then given him Some water, with
a little corn, he would have been as tame as a
young kid. The other creatures I bound with
strings together; but I had- great difficulty beg.-
fore I could bring them to my habitation. It
was some time before they would feed; but
throwing them sweet corn, it so much tempted
them, that they began to be tamer. From
hence I concluded, that if I designed to furnish
myself with goat's flesh, when my ammunition
was spent, the tamely breeding them up, like
a flock of sheep, about my settlement, was the

- only method I could take. I concluded also
I must separate the wild from the tame, or /
else they would always run .Wild as - they
grew up ;_ and the best way'for this, was to

. have some. enclosed piece of ground, well

' fended, either with a hedge 'or pale, to keep

I'37

' them so eli'ectuully, that those within might
not lireak out, not those without break in.--
Such an undentaking was veryzfgreat for one
pnir of hands; but as there Was an absolute
necessity for doing it, my first care was to find
a convenient piece ofground, where [there was
likely to he herbage for them to eat, water to
drink, and cover to keep them from the sun. ,

. lzlere again, 1 gave another instance of my
ignownce and inexperience, pitching upon a
piece of meadow-land . so large, that had I
enclosed it, the hedge or pale must have been
at least two miles about. This thought came '
into my head; after] had carried it on, I be-
lieve, about fifty yards; ,1 therefore altered my
scheme, and resolved to enclose a piece of
ground, about 150 yards in length, and 100 in

- breadth, large enough for as' many as would
maintain me, till such time as my deck in-
creased, and then I could add more ground.

I now vigorously prosecuted my work, and it
took me about three months in hedging the
. first piece; in which time, I tethered the three
.kids in the best part at it;'feeding them as
near me as poseihle, to make them familiar;
tanu, indeed, I, very often'would carry some
ears of barley, or a handful of rice, and 'feed
'them out of my hand, .by which they grew
.59 tame, that when my enclOsure was finished,

' and l' had let them' lodse; they would run
alter me for a handful of com. This indeed-

, answered my end; and,- in a. year and a. half's
'tnnehl had 'a flock of about. twelve goats,

O
I88

kids: and all ; and in two years after, they
amounted to forty-three, besides what I had
killed for my sustenance.

After which, I inclo'ed the several pieces of
ground to teed them in, with pens to drive them
into, that I might take them as 1 liztd occasion.

In this project 1 likewise found additional
blessings; for I not only had plenty of goat's
flesh, but mill; too, which in the beginning, I
did not so much its think of. And, indeed,
though I had never milked a cow, much less u.
gent, or seen lmtteror cheese made, yet after
some essays and miscarriages, I made me both,
and never afterward-s wanted.

llow mercifully can the Almighty eom'ln-t
his creatures, even in the midst of their greenest
calamities? How can he sweeten the hittereat
evils, and give us reason to magnify him in dun-
geons and prisons; what a hounteous table was
here spread in a wilderness for me, where 1 ex-
peeled nothing at first, but to periih for hunger.

Certainly any one would have smiled to see
men-t dinner. There set my royu. nmjesty, an
absolute prince and ruler ol' my kingdom, ut~
tended by my dutiful subjects, whom, if I
pleased, I could either punish or reward, give
them liberty or take it away. When I dined,
I seemed a king, eating alone, none daring to

)resume to do so till I had done. Poll, as if he
had been my principnleourt favourite, was the
only person permitted to tall: with me. My old
but faithful dog, now grown exceedingly crazy,
continually sat on my right hand; while mySf:

two out; sat on each side of the tnhlo, Clipbtti-
ing a hit from my hand, as a principal mark of
my royal favour. These Were not the cats I
had brought from the ship; they had been dead
long before, and interred near my llahitution by
mine own hand. But a couple of their young I
had made tame; the rest inn wild into the woods,
and in time grew so impmlent, as to return and

1 live, wanting for nothing but conversation:--

bout; I knew not which way to get her round the
island. One time I resolved to go along the Show
by land to her; but had any one at "home met

or nmde them burst into laughter ;. nay, I could
not but smile myself at my habit, which 1 think
in this place it will be very proper to describe.

the calves of my legs. As for shoes and stock--

pearance.

But all this was of no consequence here. there
being none to observe my behaviour or habit.
And so, without fear and without controul', I
proceeded on my jouruev, the prosecution of
which took me up the or six days. I travelled

began to think of 1111111111: it in practice, the re-
11111111brance of the late danger, 511ml; me with
such honor, that I took 11110111111 resolution,
though more laborious: and this was to make

the island, and one for the other.

much stronger than a wall, and, Consequently,
inrpr><sihle tor them to break through. As for
my bower itself, I kept it constantly in repair,
and cut the trees in such a manner, as made
them grow nild, and form a most delightful
shade. In the centre of this, stood my tent,
thus erected. I had driven four piles in the
grouml, spreading over it a piece or the ship's
sail : he :eatli which. I made me anort of com-h
with the skins of the creatures I had slain, and
other things; and leaving laid thereon one of
the sailor's hlanketg which I had saved from
the wreck of the ship, and covering myself with
a great watch coat, 1 took up this place for my
country retreat.

Very frequently, from this settlement, did I
use to visit my heat, and keep her in very good
order. And, sometimes, would I venture in her
a cast or two from shore but no farther. But
now, I entreat your attention, whilst I proceed
to inform you of a new, but most surprising
scene of life which here befel me.

sion and honor, I returned to my habitation,
frightened at every hush and tree, taking every
thing for men ; and possessed with the wildest
ideas! That night my eyes never closed. I
formed nothing but the most dismal imagina-
tions. In a Word. all my religious hopes va-
nished, as though I thought God Would not
now protect me by his power, who had won-
derfully preserved me so long.

'shun one hom wh at we seek the next. This was

euident in me in the 111ostconspic11eus manner;
for I, who before had so much lamented my
condition, in being banished from all human
kind, was now ready to expire when I consi-
dered that a man had set his foot on this d. '0.
late island. But Vi hen 1 considered my station
of life, that it was allotted to me by the infinitely
wise and good p101idence of God, that I ought
not to dispute my Creator's sovereignty, who
had an undoubted right to govern and dispose of
his creatures as he thinks convenient: and that
his justice and mercy could either punish or de-
liier me: I say, when I considered all this, I95

comfortably found it my duty to trust sincerely
in him, pray ardently to him, and humbly re-
sign myself to his divine will.

One morning. lying on my bed, these words

bible to read, these words appeared in my sight;

me, as to remove all cause of sadness upon that
occasion. 1

fears, for three days and mighty I at last Ven.'

one of which we: almost spoiled for want of it.
1 next (though in great fear.) visited my bower,
and milked' my flocks there also; when, grow-
ing holder, I went down to'the shore again, and
measuring the print of the foot. to mine, to see
perhaps whether I myself had not occasioned
that mark, I found it much superior in large-
ness; and so returned home, absolutely con-
vinced, that either some men had been ashore,
or that the island must he inhabited; and, there-
fore, that I might be surprised before I was
a . 'are.

of a place of retreat upon an atmck. I now

resolved to make me 11 second one; I fell to

into frames resembling carriages. This being
'linished with indefatigable industry, for a great
way every where, I planted sticks of osier like
a wood about twenty thousand of them, leaving
a large space between them and my wall, that
I might have room to see an enemy, and that
they might not be sheltered among the young
trees, if they offered to approach the outer wall.
And indeed. scarcely two years had passed over
my head, when there appeared a lovely shady
grove, and in six years, it became a thick wood.
perfectly impassable. For my safety, I left no
avenue to go in or out; instead of which. 1 set
two ladders, one to a part of the rock which
was low, and then broke in, leaving room to
place another ladder upon that; so that when
I took these down. it was impossible for any
man to descend without hurting himself; and
it' they had, they would still be at the outside
of my outer wall. But while I took all these

measures of human prudence for my own prc- '

serration, I was not altogether unmindful of
other atlhirs. To preserve my stock of tame
goats, that the enemy should not take all at
once, I looked out for the most retired part of
the island, which was the place where I had
lost myself before mentioned, and there find-
ing a clear piece of land, containing three
acres, surrounded with thick woods, I wrought
so hard, that in less than a month's time,[
fenced it so well round, that my flocks were

FSN

\

very Well wonred in it. and l pntthereiu two
lie-goats. and ten she. ones.

All this lnhour was occasioned purely by
fearful apprehensions, on account of seeing the
print of a man's foot. And not contented yet
withwhat I had done, I searched for another
place towards the west part of the island, where
I might also retain another flock. Then wan-
during on this errand more to the west of the.
island than ererI had yet done, and casting my
eyes towards the sea, incthonghtl perceived a
boat at a great distance : but could not possibly
tell What it was for want of my spy-glass. I
considered then, it was no strange thing to see
the print of a man's foot; and concluding them
Cannibals, blessed God for being cast on the
other side of the island, where none of the
savages, as I thought ever came. But when I
came down the hill to the shore, which was the
S. \V. point of the island, I was soon confirm-
ed in my Opinion; nor can any one describe
my horror and amazement, when I saw the
ground spread with sculls, hands, feet, and
bones of human bodies; and particularly, I
perceived a space like a circle, in the midst of
which had been a fire, about which i conjec-
. tured those wretches sat, and nnnatnrally sa-
crificed and devoured their fellow creatures.

The horror and loathsomeness of this dread-
ful spectacle, both confounded my senses, and
made me discharge from my stomach in an ex-
cessive manner. I then returned towazds my.'l'l

habitation; and in my way thither. shedding
lluOt'lS of tears, and falling down on my bended
knees, gave God thanks for making my nature
contrary to those "'t'oichos, and delivering me
so long out of their hands.

Though reason and my long residence here,
had assured me, that the. savages never came
up to the thick womlyirurt of the country, and
that I had no reason to he apprehensive of a.
discovery, yet such an :lhltul't'ul.CO did I still
retain. that, t'ortwo years after, I confined my-
self only in my three plantations; I mean my
castle country seat and enclosure in the woods,
though 111 process ot time, my dreadful appre--
hensions began to wear away

Thus my circumstances for some time re.
niained very calm and undisturbed; though in--
deal. the terror which the savages had put me
in, Spoiled some inventions for my own Conve-
mew-0.. ()ne of my projects was to brew me
wine beer; a very whimsical one indeed, when
it was considered, th at I had neither casks suf~
llth" nt, nor conhl I 11121' {e am to 1 reserve it in ,
neither had I hops to make it her (p: yeast to

or nothing but howl might destroy some of
these cannihals when proceeding to their bloody
entertainmentn ; and so sawing a tltilnf from

my servant. Many were my contrivances for
this purpose. and many more, objections occur.
"0d,. after I had hatched them. I once contrived
to dig a. hole under the place Where they made
their tire, and put therein tire. or six pounds of
powder, which would consequently blow up
it" tlIUSe that were near it; but then I was lotl)
0' Spend so much upon them, lest it should not
do that certain execution I desired, and onlyr
nl'li'ight and not kill them. Having laid this de-
Sign aside, I again proposed to myself to lie pri-
vately in umhush in some convenient place, with
my three guns double loaded, nnd let fly at. them
in the midst of their dreadful ceremony: and
having killed two or three of them at every shot,
fell upon the rest sinldenly with my three ris-
tels, and let not one of them escape. This plan
appeared to me so prneticnhle that I used to
dream of it in the night time. To put my de~
sign in execution, I was not long seeking for 8.
place convenient for my purpose, where unseen
I might behold ereiy action of the savages---
Ilere l plnced my two muskets, each of which
was loaded with u hrnce of slugs, and four or
fire suntller bullets about the size of pistol bul~
lets; the foe-ling piece was charged with nearly
a handful of the largest swan shot, and in every
pistol about four bullets. And thus all things
being prepared, no sooner did the welcome light
spread over the element, but I would issue forth
from my castle, and from a lofty hill, three
miles distant, try it I could see any invadersltll

appronoh unlawfully to my kingdom. But hav-
ing waited in win two or three months. it grew
wry tiresmue to me.

I now argued with myself, it was better for
me never to attack, but to remain undiscovered
as long as I possihly could; that an opposite
conduct would certainly prove destructive; for
as it was scarcely to he supposed I could kill
them all, I might either be overpowered by the
renniining, or that some escaping might bring
thousands to my certain destruction. And, in-
deed, religion took their part so much as to con-
t'ince me how contrary it was to my duty, to be
guilty of shedding human blood, innocent as to
me in particular. whatever they are to one one>>
ther; that I had nothing to do with it, but leaVe
it to the God of all power and dominion, as I
said before, to do therein what seemed conve-
nient to his heavenly wisdom. And, therefore,
on my knees I thanked the Almighty for deli-
wring me from hlood-guiltiness, and begged his
protection that I might never fell into their
hands.

Thus giving over an attempt which I had
mshly begin n, I never ascended the hill on that
occasion afterwards; I only removed my boat,
which lay on the other side of the island, and
everything; that belonged to her, towards the
east, into a little cove, that there might not be
the least shadow of any boat near, nor habita-
tion upon the island. My castle then became

0

F0)"'13

my cell, keeping always retired in it, except
when I went out to milk my she-goats, or my
little flock in the wood, which was quite out of
danger; for sure I was, that these savages ne-
ver came here with expectation to find any
thing, and consequently never wandered from
the coast; however, as they might have several
times been on shore, as well betore as after my
dreadful apprehensions, I looked back with
horror to think in what state I might have been
had I suddenly met them, slenderly armed, with
one gun only loaded with small shot; and how
great would have been my amazement, if, in>>
stead of seeing the print of one man's tool, I
had pomeived titteen or twenty savages, who
having once set their eyes upon me, by the
swit'tness of their feet. would have left me no
possibility of escaping? These thoughts would
sink my very soul, so that I would fall into a
deep melancholy, till such time as the consi-
deration of my gratitude to the divine Being,
moved it from my heart. I then fell into a con-
templation of the secret springs of Providence;
and how wonderfully we are delivered, when
insensible of it; and when in uncertain mazes
or labyrinths of doubt or hesitation, what se-
cret hint directs us in the right way, when we
intended to go out of it; nay, perhaps contrary
to our business, sense, or inclination.
Anxieties of mind, and the care of my pre-

servation, put a period to all future inventions
and centrivances, either for accommodation, or103 '

convenience. I now cared not to drive a nail,
chap a stick. fire a gun, or make a fire, lest
either the noise should be heard, or the smoke
discover me. And on this account I used to
burn my earthen ware private] yin a cave, which
I found in the wood, and which 1 made conve-
nient for that Purpose ; the principal cause that
brought me here was to make charcoal, so that
I might bake and dress my bread and meat
without any danger.

At that time, a curious accident happened to
me, which'l shall now relate.

While 1 was cutting down some wood, for"
making my charcoal, I perceived a cavit;,r he-
hind a very thick branch of underwood. Cu-
rious to look into it, i attained its mouth, and
perceived it suiiicient for me to stand upright
in.

But when I had entered, having crept, upon
my hands and feet through this strait, I found
the roof higher up, i think about twenty feet.
But surely never had i seen such a giorious
sight hetero: the roof and walls of this care
reflected a hundred thousand lights to 110 from
my two candies, as though they were indented
with shining gold, precious stones, or sparkiiug
diamonds. And indeed it was the most deiighta
fnl cavity or grotto of its kind that could be'
desired, though entirety dark. The floor was
dry and level, and had a kind of gravel upon
it; no nauseous venomous creatures to be seen
there, neither any damp or Wet about it. I could

find no fault but in the entrance, and l hegari10-1

to .hinl 1;, that 01 en this mig ht be very necessarv
1111 11 1 defence, and therefore resolved to make
it my principal mawazine. I brought hither two
towlino pieces, and three muskets, leaving only
13111 pieces at 1n1' castle. planted in the nature
or cannon. In a. barrel of guno powder, which
i took out of the sea. I hrouoht away about
sixty pounds of good powder, thich was not
damaged; and this, 11ith a great quantity of
lead for bullets, I removed irom my castle to
this retreat. now fortified both by ant and nature.

.'1Iltl 11011 I 111 tied both the cunning and strength

me.
_ I think I was now in the twentyihird year
oi my reiun. and my thonOhts much easier than
tonnerlx, "1111111111, cont1i1ed sevelal pretty amuse-
ments and di1ersions to pass away the time 1n
a pleasant manner. B1- this time, my pretty
Poll had learned to speak English, and pro-
nounce his words very articulately and plain;
so that for many hours we used to chat together
after a 1erv familiar manner, and he lived no
lt'ss than t11'entv-six wars. My dog, which
as nineteen \'C'dlS old, sixteen of which he
l111 d 111 th 1119, had died some time ago, oi mere
1-ld age. As for 111 y cats, they multiplied so fast,
that 1 11115 forced to hill or drive them into the
121111-111, except two or three 11 hich became in};
particular favourites. Besides these. I conti-
nually kept two or three household kids about
me, which I taught to feed out of my hand,
and two more parrots which could talk indif-
ferently, and could call Robinson Crusoe, but not
so excellently as the first, by my not taking so
much pains with them. I had also seueral sea
fowls which Ihad wounded and cut their Wings;
these growing tame, used to breed among the
low trees about my castle walls, all of which
made my abode very agreeable.

But what unforeseen events suddenly destroy
the enjoyments of this uncertain state .of life,
when we least expect them! It was now the
month of December, and the particular time
in my harvest, which required my attendance
in the fields; when going out pretty early in
the morning, before it was day-light, there ap-
peared to me from the sea shore, a flaming

'ght, about two milesfrom me at the east end
of the island, where I had observed some sa-
Yagcs had been before, not on the other side,
but to my great alfiiction it was on my side of
the island. ' '

Struck with a terrible surprise, and my usual
apprehensions, that the savages would perceive
my improvements, I returned directly to my
castle, pulled the ladder after me, making all
things look as wild and natural as I possibly
could. In the next place, I put myself in a
posture of defence, loaded my muskets and pis-
tols, and committing myself to God's protec.'
tion, [resolved to defend myself till my last] Ub'

oreatll. Two hours after, impatient for intelli-
gence, 1 set my ladder up to the side of the
hill, where there was a flat place, and then pul-
ling the ladder after me, ascended to the top,
where laying myself on my belly, with my
perspective glass 1 perceived no less. than nine
naked savages, sitting round a small fire, eating
as lsupposed, human flesh, with their two canoes
hauled on shore, waiting for the flood to Carr;r
them off again. The consternation I was in
at this sight, especially seeing them near me,
was very great; but when I perceived their
coming'must he always with the current of the
ebb, I became more easy in my thoughts, be-
ing fully convinced, that I might go abroad
. with security all the time of the flood, if they
were not heforelanded. And indeed, this proved
just as I imagined; for no sooner did they all
take boat and paddle away, but the tide made
N.\V. When I saw them gone, I took two
guns upon my shoulders, and placing a couple
of pistols in my belt, with my great sword hang.
ing by iy side, I went to the hill, Where at
first 1 made a discovery of these cannibals, and
then saw there had been three canoes more of
the savages on shore at that place, which with
the rest were making over to the main land.
But nothing could he more horrid to me,
when going to the place of sacrifice, the blood,
the bones, and other mangled parts of hu~
man bodies appeared in my sight; and so fired
was I with indignation, that I was fully resolved
to use my fire arms in endeavouring to check-
' their cruel practices, though I lost my life in the
execution. It then appeared to me, that the
visits which they make to this island are not
very frequent, it being fifteen months before
they came again; but still I Was very uneasy,
by reason of the dismal apprehensions of their
surprising me unawares: nor dared I offer to
fire a gun. on that side of the island, where
they used to appear, lest taking the alarm,
they might return with many hundred canoes,
and then, God only knows in what manner
I should have made my end. Thus was I a
year or more before I saw any of these de-
vouring cannibals again.

But, to wave this, the following accident,
which demands attention, for a while diverted-
my thoughts from these cannibals.

On the 16th of May (according to my
wooden calendar) the Wind blew exceedingly
hard, accompanied with abundance of thunder
and lightning all day, and succeeded by a very
stormy night. I had gone to bed at my usual
time, but finding it impossible to sleep, I arose
and having stirred up the embers of my fire,
sat down to my Bible. Whilst I. was seriously
pondering upon it, I was suddenly alarmed
with the noise of a gun, which I conjectured-
was fired upon the ocean. Such an unusual
surprise made me start up in aminute; when.
with my ladder ascending the mountain as be.
fore, that very moment, a flash of fire pre-
saged the report of another gun, which I pre-
seutly heard, and found it was from the part of
the sea where the current drove me away, I
could not but then think, that this must be 8
ship in distress, and that these were the melan-
choly signals for a speedy deliverance. Great,
indeed, was my sorrow upon this occasion; but
my labours to assist them must have proved al-
together vain and fruitless. However, I brought
together all the dry wood that was at hand, and
making a pretty large pile, set it on tire on the
hill. 1 was certain they plainly perceived it,
by their firing another gun as soon as it began
to blaze, and after that, several more from the
same quarter. All night long, I kept up my
fire; and when the air cleared up, I perceived
something a great way at sea, directly E. but
could not distinguish what it was, even with
my glass. the weather being so very foggy OUt
at sea. However, keeping my eyes directly
fixed upon it, and perceiving it did not Stir, 1
presently concluded it must be a ship at an-
chor, and so very hasty was I to be satisfied;
that, taking my gin], I went to the S. "7. art
of the island, to the same rocks whereI lad
been formerly driven away by the current; in
which time the weather being perfectly cleared
up, to my great sorrow, I perceived the wreck
at a ship cast away upon those hidden rocks I
had found when l was out with my boat; and
which, by making a kind of eddy, were the
occasion of my preservatibn.

\Vhen I considered seriously every thing
concerning this Wreck, and could perceive ne-
room to suppose any of them saved, l cannot
explain, by any possible force of words, what
longings my soul felt on this occasion, often
breaking out in this manner. 0 that there
had been but two or three, nay, even one per-
son saved, that we might have lived together.
conversed with, and comforted one another,
and so much were my desires moved, that
when I repeated these words, " Oh! that
" there had been but one!" my hands would
clench together, and my fingers press the
palms of my hands so close, that, had an),r
soft thingheen between, they would have crush~
ed it, while my teeth would strike together,
and set against each other so strong, that it
required some time for me- to part them.

Till the last year of my being on this island,
I never knew whether or not any one had been
smed out of this ship. I had the alilictim.
some time alter, to see the corpse of a drowned
[my come on she's, at the end of the island
which was next the shipwreck; there was no-
thing on him hut a seanian's waistcoat, a pair
of open-kneed linen draWers, and a blue linen
shirt, but no particular mark to guess what
nation he was of. In his pocket were twr.
pieces of eight, and a tobacco pipe, the last\
of which I preferred much more than I did the
first. And new the calmness of the sea tempted
me to venture out in my heat to this wreck, not
only to get something necessary out of the ship,
but in hopes that some living creature might
be on board, whose life {might preserve. 'l'his

u
had such an influence up0n my mind, that ima-
mediately I went home, and prepared every
thing necessary for the voyage, carrying on
board my boat, provisions of all sorts, with
some fresh water, and a compass; so putting
off, I paddled the canoe along the shore, till I
came to the N, E. part of the island, from
Whence I was to launch into the ocean; but
here the current ran so violently, and appeared
so terrible, that my heart began'to fail me ;~
foreseeing, that if I was driven into any of
these currents, I might be carried not only out
of the reach or sight of the. island, but even
inevitably lost in the surges of the ocean.

So oppressed was I at these troubles, that 7
gave over my enterprise, sailing to a little
creek on the shore, where, stepping out, I sat
me down 'on a rising hill, very pensive and
thought-lid. I then perceived that the tide

' Was turned, and the ilOod came on, which made
it impracticable for me to go out for so many
hours. _

_ That night, Imposed myself in my canoe,
covered With my watch co'atlnstead of a blanket,
the heavens being my tester. The next morning
1 set out with the first of the tide full north, till
I ielt the benefit of the current, which carried
me at a great rate eastward, yet not with such
impetuosity as before, nor so as to take from
me all government of my canoe; so that in two
hours I came up to the wreck,'which appeared to
me a most melancholy sight. It seemed to be a
fisanieh vessel by its building, :5ka fast betweentaro rocks; her stern and quarters beaten to
pieces by the sea: her mahnmast and fore-mast
were brought ofi" by the board; that is, broken
short ofl". As I approached nearer, I perceived
a dog on board, who, seeing me coming, yelp-
ed and cried: and no sooner did I call him,
but the poor creature jumped into the sea, out
of which I took him up almost famish'ed with
hunger and thirst"; so that when I gave him a
cake of bread, no ravenous wolf could devour
it more greedily ; and he drank to that degree
of fresh water, that he would have burst him-
self had I sufiered lrirn.

T he first sight I metwith, in the ship, were
two men drowned in the cock-room or fore-
castle, inclosed in one another's arms: hence I
very probably supposed, that when the vessel
struck in the storm, so high and incessantly did
the waters Meal; in and over her, that the men
not being able to bear it, were strangled by the
constant rushing of the waves. There were
several casks of liquor, Whether wine or brandy
I could not be positive. which lay in the lower
hold, as were plainly perceptible by the ebbing
out of the water, yet were too large for me to
pretend to meddle with: likewise I perceived
several chests, which I supposed belonged to
the seamen, two of which I took into my boat,
without examining what was in them. What
became of the rest of the sailors I could not
certainly tell; and all her riches signified no-
thing at that time to any body.

Searching farther, I found a cask, containing.1' re

about twenty gallons full of'liquor, which with
some labour I got into my boat; in a cabin
were several muskets, which I let remain there ;-
but tool: away with me a great powder horn,
with about four pounds of powder in it. I
tool; also a fire shovel and tongs, with two
kettles, a copper pot to make chocolate, and a
grid-iron, all which i thought must prove high-
1y useful to me, especially the fire shovel and
tongs. And so with the cargo, accompanied by
my dog, I came away, the tide serving for tha':
purpose; and the same evening about an hour
within night, I attained the island, after the
greatest toil aml fatigue imaginable.

That night I reposed my weary limbs in
the heat, resolving the next morning to her.
hour what I had gotten, in my new founti
under-gronml grotto ; and not carry my cargo
home to my ancient castle. Having refreshed-
1-nysell', and got all my cll'ects on shore, I nerd:
proceeded to examine the particulars ;. and 90'
tapping the caslgl found the liquor to he :2.-
kind of mm, but not like what we hail at the
Brazil<. nor indeed near 90 good. At the
opening of the chests several thing? appeared.
very useful to me; for imtam'e, l hum-:1 in
one, a very line ca<e of bottles. containingtho'
finest and host sort of cordial waters; each
bottle held about three pintx', and wa< cnv'. )uslv
tipt with silver. 1 ft'tlllld also two pot: full 65'
the choicc<t <<veetmeat's, and two more which the
water had utterly spoiled. There were like-

'ise several good. Shirk, exceedingly Welcone
to me, and about one dozen and a half of white
linen hankerchiefs, and coloured neckcloths,
the former of which was useful for wiping my
face in a hot day ; and in the till, I found three
bags of money, in one of which, decently wrapt
up in apiece of paper, were six douhloons of
501'}; and some small bars and wedges of the
same metal, which I believe might weigh near
a pound. In the other chests, I only found
some clothes of very little value, and about
two pounds .of fine glazed powder, in three
flasks, kept as I believe for charging their fow-
ling pieces on any occasion, so that, on the
"'hOle I made very little of this voyage. The
money was indeed as mere dirt to me, useless
and unprofitable; all which I would have freely
parted with for two or three pair of English
shoes and stockings, things that for many years
I had not worn, exeept those which I had lately
taken ofi' the feet of the unfortunate men I found
drowned in the wreck, yet not so good as Eng-
lish shoes, either for ease or service. I found
no gold in the second chest; so concluded that
what I took from the first belonged to an officer,
the latter appearing to have a much inferior per-
son for its owner. However, as despicable as
the money seemed, I likewise lugged it to my
'cave, laying it up securely, as I did the rest
.of my cargo, and intending to seek out, and re-
turn it to the family of the unfortunate owner,
'if ever I should return to Europe: and after [
had done all this, as there was nothing more

among them: one night in Maich,hein11'therainy season, in the i'our and twentieth you: ok
my solitude, I lay down to sleep, very well in
health, without distemper, pain, or uncommon
uneasiness either of body or mind; yet not-
withstanding, I could not compose myself to
sleep all the night long. All this tedious whilei
it is impossible to express what innumerable
thoughts came into my head. I traced quite
over, the whole history of my life in miniature,
from my utmost remembrance of things till I
came to this island; and then proceeded to
examine every action and passage that had
occurred since 1 had taken possession of my
kingdom. In my reflections upon the letter, I
was comparing the happy posture of my utility.
in the beginning of my reign, to this life oi"
anxiety, fear, and concern, siiice I had disco<<
sacred the print ofa foot in the sand; and that
while I continued without apprehension l was
incapable of feeling the dread and terror 1 new
sufl'ered. How thankful rather ought Ito have
been for the knowledge of my danger, since
the greatest happiness :1 man can he possessed
of. is to have sullicient time to provide against
it? How stupendous is the goodness of l'rovi>>
deuce, which sets such narrow bounds to the
sight and knowledge of human nature, that
while men Walk in the midst of so many dun-
gers, they are kept serene and calm, by hating
the events of things hid from their eyes, and
knowing nothing of those many dangers that
surround them, till perhaps they are dissipated
and vanished away.
e <<i
About a year and a half after, one morning
early, I was very much surprized by seeing no
less than five canoes all on shore together. on
my side of the iSland, and the savages that be
longed to them all landed and out of my sight.
Upon which, much dispirited and perplexed, I
lay still in my castle; which, however, I put
in a proper posture for an attack; and, haxing
formerly provided all that was necessary, was
soon ready to enter upon an engagement, should
they attempt it. Having waited for some time,
my impatient temper would let me hear it no
longer; 1 set my guns at the foot of my ladder,
and, as usual, ascended up to the top of the hill
at two stages, standing, however, in such a
manner, that my head did not appear above the
hill, so that they could not easily perceive me :
and here, by the assistance of my perspective
glass, I observed no less than thirty in number
around a fire, feasting upon what meat they
had dressed: how they cooked it, or what it
was, I could not then perfectly tell; but they
were all dancing and capering about the flames,
using many frightful and barbarous gestures.

But while, with a curious eye, I was behold.
ing these wretches, my spirits sunk within me,
when l perceived them drag two miserable crea.
tures from the boats, to act afresh the dread.
ful tragedy, as I supposed they had done be-
fore. It was not long before one of them fell
upon the ground, knocked down, as I suppose,
with aclub or woodensword, for that was their
manner: while two or three others went imme-
diately to work, cutting him open for their
cookery, and then fell to devour him as they;
had clone the former: While the lastunhappy
captive was left by himself, till such time, as
they were ready for him. The poor creature
looked round him with a sorrowful eye, trem-
hhng at the thoughts of death; yet, seeing him-
self a little at liberty, nature, that very moment,
as it were. inspired him with hOpez oflile: He
started away from them, and ran. with incredi-
lile swiftness, along the sands, directly to that
part of the coast where my ancient and vener.
able castle stood.

You may well imagine I was dreadfully af.
frighted upon this occasion, when, as I thought,
they pursued him in a whole body, all running
towards my palace. And new, indeed, I ex~
pected, that he would certainly fly to my grove
for protection. llowever, my spirits beginning
to recover, Istill kept upon my guard; and I
now plainly perceived, there were but three
men out of the number that pursued him. I
was infinitely pleased at the swiftness with
which the poor creature ran from his pursuers,
gaining so much ground upon them, that l
plainly perceived, could he thus hold out for
half an hour, there was not the least doubt but
he would save his life from the power of his
enemies.

Between them and my castle, there was a
creek, the very same which I sailed into with
all my efi'ects from the wreck of the ship, on
the steep hanks of which I very much feared
the poor victim would be taken, if he could

a
not suim for his escape: But soon we a I out of
pain for him, when [peieeivod he made no-
thing of it, though at iull tide, but, with an
intrepid couian'e, Dspuried 011 h), the sense of
dancer, he plunged into the flood,swi1nmini;
oxer in about thi1ty strokes, and then .11 1111110,

ran with the same incredible strength and
swiftness as before. When the three pursuers
came to the creek, two of them, who I per>>
cei1 0d could not 31* im, happilv for themselves,
retmned to their Lo111pzinv,\\l1ile the other,

1:. 11h an equal courage, but much lest swiftness,

attained the other side, as though he was re.
solved never to give me; the pursuit. And
now or never, I thought was the time for me to
procure me a servant, companion or assistant:
and earnestly did I hope that Providei'ice might

permit me to he the instrument to save this poor
oreatmes life. I immediately descended my
two ladders with the O'reatest expedition; I took
up my two guns, which Isaid before were at
the bottom of them deg and,0 getting up again vuth
the same haste towards the hill I made nearer-
the sea. In aword, tah intr a sh01tcut down the
hill, 1 interposed bet tween 3the pursuer and pur-
sued, hallooing aloud to the lattei, who ventur-
ing to look back, was, no doubt, as much terri-
fled at me as at the enemy trom Whom he fled.

I beckoned to him with my hand to 1eturn back,

and in the mean time, advanced towards thsi
pursuer. I was very unwilling to fire, lest the
rest should hear, though, at that distance, I
ouestioned whether they could or no; and,
can:

.3
being out of sight of the. smoke, they could not
easily have known what to make of it. The
savage stopped as if he had been amazed:
when, advancing towards him, I could per-
ceive him take his bow from his back, and,
ai'ter fixing an arrow to it, preparing to shoot
at. me, and, without dispute, he might have
lodged it in my breast; but in this necessary
case for self-preservation, 1 immediately tired,
and shot him dead, just as his hand was going
to draw the fatal string. All this while, the
savage who had fled before, stood still, and had
the satisfaction to see his enemy killed, as he
thought. who designed to take. away his life:
so anrighted was he with the fire and noise of
my piece, that he stood as it were like Lot's
wife, fixed and iininoveahle, without-either sense
or motion. This obliged me to halloo to him
again, making the plainest signs I could to him
to draw nearer. I perceived he understood
these tokens, by his approaching to me a little
way, when, as if afraid i should kill him too,
he stopped again. Several times did he advance,
and as often step in this manner, till, coming
more to my View, I perceived him trembling,
as if he was to undergo the same fate. Upon
which, I looked upon him with a smiling coun-
tenance, and still beckoned to him; at length
he came close to me, and kneeled down, kissed
the. ground, laid his head npon it, and taking
me by the foot, set it upon his head ; which as I
understood afterwards, was a token of swearing
to be my slave for ever. I took him up,
and making much of him, encouraged him in
the best manner I could.

The greatest astonishment that my new set.
rant eoneeived, was at the manner of killing
the savage at such a distance, without a bow
and arrow : and such was his longing desire to
know it, that he first pointed to the dead ear-
euse, and then made signs to me to grant him
leave to go to it. Upon Which I bid him go,
and as well as I could, made him sensible I
granted his request. But when he came there,
how wonderfully was he struck with amaze-
ment! First, he turned it on one side, then on
another, wondering he could perceive no qua -.-
tity of blood, he bleeding inwardly: and after
sullieiently admiring the wound the bullet had
made in the breast, he took up h's how and
arrows, and came back again; upon which I
turned to go away, making signs to him to
follow, lest the rest missing their companion,
might come in pursuit of him, and this lfoimd
he understood very well, by making me to
understand that his design was to bury it, that
it might not be seen ; and which, by signs again,
1 made him sensible I very much approved of.
Immediately, he tell to work, and never was
grave digger more dexterous in the work than
he was; for in an instant, as I might say, he
scraped a large hole in the sands with his hands,
sulfieient to bury it in; there he dragged it,
and, without any ceremony, covered it over.
1 then called him away, and instead of carryingv1:111 1.li1--'-1:il.','tn> 111.1' 1':1<1l11 11'. fil'wi, i 121111111'1'1'4

rather a sort of majefity in his face; and
especially when he smiled, he had all the
sweetness of 1111 European. His hair was not
curled like wool, as many of the blacks are,
but lush" and black, with the lDOnt beautiful,
vet caieless tresses spreading over his shoul-
ders. He had a very high and 111166 forehead
with a great vivacity and sparkling sharpness in
in: eyes. His skin was not, so tawny as that

cf the Americans; but rather of a light 11111;.

\

2%!olive colour, that had something agreeable in
it, though not Very easy to give a descriptimi
of. His taee was round and plump, with at
small nose, very different from the flatness of
the negroes, a pretty small mouth, thin lips, tine
teeth, \ery well set, and uhite as the driven
snow. In a word, such handsome feutures,
{and exact symmetry in every part, made me
ronsider, that I had saved the. life of an In.
dim) prince, fora person of less dignity as I
thought, could not posses-9' such grace und
accomplislnnenis.

He had not, I thirk, slept above an hour,
When he awakened again, and While 1 we;
milking my goats hard by, out he runs from

ing himself down on the ground in the lowest
Pl'OSll'ttllon, made all the antic gestures ima>>
ginahle, to express his tliguihfulness to me for
lacing his deliverer. Ile laid down his head
again upon the ground, close to my foot, and
set my other fem, upon his liead,'a:~: he 118-4
done before, making all the signs of subjection,
shrritude, and submission imaginable, to let
me understand he would serve me as long as
his life endured. As I understood him in
many things, 1 made him sensible l was very
well pleased with him; and, iii a little time, I
lFacgzm to Speak to him, and teach him how to
tell; to me again. '

In the first place, I made him understand
11351:;th was to be Friday, because it was "1'01!PM

that day I saved his life; i then taught him to
say Master, which I made him sensinle was to
in: my name; I likewise taught him to say yes
and no, and to know what they meant, 1 game
him some milk in an earthen pot, making him
View me While I drank it before hrm. and
soaked my bread in it; I gave him a cake of
bread, and caused him to soak it likewise, to
which he readily consented, making signs of the
greatest satisfaction imaginable.

H All that night <<lid l keep him there; but no
Sumner did the morning light appear, than i
ordered him to arise and come along with me,
with certain tokens that I would give him so no
clothes like mine, at which he seemed very
glad, being stark naked, without the least
covering whatever. As we passed by the place
where the man had been interred, my man
pointed directly to his grave, showing me toe
marks that he had made to find it again, giving
me to understand by signs, that we should dig
him up and devour him. At this lappeared
extremely displeased, expressed my utmost.
abhorrence, as if I would vomit at the appre-
hensions of it, beckoning with my hand to come
away, which he did with the greatest reve-
mace and submission. After this. 1 conducted
him to the top of the hill, to View if the rest
(it the savages were yet remaining there; but
when Ilooked through my perspective glass,
1 could see no appearance of them, nor of
their canoes; so that it was very evident theyl25

never minded their deceased companion whom

We had slain ; which if they had, they would
surely have searched for, or left one boat

behind for him to follow, after he returned

from his pursuit.

Curiosity, and a desire of satisfaction, ani-
mating me with courage to see this scene of
harbarity, I took my man Friday with me to
the place of their bloody entertainment. But
when I came there, I was struck with the int.
most horror at so dreadful a spectacle, whilst
Friday was no way concerned about it, being
no doubt in his turn one of these devourers. Here
lay several human bones, there several pieces of
mangled flesh, half eaten, mangled and scorch.
ed, together with quantities of blood, which the
sun and wind had dried up. As I was musing
on this dreadful sight, Friday took all the pains
he could, by particular signs, to make me un.
derstand, that they had brought over four pri-
'soners to feast upon, three of whom they had
eaten up, and that he was the fourth, pointing
to himself, that there having been a bloody
battle between them and his great king, in
the just defence of whom he was taken pri-
soner, with many others; all of these were car--
ried off to different places to be devoured by
their conquerors; and that it was his fortune
to be brought hither by these wretches for the
very same purpose.
After I was made sensible of these things, I

caused Friday to gather those horrid remains

O
and lay them together upon a heap, which I
ordered to be sue-n fire, and burnt them to
ashes; my man, however, still retained the na-
ture of a cannibal, having a hankering stomach
alter some of the flesh , but such an ext1e111e
abhorrence did I express at the least appear.
anee of it, the: he Lluist not but conceal it: for
I made him 1131 1: sensible, the: it he attempted
am' :iuell thing, I would certainly shoot him.

1h" oeing done, I 1,0,1 r1etl my man 11 ith me,
to my castle, and gene him a pai1 of linen
d1aVe1~1wi1ieh i had taken out of the
poor gunners chest before mentioned; and.
which, VVitl12 litl; e alaereiion, fittee. him ve1y
well; in the next place 1 11121dehi1n a jerkin
of goat shin, such as my still was able to ma,
nage, and indeed I thought 1115 self then a tole-
reble good tailor. I pane him also a cap,
which I made e221 her'e s slain, Very convenient
and fashionable. 1 1111s being clothed tolerably

than I was at eeing him in it. Indeed he

My next 0011ce1'n VV as, \Vliere I she uld lodge

and yet be 1e11eetly easy 111_Vself,l erected 1:1
tent for him 111 the yacant place between my
two fortificatio11s,i11 the insule of the last. and
the outside of the first; and as them was an
entrance or door into 11iV case, Imade a for
111111 framed 3001- -case, 111111 11 door to open (In
the inside; I hmretl it up in the nighti '7

time, taking in my ladders too, so that, were
my man to prove treacherous, there could
he no way to come at me in the inside of my
innermost wall, without making so much noise
in getting over, that it must needs waken me;
for my first wall "had now a complete roof over it
of long poles, spreading over my tent, and leaning
11p to the side of the mountain, which was
again laid across with smaller sticks instead of
laths, and thatched over to a. great thickness
With the rice straw, which was as strong as
reeds; and at the hole of the place, left on pur,
pose to go in or out by the ladder, I had placed
.8- kind of a trap dobr, which if it had been
attempted on the outside, would not have
opened at all, but have fallen down, and made
a great noise; and as to my weapons, ,9?er
night I took them all to my bed side.

But there was no occasion {01' this precaug.
tion; for surely never master had a more sin-
pore, faithfhl and loving servant than Friday
proved to me. Without passion, sullennes's,
or design, perfectly obliging and engaging, his
affections, were as much tied to 1:19, as {3'58 Of
a child to his parents; and I might venture to
say. he would have laid down his life for the
saving of mine, upon any occasion whatever.
And, indeed, the many testimonies he gave 111:3
of this, sufficiently convinced me that 1 had no
nccasion to use all these precautions.

I had not been above two or three days re-
mitted to in y castie, when it became my chief
design to bring F1iday 011r from his horrid 11 ay
Hf feeding; and, to take from hnn that inhu.
1mm 11- dish he by hahit had been accustomed to:
thus I thou'rht itmy duty to let him taste other
flesh, 11' hich might the lather tempt him to the
same ahhonence, I so otten expressed against
their 0111111 wav of living. Upon which, one
Morning I took him out with 11111.,111th an in-
toution to kill a kid out of the flock, and bring
it home, and dress it. As I "as going, I per.-
ceived do. she- -goz1t lying down in the shade, and
{11 o 1'01111g' kids sittint' 111 her. Immedi-
otelv l catched hold 01p 1111' man F 1111111' and
liciding him stand still, and not stir, 1 Inc-
sented my piece and shot one of the kids.
NV poor servant, who had at a distance per-
1'1111e11111e 1:111 his ad1ersar1', and yet did not
know bv what means, or how it was done,
stood trembling and surprised, and looked so
amazed, that I thought he would have sunk
into the earth. He did not see the kid I
aimed at, orobserve I had killed it, but ripped
up his waiscoat to see if he was not 11111111111111,
thinking my resolution was to kill him; for
coming to me, he fell on his knees, earnestly
pronouncing many things which 1 did not un,
derstand the meaning ol';11'hi1h at length I
1 erceited 1'as, that 13110111111 not take away his
iitc.

Indeed so much compassion had I 101' this
creature, that it was with dithculty I refrained
from tears. But, liowcver, as, another sort of
countenance was necessary, and to convincehim that I would do him no harm, I took him,
smiling, by the hand, then laughed at him, and
pointing to the kid which I had slain, made
signs to him to fetch it, which accordingly he
did. N 0 less curious was he in viewing how
the creature was killed, than he was before in
beholding the Indian ; which, while he was ad-
miring, I charged my gun again, and presently
perceived a great fowl like a hawk, perching
upon a tree within shot; and, therefore, to let
Friday understand what I was going to do, I
called him to me again, pointing at the fowl,
which [found to be a parrot. I made him un.
derstand that I would shoot and kill that bird ;
accordingly I fired, and bade him look, when
immediately he saw the parrot fall down.
Again he stood like one amazed, notwithstand~
ing all I had said to him : and the more con-
founded he was, because he did not perceive
me put any thing in my gun. As for it in
particular, he would not so much as touch it
for several days after; but would come and
communicate his thoughts to it, and talk to it,
as if the senseless piece had understood and
answered him; all this I could perceive hzm
to do, when he thought my back was turned,
the chief intent of which was, to desire it
not to kill him, as I afterwards came to
understand.

I never strove to prevent his admiration,
nor hinder him from the comical gestures he
used on such occasrons; but when his asto-
nishment Was a little over, I made tokens to
him to run and fetch the parrot that I had
shot; which accordingly he did, staying some
time longer than usual, by reason t' rat the bird
not beino quite dead, had fluttemd some way
fa1ther from the place where she fell. In the
mean time, as he 11 as looking for 11611.1 took
the advantage of charging m y gun again, that
so I might be ready for any other mark that
offered; but nothing more occurred at the
time. So I brought home the kid, and the
same 0.1101 in:r took oil the skin. and divided the
carcase as well as I could. Pa1t of the flesh.
I stewed and boiled, in a pet I made for this
pinpose. And then, spieadinfi' my table, I
sat dow,n 0111110'1111 man some of it to eat, WI 0
11 as 11 ondc1lull1 lileased. and seemed to like
it 1e1y well: hut 11 hat was the. most suiprising
to him was to 51, 0 me eat salt with it: upon
which he made me unders.and, that the salt
was 1e1y bad {01 me; when, puttinga little
into his month, he seemed to nauseate it in such
a manner, as to spit and Spotter at it, and
then washed his mouth with fresh water: but
to show him how contrary his Opinion was to
mine. I put some meat into my mouth with-
out salt, and feigned to spit and sputter as much
for want of it, as he had done at it; yet
all this proved of no signification to Friday;
and it was a long while before he could endure
any salt in his meat or broth, and even then
but a. small quantity.
Thus, having fed. him sufficiently with boiled
meat and broth at that time, the next day Ii 3

was resolved to feast him with a roasted piece
of the kid. And having no spit to fasten it,
imrjack to tum it, I made use of that com-
mon artifice which many of the people of
England have; that is, to set two poles upon
each side of the fire, and one across on the top,
hanging the meat thereon with a string, and
so turning it round continually, till it was
sudicientl y roasted. This practice caused great
admiration in my man Friday, being quite
another way than that to which the savages
were accustmued. But when he came to taste
the sweetness and tenderness of the flesh, he
expressed his entire satisfaction in many difo'
tit-rent ways. As i could not but understand
his meaning, you may he sure I was as won--
'::eri'uily pleased. especially when he made it
:iso very plain to me, that he would never,
while he lived, cat man's flesh more.

It. was new high time I should set. my new
servant to work ; so next day [ put him 1.0
heat out some corn, and sift it in the same
manner as I had done before. And really the
fellow was very quick and handy in the execu.
tion of any thingI ordered him to go about.
Imade him understand that it was to make
bread for us to eat, and afterwards let him
see me bake it. In short, he (lid every thing
as I ordered him, in a little time, as well as I
could perform it myself.

But now, considering that I had two mouths
to feed instead of one, it was necessary that 1
should provide more ground for my harvest,
and plant a larger (plantity of corn than I.
commonly used to do; upon which I. marked
outa larger piece of land, fencing it in the
same nianner as I had done hel'ore; in the
execution of which I must give Friday this
good word, that no man could Work more
handily, or with better will than he did; and
when I made him sensible that it was for
bread to serve him as well as me. he then very
passionately made me understand, that he
thought I had much more labour on his ac.
count, than I had for myself; and that no
pains or diligence should be wanting in him,
if I would but cirect him in those Wonlis
wherein he might proceed.

I must certainly own, that this was the must
pleasant year I ever had in the island; for
after some time, Friday began to tall: pretty
well, and understood the names of those things
Which I was wont to call tor, and the places
where I used to send him. SO that my long
silent tongue, which had been so many years
unused, except when praying to God, or con-
iersing with my Poll, now began to he occu--
pied, in teaching, and talking to my man
Frida '; for indeed I had such a singular satis-
faction in the fellow himself, so innocent did his
simple and unfeigned honesty appear more and
more every day, that I really began entirely
to love him; and for his part I believe there
was no love lost, and that his nature had been. 33; i
more charmed by my exceeding Kindness_,~
and his afliections more placed upon me, than
any other object whatsoever among his own
countrymen.

I once had a great desire to try if he
had any hankering inclination to his own

him English so well, that he could give me
tolerable answers to any question which I de-
manded, I asked him, whether that nation to-
which he belonged ever conquered in battle?

he answered, yes, yes, we always fig/z! [lee bet-
ter; as much as to say, they always got the
better in light. You say, said I, that you al-
ways fight the better; why then, Friday, how
came you to be taken prisoner?

overheat them in the yonder place Where me
no was, there my nation mans beat one, two,-

.Master. Then why did not" your men re-
cover you from the hands of your enemies ?

Friday. They run one, two, or three, and.
me; they make all go into the canoe; my na-
tion have no canoe that time.

H athat is content with-what he hath. Before i
.had my servant, I thought myself miserable
itill 1 had him; and now thatl had enjoyed the
happy benefits of him, I still complained: and
Legged a deliverance from a place of retire-
ment, ease, and plenty, where Providence In
such a signal manner had blessed me. In it
word, from this time I entertained some hopes,
thatone time or other 1 might find an oppor-
tunity to make my escape from this island,
and that this poor savage might be a great
furtherance thereto.

I now began to instruct my servant, in the
saving knowledge of the true Deity, in which
the directions of God's holy Spirit assisted me.

Friday, said l, you must know, that before
this world was made, there was an Almighty
Power existing, by whose power, all things
were made, and whose nmjesty shall have no
end. To he glorified and adored by beings of
a heavenly nature, he created angels and arch-
angtds, that is, glorified spirits resembling him-
self to encompass his throne, eternally sing-
ing forth his praise, in the most heavenly
sounds and divine harmony,

1 found it easy enough to imprint the right
notions in his mind of God: for nature assisted
me in all my arguments, to Show him plainly
the necessity of a great and overruling, govern-

, ing power, of a secret directing l't'OVidele'r
end of the equity and reasonableness of Imying
.adoratien to f. ur Creator.
I then entered into a. long discourse with
him, upon the subject of the world's redempl
tion by the Saviour of it, and the doctrine of
repentance preached from heaven, together,
ivith an holy faith in our blessed Redeemer
Jesus Christ. '

' By the constant application I made of the
Scriptures, 851 read them to my maniFriday,
I earnestly endeavoured to make him under-
stand every part of them as much as lay in my
poorer. . He also, on the other hand, by his
very serious questions and inquiries, made me
a much better prolicient in Scripture know-
ledge, than I should have been by my own
private reading and study, ' '

You may well suppose, that, by the frequent
discourse "we had together, my man and I
became most intimately acquainted, and that
there was very'little that I could say, but
What Friday understood ; and indeed, he spoke
very fluently, though it'was but broken Eng-7
lisli. I now" took a particular pleasure in re-
lating all my adventures, especially those that
occurred since my being cast on this island.
I' made him understand that wonderful mys-
tery, as he conceived, of gunfiowder and
bullet, and taught him how to shoot. [also
presented'to him a knife, which pleased him
exceedingly, making him a belt, with a frog,
hanging'thereto, like those in which We Wear
hangers in England; and, instead of a hanger
$0 put'in the frog, I gaveahim' a hatchet, which

. . . H
was not nuiy as good, but even a better wea-
pon upon many occasions.

1 next gave him a very particular descrip-
tinn of my misfortune in heing shipwrecked;
showing him, as nearas I could, the place
Where the ship lay, which had been gone long
lwlore; hut l hrt'iught him to the ruins of my
heat, which, hetero, my whole strength could
not more, but now was almost rotten and
fallen to pieces. lohserred my man Friday to
View this heat with an uncommon curiosity;
which when he had done, he stood pondering
a great While, and said nothing. At last, said
1. Friday, what makes you ponder so much ?
He replied, Oman-(er, me see like [Ia/z! come to

It was some time, indeed, before I under-
stood what my man meant; but examining
strictly into it, I plainly found, that such
another boat, resembling mine, had come to
the country where he dwelt; that is to say, by
his farther explanation, that the heat was
driven there through stress of weather.

Indeed Friday answered my demands very
well, making every thing plain to my under-
standing; but beyond measure vas I satisfied
when he told me with great warmth and ar-
donr, 0 master, me save w/u'le mrms/i'om dream;
upon which 1 immediately asked him, if there

sparkling and brightness, and such a strange
eagerness, as if he:3 had a lowing desiie to be
in his O11n countiy again. '1 1119 made me not

11hat religicin I had taught him, but likewise
of the great obligation Dhe cued me for his
11ondertu1 deli erance: nay, that he would

smiled at that, and told me that he could net
swim so far. But said I, I will make a canoe
for you: Yes master, said be, me go if you
go, me 720 go if you stay. I go, Friday!

mac/z love you, that is, he vs ould tell them
how I had slain his enemies, and therehy saved
his life, for which reason he would make them
love me; and then he related to 111e, as u ell as
he was able, how exceedingly kind those of his
nation we1e to the white or bearded men, as he
called them, who In their great calamity, were
dri en into their countrv.

It was from this time, indeed, I had strong
inclinations to venture 0v er, and use my utmost
efforts, if possible, to join VsIth these white
bearded men, who undoubtedly were Spaniards
or Portuguese; for, thought I, it must he
certainly a better and safer way to escape
when there is a good companv, than for me
alone, from an island forty miles ofl' the shore,
and without any assistance. Some days after,
Friday and I being at work, as usual, at the
same time di:v erting ourselves with various
discourses, I told him I had a boat which
I would bestow upon him, whenever he
pleased to return to his own nation: and to
convmce him of the truth of what I said,
I took him with me to the other side of the
island, where my frigate lay, and then taking

* from under 1.1 ater ( for I always kept it
sunk fnr fear of a discovery) we both Went
into it to see how it would manage such an
expedition.

. And really never could any one be more
dexterous in rowing than my faithful servant,
making the boat go as fast again as I could.
\Vell, now, Friday, said I, shall we now go to
your much desired nation? But, instead of
meeting with thatcheerfulness I expected, he
looked very dull and melancholy at my saying
so; which indeed at first surprised me, till he
made me sensible, that his concern was about
the boat's being 00 small to go so far a voy-
age. Upon which, I let him understand I had
a much bigger; and, accordingly the next day
went to the place, where the first boat lay,-
which I had made, when all the strength I
had, or art I could use, failed me in my at-
tempt to get it into the water: butnow it having,
lain in the sun two and tWenty years, and no
care being taken of it all that while, it became
in a manner rotten. My man told me, that
such a boat would do very well for the pur-
pose, sufficient to carry enoug/i ez'tt/c, wring,
dread, for that was his manner of talking. In
short, my mind being strongly fixed upon my
design of going over with him to the conti~
nent, [fiery plainiy told him, that We would
both go and make a boat full as. big, and more
proportionalile than that, wherein he might
safely return to his own nation : for it occurred
to me, that most probably his great wish for a
larger boat was altogether selfish, and that
providerl' he could himself return to his cvn
country, he cared but. little What became of me.

Go your way, added 1, since you desire it,
and leave me alone by myse E, as l was before
} saved your. life.

Never was any creature more tlmmlerstruck
than Friday was at these words. 00 me away,
[care master away, said he, after a long silence,
270, 710, Friday die, Friday Zine not master
gone ; as though he had said, I neither can nor.
will live, if my master sends me from him. Fri~
day fell towards me the greatest gratitude,_and
the most sincere love; he found me not only
his (lelivercr, but his preserver and comforter;
not a severe and cruel tyrant, but a. kind, lov-
ing, and all'ahle friend. He wanted for rm-
manner of sustenance; and when he was ill,
or out of order, I was his physician, not only
for his body, but his soul; and therefore no
Wonder was it, that. such an innocent creature,
lOng- since divested of his former natural cruelty,
should have an uncommon concern at so cruel
a separation from me, which pierced him to the
very soul, and made him desire even to die,
rather than live without me.

Afterl had told Friday, in a very careless
manner, that he should he at his libertyr as.
soon as the boat was made, the language of
his eyes expressed all imaginable Confusion;
Winn, immediately running to- one of his-
hatchets, which he used to wear as a defensive
weapon, he gives it into my hand, with a heart.

_ said I, what is it you mean? What must I do

I with this ? Only kill Friday, said he, Friday

' care not live long. But what must I kill you
for, replied I again. All, dear master, w/cat
made you Friday save from eat a me up, so
keep long Friday, make Friday love God, and
now Friday send away, never see Friday more.
*And while he spoke thus, the tears ran down
his cheeks in such a plentiful manner, that I
had much ado to refrain from weeping also,
when I beheld the poor creature's affection: so
that] was forced to comfort him in the best
manner I could, which I did, by telling him,
if he was content to abide with me, I should be
ever willing to keep him.

After Friday's grief was somewhat abated,
more fully to convince me of his afi'ection, he
said, O masler, me not dare to be 2'12 my nation
leave you Izere, we desire nation [ear/2 good,
(leafs all, meaning that his desire was for the
com 613510" of that barbarous people; and that
he wished me to go with him.- And indeed,
I began to desireb to go also, f1on1 my late
discourse with Friday about these seventeen
White bearded men, that had been driven upon
the Barbarian coast; whom I designed to join,
as the only means to further our escape. To
which intent, my man and I went to search for
a proper tree to fell, whereof we might make
a perigua. or canoe, to undertake the voyage ,

nd, indeed, we were not lmg 1n finding one

t for our urpose, there being enough of

vessels, but the thing we principally Wanted:
was, to get one so near the water, that we might
~ launch it after it was finished, and not commit -
so greatw'mistake as 1- had done'once before. "
VYel'l, after a great search for what was best
and most convenient, Friday, at last, whose "l
jUdg-ment in such affairs was much Superior to. -
mine, pitches upon'a kind of wood the most '3
fitting for it. But though my man exceeded .l
Irwin-the knowledge of the most proper tree, L
yet I- showed him a much better and cleaner '
,way'to make aeanoe than ever he know before:
for he was for burning the hollow-or cavity of
the tree,,in order. to make this boat ; but 41 then '
told him how we might do it with tools, teach-
ing him at the same time how to' use them, '
which indeed he did very dexterously ;. so that
in a month's time we finished it, making it "
' very handsome, by cutting-the outsidein the\
true shape of a boat. After this,~ it took us a- ;
full fortnight before we'could>>get her. into. the *1
water, which we did, as it were, inch by inch, . '
upon great rollers:.but when she was in, she _
would have carried twenty .men, with. all, the--
ease imaginable. ,

ecz'ml. But my design was yet farther, which
he was insensihle of ; and that to make a mast
and a sail, and provide her with an anchor
and cable. As to a mast, that was no dil'lieult
thing at all to procure: so fixing upon a
straight young cedar tree, which I found near
the place, great plenty of it ahounding in the
island; and setting Friday to cut it down, I
gave him particular directions how to shape
and order it; but as to the sail, that I managed
myseit'. I very well knew I had some old ones;
or pieces of sails enough, which had lain six
and twenty years by me; but not being careful
to preserve them, as thinking I should have no
Occasion to use them any more, when I came
to look over them, I found them almost all
rotten, except two; and with these I went to
work, and after a great deal of pains and awk-
ward tedious stitching for want of needles, at
length I finished a three-cornered ugly thing,
like that we call in England. a shoulder of
mutton sail, to go with a boom at bottom, and
a small sprit at the top, like these which our
long-boats use, and which I very well knew
how to manage; especially since it was like
that which I had in my patron's fishing boat,
when with my boy Xury, I made my escape
from the barbarian shore.

Itwas nearly two months, I think, before I
completed this work. that is, the rigging, and
fitting my mast and sails; and indeed-they
were nicely done, having made a small stay,

1 9 '

-and {1' sail, or ft'zresail to it. to assist. if we
should turn to the windward; and, which was
still more, I fixed a redder to the stern of her,
to steer with; and though I was but a very
indifferent shipwright, yet, as I. was sensible
of the great usefulness and absolute necessity
of a thing like this, I- applied myself to it with
such a constant application, thutet last I ac->>
complished my design ; but what with the many
dull contrivances I had about it, and the failure
ofnieny things, it cost me as much pains in
ordering; as in making the heat. Besides,
when all this was done, 1 had my men to
teach what belonged to its navigation; for
though he very well understood how to paddle
a canoe alone, he was an utter stranger to a
sail and a rudder, and was amazed when he
saw me work the boat to and again in the sea,
by them, and how the sail jihhed and filled
this way or that way, as the course'we sailed
changed. After some time, and a little use,-
1 made all these things very familiar to him,
so that he became an expert sailor, except in-
relation to the compass, and that I could make
him, understand but little of. But as it hop...
pened, there was seldom occasion for it, there
being but little cloudy weather, and scarcely
any fog in those parts; the stars were always
visible in the night, and the shore by day, ex-
cept. in the rainy season, which confined every
one to his habitation. Thus entered into the

heat for that purpose. Butane morning as I
was very liusy upon something necessary for
1his occasion, I called' Friday to me. and bid
him to go to the seashore, andseevif he could

of the eggs, as for the sake of the flesh. He
had not been long gone, when he came running

man's way of reckoning: but on a. stricter irh
uuiry,' I found there were but three. Well,
Friday, said i, don't be terrified. l- warrant
you we will defend ourselves against theru.--------
But though I comforted him in the best manner
I could, the poor creature trembled so, that I .-
sczu'eely knew what to do with him : Omnsler,
mid he, May come look Friday, cu't pieces,
I'D-[dot], out a me up.

Why, Friday, said I, they will eat-rue up as
well as you, and my danger is as great (is

Friday then answered, Ommler, 7m? [ms-c li/i'.'

jb/'yrm, we die zc/zmyoueid (lie. 'I'hus crm>>
cluding all questions concerning his tidelit)',
I <<'u'dorcd him to take the two fo'v'Jling pieces,
which we always carried, and load them with
large swan shot, as big as small pistol lmllets ;
then I took four inuskets and loaded them with
two slugs, andtive small lmlletsench; charging
my two pistols each with a brace : I hungmy
grout sword, as custonutry. naked to my side,
and gave Friday his hatchet, as at most excel-
lent Weapon for defence.

Thus prepared, I took my pvragg-vtiio glass,
and went up to the side of the hi] , to see what
I could discover; and I perceived very soon
by my glass, that there were. one and twenty
savages, three. prisoners, and three. canoes, and
their chief conCern seemed to he the trinmp
pliant banquet upon the three poor human
bodies, a. thing which by this time I had ob-
served was very common with them. Upon
which I called to Friday : and shewing him a
greattrce, that was just at the. corner of the
weird, near which they were, I ordered him to
repair thither, and bring me word, if he could
plainly perceive their actions; accordingly, he
.did as l~ commanded him, and came back with
this melancholy story, that theyuere all about
their tire, eating the flesh of one of their pri-
soners; and that another lay hound upon the
sand, ulittle distant from them, whom they de-
signed for their next sacrifice; and this he
told me, was not one of their nation, hut one
ot'those very heardy men, who was driven by
a storm into their country, and whom he had
so often spoken to me about. You may be
sure, that upon hearing this, my soul was
ready to sink within me: when ascending up
intoatrec, 1 saw plainly, by my glass, awhite
man, who lay upon the beach of the sea, "With
hishends tied with flags or things resembling
rushes, being covered \vith clothes, and seem-
ing to he an European. From the tree where I
took this prospect, l perceived another tree,
and a. thicket beyond it, about fifty yards
nearer to them than where I was, which, by
taking: a small circle round, I might come at
undiscovered, and then lshould be within half
a shot of these 'devonrers. I therefore got -
behind some bushes. which held all the way
till' 1 came to the'other tree; and then I as-
cended to a little rising ground, not above
eighteen yards distance, and there I had a full
time of these creatures, and could perceive all
their actions.

fduch a sight did then appear, as obliged

. l 5 . ..
' me-not to 'lose .a. moment's time. 'No leis than
nineteen of~thcse cruel wretches sat upon the
ground, close huddled together, expi'essing all
the'tlelight imaginable at so barbarous an en-
tertainment; and they had just sent the other .
two to murder this poor unhappy C/arz'slz'uu,
and bring him limb by limb to their fire; for
they were then just going to untie the hands
from his feet. llereupon, immediately turning
to my man, New, Friday, said i; mind what
i say, fail in nothing, but <<lo exactly as you
see me do. All which he promising to put.
form, I set down one of my musket>>, and the
fowlingpieee upon the ground, and Friday (lid
the smite by his ; and with the, othermuslwt
I took my aim at oneof the savages, hid-
ding him to do the like: Are you ready,
said 1; Yes, master, said be, why then lire
at them, said I; and at that very moment I
gave fire likewise. , .

Let not the reader suppose that I did this

without concern. Sheekecl at the barlmrity of ~ '

thus eating their fellew--creatures, i still re-_
Elected that it was owing-to the darkness of
their minds, and that any execution l and my
man Friday madeiamong them, was semling
human souls to eternity; at the same time I
could not conceal from myself, that'it was
necessary, not only for our safesty, hut lortho
accomplishment of my object, to show them
the effect of our fire-arms, and thus- to terrify
them from resistance.
I only wounded one mortally ; but my man-
E'e'day, taking his aim much hettm' than l had,
killed two. You may he sure they were in at
dreadful consternation, at such an unexpected
disaster; and those who had yet escaped our
penetrating shot, immediately jumped upon

. their feet, but were in such a confusion, that
they knew not which way to run or look ; not
knowing from whence their destruction came.
Now, I'lrz'drw, said I,'luy down your piece, end

_ 80,_ with great courage, ' when, showing ()m'~
selves! to the sawtges, we gave a great shout,
and made directly to the poor victim, who

whom our shot had not disabled, to ju mp into
one of their canoes. By my order, F/v'rlm/
fired at them, in order to complete their com
sternation; and, for a. moment, I thought he
had killed them all, for they instantly tell to
the bottom of their boat: they soon, however,
with the exception of him whom the ball struck,
'stood up, and used their paddles with such
effect, that they were quickly out of our reach.
In the mean time, 1 cut the flags that tied the
hands and feet of the poor creature, and lifting
him up, asked him, in the "Portuguese tongue,
W/zat lie was .2 he answered me in Latin,
'(J/aristz'anus : but so very weak and faint, that
'he 'could Scarsely stand or speak. And 1 next

in him. lnnnmtiutvly l unbound him. and
would have helped him up; but he cnnld noi-
ther stand nor speak. lmtgroaned so piteonsly,
a>>: thinking he was unhound in order to be
slain. llercupon I bid Friday speak to him,
and tell him of his deliverance; when pullinU'
out my bottle, I made the poor wretch drinfi
a little, which, with the joyful news he had
i'eeeived, so revived his heart, that he sat up
in the boat. As soon as Friday began to hear
him speak, and look more fully in his face, it
would have moved any one to tears to perceive
his uncommon transports of joy; for he kissed,
embraced him, hugged him, cried, laughed,
halloUed, jumped about, danced, sung, then
cried again, Wrung his hands, beat his face
and head, then sung and jumped about again,
like a distracted creature: SO that it was 8;
greut while before 1 could make him speak to
me, or tell me what was the matter with him ;
but when he came to the liberty of his speech,
at last he told me it was his father.

Here, indeed, I was infinitely moved to see
the dutiful and tender affection which this poor
savage had to his aged parent. He would sit
down by him in the heat, open his breast, and
hold his father's head close to his bosom, half
an hour together, to cherish him; then he
took his arms and ankles, which were stiff and
numbed, with binding, and cl'iafed and rubbed
them with his hands, by which means. per-
ceiving; what the case. was, I gave him some
rum, which proved of great benefit to him.

\Vhile we were busy in this action, the
savages had gotten almost out of sight; and
happy it was we did not pursue them: for
there arose from the northwest, which con-
tinued all night long, such a violent storm, that
I could not suppose otherwise but that they
were all drowned. After this, I called Eriday
to me, and asked him, if he had given his fa-
. that any bread '8 He shook his head, apd said,
None, not one (Ill, me eat a up all ; so I gave -
him a cake of bread out-of a little pouch 1. car-
ried for this end. 1 likewise gave him two or
three bunches of raisins for his father.

Away he then runs out of the boat as if he
was bewitched, with snch an extraordinary
swiftness, that he was out of sight, as itwere,
in an instant; but, at his return, I perceived
him slacken his pace, because he had some~'
thing in his hand. And this I found to be, as,
he approached nearer, an earthen jug~ with
some water for his father, with two more cakes
of bread, which he delivered into my ,handst
Being very tl'iirsty myself, I drank some of the
water, of' which When his. father had drunk
sufficiently, it more revived his spirits than all
the rum 1 had given him.

I then called Friday to me, and ordered him
to carry the Spaniard one of the cakes, and
some Water, who \Was reposing himself upon a
green place under the shade ofa tree, but so
weak, that though he exerted himself, he cOuld
not stand upon his feet. Upon which, 'I order-ed
Friday to rub and bathe his ankles with mm, as _
he had done his father's. But every minute he
was employed in this, he would cast his eyes
towards the boat, where he left his father
sitting; who suddenly disap caring, he flew
like lightning to him, and fin ing he only laid
himself down to ease his limbs, he returned.
back to me presently, and then I spoke to the
Spaniard to let Friday help him, and led him
to the boat in order to be conveyed to my
dwelling, where I would take care of him.
Upon which. Friday took him upon his back,
and so carried him to the canoe, setting him
close by his father; and presently stepping out -
again, launched the boat oil", and paddled it
along the shore faster than I could walk, though,
the wind blew very hard too; and having
brought them safe to the creek, away he runs_
to fetch the other canoe, which he brought to
the creek almost as soon as I got to it by land;
then wafting me over, he took our new guests
out of the boat; but so weak were they, that
I was forced to make a kind of a hand-barrow;
and when I came to my castle, not being wil-
ling to make an entrance into my well, we
made them a handsome tent, covered with old . .
sails, and boughs of trees, making two good
beds of rice straw, with blankets to lie upon
and cover them. Thus, like an absolute king,
over subjects who owed their lives to me, I
thought myself very considerable. -
To get provisions for my poor Weak subjects,
I ordered Friday to kill me an yearling goat;
Which when he.had done, I cut off the binder
quarters, and chopping it into small pieces,
boiled it and stewed it, putting barley and rice
into' the broth. This I carried into their tent,
set a table, dined with them myself, and en-
couraged them. Friday was my interpreter to
his father, and indeed to the Spaniard too,
who spoke the language of the savages pretty
well. After dinner, I ordered Friday to fetch
home all our arms from the field of hattle, and
the next day to bury the dead bodies, which
he did accordingly.

And now 1 made Friday inquire of his
ether, whether he thought those -:n'ages had
escaped the late storm in their canoe; and if
so, whether they would not return with a force
too great for us to resist? He answered, that
he thought it impossible they could outlive the
storm: or it' they were driven :"-uthwardly,
they would come to a land \anlt. .Ltey would

drowned in the sea. And suppose they had
attained their own country, the strangeness of
their fatal and Moody attack, Would'make them
tell their people, that the rest of them wen-

hand of man, hut hy two heavenly Sl'lt'lbn'
<<f meaning Friday end me) who were sent from
above to destroy them. And this, he. said.
he knew, heeanse he heard them say the some.
to one another. And indeed he was in the
right on't; for] have. heard since, that thew.
very men gave out, that 'WlIUO't'Of went to that
enchanted island, would be destroyed by tire
from the gods.

No canoes appearing sometime after, as I
expected, my apprehensions ceased; instead
of which my former thoughts of a voyage took
their place, especially when Friday's [ether as.
so red me 1 should have good usage in his nation.
As to the Spaniard, he told me that sixteen more
of his countrymen, and Portuguese, who had
been shipwrecked, made their escape thither;
that though they were in union with the
savages, yet they were very miserable for want
.Uf prmisious and other necessaries, \VhenI
asked him about the particulars of this voyage,
he answered, that their ship was bound from
R ('0 dc: In Plain to the Havgmmft , that when
the ship was lost, only tive men perished in the
ocean; the rest having saved themselves in the
boat, were now landed on the main continent.
And what do they intend to do there 3' said I.
He replied, they had concerted measures to
escape by building a vessel, but that they had
neither tools nor provisions, so that all their
designs came to nothing. Supposing (said I)
I should make a proposal, and invite them
here, would they not earr ' rne prisoner to
New Spain .3 H e answered) no ; for he knew
them to be such honest men, as would scorn to
net with such inhuman bzuseness to their deli-
verer; that if I pleased, he and the old savage
would go over to them, talk with them about it,
and bring me an answer: that they should all
swear fidelity to me as their leader, upon the
holy sacrament, and, for his part, he would not
only do the same, but stand by me to the last
drop of his blood, should there be occasion.
These sulenni assurances made me resohe to162 -

grant them relief, and ,to send these two over
(for that purpose; but 'When every thing was
ready, the Spaniard raised an objection, which
.carried 'a great deal of weight in it: You know,
Sir, said he, tiaat having; been some time will:

.sz'ons, in order to execute our desz'gm

This advice of the Spanz'ard'gl approved

extreme] y 3 and so satisfied was I of his fidelity,
that I esteemed him ever after. And thus

We all' four went to iivork upon some more
land, and against seedotime, we had gotten so

much cured, and trimmed up, sufficient to" sow

22: bushels of barley on, and 16 jars of rice.

'which was in shert alljhe seed we had to spare.

As we. were four in number, and by this time

all in good health, we fearedSSnot an hundred

.of Indians, Should they venture to attack, us;
,and while .the corn was growing, I pitched
,upon some:tree's, fit to'build us a large ,vessel,

in case the'KSpanz'ards came over: which being
marked, I'ordered Friday and his father to cut
them down, appointing the Spaniard, who was

now my privy eonnSellq, to oversee and direct
the Work. \I likewiise encreased my flocks of
goats, by shooting the wild dams, and hring-
iug home their kids to my enclosure; nor did
I neglect the grape season, but cured them as .-
usual, though I had such a quantity now, as
would have filled 80 barrels with raisins.

And thus all of us being employed, they in
working, and I in providing for them, till har-
vest came, God Almighty blessed the cncrease.
of'it so much, that from twenty-two bushels
ol'lmrley, we threshed out two hundred and
twenty, and the like quantity of rice, sulfi-
cicnt to victual a ship fit to carry me and all
the Spaniards to any part of America.

Thus the principal object being answered,
by a sufficient stock of provisions, I sent my
two ambassadors over to the main land, with a
"regal authority to administer the .oath of alle.
giance and fidelity, and have an instrument
signed under their hands, though I never asked
whether they had pen, ink, or paper; when
giving each of them a musket, with eight
charges of powder and ball, and provisions
enough for eight days, they sailed away with a,
fair-gale, on a day when the moon was at the full.

Scarcely a fortnight had passed over my
head, but impatient for their return, I laid me
down to sleep one morning, when a strange -'
accident happened, which was ushered in by
my man's coming running to me, and calling
aloud, III/(slam master, t/cey are came, lfiey are
come. Upon which, not dreaming of any dan-
3593', Ollt I jump from . my bed, put on my1.64 '

Clothes, ..and hurried through my littie grove;
when looking towards the sea, 1 pcicel'vcd a
boat, about a league and a. half distant, stand-

ing in for the shore, with the Wind fair. l_

saw they did not come from the side where
the land lay on, but from the southernmost
,end' of the'island. So these being none of
lhe people We wanted, I ordered Friday to lie
still, till such timeas I came down from the
mountain, which, with my ladder I now as"
pended, in order to discover more fully what
they were; and'now, with the help of my
perspective glass, I plainly perceived an hinge
ish ship, which lconcluded'it to be, by the
fashion of its long boat; and which filled me
with such uncommon transports of joy, that I
cannot tell how to describe them; and yet
some apprehensions was mingled {with my joy,
legit any {thing should occur to make this event
different from what I hoped. I resolyed there-
fore to he on my guard.

Not long it was, before I perceived the boat
to approach the shore, es though they looked
for a place where they might conveniently land ;
and at last they ran their boat on the shore"
npon the beach, nbogrt half a mile distance;
which proved so much the happier for me, since,
had they come into the creek, they had landed
just at my door, and might not only [have
forced me outof' my castle, but plundered me
of'all I had in the world, Now I was fully
convinced they were all Englishmen, three of
whom were unarmed and bound ; when imme-
diately. the first four or five leaped on shore,
and took those three out of the boat as prison--
ers; one of whom [could perceive, used the
most passionate gestures of entreaty, affliction
and despair, while the others in a lesser degree,
showed abundance of concern.

N at knowing the meaning of this, I beckoned
to I'i'z'cquy, who was below, to ascend the mouu'~
tain. and likewise View this sight. 0 master,
said he to me, you see English mans eat pri-
soners as well as Savage mans. And do you
think they will eat them, I'iiday? said I. Yes,
said i'i'l'dzry, Meg; m! a all up. No, no. said 1*,
E'z'llnjy, I am much more concerned lest they
murder them ;- but as for eating. them up, that
I am sure they will never do.

And nor: 1 not. only lamented my misfor-
tune in not having;r the Spaniard and Swage
with me, but also that I could not come within
shot of them unperceived. (they having no fire-
urms muons; them) and save these three men,
whom I thought they were going to kill with
their swords. But some comfort it was to me,
that I perceived they were set at liberty to go

nnnhle, that the tide had ehhed so low, as to

men that were in her more circumspect; for:
having drunk a little too much iiquor, they fell
fast asleep; but one of them waking before the
other, and perceiving the boat too fast agrounif
for his strength-to move it, he halloood out to
the rest,- who made all possible expedition to

time I never stirred from my concealment. be--
irg fully sensible it could be no less than ten
,hours before the boat would beafloat, and then,
.it would be so dark, that they could not easily
perceive me, by which means I should be at
more liberty to hear theie talk, and observe all
their motions; not but that I prepared for my
defence: yet as I had another sort of enemy to
combat with, I acted with more caution. I
took two fusees 'on my shoulder, and gave. Fri-r -

goat skin, and monstrous cap, made me- look

said I, They have but two pieces, said he,
one of which is left in the boat. He also
told me, there were two enormous villains
amongst them, that were the anthers of this
mutiny, who, if they were killed or seized,
it might induce the rest to return to their obe.
dience.

When he" had given me all the satisfaction I
could desire, I gave him and his two compa.
nions each of them a gun, with powder and
ball sufficient, and firing myself, killed one at:
the Captain's enemies, and wounded the other,
who eagerly called for assistance; but the
Captain (who had reserved his pieee) coming
up to him, Sirmfi, said he, We too late to call

for assistance, you should rat/zei- cry to God (0
pardon your villainy.' and so knocked him
down with the stock of his gun: three" others
Were also slightly wounded, who, at my ep~
proach, cried out for mercy. This theCaptain
granted, upon condition that they would swear
to be true to him in recovering the ship, which
they solemnly did: however I obliged the
Captain to keep them bound. After which~
I sent Friday and the Captain's mate to secure '-
the boat and bring away the ears and sail;
when the men, seeing their late distressed Cap-
tain, now their conqueror, submitted to be
boimd also. And then it was, that having
more liberty, I related the adventures of my _
whole life, which he heard with a serious at-
tention. After this, I carried him and his two
.cempanions into my little fortified castle, show-v
ed them all my conveniences, and when this
was otrer, We began to consider about regain--
ing the ship : he said that there were. twenty>>
six hands on board, who knowing their lives
were forfeited by the law, for conspiracy and
mutiny, were so very hardened, that it would-
he dangerous for our small company to attack
them. This was a reasonable inference, in--
deed: but something we must resolve on, and
immediately put in execution: we therefore
heaved the boat upon the beach so high that
she could not shoot off at high water mark, and
broke a hole in her not easy to he stopped ; so
that all the signals they gave for the boat to
come on board were in vain. This obliged
them to send another boat ashore, with ten
men armed, whose faces the captain plainly
descried, the boatswain being the chief ofli-
cer ; but he said there were three honest lads
among them, who were forced into' the conspi.
racy. Hereupon, I gave him fresh courage.
(for I had perceived he was in concern) in the
mean while securing our prisoners, except two,
Whom we took to our assisstance, we thought
ourselves able enough to endure a battle.
\Vhen the sailors landed, and beheld their
boat in that condition, they not only hallooed,
but fired, for their companions to hear, yet
theyreceived no answer. This struck them-
with horror and amazement, thinking their
companions were murdered, they ~made as it"

they would return to the ship. it could ~p'e?'~
ceive the (.'aptain's countenance change at this,
till, ofa sudden, three men were Ordered to
- {Gulf after the heat, while-the other seven leapt
onshore, in order to search for their compa-
mmlfi ; and, indeed, they came to the brow of
the hill, near my ancient castle, from whence
they could see to a great distance in the woods,
and there shouting and hallooing till tired and
weary, they at length seated themselves under
a spreading tree. My opinion was, that no-
thing could he done till night, when} might.
use some artifice 'to get them all out of the
heat; but of a sudden they started up, and
made towards the sea-side; hereupon I or-
dered Friday and the Captain's mate to go
over the creek, and halloo as lorrd as they
Could, and so decoying them into the woods,
come round to me again. And this, indeed,
had good effect; for they followed-the noise,
till coming westward to the creel<,-the.y called
for their boat to carry them over, and taking
one of the men out of her, lefttwo to look
after her, having fastened her to the stump of
a little tree on the shore. Hereuponl'imme-
diately the Captain and our party passing the
creek out of their sight, we surprised them
hotly-by the-Captain's knocking down one and
ordering the other to surrender upon pain of
death, and who being the henestest of {them
all, sincerely joined with us. 'By -_t-his time
it was pretty late ; -when the -rest iretuming to

Atheir boat, which they Found aground in the

ran about wringing their hands, crying it was
an enchanted island, and that they should be
all murdered by spirits or devils. My. men
would willingly have fallen upon them, but i
would not agree to hazard any of our party.
But to be more certain, Friday and the Cap-
tain crawled upon their hands and feet, as near
as possible}. and, when the boatswain ap-
proached in sight, so eager was the Captain,
that he fired, and killed him on the spot: Friday
knocked down the next man, and a third ran
away. Hereupon I advanced with my whole
army; and it being dark, I ordered the man
we had surprised in theboat, to call them by
their names, and to parley with them. Accord-
ingly he called aloud, Tom. S/m'll'z, Tom
Sma'l/a.' He answered, U'lzo's l/eut; Robinsuni
answered the other. For Gods sake, Tom, emu.

laid hOId ul'hi-m, and bound him. However,
he was ordered to suhmit to the governor's
mercy, for such was I called. And so laying
down their arms, we bound them all, and seized
on their boat.
After this, the Captain expostuiated with
them, telling them that the governor was an
Englishman, who might execute them there:
.hut he thought they would .be sent to England.
liorcupon they implored the Ca tain to inter-
code for their lives, and beg-god t ey might not
he sent to England. This answered our pro-
1.iect for seizing the ship. For, after sending
them, fest bound, to the cave, I sent the Cap-
.tuln to treat with them in the governor's name,
.<,;ll'ering: them pardon if they would assist in
recovering the ship. Upon which, they all
promiwd to sztaud by him till the last drop of
their hlood ; and whoever acted treacherously
should be hanged in chains upon the beach.
They were all released on these assurances:
and then the Captain repaired to the other
heat, making his nessenger Captain of her,
and gave him four men well armed; while
himself, his mate, and five more, went in the
other boat. 13y midnight, they came within
call of the ship, when the Captain ordered
Robinson to hell her, and tell them that with
great di-flicnlgy theg,r had found the men at last.
But, while they were disoouming, the-Captain,
his: mate, and the rest entered, and knocked
down the second mate, and camcnter, secured
these that Were upon the deck, by putting
them under hatches, while the other boats
crew entered and secured the forecestle; they
then broke into the round-house, where the
mate, after some resistance, shot the pirate
Captain through the head, upon which, all the
rest yielded themselves prisoners. And thus
the ship being recovered, the joyful signal was
fired, which I heard with the greatest joy
imaginable: nor was it long before he brought
the ship to an anchor at the creek's mouth,
where coming to me unawares, T/zere, says he,
my dearest friend and a'elicerer, (lien: is your
ship, and we are your servants .' a comfort so
unspeakable, as made me swoon in his more,
while, with gratitude to heaven, we were ten-
derly embracing each other.

Nothing new remained, but to consult what
we should do with the prisoners, whom he
thought it vas not safe to take on hoard.
Ilereupon, concerting with the Captain, 1
dressed myself in one of his suits, and sending
for them, told them, that as l was going to
leave the island with all my people, if they
would tarry there, their lives should be spared;
if not, they should be hanged at the first port
they came to. They agreed to stay. Here-
uponI told them my whole story, charging
them to be kind to the Spaniards that were ex-
pected, gave them all my arms, and informing
them of every thing necessary for their subsist-
ence, I and my man Friday went on board.
