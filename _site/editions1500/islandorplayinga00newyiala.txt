PLAYING AT ROBINSON CKUSOJL 



CHAPTER I. 

LEFT TO THEMSELVES. 

R. and 
Mrs. 
Hamil- 
ton liv- 
ed in a 
very pretty house close to the 
border of a lake, in America. 
At a short distance off, there

was an island on the lake, 
and Mr. Hamilton kept a 
boat, so that very often he 
would row the children 
backwards and forwards, or 
when there was enough wind, 
they would put up a sail ; 
and when the boat had the 
sail on, and a union-jack flag 
flying at the top, you cannot 
think how pretty she looked. 
The boat was called "The 
Pretty Polly," and when she 
had just had a new coat of 
paint, 1 am sure she quite 
deserved the name. 



THE ISLAND. 7 

Mr. and Mrs. Hamilton 
had four children. First 
there was Archibald ; he was 
always called Archy, for 
short. Next came Freder- 
ick. Archy was ten years 
old, and Fred was nine. 
Then came a little girl called 
Margaret, or Maggie, who 
was between six and seven ; 
and the baby, who could on- 
ly just run alone ; and half 
the time he tumbled down 
and had to be picked up 
again; but he was a good lit- 
tle fellow, and did not often

cry. He and Moustaches, 
the Skye terrier, were great 
friends ; "but I think Mousta- 
ches was Mends with all the 
children. They would none 
of them begin to play with- 
out him, and he quite under- 
stood how to play "hide and 
seek," and would not begin 
to bark until some one called 
out " I spy I," when he would 
run after the children to catch 
them, and quite enjoy the fan. 
Moustaches was such a 
hairy little dog; you could 
scarcely see his eyes. I dare 



THE ISLAND. 9 

say you will find a portrait 
of Mm somewhere in this 
book. Everybody called him 
"Mousy," because Moustach- 
es was such a troublesome 
word to say. 

One lovely morning in Ju- 
ly, Mr. Hamilton said to the 
children, " Come here, all of 
you; I have something to 
tell you." 

He placed Archy, Fred, 
and Margaret in a row, and 
baby climbed upon his lap, 
and Mousy came up to listen

also, as if lie thought himself 
one of the family. 

Then papa said 

" Mamma and I are going 
away from home for a few 
days ; we are going to New- 
York. You must be sure 
and be very good children all 
the while we are away." 

Archy said 

" I wish I might go too." 

And baby said 

"Me go." 

"You must mind every- 
thing Jane tells you," said 
papa, 



THE ISLAND. il 

The children all nodded. 

" And you mustn't tumble 
into the water." 

"No, papa." 

"And you mustn't tumble 
out of the window." 

"No, papa." 

" And you mustn't tumble 
into the kitchen fire." 

Archy laughed, and they 
all promised that they would 
not. 

" And now run away, for I 
am going to be busy." 

The children and Mousta- 
ches all ran off; and half-an 



12 THE ISLAND. 

hour later the car came round, 
and they all came to see pa- 
pa and mamma set off. Dob- 
bin, the horse, would not 
stand still ; he kept running 
after Fred and Archy to ask 
for pieces of bread, because 
the boys were used to feed 
him. Then the carpet bags 
had to be placed in the car 
by James, the man, and 
James' face got as red as scar 
let with stooping under the 
seat to stow them away, so 
that when he rose again, Ar- 
chibald laughed, at which 



THE ISLAND. 13 

James said, " It is very rude 
of you, to laugh in that man- 
ner." And so it was. 

At length Moustaches was 
so tired of waiting for the car 
to set off, and of running back- 
wards and forwards to see if 
Mr. and Mrs. Hamilton were 
coming, that he yawned quite 
loudly to show every one that 
he was tired ; but then we do 
not expect little dogs to be 
polite, as we do little boys. 

When papa and mamma 
came out, all the children had 
to say good-bye, which took 



14 THE ISLAND. 

some little time more. How- 
ever, at length they drove 
away, leaving three of the 
children dancing fancy steps 
upon the gravel, and Archy 
running after the carriage and 
clinging on until papa called 
out in fun, " Whip behind ;" 
and Mousy barking with de- 
light, without knowing what 
he was delighted at. 

The carriage was out of 
sight, and Archy returned to 
the house. Moustaches was 
again quiet, when the chil- 



THE ISLAND. 15 

dren looked at one and the 
other and said 

" Now what shall we do ?" 

As soon as Mr. and Mrs. 

Hamilton were gone, Jane 

went into the kitchen, and 

Cook said to her 

"I will tell you what I 
think of doing ; there will be 
no dinner to serve to-day ex- 
cept the children's, and you 
can do that ; I shall just go 
down to neighbor Cole's, 
and drink tea comfortably 
there. James is going to 
drive the van to the city, and 



16 THE ISLAND. 

I am sure lie will drop me on 
the road ; wont you, James ?" 

James said Yes, of course, 
and Jane answered 

"Very well, Cook; only 
don't stop away longer than 
you can help, for you know I 
am strange here. Mind and 
come back this evening." 

Jane had only lately come 
from some distance off, and 
scarcely knew the place yet. 

Cook answered 

" Well, I will come back to- 
night, if I can; at least, if 



THE ISLAND. 17 

I am not over-persuaded to 
stay." 

So Cook set off for her 
friend's house with James, 
and Jane began to prepare 
the children's dinner. 

Now it so happened that, 
what with dancing about and 
playing, Fred became very 
hungry, and running into the 
kitchen, he asked Jane to give 
him something to eat. Jane 
was in a great hurry, for din- 
ner-time was drawing near, 
and she told him to go away 
and not to tease her ; so Fred 

2 



18 THE ISLAKD. 

seized a piece of bread which 
lay upon the kitchen table, 
and began to eat it ; but he 
soon found that he was not 
bread-hungry, so he thrust it 
into his pocket, thinking that 
it would do for Mousy, and 
then ran back into the 
garden. 

As he went he heard Archy 
calling to him 

"Fred, come here, I say; 
such fun ! We are going to 
play at 'Bobinson Crusoe;' 
~uake haste." 

Fred ran as quickly as he 



THE ISLAND. 19 

could, while Archy continued 
talking 

" I am Robinson Crusoe of 
course. Who'll be Friday ? " 

Maggie said she would be 
Friday ; but Fred objected to 
that, because of her long, light 
hair, and he would be Friday, 
and Maggie and the baby 
were to be the savages, and 
were to keep dancing qn the 
bank of the lake, while Robin- 
son and he shot at them from 
behind the bushes Mousy 
was to act the goat. 

But after a time Maggie 



20 THE ISLAND. 

and the baby got tired of act- 
ing savages and dancing on 
the strand while Crusoe and 
Friday sat comfortable in 
their cave and discussed what 
to do, or went backwards and 
forwards with the goat to 
watch their movements ; and 
they said they thought it Ar- 
chy's and Fred's turn to play 
savages; so Archy proposed 
that Maggie should be the 
English captain come to the 
island to rescue Robinson, 

He ran to untie the boat 
which was fastened up in 



THE ISLAND. 21 

the boat-house, that Maggie 
might jump in to make it 
look more real. 

Baby would have climbed 
in also, but Archy said he 
would never sit still, and 
therefore had best remain on 
the shore as a savage. 

Mousy was already in the 
boat, and Robinson Crusoe 
embraced the English Cap- 
tain, and then in a loud voice 
said good-bye to the island. 
Then calling to Friday to fol- 
low, Fred got in also, and the 
boat floated away. 



22 THE ISLAND. 

Farther and farther away, 
farther and farther from 
home, with no means of get- 
ting back again, for Archy 
had forgotten to put in the 
oars, and every moment the 
little boat floated more into 
the middle of the lake. Mou- 
sy gave a short bark, for he 
did not half like it. Archy 
and Fred looked at each oth- 
er but did not speak. After 
a time Fred said 

"We are going straight 
towards the island ; the cur- 
rent goes that way." 



THE ISLAND 23 

"All right!" said Archy; 
"we will land upon the 
island; that will be Robin- 
son Crusoe in earnest." 

The sun was very hot and 
high in the heavens, and 
Maggie had forgotten to put 
on her sun-bonnet before she 
began to play, so that she 
felt very glad when the boat 
touched the island and all the 
children jumped on to the 
land with such force that the 
poor little boat danced away 
again, and went into the mid- 
dle of the lake. 



24 THE ISLAND. 

CHAPTER H. 

THE 1ST; A 1ST*. 

OOR little ba- 
w by stood upon 
vthe sliore gazing 
after the boat 
in which were 
his brothers and 
his sister, until he became 
frightened and began to cry. 
He did not like playing sa- 
vage all by himself. Then he 
ran back to the house crying 
quite loudly, until Jane heard 
him and came out to see 




THE ISLAND. 25 

what was the matter. But 
baby could not speak much; 
and when Jane asked him 
where the others were, he 
could only say " Gar," which 
meant gone, 

" Gone ! where ?" said 
Jane. 

Baby did not know how to 
answer, and Jane felt very 
frightened, and ran to the 
spot where she had last seen 
the children. 

She did not know anything 
about the boat-house or the 
boat, *for she had been at 



26 THE ISLA1STD 

the house only a few days ; 
so, not finding the children, 
she thought they must have 
gone into the country, and 
hoped they would come back 
before long. But the dinner- 
time came and went, and of 
co' arse they did not come 
back, for they were on the 
island; and the afternoon 
passed, and evening came on, 
and Jane became very fright- 
ened. She did not like to 
leave baby alone that she 
might go and look for them, 
for she did not know whether 



THE ISLAND. 27 

he would be safe ; and baby, 
not knowing what was the 
matter, but missing his broth- 
ers and sister and Mousy, 
kept fretting all the day 
through, and could not a- 
muse himself, and would not 
eat his dinner. And neither 
Cook nor James came back 
during the day. I suppose 
Cook's friends over-persuaded 
her, as she had said they very 
likely would. 

At first, when the children 
landed upon the island, they 
ran backwards and forwards 



28 THE ISLAND. 

shouting with delight; but 
after a sboH time they became 
tired of *t\at, and walked more 
quietly and began to talk. 

"^r hat shall we do?" ask- 
ed Frea. 

" WTiYj" Archy answered, 
" We are still playing Robin- 
^n Crusoe, you know. Here, 
this little patch of grass 
amongst the bushes shall be 
our cave ; we can suppose it is 
a cave- We must begin by 
picking tip dead branches and 
m^ld^g a fire." 

" How can we make a fire ?" 



THE ISLAND. 29 

said Maggie. " We have not 
any candle to light it with." 

" Nor any matches," said 
Fred. 

" Robinson Crusoe struck a 
light by rubbing two sticks 
together," said Archy; "we 
will do the same, only first 
collect the sticks." 

Maggie and Fred gathered 
all the sticks they could find 
and carried them to the cave, 
and fixed them in a little pile. 
Archy chose two very dry 
sticks and began rubbing 
them together. He rubbed 



30 THE ISLAIO). 

for some time, but they did 
not catch fire ; then Fred took 
them and rubbed; and then 
Maggie tried, but they would 
not light. At last Archy said 
with a sigh 

" I am afraid we must do 
without a fire ; never mind, it 
is much too hot a day for 
one; we will make believe 
that it is burning." 

"I am so hungry," said 
Maggie. 

" It must be a great deal 
past dinner-time," said Fred. 

" I am sure we might find 



THE ISLAND. 31 

something to eat if we looked 
for it," Archy answered. " Let 
us all go different ways and 
search the island; we will 
meet again at this spot." 

" Maggie said she was afraid 
to go alone ; Fred felt much 
the same, but he was ashamed 
to say so; so at last it was 
agreed that they should all 
go together. 

They tied one of their pock- 
et handkerchiefs to a "bush 
near the cave, and then start- 
ed on their march. They had 
not gone far when Archy pick- 



32 THE ISLAND. 

ed up a thick heavy stick, 
which he shouldered in case 
they should be attacked by 
any dangerous beast. 

I think they must have 
wandered nearly a mile, and 
they had not found anything 
to eat, excepting a few berries. 
When first they set off they 
had chatted together, but af- 
ter a very short time they be- 
came quite silent, and walked 
with their eyes on the ground ; 
they had quite left off play- 
ing Robinson Crusoe. 

Suddenly Mousy began to 



THE ISLAND. 88 

bark. Maggie gave a cry, 
thinking that the dog had 
seen a wild beast, for nothing 
would persuade her that there 
was not lions on the island, 
and all the children stopped 
short. Mousy barked more 
and more, and kept running 
to a spot in the long grass, 
and making bites and snaps 
in the air. 

" There must be something 
alive, there," said Archy, 
shouldering his stick. 

Maggie drew close to Fred 
and trembled. It was not 

3 



34 THE ISLAim 

long before they learned the 
cause of Mousy's anger. There 
was a movement in the long 
grass, a rustling noise, and 
then there came out, hissing 
and writhing forward, a snake. 
Maggie shrieked and threw 
her arms around Fred, sobbing 
with terror, while Archy made 
a violent attack upon the ani- 
mal, beating at it with his 
thick stick, blow after blow, 
while Mousy barked louder 
than ever. It was a very 
strong snake ; it took a long 
time to kill ; but it was killed 



THE ISLAND. 35 

at last, and Archy stopped 
"beating the place and panted 
with excitement. 

When Maggie could speak, 
she said 

" I think it must be a rat- 
tle-snake." 

But Fred said 
" No ; it is a cobra." 
I do not think it was either 
the one or the other, for it 
looked very small when it was 
dead; but one would have 
thought that Archy felt at 
least a foot taller, by the way 



36 THE ISLAIOX 

he walked away from tlie 
place. 

They resumed their search 
for something to eat, but with- 
out finding anything. By this 
time the bright sky had be- 
come overcast, and the wind 
howled amongst the trees, 
and the air felt cold, so that 
poor little Maggie in her thin 
chintz frock shivered as she 
walked. 

" I think we are going to 
have a storm," said Archy; 
" perhaps we had better go 
back to the cave." 



THE ISLAND. 37 

They returned sadly to the 
place where they had tied the 
handkerchief, and sat down 
on the ground in silence. 

The wind rose higher and 
whistled more loudly through 
the trees, and large drops fell 
every now and then, so that 
the children looked about for 
some more sheltered place to 
shield them from the coming 
storm. They had scarcely 
reached a thicker part of the 
island, when the thunder 
burst upon them, and the 
lightning divided the dark 



38 THE ISLAND. 

sky in such fearful flashes, 
that Maggie screamed and 
threw herself upon her face 
upon the ground. 

Had Archy and Fred been 
a little older, they would have 
known that they were run- 
ning into more danger by 
taking shelter under the trees, 
for trees attract lightning ; but 
they did not think of that. 
Yet in all this danger into 
which they had placed them- 
selves, the lightning did not 
strike them. How was that ? 
Because the God who made 



THE ISLAND. 39 

the lightning was taking care 
of them through all the day. 
You have heard that a little 
sparrow cannot fall on the 
ground without God seeing 
it, and God loves little chil- 
dren a great deal more than 
sparrows.

CHAPTER EL 

SUNSET. 

T length 
the storm 
passed off ; 
the light- 
e ning and 
*"the thunder 
ceased, and the rain left off 
falling, but still Maggie lay 
upon the ground and did not 
speak. Poor Mousy also 
crouched down in terror at 
the noise, and whined every 




THE ISLAND. 41 

now and then. Archy went 
to his sister and raised her 
from the ground. Her little 
frock was drenched with the 
rain, her tangled hair was fall- 
en over her face, and her eyes 
were swollen with crying. 
Both Archy and Fred tried 
to comfort her, but she still 
cried and sobbed. 

" I am so cold and so hun- 
gry ; let me lie there, I had 
rather : Oh ! I wish we had 
never come ; I wish we were 
at home again ; I am sure it 
was very wicked of us to get 



42 THE ISLAND. 

into the boat without leave, 
and now we shall be starved 
and die on the island. Oh, 
papa and mamma, I wish you 
would come ! " 

And still she cried and sob- 
bed, and Archy and Fred 
could not comfort her. 

" If I only had something 
to give her to eat," said Fred ; 
" I would not so much care 
for myself." 

Suddenly he remembered, 
and placing his hand in his 
pocket drew out the piece of 
bread which he had put there 



THE ISLAISTD. 43 

in the morning, with an excla- 
mation of joy, and gave it 
to his little sister. Maggie 
would have shared it with her 
brothers, but they, like good 
little fellows, hungry as they 
were, insisted on her eating it 
herself, and walked away a 
little distance that they might 
not look at the bread too 
much. 

It is such little boys who 
make noble hearted men. 

It was past their tea-time, 
and the sun was going down. 
"With all the grief and the 



44 THE ISLAND. 

fr: r of the day, Maggie was 
getting sleepy. 

Parker and darker it grew ; 
the sun went quite down, and 
Archy sighed as he saw him 
disappear, for they thought 
they should feel more lonely 
in the dark. They chose a 
sheltered place where the rain 
had not reached, and Archy 
made his little sister lie down 
and try to sleep. He told 
Mousy to do the same, that he 
might keep Maggie warm ; 
and the child threw her arms 
round the little dog, and they 



THE ISLAND. 45 

went to bed together. Still 
Maggie could not sleep. She 
kept sobbing quietly to her- 
self, and thinking of her mam- 
ma, and wishing she were at 
home. 

Fred sat on the ground 
near his sister, and now his 
head nodded forward and his 
eyes closed, and Archy was 
left watching alone. Then in 
the darkness there came back 
to him the words that Maggie 
had said 

"I think we were very 
wicked to get into the boal 



46 THE ISLAND. 

without leave ; and now we 
shall be starved and die on 
the island." 

It was Archy who had pro- 
posed getting into the boat, 
and who had unfastened it, 
and pushed it off. He had 
led his younger brother and 
sister into the mischief. Now 
he could remember that some- 
thing had checked him when 
first he thought of it, for he 
knew his papa would not ap- 
prove of their going, but he 
had not chosen to listen to 
that " something." 



THE ISLAND. 47 

And now supposing little 
Maggie died of cold and hun- 
ger! 

Archy was greatly distress- 
ed ; he feared a return of the 
storm; he feared that more 
snakes might be hidden in the 
grass ; he feared the darkness 
which was coming on. Fred 
and Maggie were now both 
asleep and he was quite alone. 

He buried his face in his 
hands to think what amidst 
all these fears he should do. 
He did what I hope you will 
do, little children, when you 



48 THE ISLAND. 

have done wrong and are sor- 
ry for it, and when you are 
frightened and sad; he did 
what all good boys and all 
good men will do in such a 
case : he raised his head, rose, 
and then knelt to pray to God, 
to pray for help and safety. 

Then Archy took off his 
jacket and laid it over his lit- 
tle sister and Fred,^ and sat 
down again, for he did not 
like to go to sleep lest any 
more snakes should come. 

You have heard, I dare say, 
that a boat will drift different 



THE ISLAOTX 49 

ways in the water according 
to the way the wind blows. 
Now the change of wind 
turned the tide of the lake, 
and in the afternoon the boat, 
which had been tossing about 
in the middle of the water, 
tossed back again to the bank 
of Mr. Hamilton's garden, and 
there lay rubbing close up to 
the side.

was still sit- 
ting look- 
ing towards 
home, and 
Maggie and 
Fred still slept. The night 
grew more and more dark, so 
that the little boy held his 
"breath to listen to every 
sound, and started each time 
the wind moved the trees and 
bushes near him. 




THE ISLAND. 51 

At length the moon came 
out from behind a cloud, and 
threw a broad light upon the 
water. Archy saw a dark 
object rocking to and fro, and 
he remembered how the boat 
had drifted back into the 
middle of the lake, and 
thought that it must be she. 
But a little later he heard 
noises coming nearer and near- 
er, and then a grating sound, 
and then footsteps quite close. 
He did not know what it 
might be; the darkness and 
the strange place and the 



52 THE ISLAND. 

long tiring day together over- 
came him ; he felt frightened, 
and he cried aloud. 

The cry woke up Fred and 
Maggie, who started to their 
feet ; and little Moustaches, 
who began to bark; and the 
next moment the bushes 
were parted, and in the 
moonlight there stood be- 
fore all the children their 
own papa. 

At the very moment that 
Archy was asking God to 
send help to them Mr. Ham- 
ilton returned home. Only 



THE ISLAND. 53 

think how distressed both he 
and Mrs. Hamilton must have 
been when they heard from 
Jane that she could not find 
the children. Papa ran at 
once into the garden, saw the 
boat unmoored from the boat- 
house and guessed the truth. 
Oh, how anxiously he got in- 
to another boat ! how quick- 
ly he pulled to the island, 
and how eagerly he jumped 
on shore. 

You may be sure that none 
of the children were silent 
when they saw him. Maggie 



54 THE ISLAND. 

sprang into his arms, and 
Fred and Archy clung to Mm, 
and they made all the haste 
they could to get back to the 
boat. Mamma was waiting 
for them on the home side, 
and carried Maggie up to the 
house, where there was a 
bright fire to warm and dry 
them, and something was 
ready for them to eat. 

The next day, when all 
their cold and hunger and 
griefs were forgotten, Mr. 
Hamilton told Archy as they 
stood in the boat-house, that 



THE ISLAJSTD. 55 

he was now of an age to 
know right from wrong with- 
out requiring every special 
thing to be mentioned, and 
that that " something" which 
had warned him the day be- 
fore not to get into the boat 
was Conscience; and that if 
hf, would be a happy boy, 
and afterwards a happy man, 
Conscience must be obeyed.
