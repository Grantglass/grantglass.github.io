PREFACE.
This primary work is designed for small children,
and as an easy introduction to the "Progressive Intel-
lectual Arithmetic," for advanced classes.
Its object is to lead the young pupil, by brief and
simple processes, applied to practical examples of easy
gradation, to acquire habits of thought and of reasoning,
in their simplest forms, and to draw out and strengthen
the mind by a progressive and almost imperceptible gra-
dation of thought and expression.
The operations of Adding and Subtracting, of Multi-
plying and Dividing, are first shown by pictorial objects;
portions of the elementary tables are introduced at the
commencement of each lesson, and applied to short ex-
amples concerning familiar objects; promiscuous reviews
of the elementary tables, and the more simple and easy
Denominate tables have been introduced. Fractions
have been treated as far as was thought practicable
in a work of this kind.
It gives me pleasure to acknowledge my obligations
to D. W. Fish, of Rochester, N. T., a thorough, prac-
tical teacher, and who has, by my request, prepared this
little book, which, it is confidently believed, will, by its
progressive and systematic arrangement, its simplicity
and adaptation to the juvenile mind, insure for it abun-
dant success.

SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS.
§.
A teacher should have a particular time allotted
to every exercise, and regular lessons should be assigned,
to be recited each day at a specified hour.
2. Sufficient time being given the pupils to learn
their lessons, they should not be allowed the use of the
book at the time of recitation.
3. The teacher should first ascertain that the table is
thoroughly learned by every pupil in the class.
4. Each question should be slowly and distinctly read,
and the pupils be called upon promiscuously; the pupil
called upon should stand erect, repeat the question, and
then give the solution. This will require elose attention.
5. A correct and uniform analysis of each question
should be required from every pupil.
6. The class should be encouraged to deteet and cor-
rect errors in the statement and solution of questions, to
be signified by raising the hand.
7. The teacher can extend the questions in each les-
son at pleasure, either by repeating those given, or
making additional ones.

LESSON III.
Remark. — This lesson- presents the printed and
written figures, and the Roman letters, by which num-

studied by children, until they can read the figures with
facility when written on the black-board,. or when they
meet with them in books.

PROMISCUOUS EXAMPLES.
1. Henry paid 6 cents for an inkstand, 4
cents for some pens, and 5 cents for a writing
book; how much did he pay for all 1
Analysis. — He paid as many cents as the sum of 6
cents, 4 cents, and 5 cents; 6 cents and 4 cents are 10
cents, and 5 cents are 15 cents. Therefore, fyc.

1. Mr. Jones sold some hay for 7 dollars,
and received 3 dollars; how much more was

Therefore, since Mr. Jones sold some hay for 7 dollars,
and received 3 dollars, there were four dollars more due.

PROMISCUOUS EXAMPLES.
1. Oscar had 16 cents; he gave 6 cents
to a beggar, and 5 cents for an orange; how
many had he left?
Analysis. — He had left the difference between 16
cents, and the sum of 6 cents and 5 cents; 6 cents and 5
cents are 11 cents, and 11 cents from 16 cents leaves 5
cents. Therefore, SfC.

LESSON I.
Multiplication is taking one number as many times
as there are units in another: thus,
1. If 2 boys have 2 apples apiece, how many apples
will both have?
Two times two are how many?
2. If there are 3 combs in one box, how many combs
would there be in 2 boxes?
Two times three are how many?
3. If 3 men have 2 dogs each, how many dogs will

1. At 1 cent each, what will 2 eggs cost 1
Analysis. — Since 1 egg cost 1 cent, 2 eggs, which
are 2 times 1 egg, will cost 2 times 1 cent, which are 2
cents. Therefore, at 1 cent each, 2 eggs will cost 2
cents.

1. What will 2 pounds of rice cost, at 6

Analysis.— Since 1 pound costs 6 cents, 2 pounds,
which are 2 times 1 pound, will cost 2 times 6 cents,
which are 12 cents. Therefore 2 pounds of rice will
cost 12 cents, at 6 cents a pound.

PROMISCUOUS EXAMPLES.
1. When flour is 7 dollars a barrel, how
many barrels can be bought for 63 dollars 1

of 1 barrel, is contained times in 63 dollars, which are
9 times. Therefore, Sfc.

LESSON XIII.
1. How many tons of hay, at 6 dollars a
ton, will pay for 8 yards of broadcloth, at 3
dollars a yard?
Analysis. — As many tons of hay at 6 dollars a ton,
as 6 dollars, the price of a ton, is contained times in
8 times 3 dollars, or 24 dollars, the cost of the broad-
cloth, which are 4 times. Therefore 4 tons of hay, at
6 dollars a ton, will pay for 8 yards of broadcloth, at 3
dollars a yard.

LESSON XIV.
1. If 7 oranges cost 28 cents, what will 3
oranges cost?
Analysis. — If 7 oranges cost 28 cents, 1 orange
will cost as mang cents as 7 is contained times in 28,
which is 4 times; 3 oranges, which are 3 times 1 orange,
will cost 3 times 4 cente, or 12 cents. Therefore, if 7
oranges cost 28 cents, 3 oranges will cost 12 cerate.

Analysis. — She kept as many pinh as the difference
between 15 pinks and the sum of 6 pinks and 4 pinks;
6 and 4 are 10, and 10 from 15 leaves 5. Therefore,
if Isabel had 15 pinks, and gave away 10, she had 5 left.
