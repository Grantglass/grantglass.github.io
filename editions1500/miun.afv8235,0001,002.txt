THE
PREFACE..
*       HE Succefs the former Part of this
W  O R K has met with in the World,
has yet been no other, than is acknowledg'd to be due to the furpriying
Variety of the Subjelt, and to the
agreeable Manner of the Performance.
ALL the Endeavours of envious People toreproach it with being a Romance, to fearch it for
Errors in Geography, Inconfifency in the Relation,
and Contraditions in the FaE, have proved abortive, and as impotent as malicious.
TiHE jufi Application of every Incident, the
religious and ufJefl Inferences drawn from every
Part, are fo many teflimonies to the good Defign
of making it publick, and mui legitimate all the
Part that may be call'd Invention, or Parable in
the Story.
T'HE   Second Part, if the Editor's Opinion
may pats, is (contrary to the UJage of Second
Parts,) every Way cs entertaining a  the Firf,
contains aflrange and furprizing Incidents, and
a       g A z       a^




The P RE ACE.
a great a Variety of them; nor isfthe Application
les fie ious, or Jiitable; and doubtlefs wil, to the
feber, a, well a ingenious Reader, be every way as
profitable and diverting; and this makes the abridging this W  o R K,   M fandalous, as it is
knavifl and ridiculous'; feeing, while to florten
the Bock, that they may feem to reduce the Value,
they flrip it of all thofe RefleEions, as  Iell religious ta  moral, which,ire not only the greatefl
Beauties of the W     o  K, but are calculatedfor
the infinite Advantage of the R E A D E R.
BY   this they leave the Wo R K naked of its
brighteAf O;naments; and yet they would, at the
fame- time pretend, that the Author hasfupply'd
the Stoky out of his Invention, they take from it
the Improvement, which alone recominends that Invention to wife and good Men.
riHE   Injury thefe Men do to the PROPRIETOR
of this Wo R K, is a Prazlice all hone Fl Men
abhor; and he believes he may challenge them to
h)ew the Difereace between that and Robbing on the
highway, or Breaking open a Houfe.
t. iF they can't fhew any.Difference in the Crime,
they will find it hard to Phew  why there fboul4
any Djcrenco in the Pniftment: And he will
anfwer for it, that nothing fhall be wanting on
his Part, to do them yufiice.

(6)
indind -to flay at Home, and have done venturing Life
and Fortune any more,
N A   farther, the common Motive of foreign Adventures was taken away in me; for I had no   ortune to
make, I had nothing to feek: If I had gain'd ten thoufind
Pound, I had been no richer  for I had already fufficient
for me, and for thofe I had to leave it to, and that I had was
vifibly increafing for having no great Family, I could not
fpend the Income of what I had, unlefs I would fet up for
an expenllve Way of Living, fuch as agreat Family, Servants,
Equipage, Gayety, and the like, which were Things I had
no Notion of; or Inclination to; fQ that I had nothing
indeed to do, but to fit fill, and fully enjoy what I had
got, and fee it increafe daily upon my Hands.
Y E T all thefe Things ad no effec upon me, or at leaft
not enough to refill the ftrong Inclination I had to go Abroad again, which hung about me like a chronical Dijcmper; particularly the Defire of feeing my new Plantation in the Ifland, and the Colony I left there, run in my
Head contiiually. I dream'd of it all Night, and my
Imagination run upon it all Day; it was uppermoft in all
my Thoughts, and ry Fancy work'd fo fteadily and itrongly upon it, that I talk'd of it in my Sleep; in fhort, nothing could remove it out of my Mind it even broke fo
violently into all my Difcourfs, that it made my Converfation tirefome; for I could talk of nothing elie, all my
Difcourfe run into it, even to Impertinence, and I faw it
RmV felf.
I H A V.E often heard Perfons of good Judgment ay,
That all the Stir People make in the World about GhoRs
and Apparitions, is owing to the Strength of Imagination,
and the powerful Operation of Fancy in their Minds; tht
there is no fuch Thing as a Spirit appearing, or a Ghoft
walking, and the lijk  That Peoples poring affectionately
upon the paft Converfation of their deceas'd Friends, io
realizes it to them, that they are capable of fancying up
on fome extraordinary Circumffances, that they fee them;
talk to them, and are anfwered by them, when, in Truth,
there is nothing but Shadow  and Vapour in the Thing;
and they really know nothing of the Matter.
For my Par, I know not to, this Hour, whether tere
are amy fch Things as ral Apparitions, Spectres, or walk-.           iS



ing of People after they are dead, or whether there is any
Thing in the Stories they tell us of that kind, more than
the Produc  of Vapours, tick Minds, and wandring Fancies; But this I know, that my Imagination work'd up
to fuch a Height, and brought me into fuch Exccefs of
Vapours, or what elfe I may call it, that I actually fupps'd my felf, oftentimes upon the Spot, at my oldCaffle
behind the Trees; faw my old Spaniard, Friday's Father,
and the reprobate Sailors who I left upon the Ifland; nay, I
fancy'd I talk'd with them, and look'd at them fo feadily, tho' I was broad awake, as at Perfons juft before me;
and this I did, till I often righted my felf with the Images
my Fancy reprefented to me: One Time in my Sleep I had
the Villany ofthethree Pyrate Sailors, fo lively related to me
by the firif Spaniard and Friday's Father, that it was furprizing; they told me how they barbaroufly attempted to murder
all the Spaniards, and that they fet Fire to the Provifions they
had laid up, on purpofe to diftrefs and ftarve them; Things
that I had never heard of, and that yet were all of them
true in fad- And it was fo warm  in my Imagination,
and fo realizd to me, that to the Hour I faw them,
I could not be perfuaded, but that it was or would be
true; alfo how I refented it, when the Spaniards complain'd to me, and how I brought them to Juftice, try'd
them before me, and order'd them all three to be hang'd;
What there was really in this, fhall be feen in its Place:
For however, I came to form fuch things in my Dream,
and what fecret Converfe of Spirits injected it, yet tlre
was, Ijfy, very much of it true. I own, that this Dream
had; nothing in it literally and fpecifically true, but the general Part was fo true, the bafe and villanous Behaviour
of there three harden'U Rogues was fuch, and had been fo
much worfe than all I can defcribe, that the Dream had
too much Similitude of the Fat, and as I would afterwards have punifhed them4 feverely; fo if I had hang'd
them all, I had been much in the Right, and fhould a'
been juftified both by the Laws of God and Man.
BUT to return to my Story; in this kind of Temper
I had liv'd fome Years, I had no Enjoyment of my Life,
no plealant Hours, no agreeable Diverfion, but what had
metliing or other of this in it; fo that my Wife;
who aiw my mind fo wholly bent upon it, told me very
A +                ferioufly



ferioufly one Night, That he believ'd there was fbme fec-et powerful Inmpulfe of Providence upon me, which had
determin'd me to go thither again; and that fle found nothing hindered my going, but my being engag'd to a Wife
and Children. She told me, that it was true, fie could
not think of parting with me but as Ihe was affur'd, that
if fie was dead, it would be the iftf thing I would do:
So as it feem'd to her, that the thing was determin'd above, fte would not be the only Obftruction: For if I
thought fit, and refolv'd to go      Here fhe found me
very intent upon her Words, and that I look'd very earneftly at her; fo that it a little diforder'd her, and flie
Ropp'd. I ask'd her, Why fle did not go on, and fal)
out what The was going to fay? But I perceiv'd her Heart.
was too full, and fome Tears flood in her Eyes; Speak out
my Dear, faid I, Are you willing I flould go? No, fays
fhe,,very affeSionately, I am far from willing: But if you
are refolv'd to go, fays flhe, and rather than I will be the
only Hindrance, I will go with you for tho' I think it
a moIf prepoflerous thing for one of your Years, and in
your Condition, yet if it muff be, faid fhe again weeping,
I won't leaye you; for if it be of Heaven, you muff do
it, there is no refflting it i. and if Heaven makes it your:Duty to go, he will alfo make it mine to go with you,
or otherwile difpofe of me, that I may not o[flru&amp;t it.
TnIS affeedionate Behaviour of my Wife's brought me a
little out of the Vapours, and I began to confider what I
was a doing; I conrrc&amp;d my wandeiing Fancy, and began
to argue with my felf fedateiy, what bulinefs I had after
*threetcore Years, and after inch a Life of tedious Sufferings and Difalers, and clofed in fo happy and eafy a Man-. ner, I fay, what Bufinef&amp; had I to ruflf into new Hazards,
and put my:lif upon. Adventures, fit only for Youth and
* Poverty to run into.,
W I T R thofe Thoughts, I confidered' my new Engagemtent, that I had a Wife, one Child born, and my Wife
then great with Child of another that I had all the World
*could give me, and had no need to feek Hazards for Gain;
that I was declining in Years, and ought to think rather
of leaving what I had gain'd, than of feeking to increafe
it s that as to what my Wife had aid, of its being aidinl: ftom    Hav    and that it flould be my Duty t9 og,,.                 tt.



(9.)
I had no Notion of that; fo after many of thefe Cogita-;
tions, I fruggled with the Power of my Imagination,
reafon'd my hclf out of it, as I believe People may always
do in like Cafe, if they will; and, in a Word, I conquer'd
It; compos'd my fcif with fuch Arguments as occur'd to
my Thoughts, and which my prefent Condition furnilh'&amp;
me plentifully with, and particularly, as the moft effe&amp;ual
Method, I refolv'd to divert my flf with other Things,
and to engage in fome Bufinefs that might effeCdually tie
me up fiom any more Excurfions of this Kind; for I
found. the Thing. return'd upon me chiefly when I was
idle, had nothing to do, or any tling of Moment inmmediately before me,
T o this Purpofe I bought a little Farm in the County
of Bedford, and refolv'd to remove my felf thither.  had
a little convenient Houfe upon it, and the Land about it I
found was capable of great Improvement, and that it was
many ways fuited to my Inclination, which deliglhted in
Cultivating, Managing, Planting, and Improving ot Land;
and particularly, being an Inland Country, I was remov'd fi om
converiing among Ships, Sailors, and Things relating to
the remote Parts of the \Wo Id.
I N a Word, I went down to my Farm, fettled my Family, bought me Ploughs, Harrows, a Cart, Waggon, Horfes, Cows, Sheep, and fetting ferioufly to Worlk, became
in onehalf Year, a meer Country Gentleman; my Thoughts
i were intirely taken up in managing my Servants, cultivating the Ground, Enclofiin, Planting, o'c. and I liv'd, as I
thought, the moft ag'eealle Life that Nature was capable
of dmireCing, or that a Man always biedl to Misfortuncs
was capable of being ret eated to.
I FARM'D upon my own Land, I had no Rent to pay,
was limited by no Articles, I could pull ip or cut down
as I pleated: What I planted, was for my fclf, and whal  I
improvedi, was forl myFamily, and' having thus left Qff
the Thoughts of Wandering, I had not the leaft Difcomfort in any part of my Lite, as to this World,  Now
I thought indeed, that I enjoy'd that Middle State of Life,
which my Father" o earnetly recommended to m(:/ A
kind of heavenly Life, oimething like what is decridedaby
the Poet upn.the.SubjeC  of a Country Life.
-A                Free



Free from n ce, free from Care
Age has no Pin, and routh no Snare.
B   T in the Middle of all this Felicity, one Blow fiotb
*nfeen Providenceunhing'd me at once; and not only made
a Breach upon me inevitable, and incurable-; but drove me,
by its Confequence, upon a deep Relapfe into the wandering Difofition, which, as I may fiy, being born in my
very Blood, fodn recover'd its Hold of me, and like the
Returns of a violent Diftemper, came on with an irrefifitible Force upon me; b that nothing could make any
more Impreffion upon me.   This Blow was the Lofs of
my Wife.
I T is not my Buftefs here to write an Elegy upon my
Wife, give a Chara&amp;er of her particular Virtues, and make
lay Court to the Sex by the Flattery of a Funeral Serjmor.. She was, in a few Words, the Stay of all my Afifirs, the Center of all my Enterprises; the Engine, that
]by her Prudence reduc'd me to that happy Compafs I was
in, from  the moft extravagant and ruinous Project that
ittr'd; in my Head;, as above; and did more to guide my
ambling Genius, than a Mother's Tears, a Father's Infru&amp;ions, a Friend's Counfel, or all my own reafoning
bowersr culd do. I was happy in liftening to her Tears,
and iibeing moved by her Entreaties, and to the la degree
*flate and diflocated in the World by the Lofs of her.
WH ':N ifle was gone, the Worl look'd aukwardly
roundr me,; I was as mucha Stranger in it, in my Thoughts,
as I was in the Brails, when I went firft on Shore there
and as much alone, except as to the Afiftance of Servants,
as I was in my fland. I knew neither what to do, or
what not to do,. I faw the World bufy round me, one:
Part labouriug for Bread, and the other fquandering it, it
ile, Excefless or empty Pleafures; equall miferale, becaui the End they propos'd till fled from them; for the
Men of Pleafure every Day fsrfeited of their Vice, and
lea pedfu Work for Sorrow and Repentance; and the Men
of Labour fpent their Strength in daily Strugglings for
Bread to maintain the vital Strength they labour'd with;
io living in a daily Circulation of Sorrow, living but to
work, ad working but to liVe,'s if daily Bread were the
only



only End of wearinme Life, and a wearifome Life the on:
ly Occafion of daily Bread.
Tins put me in mind of the Life I lived in my Kingdom, the Ifland; where I fuffer'd no more Corn to grow.
becaufe I did not want it; and bred no more Goats, becaufe I had no more Uie for them: Where the Money
lay in the Drawer till it grew mill-dew'd, and had fcarce
the Favour to be look'd upon in 2o Years.
ALL thefe Things, had I improv'd them as I ought to
have done, and as Reafon and Religion had ditated to me,
would have taught me to fearch  rther than human Enjoyments for a full Felicity, and that there was fomething
which certainly was the Reafon and End of Life, fuperioe
to all thefe Things, and which was either to be poflie;s'
or at leaft hop'd for on this fide the Grave.
B U    T my age Counfelfor was gone  r I was like a Ship
without a Pilot, that could only run afre the Wiind  My
Thoughts run all away again into the old Affair; my Head
was quite turn'd with theWhimfies of foreign Adventures,
and all the pleafing innocent Amufements f my Farm, and
my Garden, my Cattle, and my Family, which before en-,
tirely poioeft me, were nothing to me; had no RelifR, and
were like Mufick to one that has no Ear, or Food to one
that has noTafte: In a Word, Irefolv'd to leaveoff Houfekeeping, lett my Farm, and return to London and in -
few Months after, I did fo.
W b E N I came to Lndoan, I was itillas uneafyas I waw
before I had no Relifh to the Place, no Employment ir:
it, nothing to do but to faunter about like an idle Perfon,
of whom it may be faid, he i&amp; perfetly uflefs in Od's
Creation, and it is not one Farthing matter to the reft of
his Kind, whethr he be dead or alive. This alfo was
the Thing, which of all Circumfances of Life was the
moft my Averfion, who had been all my Days ufed to an
avive Life; and I would often fay to my felf, A State
of Itdlefs it the vey Dregs of Lfe and indeed I thought
I was much more fuitably employ'd, when I was:6
Days a making me a Deal Board.
I T was now the Beginnidg of the Year 1693, when
my Nephew, who as I have obferv'd before, I had brought
up to the Sea, and had made him Commander of a Ship,.
Was coiw.Hoome from a fhort Voyage to ilbkoa, being
the



the firft he had made: He came to me, and told nme, that
fome Merchants of his Acquaintance had been propofing:to him, to; go a Voyage for them to the EafJ-Indies, and.to China, as private Traders: And now Unclk, fays he, if
yo will go to.Sea with me, I l-engage to land you upon your
od Habitation in the Ifiand, for weare to touch at theBrafils.
* N QTHi.NG can be a greater Demonftration of a future State, and of the Exiffence of an inviiible Wo Id, than
the Concurrence of fecorid Caufes, with the Ideas of
Things, which we form in our Minds, perfetly referv'd,
and not communicated to any, in the Woild.
M Y Nephew knew nothing how far my Diftemper of
wandering was return'd upon me, and I knew nothing of
wht he had in his Thoughts to fay; when that very
Morning before he came to me, I had in a great deal of
Cbn~aiion of Thought, and revolving every Part of my
Cbhcumflances in my Mind, come to, this Refolution, zij.
That L. would go to Lisbon, and confult with my old SeaCaptin; and fo if it was rational and platicable, I would
go agai fee the Ifland again, and fee what was become of my
Heople there: I had pleas'd my felf alfo with the Thoughts
of peopling. the Place, and carrying Inhabitants from hence,
gtting a. Patent for the Poffefion, and I know  not
whati when in the Middle of all this, in comes my Ne-:  ww as,Lhae faid,with his Projet of carrying- me thther, in his Way to the EaJt-Indies,:. I'   t' si a whihile  s ords, and looking ieadily
at- im, Mat, DevUil,  d  nt you of this unluck Erand
My Nephew ftartl'd as if he had been frightedat firIft
but perceiving I was not much 4ifpleafed with the Propoial, he recove'd himfclf. I.hoFe it may not be an unucky Propofal,. Sir, fiys he, I dare ify you would be
plea'i  to fee- your new Colony there, where you once
eigned witih more Felicity, than n oft o~ your Brother
~ Monarchs in.the World        -
IN a Word, the Scheme hit fo exa&amp;ly with my TemrT tibta is.to fay, with the Prepoffefilon I was under, and
of which I have faid fa much, that I told him in few
Words, if he agpred with the Merchants, I would go with
Jim: But I told hijn, I: would not promife to go any farther than my own flan&amp;    Wy; S$ir, iays he, you donit
tq t.. b eitkher e agtinn, i.hoe. Why, id I, cn you  ot
'*         t;ai:k



nt take me'up agai'nm your Return? He told me, it
could not be poffible todo fo that the Merchants would
never alloi him to come that Way with a loaden Ship of
fuclh tlue, it being a Month's Sail out of his Way, and
might.trece or tour: Befides, Sir, if I hould mifcarry,
faid he, '   not return at all, then you would be juft reduced to the Condition you were in before.
T i s was very rational but we both found out a Re,
rmedy for it, which was to carry. a framed Sloop on board
the Ship, which being taken in. Pieces, and flipp'd on
board the Ship, mght by the Helpiof firne Carpenters
who we agreed to carrywith us, be. et up again in the
Ifiand, and finin'd, fitto go to Sea in a few Days.
I w A S not long refolving; for indeed the Importunities
of my Nephew join'd in, fo effeEually with my Inclination, that nothing could oppofe me: On the other hand,
my Wife being dead, I had no body that concern'd themfelves fo muchfor me, as ito peifuade me one way or
other, except my ancient good Friend the Widow, who
earnefily ftruggled with me to confider my Years, my eaLy Circumflances, and.the needlefs Hazard of a long' VQyage; and above all my young Children: But it was all to
no Purpofe, I had an irrefilible Defire to the Voyage;
and I told her, I thought there was fomething fo unconmmon in the Impreflions I had upon my Mind for the
Voyage, that it would be a kind of refiting. Providence,
if I fiould attempt to flay at Home; after which,. fle
ceas'd her Expoftulations, and join'd with me,. not onjly in making Piovifion for my Voyage, but alib in ~et,
tling my Family A    fairs for my Abfence, and providing
for the Education of my Children.
IN, Order to this, I made my Will, and fettled the Elate I had, in fuch a Manner for my Children, and placed in fuch Hands, that I was peifealy eafy and fIrisfy'd
they would have Juflice done them, whatever might befal me; and for their Education, I left it wholly to my
Widow, with a fufficient Maintenance to her ff for her
Care: All wW ch fle richly deferv'd; for no Mother could
have taken more Care in t hir Education, or underflood
it better i ard as file liv'd till I came Home, I alo liv'd
to thank her for it.
MIY Nqllew was ready. to fail about the Beginning of

a             A94-y, i m I'with my Ma  Fidy went on
oir m the DO(Mwns the 8b, having befies that Sloop
which I mentiond above, a very c6nfiderable Cargo of
all Kinds of nec    Things for my Colony, whic   if I
did not find  good Condition, I refolvd toeav fo.
F RS T, I arried with me ome   rvants, whoI purpos'd
to place there, as Inhabitants, or at lea to fet on Work
there upon my own Account while I ftay'd, and either
to leave them there, or carry them forward as they fhould appear willing; particularly, I cy  two Carpenters, a Smith
and a very handy igenions Fellow, who was a Cooper
by trade, but was alf a general Mechanick; for he was
dextrous at making Wheels, and Hand-Mills-to grind

alfo made any Thing that was proper to make of Earth,
or of Woodj in a Word, we calfd him Our Jack of all
Trades.
W I T  the fe I carry'd a Taylor, who had ofer'd himfelf
to go Pailenger to the Eafi-Indes with my Nephew, but
afterwards connted to flay on our New Plantation, and
prov'd a molt neceflary handy Fellow, as could be dofied,
in many other Buin     beides,  s that of this Trade; for as
I obferv d formerly, Neceffityarms usforall Employments.
M Y Cargo as near as I can colle&amp;, for I have not kept
an Account of Particulars, cofied of a fufficient Q.antity of Linnen, and fome thin Englih Stuff for cloating
theSpanirds that I expeled to find there; and enoughof
them, as by my Calculation might comfortably fupply
them for.i, n Years; if I remember right, the Materials which i carry'd for cloathin  themf, with Gloves,
Hats, Shoes, Stockings, and all fuch Things as they could
want for wearing, amounted to above oo Pounds, in
cluding ibme Beds, Bedding, and Houfhold-Stuff, par â
ticularly Kitchen-Utenfil, with Pots, Kettles, Peuter,.
Brafs, &amp;c. befides, near a hundred Pounds more in IronWork, Nails, Toots of every Kind, Staples, Hooks Hinges,
and every necefTary Thing I could think of.
I CARRY'D alfo an hundrfare Arms, Muskets and Fuzees, befides fome Piftols, a confiderable Quantity ofShot
of all Sizes, three or four Ton of Lead, and two Pieces
of Brafs Cannon; and becaufe I knew not what Time,
ad wi     Extemiesa I was providing for, I carryd an
-.hundred



( Is )
hundred Barrels of Powder, befides Swords, and Cutlafles
and the Iron Part of fome Pikes, and Halberts, fo that in
fhort, we had a large Magazine of all Sorts of Stores; and
I made my Nephew carry two fmall Quarter-Deck Guns
more than he wanted for his Ship, to leave behind, if
there was Occafion; that when we came there, we might
build a Fort, and man it againfallSorts of Enemies: And
indeed, I at firft thought there would be Need enough for
it all, and much more, if we hop'd to maintain our Po~w
feffion of the Ifland, as fhall be feen in the Courfe of the
Story.
I H A D not fuch bad Luck in this Voyage, as I had been
ufed to meet with; and therefore fhall have the lefs Occafion to interrupt the Reader, who prehaps may be impaient to hear how  Matters went with my Colony; yet
fbme odd Accidents. crofs Winds, and bad Weather happen'd, on this firft fetting out, which made the Voyage
onger than I expe&amp;ed it at firft; and I who had never
made but one Voyage, (viz.) my firfi Voyage to Guinea, in
which I might be faid to come back again, as the Voyage
was at firft defign'd, began to think the fame ill Fate 1ft11
attended me; and that I was born to be never contented
with my own Shore, and yet to be always unfortunate
at Sea.
CONTRARY Winds firft put us to theNortiward, and we
were oblig'd to put in at Galwy in Ireland, where we lay
Win4-bound two and twenty Days; but we had this Sat
tisfaftion with theDifafter, that Provifions were here exceeding cheap, and in the utmoft Plenty; fo that while
we lay here, we never touch'd the Ship's Stores, but
rather added to them; here alfo I took feveral live Hogs,
and two Cows with their Calves, which I reflvd, if I
had a good Paffage, to put on Shore in my Ifland, but we
found Occafion to difpofe otherwife of them.
W E fet out the fth of Febrtary from Ireland and had
a very fair Gale of Wind for fome Days; as I remember,
it might be about the 2oth of February in the Evening
late, when the Mate having the Watch, came into the
Round-houfe, and told us, he faw a Flahf of Fire, and
heard a Gun fir'd, and while he was telling us of it, a Boy
came in, and told us the Boatfwain heaird another. This
made us all run out upon the Quarter-Deck, where for a
while



while we heard nothing, but in a few Minutes we fiw a
'very great Light, and found that there wasfome veryterrible Fire at a Diftance; immediately we had recourfe to
our Reckonings, in which we all areed, that there could
be no Land that Way, in which the Fire fhew'd it felf,
no not for 5'oo Leagues, for it appear'd at W. 'N. W.
Upon this we concluded, it muft be fome Ship on Fire at
Sea, and as by our hearing the Noife of Guns juft before,
we concluded it could not be far off: We flood direcly
towards it, and were prefently fitisfy'd we fhould difcover
it, becaufe the farther we fail'd, the greater the Light appear'd, tho' the Weather being haizy, We could not perceive any Thing but the Light for a while: In about half
an Hourms Sailing, the.Win bein fair for us, tho' not much
of it,and'the Weather clearing up a ittle, we could plainly difcern that it was a great Ship on fire in the Middle of the Sea.
I was mo-f feniibly touch'd with this Difalter tho' not
at all acquainted with the Peribns engag'd in it; I prefently recolleted my formed Circumftances, in what Condition I was in, when taken up by the Portugal Captain
and how much more deplorable the Circumfiances of the.
poor Creatures belonging to this Ship muft be, if they
had no other Ship in Company with them: Upon this,
I immediatly-order'd, that five Guns fl1ould be fr'd, one
foon after another, that, if poflble, we might give Notice to them, that there was Help for them at hand, and
that they might endeavour to fave themselves in their
Boat; or tho' we could fee the Flame of the Ship, yet
they, it being Night, could fee nothing of us.
W E lay by fome Time upon thsS, only driving:as the
-iurning Ship drove, waiting for )ay-light; -whlen on a
fuldden, to our great Terror, though we had Reafon to
expeat it, the Ship blew up in the Air; and immediate,
that is to fay, in a few Minutes, all the Fire was ou0t*
that is to fay, the refl of the. Ship funk: This was
a Terrible, and indeed an affli&amp;ing Sight, for the Sake of
tie poor Men, who, I concluded, mult be either all deftroy'd in the Ship, or be in the utmoft Dilhtfs in, their
Boats in the Middle of the Ocean, which at prefent, by
Reafon it was dark, I could not fee: Ilowever, to diuel
them as well as I could, I caued Lights to be hung out
t, all i the Parts of the Ship whee we couldl and which





attoo-k-te at Nea,



vhe had Lanthorns for, and kept firing Guns all the Night
long, letting them know by this, that there -was a Ship
not tar off.
A B o u T 8 a-Clock in the Mrcning we dif:oveFd the
Ship's Beats, by the H-elp of our Perlpcc-tive Glaffes, fbund
there were two of them, Loth t-rong'd with People, and
deep in the Water: Ve pcccived they row'd, the Wind
being againft them, that chey Law our Ship, and did the
utmoft to male: us fce them.
W E immediately fpiead cur Ancient, to let them know
we;flw them, and hung a Waft out as a Signal for them
to come en Board, and then made more Sa'i, hfanding diredly to them. In little more than half an Hour we
came et  with them, and in a word, took them all in,
being no lefs than iixty four Men, Women, and Children;
for there were a great many Pafiengeis.
U p o N the whcele, we found it was a French Merchant Ship of 3oo Tvn, homeward?lound from C~4ebeck,
in the River of Canada. The Malter gave us a long Account of the Difirets of his Ship, how the Fire began in
the Steerage, by the Negligence of the Steeriman; but o0
his crying out for Help, was, as every Body thought,
entirely put out: But they Loon found, that tbme Spa:ks
of the firft Fire had gotten into ibone Part of the Ship,
fo difficult to come at, that they could not efi&amp;f:ually
quench it; and afterwards getting in between the Timbers, and within the Ceiling of the Ship, it proceedcd into
the Hold, andt-  afteri'd all the Skill, and all the Application
thf1y were able to exert.?
TH   Y had no more to do then, but to get into their
Boats, which to their great Comfort, were pretty large,
-being their Long-Boat, and a great Shaloup, betides a
fiLall Skiff which was of no great Service to them, other
than to get Ibme fieflh Water and Provifions into her,
after they had fecur'd there Lives fiom  te Fite. They
had indeed imall Hope of their Lives by getting into theie
Boats at that Difbance from any -Land, only, as they Laid
well, that they were efcap'd fiomn the Fire, and had a PoLfibility that fome Ship might happen to be at Sea, aind
miglht take them in. They had Sails, Oars, and a Corni: pas, and were preparing to mnake the belt of their Way
-:ack 0o Nqewf  l avId, the Wind blpwing pretty fair, for,
-d..t                    W in'r  t      e



it blew an eafy Gale at S. E. by E. They had as much
Provifions and Water, as with fparing it fo as to be next
door to ftarving, might fupport them about 1 z Days; in
which, if they had no bad Weather, and no contrary
Winds, the Captain faid, he hop'd he might get the Banks
of Newfound-land, and might perhaps take oime Fiih to
fuffain them till they might go on Shore. But there were
fo many Chances againf[ them in all thefe Cafes; fuch as
Storms to overfet and founder them;n Rains and Cold to benumb and perifh their Limbs; contrary Winds to keep
them out and ftarve them; that it mui  have been next
to miraculous, if they had efcap'd.
IN the midft of their Confultations, every one being
hopelefs, and ready to defpair, the Captain with Tears in
his Eyes told me, they were on a fudden furpriz'd with
the Joy of hearing a Gun fire, and after that four more;
thefe were the five Guns, which I caufed to be fired at
firf feeing the Light: this revived their Hearts, and gave
them  the Notice, which, as above, I defir'd it fhould,
(viz.) that there was a Ship at hand for their Help.
IT was upon the hearing thefe Guns, that they took
down their Mails and Sails; and the Sound coming from the
Windward, they refolv'd to lie by till Morning. Some
Time after this, hearing no more Guns, they fir'd three
Muskets, one a confiderable while after another i but
thefe, the Wind being contrary, we never heard.
SOM E Time after that again, they were frill more
agreeably furpriz'd with feeing our Lights, and hearing
the Guns, which as I have faid, I caus'd to be fir'd all
the reft of the Night; this fet them to work with their
Oars to keep their Boats a-head, at leaf, [that we might
the fooner come up with thiem; and at laft, to their inexpreffible Joy, they found we faw them.
I T is impoffible for me to exprefs the feveral Geftures,
the ftrange Extafies, the Variety of Poftures which thefe
poor deliver'd People run into, to exprefs the Joy of their
Souls at fo unexpeced a Deliverance; Grief and Fear are
early deicribed; Sighs, Tears, Groans, and a very few
Motions of Head and Hands make up the Sum of its
Variety: But an Excefs of Joy, a Surprize of Joy has a
Thoufand Extravagances in it tbere were fbme in Tears;
Ifome raging and tearing thenelves, as if they had been
-.                                              i u



in the greateft Agonies of Sorrow; fome flark-raving and
down-right Lunatick; fome ran about the Ship flamping
with their Feet, others wringing their Hands; fome were
dancing, fome finging, fome laughing, more crying; many
quite dumb, not able to fpeak a Word; others lick and.
vomiting; feveral fwooning, and ready to faint; and a
few, were Croffing themfelves, and giving God Thanks.
I w o U L D not wrong them neither; there might be
many that were thankful afterward, but the Paffion was
too ftrong for them at firfi, and they were not able to
mater it, they were thrown into Extafies and a kind of
Frenzy, and fo there wee but a very few who were compos'd and ferious in their Joy.
P E R H A r s alfo the Cafe may have fome Addition to it,
from the particular Circumftance of the Nation they belong'd to, I mean the French; whofe Temper is allow'd
to be more volatile, more paffionate, and more fprightly,
and their Spirits more fluid than in other Nations. I am
not Philofopher enough to determine the Caufc, but nothing I had ever feen before came up to it: The Extafies
poor Friday, my trufly Savage, was in when he found his
Father in the Boat, came the neareft to it, and the Surprize of the Malter and his two Companions, who I delivered fiom  the Villains that fet them on Shore in the
Ifland, came a little Way towards it, but nothing was to
compare to this, either that I faw in Friday, or any where
elfe in my Life.
I T is farther obfervable, chat thefe Extravagancies did
not fhew themfelves in that different Manner I havemention'd, in different Perfons only: But all the Variety
would appear in a fhort Succefflon of Moments, in one
and the fame Perfon. A Man that we faw this Minute
dumb, and as it were ftupid and confounded, fhould the
next Minute be dancing and hallowing like an Antick
and the next Moment be tearing his Hair, or pulling his
Clothes to Pieces, and tampingi them under his Feet, like
a Madman; a few Moments after that, we fhould have
him all in Tears, then tick, then fwooning; and had not
immediate Help been had, would, in a few   Moments
more. have been dead; and thus it was not with one or
two, or ten or twenty, but with the greateft Part of
i                                                 thaemi



(20)
themn; and if I remilember right, our Surgeon was oblig'd
to let above thirty of them blood,
T H E.E were two Priefts among them, one an old
Man, and the other a young Man, and that which was
firangeft was, that the oldefi Man was the wo;t-l.
A s foon as he fet his Foot on board our Ship, and faw
himfelf fafe, he dropt down Rone-dead, to all Appearance,
not the leaft Sign of Life coild be perceiv'd in him; our
Surgeon immcdiat&amp;ly apply'd proper Remedies to recover
him, and was the only Man in thle Ship that believ'd he
was not dead  at length he open'd a ein in his Arm,
having firft chaf'd and rubb'd the Pai t fi as to warm it
as much as poliblc: Upon this the Blood, which only
dropp'd at firft, flow'd fomething freely, in th-ee Minutes
after, the Man open'd his Eyes, and about a quarter of an
Hour after that he froke, grew better, and in a little
time quite welli after the Blood was fRopp'd he walk'd
about, told us he was perfetly w-ll, took a D;am  of
Cordial which the Surgeon gave him, and was w:hat we
call'd, Come to hinif r; about a quarter of an Hour after
this, they came running into the Cabin to the Su gecn,
who wTas bleeding a French Woman, that had fainted and
told him, the Prieft was gone frark-mad; it iems he had
begun to revolve the Change of his Circumnfiance in his
Mind, and this put him into an ExtaFi of Joy, his Spirits whirl'd about faller than the Vefills could convey
them   the Blood grew hot and fevertifh, and the Man was as
fit for Belam, as any C eature that ever was in it: The
Surgeon would not bleed him again in that Condition, but
give him fometting to dole and put him to fleep, which
af-er fome Time operated upon him, and he wak'd next
Morning perfectly compos'd, and well.
T H E younger Prieif behav'd himfelfwith great Command
of his Pafion, and was really an Example of a ferious
well-govern'dl NMid; at his firt coming on boa-rd the Ship,
he thcewv himielf fiat on his Face, proitrating himfelf in
Thankfulnefs for his Deliverance; in which I unhappily
and unfeafonably diflurb'd him, really thinking he had been
in a Swoon; but he fpake calmly, thauk'd me; told me,
he was giving God Thanks for his Diliverance; begg'd.me to leave him a few Moments, and that, next to his
Maker, he would give me Thanks alfo.
I WAS



I w A s heartily fbrry, that I difturb'd him, and not only
left him, but kept others from interrupting him alfol  he
continued in that Polture about three Minutes, or a little
more, after I left him, then came to me, as he had iaid
he would, and with a great deal of Serioufnefs and Affection, but with Tears in his Eyes thank'd me thathad, under God, given him and fo many mierable Creatures their
Lives: I told him, I had no Room to move him to thank
God for it, rather than me: For I had feen that he had
done that already: But I;adedl, That it was nothing but
what Rcalobn and Humanity dicarted to all Men, and that
we had as much Reafon as he to give Thanks to God, who
had blefs'd us fo far as to make us the Inftiuments of his
Mercy to fo many of his Creatures.
AFT. R this, the young Plieft apply'd himfelf to his
Country-Folks, labour'd to coompofe them; perfuaded, entreated, argued, reafon'd, writh them, and did his utmoft to
keep them within the Exercife of their Reafon; and with
fome he had Succefs, tho' others were for a Time out of
all Government of themfelves.
I c A N N O T help committing this to Writting, as perhaps it may be ufeful to thofe into whofe Hands it may
fall, in the guiding themfelves in all the Extravagances.of
their Pafions; for if an Excefs of Joy can carry Men out
to fulch a Length beyond the Reach of their Reafon, what
will not the Extravagances of Anger, Rage, and a provok'd
Mind carry us to? and indeed here I faw Reafon for keeping
an exceeding Watch over our Paffipns of every Kind, as
well thofe of Joy and Satisfation, as thoie of Sorrow and
Anger.
W E were fomething diforder'd by thefe Extravagances
among our new Guefts for the fit:it Day; but when they
had been retir'd, Lodgings procvided for them as well as our
Ship would allow, and they had flept Ie-a tily, as moft of
them: did, being fatiga'd and frighted, they were quite
another Sort of People the next Day.
No THIN    of good Manners or civilAcknowledgments
for the Kindnefs Ihewn them was wantintg; the French,
'tis known, are naturally apt enough to e:ceed that Way:
The Captain and one of:l e Picds cnme to lme the next
Day, and deiiring to ipeak with me rrind my Nephew, the
Commander, began to confult with us what flould be
done



done with them; and firft they told us, that as we had
faved their Lives, fo all they had was little enongh for a
Return to us for the Kindnefs received. The Captain faid,
they had fived fome Money and fome Things of Value in
their Boats, catch'd haftily out of the Flames, and if we
would accept it, they were ordered to make an Offer of it
all to us; they only defir'd to befet on Shorefomnewhere in
our Way, where ifpoffibletheymightget Pafige to France.
M    Nephew was for accepting their Money at firf
Word, and to confider what to do with them afterwards;
but I over-rul'd him in that Part, for I knew what it was
to be fet on Shore in a ftrange Country; and if the Portugal Captain, that took me up at Sea had ferv'd me fo,
and took all I had for my Deliverance, I muft haveftarv'd,
or have been as much a Slave at the Brafis, as I had been
in Barbary, the being fold to a Mahometan only excepted;
and perhaps a Portuguefe is not much a better Mafter than a
Turk, if not in fome Cafes a much worfe.
I THE R EF R E told the French Captain that we had taken them up in their Diftrefs, it was true; but that it was
our Duty to do fo, as we were Fellow-Creatures, and as
we would defire to be fo delivered if we were in the like
or any other Extremity; that we had done nothing for
them but what we believed they would have done for us,
if we had been in their Cafe, and they in ours; but that
we took them up to five them, notto plunderthem; and it
would be a moft barbarous Thing to take that little from
them which they had faved out of the Fire, and then fet
them on Shore and leave them; that this would be firft to
fave them from Death, and then kill them our felves; fave
them from drowning, and abandon them to larving; and
therefore I would not let the leaft Thing be taken from
them: As to fetting them on Shore, I told them indeed,
that was an exceeding Difficulty to us, for that the Ship
was bound to the Eajf-Indies; and tho' we were driven out
of our Courfe to the Weftward a very great Way, which
perhaps was direted by Heaven on purpofe for their Deliverance, yet it was impoffible for us wilfully to change
our Voyage on this particular Account; nor could my Nephew, the Captain, anfwer it to the Freighters, with whom
he was under Charter-Party to purfue hisVoyage by the Way
of Brafil, and all I knew  we could do for them, was to
put



out our felves in the Way of meeting with other Ships
homeward bound from the Wef-Indies, and get them Pafige, if poffible, to England or France.
T H E firfl Part of the Propofal was fo generous and kind,
they could not but be very thankful for it; but they were
in a very great Confernation, erpecially the Paffengers, at
the Notion of being carry d away to the Eafj-Indies; they
then intreated me, that feeing I was driven fo far to the
Weftward, before I met with them, I would at leaft keep
on the fame Courfe to the Banks of Newfound-Land,
where it was probable I might meet with fome Ship or
Sloop that they might hire to carry them back to Canada, from whence they came.
I T a OUGH T this was but a reafonable Requefi on their
Part, and therefore I inclin'd to agree to it; for indeed I
confider'd, that to carry this whole Company to the EaflIndies, would not only be an intolerable Severity to the
poor People, but would be ruining our whole Voyage by
devouring all our Provifions; fo I thought it no Breach of
Charter-Party, but what an unforefeen Accident made abfolutely neceffary to us, and in which no one could fay we
were to blame; for the Laws of God and Nature would
have forbid, that we fhould refufe to take up two Boats
full of People in fuch a diftrefs'd Condition, and the Nature
of the Thing as well refpeting our felves as the poor People, oblig'd us to fet them on Shore fome where or other,
for their Deliverance; So I contented that we would carry
them to Newfound-Land, if Wind and Weather would pernit, and if not, that I would carry them to Martinico in
the WeJf-Indies.
THE Wind continued frefh Eafterly, bfit the Weather pretty good, and as it had blowed continually in the Points between N. E. and S.E. a long time, we mified feveral Opportunities of fending them to Frane; for we met feveral
Ships bound to Europe, whereof two were French from St.
Chrtfopher's, but they had been fo long beating up againf
the Wind, that they durf take in no Paffengers for fer of
wanting Provifions for the Voyage, as well for themfelves
as for thofe they Thould take in; fo we were oblig'd to go
on. It was about a Week after this that we made t;e
Banks of Newfound-Land, where, to fhorten myStory, we
ypit all our French People on board a Bark, which they
hir'd



hir'd at Sea there, to put them on Shore, and afterwards
to carry them to France, if they could get Provifion to.
vitual themfelves with: When, I fay, allthe French went on
Shore, I Ihould remember that the young Prieft I fpoke of,
hearing we were bound to the EfaJ-Indies, defir'd to go the
Voyage with us, and to be fet on Shore on the Coaft of Co
romandel: I readily agreed to that, for I wonderfully lik'd
the Man, and had very good Reafon, as will appeal afterwards; alfo four of the Seamen enter'd themfelves on our
Ship, and prov'd very ufeful Fellows.
F R o M hence we dire&amp;ed our Courfe for the Weft-Indies,
fleeringaway S.and S.by E. forabout 20 Days together,fometimes little or no Wind at all, when we met with another
Subject for our Humanity to work  pon, almoft as deplorable as that before..
IT was in the Latitude of 27 Degrees 5 Minutes N.
and the i9th Day of March 16 ',-5, when we 'fpy'd a
Sail, our Courfe S. E. and by S. We foon perceiv'd it was
a large Veffel, and that fhe boreup to us, but could not at firft
know what to make of her, tillafter coming a little nearer,
we found fhe had loft her MainTop-maft, Fore-maft and Boltfprit, and prefently fhe fires a Gun as a Signal of Diftrefs;
the Weather was pretty good, Wind at N. N. W. a frefh.
Gale, and we foon came to fpeak with her.
W E found her a Ship of Brifol, bound home from Barbadoes, but had been blown out of the Road at Barbadoes
a few Days before the was ready to fail, by a terrible Hurricane, while the Captain and Chief-Mate were both gonel
on Shore; fo that, betide the Terror of the Storm, theyI
were but in an indifferent Cafe for good Artifts to bring
the Ship home: 'they had been already nine Weeks at Sea,
and had met with another terrible Srorm after the Hurri,
cane was over, which had blown them quite out of their
Knowledge to the Weltward, and in which they loll their
Mafls, as above; they told us they expeded to have feen
the Bahama Iflands, but were then driven away again
to the South-Eaft, by a ftrong Gale of Wind at N. N. W-.
the fame that blew now, and having no Sails to work the
Ship with, but a Main-Courfe, ande  a kind of Iquare ajl,
upon a Jury-Fore-Maft, which they had fet up, they cwoh
not lie near the Wind, but were cndeavouring to farid., -
way for the Canaries.  '.                      n



B u T that which was worft of all, was, that they were
almoft ftarv'd for want of Provilions, befides the Fatigues
they had undergone; their Bread and Flelh was quite gone,
they had not one Ounce left in the Ship, and had bad none for
i Days; the only Relief they had, was, their Water was
not all fpent, and they had about half a Barrel of Flower
left; they had Sugar enough  fome Succades or SweetMeats they had at firft, but they were devour'd, and they
had feven Casks of Rum.
T H E R E was a Youth and his Mother and a Maid-Servant on board, who were going Paffengers, and thinking
the Ship was ready to fail, unhappily came on board the Evening before the Hurricane began, and having no Provilions
of their own left,they wverein a more dplorableCondition than
the reft; for the Seamen, being reduc'd to fuch an extreme
Nccefity themfelves, had no Compaflion, we may be fure,
for the poor Paffengers; nd they were indeed in a Condition that their Mifery is very hard to defcribe.
I H A D, perhaps, not knownthis Part, if my Curiofity had
not led me, the Weather being fair and the Wind abated, to
go on board the Ship: The Second Mate who upon this Occafion commanded the Ship, had been on board our Ship,
and he told me indeed, that they had three Paffengers in
the great Cabin, that they were in a deplorable Condition;
nay, fays he, I believe they are dead, for I have heard nothing of them for above two Days; and I was afraid to enquire after them, faid he, for I had nothing to relieve them
with.
W E immediately apply'd our felves to give them what
Relief he could fpare; and indeed I had to far over-ruled
Things with my Nephew, that I would have vituall'd
them, tho' we had gone away to Virginia, or any Part of
the Coafl of America, to have fupply'd our felves; but there
was no Neceffity for that.
B u T now they were in a anew Danger; for they were
afraid of eating too much, even of that little we gave them;
the Mate or Commander brought fix Men with him in his
Boat, but there poor Wretches look'd like Skeletons, and
were fob weak, they could hardly fit to their Oars: The
Mate himfelf was very ill, and half farved; for he declar'd he had referv'd nothing from the Men, and went

( 2 6),Share and Share alike with them, in every Bit they
eat.
I CAU T ION D him to eat fparingly, but fet Meat before him immediately, and he had not eaten three Mouthfuls before he began to be fick, and out of order fo he
flopt a while, and our Surgeon mix'd him up fomething
with fome Broath, which he Laid would be to him both
Food and Phylick  and after he had taken it he giew Letter: In the mean Time, I forgot not the Men; I order'd
Victuals to be given them, and the poor Creatures rather
devour'd than eat it; they were ~o exceeding hungly, that
they were in a kind ravenous, and had no Command of
themselves; and two of them eat with fo much Greedinefs, that they were in Danger of their Lives the next
Morning.
T H E: Sight of there People's Diflrefs was very moving
to me, and brought to mind what I had a terrible Profpcft
of at my firft coming on Shore in my Ifland, where I had
not the leaft Mouthful of Food, or any Profpeat of procuring any betides the hourly Apprehenfion I had of being
made the Food of other Creatures: But all the while the
Mate was thus relating to me the miferable Condition of
the Ship's Company, I could not put out of my Thought
the Story he had told me of the three poor Creatures in
the great Cabin, (.viz..) the Mother, her Son, and the MaidServant, who he had heard nothing of for two or three
Days and who he feem'd to confefs they had wholly neglcted, their own Extremities being fo great; by which I
underftood, that they had really given them no Food at all,
and that therefore they muft be perilh'd, and be all lying
dead perhaps on the Floor, or Deck of the Cabin.
A s I therefore kept the Mate, who we then called Captain, on board with his Men to refiefli them, fo I al~o forgot not the ftarving Crew that were left on boat d, but order'd my own Boat to go onboard the Ship, and with my
Mate and twelve Men to carry them a Sack of Bread, and
four or five Pieces of Beef to boil. Our Surgeon charg'd
the Mlen to caufec the Meat to be boil'd while they flay'd, and
to.eep Gaurd in the Cook-Room, to prevent the Men
taking it to eat raw, or taking it out of the Pot before it
was wdl-boil'd, and then to give every Man but a little at
ime i and by this Caution he preferv'd the Men, who
would



would otherwife ha' killd themfeves, with that very Focxf
that was given them on Purpofe to fave their Lives.
A T the fame Time, I ordered the Mate to go into the
great Cabin, and fee what Condition the poor Paifengers
were in, and if they were alive, to comfort them, and give
them what Refreihment was proper; and the Surgeon gave
him a large Pitcher with fome of the prepar'd Broth which
he had given the Mate that was on Board, and which he
did not queftion would reftore them gradually.
I w A s not fatisfied with this, but, as I faid above, having a great Mind to fee the Scene of Mifery, which I knew
the Ship it felf would prefent me with, in a more lively
Manner than I could have it by Report, I took the Captain
of the Ship, as we now call'd him, with me, and went my
fdf a little after in their Boat.
I F o u N D the poor Men on board almoft in a Tumult
to get the Viduals out of the Boiler before it was ready:
But my Mate obferv'd his Order, and kept a good Guard at
the Cook-Room Door, and the Man he plac d there, after
uling all poffible Perfuafion to have Patience, kept them off
by Force: However, he caufed fome Bisket Cakes to be
dipp'd in the Pot, and foften'd them with the Liquor of the
Meat, which they call Brewes, and gave them every one
One, to fray their Stomachs, and told them it was for their
own Safety that he was oblig'd to give them but a little at
a time: But it was all in vain, and had I not comeon board,
and their own Commander and Officers with me, and with
good Words, and fome Threats alfoof giving them no more,
I believe they would have broke into the Cook-Room by
Force, and tore the Meat out of the Furnace: For Words
are indeed of very fmall Force to a hungry Belly: However
we pacify'd them, and fed them gradually and cautioufly for
the firft Time, and the next Time gave them more, and at
lat fill d their Beljies, and the Men did well enough.
B UT the Mifery of the poor Pafiengers in the Cabin wat
of another Nature, and far beyond the reft; for asfirfl, the
Ship's Company had fo little for themfelves, it was but too
true that they had at firft kept them very low, and at laft
totally negleted them; fo that for fix or feven Days, it
might be faid, they had really had no Food at all, and for
feveral Days before, very little. The poor Mother, who, as
thX firft Mate reported, was a Woman of good Sence and
s,            gooi



good Breeding, had fpar'd all fle could get fo affeC&amp;ionately
or her Son, that at laft lhe entirely funk under it: Aind
when the Mate of Ship went in, fle fit upon the Floor or
Deck, with her Back up againft the Sides, between two
Chairs, which were lafh'd faft, and-her Head funk in between her Shoulders, like a Corpfe, tho' not quite dead.
My Mate faid all he could to revive and cncou age her, and
with a Spoon put fome Broth into her Mouthi; fh openled her Lips, and lifted up one Hand, but could not fpeak
yet f e udnerilood what he fiid, and made Signs to him,
intimating, that it was too late for her, but pointed to her
Child, as if flhe would have faid, they fhould take Care of
him.
HOWEV ER the Mate, who was exceedingly mov'd.with the Sight, cndeavour'd to get fbme of the Broth into her Mouth; and, as he faid, got two or three Spoonfuls
down, tho' I queftion whether he could be fiie of it or
lot: But it was too late, and fle dy'd the fame Night.
T H E Youth, who was prcferv'd at the Price of his moft
afie&amp;ionate Mother's Life, was not oi far gone, yet he lay
in a Cabin-bed as one ftretch'd out, with hardly any Life
left in him, he had a Piece of an old Glove in his Mouth,
having eaten up the reft of it; however, being young, and
having more Strength than his Mother, the Mate got ibmething down his Throat, and he began fenfibly to revive,
though by giving him ornme time after but two or three
Spoonfuls extraordinary, he was very tick, and brought it
up again.
B u T the next Care was the poor Maid, fle lay all along
upon the Deck, hard by her Miftrefs, and juft like one that
h ad fallen down with an Apoplexy, and flruggled for Life:
Her Limbs were diforted, one of her Hands was clafp d
round the Frame of the Chair, and flhe grip'd it fo hard,
thlat we could not eafily make her let g9;  her other Arm
lay over her Head, and her Feet lay both together, fet af
againfr the Frame of the Cabin-table; in fholt, We lay juft
like one in the laft Agonies of Death; and yet fle was
alive too. -
T H E poor Creature was not only ftarv'd with Hunger,
and terrify d with the Thoughts of Death, but, as the Men
told ns afterwards, was broken-hcaIted for her Miftrefs,
who



who fl:c faw dying two or three Days before, and who fh
ov 'd 'mofl tnderlv.
W E knew not what to do with this poor Girl, for
when our Sulgeon, who was a Man of very great Knowledge and Expericnce, had with great Application recover'd
er, as to Life he had her upon his Hand as to her Senfes,
for the was little lets than difr-aded for a confidei able Tims
*fter, as flall appear prefently.
\V H 0 o V E R fl all read thefe Memorandums muff be defir'd to confider, that Vifits at Sea are not like a journey
into the Country, wvhee fometimes People t-y a Week or
a Fortnight a: a Place. Our Bufinefs was to relieve this
difhefied Ship's Crew, but not lie by for th;c:  and tho'
they were willing to fleer the fame Courfe with us for
lome Days, yet we could carry no Sail to keep Pace with
a Ship that had no Mafiss  however, as their Captain Lb-,g'd of us to help him to let up a Main-Top-Maft, and a
kind of Top-Maft to his Ju y-Fore-Maft.  We did, as it
were lie by him for three or four Days, and then having
given him five Barrels of Beef, a Barrel of Pork, two Hogfl eadsof Bisket, and a Porportion of Peas, Flowr, and xwhrat
other Things we could fpa e; and taking three Casks of
Sugar, fome Rum, and fome Pieces of Eight of them for
Satisfa&amp;tion, we left them, taking on board with us, at their
own earneft Requeft, the Youth, and the Maid, and all their
Goods.
T H E young Lad was about feventeen Years of Age, a
pretty, well-bied, modeff, and fenfible Youth; greatly dejected with the Lois of his Mother, and, as it ieems, had
loft his Father but a few Months before at Barbailos. He
begg d of the Surgeon to fpeak to me, to take him out of
the Ship, for he faid the cruel Fellows had murthcr'd his
Mother; and indeed fo thy hld, that is to fay p/i. c.; for
they might ha' fpar'd a imall Suftenance to the poor helplefs Widow, that might have prefetv'd her Life, tho' it had
been but juft to keep her alive. But Hunger knows no
Friend, no Relation, no Tuftice, no Right, and thcierfrce i
remorfelefs, and capable of no Compaffion.
T HE Surgeon told him how   far we were going, and
how it would carry him away from all his Friends, and put
him perhaps in as bad Circumfiances almoft as we found
them in; that is to fay, flarving in the World. He faid he
B3                    mat


nmtter'd not whether he went, if he was but deliver'd from
the terrible Crew, that he was among: Tlat the Captain
(by which he meant me, for he could know nothing of
my Nephew) had fav'd his Life, and he was fure would;aot hurt him; and as for the Maid, he was Liire if fie
came to her felf, fe would be very thankful for it, Iet
us carry them where we would. The Surgeon reprefentid the Cafe fo affectionately to me, that I yielded, and we
took them both on boar d with all their Goods, except eleven
Hogfl eads of Sugar, which could not be removed or come
at, and as the Youth had a Bill of Ladirg for them, I
made his Commander iign a Writing, obliging himfelf to
go as foon as he came to Briftol, to one Mr. Rogers a Merchant there, to whom the Youth faid he was related, and
to deliver a Letter which I wrote to him, and all the
Goods he had belonging to the deceafed Widow; which I
fuppofe was not done, for I could never learn that the Ship
came to Brif/ol, but was, as is moft probable, loft at Sea,
being in fo difabled a Condition, and Fo far from any Land,
that lam of Opinion, the firft Storm fle met with afterwards, fhe might founder in the Sea, for fhe was leaky,
and had Damage in her Hold when we met with her.
I W-A s now  in the Latitude of 19 Deg. 32 Min. and
had hitherto had a tolerable Voyage as to Weather, though
at firft the Winds had been contrary. I fhall trouble no
body with the little Incidents of Wind, Weather, Currents,
&amp;tc. on the reft of our Voyage; but fhortning my Story
for the fake of what is to follow, fhall obferve that I came
to my old Habitation, the Ifland, on Ioth of Apri, I695'.
It was with no finall Difficulty that I found the Place;
for as I came to it, and went from it before, on the South
and Eafi Side of the Ifand, as coming from theBr,ls, fo
now coming in between the Main and the Ifland, and havmg no Chart for the Coait, nor any Land-Mark, I did
not know  it when I faw it, or know whether I faw it
or no.
W E beat about a great while, and went on Shore on fe.
veral Iflands in the Mouth of the great River Oronooque,
but none for my Purpofe.  Only this I learn'd by my
Coaffing the Shore, that I was under one great Miftake before, viz. that the Continent which I thought I iaw, from
we Ifland I liv'd in, was really no Continent, but a long
Ifand,



Ifland, or rather a Ridge of Iflands, reaching from one to
the other Side of the extended Mouth of that great River,
and that the Savages who came to my Ifland, were not
properly thole which we call Caribbees, but Iflanders and
other Barbarians'of the fame Kind, who inlabited fobething nearer to our Side than the reft.
I N fiort, I vilited feveral of thefe Iflands to no Purpofe;
fome I found were inhabited, and fbme were not. On one
of them I found fome Sraniards, and thought they hadliv'd
there, but fpeaking with them, found they had a Sloop lav
in a fmall Creek hard by, and they came thither to nmake
Salt, and to catch fbme Pearl Mufcles if they could, but
that they belong'd to the Ifle de Trinidad, which lay farther
North, in the Latitude of I o and I I Degrees.
THU s coating from one Ifland to another, fometimes
with the Ship, fometimes with the French Man's Shalloup,
(which we had found a convenient Boat, and therefore k[ept
her with their very good Will;) at length I came fair on
the South Side of my Ifland, and I prefently knew the very Countenance of the Place fo I brought the Ship fae to
an Anchor, Broadfide with the little Creek where was my
old Habitation.
A s loon as I faw the Place, I call'd for Friday, and alk'd
him if he knew where he was? He look'd about a li:tle,
and prefently, clapping his Hands, cry'd; 0 yes,  there,
0 yes, 0 there, pointing to our old Habitation, and fell a
dancing and capering like a mad Fellow, and I had much
ado to keep him from jumping into the Sea, to fwim aflhore to the Place.
Well, Friday, fays I, do you think we fhall find any bo-'
dy here or no? And what do you think, fhall we fee your
Father? The Fellow flood mute as a Stock a good;hi le,
but when I nam'd his Father, the poor affeftibnate Creature
look'd deje&amp;ed, and I could fee the Tears run down his
Face very plentifully. What is the matter, Friday, fays I?
Are you troubled becaufe you may fee your Father? No,
no, Jays he, fhaking his Head, no fee him m ore, no ever
more fee again; ffyfo, faid I, Friday, hon i yom k:ow
that 0        no, no, ys Friday, he long ago die,'ong ao,
he much old Man. Well, well, fa   F I, FrSdy, you don't
know   but fhall we fee any one deli tlie?. The Fellow, it
Ieems, had better Eyes than I, and he points juft to the Hill
B 4                    above



al-ove my old Houfe and tho' we lay half a League off, he
cries out, me fee! me fee! yes, yes, mefee much Man there,
and there, and there. I look'd, but I could fee no body,
no not with a Perfpe6tive Giafs  which was, I fuippofe,
Lecaufe I could not hit the Place, for the Fellow was right,
as I found upon Enquiry the next Day, and there was five
or fix Men altogether, flood to look at the Ship, not knowing what to think of us.
A s foon as Friday had told me he Law People, I caus'd
the Engifhl Ancient to be fpread, and fir'd three Guns, to
give them notice we were Friends, and in about half a
Quarter of an Hour after, we perceiv'd a Smoak rife fi om
the Side of the Creek, fo I immediately order'd a Boat out,
taking Friday with me, and-hanging out a white Flag, or
a Flag of Truce, I went directly on Shore, taking with me
the young Fryer I mention'd, to whom  I had told the
whole Story of my living there, and the Manner of it, and
every Particular both of my felf, and thofe that I left there;
and who was on that Account extremely defirous to go
with me., We had befides about fixteen Men very well
armd, if, we had found any new Guefts there which we
did not know of; but we had no need of Weapons.
A s we went on Shore upon. the Tide of Flood, near
high Water, yre row'd directly into the Creek, and the firft
Man, I fix'd my Eye upon, was the S[taiiard whofe Lifi I
had fav'd, and whi I knew by his Face perfectly well; as
to his Habit I flall defcribe it afterwards. I order'd no body to go on Shore at firft but my felf, but there was no
keeping Friday in the Boat; for the affedionate Creature
bad fpy'd his Father at a Diflance, a good way off of the
Spaniards, where indeed I faw nothing of him  and if they
had not let him go on Shore, he would have jump'd into
the Sea. He was no fooner on Shore, but he flew away
to his Father like an Arrow out of a Bow. It would have
made any Man have fhed Tears in fpight of the firmeft Refolution, to have feen the firff Tranfports of this poor Fellow's Joy when he came to his Father; how he embracd
him, kifs'd him,~ ftrokd his Face, took him up in his Arms,
fit him down upon a Tree,, and lay down by him; then
flood and look'd at him, as any one woukld look at a firange
/ Pipture for a Qater of an Hour together, then lye dowt



on the Ground, and troke his Legs, and kifs them, and
then get up again, and flare at him; one would ha' thought
the  Fellow  bewitch'd: But it would have made    a
Dog laugh to fee how the next Day his Paffion run
out another Way: In the Morning he walk'd along the
Shore, to and again, with his Father feve;al Hours, alvays
leading him by the Hand, as if he had been a Lady  and
every now and then would come to fetch fomething or
other for him to the Boat, either a Lump of Sugar, or a
IDram, a Bisket, or fomething or other that was good.
In the Afternoon his Frolicks run another Way  fo' then
he would fet the old Man down upon the Ground, and
dance about him, and made a Thoufand antick Pofhines
and Geftures; and all the while he did this, he would be
talking to him, and telling him one Story or ainother of
his Travel, and of what had happen'd to him Abroad, to
divert him.  In flort, if the lime filial Affetion was to
be found in Chriftians to their Parents, in our Paits of the
World, one would be tempted to fay, there would hardly
ha' been any Need of the fiftth Commandment.
BUT this is a Digreffion; I return to my Landing.
It would be endlefs to ake Notice of all the Ceremonies
ard Civilities that the Spaniards receiv'd me with. The
fiIft spaniard, who, as I iadT, I knew very well, wa'
he whole Life I had fav'd; he came towards the Boat,
attended by one more, carrying a Flag of TruceaI  alf  ad lie
did not only not know me at firft, but he had no Thoughrs,
no Notion of its being me that was come, till. I fpoke to
him: Seignior,. aid I, in Portuguefe, Io you not know
me? At which he fpoke not a Wo,:d; but giving his Musket to the Man that was with him, threw his Arms abroad, andfaying fomething in Spanrifh, that I did not p rfedly hear, came forward, and embrac'd me, telling me he
was inexcufable, not to know that Face again, that he had
once feen, as of an Angel fiom IHeaven,, Lent to fliye his
Life: He flid Abuli:ance of very landblome Things, as a
well-b, -e Sphi'rdrl always knows how; and then beckoning to the FPerf.n that attended him, bad him go and call
out his Comneradcs.  He then ask'd me, if I would '-a.lk
to my old Habitation, where he would.ivc me P&lt; iTf': i
of my own HI-oufe atgain, and wc.ce I fT'oul, fi tle  t rclad
been "but mean Improvements; fb I walk'd.:lc,; with
B             '         hI:,



but alas! I could no more find the Place again, than if t
had never been therei for they had planted fo many Trees,
and plac'd them in fuch a Pofture, fo thick and clofe to
one another and in ten Year's Time they were grown fo
big, that in hort the Place was inacceflible, except byfuch
Windings and blind Ways, as they themfelves only, who
made them, could find.
I A S K D them what put them upon all thefe Fortifications? He told me, I would fay there was need enough
of it, when they had given me an Account how they had
pafs'd their Time fince there Arriving in the Ifland, efpecially after they had the Misfortune to find that I was
gone: He told me, he could not but have fome Satisfadion in my good Fortune, when he heard that I was gone
in a good Ship, and to my Satisfaction  and that he had
often-times a ftrong Perfuafion, that one Time or otherhe
Should fee me again: But nothing that ever befel him in
his Life, he faid, was fo furprifmng and affliting to him at
firft, as the Difappointment he was under when he came
back to the Ifland, and found I was not there.
A s to the three Barbarians (fo he call'd them) that were
left behind, and of whom he faid he had a long Story to
tell me; the Spaniards all thought themfelves much better
among the Savages, only that their Number was fo fmall.
And, fays he, had they been itrong enough, we had been
'all long ago in Purgatory; and with that he crofs'd him-,felf on the Breaft: But, Sir, fays he, I hope you will not
be difpleafed, when I frall tell you how, forc'd by Neceffity, we were oblig'd, for our own Prefervation, to diiarm
them, and making them our Subjects, who would not be
content with being moderately our Maiers, but would be
our Murtherers. I anfwer'd, I was heartily afraid of it
when I left them there; and nothing troubled me at my
-,arting from  the Ifland, but that they were not come
back, that I might have put them  in Pofleffion of every
Thing firft, and left the other in a State of SubjeCtion, as
they deferv'd: But if they had reduced them  to it, I
was very glad, and fllould be very far from finding any
Fault with it; for I knew they were a Parcel of refracto y, unpovern'd Villains, apd were fit for any Manner of
MW iJfci
WH IL S



WH i E I was Laying this, came the Man whom he
had fent back, and with him eleven Men more: In the
Drefs they were in, it was impoffible to guefs what
Nation they are of: But he made all clear both to them
and to me. Firft he turn'd to me, and pointing to them,
Laid, Thefe, Sir, are fome of the Gentlemen who owe their
Lives to you; and then turning to them, and pointing to
me, he let them know who I was; upon which they all
came up one by one, not as if they had been Sailors and
ordinary Fellows, and I the like, but really, as if they had
been Ambafradors of Noblemen, and I  a Monarch or a
great Conqueror their Behaviour was to' the  f.IDegree
obliging and courteous, and yet mix'd with a manly, majeftick Gravity, which very well became them; and in
fhoit, they had ~o much more Manners than I, that I fcarce
knew how to receive their Civilties, much lefs how to return them in kind.
T H E Hiftory of their coming to, and Condac in the
Ifland, after my going away, is fo very remarkable, and
has fo many Incidents, which the fo'mner Part of my Relation will help to undertiand, and which, will, in molt of
the Particulars, refer to that Account I hae already given,
that I cannot but commit them with great' Delight to the
reading of thofe that come after me.
I flall no longer trouble the Story with a Relation in
the firft Perfon, which will put me to the Expce of ten
Thoufand faid lIs, and faid he's, an he toMW  e's sand I -tdd
him's, and the like, but I fliall colleO the Fas hiftoricaty,
as near as I can gather them out of mny -Memory from
what they related to me, and from what I met with in
my converting with them, and with the Place.
I N order to do this fuccinctly, and as intelligibly as I
can, I muft go back to the Circumftance in which I left
the Ifland, and which the Perfons were in, of whom I ant
to fpeak. And fil ft it is neceffary to repeat, that I had lent
away Friday's Father and the spaniard, the two whole
Lives I hal refcued from the Savages; I fay, I had fent,
them away in a la ge Canoe to the Main, as I then thouht
it, to fetch over the spamnird's Companions whom he had
left behind him, in order to five them from the like Calamity that he had been in; and in order to fuccour them for
the p;cfnt, and that if Folible, we might together fini
Come Way for our Deliverance afterward,       WHEN



3:6 )
W     N'l   I -ent them away, I had no vifible Appeariance
of, or the leaft Room to hope for my own Deliverance
any more than I had twenty Year before, much lefs had
I any Fore knowledgeof what after happened, I mean of an
Engli/h Ship comng on Shore there to fetch me off; and it
could not but bea very great Surprizeto them when they
came back, not only to find that I was gone, but to find
three Strangers left on the Spot, poffefs'd of all that I had
left behind me, which would otherwife have been their
own.
T I E firft Thing, however, which I enquir'd into, that
I might fcgin where I left off, was of their own Part;
and I defirrd he would give me a particular Account of
his Voyage back to his Countrymen with the Boat, when
I fent him to fetch them over. He told me there was
little Variety in that Part, for nothing remarkable happen'd
to them on the Way, they having very calm Weather, anc
a fmooth Sea i;for his Countrymen it could not be doubted
he faid, but thatthey were over joy'd to fee him: It feems
he twas-the principal Man among them, the Captain of the
Vefel they. hat been Shipwreckd in (having been Dead
titme Time) theywere, he faid, the more Surp-ized to fee
him, becaufe they knew that he was fallen into the Hands of
tie Savages, who, they were fatisfy'd, would devour himas they didall the reft of their Prifoners that when they told
them the Story of his Deliverance, and in what Manneri
he was f;unifh'di forl carrying them away, it was like
a Dreamnt  tlieni,' and their Aftonifhment, they faid, was
fbmethinglikethatof _7jph's Brethren, when he toldthem:
who he was, and told them the Story of his Exaltation
in Pharoah's Court: Bit when he fliewed them the Arms,
Fhe Powder, the Ball, and the Provifions that he brought
them for 'their Journey or Voyage, they were leftor'd to
themfelves, took a juft Share ofthe Joy of their Deliverance,, and immediately prepar'd to come away with him.
Tn E IR firft Bufinefs was to get Canoes; and in this
they were obliged not to ftick fo much upon the honeft
Part of it, but to trefpafs upon their friendly Savages, and to
bonrow two lat ge Canoes or Periagua's, on pretence of going out a Fifling; or for Pleafure.
f i



I N thee they came away the next Morning; it ftems they
wanted no Time to get themfelves ieady, for they had no
Baggage, neitheir Clothes or Provifions, or any Thing in
the Vvorld, but what they had on them, and a few Roots
to eat, of which they ufed to make their Bread.
T HE Y were in all three Weeks abfent, and in that
Time, unluckily for them, I had the Occafion offer'd for
my Efcape, as I mention'd in my other Part, and to get off
fiom the Ifland; leaving three of the mofl impudent,
harden'd, ungovern'd, diigi eea-le Villains behind me, that
any Man could defire to meet with, to the poor Spaniards.
great Grief and Difappointment, you may be fure.
THE only juft Thing the Rogues did, was, Thatwhen
the Spaniards came on Shore, they gave my Letter to them,
and gave them Proviiions and other Relief, as I had or â
dered them to do; alfo they gave them the long Parper of
Dire&amp;tions which I had left with them, containing the
Particular Methods which I took for maraging evely Part
of my Life theie, the Way how I baked my B;:ead,
b-ed up my tame Goats, and planted my Corn, how   I
cuti'd my G&amp;apesr, made my Pots, and, in a Word, every
Thing I did, all this being Written down, thev gave

enough, nor did they refufe to accomodate the SpaAifmrs.
with any Thing elfe, for they agreed vely well for onbme
Time they gave them an equal Admiflion into the Houfe
or Cave, and they began to live very fociably; and the Head
Spaniard, who had Seen pretty much ef my Method, and
Friday's Father together, manig'd?11 their Aflail s; for, as
for the Englifhmen  they did nothing but Ramble about
the Ifland, flhoot Parrots, and catch To toiK:s, and when
they came Home at Night, the Spaniir/; provided their
Suppers for them.
T HE Spaniards would have been fatifsy'd' with this,
would the other but have let erm alone,which, however.they
could not find in their Hearts to do longs butlike the Dog in
the Manger, they would not eat themnielves, and would
not let others eat neither: The Differences, neverthelefs,
were at fir f but trivial, and fuch as are not worth relatirng;
but at hla it btoke out into open War, and it begun with
all the Rudenefs and Infllence that can be imagin'd, wirlth

deed, to common Senfe  and tho' it is true the firft Relation of it came from the Spanir&amp;ds themfelves, who I
-tnay call the Accufers, yet when I came to examine the
Fellows, they could not deny a Word of it.
B u T before I come to the Particulars of this Part. I
muft Supply a Defet in my former Relation, and this was,
that I forgot to fet down among the reft, that juft as we
were weighing the Anchor to let Sail, there, happened a
little Quarrel on board our Ship, which I was afraid once
would have turned to a fecond Mutiny; nor was it appeas'd, till the Captain rouzing up his Courage, and taking
us all to his Affiftance, parted them by Force, and making
two of the moft refa6tory Fellows Prifoners, he laid them
in Irons, and as they had been a6tive in the former Diforders, and let fall fome ugly dangerous Words the fecond
Time, he threatn'd to carry them in Irons to Englan4, and
have them hang'd there for Mutiny, and running away
with the Ship.
T HI s, it feems, tho' the Captain did not intend to do
it, frighted fome other Men in the Ship, and fome of
them had put it into the Heads of the reft, that the Captain only gave them good Words for the prefent, till they
fhould come to fome Englifh Port, and that then they
fl:ould be all put into a Jayl, and try'd for their Lives.
THE Mate got Intelligence of this, and acquainted us
with iti upon which it was defir'd, that I, who ftill pafs'd
for a great Man among them, fliould go down with the
Mate, and fatisfy the Men, and tell them, that they might
be afnur'd, if they behav'd well the reft of the Voyage, all
they had done for the Time pail fhould be pardon'd.  So
I went, and after paffing my Honour's Word to them, they
appear'd eafy; and the more fo, when I caufed the two
Men, who were in Irons, to be releafed and forgiven.
B U T this Mutiny had brought us to an Anchor for that
Night, the Wind alfo falling calm, next Morning we
found, that our two Men who had been laid in Ihons, had
ftcle each of them a Musket, and fome other Weapons,
what Powder or Shot they had, we know not; and had
taken the Ship's Pinnace, which was not yet hal'd up,and
ran away with her to their Companions, in Rogury, on
Shoie.



As Loon as we found this, I order'd the Long-Boat on
Shore, with twelve Men and the Mate, and away they
went to feek the Rogues, but they could neither findthem,
or any of the reft; for they all fled into the Woods when
they fai the Boat coming on'Shore. The Mate was once
reiblv'd in Juftice to their Rogery, to have deftroy'd their
Plantations, burnt all their Houflold-Stuff and Furniture,
and left them to fhift without it; but having no Order,
he let all alone, left every Thing as they found it, and
bringing the Pinnace away, came on Board without
them.
T H E SE two Men made their Number five, but the other three Villains were fo much wickeder than thefe, that
after they had been 2 or 3 Days together, they turned
their two New-Comers out of Doors to fhift for themfelves, and would have nothing to do with them, nor
could they for a good while be perfuaded to give them
any Food; as for the Spaniards they were not yet come.
W H E N the Spaniards came firft on Shore, the Bufmefs
began to go forward; the Spaniards would have perfuaded the three Engli/h Brutes to have taken in their two
Countrymen again, that, as they faid. they might be all
one Family  but they would not hear of it: So the two
poor Fellows liv'd by themfelves, and finding nothing but
Induftry and Application would make them live comfortably, they pitch'd their Tents on the North-fiore of the
Ifland, but a little more to the Wefi, to be out of the
Danger of the Savages, who always landed on the Eoaf
Parts of the Illand.
H E R E they built them two Huts, one to lodge in, and
the other to lay up their Magazines and Stores in, and the
Spaniards having given them fome Corn for Seed, and efpecially Come of the Peas which I had left them, they dug
and planted, and enclofed, after the Pattern I had Act for
them all, and began to live pretty well their firft Crop of
Corn was on the Ground, and tho' it was but a little bit
of Land which they had dug up at firft, having had but a
little Time, yet it was enough to relieve them, and find
them with Bread and other Eatables; and one of the Fellows being the Cook's Mate of the Ship, was very ready
at making Soup, Puddings, and fuch other Preparations,
as



(40   )
as the Rice, and the Milk, and fuch little Flefl as they
got, furnifh'd him to do.
T HEY were going on in a little thriving Pofiure, when
the three unnatural Rogues, their own Countrymen too,
in mere Humour, and to infult them, came and bully'd
them, and told them, the Ifland was theirs; that the Governour, meaning me, had given them Poffeffion of it,
and no Body elfe had any right to it, and damn 'em, they
ifould build no Houfes upon their Ground, unlefs they
would pay them Rent for them.
TH E two Men thought they had jelled at firfir
ask'd them to come and lit down, and fee what fine
Houfes they were, that they had built, and tell them what
Rent they demanded, and one of them merrily told them,
if they were Ground-Landlords, he hoped, if they built
Tenements upon the Land, and made Improvenents, they
would, according to the Cuftom of all Landlords, grant
them a long Leafe, and bid them go fetch a Sciivener to
draw the Wiitings. One of the three damnning and rageing, told them, -they fl-uld fee they were not in Jetl,
and going to a little Place at a Diflance, where the honelt
Men had made a Fire to drefs their Vi&amp;u'lnls, he takes a
Fire-b!and, and claps it to the Out-iide of their Hut, and
very fairly fet it on Fire, anl it would have been all burnt
down in a few Minutes, if one of the two had not run to
the FellowT, thruft him away, and trod the Fire out with
his Feet, and that not without fome Difficulty too.
T HI E Felow was in iuch a Rage at the honeft Man's
thrufling him away, that he turn'd upon him with a Pole
he had in his Hand, and had not the Man avoided the Blow
very nimbly, and run into the Hut, he had ended his Days
at once; his Comrade feeing the Danger they were both
in, run in after him, and immediately they came both
out with their Muskets, and the Man that was filt ftruck
at with the Pole, knock'd the Fellow down, who begun
the Quarrel, with the Stock of the Musket, and that lefore the other two could come to help him, and then feeing the reft come at them, they flood togethe:, and ptefenting the other Ends of their Pieces to them, bad them
fand off.
THE other had Fite-Arms wish th-cm too, but one of
the two honefl Men,. older than his Comrade,,aind made
d' iticrat c



defperate by his Danger, told them, if they offer'd to
move Hand or Foot they were dead Men, boldly commanded them to lay down their Arms. They did not
indeed lay down their Aims, but feeing him refolute, it
brought them to a Parley, and they conienred to take their
wounded Man with them, and be gone and indeed it feems
the Fellow was wounded fufficiently with the Blow;
however, they were much in the wrong, fince they had
the Ad,antage, that they did not difarm them effedtually, as
they might have dore, and have gone immediately to the
Spaniards, and given them an Account how the Rogues had
treated them  for the three Villains ftudied nothing but
Revenge, and every Day gave them fome intimation that
they did fo,
B u T not to crow'd this Part with an Account of the
leffer Part of their Roguries, fuch as treading down their
Corn, flooting three young Kids, and a She-Goat, which
the poor Men had got to breed up Tame for their Store;
and, in a Word, plaguing them Night and Day in this
Manner, it forced the two Men to fuch a Defperation, that
they refolv'd to fight them all three the firft Time they
had a fair Opportunity, in order to this they refolv'd
to go to the Caftle, as they called it, that was my old
Dwelling where the three Rogues and the Spaniards all
liv'd together, at that Time;- intending to have a fair Battle, and the Spaniards flhould fland by to fee fair Play. fo they
got up in the Morning before Day. and came to the Place,
and call'd the Engiflfmern by their Names, telling a Spaniard-tliat anliver'd, that they wanted to fpeak with them.
I r happen'd that the Day before two if the Spaniardsr
having been in the Woods, had feen one of the two Englifmen, who, for Diftin&amp;ion, I call the Honeft Men; and
he had made a fad Complaint to the Spavziards, of the
barbarous Ulage they had met with from their thlree Countrymen, and how they had ruin'd their Plantation, and deftroy'd
their Corn, tht they had labour'd fo hard to bring forward, and kill'd the Miltch-Goat, and their three Kids,
which was all they had provided for their Suftenance, and
that if he and his Friends, meaning the Spaniards, did not
afflft them again, they fhould be farved. When the Spaniards came Home at Night, and they were all at Supper,'
he took the Freedom to reprove the three En,,Jfl/men, thot
is



in gentle and mannerly Terms, and ask'd them, Howv they
could be fo cruel, they being harmlefs inoffeniive Fellows,
and that they were putting themfelves in a Way to iblfift
by their Labour, and that it had coft them  a great deal of
Pains to bring Things to fuch a Perfection as they had?
O N E of the Engflijhmer return'd very briskly, what had
they to do there? That they came on Slhore without
Leave, and they fhould not Plant or Build upon the Iland,
it was none of their Ground. Why, fays the Spaniard
very calmly, Seigrior Inglefe, they Jmuz not flarve? The
Englifmen reply d like a true irough-hewn Tarpaulin, they
might ftarve and be damn'd, they fhould not Plant nor
Build in that Place. But what muit they do then, Seignor, fays the Spaniard? Another of the Brutes return' d,
do! D âm 'em, they fhould be Servants and work for
them. But how can you expef6 that of them, they are
not bought with your Money; you have no Right to
make them Servants? The Englijhmen anfwer'd, the Ifland
Was theirs, the Governour had given it to them, and no
Man had any thing to do there but themfelves 'and with
that fwore by his Maker, that they would go and burn?
all their new Huts, they. flhould build none upon their
Land.
W, y, Seignior, fays the Spaniard, by the fame Rule
we muft be your Servants too? Ay, fays the lold Dog,
and fo you ifall too, before we have done with you, mixing two or three G âd Damme s in the proper Intervals of
his Speech; the Spaniard only fmild at that, and madehim
no Anfwer: However, this little Difcourfe had heated them,
and flarting up, one fays to the other, I think it was he
they call d Will. tkin.s, Come Yack, let us go and have the
t'other Brufl with them,; well demoliflh their (aftle,
I 1 warrant youi they flail plant no Colony in our Dominions.
U PON this, they went all Trooping away, with every
Man a Gun, a Piftol, and a Sword, and mutter'd fome infolent Things among themfelves, of what they would do
to the Spaniards too, when Opportunity offer'd, but the
Spaniards, it feems, did not ib perfetly underfland them,
as to know all the Particulars, only, that in general, they
threatned them hard for taking the two ElngflimmsPart.
WHETHE1



W HE THER they went, or how they beflow'd their
Time that Evening, the Spaniards ~aid, they did not know;
but it feems they wander'd about the Country, pa t of the
Night, and then lying down in the Place which I ufed to
call my Bower, they were weary, and ovcr-flept themfalves. The Cafe was this, they had refolv'd to flay till
Mid-night, and fo to take the poor Men when they were
afleep, and as they acknowledged it afterwards, intended
to fet Fire to their Huts while they were in them, and either burn them in them, or murder them  as they came
out: and as Malice feldom fieeps very found, it was very
Alange they fhculd not have been kept waking.
H ow E VE R, as the two Men had alfo a Defign upon
them, as I have faid, tho' a much fairer one than that of
Burning and Murdering, it happen'd, and very luckily for
them all, that they were up and gone abroad, before the
bloody-minded Rogues came to their Huts.
W H E N they came there and found the Men gone, Atkins, who it feems was the forwardefl Man, calld out to
his Comrades, ha' 7ack, here's the Neft, but, D ----n 'em,
the Birds are flown: They mufed a while to think what
fhould be the Occafion of their being gone abroad fo foon,
and fuggeffed prefently that the Spaniard had given them
Notice of it, and with that they flook Hands, and fwore
to one another that they would be reveng d of the spfaw
ards. As foon as they had made this bloody Bargain, they
fell to work with the poor Mens Habitation, they did not
fet Fire indeed to any Thing, but they pull'd down both
their Houfes, and pull d them fo Limb from Limb, that
they left not the leaft Stick flanding, or fcarce any Sign on
the Ground where they flood; they tore all their little colle6ted Houflold Stuff in pieces, and threw every thing about in fuch a Manner, that the poor Men found afterward s
ibme of their Things a Mile off from their Habitation.
WHE N they had done this, they pull d up all the young
Trees which the poor Men had planted; pull'd up the Enclofure they had made to fecure their Cattle and their Corn;
and, in a Word, fack'd and plunder'd every thing, as compleatly as a Hoard of Tartars would have done.
T  E two Men were at this Junlture gone to find them
out, and had refolv'd to fight them where-ever they had
been, tho' they were but two to three: So that had they
met,



met, thcee certainly would have been Bloo'd flcd among
them, for they were all very ftRout efoiute Felow-s, to give
them their due.
B u T Providence took more Ca:re to keep them afhndcr,
then they themfilves could do to meet; for, as if they had
dogg'd one another, when the three weree gone thither,
the two were he-re  and afte, wards vwhin the two went
back to find them, the thice we:-e comne to the old Habitation aain; we f- all fee their differing Con dun p:efknitll.
V/hen the three came -ack, like fur iotis Creatu es, fluft d
with the Rage which the MW;ork they had been about put
them into, they came up to the Spagiarcis, and told ti-hem
what they had done, by way of Scoff and B;avadlo; and
one of them flepping up to one of the Spaniards, as if they
had teen a couple of Boys at play, takes hold of his Hat, as
it was upon his Head, and giving it a Twirl about, fleerin his Face, fays he to him, And you, Seignior, Jack Spaniard, ihall have the fame Sauce, if you do not mend your Manners: The Spaniard, who tho' a quiet civil Man, was as
brave, as a Man could be defired to be, and withal a ftrong
well-made Man, lookd fteadily at him for a good while,
and then, having no Weapon in his Hand, ftept gravely up
to him, and with one Blow of his FiR knock'd him down,
as an Ox is felld with a Pole-Ax; at which one of the
Rogues, infolent at the firft, fir'd his PifRol at the Spaniard
immediately; he mifs'd his Body indeed, for the Bullets
went thro' his Hair, but one of them touch'd the tip of his
Ear, and he bled pretty much.' The Blood made the Spaniard believe, he was more hurt than he really was, and
that put him into fome Heat, for before, he ac6ed all in a
perfed&amp; Calm; but now refolving to go thro' his with Work,
he ftoop'd and tooktheFellow's Musket whom lie had knock'd
down, and was juft going to fhoot the Man who had fir'd
at him, when the reft of the Spaniards being in the Cave
come out, and calling to him not to fl-oot, they ftept in,
fecur'd the other two, and took their Arms from them.
W H E N' they we e thus difmarm'd, and found they had
made all the Spaniards their Enemies, as well as their own
Countrymen, they began to cool, and giving the Spaniards
better Words, would have had their Arms again  but the
Spaniards confidering the Feud that was between them and the
other two EglijlDhmen, and that it would be the beRt Method
they



they could take, to keep them from one another, told them
they would do them   no harm, and if they would live
peaccably, they would be very willing to affl an] fociate
with them, as they did biefore, utthat tht tey could not
think of giving them their Arms again, while they appear'd
fo rcfolvd to do Mi/ihicf with them to their owvn Countrvmen, and had even threatned them all, to make theme their
Servants.
TiH E Rogfues were now more capable to hear Reafon,
than to ad6 Reafon, but being refus d their Arms, the) went
raving away, and raging like Madmen, threatning what
they would do, tho' they had no Fire-Ai ms: But the Spaniardl defpiling their Threatning, told them they flculd
take care how they oQfr'd any Injury to their Plantation
or Cattle, for if they did, they would fhoot them as they
would do ravenous Beafts, where-ever they found them
and if they fell into their Hands alive, they flould certainly
be hangd. However, this was far from cooling them
but away they went raging and fwearin like Furies of Hell.
As foon as they were gone, came back the two Men in
Paffion and Rage enough alfo, tho' of another kindi for
having been at their Plantation, and finding it all demolifh'd
and deiroy d, as above, it will eafily be luppos'd they had
Provocation enough; they could fcarce have room to tell
their Tale, the Spaniards were fo eager to tell them theirs?
and it was firange enough to find that Three Men fhould
thus bully Nineteen, and receive no Punifhment at all.
T H. ESpani arts indeed defpifed them, and efpecially having thus difarm'd them, made light of all their Threatnin gs but the two EnglflJmen relolv'd to have their Re.
medy againit them, what Pains foever it coft to find them
out.
B IJ T the Spaniards interpos'd here too, and told them,
that as they were already difarm'd, they could not conctnt
that they (the Two) fhould purfue them with Fire-Arms,
and perhaps kill them; but, faid the grave Spaniard, who
was their Governour, we will endeavour to make them do
you Juftice, if you will leave it to us; for as there is no
doubt but they will come to us again when their Paffion
is over, being not able to fublift without our Affiltance;
we promiie you to make no Peace with them, without
having a full SatisfaCtion for you; and upon this Condition



tion we hope you will prcmife, to ufe no Violence with
them, other than in your own Defence.
THEn two Engljfhmen yielded to this very awkardly, and
with great Relutance, but the Spaniards protefted, they
did it only to keep them from bloodfied, and to make all
eafy at laft; for, faid they, we are not fo many of us, here
is Room enough for us all, and it is great Pity we fhould
not be all good Friends; at length they did conlent, and
Waited for the IfTue of the Thing, living for fome Days
with the spaniards, for their own Habitation was dew
ftroyed.
IN aboult five Days Time the th ee Vagrants, tir'd with
wandring, and almoff fla v'd with -unger, having chiefly
liv'd on Turtles Eggs all that while, came back to the
Grove; and finding my SPnr;ar,         I who, as I have faid,
was the Governour, and two more with him walking by
the Side of the Creek; they came up in a very fubmilfve
humble Manner, and baeg'd to be receiv'd again into the
Family. The Spaniards ufed them civiily, but told them,
they had a&amp;ed bo unnaturally by their Countrymen, and fo
very grofsly by them  (the Spaniards) that they could
not come to any Conclufion, without confulting the two
Englmfhent and the reft but however, they would go to
them and difcourfe about it, and they fhould know in half
an Hour. It may be guefs'd; that they were very hard
put to it, for it feems, as they were to wait this half Hour
for an Anfwer, they begg'd he would fend them out fome
Bread in the mean Time, which he did, and fenit them at
the fame Time a large Piece of Goat's Flefl, and a boil'd
Parrot, which they eat very heartily, for they were hungry
enough.
A F T E R half an Hour's Confultation they were call'd in,
and a long;Debate had about them, their two Countrymen
charging them with the Ruin of all their Labour, and a
Defign to murther them; all which they own'd before,
and therefore could not deny now; upon the whole, the
Spaniards aded the Moderators between them, and as they
had oblig'd the two Englifimen not to hurt the three while
they were naked and unarm'd, fo they now oblig'd the
three to go and rebuild their Fellows two Huts, one to be
of the fame pimenfions, and the other larger than they
were before  alSo to fence their Ground again, where
they



they had pull'd up the Fences, plant Trees in the Ropm
of thofe pull'd up, dig up the Land again for planting
Corn, where they had fpoil'd it; and in a Word, to reflore every Thing in the faIne State as they found it, as
near as they could, for entirely it could not be, the Seafon
for the Corn, and the Growth,of the Trees and Hedges,
not being poffible to be rccov;'d,
W ELL, they fubmitted to alii is; and as they had
Plenty of PRovilors aiven them all the while, they grew
very ordcrly, arnd ci' wxy*hole Society began to live pleaflntIy, and agreeably together aga.in;, only that theie three Fellows could never be pefuaded to work; I mean not for
themselves, except now and then a little, jufi as they pleafed i however, the Spaniards told them plainly, that if they
would but live fociably and friendly together, and ftudy in
the whole the Good of the Plantation, they would be content to work for them, and let them  walk about and be
as idle as they pleas'd, and thus having liv'd pretty well
together for a Month or two, the Spaniards gave them
Arms again, and gave them Liberty to go alroad with
them as before.
I T was not above a Week after they had thefe Arms,
and went abroad, but the ungrateful Creatures began to
be as infolent and troublefome as before; but however,
an Accident happening prefently upon this, which endanger'd the Safety of them all, they were oblig'd to lay by
all private Rei.ntments, and look to the Prefervation of
their Lives.
I T happen'd one Night, that the Sparard Governnour,
as I call him, that is to fay, the Spaniard whofe Life I had
fav'd, who was now the Captain, or Leader, or Govern.
nqur of the reit, found himfelf very uneafy in the Night,
and could by no Means get any Sleep: He was perfe&amp;ly
well in Body, as he told me the Story, only found his
Thoughts tumultuous; his Mind run upon Men fighting,
and killing one another, but was broad awake, and
and could not by any Means get any Sleep; in fhort, he
lay a great while, but growing more and more uneafy, he
refblv'd to rife: As they lay, (eing fo manyof them, upon
Goat-skins, laid thick upon uch Couches, and Pads, as they
made for themielves; and not in Hammocks and Ship.
Beds, as I did, who was but one, fo they had little to dq,
NV1iX



vhei they were willing to rife, but to get up upon their
Feet, and perhaps put on a Coat, fuch as it was, and tkeir
Pumps, and they were ready for going any Way that their
Thoughts guided them.
B EI N G thus gotten up, he look'd out, but being dark,
he could fee little or nothing, and befides, the Trees which
I had planted, as in my former Account is defcribed, and
which were now grown tall, intercepted his Sight, fothat
he could only look up, and fee that it wus a clear Starlight Night, and hearing no Noife, he return'd and laid
him down again; but it was all one, he could not fleep,
nor could he compofe himfelf to any thing like Reft, but
his Thoughts were to the laft Degree uneafy, and yet he
knew not for what.
HA v IN G made fome Noife with riling and walking
about, going out and coming in, another of them wak'd
and calling, ask'd, Who it wasthat was up? The Goveinour
told him, how it had been with him: Say you fo, fays.
the other Spaniard, fuch Things are not to be flighted, I
afUure you; there is certainly fome Mifchief working, fays
he, near us, and prefently he asked him, where are the
Englh/hmen? They areall in their Huts, fays he, fafeenough.
It fCems, the Staniards had kept Poffefflon of the main
Apartment, and had made a Place, where the three EnglifJmen, ince their laft Mutiny, always quarter'd by themtelves, and could not come at the reft. Well, fays the Spa.
niard, there is fomething in it, I am perfuaded from my
own Experience; I am Titisfy'd our Spirits embodied have
a Converfe with, and receive Intelligence from, the Spirits unemnbodied, and inhabiting the invifible World, and
this friendly Notice is given for our Advantage, if we know
how to make ufe of it. Come, fays he, let us go out and
look abroad, and if we find nothing at all in it to iuftify
the Trouble, I'll tell you a Story to the Purpofe, that lliaU
convince you of the Juftice of my propoiing it.
I N a Word, they went out to go to the Top of the,
Hill, where I u4I to go, but they being trong and in
good Comlpany, not alone, as I was, us'd none of my
Cautions, to go up by the Ladder, and then pulling it
up after them, to go up a fecond Stage to the Top, but
were going round through the Grove unconcern'd and unwary, when they were furpriz'd with fieing a Light, as
of



(49 ):of Fire a very little Way off from them, and hearing the
Voices of Men, not of one, or two, but of a gleat Number.
I N all the Difcoveries I had made of the Savages landing on the Ifland, it was my conflant Care to prevent
them making the leaft Difcovery of there being any Inhabitant upon the Place; and when by any Neceflity they
came to know it, they felt it fo effectually, that they that
got away, were fcarce able to give any Account of it,
for we difappear'd as foon as poflible, nor did ever any
that had feen me, efcape to tell any one elfe, except it was
the three Savages in our laft Encounter, who jump'd into
the Boat, of whom I mention'd, that I was afraid they:fhould go Home and bring more Help.
WHE T H E R it was the Confequence of the Efcape of
thofe Men, that fo great a Number came now together;
or whether they came ignorantly and by -Accident on their
ufual bloody Errand, the Spaniards could not it feelns underfland  but whatever it was, it had been their Bufinefs,
either to have conceal'd themfelves, and not to have feen
them at all; much lefs to have let the Savages have feen
that there were any Inhabitants in the Place; But to have
fallen upon them fo effe&amp;ually, as that not a Man of them
fhould have efcap'd, which could only have been by getting in between them and their Boats; but this Pi:eifnce
of Mind was wanting to them, which was the Ruin of
their Tranquility for a great while.
W E need not doubt, but that the Governour and the
Man with him, furpriz'd with this Sight, ran back immediately, and rais'd their Fellows, giving them an Account
of the imminent Danger they were all in; and they again
as readily took the Alarm, but it was impofllble to perfuade them to flay clofe within whe:e they were, but that
they muft run all out to fee how Things flood.
W H I L E it was dark indeed, they were well enough,
and they had Opportunity enough for fome Hours toview
them by the Light of three Fires they had made at fome
Diftance from  one another, what they vwere doing they
knew  not, and what to do themfelves they knew not;
for, firfl, the Enemy were too many; and fccondly, they
did not keep together, but were divided into fevc~al Parties, and were on Shore in fevcral Places.
C                      THE



T HE Spaniards were in no fmall Confernation at this
Sight  and as they found that the Fellows ran ftraggling
all over the Shore, they made no Doubt, but firft or laff,
fonme of them would chop in upon their Habitation, or
upon fome other Place, where they would fee the Tokens
of Inhabitants, and they were in great Perplexity alfo for
fear of their Flock of Goats, which would have been little lefs than flarving them, if they fhould have been defiroy'd; fo the firft Thing they refolv'd upon, was to difpatch three Men away before it was light, viz. two Spaniards and one Englifhman, to drive all the Goats away to
the great Valley where the Cave was, and if Need were,
to diive them into the very Cave it felf.
C O U L D they have feen the Savages altogether in one
Body, and at any Diftance from their Canoes, they refolv'd,
if they had been an hundred of them, to have attack'd
them s but that could not be obtain'd, for they were fome
of them two Miles off from the other, and, as it appear'd
afterwards, were of two different Nations.
A F T ER having mufed a great while on the Courfe
they tlould take, and beaten their Brains in considering
their prefent Circumfiances; they refolv'd at laft, while it
was dark, to fend the old Savage, (Friday's Father) out, as
a Spy, to learn if poffible, fomething concerning them, as
what they came for, and what they intended to do, and
the like; the old Man readily undertook it, and fripping
him felf quite naked, as moft of the Savages were, away
he went: After he had been gone an Hour or two, he
brings Word, that he had been among them undifcover'd,
that he found they were two Parties, and of two feveral
Naticns who had War with one another, and had had
a great Battle in their own Country, and that both
Sides having had feveral Prifoners taken in the Fight, they
were by rmeer Chance landed all in the fame I land, for the
devourirng their Prifoners, and making nmerry; but their
co0mfilg ib by Chance to the fmne Place had fpoil'd alitheir
Mi ti,   at they were:n a g cat Rage atone another, and
that fo  lv,' t.at he  Le icv'd they would fight again,
as foon as Day-lighlt Legan to appear  but he did not perceive that they had any Notion of any body's being on the
Ifland but themfelves. He, had hardly made an End of telling his Story, when they could perceive, by the unufual
Noife



Noife they made, that the two little Armies were engag'd
in a bloody Fight.
Friday's Father uted all the Arguments he could to perfuade our People to lie clofe, and notbe feen; he told them
their Safety confifted in it, and that they had nothing to
do but to lie ftill, and the Savages would kill one another
to their Hands, and the reft would go away; and it was
fo to a Tittle. But it was impoffible to prevail, efpecially
upon the Englifhmen; their Curiofity was fo importunate
upon their Prudentials, that they muft run out and fee the
Battle: However, they ufed fome Caution too, (viz.)
they did not go openly, juft by their own Dwelling, but
went farther into the Woods, and plac'd themselves to Advantage, where they might fecurely fee them manage the
Fight, and, as they thought, not be feen by them; but it
feems the Savages did ice them, as we fllall find hereafter.
THE Battle was very fierce, and if I might believe the
E1nglifJmen, one of them faid, he could perceive, thatfome
of them were Men of great Bravery, of invincible Spirits,
and of great Policy in guiding the Fight. The Battle,
they faid, held two Hours, before they could guefs which
Party would be beaten; but then that Party which was
neareftour People's Habitation began toappear weaket, and
after fome Time more, Lome of them began to fly, and
this put our Men again into a great Conifernation, leftany
of thofe that fled filould-run into the Grove, before their
Dwelling, for Shelter, and thereby involuntarily difcover
the Place; and that by Confequence the Purfuers Should do
the like in Search for them. Upon this they refolv'd that
they would ftand arm'd within the Wall, and whoever came
into the Grove, they fhould fally out over the Wall and
kill them; fo that, if poffible, not one fhould return to
give an Account of it; they order'd alfo, that it flould be
done with their Swords, or by knocking them down with
the Stock of the Musket, but not by hooting them, for
fear of raifing an Alerm by the Noie.
A s they expe(ted, it fell out; three of the routed Army
fled for Life, and, croffing the Creek, ran di ctl1y into
the Place, not in the leaft nowing whether they went,
but running as into a thick Wood for Shelter i te Scout
C                       they



they kept to look Abroad, gave Notice of this within,
with this Addition, to our Mens great SatisfaEtion, (viz.)
That the Conquerors had not purfued them, or feen which
Way they were gone; upon this, the Spaniard Governour,
a Man of Humanity, would not fuffer them to kill the
three Fugitives, but fending three Men out by the Top of
the Hill, order'd them to go round and come in behind
them, furprifeandtake'emPrifoners, which was done; the
Refidue of the conquer'd People fled to their Canoes and
got off to Sea; the ViCors retir'd, and made no Purfuit,
or very little, but drawing themfelves into a Body together, gave two great skreaming Shouts, which they fuppos'd was by Way of Triumph, and fo the Fight ended:
And the fame Day, about three a Clock in the Afternoon,
they alfo marched to their Canoes.  And thus the Spaniards had their Ifland again free to themfelves, their Fright
was over, and they faw no Savages in feveral Years
after.
A F T R they were all gone, the Spaniards came out of
their Den, and viewing the Field of Battle, they found
about two and thirty dead Men upon the Spot I. ome
were kill'd with great long Arrows, fome of which were
found fticking in their Bodies; but moff of them were
kill'd with their great wooden Swords, fixteen or feventeen of which they found in the Field of Battle, and as
many Bows, with a great many Arrows: Thefe Swords
were fiange great unweildy Things, and they muff be
very firong Men that ufed them: Moft of thofe Men that
were kill'd with them, had their Heads mafl'd to pieces,
as we may fay, or, as we call it in EngliJf, their Brains
knock'd out, and feveral their Arms and Legs broken;
fo that 'tis evident they fight with inexpreffible Rage and
Fury: They found not one wounded Man that was not
flone-dead; for either they flay by their Enemy till they
have quite kill'd him, or they carry all the wounded Men,
that aie not qutedead, away with them.
THIS Deliverance tam'd our Enghlijmen for a great
while; the Sight had fill'd them with Horror, and the
Confequences appear'd terrible to the laft Degree, efpecially upon fuppofing that fome Time or other they fhould
fall into the Hands of thofe Creatures, who would not on
ly kill them as Enemies, but kill them for Food, as we
kill



kill our Cattle.  And they profefs'd to me, that the
Thoughts of being eaten up like Beef or Mutton, though
it was fuppos'd it was not to be, till they were dead, had
fomething in it fo horrible, that it naufeated their very
'Stomachs, made them lick when they thought of it, and
fill'd their Minds with fuch unufual Terror, that they were
not thenfelves for fome Weeks after.
T HI s, as I faid, tam'd even the three Englifh Brutes, I
have been fpeaking of; and for a great while after, they
were very tractable, and went about the common Bulfnefs of the whole Society well enough: planted, ifowd,
reap'd, and began to be all naturaliz d to the Country;
But fometime after this, they fell all into fuch limple
Meafures again as brought them  into a great deal of
Trouble.
T H E Y had taken three Prifoners, as I had obfervd, and
thefe three being lufly ftout young Fellows, they made
them Servants, and taught them to work for them; and,
as Slaves, they did well enough; but they did not take
their Meafures with them, as I did by my Man Friady.
Vix. to begin with them upon the Principle of having iaved their Lives, and then inftru6t them  in the ratioral
Principles of Life, much lefs of Religion, civilizing svi
reducing them  by kind Ufage and affectionate Arguirgs;
but as they gave them their Food every Day, fo they ive.
them their Work too, and kept them   fully employ d in
Drudgery enough; but they fail'd in this, by it, that they
never had them to aifift them and fight for them, as I had
my Man Friday, who was as true to me as the very FleflA
upon my Bones.
B U T to come to the Family Part, being all now good
Friends; for common Danger, as I laid above, had effetually reconcild them, they -egan to confider their general
Circumitances; and the firft Thing that came under their
Confiderarion was, Whether, feeing the Savages particularly
haunted that Side of the Ifland, and that there were more
remote and retir'd Parts of it equally adapted to their Way
of Living, and manifeftly to their Advantage, they fhould
not rather remove their Habitation, and plant in fome more
proper Place for their Safety, and efpecially for the Security of their Cattle and Corn?
C.                    UPON



U P ON this, after long Debate, it was concluded, That
they would not remove their Habitation; becaufe that fome
Time or other, they thought they might hear from their
Governour again, meaning me and if I fhould fend any one
to feek them, I fhould be fure to direc them to that Side,
where if they fhould find the Place demolifh'd, they would
conclude the Savages had kill'd us all, and we were gone,
and fo our Supply would go away too.
B  T as to their Corn and Cattle, they agreed to remove
them into the Valley where my Cave was, where the
Land was as proper to both, and where indeed there was
Land enough: However, upon fecond Thoughts, they
altered one Part of their Refolution too, and refolv'd
only to remove Part of their Cattle thither, and plant
Part of their Corn there; and fo if one Part was deftroy'd
the other might be fav'd: And one Part of Prudence they
ufed, which it was very well they did, viz. That they
never trufted thefe three Savages, which they had taken
Prifoners, with knowing any Thing of the Plantation they
had made in that Valley, or of any Cattle they had there;
much lefs of the Cave there, which they kept in Cafe of
Neceffity, as a fafe Retreat, and thither they carried alfo
the two Barrels of Powder, which I had fent them at
my coming away.. u T however they refolv'd not to change their Habitatiwl,yet they agreed, that as I had carefulIy cover'd it firfi
with a Wall or Fortification, and then with a Grove of
Trees; fo, feeing their Safety confifted entirely in their being conceal'd, of which they were now fully convinc'd they
fet to work to cover and conceal the Place yet more effcual'y than before: To this Purpofe, as I had planted
Trees, (or rather thruft in Stakes, which in Time all grew
up to be Trees) for fome good Diftance before the Entranceinto my Apartment, they went on in the fame Manner, and filld up the reft of that whole Space of Ground,.
from the Trees I had fet, quite down to the Side of the
Creek, where, as I faid, I landed my Floats, and even into the very Ouze where the Tide flow'd, not fo much as
leaving any Place to land, or any Sign that there had been
anylanding thereabout: Thee Stakes alfo, being of a Wood
very forward to grow, as I have noted formerry, they took
Care to have generally very much larger and taller than
thret



thofe which I had planted, and placed them fo very thick
and clofe that when they had been three or four Years
grown, there was no piercing with the Eye any conlidcrable Way into the Plantation: As for that Part which
Ihad planted, the Trees were grown as thick as a Man's
Thigh and among them they placed fo many other fhort
ones, and fo thick, that, in a Word, it fRood like a Pallifado, a quarter of a Mile thick, and it was next to inpoffible to penetrate it, but with a little Army to cut it all
down; for a little Dog could hardly get between the Trees,
they flood fo clofe.
B u T this was not all? for they did the fame by all the
Ground to the right Hand, and to the Left, and round even to the Top of the Hill; leaving no Way, not fo much
as for themfelves to come out, but by the Ladder placed
up to the Side of the Hill, and then lifted up, and placed
again from the firft Stage up to the Top  which Ladder,
when it was taken down, nothing but what had Wings
or Witchcraft to affift it, could come at them.
THIS was excellently well contriv'd: Nor was it Icie
than what they afterwards found Occafion for; which
ferv'd to convince me, that as human Prudence has Authority of Providence to jutify it, fo it has, doubtlefs, the
Direction of Providence to fet it to Work; and would we
lifien carefully to the Voice of it, I am fully perfuaded we
might prevent many of the Difafters which our Lives are
now, by our own Neligence, fubjeted to.  But this by
the Way.
I return to the Story. They liv'd two Years after this
in perfet Retirement, and had no more Vifits from the
Savages: They had, indeed, an Alarm  given them one
Mo:-ning which put them into a great Confternation  for
fome of the Spaniards being out carly one Morning on the
Weft Side, or rather End oftfe Ifland,which by the Way, was
that End where I never went, for fear of being difcover'd,
they were furpriz'd with feeing above twenty Canoes of
Indians, juft coming on Shore.
T HE Y made the beft of their Way Home, in Hurry
enough; and giving the Alarm to their Comrades, they
kept clofe all that Day and the next, going out only at
Night, to make Obfervaton: But they had the good Luck
C4-                    to



to be miflaken; for, where-ever the Savages went, they
did not Land at that Time on the Iland, but purfued
ibme other Defign.
AN D now they had another Broil with the three Englifmen; one of which, a moft turbulent Fellow, being in
a Rae atone ofthethree Slaves, which I mentioned they
had takcn, beeaufe the Fellow had not done fomething right
w7hich he bid them do, and feem'd a little untractable in his
fhowing him, drew a Hatchet out of a Frog-Belt, in which
he wore it by his Side, and fell upon the poor Savage, not
to corre&amp; him, but to kill him,  One of the Spaniards,
who was by, feeing him give the Fellow a barbarous Cut
with the Hatchet, which he am'd at his Head but ftruck
into his Shoulder, fo that he thought he had cut the poor
Creature's Arm off, ran to him, and Entreating him not
to Murder the poor Man, clapt in between him and the
Savage, to prevent the Michief.,
T uIE Fellow being enrag'd the more at this, firuck at
the Spaniard with his Hatchet, and fwore he would ferve
him as he intended to ferve the Savage; which the Spaniard perceiving, avoided the Blow, and with a Shovel
which he had in his Hand, (for they were working in
the Field about their Corn-Land) knocked the Brute down:
Another of the Engliljmen running at the fame Time to
help his Comrode, knock'd the Spaniard down; and then
two Spa$iards more came   to help their Man, and a
third EEngZlJman fell upon them. They had none of them
any Fire-Arms, or any other Weapons but Hatchets and
other Tools, except this third Englifhman; he had one of
my old rufty Cutlaihes, with which he made at the laff Spani.
Ards, and wounded them both: This Fray fet the whole
Family in an Uproar, and more Help coming in, they
took the three Englijfmen Prifoners.  The next Queftion
was, What thould be done with them? they had been fo
often mutinous, and were fo furious, fo defperate, and fo
idle whithal, that they knew not what Courfe to take
with them   for they were mifchievous to the heigheft '
Degree, and valued not what Hurt they did any Man;
fo that, in fhort, it was not fafe to live with them.
T HE Spaniard, who was Governour, told them in fo
many Words, That if they had been his own Countryhe
would have hang'd them. all.; for all Laws and all Gover


nours were to preferve Society and thofe who were dangerous to the Society, ought to be expell'd out of it but
as they were Englifhmen, and that it was to the generous
Kindnefs of an Englijhman that they all ow'd their Prefervation and Deliverance, he would ufe them with all pol
fible Lenity, and would leave them to the Judgment of
the other two Englifhmen, who were their Countrymen.
O N E of the two honeft Englifmen flood up, and faid,
they defir'd it might not be left to them; for, fays he, I
am fure we ought to Sentence them to the Gallows; and
with that gives an Account how  William Atkins, one of
the three, had propofed to have all the five Engli/ljmen
join together, and Murther all the Spaniards.when they were
in their Sleep.
W H E N the Spani/h Governour heard this, he calls toWill.
Ackins, How, Seignior Atkins, fays he, would you Murther us all? What have you to fay to that? That hardened
Villian was fo far from denying it, that he iaid it was
true, and G-d d âmn him they would do it Itil before they
had done with them. Well, but Seignior Atkins, fays
the Spaniard, What have we done to you, that you will
kill us? And what would you get by killing us? And
what muft we do to prevent your killing us? Muft we
kill you, or you will kill us? Why will you put us to the
Ncceffity of this, Seignior Atkins? fays the Spaniard very
calmly, and fmiling.
SE IGNIOR Atkins was in fuch a Rage at the Span:ard's making a Jeft of it, that had he not been held by
three Men, and withal had no Weapons with him, it was
thought he would have attempted to have kil'd the Spaniard in the tuiddle of all the Company.
THI s hair-brain'd Carriage oblig'd them  to confider
ferioufly what was to be done. The two Englijhmen and
the Spaniard who fav'd the poor Savage, was of the 0 -pinion, that they fhould hang one of the three for an Example to the reft, and that, Particularly, it fhould be he that
had twice attempted to commit Murder with his Hatcheti
and indeed there was fome Reafon to believe he had done
it, for the poor Savage was in fuch a miserable Condition with the Wound he had received, that it was thought
AI could not live.
C -;                 B V'



B U T the Governour Spaniard flill faid No, it was an.Xngifhiman that had fiv'd all their Lives, and he would
never Confent to put an EngliIhmn4to Death, tho' he had:
murther'd half of them; nay, he faid, if he had been kill'd
himfef by an EglJfhman, and had Time left to Speak, it
Thould be, that they fhould pardon him.
T HI s was fo pofitively infifted on by the Governour
Spaniard, that there was no gainfaying it? and as mercifut Councils are moft apt to prevail where they are fo
earnefily prefs'd fo they all came into it; but then it was to
be confider'd, what fhould be done to keep them from doing
the Mifchiefthey defign'd; for all agreed, Governour and ah1,
that Means were to be ufcd for preferving the Society
from  Danger; after a long Debate it was agreed, Firft,
That they fhould be difarm'd, and not permitted to have
either Gun., or Powder, or Shot, or Sword, or any Weaor, andt ifoukM be turn'd out of the Society, and left to
five where they would, and how   they would by themfdsve.s; but that none of the reft, either Sprniards or Engiod converfe with them, fpeak with them, or have
any Thing to d&amp; with them; that they fhould be forbid
to come Iwithin a certain Diftance of the Place where the
ef dwelt; and that if they offer'd to commit any Difor&amp;r, fo as to fpoil, burn, kill, or deftroy any of the Corn,.
Fintings^ Buiilings,_ Fences, or Cattle belonging to the Society, that they fhould die without Mercy, and they fhould
Shoot them wAere-ever they could find them.
THE Governour, a Man of great Humanity, muting
upon the Sentence, confider'd a little upon it, and turning
to the two honeft Euglihjmen fiid, Hold; you muft refled,
that it will be long e'er they can raife Corn and Cattle of
their own and they mufft not ftarve5 We muft therefore
allow them Provifions, fo he caus'd to be added, That they
fhould have a Proportion of Corn given them to laft them
tight Months, and for Seed to fow, by which Time they
mnight be lippos'd to raife Come of their own-; that they
hnoud have fix Milch-Goats, four He-Goats, and fix Kids
given them, as welt for prefent Subfiftence, as for a Store;
and that they fhouk have Tools given them for their Work
in the Fields; ifuckh as, fix Hatchets, an Ax, a Saw, and the
hke: But they fould have none of thefe Tools or Piovi-foms, uale they woul&amp; fwear folemnly, that they would
not



ot- hurt or injure any'of the spaniards with them, or of
their Fellow Englishmen.
T i u s they difmifs'd them the Society, and turnd them
out to fhift for themfelves. They went away fullen and
refraftory, as neither contented to go away, or to flay;
but, as there was no Remedy, they went, pretending to
go and chute a Place where they would fettle themfelves to plant and live by themfelves; and fome Provifions were given them, but no Weapons.
AB OU T our or five Days after, they came again for
fome Vi&amp;uals, and gave the Governour an Account where
they had pitch'd their Tents, and mark'd themfelves out
an Habitation and Plantation; and it was a very convenient Place indeed, on the remotelt Part of the Ifland, N. E.
much about the Place where I providentially landed in my
firit Voyage, when I was driven out to Sea, the Lord
alone knows whether, in my foolifh Attempt to furround
the Ifland.
H E RE they built themfelves two handfome T-uds, and
cpntriv'd them, in a Manner, like my firft Habitation,
being clofe under the Side of a Hill, having fome Trees
growing already on the three Sides of it, fo that by planting others, it would be very eafily cover'd from the Sight,
unlefs narrowly fearch'd for; they defir'd fomedryd Goatsskins for Beds and Covering, which were given them;
and upon giving their Words, that they would notdifturb
the reft, or injure any of their Plantations, they gave them
Hatchets, and what other Tools they could fpare; ibme
Peas, Barley, and Rice, for fowing, and, in a Word, any
Thing they wanted, but Arms andTAmmunition.
TH.E Y liv'd in this feperate Condition about fix Monthsi
and had gotten in theit firft Harvefl, tho' the Quantity was
but fmal, the Parcel of Land they had plantea being hut
little; for indeed, having all their Plantation to form, they
had a great deal of Work upon their Hands; and when
they came to make Boards, and Pots, and fuch Thlingr,
they were quite out of their Element, and could make
nothing of it; and when the rainy Seafon came on, for
want of a Cave in the Earth, they could not keep their
Grain dry, and it was in great Danger of fpoiling: And
this humbled them much; fo they came and berg'd the
Siaiards to help them, which they very readily did; and



uifour Days work'd a great Hole in the Side of, t&amp;te Mit
for thcm, big enoug to fecure their Corn, and other Things
from the Rain;i, but it was but a poor Place, at heft, cornFai~'d to mine; i and efpecially as mine was then, for the

B3 u -r I Invet,4frving,, and return., to the Story: â The
three Fellows- came Idown to the Spaniards one Morning,4~very hutbkcTerms- deiir'4 to. be.. admaitted to fpeli



with them: The Spaniards very readily heard what they
had to fay, which was this, That they were tir'd of living in the Manner they did; that they were not handy
enough to make the Neceflaries they wanted; and that
having no Help, they found they fhould be ftarv'd: But
if the Sponiards would give them Leave to take one
of the Canoes which they came over in, and give them
Arms and Ammunition, proportion'd for their Defence,
they would go over to the Main, and feek their Fortune,
and fo deliver them from the Trouble of fupplying them
with any other Provifions.
TH E Spaniards were glad enough to be rid of them,
but yet very honeftly reprefented to them the certain Deftiuftion they were running into; told them, they had
fuffer'd fuch Hardfhips upon that very Spot, that they
could, without any Spirit of Prophefy, tell them, that
they would be flarv'd, or murther'd, and bad them conider of it.
T HE Men reply'd audacioufly, they fhould be flarv'd if
they flay'd here, for they could not work, and would not.
wo-rk  and they could but be flarv'd Abroad, and if
they were murther'd, there was an End of them, they had
no Wives or Chileren to cry after them, and in fhort,
infifLed importunately upon Their Demand, declring, that
they would go, whether they would give them any Arms
or no,
THE Spaniards told them, with great Kindnefs, that if
they were refolv'd to go, they fl:ould nor go like naked
Men, and be in no Condition to defend themi:lves; and that
though they could ill fpare their Fire-Arms, having not
enough for themfclves, yet they would let them have two
Muskets, a Piftol, and a Cutlafh, and each Man a HIatchet,
which they thought was fufficient for them.
IN a Word, they accepted the Offer, and having bakedthem Bread enough to ferve them a Month, and given them
as much Goats-Flefh as they could eat while it was iweet,
and a great Basket full of dry'd Grapes, a Pot full of fieih
Water, and a young Kid alive to kill, they boldly fet outin a Canoe for a Voyage over the Sea, where it was atleaft 4o Miles broad.
T aE Boat was indeed a large one, and would have'
very wellcarry'd fifteen ot twenty Mcn 3 and,. therefore,
was.



was rather too big for them to manage: But as they had
a fair Breeze, and the Flood-Tide with them, they did
well enough: They had made a Maft of a long Pole, and
a Sail of four large Goat-skins dry'd, which they had fow'd
or lac'd together: and away they went merrily enough;
the Spaniards call'd after them, Bon Veyajo.; and no Man
ever thought of feeing them any more.
THE Spaniards would often fay one to another, and
the two honeft Englifhmen who remain'd behind, how
quietly and comfortably they liv'd now thofe three turbulent Fellows were gonei as for their ever coming again,
that was the remoteft Thing from their Thoughts that
could be imagin'd  when behold, after two and twenty
Days Abfence, one of theEngli/hmen being abroad upon his
Plinting-Work, fees three firange Men coming toward him
at a Diffance, two of them with Guns upon their Shoulders.
A WA Y runs the Englrfhman, as if he was bewitchd,
and came frighted and amaz'd to the Governour Spaniard,
and tells him they wereall. undone, for there were Strangers
landen upon the Ifland, he could not tell who: The Spaniard, paufing a while, fays to him, How do you mean,.
you cannot tell -who? They are the Savages to be fure;
No, no, fays the Englifhman, they are Men in Cloaths
with Arms: Nay, then, fays the Spaniard, why are you
concern'd? If they are not Savages they muft be Friends,
for there is no Chriftian Nation upon Earth but will do
us Good rather than Harm.
W H I L E they' were debating thus, comes the three Engz
tifhmen, and hfanding without the Wood, which was new
planted, hallb'd to them; they prefently knew their Voiees,
and fo all the wonder of that kind ceas'd. But now the
Admiration was turn'd upon another Queftion, ( viz ) what
could be the Matter, and what made them come back
again?
I T was not long before they brought the Men in, and
enquiring where they had been, and what they had been
doing, they gave them a full Account of their Voyage in
a few Words, (vsiz) That they reach'd the Land in two
Days, or Something Iefs, but finding the People alarmed at
their coming, and preparing with Bows and Arrows to
fight them, they durft not go on Shore, but fail'd on to the
'orthward fix-or fevea Hours, tilt they came to a great
Opening,



Opening, by whichthey perceiv'd, that the Land they faw
from our Ifland was not the Main, but an Ifland; that entring that Opening of the Sea, they faw another Ifland on
the Right Hand. North, and feveral more Weft; and being
refolv'd to land fomewhere, they put over to one of the
Iflands which lay Weft, and went boldly on Shore; that
they found the People very courteous and friendly to them,
and they gave the m  feveral Roots and fome dry'd Fifi,
and appear'd very fbciable; and the Women, as well as the
Men, were very forward to fupply them with any thing
they could get for them to eat, and brought it to them a
great Way upon their Heads.
T H EY continu'd here four Days, and enquir'd, as well
as they could of them, by Signs, what Nations were this
Way, and that Way; and were told of feveral fierce and
terrible People that liv'd almoft every Way; who, as they
made known by Signs to them, ufed to eat Men; but as
for themfelves, they faid that they never eat Men or Women, except only fuch as they took in the Wars, and
then they own'd that they made a great Feaft, and eat
their Prifoners.
THE EnglifZmen enquir'd when they had a Feaft of
that Kind, and they told them two Moons ago, pointing
to the Moon, and then to two Fingers; and that their
great King had two hundred Prifoners now, which he had
taken in his War; and they were feeding them to make
them fat, for the next Feaft.  The Englibmen feem'd
mighty defirous to fee thofe Prifoners, but the other miflaking them, thought they were defirous to have fome of
them, to carry away for their own eating.  So they
beckon'd to them, pointing to the Setting ofthe Sun, and
then to the Riling, which was to fignify, that the next
Morning at Sun-rifing they would bring fome for them;
and accordingly the next Morning they brought down five
Women and eleven Men, and gave them to theEnglifhmen,
to carry with them on their Voyage, jufi as we would
bring fo many Cows and Oxen down to a Sea-Port Town,
to victual a Ship.
A s brutifh and barbarous as thefe Fellows were at home,
their Stomachs turrn d at this Sight, and they did not know
what to do; to refufe the Prifoners, would have been the
hgheft Affront to the favage Gentry that offer'd them;
and



and what to do with them, they knew not; howeves
upon fome Debates, they refolved to accept of them, and
mi Return, they gave the Savages that brought them, one
of their Hatchets, an old Key, a Knife, and fix or feven
of their Bullets, which, though they did not underhand,
they feem'd extreamly pleas'dwith: And then, tying the
poor Creatures Hands behind them, they ( the People)
dragg'd the Prifoners into the Boat for our Men.
T H E EngliJhmen were oblig'd to come away as foon
as they had them, or elfe they that gave them this noble
Prefcnt, would certainly have expe&amp;ed that they fhould
have gone to work with them, have kill'd two or three
of them the next Morning, and perhaps have invited the
Donors to Dinner.
Bu T having taken their Leave with all the Refpeds,
and Thanks that could well pafs between People, where
on either Side they underftood not one Word they could
fay, they put off with their Boat, and came back towards
the firft Ilandj where when they arriv'd, they fet eight of
their Prifoners at Liberty, there being too many of them.
for their Occafions.
IN their Voyage, they endeavour'd to have fome Communication with their Prifoners, but it was impoffi!le to
make them underfiand any Thing; Nothing they could
fay to them, or give them, or do for them, but was look'd
upon as going about to murther them: They firft of all unbound them, but the poor Creatures skream'd at that,
efpecialy the Women, as if they had juft felt the Knife at
their Throats; for they immediately concluded, they were
unbound on Purpofe to be kill'd.
I F they gave them any Thing to eat, it was the fame
Thing; then they concluded it was for Fear they flould
fink in Flefb, and fo not be fat enough to kill: If they
look'd at one of them more particularly, the Party prefently concluded, it was to fee whether he or fhe was fateft, and fitteft to kill firf  Nay, after they had brought
them quite over, and began to f1e them kindly, and treat
them well, ftill they expe6ted every Day, to make a Dinner or Supper for their new Maiters.
WH EN the three Wanderers had given this unaccountile Hilfory, or Journal of their Voyage, the Splniard ask'd
iThext~3



them, Where their new Family was? And being told that
they had brought them on Shore, and put them into one of
their Huts, and were come up to beg fome Vi&amp;uals for them;
they (the Spaniards) and the other two Englii/hmen, that is
to iay, the whole Colony, refolv'd to go all down to the
Place and fee them, and did fo, and Friday's Father with
them.
W HEt   they came into the Hut, there they fate all
bound; for when they had brought them on Shore, they
bound their Hands that they might not take the Boat and
make their Efcape; there, I fay, they fate, all of them
flark naked: Firfl, There were three Men, lufty comely
Fellows, well-flap'd, ftrait and fair Limbs, about 3 o0 to thirty
five Years of Age; and five Women, whereof two might
be from thirty to forty, two more not above four or five
and twenty, and the fifth, a tall comely Maiden about fixteen or feventeen: The Women were well-favoured agreeble Perfons, both in Shape and Features, only tawny, and
two of them, had they been perfe&amp; White, would have
pafs'd for very handfome Women, even in London it felf;
having very pleafant agreeable Countenances, and of a very
modec Behaviour, efpecially when they came afterwards
to be cloath'd, and drefs'd, as they call d it, tho' that Drefs
was very indifferent it muft be confefs'd; of which hereo
after.
T H E Sight, you may be fure, was fomething uncouth
to our Spaniards, who were (to give them a juft Chara&amp;er)
Men of the bell Behaviour; of the molt calm, fedate Tenmpers, and perfeCt Good-humour that ever I met with
and in particular, of the mofl Modefly, as will presently appear: I lay, the Sight was very uncouth, to fee two naked
Men, and five naked Women, all together bound, and in the
mofl miserable Circumflances that human Nature could be
fuppos'd to be, viz. to be expeting every Moment to be
dragg'd out, and have their Brains knock'd out, and
then to be eaten up like a Calf that is kill'd for a
Dainty.
TH E firft Thing they did, was to caufe the old Indian,
Friday's Father, 'to go in and fee firft if he knew any
of them; and then, if he underftood any of their
Speech: As foon as the old Man came in, he look'd
'fcrioufly at them, but knew none of them, neither could
any



ny of them underftand a Word he faid, or a Sign he could
make, except one of the Women.
Ho w E v E R, this was enough to anfwer the End, which
was to iatisfy them, that the Men into whofe Hands they
were fallen, were Chriftians i that they abhorr'd eating of
Men or Women, and that they might be fure they would
not be kill'd:. As foon as they were aflur'd of this, they
difcover'd fuch a Joy, and by fuch aukward, and feveral
ways, as is hard to defcribe; for it feems they were of feveral Nations.
THE Woman, who was their Interpreter, was bid itn,
the next Place to ask them, If they were willing to be
Servants, and to work for the Men who had brought them
away, to five their Lives? at which they all fell a Dancing   and prefently one fell to taking up this, and another
that, any Thing that lay next, to carry on their Shoulders,
to'intimate that they were wiling to work.
T HE Governour, who found, that the having Women
among them would prefently be attended with fome Inconvenience, and might occafion fome Strife, and perhaps
Blood; ask'd- the three Men, what they intended to do
with thefe Women, and how they intended to ife them;
whether as Servants, or as Women? One of the EngliJhmen anfwer'd very boldly and readily, That they would
ufe them as both. To which the Governour faid, I am
not going to reftrain you from it, you are your own
Maiters as to that: But this I think is but juff, for avoiding Diforders and Quarrels among you; and I deiire it of
you, for that Reafon only, viz. That you will all engage,
that if any of you take any of thiee Women, as a Woman or Wife, that he flall take but one; and that having
taken one, none elfe iould touch her; for tho' we cannot
marry any of you, yet 'tis but reafonable, that while you
itay here, the Women any of you takes, fould be maintain'd
by the Man that takes her, and 1Fould be his Wife; I mean,
fiys he, while he continues here, and that none elie fhould
have any thing to do with her: All this appear'd ~o jult,
that every one agreed to it without any Difficulty.
T H EN the Englifhmen ask'd the Spaniards, If they defign'd to take any of them? But every one anfwer'd
NO: Some of them Laid, they had Wives in Spain, -id
and the others did not like Women that were not Chriftigns iA



Ins; and altogether declar'd, that they would not touch
one of them  which was an Inftance of fuch Virtue, as
I have not met with in all my Travels; On the other
Hand, to be lhort, the five Englifhmen took them every
one a Wife, that is to fay, a temporary Wife; and fo they
fet up a new Form of Livin g for the Spaniards and Frid4y's
Father liv'd in my old Habitation, which they had enlarg'd exceedingly within; the three Servants which they had taken
in the late Battle of the Savages, liv'd with them; and
thefe carried on the main Part of the Colony, fupplying
all the reft with Food, and afiiUing them in any Thing as
they could, or as they found Neceifity requird.
B u T the Wonder of this Story was, how five fuch refraatory ill-match'd Fellows flould agree about thefe Woo
men, and that two of them flould not pitch upon the
fame Woman, efpecially feeing two or three of them were,
without Comparifon, more agreeable than the other: But
they took a good Way enough toprevent quarrellingamong
themfelves; for they fet the five Women by themselves in
one of their Huts, and they went all into the other Hut,
and drew Lots among them, who fhould chufe firft.
H E that drew to chufe firft, went away by himfelf to
the Hut where the poor naked Creatures were, and fetch'd
out her he chofi; and it was worth obferving, that he
that chore firft took her that was reckon'd the homelieft,
and the oldeft of the five, which made Mirth enough
among the reft and even the Spaniards laugh'd at it: but
the Fellow confider'd better than any of them, that it was
Application and Bufnefs that they were to expe&amp; Afiftance
in, as much as any Thing elfe; and fhe prov'd the bef
Wife of all the ParcelW HE N the poor Women faw themfelves fet in a Row'
thus, and fetch'd out one by one, the Terrors of their Condition return'd upon them again, and they firmly believ'd
that they were now a going to be devour'd: Accordingly,
when the Englifhi Sailor came in and iitch'd but one of
them, the reft fet up a moft lamentable Cry, and hung
about her, and took their Leave of her with fuch Agonies
and fuch Affetion, as would have griev'd the hardeft Heart
in the World nor was it poffible for the Englithmen to fatisf them, that they were not to be immediately murther', till they fetch'd the old Man, Friday's Father, who
imO*L



`bmediately let them know, that the five Men, who had
fetch'd them out one by one, had chofen them for their
Wives,
WHEN they had done this, and the Fright the Women were
in was a little over, the Men went to work, and the Spaniards came and help'd them; and in a few Hours they had
built them every one a new Hut or Tent fbr their Lodging
apart; for thofe they had already, were crowded with their
Tools, Houfhold-Stuff, and Provifions: The three wicked
Ones had pitch'd fartheft off,. and the two honeft Ones
nearer, but both on the North Shore of the Ifland, fo that
they continued feparate as before: And thus my Ifland was
peopled in three Places; and as I might fay, Three Towns
were begun to be planted.
AND here 'tis very well worth obferving, That as it
often happens in the World (what the wife Ends of God's
Providence are in fuch a Difpofition of Things, I cannot
fay) the two honeft Fellows had the two worft Wives,
and the three Reprobates, that were fcarce worth hanging,
that were fit for nothing, and neither feem'd born to do
themfelves Good, -or any one elfe, had three clever, diligent, careful, and ingenious Wives  not that the two firit
were ill Wives, as to their Temper or Humour; for allthe
five were moft willing, quiet, paffive, and fubjeCted Creatures, rather like Slaves than Wives  but my Meaning is,
they were not alike capable, ingenious, or induftrious, or
alike cleanly and neat.
ANOTHER Obfervation I muft make, to the Honour of
a diligent Application on one Hand, and to the Difgrace of
a flothful, negligent, idle Temper, on the other, that when
I came to the Place, and viewedthe feveral Improvements,
Plantings, and Management of the feveral little Colonies;
the two Men had ~o far out-gone the three, that there was
no Comparifon; they had indeed both of them as much
Ground laid out for Corn as they wanted; and the Reafon
was, becaufe, according to my Rule, Naturedilated, that
it was to no Purpofe to fow more Corn than they wanted, but the Difference of the Cultivation, of the Planting,
of the Fences, and indeed every Thing elfe was eafy t  e:
feen at firit Viw.
THE two Men had innumerable young Treesplanted
about their Huts, that when you came to the Place. no
thing,



thing was to be feen but a Wood, and tho' they had
twice their Plantation demiolnfh'd, once by their own
Countrymen and once by the Enemy, as ft-all be fhewn
in its Place; yet they had teftoi'd all again, and every
Thing was thriving and flouriffing about them+; they
had' Grapes planted in Order and manag'd like a Vineyard, tho' they had themfelves never feen any Thing of
that Kind; and by their good ordering their Vines, their
Grapes were as good again as any of the others. They
had allb found themselves out a Retreat in the thickeft
Part of the Woods, where, though there was not a natural Cave, as I had found, yet they made one with incefant Labour of their Hands, and where when the Mifchief
which follow'd happend, they fecur'd their Wives and
Children, fo as they could never be found they having by
flicking innumei able Stakes and Poles of the Wood, which
as I faid, grew fo eafily, made the Grove unpaflable, except
in ome Places, where they climb'd up to get over the outtide Part; and then went in by Ways of their own leaving.
A s to the three Reprobates, as I juftly call them, tho'
they were much civiliz'd by their new Settlement, compar'd to what they were before, and were not fo quarelIfome, having not the fame Opportunity; Yet one of the
certain Companions of a proflagate Mind never left them,
W and that was their Idlenefs: It is true, they planted.Corn,
and made Fences; but Solomon's Words were never better
verified than in them: I went by the Vineyard of the Sloath.
ful, aid it was all over-gromwn with Thorns; for when the
Spaniards came to view their Crop, they could not fee it
in fome Places for Weeds; the Hedge had feveral Gaps
in it, where the wild Goats had gotten in, and eaten up
the Corn,; perhaps, here and there, a dead Bufh was
cramm'd in, to flop them out for the prefent, but it was
only fputting the Stable Door after the Steed was ftoln.
Whereas, wien they look'd on the Colony of the other
two, there was ithe very Face of Induftry and Succefs
upon all they did; there was not a Weed to be feen in all
their Corn, or a Gap in any of their Hedges, And they
on the other Hand verify d Solomon's Words in another
Place, That the diligent Hand makes rich  for every Thing
grew and thriv'd, and they had Plenty within and withouti they had more tame Cattle than the other, more
Utenfils



Utenfils and Neceflaries within Doors, and yet more
Pleafure and Diverfion too.
I T it true, the Wives of the three, were very handy
and cleanly within Doors, and having learn'd the Englifh
Ways of Dreffing and Cooking from  one of the other
Englifhmen, who, as I faid, was Cook's-Mate on board
the Ship, they drefs'd their Husbands Vi6tuals very nicely
and well; whereas the other could not be brought to
underRfand it; but then the Husband, who, as I laid, had
been Cook's-Mate, did it himfelf; but as for the Husbands of
the three Wives, they loiter'd about, fetch'd Turtels Eggs,
and caught Fifh and Birds; in a Word, any Thing but. Labour, and they far'd accordingly. The Diligent liv'd well
and comfortably, and the Slothful liv'd hard and beggarly;
and fo I believe, generally fpeaking, it is all over the
World.
BuT now I come to a Scene, different from all that
had happen'd before, either to them, or to met and the
Original of the Story was this:
E A R L Y one Morning there came on Shore five or fix
Canoes of Indians, or Savages, call them which you pleafe;
and there is no room to doubt that they came upon the
old Errand of feeding upon their Slaves: But that Part was
now fo familiar to the Spaniards, and to our Men too,
that they did not concern themfelves about it, as I did;
but having been made fenfible by their Experiences, that
their only, Bufinefs was to lie conceal'd, and that if they
were not feen by any of the Savages, they would go off
again quietly when their Bufinefs was done, having as yet
not the leaft Notion of there being any Inhabitants in the
Illand; I fay, having been made ienfible of this, they had
nothing to do but to give Notice to all the three Plantations, to keep within Doors, and not fhew  themfelves,
only placing a Scout in a.proper Place, to give Notice
when the Beats-went off to Sea again.
THIS was without Doubt very right; but a Difafter
fpoil'd all there Meafures, and made it known among the
Savages, that there were Inhabitants there, which was
in the End the Defolation of almoit the whole Colony, after
tthe Canoes with the Savag.es were gone off, the Spaniards
peep'd abroad again, and Ibme of them had the Curiofity
to go to the Place where they had been, to fee what they
had



had been doing: Here, to their great Surpize, they found
three Savages left behind, and lying faft afleep upon the
Ground; it was fuppos'd, they had either been lb gorg'd
with their inhuman Feaft, that, likeBeafts, they were a.
fleep, and would not flir when the others went, or they
were wander'd into the Woods, and did not come back
in Time to be taken in,
THE Spaniards were greatly furpriz'd at this Sight,
and perfealy at a Lofs wiat to do; the Spaniard Governour, as it happen'd, was with them, and his Advice was
ask'd, but he profefs'd he knew not what to do; as for
Slaves, they had enough already, and as to killing them,
they were none of them inclin'd to that: The Spaniard Governour told me, they could not think of fhedding innocent Blood, for as to them, thepoor Creatures had done no
Wrong, invaded none of their Property, and they thought
they had no juft Quarrel againft them, to take away their
Lives.
AND here I muff, in Juffice to thefe Spaniards, obferve, that let the Accounts of Spanif Cruelty in Mexico
and Peru, be what they will, I never met with feventeen
Men of any Nation whatfoever, 'in any Foreign Country,
who were fo univerfally Modeft, Temparate, Virtuous,
fo very good Humour'd, and fo Courteous as thefe Spaniards, and as to Cruelty they had nothing of it in their
very Nature; no Inhumanity, no Barbarity, no outragaous Paffions, and yet all of them Men of great Courage
and Spirit.
Their Temper and Calmnefs had appear'd, in their
bearing the unfufferable Ufage of the three Englif/men;
and their Juftice and Humanity appear'd now in the Cafe
of the Savages, ai above: After fome Confultation, they
rcfolv'd upon this, that they would lie ftill a while longer,
'till, if poffible, thefe three Men might be gone; but then
the Governour Spaniard recolle&amp;ed, that the three Savages
i had no Boat, and that if they were left to rove about the
Ifland, they would certainly diicover that there were Inhabitants in it, and fo they fhould be undone that Way.
U   o N this, they went back again, and there lay the
Fellows faft afleep fill, fo they refolv'd to waken them,
and take them Prifoners, and they did fo; the poor Fellows were ftrangely fiighted when they were feiz'd upon
and



and bound, and afraid, like the Women, that they Miould
be murther'd and eaten; for it feems thofe People think all
the World do as they do, eating Mens Flefh; but they
were foon made eafy as to that, and away they carry'd
them.
IT was very happy to them that they did not carry
them Home to their Cafile. I mean to my Palace under
the Hill; but they carry d them firif to the Bower, where
was the chief of their Country-work, fuch as the keeping the Goats, the planting the Corn, &amp;c. and afterwards,
they carried them to the Habitation of the two Engli/h
men.
H ERE they were fet to work, tho' it was not much
they had for them to do: and whether it was by Negligence in guarding them, or that they thought the Fellows could not mend themfelves, I know 'not, but one
of them run away, and taking into the Woods, they could
never hear of him more,
THEY had good Reafon to believe he got Home again
ioon after, in fome other Boats or Canoes of Savages,
who came on Shore three or four Weeks afterwards, and
who, carrying on their Revels as ufual, went off again in
two Days time: This Thought terrify'd them cxceedingly; for they concluded, and that not without good
Caufe indeed, that if this Fellow came fafe Home among
his Comrades, he would certainly give them an Account that there were People in the Ifland, as alfo how
few and weak they were; for this Savage, as I obferv'd
before, had never been told, and it was verry happy he
had not, how many they were, or where they liv'd; nor
had he ever feen or heard the Fire of any of their Guns,
much lefs had they fhewn him any of their other retir'd
Places, iuch as the Cave in the Valley, or the new Retreat which the two Engli/men had made, and the like.
T HE firft Teftimony they had that this Fellow had given Intelligence of them, was, that about two Months
after this, fix Canoes of Savages, with about feven, or
eight, or ten Men in a Canoe, came rowing along the
North-fide of the Ifland, where they never ufed to come
before, and landed about an Hour after Sun-rife, at a convenient Place, about a Mile from the Habitation of the two
Ernglijmen,where this efcap'd Man had been kept: As the
Spaniards



Spaniard Govenour faid, had they been all there, the IDa
mage would not have been fo much, for not a Man of
them would have efcap'd but the Cafe differ'd now very
much, for two Men to fifty were too much Odds: The
two Men had the Happinefi to difcover them about a
League off, fo that it was above an Hour before they
landed, and as they landed about a Mile from their Huta,
it was Come time before they could come at them: Now
having great Reafon to believe that they were betray'd,
the irft Thing they did, was to bind the Slaves which
were left, and caufe two of the three Men, who they
brought with the Women,who it feems prov'd very faithful
tothem, to lead them with theirtwo Wives, and whatever
they could carry away with them, to their retir'd Place
in the Woods, which I have fpoken of above, and there
to bind the two Fellows, Hand and Foot, till they heard
farther.
I N the next Place, feeing the Savages were all come on
Shore, and that they bent their Courfe dire6tly that Way,
they open'd the Fences where their Milch-Goats were
kept, and drove them all out, leaving their Goats to ftraggle into the Wood, whither they pleas'd, that the Savages might think they were all bred wild  but the Rogue
who came with them was too cunning for that, and gave
them an Account of it all; for they went dire6Ily to the
Place.
WHE N the two poor frighted Men hadifecur'd their
Wives and Goods, they fent the other Slave they had of
the three, who came with the Women, and who was
at their Place by Accident, away to the Spaniards, with
all Speed, to give them the Alarm, and defire fpeedy Help;
and in the mean Time they took their Arms, and what
Ammunition they had, and retreated towards the Place in
the Wood, where their Wives were Cent, keeping at a
Diftance, yet fo that they might fee, if poffible, which
way the Savages took.
T H  Y had not gone far, but that, from a rifing Ground,
they could -ee the little Army of their Enemies come on
directly to their Habitation, and in a Moment more, could
fe all their Huts and Houfhold Stuff flaming up together, to their great Grief and Mortification,or they had
4 verygreat Lots, and to them irretrievable,.atleaft for Come
ID                    Timad



c 74,Time.   They kept their Station fai a while, 'till they
found the Savages, like wild Beafts, fpread themfelves all
over the Place, rumaging every Way, and every Place they
could think of, in fearc for Prey, and-in particular for the
People, of whom it now plainly appear'd they had Intelligence.
The two DEnglbljmen feeing this, thinking themfelves
not fecure where they ftood, becaufe as it was likely fbme
of the wild People might come that Way, fo they might
come too many together, thought it proper to make another Retreat about half a Mile Tarther, believing, as it afterwards happen'd, that the farther they firoil'd, the fewer would be together.
T H E next Halt was at the Entrance into a very thick
grown Part of the Woods, and where an old Trunck of
a Tree flood, which was hollow and vaftly large; and in
this Tree they both took their flanding, refolving to ee
there what might offer.
THEY had not flood there long, but two of the Savages appear'd running diretly that Way, as if they had
i;eady had Notice where they ftood, and were coming up to
attack them; anda little Way fariher, they fpy'd three more
comingafter them, and five morebeyond them, allcoming the
fame Way; befides which, they faw feven or eight more at a
Diftance, running another Way; for in a Word, they ran
every Way like Sportfien beating;for their Game.
T HE poor Men were now in great Perplexity, whether
they fihould fand and keep their Poture, or fly:  ut after a very ftort Debate with themfelves, they confider'd,
that if the Savages rang'd the Country 'tlius befbe Help
came, they might perhaps find out their Retreat in the
Woods, and then all would be loft; of they reiolv'd to
Rtand them there; and if there were too many to deal with,
then they would get up to the Top of the Tree, from
whence they doubted not to defend themselves, Fireexceptid, as long as their Ammunition lafled, tho' all th  Savages that were landed, which was near fifty, were toattack them..;    HAVI NG revi'd4 upon this, they next conider'd, whether they fhouldtfirlat the fir tiwo, or wait for the three,
Yand fo take middle Party, by whih the two and the five
tat follow'd would be feparated; at length they rflov'd.  ~ *.  *.  '  i..  t



to let the two firfi pats by, unlefs they Mhould fpy them
in the Tree, and come to attack them. The two firftSavages alfo confirm'd them in this Refolution, by turning a little from them towards another Part of the Wood;
but the three, and the five after them, came forwards direftly to the Tree, as if they had known the Englilmew
were there.
S EEING them come Co ftrait towards them, they ret
folv'd to take them in a Line, as they came; and as they
refolv'd to fire but one at a Time, perhaps the firft Shot
might hit them all three; to which Purpofe, the Mah
Who was to fire, put three or four Bulets into his Piece
and having a fair Loop-hole, as it were, from a broken
Hole in the Tree, he took a fure Aim, without being
feen, waiting till they were within about thirty Yards o
the Tree, Co that he could not mifs.
W H   L E they were thus waiting, and the Savage&amp;
came on, they plainly faw, that one of the three was the
Run-away Savage that had efcap'd from them, and they
both knew him diftin&amp;ly, and refolv'd, that if poffible, he
flhould not efcape, tho' they lhould both fire; io the other
flood ready with his Piece, that if he did not drop at the
firft Shot, he fhould be fure to have a fecond.
B u T the firit was too good a Markfman to mifs his
Aim; for as the Savages kept near one another, a little behind in a Line; in a Word, he fir'd, and hit two of 'em
dire&amp;ly: The foremoft was kill'd outright, being fhot it
the Head: The fecond, which was the run-away Indiarn
was fhot thro' the Body, and fell, but was not quite
dead: And the third had a little Scratch in the Shoulder,
perhaps by the fame Ball that went thro' the Body of the
fecond, and being dreadfully frighted, tho' not much hurt,
fat down upon the Ground, skreaming and yelling in a
hideous manner.
T HE five that were behind, more frighted with the
Noife, than fenfible of the Danger, flood fill at firfi; for
the Woods made the Sound a Thoufand Times bigger
than it really was; the Eccho's rattling from one side to
another, and the Fowls rfiing from if Parts, skreaming,
and making, every Sort, a everal kind of Noife, according
t9 their Kind, juft as it was when I fir'd the firft Gun,
D.*i



that perhaps was ever [hot off in that Place fince it was
an Ifand.
H ow E v E R, all being filent again, and they not knowing what the Matter was, came on unconcern'd, till they
came to the Place where their Companions lay in a Condition mifeiable enough: And here the poor ignorant Creatures, not fenfible that they were within Reach of the
fame Mifchief, flood all of a Huddle over the wounded
Man, talking, and, as may be fuppos'd, enquiring of him
how he came to be hurt; and who, 'tis very rational to
believe, told them, that a Flaih of Fire firft, and immediately after that, Thunder from their Gods, had kill'd
thofe two, and wounded him: This I fay, is rational;
for nothing is more certain than that, as they faw no Man
near them, fo they had never heard a Gun in all their Lives,
or fo much as heard of a Gun; neither knew they any thing
of killing or wounding, at a Diftance, with Fire and Buglets; if they had, one might reafonably believe, they would
not have flood fo unconcern'd, in viewing the Fate of
their Fellows, without fome Apprehenlion of their own.
O u R two Men, tho' as they confefs'd to me, it grieved
'em to be cblig'd to kill fo many poor Creatures, who, at the
fame Time, had no Notion of their Danger; yet having
them all thus in their Power, and the firil having loaded
his Piece again; refolved to let fly both together among
theme and fingling out, by Agreement, which to aim
at, they fhot together, and kill'd or very much wounded
four of them; the fifth, frighted even to Death, though
not hurt, fell with the reft; fo that our Men feeing them
all fall together, thought they had kill'd them all.
T I E Belief that the Savages were all kill'd, made our
two Men come boldly out from    the Tree before they
had charg'd their Guns again, which was a wrong Step;
and they were under fome $,urprize when they came to the
Place, and found no lefs than four of the Men alive, and
of them two very little hurt, and one not at all: This
oblig'd them to fall upon them with the Stocks of their
Muskets; and firft they made fure of the run-away Savage, that had been the Caufe of all the Mifchief, and
of another that was hurt in his Knee, and put them out
of their Pain then the Man that was not hurt at all,
ame and kneel'd down to them, with -his two Hands
held



held up, and madepiteous Moan to them by Geflures and
Signs, for his Life; but could not*fay one Word to them
that they could underfland.
HOWEVER, they fign'd to him to fit down at the
Foot of a Tree thereby; and one of the Englij.mez,  with
a-Piece of Rope Twine which he had, by great Chance,
in his Pocket, ty'd his two Feet faft together, and his
two Hands behind him, and there they left him; and,
with what Speed they could, made after the other two,
which were gone before; fearing they, or any more of
them, fiould fnd the Way to their cover'd Place in the
Woods, where their Wives, and the few Goods they had
left, lay: They came once in Sight of the two   len,
but it was a great Diftance; however, they had the Satisfadtion to fee them crofs over a Valley towards the Sea,
the quite contrary Way from that which led to their Retreat, which they were afraid of; and being fatisfy'd with
that, they went back to the Tree, where they left their
Prifoner, who, as they fuppos'd, was deliver'd by his
Comrades; for he was gone, and the two Pieces of Rope
Yarn, with which they had bound him, lay juft at the
Foot of the Tree.
T H E Y were now in as great a Concern as before, not
knowing* what Courfe to take, or how near the Enemy
might be, or in what Numbers; fo they refolv'd to go
away to the Place where their Wives were, to fee if all
was well there, and to make them eafy, who were in
Fright enough to be fure; for tho' the Savages were their
own Country Folk, yet they were moit terribly aftaid
of them, and perhaps the more, for the Knowledge they
had of them,
WHE N they come there, they found the Savages had
been in the Wood, and very near that Place, but had not
found it; for it was indeed inacceffible, by the Trees
handing fo thick, as before, unlefs the Perfons feeking it
had been direced by thofe that knew it, which thefe did
not; they found therefore every Thing very fife, only
the Women in a terrible fright: While they were here,
they had the Comfort of feven of the Spaniards comeing to
their Affifrance; the other ten, with their Servants, and
old Friday, I mean Friday's Father were gone in a Body
to defend their Bower, and the Corn, and Cattle that was
D 3                    kept



kept there, in Cafe the Savages fhould have rov'd over b
that Side of the Country, but they did not fpread fo far:
With the feven Spaniards came one of the Savages, who,
as I faid, were their Prifoners formerly; and with them
alfo came the Savage, who the Englifhmen had left bound
Hand and Foot at the Tree; for it feems they came that
Way, faw the Slaughter of the feven Men, and unbound
the eighth, and brought him along with them; where
however, they were oblig'd to bind him again, as they
had the two others, who were left whent the third run
away.
THE Prifoners began now to be a Burthen to them;
and they were fo afraid of their efcaping, that they
thought they were under an abfolute Necefity to kill
them, for their own Prefervation: However, the Spatiard Governour would not content to it, but order'd
that they fhould be fent out of the Way, to myold Cave
in the Valley, and be kept there with two Spaniards to
guard them, and give them Food, which was done; and
they were bound there Hand and Foot for that Night.
WHEN the Spaniards came, the two Englihmen;were
fo encouragd, that they could not fatisfy themfelves to
flay any longer there; but taking five of the Spaniards,
and themfelves, with four Muskets and a Piftol among
them, and two ftout Quarter-Starves, away they went in
qucef of the Savages; And firft they came to the Tree
where the Men lay that had been kill'd; but it was eafy to
ee, thatifome more of the Savages had been there; for they
had attempted to carry their dead Men away, and had
dragg d two of them a good Way, but had given it over:
From thence they advanc'd to the firft riing Ground,
where they had flood, and feen their Camp deftroyed,
and where they had the Mortification ftill to fee fome of the
Smoak; but neither could they here feeany of the Savages:
They then refolv',d, tho' with all poffible Caution, to go
forward towards their ruin'd Plantation; But a little before'
they came thither, coming in Sight of the Sea Shore,
they faw plainly the Savages all embraking again in their
Canoes, in order to be gone.
TH E Y feem d forry at firft that there was no Way to.come at them, to give them a parting Blow: But upon
he whole, w     ere vey well ftisfy'd to be rid of them.
TuH



THE poor Engllften being now twice ruin'd, and al
their Improvements deftroy'd, the reft all agreed to'come
and help them rebuild, and to aflift them  with needful
Supplies. Their three Countrymen, who were not yet
noted for having the leaft Inclination to do any Good, yet
as foon as they heard of it (for they living remote Eafiward, knew   nothing of the Matter 'till all was over)
came and offer'd their Help land Affiftance, and did very
friendly work for feveral Days, to reftore their Habitation, and make Neceffaries for them: and thus, in a little
Time, they were fet upon their Legs again.
A B o u T two Days after this, tley had the farther Satisfaction of feeing three of the Savages Canoes come
driving on Shore, and at fome Diftance fiom    them,
two drown'd Men; by which they had reafon to believe,
that they had met with a Storm at Sea, and had overfet
fome of them; for it had blown very hard the very Night
after they went off.
H o w E v E R, as fome might mifcarry, fo on the other
Hand, enough of them efcap'd to inform the reft, as well
of what they had done, as of wiat happen'd to them;
and to whet them on to another Enterprize of thefame Na-t
ture, which they, it feems, refolv'd to, attempt, with fufficient Force to carry all before them, for except what the
firfi Man had told them of Inhabitants, they could fay little to it of their own Knowledge; for they never faw
one Man, and the Fellow being kili'd that had affirm'd it,
they had no other Witnefs to confirm it to them.
I T was five or fix Months after this, before they heard
any more of the Savages; in which Time our Men were
in Hopes they had either forgot their former bad Luck,
or given over the Hopes of  etter; when on a fudden
they were invaded with a moft formidable Fleet, of no
lefs than eight and twenty Canoes full of Savages, arm'd
with Bows and Arrows, great Clubs, wooden Swords, and
fuch like Engines of War; and they brought fuch Numbers with them, that, in fhort, it put all our People into
the utmoft Confternation.
As they came on Shore in the Evening, and at the
Eafler-moft Side of the Ifland, our Men had that Night
to confult and confider what to do; and, in the firfi P ace,
knowing that their being entirely conceal'd, was their onr
D 4                       ly



ly Safety before and would much more be fo now, whilF
the Number of their Enemies was fo great, they therefore
refolv'd firft of all to take down the Huts which were
built for the two EnglifhJmen, and drive away their Goats
to the old Cave; becaufe they fuppofed the Savages would
go diredly thither, as foon as it was Day, to play the old
Gam'e over again, though they did not now land within
two Leagues of it.
I N the next Place, they drove away all the Flock of
Goats they had at the old Bo-wer, as I call'd it, which
Lelong'd to the Spanardsi and, in ihort, left as little Appeanance of Inhabitants any where as was poffible, and
the next Morning early they pofted themfelves with all
their Force at the Plantation of the two Men, waitin'
for their coming: As they guefsd, fo it happen 'd thele
new Invaders leaving their -Canoes at the Eaft End of the
Ifland, came ranging along the Shore dire&amp;cly towv.-s the
Place, to the Number of two hundred and fifty, as near as
our Men could judge. Our Army was but finall indeedbut that which was worfe, they had not Arms for aI

To their Slaves they did not give either Musket or Fizee, but they had every one a Halberd, or a long Stafflike
a Quarter-Staff, with a great Spike of Iron faften'd intoteach
End of it, and by his Side a Hatchet; alfo every one of
our Men had Hatchets: Tw9 of the Women could not
be prevail'd upon, but they would come into the Fight,
and they had Bows and Arrows, which the Spaniards had
taken from the Savages, when the firft Adtion happen'd,
which I have fpoken of, where the Indians fought with
one another, and the Women had Hatchets too.
T HE Spaniard Governour, who I have defcrib'd fo often, commanded the whole; and William Atkins, who,
tho' a dreadful Fellow for Wickednefs, was a moft daring bold Fellow, commanded under him. The Savages
came forward like Lyons, and our Men, which was the
worft of their Fate, had no Advantage in their Situation;
only that Will. Atkins, who now prov'd a moft ufeful
Fellow, with fix Men, was planted juft behind a fmall
Thicket of Bufhes, as an advanc'd Guard, with Orders to
let the firft of them pafs by, and then fire into the middle of them; and, as foon as he had fir'd, to make his Retreat as nimbly as he could round a Part of the Wood, and
fo come in behind the Spa.iards where they flood, havinga Thicket of Trees all before them.
W H E N the Savages came on, they run ffraggling about
every way in Heaps, out of all manner of Ordcer, and 1Wiliam Atkins let about fifty of them pafs by him, then feeing the reft comb in a very thick Throng, he orders three
ofhis Men to fire, having loaded their Mufquets with fix
or feven Bullets a-piece, about as big as large Pilol Bullets..
How many they kill'd or wounded, they knew  not, but
the Confternation and Surprise was inexpreffible among
the Savages; they were flightcd to the lat Degree, to hear
fuch a dreadful Noife, and ice their Men kill'd, and others
hurt, but fee no Body that did it; when in the middle of
their Fright, William  tk,:ns, and his other three, let lyagain among the thickeft of them  and in lefs than a Minute the firft three, being loaded again, gave them a third
Volley.
HA D William atkins and his Men retir'd immediately,
as foon as they had fir'd, as they were order'd to do: or
bad the reit of the Body been at Hand to have pour'd in
)D:                   their



their Shot continualy, the Savages had been effefualy
routed; for the Terror that was among them, came principally from this, (viz.) That they were kill'd by the Gods
with Thunder and Lightning, and could fee no Body that
hurt them; but William  Atkins ftaying to load again, difcover'd the Cheat: Some of the Savages who were at a
Diftance, fpying them, came upon them behind, and tho'
Atkins and his Men fir'd at them alfo, two or three times,
and kil'd above twenty, retiring as faft as they could, yet
they wounded Atkins himfelf, and kill'd one of his Fellow Englihjmen with their Arrows, as they did afterwards
one spaniard, and one of the Indian Slaves who came with
the Women; this Slave was a moft gallant Fellow, and
fought moft defperately, killing five of them  with his
own Hand, having no Weapon, but one of the arm'd
Staves and a Hatchet.
Our Men being thus hard laid at, Atkins wounded, and
two other Men killd, retreated to a riing Ground in the
Wood; and the Spaniards, after firing three Vollies upon
them retreated alfo; for their Number was fo great, and
they wer fo defperate, that tho' above fifty of them were
killd, and more than fo many wounded, yet they came
on in the Teeth of our Men, fearlefs of Danger, and fhot
their Arrows like a Cloud; and it was obferv'd, that their
wounded Men, who were not quite difabled, were made
-utragious by their Wounds, and fought like Madmen.
W HE N our Men retreated, they left the spaniard and
the Englifjman that were kill'd behind them; and the Savages, when they came up to them, kill'd them over again
in a wretched manner, breaking their Arms, Legs and Heads,:with their Clubs and wooden Swords, like true Savages:
But finding our Men were gone, they did not feem to
purfue them, but drew themfelves up in a kind of a Ring,
which is, it feems, their Cuifom, and fhouted twice in
Token of their Vi&amp;ory: After which, they had the Mortification to ee feveral of their wounded Men fall, dying,,.with thenere Lofs of Blood.
The s$tmard Governour having drawn his little Body
up together upon a rifing Giound, Atkins, tho' he was
woundd, would have had him marchad and charg'd them
agin altogether at once: But the Sp iards replyd, SeigKzW.tkiy, ou fee how their wounded Men fight, let 'ein
akre



alone till Morning; all thefe wounded Men will be {liff and
fore with their Wounds, and faint with the Lofs of Blood;
iand So we fhall have the fewer to engage.
T HE Advice was good: But Will. Atkins reply'd merrily, That's true, Seignior, and fo fiall I too; and that's
the Reafon I would go on while I am    warm.    Well,
Seignior Atkins, fays tile Spaniards, you have behav'd gallantly, and done your Part; we will fight for you, if you
cannot come on, but I think it belt to flay 'till.Morning
fo they waited.
B UT as it was a clear Moon-light Night, and they
found the Savages in great Diforder about their dead and
wounded Men, and a great Hurry and Noife among them
where they lay, they afterwards refolv'd to fall upon them
in the Night, efpecially if they could come to give them
but one Volley before they were difcover'd: This they
had a fair Opportunity to do, for one of the two Eng?
lifhmen, in whofe Quarter it was where the Fight began,
led them round between the Woods, and the Sea-iide,VeIward, and then turning fl;oit South, they came fo near where
the thickefl of thenm lay, that before they were feen or
heard, eight of them fir'd in among them, and did dreadful Execution upon them   in half a Mintte mo e, eight
others fir'd after them, pouring in their fmall Shot in fich
a Quantity, that abundance were kiil'd and wounded; and
all this while they were not able to fee who hurt them,
or which Way to fly.
T H E Spaniards charg'd again with the utmolf Expedition, and then divided themfelves into three Bodies, and
refolv'd to fall in among them altogether: They had in
each Body eight Peifons, that is to lay,,  w, hereof were
2a Men, and the 2 Women, who, by the Way, fought dcfperately.
T HE Y divided the Fire-Arms equally in each Party,
and fo of the Halberds and Staves: They would lave hdt
the Women keep back, but they faid they were refoiv'd
to die with their Husbands. Having thus form'd their little Army, they march'd out from among the Trees, and
came up to the Teeth of the     enemy, fhouting and
hollowing as loud as they could; th Savages flood altogether, but were in the utmofi Confufion, hearing the Noife
of our Men fhouting from three Quarters together; thy
would



*ould have fought if they had feen us: And as foon as vWr
came near enough to be feen, rome Arrows were fhot;
and, poor old. Fridy- was wounded, tho' not dangeroufly:
But our Men gave them   no Time - but running up to
them, fir' among them three Ways, and then fell in with
the Bat-ends of their Muskets, their Swords, arm'd Staves,
and' Hatchets; andlaid about them fowell, that, in a Word
Ahey fet up a difinal' Skreaming and' Howling, flying to,
iiv' their Lives. which way foever they could.

f.on the, Sea-vard; fo that it was impoifible for them to
go offj, nay; the Stormo continuing- alr Night, when the
'tde ame up, their Canoes were moft of them driven by
'the Surge of the Sea fo high upon the Shote, that it requir'd infinite Toil to get them  off: and fcme of them
were: even dafh'd to Pieces againif the Beach, or againft
one another.
o u R- Men, tlho glad of 'their Vitory, yet got little
R'eft that Night, - but having' reffefh'd. themf!lves as w  l
as they could, they refolv'd to march to- that Part of the
Ifand where- the Savages -were fled, and fee what Pofiure
they were itn. This necefiarily led them over the Place
whiere the Fight- had been, and where they found feveral
of the poor Creatures notquite dead, and yet pail recovering-Life  a, Sight diigreeable enough to generous Minds;
for a truly great Man, tho' oblig'd by the Law of Battle to deflroy his Enemy, takes no Delight in his MiH o w  vER, there was no need to- give any Orders
in this Cafe  for their own Savages, who were their
Servants, difpatchd thofe- poor Creatures with- their
$atchets.
A T length they came iii View of the Place where the
oQre mferable Remains of the Savages Army lay,, where
* '           thbie



tliere appear'd about an hundred fRill; their Pollure was g7
nerally fitting upon the Ground, with their Knees up to-r a...
wards their Mouth, and the Head put between the two
Hands, leaning down upon the Knees.
W H EN our Men came within two Musket-Shot of
them, the Spaniard Governonr order'd two Muskets to be
fir'd without Ball, to alarm them; this he did, that by their
Countenance he might know what to expe&amp;, viz. Whether they were fill in Heart to fight, or were fo heartily
beaten, as to be difpirited and difcourag'd, and fohe might
manage accordingly.
T H s Stratageml took; for, as foon as the Savages heard
the firft Gun, and faw the Flafh of the fecond, they ilatted
up upon their Feet in the greateft Contfernation imaginable; and as our Men advanc'd fwiftly towards them, they
all ran skreaming and yawling away, with a kind of a
howling. Noifi, which our Men did not underftand, and
had never heard Leforei and thus they ran up the Hills in â
to the Country.
A T firft, our Men had much rather the Weather had
been calm, and they had all gone away to Sea: But they
did not then confider, that this might probably have been
the Occafion of their coming again in flch Multitudes, as
not to be refifted; or, at Icaff, to come ib many, and fboften, as would quite defolate the Ifland, and ftlarve them: *
Will. Atkins therefore, who, notwithftnding his Wound,
kept always with them, prov'd the beof Counfllor in this
Cafe: His Advice was, to take the Advantage that offer'd,
and clap in between them  and their Boats,.and fo defrive
them of the Capacity of ever returning any more to plague
the Ifland.
T-I F. Y confulted long about this, and tome were againft
it, for fear of making the Wretches fly to the Woods, and
live there dcfperate  ' and fo they fhould have their to hunt
like wild Beats, be afraid to flir out about their Bufinefs,
and have their Plantations continually ifed, all their tame
' Goats defaroy'd, and, in Ihort, be rcduc'd to a Life of continual Diflrefs.
Will. Atkins told'them, they had better have to do with
an hundred Men, than with an hundred Nations: That as
tyeZ muft: deiroy their Boats, fo they mult dcftroy the
Men,



Men, or be all of them deftroy'd themfelves.  In a Word,
he fhew'd them the Necefitty of it fo plainly, that they all
came into it;5 fo they Went to work immediately with
the Boats, and getting 'Lome dry Wood together from a
dead Tree, they try'd to fet Lome of them on fire, but they
were fo wet, that they would not burn: however, the Fire
fo burn'd the upper Part, that it foon made them unfit for
fwimming in the Sea as Boats. When the Indians law
what they were about, fome of them came running out
of the Woods, and coming as near as they could to our
Men, kneel'd down and cry d, Oa, Oa, Waramokoa, and
fome other Words of their Language, which none of the
others underflood any thing of; but as they made pitiful
Geftures, and ftrange Noifes, it was eafy to underifand,
they begg'd to have their Boats fpar'd, and that they would
be gone, and never come there again.
B  T our Men were now fatisfied, that they had no Way
to preferve themselves, or to five their Colony, but elfcctually to prevent any of thefe People from ever going home
again; depending upon this, that if ever fo fnuch as one of
them got back into their Country to tell the Story, the
Colony was undone; fi that letting them know that they
fhould not have any Mercy, they fell to work with their
Canoes, and deftroy'd them every one, that the Storm had
not deftroy'd before; at the Sight of which, the Savages
rais'd a hedious Cry in the Woods, which our People heard
plain enough; after which they ran about the Ifand like
diftra&amp;ed Men fo that, in a Word, our Men did not read
ly know at firit what to do with them.
No R did the Spaniards, with all tieir Prudence, conf
der, that while they made thofe People thus defperate,
they ought to have kept good Guard at the fame Time
upon their Plantations; for tho' it is true, they had driven
away their Cattle, and the Indians did not find out their
main Retreat, I mean my old Caftle at the Hill, nor the
Cave in the Valley, yet they found out my Plantation at the
Bower,and pull'd it all to Pieces, and all the Fences and Planting
about it trode all the Corn under Foot; tore up the Vincs
and Grapes, being jut then almoft ripe, and did our Men an
ineftimanble Damage, tho to themfelves not one Farthing'sworth of Service,



THO' our Men were able to fight them upon al Oo0
cafions, yet they were in no Condition to purfue them, or
hunt them up and down; for as they were too nimble of
Foot for our Men, when they found them fingle, fo our
Men durft not go about fingle, for fear of being furrounded
with their Numbers: The beft was, they had no Weapons,
for tho' they had Bows, they had no Arrows left, nor any
Materials to make any, nor had they any edg'd Tool or
Weapon among them.
TH E Extremity and Diftrefs they were reduc'd to was
great, and indeed deplorable  but at the fame Time, our
Men were alfo brought to very bad Circumflances by
them; for tho' their Retreats were preferved, yet their Provifion was deftroyed, and their Harveft fpoiled, and what
to do, or which Way to turn themfelves, they knew not:
The only Refuge they had now, was the Stock of Cattle
they had in the Valley by the Cave, and fome little Cotn
which grew there: The three Englifhmen, Wiiliam Atkins and his Comiades, were now   reduc'd to two,
one of them being kill d by an Arrow which ftruck him
on the Side of his Head, juft under the Temple, fo that
he never fpoke more; and it wvas very remarkable, that
this was the fame barbarous Fellow who cut the poor Savage Slave with his Hatchet, and who afterwards intended.to have murther'd the Spaniards.
I 1, OK' D upon their Cafe to have been worfe at this
Time, than mine was at any Time, after I firft difcover'd
the Grains of, Barley and Rice, and got into the Method
of planting and railing my Corm, and my tame Cattle;
for now they had, as I may fay, a hundred Wolves upon
the Ifland, which would devour every Thing they could
come at, yet could very hardly be come at themfelves.
THE firft Thing thcy concluded, when they faw what
their Circum tances were, was, that they would, if pofE.
ble, drive them up to the faether Part of the Ifland, South.
Ea t, that if any more Savages came on Shore, they might
not find one another: Then, that they would daily hunt
and harafs them, and kill as many of them as they could
come at, till they had reduc'd their Number; and if they
could at laft tame them  and bring them to any Thing,
they would give them Corn, and teach them how to plant
andlive upon their daily Labour.



IN order to this, they fo follow'd them, andfo terrify'
them with their Guns, that in a few Days, if any of them
fired a Gun at an Indian, if he did not hit him, yet he
would fall down for Fear; and fo dreadfully frighted they
were, that they kept out of Sight farther and farther, till
at laft our Men following them, and every Day almoft
killing and wounding fonme of them, they kept up in the
Woods and hollow Places fo much, that it reduc'd them to
the utmoft Mifery for want of Food  and many were afterwards found dead in the VWoods, without any Hurt, but
meerly ftarved to Death.
W HEN our Men found this, it made their Hearts relent, and Pity mov'd them; efpecially the Spaniard Governour, who was the moft Gentleman-like generous-minded
Man that ever I met with in my Life; and he propos'd, if
poffibie, to take one of them alive, and bring him to underfland what they meant, fo far as to be able to aA a,-:
Intert reter, and to go among them, and fee if they might be
brought to ome Conditions, that might be depended upon, to fave their Li es, and to do us no Spoil.
I r wras fonie  e w ble  fore any of them could be taken;
but being weak and h.1lf flarv'd, one of them was at lafl
furprized and ndmade a Pliibner; he was fullen at firif, andt
Wl;uld nei-her eat nor drink, but finding himfelf kindly
-fed, and V1&amp;ti1al given hnim, and noViolence offer'd him,
-he at!ift gew tGi'a't, atn came to himfelf.
T i E Y brought old Fridad to him, who talked often
with him, and told him how kind the other would be to
them alJ: that they would not only five their Lives, but
'would g!'e zhecm a Par of the Ifland to live in, provided
they would give Satisfa&amp;ion, that they  woud keep
in their own Bounds, and not come beyond them, to injure 01 prejudice others; and that they fhould have Corn
given lthe, to plant and make it grow for their Bread,
and ibme fBre.d given them for their prefent Subfiiance -
'and old Friday bad the Fellow go and talk with the reft of
his Countrymen, and See what they fid to it, alluring
them, that if they did not agree immediately they Ihould
Ee all deft oy'd.
TI F. poor W~retclhe; tlhrouhly hun blcd, and reduc'd
in Number to aboutt thi:ty fervcn, cos'd with the Propofal
at the firft Offer, and beg'd to have. fme Food given
thiemi



them; upon which, twelve spaniards, and two EnglhFnme#
well arm'd, and three Indian Slaves, and old Friday, marched to the Place where they werei the three Indian Slaves
carried themp  a large Quantity of Bread, and fome Rice
boiled up to Cakes, and dry'd in the Sun, and three live
Goats and they were ordered to go to the Side of a Hill
where they fat down, eat the Provifions, very thankfully,
and were the mofi faithful Fellows to their Words that
could be thought of; for except when they camne to beg
ViAuals and Diredtions, they never came out of their
Bounds; and there they lived when I came to the Ifland,
and I went to fee them.
T   EY had taught them both to plant Corn, make
Bread, breed tame Goats, and milk them; they wanted no
thing but Wives, and they foon would have been a Nation: They were confined to a Neck of Land, furrounded with high Rocks behind them, and lying plain towards
the Sea before them, on the South-Eaft Corner of the
Ifland: They had Land enough, and it was very good and
fruitful, for they had a Piece of.and about a Mile and
half broad, three or four Mile in Length.
O U R Men taught them to make wooden Spades, fuch
ts I made for my felf, and gave them among them twelve
Hatchets and three or four Knves  and there they liv'd
the moit fubjee&amp;ed innocent Creatures, that ever were
heard of.
A F T ER this, the Colony enjoy'd a perfe&amp; Tranquility
with refped to the Savages, till I came to revifit them,
which was in about two Years: Not, but that now and
then, fome Canoes of Savages came on Shore for their triumphal unnatural Feafls,but as they were of feveral Nations, and perhaps had never heard of thofe that came before, or the Reafon of it, they did not make any Search
or Enquiry after their Countrymen; and if they had,
it would have been very hard' for them to have found
them out.
TH u, I think, I have given a full Account of all that
happen'd to them, to my Return, at leaft, that was worth
Notice. The Indians or Savages were wonderfully civii:z'd by them, and they frequently went among them, but
forbid on Pain of Death, any one of the Indians comingto
theim,



)go
them, becaufe they would not have their Settlement betray'd again.
O N E Thing was very remarkable, vi~z. that they taught
the Savages to make Wicker-work, or Baskets; but they
Coon out-did their Malters; for they made abundance of
moft ingenious Things in Wicker-work; patticularly, all
Sorts of Baskets, Sieves, Bird-Cages, Cup-boards, &amp;c. as
alfo Chairs to fit on, Stools, Beds, Couches, and abundance
of other Things, being very ingenious at fuch Work, when
they were once put in the Way of it.
M Y coming was a particular Relief to thefe People, becaufe we furnifi'd them with Knives, Sciffars, Spades, Shovels, Pickaxes, and all Things of that Kind which they
could want.
W  T H the Help of thefe Tools they were fo veryhandy, that they came at laft to build up their Huts, or Houfes, very handfomely  raddling or working it up like Basket-work all the Way round, which was a veiy extraordinary Piece of Ingenuity, and look'd very odd, but was an
exceeding good Fence, as well againlf Heat, as againft ll
Sorts of Vermine; and our Men were fo takcen with it,
that they got the wild Savages to come and do the like for
them; i othat when I came to fee the two Englifinen's
Colonies, they look'd, at a Diflance, as if they liv d all like
Bees, in a Hive; and as for W]l. Jtkins, who was nowbecome a very induftrious, neceffary and fober.Fllow, he
had made himfelf fich a Tent of Basket-work, as I believe was never feen; it was 126 Paces round in the out* ide, as I meafur'd by my Steps; the Walls were as clofe
work'd as a Basket in Pannels, or Squares of 3  in Number, and very ftrong, ftanding about feven Foot high; in
the middle was another not above 22 Paces round, but
built fironger, being Eight-fquare in its Form, and in the
eight Comers flood eight very ftlong Pofts, round the top
of which he laid ftorig Pieces pinn'd together with wooden Pins, from which he raifed a Pirarmd for the Roof of'
eight Rafters, very handfome, I affure you, and join'd together very well, tho' he had no Nails, and only a few
Iron-Spikes, which he had made himfelf too, out of the
old Iron that I had left there; and indeed thisFellow lew'd
bundance of Igenuietyn '  fevreral T   hin,  w hic   he had
iwo Knowlede of; he made himfelf a Torge, with a Pair
eSa



I Tf wooden Bellows to blow the Fire; he made himfelf
Charcoal for his Work, and he form'd out of one of the
Iron-Crows, a middling good Anvil to hammer upon; in
this Manner he made many Things, but efpecially Hooks,
Staples and Spikes, Bolts and Hinges: But to return to the
Houfe; after he had pitch'd the Roof of his innermoft
Tent, he work'd it up between the Rafters with Basketwork, fo firm, and thatch'd that over again fo ingenioufly
with Rice-ftraw, and over that a large Leaf of a Tree, which
cover'd the Top, that his Houfe was as dry as if it had been
til'd or flated. Indeed he own'd that the Savages made the
Basket-work for him.
T H E outer Circuit was cover'd, as a Lean-too, allround
this inner Apartment, and long Rafters lay from the two
and thirty Angles to the top Pofts of the inner Houfe, being about twenty Foot diflant  fo that there was a Space
like a Walk, within the outer Wicker-wall, and without
the inner, near twenty Foot wide.
T H E inner Place he partition'd off with the fame Wicker-work, but much fairer, and divided it into fix Apartments, fo that he had fix Rooms on a Floor; and out of evel
ry one of thefe there was a Door, firft into the Entry or
Coming into the main Tent, and another Door into the
Space or Walk that was round it; fo that Walk was ahit
divided into fix equal Parts, which ferv'd not only for Re,
treat, but to fore up any Neceffaries which the Family had
occafon for. Thefe fix Spaces not taking up the whole
Circumference, what other Apartments the outer Circle
had, were thus ordered: As foon you were in at the Door
of the outer Circle, you had a ifort Paflage ftrait before
you to the Door of the inner Houfe, but on either Side
was a Wicker-Partition, and a I)or in it, by which you
went, firif, into a large Room or Store-houfe, twenty Foot
wide, and about thirty Foot long, and thro' that 'into another not quite fo long; fo that in the outer Circle was
ten handfome Rooms, fix of which were only to be come
at thro' the Apartments of the inner Tent, and ferv d as
Clo4ets or retired Rooms to the refpetive Chambers of
the inner Circle; and four large Ware-houfes or Barns, or
what you pleafe to call them, which went in thro' one another, two on either Hand of the Paffage, that led thro'the
outer Door to the inner Tent.
SVoc



S u c H a Piece of Basket-work, I believe,, was- never fe
in the World; nor a Houfe, or Tent, fo neatly contrived,
much lefs, fo built: In this great Bee-hive liv'd the three
Families, that is to fay, Will. Atkins and-his Companion,
the third was kill'd, but his Wife remain'd with three
Children; for fhe was, it feems, big with Child when he
dy'd, and the other two were not at all backward to give
the Widow her full Share of every Thing, I mean, as to
their Corn, Milk, Grapes, &amp;c. and when they kill'd a Kid,
or found a Turtle. on the Shore; fo that they all liv'd well
enough, tho' it was true, they were not fo induftrious as
other two, as has been obferv'd already.
O N E Thing, however, cannot be omitted, viz. That as
for Religion, I don't knowr that there was any Thing of
that kind among them; they pretty often indeed put one
another in Mind that there was a God, by the very common Method of Seamen, viz. Swearing by his Name:
Nor were theirpoor ignorant Savage Wives much the better
for having been marry'd torhriftians, as we mullr call them
for as they knew very little of God themfelves, fo they were
utterly uncapable of entring into any Difcourie with their
Wives about a God, oato talk any thing to them cdncerning Religion.
T THE utmoft of 'all the Improvement which I can fay
t  Wives had made for them, was, tht they had taught
-nem to fpeak Erih pretty well, and all the Children they
had, which was near 2o in all, were taught to fpeak Erng
1ifh too, from their firft learning to fipeak, tho' they atfirft
fpoke it in a very broken Manner, like their Mothers.
There were none of thefe Children above fix Years old
when I came thither, for it was not much above feven
Years that they had fetch'd thefe five Savage Ladies over,
but they had all been pretty fruitful, for they had all Children, more or les: I think the Cook's Mate's Wife was
big of her fixth Child; and the Mothers were all a good
Sort of well-govern'd, quiet, laborious Women, modeftand
decent, helpiul to one another, mighty obfervant and fubje&amp;t to their Mafters, I cannot call them Husbands; and
wanted nothing but to be well inflru&amp;ted in the. Chriflian
Religion, and to be legally marry'd both which werehappily brought about afterwards by my Means, or, at leaft,
by the Conftquence of my coming among them.
HAvIN&amp;



H A VI N G thus given an Account of the Colony in gneral, and pretty much of my five Runagate Englihmen, I
mufl fay ibmething of the Spaniards, who were the main
Body of the Family  and in whole Story there are fome
Inoidents alfo remarkable enough.
I H A D a great many Difcourfes with them about their
Circumftances, when they were among theSavages: They
told me readily, that they had no Initances to give of their
Application or Ingenuity in that Country; that they were
a poor miserable dejeed Handful of People; that if Means
had been put into their Hands, they had yet fo abandon'd
themfelves to Defpair, and fo funk under the Weight of
their Misfortunes, that they thought of nothing but Starving: One of them, a grave and very fenfible Man, told
me, he was convinc'd they were in the wrong; that it
was not the Part of wife Men, to give up themfelves to
their Mifery, but always to take hold of the Helps which
Reafon offerd, as well for prefent Support, as for future
Deliverance: He told me, that Grief was the moft fenfelefs
infignificant Paflion in the World; for that it regarded only
Things paft, which were generally impoffible to be recall'd,
or to be remedy'd, but had no View to Things to come,
and had no Share in any Thing that look'd like Deliverance,
but rather added to the Afflition, than propofed a Remedy: And upon this, he repeated a Spanijh Proverb; which
though I cannot repeat in juft the fime Words that he
fpoke it, yet I remember I made it into an Engij/h Proverb of my own, thus:
In Trouble to be troubl'd,
Is to have yor Trouble doubl'd.
H E ran on then, in Remarks upon all the little Improve.
ments I had made in my Solitude  my unweary'd Application, as he call'd it, and how  I had made a Condition,
wvhich in its Circumfiances, was at firft, much worfe than
theirs, a thoufand Times more happy than theirs was, even
now, when they were all together: He told me, it was
remarkable, that Englif? men had a greater Prefinceof Mind
in their Diffrefs, than any People that ever he met withi
that their unhappy Nation, and the  ortuguefe, were the
wQorf



worft Men in the World to ftruggle with Misfortunes; for
that their firft Step in Dangers, after common Efforts are
over, was always to defpair, lie down under it, and die,
without roufing their Thoughts up to proper Remedies
for Efcape.
I told him, their Cafe and mine differ'dexceedingly, that
they were call upon the Shore without Neceffaries, without Supply of Food, or of prefent Suflenance, 'till they
could provide: That it is true, I had this Difadvantage
and Dilcomfort, that I was alone; but then the Supplies I
had providentially thrown into my Hands, by the unexpeeted driving of the Ship on Shore, was fuch a Help as
would have encourag'd any Creature in the World to have
apply'd himfelf as I have done: Seignior, fays the Spaniard,
had we poor Spaniards been in your Cafe, we fhould never have gotten half thofe Things out of the Ship as
you did: Nay fays he, we flould never have found Means
to have gotten a Raft to carry them, or to have gotten a
Raft on Shore without Boat or Sail and how much lefs
ihould we have done, faid he, if any of us had been alone?
Well, I defir'd him to abate his Compliment, and go on
with the Hiflory of their coming on Shore, where they
landed; he told me, they unhappily landed at a Place where
there were People without Proviilons; whereas had they
had the common Senfe to have put off to Sea again, and
gbne to another Ifland a little farther, they had found Provifions, tho' without People; there being an Ifland that
Way, as they have been:told, where there was Provifions,
tho' no People; that is to fay, that the Spaniards of Trinidad had frequently been there, and had fill'd the Ifland
with Goats and Hogs at fevefal Times; where they have
bred in fuch Multitude, and where Turtle and Sea-Fowls
were in fuch Plenty, that they could have been in no want
of Flefh, thod they had found no Bread; whereas here,
they were only ifutain'd with a few Roots and Herbs,
which they understood not, and which had no Subtance
in them, and which the Inhabitants gave them fparingly'
enough, and who could treat them no better, unlefs they
Would turn Canibals, and eat Mens Flefh, which was the
great Dainty of their' Country.
T' HEYr ave me an Account how' many Ways thev
rove to civilize the Savages they were with, and toteacA
themi



(95&gt;
them rational Cutomns in the ordinary. Way of Living, but
in vain  and how they retorted it upon them, as unjuf,that they who came there for Afflitance and Support, flould
attempt to fet up for Inftrutors of thofe that gave them
Bread; intimating, it feems, that none fhould fet up for
the Inftru&amp;ors of others, but thofe who could live without them.
THEY gave me difmal Accounts of the Extremities
they were driven to; how fometimes they were many
Days without any Food at all; the Ifland they were upon
being inhabited by a Sort of Savages that lived more indolent, and for that Reafon were lefs fupplied with the Neccflaries of Life, than they had Reafon to believe others
were in the fame Part of the World and yet they found,
that thefe Savages were les ravenous and voracious, than thofe
who had better Supplies of Food.
ALS o they added, That they could not but fee with
what Demonftrations of Wifdorn and Goodnefs the governing Providence of God direCts the Event of Things in
the World 'which, they faid, appear'd in their Circumflance; for if prefled by the Hardfiips they were under,
and the Barrennefs of the Country where they were, they
had fearch'd after a better Place to live in; they had then
been out of the Way of the Relief that happen'd to them
by my Means.
THIE N they gave mean Account, how the Savages, who'
they liv'd among, expe6ed them to go out with them into their Wars; And it was true, that, as they had FireArns with them, had they not had the Dilafier to lofe
their Ammunition, ihey fhould not have been ferviceable
only to their Friends, but have made themfelves terrible
both to Friends and Enemies but being without Powder
and Shot, and yet in a Condition, that they could not in
Reafon deny to go out with their Landlords to their Wars;
when they came into the Field of Battle, they were in a
Worfe Conditiont tiha  the Savages themfelves; for they
"neither had Blows nor Arrows, nor could they ufe thofe
the Savages gave thm; fo that they could do nothing but
ftand ifill andbewcunded with Arrows, fill they came up to'
the Tethi of their Enemy'; and then indeed th three Halbards they had, were of Ufe to them; and they would of.
ten drive a whole little Army before them, with thofe
^   A   r.   X.,.. n:;: &gt;  -:  f:. j-..



i-albards and fharpned Sticks put into the Muzzles of ther
Muskets: But that for all this they were Sometimes
furrounded with Multitudes, and in great Danger from
their Arrows; till at laft they found the Way to make
themfelves large Targets of Wood, which they covered
with Skins of wild Bealfs, whofe Names they knew not;
and thefe covered them from the Arrows of the Savages;
that notwithftanding thefe, they were fbmetimes in great
Danger, and were once five of them knock'd down together with the Clubs of the Savages, which was the Time
when one of 'em was taken Prifoner that is to fay, the
Spaniard, whom I had relieved: That at firRf they thought
had been killed, But when afterwards they heard he was
taken Prifoner, they were under the greateft Grief imaginable, and would willingly have all ventur'd their Lives
to have refcued him.
T H E Y told me, That when they were fo knock'd down,
the reft of their Company refcu'd them, and flood over
them, fighting till they were come to themf;lves, all but
him who they thought had been dead; and then they made
their Way with their Halbards and- Pieces, flanding clofe
together in a Line, thro' a Body of above a thoufand Savages, beating down all that came in their Way, got the
Vic&amp;ory over their Enemies, but to their great Sorrow, becauie it was with the lofs of their Friend; who, the other
Party finding him alive, carry'd off with fome others, as I
gave an Account in my former,
T HEY defcrib'd molt affedionately, how  they were'
furpriz'd with Joy at the Return of their Friend and Companion in Mifery, who they thought had been dcvour'd
by wild Beafts of the worfl Kind, (viz.) by wild Men
and yet how more and more they were Furpriz'd with the
Account he gave them of his Errand, and that there was
a Chriflian in any Place, nears much. more one that was
able, an4 had Hunmanity enough to contribute to their Deliverance,:
T   P Yx defcrib'd how they Fwere aftoniihd at the Sight
of the Relief I fent them, and at the Appearance of Loaves
of Bread, Things they had not feen fmice their coming, to
that miferable Phlacej how often they crowed it, and blelfed
it as Bread lent from Heaven  and what a reviving Cor,
dial it was to their Spirits to tafte it; as ai b of the other
Things



Things I had fent for their Supply. And after 'all, they would
have told me Something of the Joy they were in, at the
Sight of a Boat and Pilots to carry them away to the Perfon
and Place from whence all thefe new Comforts came; but
they told me it was impoffible to exprefs it by Words, for
their exceffive Joy, naturally driving them to unbecoming
Extravagancies, they had no Way to dei/cribe them, but by
telling me that they bordered upon Lunacy, having no
Way to give Vent to their Paffion, fuitable to the Senfi
that was upon them; that in fome it worked one Way,
and in fome another; and that fome of them, thro' a Sur*
prize of Joy, would burft out into Tears; others be half
mad, and others immediately faint,  This Difcourfe extreamly affle&amp;ed me, and call'd to my mind Friday's Extacy, when he met his Father, and the poor People's Extacy, when I took; them  up at Sea, after their Ship was
on fire: The Mate of the Ship's Joy, when he found himielf delivered in the Place where he expe&amp;ed to peri ih;
and my own Joy when after 28 Years Captivity, I foundr
a good Ship ready to carry me to my own Country: All
thefe Things made me more fenlible of the Relation of
thofe poor Men. and more affeated with it.
HA VI N G thus given a View of the State of Things,
as I found them, I muft relate the Heads of what I
did, for there People, and the Condition in which I left
them.   It was their Opinion and mine too, that they
would be troubled no more with the Savages; or that if
they were, they would be able to cut them off, if they
were twice as many as before; fo they had no Concern about that: Then I entred into a ferious Difcourfe with
the Spaniard whom I call'd Governour, about their Stay in
the Iland; for as I was not come to carry any of them
off, fo it would not be juft to carry off fome, and leave
others, who perhaps would be unwilling to flay, if their
Strength was diminified.
ON the other Hand, I told them, I came to elfablifh
them there, not to remove them; and then I let them
know, that I had brought with me Relief of fandry Kinds
for them; That I had been at a great Charge to fupply them
with all Things neceflary, as well for their Convenience,
as their Defence; and that I had fuch and fuch particular'
Perfons with me, as well to encreafe and recruit their
1E               Number,



Numbner, as by the particular neceffary Employments which
they were bred to, being Artificers, to allift them in thofe
Things, in which, at prefent, they were to feek.
THEY were altogether when I talk'd thus to them;
and before I delivered to 'em the Stores I had brought, I ask'd
them one by one,Ifthey had entirely forgotand bury'd the firft
Animofities thathad been among them, and could fhake hands
with one another, and engage in a firi&amp; Friendfhip and Union
of Intel eft, that fo there might be no more Mifunderftandings
or Jealo'lfies.
William Atkins, with abundance of Franknefs and good
Humour, faid, They had met with Affli&amp;ions enough to
make them al fober, and Enemies enough to make them
all Friends; that for his Part he would live and die
with them; and was ~o far from defigning any Thing
-againft the Spaniards, that he own'd theyhad done nothing
'to him, but what his own mad Humour made neceflary,
and what he would have done, and perhaps much worfe
in their Cafe i and that he would ask them Pardon, if I
deiired it, for the foolifh and brutifh Things he had done
to them; and was very willing and defirous of living in
Terms of entire Friendfllip and Union with them; and
would do any Thing that lay in his Power to convince
them of it; and as for going to England, he car'd not if
he did not go thither thefe twenty Years.
T HE Spaniards faid, They had indeed at firff difarm'd
and excluded WilL. Atkins and his two Countrymen for
their ill Condu&amp;, as they had let me know; and they appeal'd to me. for the Neceffity they were under to do fo:
But that William Atkins had behav'd himfelf fo bravely in
the gieat Fight they had with the Savages, and on feveral
Occalicls fince; and had fl;ew'd himfelf fo fithfultoand concern'd for, the general Intereft of them all, that they had
fo: gotten all that was paft, and thought he merited as much
to be trufted with Aims, and fupply'd with Neceffaries
as any of them; nd that they had teftify'd their Satiffacion in him,; by committing the Command to him,.
next to tl.Goyevmeour himfelf; And as they had an entire
Csnfidenic  n ii him and afl his Countrymen, fo they acknowledge'd 'hey-hd ieriited that Confidence by all the
Methods that htneft Men could merit to be valued, and
tmfted i and they mof heartily cmbrac'd the Occafi~  -    -.                           on



on of giving me this Aflurance, that they would never
have any Intereft feperate from one another.
UPON thefe frank and open Declarations of Friendfhip, we appointed the next Day to dine all together; and
indeed we made a fplendid Feat; I caufed the Ship's Cook
and his Mate to come on Shore, and drefs our Dinner;
and the old Cook's Mate we had on Shore, affifted: We brought on Shore fix Pieces of good Beef, and
four Pieces of Pork out of the Ship's Provilion, with our
Punch-Bowl, and Materials to fill it; and in particular, I
gave them ten Bottles of French Claret, and ten Bottles of
Englih Beer  Things that neither the Spaniards, or the
Engljlhjmen had taited for many Years; and which, it may
be fuppofed, theywere exceeding glad of.
T HE Spaniards added to our Feaft five whole Kids,
which the Cooks roafted; and three of them were lent
cover'd up clofe, on Board the Ship, to the.Seamen, that
they might Feaft on frefh Meat from on.Shore, as we did
with their Salt Meat from on Board.
A F  E R this Feaft, at which we were very innocently
merry, I brought out my Cargo of Goods, wherein, that
there might be no Difpute about dividing, I fhew'd them
there was fufficient for them all; and defir'd that they might
all take an equal Quantity of the Goods that wee for
wearing  that is to fay, equal when made up; as firft, I
diftributed Linnen flfficient to make every one of them
four Shirts; and at the Spaniards Requeft afterwards, made
them up fix; thefe were exceeding comfortable to them,
having been what, as I may fay, they had long iince forgot the Ufe of, or what it was to wear them.
I allotted the thin Englifh Stuffs, which I mention'd before, to make every one a light Coat, like a Frock, which
I judged fitteft for the Heat of the Seifon; cool and loofc,
and order'd, that whenever they decayed, they fhould
make more, as they thought fit: The like ror Pumps, Shoes,
Stockings and Hats, &amp;c.
I cannot exprefs what Pleafure, what Satisfa6ion, fat
upon the Countenances of all thefe poor Men, when they
faw the Care I had taken of them, and how well I had
furnifh'd them; they told me, I was a Father to theni, and
that having fuch a Correfpondent as I was, in fc remote
a Part of the World, it would make them forget that they
E z                 were



were left in a defolate Place i and they all voluntarily engag'd to me not to leave the Place without my Confnt.
TH EN I prefented to them the People I had biought
with me, palticulaily the Taylor, the Smith, and the two
Carpenters, all of them  moil necefary People; but aLove all, my general Artificer, than whom they could not
Name any Thing that was more ufeful to them; and
the Taylor, to flew his Concern for them, went to work
immediately, and, with my Leave, made them every one
a Shilt the firft Thing he didi and which was fill more,
he taught the Women, not only how to low and ftitch,
and uie the Needle, but made them  affift to make the
Shirts for their Husbands, and for all the reft.
A s to the Carpenters, I fcarce need mention, how ufeful they were, for they took in Pieces all my clluarfy, unhandy Things, and made them clever convenient Tables,
Stools, Bed-icLads, Cup-boards, Lockers, Shelves, and every
thing they wxanted of that Kind.
B u T to let them  fee how Nature made Artificers at
firif, I carried the Carpenters to fee William Atkins's Basket-houfe, as I call'd it, and they both own'd they never
few an Inflance of fuch natural Ingenuity before; nor any
Thing fo regular, and fo handily built, at leaft of its Kind:
And one of them, when he law it, after mufing a good
while, turning about to me, I am Cure, fays he, that Man
has no need of us, you need do nothing but give him Tools.
T 11 E N I brought them out all my Store of Tools, and
gave every Man a Digging Spade, a Shovel, and a Rake,
for we had no Harrows or Plows; and to evry feperate
Place, a Pick-ax, a Crow, a broad-Ax, and a Saw  always
appointing, that as often as any were broken, or worn out,
they fl:ould l-e fupply'd without grudging, out of the gene al Sto: cs that I left behind.
N AI L s, Staples, Hinges, Hammers, Chiffels, Knives,
SciPihrs, and all ibrts of Tools, and Iron-work, they had
wit hout Tale, as they requir'd, for no Man would careto
take more than they wanted, and he muft be a Fool that would
waft or fpoil them, on any Account whatever; and for
the Ufe of the Smith, I left two Ton of unwrought Iron for
a Supply.
M Y Magazine of Powder and Arms, which I brought
them, was fuch, even to ProfuIion, that they could not
but



(IOIx )
but reoyce at them, for now they could march as I ufed
to do, with a Musket jupon each Shoulder, if there was
Occafion, and were able to fight a Thoufand Savages, if
they had but fome little Advantages of Situation, w(hich
alfo they could not mifs of, if they had Occaflon.
I cary 'd on Shore with me the young Man, whofe
Mother was ftarv'd to Death,, and the Maid alfo, i e was
a fober well Educated Religious young Woman, and behav'd fo inofenfively, that every one ave her a good Word;
flie had indeed an unhappy Life with us, there being no
Woman in the Ship but herfcif, but ffe bore it with Patience: After a while feeing Things lo well order'd, and
in fo fine a Way of thriving upon my Ifland, and coniidering that they had neither Bufinefs or Acouaintance in the
Eafl-Indies, or Reafonfor taking fo long a Voyage: I Lay, confidering all this, both of them came to me, and delired i
would give them Leave to remain on the Ifland, and be
enter'd among my Family, as they call'd it.
I AGREED to it readily, and they had, a little Plat of
Ground allotted to them, where they had three Tents or
Houfes fet up, furrounded with a Basket-work, Pallifado'd likd
A[tkins's, and adjoining to his Plantation: Their Tents were
contriv'd, fo that they had each of them a Room  apart
to lodge in, and a middle Tent like a great Store-houfe to
lay all their Goods in, and to eat and drink in; and now
the other two Engli/Jmen emov'd their Habitation to the
fame Place, and fo the Ifland was divided into three Colonies and no more, 'viz the Spaniards with old Fridsay, and.
the firft Servants, at my old Habitation under the Hill;
which was, in a Word, the capital City; and where they
had fo enlarg'd and extended their Works, as well under
as on the outfide of the Hill, that they liv'd, tho' perfe&amp;ly
conceal'd, yet full at large  Never was there fuch a little
City in a Wood, and fo hid, I believe, in any Part of the
World; for I verily believe, a thoufand Men might have
rang'd the Iland a Month, and if they had not known there
was fuch a Thing, and look'd on purpofe for it, they
would not have found it; for the Trees flood fb thick and
fo clofe, and grew fo faft matte'd into one another, that
nothing but cutting them down firiT, could difcover the
Place; except the two narrow Entrances, where they went
in and out, could be found. which was not very eafy; one
E                         of



of them was juft down at the Water's Edge on the Side
of the Creek, and it was afterwards above two hundred
Yards to the Place j and the other was up the Ladder at
twice, as I have already formerly defcrib'd it; and they had
a large Wood thick planted alfo, on the Top of the Hill,
which contained above an Acre, which grew apace, and
cover d the Place fiom all Diicovery there, with only one
narrow Place between two Trees not eafy to be difcover'd4
to enter on that Side.
THE other Colony was that of Will. Atkins's, where
there were four Families of Englihmen, I mean thofe I had
left there, with their Wives and Children; three Savages
that were Slaves; the Widow and Children of the Engljhman that was kill'd; the young Man and the Maid; and
by the Way, we made a Wife of her alfo, before we went
away: There were alfo the two Carpenters and the Taylor, who I brought with me for them   alfo the Smitth
who was a very neceffary Man to them, efpecially as a
G'nfmith, to take care of their Armsi and my other Man,
who I call'd, Jack of all Trades i who was in himfelf as
good, almoft as twenty Men, for he was not only a very
Ingenious Fellow, but a very merry Fellow, and before I
went away, we marry'd him to the honeft Maid that came
with the Youth in the Ship, who I mention'd before.
A N D now I fpeak of Marrying, it brings me naturally
to fay fomething of the French Eccefiaftic that I hadbrought
with me out of the Ship's Crew, who I took up at Sea.
It is true, this Man was a Roman, and perhaps it may give
Offence to fome hereafter, if I leave any Thing extraordinary
uponRecord, of aMan, who, before Ibegin, I muft, (to fet
him out injuft Colours) reprefent in Terms very much to his
Difadvantage, in the Account of Proteftants as firfi, that
he was a Papif; fecondly, a Popifh Prieft  and thirdly, a
trench Popifh Prieft.
B UT luftice demands of me to give him a due Character; and I muft fay, he was a grave, fober, pious, and moflt
religious Perfon; exaft in his Life, extenfive in his Charity, and exemplar in almoft every Thing he did; what
then can any one fay, againfl my being very enfible of the
Value of fuch a Man, notwithfandng his Profeffion
Though it may be my Opinion, perhaps, as well as the
Opinion of others, who fiall read this, that he was miAakcn.         -                               Ti



T HE firft Hour that I began to converge with him, af
tcr he had agreed to go with me to the Eair-Irdies, I found
Reafon to delight exceedingly in his Converfation  and he
firft began with me about Religion in the moft obliging
Manner imaginatle.
S i R, fays he, you have not only, under God, (and at
that he coofsd his Breaft) fav'd my Life, but you have admitted me to go this Voyage in your Ship, and by your
obliging Civility have taken me into you Family, giving
me an Opportunity of free Convci fation. Now Sir, fays
he, you fee by my Habit, what my Profefflon is, and I
guefs by your Nation what yours is: I may think it is my
Duty, and doubtless it is fo, to ufe my utmoft Endeavours,
on all Occafions, to bring all the Souls I can to the Knowledge of the Truth, and to embrace the CatholickDoctrine
but as I am here under your Permiffion, and in your Family, I am bound in Juflice to your Kindnefs, as well as
in Decency and good Manners, to be under your Government; and therefore I flaillnor, without your Leave, enter
into any Debates on the Points of Religion, in which we
~may not agree, farther than you fall give me Leave.
I T o L D him, his Carriage was fo modeft, that I could
not but acknowledge it; that it was true, we were fuch
People as they call'd Hereticks; but that he was not the
firit Catholick that I had convers'd with, without falling
into any Inconveniencies, or carrying the Queftions to any
Height in Debate; That he fhould not find himfelf the
the worfe us'd for being of a different Opinion from us,
and if we did not converfe without any Diflike on either
Side upon that Score, it would be his Fault, not ours.
H E reply'd, that he thought our Converfation might
be eafily feparated from Difputes: That it was not his Bufinefs to cap Principles with every Man he difcours'd with;
and that he rather defir'd me to converfe with him as a
Gentleman, than as a Religieufe; that if I would give hint
Leave at any Time to difcourfe upon religious Subje&amp;,s
he would readily comply with it; and that then, he did
not doubt but I would allow him alfo to defend his own
Opinions, as well as he could; but that without my
Leave, he would not break in upon me with any fuch
Thing.
F4                      ts



i- told me farther, that he would not ceafe to do all
that became him in his Office, as a Priefr, as well as a
private Chriflian, to procure the good of the Ship, and the
Safety of all that was in her; and though  el hars we
would not join with him, and he could not piay 'ri:th us,
he hop'd he might pray for us, which he would do upon
all Occaiions: In this Manner we conversed, and as he
was of a molt obliging Gentleman-like Behaviovr; fo he
was, if I may be allow'd to fay fo, a Man of good Senfe,
and as I'believe, of great Learning.
H E gave me a moft diverting Account of his Life, and
of the many extraordinary Events of it; of many Adventures which had befallen him in the few Years -that he had
been abroad in the World, and particularly this was very
remarkable, (,viz.) That during the Voyage he was now
engagd in, he had the Misfortune to be five Times fliip'd.
and unfhip'd, and never to go to the Place whither any of
the Ships, he was in, were at firft defign'd: That his firtf
Intent was to have gone to Martinico, and that he went
on board a Ship bound thither, at St. Male; but being
forc'd into Lisbon, by bad Weather, the Ship receiv'd fome
Damage, by running a-ground in the Mouth of the River
Tagus, and was oblig'd to unload her Cargo there; that
finding a Portguefe Ship there bound to the Maderas, and
ready to fail, and fuppofing he fhould eafily meet with
a yefel there bound to Martinico; he went on board, in
order to fail to the Maderas j but the Mafter of the Portuguefe Ship being but an indifferent Mariner, had been out
i his Reckoning, and they drove to Fial; where, however he happen'd to find a very good Market for his Cargo, which was Corn, and therefore refolv'd not to go to
the Maderas, but to load Salt at the Ifle of May, and to go
away to Newfoundland: He had no Remedy in this Exigence, but to go with the Ship, and had a pretty good
Voyage as far as the Banks, fo they call the Place where
they catch the Fifh, where meeting with a French Ship,
bound from France to 4utebeck, in the River of Canada,
and from  thence to Aartinico, to carry Provifions, he
thought he fliould have an Opportunity to compleat his
firft Delign: But when he came to @ ueeck, the Mafter of
the Ship dy'd, and the Ship proceedd no farther; fo the
next Voyage he flip'd himfelf for France, in the Ship
that



that Was burnt, when we took them up at Sea, and then
fhip'd them with us for the Eaf-Indies, as I have already
faid: Thus he had been difappointed in five Voyages, all,
as I may call it, in one Voyage, betides what I frall have
Occafion to mention farther of the fame Perfon.
B u T, I fhall not make Digrefions into other Mens Stories, which have no Relation to my own.   I return to
what concerns our Affair in the Ifland: He came to me
one Morning, for he lodg'd among us, all the while we
were upon the Ifland; and it happen'd to be juft when I
was going to vifit the Englihmen's Colony, at the fartheft
Part of the Ifland  I fay, he came to me and told me,
with a very grave Countenance, that he had for two or
three Days delir'd an Opportunity of fome Difcourfe wirh
me, which he hop'd fiould not be diipleafingto me, becauke
he thought it might in fome Meafurecorrefpond with my
general Defign, which was the Profperity of my new Colony, and perhaps might put it, at leaft more than he yet
thought it was, in the WVay of God's Bleffing.
I L O  K' D a little furpriz'd at the laft Part of his Difcourfe, and turning a little flort, Htow Sir! faid I, can it
be faid, that we are not in the Way of God's Bleffing, after fuch vifible A4jiftances, and wenderful Deliverances as
we have feen here, and of which I have given you o large
Account?
I F you had pleas'd Sir, faid he (with a World of Modcfly,
and yet with great Reaiinefs) to have heard me, you would
have found no room to have been cifpleafed, much lefs to
think fo hard of me, that I flnould fuggft, that you have
not had wonderful Affiftances and Deliverances; and I
hope, on your Behalf, that you are in the Way of God's
Bleffing, and your Defign is exceeding good, and will profper: But Sir, faid he, tho' it were more fo, than is even
poffible to you, yet there may be fome among you that
are not equally right in their ACtions;: And you know,
that in the Story of Ifrad, one Achan in the Camp rec
mov'd God's Blefllng from them, and turn'd his Hand fo
againft them, that fib and thirty of them, though not concei n'd in the Crime, were the Objets of Divine Vengeance,
and bore the Weight of that Punifhment.
I w A' fenfibly touch d with his Difcourfe, and toil
him his Inference was fo juI, and the twhole Decign feem d
E                          f So



(.od6 &gt;
fo fincere, and was really fo religious in its own Nature,
that I was very forry I had interrupted him, and begg'd
him to go on; and in the mean Time, becaufe it feem'd,
that what we had both to fay, might take up fome Time,.
I told him, I was going to the EnglifJjmen's Plantations,
and ask'd him to go with me, and we might difcourfe of
it. by the Way: He told me, he would more willingly
wait on me thither, becaufe there partly the Thing wasated, which he defir'd to fpeak. to me about; fo we walk'd
on, and I preis'd him  to be free and plain with me, in
what he had to fay.
W H Y then Sir, fays he, be pleas'd to give me Leave to.
lay down a few Propofitions, as the Foundation of what I
have to fay, that we may not differ in the general Principles,.
tho' we may be of iome differing Opinions in the Piactice of Particulars. Firft, Sir, tho' we differ in fome of
the Do&amp;trinal Articles of Religion; and it is very unhappy
that it is fo, efpecially in the Cafe beforeus, as I flall fhew
afterwards: Yet there are fome-general Principles in which
we both agree, (viz.) firfl, That there is a God; and that
this God having given us fome flated general Rules for our
Service and Obedience, we ought not willingly and knowingly to offend him; either by neglecing to do what he
has commanded, or by doing what he has exprefly forbidden: And. let our different Religions be what they willI
this general Principle is readily own'd by us all,. That the
Bi fling of God does not ordinarily follow a preiumptuous
fnning againft his Command; and every good' Chritfian,
will be afletionately concern'd to prevent any that are under his Care, living in a total; Ncgled of God and his
Commmands,. It is not your Men being Pro^fiants, what â
ever my Opinion may be of fuch, thatdifchages me from
being concern'd for their Souls, and from endeavouring, if
it lies befol e me, that they fhould live in as. littlt Diftancefiom  and Enmity with their Maker, as poffibl; efpecally, if you give me Leave to meddle fo far ii your Ciicuit.
I c cau L D not yet imagine vwat he aim*d at, and told'
him, I ganted all he had faid, and thank'd h'm, that he'
v~ould   far concel n himrfelf for us; and begg'd he would1
e.pizin t'l  Particulars of what he had obferv'd, that like
Exa&gt;



Cro7)
yofiua, to take his own Parable, I might put away the
accurfed Thing from us.
WHY then, Sir, fays he, I will take the Liberty you
give me; and there are three Things, which, if I amright,
mull Itand in the Way of God's Bleffing upon your Endeavours here, and which I fliould rejoice for your Sake,
and their own, to ife remov'd. And, Sir, fays he, I promife myfelf, that you will fully agree with me in tlhem
all, as foon as I name them; epecially, becaufe I flall convince you, that every one of them may, with great Eaik,.
and very much to your Satisfa6tion, be remedyd.
H E gave me no Leave to put in any more Civilities,
but went on. Firft, Sir, fays he, you have here four Englitnmen, who have fetch'd Women from among the Savages, and have taken them  as their Wives, and have had
many Children by them all, and yet are not marry'd to
them after any lated legal Manner, as the Laws of God
and Man require; and therefore are yet, in the Scnfe of
both, no lefs than Adulterers, and living in Adultery. Tot
this, Sir, fays he, I know you will obije t  that there was
no Ciergyman or Prieft of any Kind, or of any Profefiion,
to perform the Ceremony; nor any Pen and Ink, or Paper, or write down a Contra&amp; of Mahrriage, and have it
lign'd between them. And I know alfo, Sir, wlat the
Spaniard Governour has told you T I mean of the Agreement that heoblig'd them to make, when they took thcil
Women, (zz.    That they fliould chufc them out by Con,
fent, and keep feparately to them; which, by the Way,
is nothing of a Marriage, no Agreement with the Women,
as Wives, but only an Agreement among themfcives, to
keep them fiom qnarrelling.
B u T, Sir, the Elience of the Sacrament of Matrimony
(0o he calld it, being a Roman) confifts not only in the
nutual Cbnfent of the Parties to takle one another, as Man
nd Wife, but in the fcrmal and le.al.Obligtion, that therm
is in the Contra&amp;, to compel the Man and VWVetn  at. al
Times,, to own and acknowledge each other; ol-ligin tl;
Man to abftain fiom nll other Women, to. enat'ze.i no
other Contradc vwhile thefe iubiilt., ad and on nll occailol,
asAbility allows, to provide honeflly for. them  and rlciir
Childreni and to o iige the Wtcman to tie lame, or lCke
Conditions, mwtatis nmutandlis, on thciir S!idc..  Now


Now, Sir, a ys be, thefe Men may, when they pleafe,
or when Occalion prefents, abandon thefe Women, difown their Children, leave them to perifh, and take other
IWomen, and marry them   whilft thefe are living. And
here he added, with fome Warmth, How, Sir, is God honour d in this unlawful Liberty? And how  f all a BleiTing
fucceed your Endeavours in this Place, However good in
themfelves, and however fincere inyour DeJign, while the'e
Men, who at prefent are your Subjecs, tunder your abfolute Government and Dominion, are allow'd by you to live
in open Adultery?
I    CONFESS, I was truck at the Thing it felf, but
much more with the convincing Arguments he fupported
it with; for it was certainly true, that though they had
no Clergyman upon the Spot, yet a formal Conti ad on
both Sides, made before Witnefls, and confirm'd by any
Tuken, which they had all agreed to be bound by, though
it had been but the breaking a Stick between them, engaging the Men to own there Women for their Wives,
upon all Occafions; and never to abandon them or their
Childien, and the Women to the fame with their Huflands, had been an efflctual lawful Marriage in the
Sight of God  and it was a great Neglc&amp; that it was not
done.
B v  I thought to have gotten off with my young Prieft,
by telling him, that all that Part was done when I was
not here, and they had liv'd fo many Years with them
now, that if it was an Adultery, it was pall Remedy,
thcy could do nothing in it now.,
S IR, fay  he, asking your Pardon for fuch F R E  -
j) Po M, you are,ight in this, that it being done in
your Abkence, you could not be chared witl that Pait
of the Crime: But I befeech you, flatter not your
lilf, that you are not therefore under an Obligation
to do your utmoft now, to put an End to it: How
can you think, but that, let the Time pafl lie on
who it will, all the Guilt, for the Future, will lie
entirely upon you? Becaufe it is certainly in your
Power now   to put an End to it, and in no Body's
Power bi t yours.
I WAS fo dull ii l, that I did not take him right; but I.inagin'd, thay by putting an End to it, he meant that I
fl.,ould



fhould part them, and not fuffer them to live together any
longer: And I faid to him, I could not do that by any
Means, for that it would put the whole Ifland into Confulion. He feem'd furpriz'd that I could fo far miflake
him. No, Sir, fJays fe, I do not mean, that you flhould
now fepaiate thlem, but legally and effetually marry them
now; and as, Sir, ny Way of narrying them may not be
fo eafy to reconcile them to, tho' it will be as effiteual,
even by your own Laws, fo your Way may be as well before God, and as valid among Men; 1 mean, by a written
ContraSt, fign'd by both Man and Woman, and by all the
Witnefles prefent, which all the Laws of Europe would decree to be valid.
I was amaz'd to fee fo much true Piety, and fo much
Sincerity of Zeal, befides the unufial Impartiality in his
Difcouife, as to his own Partyor Church; and fucha true
Warmth for the preferving People that he had no Knowledge of, or Relation to; i fay, for preferving them from
tranfg;eiring the Laws of God; the like of which, I had
indeed not met with any where: But recollecting what he
had laid, of marrying them by a written Contrac, which
I knew would fland too; I return'd it back upon him, and
told him, I granted all that he had laid to be juft, and on
his Part very ind, that T would difcourfe with the Men upon
the Point now, when I came to them: And I knew no
Reafon why they fiou'd fcruple to let him marry them all,
which I knew well enough would be granted to be as authentick and valid in Engand, as if they were marry'd by
one of our own Clergymen: What was afterwards done
in this Matter, I fhall fpeak of it by it felf.
I THEN prefs'd him to tell me what was the fecondConmplaint which he had to make, acknowledging, that I was
very much his Debtor for thefirfl, and thank d him hearti,
ly for it. He told me, he woold ufe the fame Freedom
and Plainnefs in thefecond, and hop'd I would take it as
well: And this was, that notwithffanding thefe Englifh
Sub.jecs of mine, as he call'd them, had lived with thofe
Women for almoft feven Years, and had taught them to
lpeak Englifh, and even to read it; and that they were, as
he pereiv'd, Women of tolerablle Underflanding, andrcapable of Inftrucion; yet they had not to this Hour taught them
any thing of the Chriftian Religion no, not fo mueh as to
know



know that there was a God, or a Wornfip, or in what Manner God was to be ferved, or that their own Idolatry, and
worflipping they knew not who, was falfe an. abfurd.
T H I S, he faid, was an unaccountable Negiet, and what
God would certainly call them to account for, and perhaps
at laft take the Work out of their Hands: He fpoke this
very affeCtionately and warmly; I am perfwaded, fays he,
had thofe Men lived in the frvage Country, whence their
Wives came, the Savages would have taken more Pains to
have brought them to be Idolaters, and to worflip the Devil, than any of thefe Men, ft far as he could fee, had taken
with them to teach them the Knowkkdge of the true God:
Now, Sir,fail he, tho' I do not acknowledge your Religion, or you- mine, yetweif:ould be all glad to fee the Devil s Servants, and the Subjc&amp;s of his Kingdom, taught to
know the general Principles of the Chrillian Religion; that
they mngh t, at leaft, hear of God, and of a Redeemer, and
of the Refuirretion, and of a future State, Things which
we all?telieve; they had at leaff been fo much nearer coming into the Bofom of the trueChurch, than they are now
in the publJick Profeflion of Idolatry, and Devil-worfiip.
I coUrf, hold no longer; I took him in my Arms, and
cmbra-'i him with an Excel. of Paflion: How far, faid I
to him-, laeve I leen from undtrftanding the moft effential
Part of n; Chriftian, (viz.) to love the fntereft of theChritfian C  eurch, and the good of other Mens Souls? I fearce
have k-own what belongs to being a Chriftian: 0, Sir,
do not f;  fo, reply'd he, this Thing is not your Fault: No,
fays I, hItxt why did I neverlay it to Heart as well as you? 'Tis

ThaZk.s



Thanks for it; What follow'd on this Account, I fial'
mention alfo again in it.s Place.
I Now prefs'd him for the third Article, in which we
wei el to blame; Why really, fays he, it is of the fame Nature, and I will proceed, asking yur Leave, with the fame
Plainnefs as before; it is about your poor Savages yonder,
who are, as I may fay, your conquer'd Subiets: It is a
Maxim, Sir, that is, or ought to be receiv'd among all Chriflians, of what Church, or pretended Church foever, (vi.)That Chriiian Knowledge ought to be propagated hy all pof-.f6ble Means, and on all pojible Occajons: 'Tis on this Principle that our Church fends Mifiionalies into Pe)iia, India,
and China, and that our Clergy, even of the fuperior Sort,
willingly engage in the moil hazardous Voyages, and the
moft dangerous Refidence among Muvthere-s and Barbari â
ans, to teach them the Knowledge of the true God, and to
bring them over to embrace the Chrifiian Faith: Now,
Sir, you have fuch an Oppo:tunity here, to have fix or feven and Thiity poor Savages brought over from  Idolatryto the Knowledge of God, ther.Maker and Redeemer, that
I wonder how you can pafs fichan Occafion of doing Good,
which is really worth the Expence ofa Man's whole Life.
I WAS. now rf-uck DuImb indeed, and had not one Word'
to fay: I had here a Spirit of true Chriftian Zeal for God
and Religion before me, let his pa; ticular Principles be of
what kind ibever; as for me, I had not ~o much as entertain d a Thought of this in my Heart before, and I believef-ould not have thought of it; for I look'd upon thefe Savages as Slaves, and People, who, had we any Work for
them  to do, we would ha' ufcd as fuch, or would have
been glad to have tranfported them  to any other Part of
the World; for our Bufnefs was to get rid of them, anl
we would all have feen fatisfy'd, if they had- been fent to
any Country, fo they had never Ieen their own: But to the
Cafe, I fay, I was confounded at his Difcoutfe, and knew,
not what Anfwcr to make him: He look'd earneftly at
me, eicing nme in 'fme D.ifolder; Sir, fas he, I f'all be
vciy forry, if what I have taid gives you any Offence:
No, no fys I, I am- ofifendcd with no Body but my
felf; but 1 am  perfeftly onfounded, not only to think
that I fhould never take any Notice of- this before, but
with rcflcting  what Notice, I am. able to take of it.
now,



now; You know, Sir, fid I, what Circumftances T am
in, I am bound to the Eafi-Indies, in a Ship freighted by
Merchants, and to whom it would be an unfufferable piece
of Injuftice to detain their Ship here, the Men lying all this
while at Vi6uals and Wages upon the Owner's Account;
It is true, I agreed to be allow'd twelve Days here, and if
I flay more, I muft pay 3 1. Sterling per Diem Demorage,
nor can I flay upon Demorage above eight Days more,
and I have been here thirteen Days already, fo that I am
perfetly unable to engage in this Work, unlefs I would
fufier my felf to be left behind here again, in which Cafe,
if this tingle Ship fhould mifcarry in any part of her Voyage, I fhould be juft in the fame Condition that I was left
in here at firft, and from which I have been fo wonderfully delivered.
H E own'd the Cafe was very hard upon me, as to my
Voyage; but hid it home upon my Confcience, whether
the Biefing of faving feven and.thiirty Souls, was not worth
my venturing all I had in the World for? I was not fo
fenfible of that as be was, and I return'd upon him thus;
Why, Sir, it is a valuable Thing indeed, to be an Inftrument in God's Hand to convert feven and thirty Heathens
to the Knowledge of Chiift, but as you are an Ecclefiaflick, and are given over to that Work, fo that it feems
naturally to fall into the Way of your Profeffion; how  is
it then, that you do not rather offer your felf to undertake
it, than prefs me to it?
U P ON this he fac'd about, juft before me, as we walk'd
along, and putting me to a full Stop, made me a very low
Bow; I moft heartily thank God and you, Sir, fays he,
for giving me fo evident a Call to fo bleffed a Work; and
if you think your felf difcharg'd from it, and defire me
to undertake it, I will moft readily do it, and think it a
happy Reward for all the Hazards and Difficulties of fuch
a broken, difappointed Voyage as I have met with, that I
have dropt at laft into fo glorious a Work.
I DISCOVER'D a kind of Rapture in his Face while he
fpoke this to me; his Eyes fparkeld like Fire, his Face
glowd, and his Colour came and went, as if he had been
talling into Fits; in a. Word, he was fir'd With the Toy of
being embark'd in fuch a Work: I paus'd a confiderabte
while, before I could tell.what to fay to him, for I was
really



really furpriz'd to find a Man of fuch Sincerity and Zeal,
and carry'd out in his 7Zeal, beyond the ordinary Rate of
of Men, not of his Profemflon only, but even of any ProfcfTion whatfoever: But after I had confider'd it a while,
I ask'd him ferioufly if he was in camnef, and that he
\ would venture on the finglc Conflderation of an Attempt
on thofe poor People, to lbe lock'd up in an unplanted Ifland for, perhaps, his Life and at laft might not know
whetl:er he floould be able to do them any good, or not?
E tu n'd fl ort upon me, and ask'd me what I call d a Venture? Pray, Sir, fad-k e, what do you think I contented
to go in your Ship to the Eafl-Itndies for? Nay, faid I, that
I know not, unlefs it was to preach to the Indians: Doubtlefs it was, faid he; and do you think if I can convert thefe
feven and thirty Men to the Faith of Chrift, it is not worth
my time, tho' I fhould never be fetch'd off the Ifland again? Nay, is it not infinitely of more Worth to fave ~o
many Souls, than my Life is, or the Life of twenty more
of the fame Profefion? Yes, Sir, fays he, I would give
Chrift and the bleffed Virgin Thanks all my Days, if I
could be made the leaft happy Inlfrument of faving the
Souls of thefe poor Men, tho' I was never to fet my Foot
'off this Ifland, or fee my native Country any more::But
fince you will honour me, fays he, with putting me into
this Work, for which I will pray for you all the Days of my
L/fe; I have one humble Petition to you, fasd he, belides.
What is that, faid I? Why, fays he, it is, that you will leave
your Man Friday with me, to be my Interpreter to them,
and to affift me; for without fome Help I cannot fpcak
to them, or they to me.
I WAS fenfibly troubled at his requeffing Friday, becaufe
I could not think of parting with him, and that for many
Reafons; he had been the C;ompanion of my Travels; he
was not only faithful to me, but Sincerely Afle&amp;ioinate to
the laft degree; and I had refolv'd to do fbmething confi4 derable for him, if he out-liv'd me, as it was probable he
would: Then I knew that, as I had bred Friday up to be
a Proteflant, it would quite confound him to bring him to
embrace another Profefion and he would never, while his
Eyes were open, believe that his old Mafterl was an Heretick, and would be damn'd; and this might in the End
ruin the poor Fellow's Principles, and bo turn him back
again to his firif Idolatry.                   H o w


Ho   r EV E, a fudden Thought reliev'd me in this Strait,
arid it was this; I told him I could not fay that I was
willing to part with Friday on any Account whatever i
tho' a 'Wo:k that to him was of more Value than his
Life, ought to be to me of much more Value than the
keeping or parting with a Servant: But on the other hand,
I was pei fwaded that Friday would by no Means content
to part with me, and then to force him to it without his Confent, would be manifeft Injuftice; becaue I had
promifed I would never put him away, and he had proinis'd and engag'd to me that he would never leave me,
'nlcfs I put him away,
H E feem'd very much concern'd at it, for he had no
rational Accefs to thefe poor People, feeing he did not underfland one Word of their Language, nor they one Word
of his. To remove this Difficulty, I told him Friday's Father had learn'd Spanijh, which I found he alfo underftood,
and he fhould ferve him for an Interpreter; ~o he was
much better fatisfied, and nothing could periivade him but
he would ftay to eiideavour to convert them; but Providence gave another, and very happy Turn to all this.
I c o ME back now to the firif Part of his Obje&amp;ions.
When we came to the Englifhmen, I fent for them all together, and after fome Account given them of what I had
done for them, viz. what necefliry Things I had provide
ed for them, and how  they were' ditributed, which they
were fenfible of, and very thankful for; I began to talk to
them of the fcandalous Life they led, and gave them a full
Account of the Notice the Clergyman had already taken
of it, and arguing how unchritian and irreligious a Life it
was: I firft ask'dthem if they were married Men or Batchelors? They foon explain'd their Condition to me, and fhew'd
me that two of them were Widowers, and the other three
were tingle Men, or Batchelors: I ask'd them with what
Confciences they could take thefe Women and lie with
them, as they had done, call them their Wives, and have
fo many Children by them, and not be marry'd lawfully
to them?
THEY all gave me the Anfwer that I expe&amp;ed, viz.
that there was no Body to marry them,; that they agreed
before the Governour to keep them as their Wives, and
to keep them and own them as their Wives; and they
thought,



thought, as Things flood with them, they were as legaly
manried as if they had been ma lied by a PaicLn, and with
all the Formalities in the Woild.
I TO L D them, that no doulbt they were married in the
Sight of God, and were bound in Confcience to keep them
as their Wives, but that the Laws of Men bein- ot hetile,
they might pretend they were not married, and ib defert
the poor Women and Children hereafter; and that their
Wives being poor defolate Women, friendlefs and moneylefs, would have no Way to help themfelves: I therefore
told them, that unlefs I was aflur'd of their honef! Intent, I
could do nothing for them; but wonld take care that what
I did fhould-be or the Women and their Childrdn without
them; and that unlefs they would give fome A furances
that they would marry the Women, I could not think it
was convenient they ihould continue together as Man and
Wife, for that it was both fcandalous to Men, and offenfive to God, who they could not think would blefs them, if
they went on thus.
AL L this went on as I expe&amp;ed, and they told me, eIpecially Will. Atkins, who fem'd now  to fpeak for the
retl, that they lov'd their Wives as well, as if they had been
born in their own Native Country, and would not leave
them uponany'Account whatever; and they did verily believetheir Wives were as viltuous and as modeff, and did to the
utmoft of their Skill, as much for them and for their Children,
as any Women could poffibly do, and they would not part
with them on any Account: And Will. Atkirs for his own
particular added, if any Man would take him away, and
offer to carry hini home to England, and make him Captarn of the belf Man of War in the Navy, he W6uld not
go with hirfi, if he might not carry his Wife and Children
with him; and if there was a Clergyman in the Ship, hewould be married to her now,, with all his Heart.
T HI s was juft as I would have it; the Prieft was not.
with me at that Moment, but was not far off: So to try
him farther, I told him I had a Clergyman with me, and,
if he was fincere, I would have him  married the next
Moarning, and bid him confider of it, and talk with the reft.
he faid as for himfelf, he need not confider of it at all, for
he was very ready to do it, and was glad I had a Minifter
with ame, and he believ'd they would be all willing alfo: '
then



&lt;  1 I6 )
then told him, that my Friend the Minifrer was a Frenchman,.ad could not fpeak Ej:gllhJ, but that I would ad the
Clcrk bctwv.c-n them: He never fo much as ask'd me whc
ther he was a Pa3pii or Protcetant, which l was indeed what
I was afraid of: But, I tay, they never enquired about it.
So we parted, I went back to my Clergyman, and Will.
Atkins went in to talk with his Companions: I deiir'd
the French Gentleman not to fay any thing to them, till
the Butincfs was thorough ripe, and I told him what Anfwer the BMen had given me.
B E F o R E I went from their Quarter, they all came to
me, and told me, they had been confidering what I had
faid; that they were very glad to hear I had a Clergyman
in my Company, and they were very willing to give me
the Satisfaceion I defir'd, and to be formally married as
foon as I pleas'd, for they were far from deiiring to part
with their Wives, and that they meant nothing but what
was very honeft when they chofe them; fo I appointed
them to meet me the next Morning, and that in the mean
time they fhould let their Wives know the meaning of
the Marriage-Law; and that it was not only to prevent
any Scandal, but alfo to ollige them, that they fhould siot
forfake them, whatever mignt happen.
T HE Women were eafily made fenfible of the Meaning
of the Thing, and were very well fatisfied with it, as, indeed, they had Reafon to be: fo they faild not to attend
all together at my Apartment the next Morning, where 1,
brought out my Clergyman; and tho' he had not on a Mi,
nifter's Gown, after the Manner of England, or the Habit
of a Prieff, after the Manner of France yet havirng a black
Veft fomething like a Caffock, with a Salh round it, he
did not look very unlike a Minifter, and as for his Language, I was his Interpretcr.
B U T the Serioufnes of his Behaviour to them, and the
Scruples he made of marrying the Women, becaufe they
were not baptiz d, and profe~f d Chriflians, gave them an
exceeding Reverence for his Perfon; and the; e was no need
after that to enquire whether he was a Clergyman or no.
INDEED, I was afraid his Scruple would have been
carry'd fo far, as that he would not have marry'd them at
all nay, notwithftanding all I was able to fay to him, he
reffted me, though modeltly, yet very fteadily, gnd at laft
refufed



refuted abfolutely to marry them, t nls he hhad ffiif talk'd
with the Men, and the V omen too; and though at firif I
wa a little backward to it, yet at laft I agreed to it with
a good Will, perceiving the Sincerity of his Delign.
W   EN he came to them, he let them know, that I
had acotainted him  with their Circumftances, and with
the p:eient Defign: That he was very willing to perform
that Part of his Function, and marry them as I had defir'd
but that before he could do it, he muft take the Liberty
to talk with then: He told them, That in the Sight of
all indifierent Men, and in the Senfe of the Laws of Society, they had liv'd all this while in an open Adultery;  and
that it was true, that nothing but the Confenting to marry, or efitreually feparating them fiom one another now,
could put an End to it; but there was a Difficulty in it
too, with refpe&amp; to the Laws of Chrifian Matrimony,
which he was not fully fatisfy'd about, vi'z. That of marrying one that is a profefs'd Chrftian, to a Savage, an Idolater,
and a Heathen, one that is not baptizd; and yet that he
did not fee that there was Time left for it, to endeavour
to perfuade the Women to be baptiz'd, or to profcis the
Name of Chrifi, whom they had, he doubted, heard nothing of, and without which they could not be baptiz'd.
HE told them, He doubted they were but indifferent
Chriftians themfelves that they had but little Knowledge
of God, or of his Ways: and therefore he could not expeft that they had faid much to their Wives on that Head
yet; but that unlefs they would promife him to uei their
Endeavours with their Wives, to perfuade them to become
Chriftians, and would as well as they could inftru&amp;t them
in the Knowledge and Belief of God that made them, and
to worfhip Jefus Chrift that redeem'd them, he could not
marry them    ' for he would have no Hand in joyning Chriftians with Savages; nor was it confitent with the Princidles of the Chrfftian Religion  and was indeed exprefly
forbidden in God's Law.
T iE Y heard all this very attentively, and I deliver'd it
very faithfully to them, from his Mouth, as near his own
Words as I could, only fbmetimes adding fomething of
my own to convince, them how juft it was, and how I
)was of his Mind; and I always very faithfully diftinguifh'd
between what I faid from  my fe l  and what were the
Clergy


Clergyman's Words.   They told me, it was very true,
what the Gentleman had faid, that they were but very indifSirent ChrifJians themfelves, and that they had never
talkd to their Wives about Religion: Lord, Sir! fays
Will. Atkins, How  fhould we teach them    Religion?
Why we know nothing our felves; and befides, Sir, faid
he, fhould we go to talk to them of God, and Yefus Chrif,
and Heaven and Hell, 'twould be to make them  laugh at
us, and ask us, What we believe our felves? And if we
fhould tell them we believe all the Things that we fpeak
of to them, fuch as of good People going to Heaven, and
wicked People to the Devil, they would ask us, Where
we intended togo our felves, who believeall this, and yet are
filch wicked Fellows, as we indeed are? Why, Sir,faid,
IWill. 'tis enough to give them  a Surfeit of Religion at
firil Hearing, Folks muft have fome Religion themfelves,
before they pretend to teach other People: Will. Atkins,
faid I to him i though I am afraid what you fay has too
much Truth in it, yet can you not tell your Wife that
fhe's in the wrong? That there is a God and a Religion
better than her own; that her Gods are Idols, that they
can neither hear nor fpeak; that there is a great Being that
made all Things, and that can deftroy all that he had made;
that he rewards the Good, and punifhes the Bad; that we are
to be judg'd by him at laft for all we do here: You are
not fo ignorant, but even Nature it felf will teach you
that all this is true, and I am fatisfy'd you know it all to
be true, and believe it your felf.
THA T'S true, Sir, faid Atkins; but with what Face
can I fay any thing to my Wife of all this, when lhe will
tell me immediately it cannot be true?
N o T true! faid I, What do you mean by that? Why
Sir, faid he, She will tell me it cannot be truc, that this
'  God (I flall tell her of) can be juft, or- can punifl,, or reward, fince I am not punifh'd, and fent to the Devil, that
have been fuch a wicked Creature as fhe knows I have
been, even to her, and to every Budy elfe; and that I
fhould be fuffer'd to live, that have been always a6ting fo
contrary to what I muft tell her isGood, and to what I
ought to have done,
W H y, truly, Atkins, faid I, I arh afraid thou fpeak'ft
too much Truth j and with that I let the Clergyman know
what


a



what Atkins had faid, for he was impatient to know: O!
faid the Priefi; tell him there is one Thing will make him
the beft Miniflcr in the World to his Wife, and that is,
Repentance; for none teach Repentance like true Penitents
He wants nothing but to repent, and then he will be fo
much the better qualify'd to inflru&amp;d his Wife He will be
then able to tell her, that there is not only a God, and that
he is the juft Rewarder of Good and Evil, but that he is
a merciful Being, and with infinite Goodnefs and Longfullering forbears to punifh thofe that offend; waiting to
be gracious, and willing not the Death of a Sinner, but
rather that he fiould return and live; that he oftentimes fuffers wicked Men to go on a long Time, and even referves
Damnation to the general Day of Retribution; that it is
a clear Evidence of God, and of a future State, that righteous Men receive not their Reward, or wicked Men their
Punifmient, till they come into another World; and this
W  ill lead him to teach his Wife the Do6trine of the Refurretion, and of the laft Judgment; let him but repent
for himfelf, he will be an excellent Preacher of Repentance
to his Wife.
I repeated all this to Atkins, who look'd very ferious all
the while, and who, we could eafly perceive, vas more
than ordinarily affe&amp;ted with it: When being eager, and
hardly fuffering me to make an End, I knew all this, Mafler, fays he, and a great deal more  but I han't the Impudence to talk thus to my Wife; when God, and my
own Confcience knows, and my Wife will be an undeniable Evidence againt me, that I have liv'd, as if I had never heard of a God, or a future State, or any Thing about
it; and to talk of my repenting, ALAS! (And with that
he fetch'd a deep igh; and I could fee, that Tears flood
in his Eyes;) 'Tis paft all that with me. Pafl it! A TK I N S, faid I, What doft thou mean by that? I know
well enough what I mean, Sir, fays he, I mean 'tis too
late, and that is too true.
I told my Clergyman Word for Word what he faid;
tle poor zealous Prieft (I mug call him fo, for, be his
Opinion what it will, he had certainly a moft fingular AffeCion for the Good of other Mens Souls, and it would
be hard to think he had not the like for his own;) I fay,
this zealous affetionate Man, could not refrain Tears alfo:.   But,



But, recovering himfelf, he faid to me, ask him but
one Qucftion, Is he eafy that it is too late, or is he
troubled, and wiffes it were not fo? I put the Queftion
fairly to Atkins, and he anfvrered with a great deal of Paffion, How could any Man be eafy in a Condition that certainIy muft end in eternal Deftrution? that he was far
from  being eafy, but that on the contrary, he believ'd it
would one Time or other ruin him.
W l1 A T do you mean by that? faid I, Why, he laid he
believ'd he flould, one Time or other, cut his own Throat
to put an End to the Terror of it.
T H E Clergyman fhook his Head with a great Conceln in his Face, when I told him all this: but turning
quick to me upon it, fays he, If that be his Cafe, you may
aflure him, it is not too late Chiift will give him Repentance
But pray, fays he, explain this to him, That as no Man is
fav'd but by Chrii} and the Merit of his Paflion, procuring divine Mercy for him, how can it be too late or any
Man to receive Mercy? Does he think he is able to fin
leyond the Power or Reach of Divine Mercy? Pray tell
him, there may be a Time when provok'd Mercy will no
longer h-ive, and when God may refute to hear, but that
'tis never too late for Men to ask Mercy and we that are
Chrit's Servants are commanded to preach Mercy at all
times, in the Name of Jefus Chrift, to all thofe that Jncerely repent; fo that 'tis never too late to repent.
I told Atkins all this, and he heard me with great Earnrftnefs  but it feem'd as if he turn'd off tlie Difcourfe to
the ref; for he faid to me, he would go and have fome
Talk with his Wife; fo he went out a while, and we talk'd
to the reft'  I perceiv'd they were all fupidly ignorant as
to Mlatters of Religion; much as I was when I went
rambling away from my Father, and: yet that there were
none of them backward to hei  what liad been 'fEid; and
all of them ferioufly promis'd that thy, would talk with
their Wives about,it ait  j  tbeiu  Endeavour to pex-iade,
them to turn Chriftians..i '.
THE Clergyman fmil'd upon me, when:     I reported
what Anfwer they gave, but laid nothing a good while;
but, at lafi, Ifaking his Head, We that are Chrift's Servants, fays he, can go no further than to exhort and inftrut i and when Men comply,' fubmit to the Reproof,
Iand



and promife what we ask, 'tis all we can do; we are
bound to accept their good Words: But believe me, Sir
faid he, whatever you may have known of the Life o
that Man you call William Atkins, I believe he is the only
fincere Convert among them; I take that Man to be a
true Penitent I won't defpair ot the reft, but that Man is
perfectly ftruck with the Senfe of his paft Life, and I
doubt not, but when he comes to talk Religion to his
Wife, he will talk himfelf effectually into it; for attempting to teach others, is Sometimes the beft way of teaching
our felves: I knew a Man, added he, who having nothing
but a filmmary Notion of Religion himfelf, and beingl
wicked and profligate to the laft Degree in his Life, made
a thorough Reformation in himfelf, by labouring to convert a rew; and if that poor Atkins begins but once to talk
ferioufly of Jefus Chrift to his Wife, my Life for it, he
talks himfelf into a through Convert, makes himifelf a Penitent: And who knows what may follow?
UPON this Difcourfe however, and their promifing,
as above, to endeavour to perfuade their Wives to embrace
Chriftianity, he many'd the other three Couple; but will
Atkins and his Wife were not yet come in: After this,
my Clergy man, waiting a while, was curious to know where
Atkins was gone; and, turning to me, fays he, Iintreat you,
Sir, let us walk out of your Labyrinth here, and look; I dare
fay, we fl:1al find this poor Man fomewhere or other,
talking ferioufly to his Wife, and teaching her already fometling of Religion. I began to be of the fame Mind; Ci
we went out together, and I carry'd him a Way which
none knew but my felf, and where the Trees were bf
thick fet, as that it was not eafy-to fee thro' the Thicket
of Leaves, and far harder to fee in, than tofee out; when
coming to the Edge of the Wood, I faw Atkins and his
tawny Savage Wife fitting under the Shade of a Bufh, very eager in Difcourfe; I ftop'd fhort till my Clergyman
came up to me; and then having fhow'd him where they
were, we ftood and look'd very fteadily at them a good
wahile,
W. obferv'd him  ery earneft with her, pointing up to
the Sin, and to every Quarter of the Heavens; then downi
to the Earth, then out to the Sea, then to himfelf, then to
her, to the Woods, to the Trees i Now, fays my ClergyP             man)



man, you fee my Words are made good, the Man preaches
to her i mark him, nowhe is telling her, that our God has
made him, and her, and the Heavens, the Earth, the Sea, the
Woods, the Trees, e&amp;c. I believe he is, faid I; immediately we perceiv'd Will Atkins tfart up upon his Feet, fall
down on his Knees, and lift up both his H!ands: We fuppofe he faid fbmething, but we could not hear him, it was
too far for that; he did not continue kneeling half a Minute,
lut comes and fits down again by his Wife, and talks to
her again: We perceiv'd then the Woman ve: y attentive,
hut whether lhe 'aid any thing or no we could not tell,
while the poor Fellow was upon his Knees, I could fee the
Tears run plentifully down my Clergyman's Cheeks, and I
could hardly forbear my ielf; but it was a great' Afflition
to us both, that we were not near enough to hear any
thing that pafs'd between them.
W F. L L, however, we could come no nearer for fear of
difturbing them, fo we refolv'd to fee an End of this Piece
of fill Converfation, and it fpoke loud enough to us, without the Help of Voice: He fat down again, as I have faid,
clofe by her and talk'd again earneftly to her; and twxo or
three times we could fee him embrace her paffidnately; another time we faw him take out his Handkerchief and
wipe her Eyes, and then kifs her again, with a kind of
Tranfport very unufual and after feveral of thefe Things
we fee him, on a fudden, jump up'again and lend her his
HIand to help her up, wen immediately, leading her by
the IHand a Step or two, they both kneel:d down toether,
and continu'd o about two Minutes.
M Y F iend could bear it' no longer, but cries uit aloud,
St. P A UL, St. P AtUL!behol  e ~prayeth; I was hfraid
Mtkins would hear him, therefore I 'ehtreated him  to
with-hold himfelf a whileJ that we might fee an end of
the Scene, which to me, g muft confefs, was the moft affcting, and yet the Poft agrweble that ever I law in my
Life: Well, he;frove with htimfeif, and contaii'Vd himfeilf
for a while, xbt was in fuch Raptires-of Jby, to think
that the poor Heathen Woman was become a'Ciftian, that he was'not able to contain'himtiflff he wt t feveral Times, then-throy.ing up tts Hands anU croffig -his
BreafP, faid over irveral ThingsEjaculatory and by way of
giving God Thanks for fo niracuiou a Teimo  y of the
Succefs



Succefs of our Endeavours fome he fpoke foftly, and I
could not well hear i others audably, fome in Latin, fonm
in French; then two or three times the Tears of Joy would
interrupt him, that he could not fpeak at all: But I beg'd
that he would compote himfelf, and let us more narrowly
and fully obferve what was before us, which he did for a
Time, and the Scene was not ended there yet; for after
the poor Man and his Wife were rifen again from their
Knees, we obferv'd he flood talking ftill eageily to her;
and we obferv'd by her Motion, that fhe was greatly affet6ed with what he faid, by her frequent lifting up her
Hands, laying her Hand to her Breaft, and fuch other PQ.
flures, as ufually exprefs the greateft Serioufnefs and Atten.tion: This continu'd about half a Quarter of an Hour, and
and then they walk'd away too  fo that we could fee no
more of them in that Situation.
I T o o K this Interval to talk with my Clergyman; and
firif, I told him, I was glad to fee the Particulars we hadboth been Witneffes to; that tho' I was haid enough of
Belief in fuch Cafes, yet that I began to think it was all.very fincere here, both in the Man and his Wife, however
ignorant they might both be; and I hop'd fuch a Beginning would have a yet more happy End and who knows,
faidI, but there two may in time, by Inftrufdion and Example, work upon fome of the others? Some -of them,
faid he, turning quick upon me, ay, upon all of them; depend upon it, if thofe two Savages, for he has been but
little better, as you relate it, fhould embrace Jefuil Chri/i,
they will never leave till they work upon all the reft; for
true Religion is naturally communicative, and- he that is
once made a Chriftian, will never leave a Pagan behind
him, if he can help it: I own'd it was a moft Chriftian
Principle to think fo, and a Teftimony of a true Zeal, as
well as a generous Heart in him: But, my Friend, faid I, will
you give me Leave to ftart one DifficUlty here? I cannot
tell how to obje&amp; the leaft Thing againft that affe&amp;ionate
Concern, which you fhew for the turning the poor People
from their Paganifm to the Chrifttian Religion: But how
does this comfort you, while thefe People are in your Account out of the Pale of the Catholick Church, without
which you believe there is no Salvation, fo that you effeem
F a                 theft



-thcee but Hereticks ftill, and for other Reafons as effe&amp;ually
-loft as the Pagans themfelves.
T o this he anfwer'd with abundance of Candor and
Chriffian Charity thus: Sir, I am a Catholick of the Roman Church, and a Prieft of the Order of St. Benedii, and
I embrrace all the Principles of the Roman Faith; But yet
if you will believe me, and that I do not fpeak in Compliment to you, or in refpefi to my Circumflances andyour Ci'lities; I fay, neverthelefs, I do not look upon you, who
call your fclves reform'd, without fome Charity: I dare
not fay, tho' I know it is our Opin;on in general; I fay, I
dale not fay that you cannot be a v'd: I will by no means
limit the Mercy of Chrift fo far, as to think that he cannot receive you into the Bofom of his Church, in a manner to us unperceivatle, and which it is impoflible for us
to know; and I hope you have the fame Cha ity for us; I
pray daily for your being all reftor'd to Chrift's Church, by
whatfocver Methods he, who is All-wife, is plcas'd to direct: In the mean.time, fure you will allow it to confut
with me, as a Roma, to diftinguifh far between a Proteflant and a Pagan; between one that calls Gn Jefus Chrilt,
tho' in a Way which I do not think is according to the
true Faith: and a Savage, a Barbarian, that knows noGod,
nro Chrift, no Redeemer at all; and if you. are not within.the Pale of the Catholick Church, &lt;we hope you. are nearer
being reflor'd to it, than thoe that know nothing at all, of
God or his Church: I rejoice therefore when I fee this
poor Man, who you fay has been a Profligate, and almoft
a Murtherer, kneel down and pray to Jefus Chrift, as we
fuppofe he did, tho' not fully enlighten'di believing that
Cod, fiom whom every fuch Work proceeds, will fenfibly
touch his Heart, and bring him to the further Knowledge
of the Ti uth in his own Time; and if God fsall influence
this poor Man to convert and inftruf the ignorant Savage
his Wife, I can never believe that he fball be caft away
himfetif; and have I not Reafon then to rejoice, the nearer"
anrmy ai eb ought tothe Knowledge of Chrift, tho' they may
not be bi ought quite home into the Bofom of the Catholick Church, juff atthe Time when I may defire it? leaving
it to the Goodnefs of Chrift to perfec  his Work in his
own Time, and his own Way: Certainly I would rejoice
if all the Savages in 4nerica were brought like this poor
Woman,



Woman to pray to God, tho' they were to be all Profeftants at firft, rather than they hlould continue Pagans and
I-eathens; firmly believing, that he who had beftowv'd that
firft Light upon them, would further illuminate them with
a Beani of his heavenly Grace, and. bring them  into the
Pale of his Church when he flould fee good.
I WAS aftonifhld at the Sincerity and Temper of this truly pious Papift, as much as I was opprefs'd by the Power
of his Reafoning, and it prefently occur'd'to my Thoughts,
that if fuch a Temper was univerfal, we might be al1 C. â
tholick Chriflians, whatever Church or particular Profetf
fion we join'd to, or join'd in; that a- Spirit of Charity
would foon work us all up into right Principles; and, in a
Word, as he thought that the like Charity would make us
all Catholicks fo I told him  I believ'd, had all the Members of his Church the like Moderation, they would foon
be all Proteftants; And there we left that Part, for wi
never difputed at all.
However, I talk'd to him another way, and taking hit
by the Htand, my Friend, fays I, I wilh all the Clergy of
the Roman Church were bleft with ifch Moderation, aod
an equal Share of your Charity  I am enti:ely of your
Opinion but I muft tell you, that if you fhould preach
fuch Do&amp;rine in Spain, or Ity, they would put you into
the Inqufition.
I T may be fo, faid he, I know  not what they might
do in Spain and Italy, but I will not fay they would he
the better Chriftians for that Severity, for I am fure there
is no Herefy in too much Charity.
Well, as Will Atkins and his Wife were gone, our Bufknefs there was over: fo we went back our own )Tay and
when we came back, we found them waiting to be cali'd
in: Obferving this, I ask'd my Clergyman if we flcuIld
difcover to him that we had Leen him  under the Bufni,
or no; and it was his Opinion we fhould not  but that
we fhould talk to him firit, and hear what he would lay
to us; fo we call d him in alone, no Body being in the
Place but our felves, and I began with him thus:
X0tl Atkins, faid I; prithee what Education had you?
What was your Father?


F j,


tW. A



W  A4. A better Man than ever I fhall be.  Sir, my Father was a Clerrman.
R. C. What Education did he give you?
W. A. He would have taught me well, Sir; but I defpis'd all Education, Infiruftion, or Corre6ion, like a Beaft
as I was.
R. C. It's true, Solomon fays, he that defpifei Reproof i;
rutiJfh.
W. A. Ay, Sir, I was brutifh, indeed, I murther'd my
Father; for God's fake, Sir, talk no mote about that, SiA
I murther'd my poor Father.
iJr. Ha! a Mutherer! *
* Here the Prief flarted (for I interpreted every Word
as he fpoke it) and ook'd pal; It feems he believ'
that Will had really kill'd his own  ather.
R. C. No, no, Sir, I do not underftand him fo; WiU
4ltkins, explain your felf, you did not kill your Father, did
you, with your own HIands?
W. A. No, Sir, I did not cut his Throat; but I cut
the Thread of all his Comforts, and lhorten'd his Days; I
broke his Heart by the mofd ungrateful unnatural Rerurrr,
for the moft tender affetionate Treatment that ever Father
gave, or Child could receive.
R. C. 'Well,. I did not ask you about your Father to
extort this Confeffion; I pray God give you Repentance
for it, and forgive you that, and all your other Sins but I
ask'd you, Ltecaufe I fee, that tho' you have not much
Learning, yet you are not ~o ignorant as fome are, in Things
that are good; that you have known more of Religion a
g ieat deal than you have prafifed.
7. A. Tho' you, Sir, did not extort the Confefifor
that I make about my Father, Confcience does r and when
ever we come to look back upon our Lives, the Sins againff our indulgent Parents are certainly the firfi that
touches us; the Wounds they make lie dcepeff, and the
Weight they leave will lie heavieft upon the Mind, of all
the Sins we can commit.
R. C. You talk too felingly and fnfibly for me Atkim s
I cannot bear it..
W.A 4



W. A. You bear it, Mafler I dare fay you know notiing of it.
R. C. Ycs, Atkins, every Shore, every Hill, nay, I may
fay, every Ti ee in this Iiland is witnefs to the Anguifh of
my Soul, for my Ingratitude and bafe Uiage ofa good
tender Father; a Father much like yours, by your Deicription; and I murther'd my Father as well as you, Will Atkins; but think, for all that, my Repentance is fhort of
yours too * by a great deal.
*I mould have aid more, if I could have reflrain'd
my P'affwns; but I thought this poor Man's Repentance was fj much fmcerer than mine, that I was going to kave off the Difourfe and'retire, for I was
farpria'd twit wat he faid and thought, that inftea
of my gg oin ab   to teach 'ac  i;nflrui hii, the Mua
wa, made a Teacher and Inftrudor to me, in a mofb
furprizing and unexpeded manner.
I lid all this before the young Clergyman, who was
reatly affted with it, and aid to me, Did I not fay, Sir,
that whenthis Man was converted, he would preach to uS
all I tell you, Sir, if this one Man be made a true Penitent, here will be no need of me he will make ChrifRians
of all in the Ifland: But having a little compqs'd my felf,
I renew'd my Difcourfe with Will 4tkins.
But WtI L, faid I, How comes th Senfe of this Matter to touch you juft now?
7 4.    Sir, you have Iet me about a Work that has
ftruck a Dart thro' my very Soul; I have been talking about God and Religion to my Wife, in order, as you direced me, to make a Chriftian of her, and lhe haspreach'd
fuch a Sermon to me, as I fliall never forgt while I
live.
R. C. No, no, it is not your Wife has preachd to you;. but when you were moving religious Arguments to her,
Confcience has flung them back upon you.
A. W. Ay, Sir, with fucdh a Force as is not to be refifted.
R. C. Pray W/I, let us know   what pafs'd betweenyou and your Wife, for I know     fomething of it already.
F 4                 W..



IV. A. Sir, it is impoffible to give you a fLll Accotmt
of it I tam too full to hold it, and yet have no Tongue
to exprefs it; but let her have.faid what fle will, and tho'
I cannot give you an Account of it, this I can tell you of
it, that I refolve to amend and reform my Life.
R. C. But tell us rome of it. How   did you begin
Will? For this has been an extraordinary Cafe, that's certain; fie has preach'd a Sermon, indeed, if lhe has
wrought this upon you.
W. A. Why, I f'rft told her the Nature of our Laws
about Marriage, and what the Reafons were, that Men
-and Women were oblig'd to enter into fich Compaas, aa
it was neither in the Power of one or other to break;
that otherwife, Oider and Juftice could not be maintain'd,
And Men would run from their Wives, and abandon their
'Children, mix confufedly with one another, and neither
Families be kept entire, or Inheritances be fettled by legal
Defcent.
R. C. You talk like a Civilian, Will; could you make
her underfland what you meant by, Inheritance and Faillies? they know no fuch thing' among the Savages, but
marry any how, without Regard to Relation, CQnfangui.
nity, or Family; Brother and Sifter; nay, as I have been
told, even the Father and Daughter, and the Son and the Mother.
W. A. I believe, Sir, you are mifinform'd, and my
Wife aflures me of the contrary, and that they abhor it j
reihaps, for any farther Relations, they may not be fo ex.
't&amp; as we arei but fle tells me they never touch one another in the near Relations you fpeak of.
R. C. Well,, what did fhe fiy,. to what you told
I;er.
W. A. She fid, the lik'dit very well, and. it was much
better than in her Country.
R. C. But did you tell her what Marriage was?
W. A. Ay, ay, there began all our Dialogue, I ask'd
her if fhe would be marryd to me our Way? She ask'd
'me what Way that was? I told her, Marriage was appointed of God; and here we had a fTrange Talk together,
kAled, as ever    ad Wife!  d, I believe..
$. B.



N. B. This Dialogue between W. Atkins and hiS
Wife, as I took it down in Writing, juf after he told
it me, was as follows.
Wife. Appointed by your God! why have you a God in,
your Country?
W. A. Yes, my Dear, God is in every Country.
Wife. No, your God in my Country3 my Country
have the great old Benamuckee God.
W  A. Child, I am very unfit to ihew you who Godl
is; God is in Heaven, and made thlcHeavenand the Earth,
the Sea, and all that in them is.
Wife. No makee de Earth    no, you God makee de
Earth, no make my Country. *
* W. A. laugh'd a little at her Expre.fon of Goal ant
making her Country.
Wife. No laugh, why laugh me Z This no Thing to
lughl. t
t, He was Jsfuly reprovd by his Wife, for ]fei was ' More
ferious than he at firft.
W. A. That's true indeed, I wil not laugh any mnor
my Dear.
W.fe. Why you fay, you God make al?
W. A. Yes, Child, our God made the whole \World,
and you, and I, and all Thingsj for he is the only true
God, there is no God but him, he lives for ever in Heaven.
tife. Why you no tell me long go?
W. A. That s true indeed, but I have been a wicked
Wretch, and have not only forgotten to acql;aint thee with
any Thing before, but have lived without God in the
World my felf. -
Wife. What have you de great God in you Country.
you no kno''him.? No fay O to him? No d(     gxoo
Thing for him? That no impoilble!
W. 4. It is too true tho, for all that, we live a: if
F           $          there



there was no God in Heaven, or that he ldWno Power
on Earth?
Wife. But why, God let you do fo? Why he no makee you gcod live?
W. A. It is all our own Fault.
Wfe. But you fay me, he.is Great, much, Great, havemuch great Power; can makee kill when he will 5.why'
he nb makee kill when you no ferve him.o No fay O to
him? No be good Mans?
W[  A. That is true; he might ftrike me Dead, and I;.
ought to expe&amp;t it, for I have been a wicked Wretch, that
is true; but God is merciful, and does not deal with us as$
we deferve.
Wife. But then, do no you tell God Tankee for that
too?
W. A, No, indeed, I have ndt thank'd God for hi
Mer cy, any more than I have fear'd God for his Power.
Wife. Then you God no Godi me no think, believe,
he be fuch one, great much Power, Strong; no makee kiTl
you tho' you makee him much Angry?
tP A.   What.? Will my wicked Life hinder you from
believing in God! What a dreadful Creature am I! And,
what a fad Truth is it, that the horrid Lives of Chriftians
hinders the Converfions of Heathens?
Wife.. How me tink you have great much God t up
there, and yet no do well, no do good Ting? Can ha
i1? Sure he no tell what you do?
-t Sbe points qP to Heaven.
W   4. Yes, yes) he knows and fees all Things; he
ears us fpcak, fees what we do, knows what we think,
tho' we do not fFeak..
Wife. What! he no hear you fwear, curfe, fpeak the
great Damn?
W. A. Yes, yes, he hears it all,
i4fe. Where be then the muchee great Power ftrong?
WA., He is merciful, that's all we can fay for it;
and this proves h'm to le the tr ue God; he is God and
not la; i and tbe1ifore we are not, confuned. *





* IHere Will. Atkins told us he was flruck with Horror,
to think how be coud tell his Wife fo clearly, that
God fees, and hears, and knows the ficret Thoughts
of the Heart, and all that we do; and yet that he
had dar'd to do all the 'vile Things he had done"
Wife. Merciful! What you call dat?
w. A. He is our Father and Maker, and he pities and
fpares us.
Wife. So then he never makee kill, never angry when
you do wicked   then he no good himfelf, or no great
able.
W  A.   Tes, yes, myl Dear, he is infinitely good, and
infinitely great, and able to punilh too; and fometimes to
filew his Jufhice and Vengeance, he lets fly his Anger to
deftroy Sinners, anid make Examples many are cut off in
their Sins.
Wife. But no makee kill you yet, than he tell you may
be that he no make you kill, fo you make de Bargain with
him, you do bad Thing, he no be angry at you, when he
be angry at other Mans?
W... No indeed, my Sins are all Prefumptions upon
his Goodnefs; and he would be infinitely juft if he defroy'd me as he has done other Men,
Wep. Well, and yet no kill, no makee you dead, what
you fay to him for that, you no tell him Tankee for all
that too?,E. A.I am an unthankful, ungrateful Dog, that's
true.
Wife. Why he no makee you much good better, you
fEy he makee you.
W. A.   He made me as he made all the World; 'tis
i have deform'd my felT, and abus'd his Goodnefs, and
havo made my felf an abominable Wretch.
Wife. I wiffi you makee God know me, I no makee
him angry, 1 no do bad wicked Thing.
Here Will. Atkins faid his Heart funk within him, to
hear a poor untaught Ceatreature ere to be tauht to
know God, and he fuch a wicked Wretch, that he
could not fay one Word to her about God, but what

TWif. Bid you pray? When he bid you? How he bid

W. A. No, we do not hear him fpeak, but he has reeal'd himfelf many Ways to us.
Here he was at a great Lofs to make her underflan,
that God has reveal'd himfelf to us by his WorAd
and. what his Word was: But at lafi he told it her.
thus.
W. A. God has fpoken to fome good Men in former
Days, even from Heaven, by plain Words; and God has
infpir'd good Men by his Spirit; and they have written all
his Laws down in a Book.
lV'fe. Me no underhfand that, where is Book?
W. A. Alas! my poor Creature, Ihave not this Book;
but I hope I fhall one Time or other get it for you to
read it.
Here kh embrac'd her with great AfSion- but with,
inextrefible Grief, that he had not a Bibe.
Wife. But how you makee me know, that God teachee
them to wiitethat Book
W. A. By the fame Rule that, we know   him to,be
God.
Wife. What Rule, what Way you know?
W. A. Becauiz he teaches. and commands nothing but
what is good, r'hteous, and holy; and tends to make
us perfe&amp;tly good, as well as perfe6tly happy; and becaufe he forbids aid commands us to avoid, all that is
wicked, that is Evil in it ielf, or Evil in its Conftquences.
Wifre. That me vwould undertand, that me fain fee;
if he teachee all gooc Thing, forbid all wicked Thing,
he reward all good Thing, punifi all wicked Thing,
he make all Thing, he give all. Thing, he hear me when

ve, when I.no be good all this you fay he doi yes he!i.:



be great God i me take, think, believe him be great GoCd
me fay 0 to him too with you, my Dear.
H E R E the poor Man,faid he, could forbear no longer; but
raifing her up, made her kneel by him, and he pray'd to
God, aloud, to inftrult her in the Knowledge of himfclf
by his Spirit, and that by fome good Providence, if poffible, fhe might obmetime or other come to have a Bible,
that fhe might read the Word of God, and be taught by
it to know him.
T H   s was the Time that we iaw    him lift her up
by the Hand,' and faw   him  kneel down by her, as
above.
T HEY had feveral other Difeourfes it feems after this,
too long to fet down here; and particularly the made himn
promife, that fince he confefs'd his own Life had been a
wicked abominable Courfe of Provocation againft  God,
that he would reforn it, and not make God angry any
more, left he flould male7 him  dead, as fle ca'd it, and
then fite fhould be left alone, and never be taught to know
this God better; and left he flould be mife:able, as he had
told her wicked Men flould be after Death..
T   I was a ftrange Account, and very afehing to us
both, but particularly to the young Clergyman; e was
indeed wonderfully furpriz'd with it, but under the greateft Affliftion imaginable that he could not tk to her, that
he could not fpeak Englifh to make her Oderftand him;
and as fle fpoke but vey broken Engkflh, Ye could not underifand her: However he turn'd himfelf to me, and told
me, that he believ'd there muft be moitto do with this
Woman than to marry her: I did not anderftand him at
firft, but at length he explain'd himfdf,.(viz.) that fhe
ought to be Baptiz'd.
I AGR EED with him in that Part readily, and was for
oing about it prefently: No, no, Ijld Sir, fid he, tho"
I would have her be baptiz'd by ai Means, yet I mufi
obferve, that Will..tkins, her Huslind, has indeed brought
s.r in a wonderful Manner to be tilling to embrace a rcligious Life, and has given her jUt Ideas of the Being of
a God, of his Power, Juftice, Mercy  yet I deire to
know' of him, if he had faid iny Thing to her of Jefs
Cjril, and of the Salvation of Sinners, of the Nature of
-.                    Faith



Faith in him, and Redemption by him; of the Holy Spirit, the Refurredtion, the laft Judgdment, and a future
State.
I CAL L'D Will. Atkins again, and ask'd him; but the
poor Fellow fell immediately into Tears,. and told us he
had faid Something to her of all thofe Things, but that
he was himfelf fo: wicked a Creature, and his own Confaience io reproach'd him with his horrid ungodly Life,
that he trembled at the Apprehenfions, that her Knowledge of him, fhould lefTen the Attention the ihould give

than receive it: But he was affur'd he faid that her Min&amp;
was fo difpos'd to receive due Impreffions of all thofe
Things, that if I would but difcourfe with her fhe would
make it appear to my Satisfaction, that my Labour would'
not be lof upon her.,
ACCORDINGLY I call'd her inh and placing my felf
as Interpreter between my religious Prieft and the Woman,
I entreated him to begin with her; but fure fuch a Sermon was never preach'd by a Popifh Prieff in there latter
Ages of the World i. and, as, I told him, I thought he had
all the Zeal, all the Knowledge, all the Sincerity of a
Chriftian, without the Errors of a Roman Catholick  and
that I took him to be fuch a Clergyman, as the Roman
Bifhops were, before the Church of Rome affum'd fpiritual Sovereignty over the Confciences of Men:
I N a Word, he brought the poor Woman to embrace
the Knowledge of Chrift, and of Redemption.by him,*
not with Wonder and Aftonifhment only, as the did thefirft Notions of a God, but with Joy and Faith,. with
an AffeiHon and a furprifing Degree of Underftanding,
fcarce to be imagin'd, much lefs to be exprefsd; and at
her own- Requeft fhe was baptiz'd.
W H EN he was. preparing to taptize her, I entreated:
him that he would perform that Office with fome Caution, that the Man might not perceive he was of the Roman
Church, if poffible;. ecaufe of other ill Confequences which
might attend a Difference among us in that very Religion,.
which we were infftruting the other in: He told me, that
as he had no confecrated Chappel, no proper Things for
the Office, I fhould fee he would do it in a Manner, that I'
Iould: not know by it, that he was a Raman Catholick
my



y'felf, if I had not known it before: And fbohe did
for faying only fome Words over to himfelf in Latin,
which I could not underftand, he pour'd a whole Dilhfui
of Water'upon the Woman's Head, pronouncing in French,
very lofd, MARY, which was the Name, her H1Iufand
deir'd me to give her; for I was her Godfather, I baptize
theecin the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the
Holy Ghoft j fo that none could know any Thing by it,
what Religion he was of: He gave the Benedicion afterwards in Latini but either Will. Atkin did not know but,
it was in French, or elfe did not take Noticej of it, at
that Time.                  -
As. obon as this was over we marry'd them; and after
the Marriage was over, he turn'd himfelf to Will. Atkins,
atrd in a very affetionate. Manner exhorted him, not only to perfevere in that good Difpofition he was in, but to
iupport the Convi&amp;ions that were upon him by a Refola-.tion t oreform his Life; told him, it was in vain to fay
he repented, if h did not forlake his Crimes: Reprefent(
ed to hid, how  God had hnourd him with being the
Inffrument of bringing his Wife to the Knowledge of tie
Chriffian Religion, and that he ihould be caretul he did
not diffonour the Grace of God, and that if he did, he
would fee the Heathen a better Chriftian than himfelf; the
Savage converted, and the Intra.nent caft away.
H E faid a great many good Things to them both, an4
then recommended them i n a fe  Word&amp; to God's GoodneTs, gave them tl Benedi&amp;ion again, I repeating every
Thing to them in tngiijb, and thus ended th  eremony:
I think it was the mnof plefaint agreeable Day to me that
ever I paffd inf my whole Life.
B u V my Clergyman had not done yet; his Thoughts
hung continually upon the Converfion of- the- fen and
thirty Savages, and fain he would have ftay'd.upon the
Ifland to have undertaken it  but I cninc'd him, firI,
that his Undertaking was impra:icable in it felf:  and  -
crmdly, that perhaps I would ru itfnto a Wy of being

fitively in fuchl a Cafe, I verily believe, was a true finer
Penitent.
HE tivided Things fo juftly, and fo much to every
one's Satisfaftion, that they only defired one general Writing under my Hand for the Whole, which I caufed to be
drawn up, and figned and fealed to them, fetting out the
Bounds and Situation of every Man's Plantation, and teftitying, that I gave them thereby, feverally a Right to the
whole Poffefion and Inheritance of the refpedive Plantations or Farms, with their Improvements, to them and
their Heirs, ref.rving all the red of the Ifland as my own
Property, and a certain Rent for every particular Plantation
after eleven Years, if I, or any one from me, or in my
Name, came to demand it, producing an attefted Copy of
the fime Writing.
As to the Government and Laws among them, I told
them I was not capable of giving them better Rules, than
they were able to give themrlves; only made them promife -me to live in Love and good Neighbourhood with
one another and fo I prepared to leave them.
O N   Thing I muff not omit, and this is, that being
now fettled in a kind of Common-wealth among themfelves, and having much Bufinefs in Hand, it was but odd
to have feven and thirty Indians live in a Nook of the
Ifland, independent, and indeed unemploy'd; for exceptA
ing the providing themfelves Food, which they had Dif
ficulty enou hk in too, fometimes, they had no manner of
Bufinefs or Property to manage: I propos'd' therefore to
the Governour Spaniard, that ie iliould go to them with
Friday's Father, and propofe to them to remove, and either plant for themfelves, or take them into their feveral
Families as Servants to be mamitain'd for their Labour, but
without being abfolute Slaves, for I would not admit
them to make them Slaves by For-ce, by any Means, becaufe they had their Liberty given by Capitulation, and as
it were Articles of Surrender, which they ought not to
break.
THEY moft willingly embrac'd the Propofal, and came
all very chearfully along with him; fo we allotted thelem
Land, and -Plantations, which three or four accepted of,
but l the reft chofe to be employ'd as Servants in the feversa



veraIFFamiees we had fettled; and thus my Colony wes
in a Manner fettled, as follows; The Spaniards pofiefs d
my original Habitation, which was the Capital City, and
extended their Plantations all along the Side of the Brook,
which made the Creek that I have io often defcrib'd, as
far as my Bower; and as they encreas'd their Culture
it went always Eafiward; the Engljh liv'd in the
North-Eaft Part, where Will. Atkins and his Comrades began, and came on Southward, and South-Weft, towards
the back Part of the Spaniards, and every Plantation had,
a great Addition of Land to take in, if they found Occafion, fo that they need not joffle one another for want of
Room.
ALL the Weft End of the Ifland was left uninhabited,
that if any of the Savages fliould come on Shore there;
only for their ufual cuftomrry Barbarities, they might
come and go; if they diffurb'd no Body, no- Body
would diifurb them; and'no doubt but they were often
aihore, and went away again 5 for I never heard that the
Planters were ever attack'd or difturb'd any more.
It now came intomy. Thoughts, that I had hinted to my
'Friend the Clergyman, that the Work oft converting the
Savages, might perhaps be fet on foot in his Abfence, to.
his Satisfa6Con; and I told him, that now I thought it
was put in a fair Way; for the Savages being thus dvided
among the Cifftians, if they would but every one of
them do their Part with thofe which came under their
Hands, I hop' itt g     have a very good Efe&amp;t.
H E agreed prefently in that,. If, fad he, they will do,
their Part but how, fays he, fhaU we obtain that of them?
I told him, we would call them all together, and leave it
in Charge with them, oi go to them       one by one, which
he thought beft, fo we divided it; he to fpeak to the Spawards, who were all apfis and I to the Engliflr, who
were all PrFoeflant; and we recommended it earnefily to
them, and made them   promife, that they never would'
make any Diffinftion of Papfl or Proteflant,in their exhorting the Savages to turn Chriffians; but teach them  the
general Knowledge of the true God; and of their Saviour Jefus Chrift, and they likewife promis'd us, that they
would never have any Differences or Difputes one withanother, about Religion.

W H E N I came to W. Atkins's Houfe, (I may call itl-o,
for fuch.a Houfe or filch a piece of Basket-Work, I believe,
was not rtaiding in the VWolld again ) I ay, when I came
*there, I found the young Woman I have mention'd above, and W  Atkins's Wifie, were become Intimates; and.this prudtent religious young Woman, had pcrfeced the
Work i.  Atkins had.begun; and tho' it was not al:ove
'four Days after what I have related, yet the new baptiz'd
Savage Wroman was made fuch a Chrihian, as I have feldom heaid of any like her, in all my Oblervation, or Converfation in the World.
IT came next into my Mind in the Morning before I went
to them, that amongif all the needful Things I had to leave
with them, I had not left a Bible, in which, I frew'd my
felf lefs confidering for them, than my good Friend the
Widow was for me, when 'he fent me the Cargo of an
hundred Pounds from  Lisbon, where fl.e pack'd up three
Bibles and a Prayer-Book: However, the good Woman's
Charity had a greate  Extent than ever fle imagin'd
for they were referv'd for the Comfort and Inftu6tion
of thofe, that made much better Ufe of them than I had
done.
I T o K one of the Bibles in my Pocket, and when I
came to Will Atkins's Tent or Ioufe, and found the young
Woman, and Atkins's haptiz'd Wife, had been difcourfing
of Religion together; for Will Atkin toldme, with a great
deal of oy: I ask'd if they were together now, and he
Said, Yes; fo I went intq the HoufC, and he, with me,
and we found them together very earneft in Difcourfe;
O Sir, fays Will. Atkins, when God has Sinners to reconcile to himfelf, and Aliens to bring Home, He never wants
a Meffenger; my Wife has got a new Infnru6tor; I knew
J was unworthy, as I was uncapable of that Work, that
young Woman has been fent hither from  Heaven; efl is
enough to convert a whole Ifland of Savages, the young
Woman blufh'd, and rofe up to go away, but I defired her to fit.till;  I told, her, The had a  ood
Work upon her    ands, and I hop'd God would ble;her in it.
W   talk'd alittle, and I did not perceive they had any Book
among them, though I did not ask; but I put my Handin
amy Pocket, and pulld out my Bible here, ays I, to Atkins,

I have brought you an Affiftant that perhaps you had not before; the Man was fo confounded, that he was not able to
fpeak for fome Time; but recoveringhimfelf, he takes it with
bothhis Hands, and turningto his Wife, here, my Dear, fays
he did not I tell you, our God, tho' He lives above, could
hear what we laid? Here's the Book I pray'd for, when
you and I kneel'd down under the Bufl;  now God has
heard us, and fent it; when he had faid fo, the Man fell
into fuch Tranfports of a paffionate Joy, that between the
Joy of having it and giving God Thanks for it, the Tears
run down his Face like a Child that was Crying.
T HE Woman was furprifed, and was like to have run
into a Miffake, that none of us were aware of; for lhe
firmly bcliev'd God had fent the Book upon her Husband's
Petition; It is true, that providentially it was fo, aad might
be taken fo in a confequent Senfe; but I believ'd, it would
lave been no difficult Matter at that Time to have perfuaded the poor Woman to have believ'd, that an exprefs
Meffenger came from  Heaven, on purpofe to bring that
individual Book; but it was too ferious a Matter, to fuiffer
any Delufion to take Place; fo I turn'd to the young Woman and told her, we did not delire to impofe upon the
new Convert,-in her filft, and more ignorant underftand-.ing of Thintgs; nd be' her to explain to her, that God
may be very pyropely id to anfwer our Petitions, when
in the Courfe ofhis Providence, fuch Things are in a particular Manner brought-to pai, as we petition'd for; but
we do not expet rettrns from Heaven, in a miraculous
and particular Manner, 'id thatit is our Mercy, that it is
not. f
'Trr s fihe  ung EWoian did afterwards effe'cually;
fo that thre was,  affure you, no 'Prietcraft ufed here;
and I fhould have tought it one of the  toft mjuftifiable
Frauds in the World, to have had it fo; but the Surprife
of Joy upon W4l1. Aikit, is really not to be exprefled,;
'and there we may be fure, there was no Delfion: Sure,
no Man was ever more thankful in the World'for any
Thing'of its Kind, than he was'for this Bible; nor I believe, never any Man was glad of a Bible from a better
-rinciple; and though he had een a moftprofigae Creature,
perate, headfrong, outragious, furious, and wicked to a
'great Degrte; iythis Man is a ftanding -Rule to us all
for



for the well inftruting Children, (viz.) that Parents fhould
never give over to teach and inftru&amp;, or ever defpair of
the Succefs of their Endeavours, let the Children be ever fo
obftinate, refra&amp;tory, or to Appearance, infenfible of inftru&amp;tion; for if ever God in his Providence, touches the Confcicnces of fuch, the Force of their Education returns upon them, and the early Inftru&amp;ion of Parents is not loft
though it may have been many Years laid afleep; but fome
Time or other, they may find the Benefit of it.
T ii U s it was with this poor Man; However ignorant
he was, or diveRted of Religion and Chriftian Knowledge:
lie found he had fome to do with now, more ignorant
than himfelf; and that the leaf Part of the Inftrudion of
his good Father that could now come to his Mind, was
of Ufc to him.
A M o N G the reft it occurr'd to him, he faid, how his
Father us'd to infift much upon the inexpreffible Value of
th~ Bible; the Privilege and Blefling of it to Nations, Families, and Perfons; blut he never entertain'd the leaft Notion of the Worth of it, till now; when being to talk to
Heathens, Savages, and Barbarians, he wanted the Help of
the written Oracle for his Affiftance.
T H E young Woman was very glad of it alfo for the
prefent Occafion, tho' The had one, and fo had the Youth
on board our Ship among their Goods, which were not
yet brought on Shore; and now having Laid fo many
Things of this young Woman, I cannot 'omit of telling
one Story more of her, ind my felf, which has fomething
in it very informing and remarkable.
I have related, to what Extremity the poor young Woman was reduced; how her Mifttee  was flatv'd to D)eath,
and did die on board that unhappy Ship we met at Sea,
and how the whole Ship's Company being reduc'd to the
laft Extremity; the Gentlewoman, and her Son, and this
Maid, were firft hardly ufed, ^t to Provifidos; and atolaft
'totally negl6ted arid ftarv'd ':hat 1stto fay, brought to the
laft Extireity of Hunger.        i.ghto
O   t E Day bein  Dicourfing *ikitIe&amp;!b.n the 'tremities they fiifferd, I ask'd her if' he oik d defcribeby
what fhe had felt,       wg'hat it'was to'f trvee, ah dhowit appear'd; fhe told me, fhe believ'd flie could; and fhe told
er Tale very diftintly thus:
" FIRST,



" FI ST,j Sir, faid fte, we had for fome Days far'd
c" exceeding hard, and fuffer'd very.great Hungeri but
" now at laf, we were wholly without Food of any Kind,
" -except Sugar, and a little Wine, and a little Water, The
firt Day, after I had receiv'd no Food at all, I found
" my felf towards Evening, firft empty and fickifh at my
Stomach, and nearer Night mightily neclin'd to yawn"ing.and fleepy; I laid down on a Couch in the great
9c Cabin to fleep, and flept about three Hours, and awak'd
' a little refreih'd; laving taken a Glafs of Wine when I
" lay down; after being about three Hours awake, it be" ing about five a-Clock in the Morning, I found my felf
" empty and my Stomachfickifh agai,and lay'd down again,
" but could not fleep at all, being very faint, and ill and
"thus I continu'd all the lecond Day, with a ftrange Va' riety, firfiHungry, then iick again, with Reachings to
* vomit; the iecond Night being oblig'd to go to Bed a" gain, without any Food, more than a Draught of fair
Water; and being afleep, I dream'd I was at Barbadoes,
"and that the Market was mightily fock'd with Proviii" ons; that I brought fome fr my Miftres, and went
"and din'd very heartily.
" I T Ho uo  T my Stomach was as full after this, as
" it wold have been after, or ataa good Dinner; but
when I awak'd, I was exceedingly iunk in my Spirits,
"' to find my fif in the extremity of Famine: The laft
" Glfs of Wine we had,    drank, and put Sugr in it,
" becaufe of its having Ibme Spirit to fupplytourifh"ment; but therebeingn Subftancein the Stomach for the
digefting Office to w  k upon, I found the only effet
of th      ie was, to raife diagrceable Funes from the
&lt;" Stomach, into the: Head 3 and I lay, as they told me,
f' upid, and eas leIf, as One Drunk for fome Time. &gt;
"    TJ E third Day in the: Morning, after a Night of
' ftraqge apd confus4 inconfiftent Darcms; and rather

"T H I S lafed about thee Hours; 'during which Time
" I was twice raging Mad as any Creature in Bedlar, as
( my young Mafter told me, and as he can now inform
" you.
" I N one of thefe Fits of Lunacy or Diltradion, whe"ther by the Motion of the Ship, or fome Slip of my
"Foot, I know not; I fell down, and fruck my Face
" againf the Corner of a Palat Bed in which my Miftrefs
"     lay; and with the Blow the Blood gulh'd out of my
" Nofe; and the Cabin Boy bringing mle a little Bafon, I
"fat down and bled into it agreat deal; and as the Blood
"run from me, I came to my fellf and the Violence of
c the Flame, or the Fever, I was in abated, and fo did
"the ravenous Part of the Hunger.
'; THEN I grew tick, and reach'd to Vomit, but could
"not    for I Iad nothing in my Stomach to bring up:
",After I had bled fome  ime, I fwoon'd, and they all
" believ'd I was dead; but I came to my fflf foon af"ter, and then had a mpft dreadful Pain in my Sto
mach,I not to be defcrib'd  not like the Cholic, but a
" gnawing eagr Pain for Food   'and towardi Night it
"went oft with a kind of earneft Withing or Longing

"of a Woman with Child: I took' another Draught of

"I T was this dreadful Condition we were in when you

"Sir, you know as well as I, and better too.
T H I S was her own Relation, and is fuch a diftind Account of ftarving to Death, as I confefi I never met with,
and was exceeding entertaining to me; I am the rather
apt to believe it to be a true Account, be cauf the Youth
gave me an Account of a good Part of it, though I muft
own, not fo diftin&amp; and io feelingly asshis Maid and the
rather, becaufe it fems his Mother fed him, at the Price
of her own Life: But the poor Maids tho' her Cotitution being ftroger than that of herriflr f, who was in
Years, and a weakly Woman too, fe might ftruggle
harder with it; I fy, the poor Mai, might be fuppos'd
to feel the Extremity foimthing ioo(er than her Miftrefs,
who might be allowed to keep the laft Bits fomething
longer than fbe partecd withany to rieve the Maid. No
Queffion, as the Ca is  rerelated, if our Sip orr ome

more would Ohave endd all:teir:ieS, ulle w   they had

Cafe ltood, would  ce ~erv'd them but a ittle while, they
bethg -oo Leagues frm any Land  or any Poflibility of
Relief, other than in the miraculous Manner it happen'd:
But this is by the Way; I return tto my Diipoition of
Things among thePeople.
A A N,.Fr   It is to be fiervI her  That fr many
Reafons I did to:- think fit to let themnrw any Thing.,
of th,Slop Ilid frnda' and which I thought of fteting
up among them   for!D found, atfleUfi,  myfirft w
fuchSeeds of Diviflioe among them, that if lw it plainly, had I I  up tbe Sloop, and left it among them, they
G a                      would



would upon every light Diiguft have feperated, and gone
away from one another, or perhaps have turn'd Pirates,
and 0b made the Ifland a Den of Thieves, infiead of a
Plantation of fober and religious.People, as I intended it
to be; nor did I leave the two Pieces of Brafs Cannon that I
had on Board, or the two Quarter-Deck Guns, that my
Nephew took extraordinary, for the fame Rcafbn:. I thought
they had enough to qualify them for a defienfive War againft any that fhould invade them j but I was not to fet
them up for an oftenfive War, or to encourage them to
go Abroad to attaque others, which in the End would only bring Ruin and Deftrution upon themfelves and all their
Undertakings: Ireferv'd the Sloop therefore, and the Guns,
for their Service another Way, as I fhall obferve in its
Place.
I  A v t now done with the Ifland: I left them all in
good Circumflances, and in a flourifl ing Condition, and
went on board my Ship again the    lDay of
having been five and twenty Days among them; and
'as they were all refol'd to ftay upon the Ifland 'till I
came to remove them, I promised to fend fame further
Relief from the Brf, if I could poffibly find an-Opportunity  and particularly I promis'd to fend them fome
Cattle, fuch as Sheelp Hogs andCows: For as to the two

to difcover what it was; but after fomrne Time, our chief
* bMate going up the main Shrowds a little Way, and looking



ing at them  with a Perfpeitive, cry'd out it was an Army I could not imagine what he meant by an Army,
and fpoke a little hafftily, calling the Fellow a Fool, or
fome itch Word: Nay, Sir, fys he, don't be angry, for it
is an Army, and a Fleet too; for I believe there aie a thouLand Canoes, you may fee them paddle along, and they are
coming towards us too, apace, and full of Men..
I W As a little furpriz'd then indeed, and fo was my
Nephew, the Captain for he had heard fuch terrible Stories
of them in the Ifland, and having never been in thofe Seas
before, that he could not tell what to think of it, but
aiid two or three Times, we fhould all be devour'd. I
mult confefs, confidering we were becalm'd, and the Current fet trong towards the Shore, I lik'd it the worfe: However, I bad him not be afraid, but bring the Ship to an
Anchor, as oon as we came fo near as to know that we
rluft engage thenm.
THE Weather continu'd calm, and they came on apace
towards us fo I gave Order to come to an Anchor, and
frule all our Sails. As for the Savages, I told them they
had nothig. to fear but Fire; and therefore they fhoukf
get their Boats out, and faften them, one clofe by the
Head, and the other by the Sterma and Man them both
well, and wait the Iffue in that Pofture: This I did, that
the Men in the Boats might be ready with Sheets and Buckets to put out any Fire there Savages might endeavour
to fix upon the Outfide of the Ship.
IN this Pofture we lay by for them, and in a little
while they came tp with us; but never was fich a horrid Sight Ifeen by Chrfttias: My. Mate was much mila.
ken in his Calcultion of their Number, I mean of a
thoufand Canoes; the nmof we couk make df them when
they came up, being about a hundred andufix and twenty,
and a great many of them too -fo for me of them had
fixtee  or  ventee  Men in thoem, fome~Mor; and the
keallt i or-;3 -ven.
W   E N they came-nearer to us they ifem'd to be truck
with Wonder and Aftonifment, as at;Sight which they
htd doubtlefs never:eenbefore i nora coul they at firft,
aiwe afterwards undercfood, know what to make of us:
They came boldly up however very near to us, andfeem'd
G:to



t~o'go about, to row_ round us; but we call'd to ouir lvkt
in the Boats, not to let them come too near them.
T iH is very Order brought us to an Engagemenit witht
them, without our defiging it; for five or fix of their
lage Canoe came fo near our Long-Boat, that our Men
beckon'd with their Hands to'themn, to keep back, which
they'underflood very well, ~and wentt baick; h ut at their

is enough to name the Ports and Places, which we
touch'd at, and what occur'd to us upon our paffing from
one to another: We touch'd firft at the Ifland of Madagafcar; where, tho' the Peopiee fierce and treacherous,
and in particular, very well arm'd:4rith Launces and Bows,
which they ufe with inconceivable Dexterity, yet we fared
very well with them a while they treated us very civilly, and for fome Trifles, which we gave them, fuch as
Knives, Sciffars, &amp;ce they brought us eleven good fat
Bullocks, middling in Size, but very good in Flefhi which
we took in, partly for frefl Provifions for our prefent
fpending, and the reff to ait for the Ship's Ufe.
W   were obliged to ftay here fome time, after we hadfurnifh'd our felves with Provifions; and I, that was always too curious, to look into every Nook of the Wolld
wherecver I came, was for going on Shore as often as I
could: It was'on the Eaftfide of' the Ifland that we went
on Shore one Evening, and the People, *w  by theWay
are 'very nwrous, came thronging about us, and flood
7gazing at us at a Diftance: As- e hd traded freely with
them, ad had  been kidly ufed, we thought our felves in
no Danger, but when- we faw the Peole, we cut three
Boughs out of a Tree, and ltuck them  up at a Diftance
from us, which it feems, is a Mark in the Country, not
only of Trice and Friendfhip, butwhen it is accepted, the
other Side fet up three Pboes or Boughs alfo, which is a
Signal, that they acelptYtheTrueettoo   bt t he, then  is is a
known Condition of the Truce, that-you are'not to pafs
beyond their three Poles towards them, nor they comepaft
your three Poles or Boughs, towards you; 5o fthat you are
perfecly fecure within the three Poles, and all the Space
between your Poles and theirs, is allow'd like a Market,
for free Converfe, Traffick ain Commerce: When you go
there, you mull not carry your Weapons with you; and if
they come into that Space, they flick up their Javeines and
Launces, all at the firfl Poles, and come on unarm'd;:but if any Violence is offer'd them, and the Truce thereby
broken, away they run to the Poles, and ly hoki of their
Weapons, andh t th he Truce is at an Ei
I?



T happen'd one Evening when we went on Shore, that
a greater Number of their People came down than ufual,
but all was-very friendly and civil: They bi ought with them
feveral Kinds of Provifions, for which we fatisfied them,
with fuch Toys as we had; their Women alfo brought us
Milk, aud Roots, and fcveral Things very acceptable to us,
and all was quiet  and v  made us a little Tent or Hut,
of fome Boughs and -rees, and lay on Shore al that
Night..
N N o w not what was the Occafion, but I was not fc
well fatisfied to lie on Shore as the reft,. and the Boat lying at an Anchor, about a Stone's Caft fom the Land; with
two Men in her to take Care of her i I made one of them
come on Shore, and getting fome Boughs of Trees to cover us alfo in the Boat, I fpread the Saifon the Bottom of
the Boat, and lay under the Cover on board of the Branches
of the Trees all Night..
AsB o  T two a Clock in the Mirning, we heard one of
our Men. make a terrible Noiii on the Shore, calling ou
for God's Sake, to brig tle Boat in, and come and help
them, for they were ag like to murther'd.,  at the fame
Time, I heard thefiring of five Muskets, which was the
Number of the Guns they had, and that, three Times over, for it feems, the Natives here were not fo eafily
fi ihtedwith Guns, as the Savages were in.4nerica, where. ad to do.wii themfi..
ALL tWhiswiile, I knev not what wasthe Matter; but
ouzing immediately from Sleep with the. Noie  I caus'd
theBCat to.beithruf i, ad reolv', with three F silswe
ha   i3d o b ond, ad afiff our    kn.
W    gt te Boat foon to the Shore, but our Men were
in two much hte: For bing come-to the Shore, they
plngd ito the Water, to getto the Boat, with all e
Expeditn theycould, being purfued b  teen three and
four hundred Men e':      tr 'wer   but nine, in all, and
only five of thiem bad ^ Fufis ith ti; the reft indeed
had Piflols and Swords,  it they were of frmallUfe to
them.
WE took up even of our Men, and withr    Diffculty
enough too, three of them being very ill wounded; an that
which was ftill worfe, was, that while we ftood in theiBoat
to take our Menin, we. were. a as much.Danger as they
wert



were in on Shore;j for they pour'`d their Arr'ows in upon, us Iii
thick, that we were fasin, to barricade the Side of the Boat
lip with the Benches, land two or three looii Boards, which
to our gi-eat Satisfaafion, we had by irneie. Accident, or
Providence rather, in the Boat.,
A ND yet;, ha  it' been Dy-light, they' re it, iems,
fcixatMarkfirien, tha ifthey coudhveenbtte

we had, ly the Light of, the Moon a little Sight of them,
as they flood peltin~g us folon the Shore Wit Darts and
Arrows; and having got ready our IFire-Arms,, we gavethem a Volley, and we could hear by the Crie-s of fo'rne
of them  that' we had wounded feral      oeete
ifood thus in Battle-Array on the Shore still Breaikof Day,.

der my Command, before I engag'd in a Thing fo hatardous and mifchicvous, as I was brought into by it, without
my Knowledge or Delign.
W E took twenty flout Fellows.with us as any in the
Ship, befides the Supra-Cargo and my icif, and we landed
two Hours before Midnight, at the fame Place where the
I:dhans flood drawn up the Evening before; I landed here,
l-ccauie my Iefign, as I have faid, was chiefly to fee if
they had quitted the Fidld, and if they had left any Marks
behind them of the Mikchief we had done them; and I
thought, if we could furprize one or. two of them,
perhaps we might get our Man again by Way of Exchalne.
WE landed without any Noile, and divided our Men into two: Companies, whereof, theBoatfwain commanded
one, and I the other: We neither could hear nor fee any
body flir when we landed, fo we march'd up, one Body at
a Diftance from the other, to the Field of Battle: At firlt
we could fee nothing, it being very dark; but by and by,
our Boatfwain, that led the fit Party, fiumbled and fell
over a dead Boy; this made them halt a while, for knowing by the Circumftances that they were at the Place where
the Indiam  had food, they waited for my coming up;
here we concluded to halt 'till the Moon began to rie,
which we knew wouM be in leMs than an Hour; and then
we could eafy dicem the Havock we had made among
themi we told to and thirty Bodie upon theGround,
whereof two       not quite dead: Some had an Arm,
and fome a Leg fih  t off, and one his Head    thofe
that were wouned      we fupposd, they had carried away       '             '
W t N we ha4 made, as I thought, a full Difcovery of
of all we coul come at the Knowledge or, I was for going on Board again  but the Boatfwain and his Patty of
ten, fent me Word, that they were refov'd to make a Vi'fit to the Inrtian Town, where thefe Dogs, as they calt'd
them, dwelt, and defir'd me to go along with them; and
if they could find them, as flill they fanfied they fhould,
they did not doubt, they faid, getting a good Booty, and
it might be, they might find ThA. 7effy there, tbht wa
the Man's name w hd oft.

H A n 'they fent to ask my Leave to go, I knew well
enough what Anfwer to have given them; for I would
have commanded them inftantly on board, knowing it was
not a Hazard fit for us to run; who had a Ship, and Ship's
Loading in our Charge, and a Voyage to make, which depended very much upon the Lives of the Men; but as they
fent me Word they were refblved to go, and only ask'd me
and my Company to go along with them  I poiltively refus'd. it, and rofe up, for I was fitting on the Groupnd, in
order to go.to the Boats one or two of the Men, began to
importune me to go, and when I ftill refus'd pofitively, began to grumble, and fay they were not under my Command, and they would go: Come Jack, fays one of the
Men, will you go with me? I'll go for one; fack fiid he
would, and aother followed, and then another and in a
Word, they all left me but one, who, with much Difficulty too, I perfuaded to flay; fothcSupra-Cargo and I, with
the third. Man, went back to the Boat, where, I told them,
we would flay for them, and take Care to take in as many
of them asfhould heleft; for I tld 'em itwas a mad Thing
they were going about, and fuppofed mot of 'em would
run the Fate of Th.o, 7'effry
TH E Y told me, like Seamen, they'd warrant it they
would come off agan, and they would take care, &amp;c. 'So
away they went: I entreated 'e  to confider the Ship and
the Voyage  that their Lives were not their own, and
that they were entrufted with the Voyage ip fome meafure, that if they mifarry'd, the Ship might be loft for
want of their Hlp, and that they could not anfwerit to
Gocfr Man tI t faid a great dei more to, m on that
Head, butiI might as wiellhavetalk'd to the Maini-Mafl of the
Ship, they were mnad upora their Journey, only they gvo
me good Words, and begg   I would not be angry  id,
they would be' very cautious, and they did not doubt but
they wouM be back:again in saout an Houat arthe,
for the Indian Tow, they aid, was not above half a Mile e
Off: Tha' ttey found it: betve two Miles before:rhe. gt to

Attempt -was defpe ate, and fuch, as none but Madmen
would have gone about, yet to give 'em their due, they
went



went about it warily as well as boldly7- They were galantly armed, that's true; for they had every Man a Fuzee or
Musket, a Bayonet, and every Man a PiftFo; fome of them
had broad Cutlaffes, fome of them Hangers and the Boatfwain and two more had&amp;Pole-Axes: Belides all which,
they had among them Thirteen Hand-Grenadoes: Bolder
Fellows, and better provided, never went about any wicked Work in the World.
W ui E N they went out, their chief Defign was Plunder,
and they were in mighty hopes of finding Gold there; but a
Circurnfiance which none of them were aware of, fet
them on fire with Revenge, and made Devils of them all:
When they came to the few Indian Houfes, which they
thought Jhad been the Town, which was not above half a
Mile off; they were under a great Difappointment, for
there were not above i 2 or thirteen Houfes,, and where
the Town was, or how big, they knew not: They confulted therefore what to do, and were fome time before
they could refolve; For if they fell upon there, they muft
cut all their Throats, and it was ten to one but fome
of them might efcape, it being in the Night, tho' the
Moon was up; and if one efcaped, he would run away,
and raife all the Towns, fo they fhould havea whole Army
upon them: Agin, on the other baud, if they went away and left thofe untouch'd (for the People were all
afleep) they could not tell which Way to look for the
Toown.',.
Ho w E    i, the laf was te be Advice i fo they refolved to leave thoi Houfes^ and look for the Town as
well as they could; T   ey went on a little way,nd fbunda
Cow  tied to  Tree thi they prefetly concluded, would
le;a4good Guideto h em; for- ty fi4, the Cow certainlybeonged to the -Town before tem, or the Town be-.lnd tkhemn, 1, f itiey anltied her, they fhould fee which
%hewnt        if1 hwent, back they  adothing to fay
hert  s but jf  went forwarx, they. hd nothing to do
but tolow her,    they cut the  ord, whjeh was made
of twifted Flags, and the Cow went on before them; in.a Word, the Cow led them dire/ly to the Town, which.as thoy reported, confifed of above oo0 Houfes, or Huts;
and in Ibme of theLf, they found feveral Families living
together.



HE R- E 'they found all Silent; as profoundly fecure, as
Sleep, and a Country that had never feen an Enemy of
that Kind, could-make them  upon this, they call'd another
Council to confider what they had to do; and in a Word,
they refoIv'd to divide themfelves into three Bodies, and to

Demenfions it was of, and Confider if they might ventu e
upon it, or no.
THEY did fo, and defperately refolv'd that they would
venture upon them; but while they were animating one
another to the Work, three of them that were a little before the reft, call out aloud, and told them they had found
Thom. jery; they all ran up to the Place, and fo it was
indeed, for there they found the poor Fellow, hang'd up
naked by one Arm, and his Throat cut; there was an In'dia Houfe jutby the Tree, wiere they found fixteen or
seventeen of the principal Indians who had been concern'd
in the Fray with us before, and two or three of them
wounded with our Shot; and our Men found they were
awake, and talking one toanother in that Houie, but knew
not their Number.

H.E~ W    furpriz'd to fee me and thre SuparCargo in the
Boat with no more than two Men, for one   adbeen left
to keepthe Boat; and tho' he was glad that we were wTl,
yet he was in the fame Impatience with us to Inow what
was doing; for the Noife continu'd and the Flame encreas'd: I ConTifs, it was next to an Impoftibility for any
Men in the World to reitrai their Curifity of knowing,
what had happcn'd, or heir Concern for the Safety of the
Men: In a Word, the Captain told me, he would go and
help his Men, let what would come: I argu'd with him
as I did before with the Men, the Safety of the Ship, and
the Danger of the Voyage, the Intereft of the Owners and
Merchants, &amp;c. and told him, I would go and the two
Men, and only fee if we could at a Diflance learn what
was like to be the Event, and come back and tell him.
IT 'was all one, to talk to my Nephew, as it was to
talk to the reft before; he would go, he aid, and he only
wiflh'd he ad left but ten Men in the Ship; for he could
not think of having his Mei lft for want of HIelp, hehad
rather, he faid, looe the Ship,:the Voyage, and his Life
and all; and fo away went he.
N o R was I any more able to flay behind now, than I
was to perfuade them not to go before; fo in ihort, the
Captain order'd two Men to row back the Pinnance, and
fetch twelve Men more from the Ship, leaving the LongBoat at an Anchor, and that when they came back, lix
Men fhould keep the two Boats and fix more come after
us; 1b that he left nly 16 Men in the Ship for the whole
Ship's Com  ny confited of 6y Men, whereo two were
loft in the fifi Qt, which brought this Mihief on.
B EI N G now onthe march, you may be fre we felt
little of the Ground we trode on; and being guided bythe
Fire, we kept no Path, but went dircly to the Place of
the Flame: If the  i   f th Guns was    rritig p us
before, the:ries othe              ere now oQpe. ite

'     Sexes:



Sexes: But I never had an Idea of the Thing it fel before,
nor is it poflible to defcribe it, or the Horror which was
upon our Minds athearing it.
H ow jE vER, we went on, and at length came to the
Town, thoW there was no entring the Streets of it for the
Fire: The firlt Objec we met with, was the Ruins of a
Hut or Houfe, or rather the A4hes of it, for the Houfe was
confum'd i and juit before it, plain now to be feen by the
Light of the Fire, lay four Men and three Women kill d d
and as we thought, one or two more lay in the Heap among the Fire: In fhort, ther   e were fch Intances of a
Rage altogether barbarous, and of a Fury, fomething beyond what was human, that we thought it impoliible our
Vnen could be guilty of it; or if they were the Authors of
it, we thought that every one of 'em ought to be put to
the worft of Deaths: But this was not all, we law the
Fire encreas'd forward, and the Cry went on juft as the
Fire went on, fo that we were in the utmoft Confufioln,
We advanc'd a little Way farther, and beheld, to pur Ailonitfment, three Women naked, crying in a moit dreadful Manner, and flyag, as if they had iideed had Wins,
and after them fixteen or feventeen Men, NaStives} in the
iame Terror and Conflernation, with three of our Englipb
Butchers, for I can call them no better, in their Rear, who,
when they could not overtake them, fir'd in among them,
and one that was killd by.their Shot fell down in our
Sighti when the reft law us, believing us; tobe their Enemies, and tbt we would murther thp -asrwell as: thofe

to get at fome of our People, aMd fee what Devil it was
pat'ld timn, and what they intended to do- and,. in a
Word, to commandlthem off, affuring them, Nat if they
ftay'd till Day-light they would hae a lindi d thouad '

me; and there was indeed*'a pitios Spe6acle among-them:
Some ofthemrn had their Feet teribly burt with trampling
and running thro' the Fire, others their Hands burnt, one
of. the Women had fallen down in"rhle Fire, and was almoft burnt-to DIeth before lhe cculd'get out again, two

Smoak; this, as I underftood afterwards was our Men falling upon the forty Men, who, as I faid, flood at the few
Houfes on the Way; of whom they kill'd fixtcen or fevcntccn, and fet all thofe Houfes on Fire, but did not meddle
with the Women or Children.
B Y that Time the Men got to the Shore again with
the Pinnace, our Men began to appear; they came dropping in, fome and fome; not in two Bodies, and in Form
as thlCy went out, but all in Heaps, ltraggling here, and
there, in fuch a Manner, that a fmall Force of refolute
Men might have cut them all off.
B u T the Dread of them was upon the whole Country:
The People were amaz'd, and furpriz'd, and fo fiighted,
that I believe a hundred of 'em would have fled at the
Sight of but five of our Men. Nor in all this terrible Action was there' a Man who made any confiderable Defencei they were fo furpriz'd between the Terror of the
Fire, and the fudden Attaque of our Men in the Dark, that
they knew not which Way to turn themfelves; for if
they fled one Way, they were met by one Party, if back
again, by another; fo that they were every where knock'd
down: Nor. did any of our Men receive the leaft Hurt,
except one who ftrain'd his Foot, and another had one of
his Hands very much burnt.
I was very angry with my Nephew the Captain, and
indeed wit  all thMe n, in my Mind, but with him in particular, as well for his a&amp;ing fo out of his Duty, as Comnider of the Shi, and having the Charge of the Voyage upthn as in     s iprmpting, rather than cooling,
the Rage of his Men, in fohody and cruel an Enterprize:
My Nephew aii &amp;   'd me very refpecfully, but told me,
that when he fay the Body of the poor Seaman, whom
they lid ixifther'd i fucih a cruel and barbarous Manner,
he was not Malater of hieff, neither could he govern his
Pafifion: He, own',. he fhfid not have done fo, as he
tVas Commander of the Ship;i but as he was a Man, and
i       oture nov'd hlim, he coild not ber it: As for the reft,
of the Men, they were not fubjec to me at all, an they
kutw it well enough; f     o they itkfno notice of ni Diflike.
T. E~,neSt Daay'e fet ail, b we never heard any more
of it: Our  en dififrd in the Account of the Number
they


f,.}.A



they kill'd: Some fiid one Thing, Come another; but according to the beft of their Accounts put altogether,
they kiI'd or dcftroy'd about Iyo People, Mtel, Women, and Children, and left not a Houfe ifanding in the
Town.
As for the poor Fellow, Tho. Jeffys, as he was quite
dead, for his Throat was bf cut, that his Head was half
off; it would do him no Service to bring him away, bo
they left him  where they found him, only took hin
down from the Tree where he was hang'd by one
Hand.
H o w E v E R juft our Men thought this A&amp;ion to be, I was
againft them  in it and I always after that Time, told
them, God would blaff the Voyage, for I look'd upon all
the Blood they fhed that Night to be Murther in them:
For tho' it is true, that they had kiil'd Tho. effrys, yet it
was as true, that  effrys was the Aggreflr, had broken
the Truce, and had violated or debauch d a young Woman
of theirs, who came to our Camp innocently; and on the
Faith of their publick Capitulation.
THE Boatfwain defended this Quarrel when we were afterwardson board: Hefaid, Itwas true, that we qPemi'dto break
the Turce, but really had not, and that the War was begun
the Night before by the Natives themfelves, who had flot at
us, andkill'd one of our Men without any juft Provocation
fo that as we were in a Capacity to fight them, we might
alfobe in a Capacity to do our felves Juftice upon them, in
an extraordinary Manner; that tho' the poor lan had taken
a little Liberty with a Wench, he ought nottohave been murther'd, and tat in fuch a villainous Manner: And that they
did nothing but what was- juif, and what the Laws of
God allow a to be,.done to Murtherers.
0 N E would think this Ihould have been enough to hat-e
warn'd us, againft going on Shore among 4Heahens and
Barbaians; But it is impoffible to make Mankind wit,
* ut at their own Expence, and their Experience feemns
to be always of. moft Ufe to them, when it is deaic.e
bought..
We were now bound to the Gulph of Perfa, nd from
theace to the Coaft of Coromandel, only to touch at Sirrat: But the chief of the SuprCargo's Defign lay at the
Bay of Bengale, where, if he mifs'd of his Bufmnef; outH 3                       ward



ward bound, he was to go up to China, and return to the
Cbaft as he came Home.
THE firft Diafler that befel us, was in the Gulph of
lPerjia, where five of our Men venturing on Shore, on the.Arabian Sideof the Gulph, were furrounded by the Arabs,
and either all kiIl'd, or carried away into Slavery; the reft
of the Boat's Crew were not able to refcue them, and had
i     ut juft Time to get off their Boat. I began to upbraid
them  with the juft Retribution of Heaven in this Cafe,
lbut the Boatfwain very warmly told me, he thought I
went farther in my Cenfures, than I could ihew any Warrant for in Scripture, and referr'd to the t3th St. Luke,
Verfe 4th, where our Saviour intimates, that thofe Men,
on whom the Tower of Siloam fell, were not Sinners above all the Galileans  but that which indeed put me to
Silence in the Caie, was that none of thefe five Men, who
were now loft, were of the Number of thofe who went,
on Shore to the Mafacre of Madagafrar; (j$ I always calU'
it, tLo' our Men could net bear the Word Maflacre with any
Patierce;) And indeed, this laft Circumflance, as I have,aid, put me to Silence for the preient.
B U T my frequent preaching to them on this Subjc&amp;,
had worfe Coniequences than I expeled; and the Boat-:fw-ain, who had been the Head of the Attempt, came up
boldly to me one Time, and told me, he found, that I
continually brought that Afifair upon the S tage, that I made
Ynjuft Refleftions tpon it, and had ufed the Men very ill
on that Account, and himfelf in particular; that as I
was bIt.a Pallinger, and had no Command in the Ship,
ol Conicn in the Voyage, they were not oblig'd to bear
it, that they did not Iknow, but I might have fome
ill Defign in my Head, and perhaps to call them to Account for it, when' they came to Englund; nd that therefore, unlef;' would refolve to have done with it and alalfo, not to concern my felf any farther with him, or
any of his Affairs, he would leave the Ship; for he
did not think it was fafe to fil with me anong
them.
I I E A R D him patiently.enogh till he, had dope, and
tl-en told him, that I did confefi  had all along opposd
the Maa4cree of       f    for fitch I would afways call:    '                    it;



ft; and that I had on all Occafions, fpoken my Mind freely about it, tho-' not more upon him than any of the reft;
tha't as to -my having no, Command in the Ship, that
was true: n or did I exe~rcife any Authority, ~only took m- y
Liberty of fpeaking nay. Milbi id T hings. which publickly
concernt'd us all, as to what Concern. I bad in the Voyage,
that wa~s none of his B ufine'fs; I lwas a confiderable Ow~ner
of th Ship, and in, that Claim I conceived I had a Right
to fek, even farther than I had yet done, and would not
be accountable to him or any, one -elfe, and begaun to be a

I w A S very glad to fee my.Nephew, I muff confefs;
for I was not without Appreheniions, that they would
confine him by Violence, fet fail, and run away with the
Ship, and then I had been ffrip'd naked in a remote Conntry, and nothing to help my felf: In fhort, I had been in
in a worfe Cafe, than when I was all alone in the Illand.
B  T they had not come that length, it feems, to my
great Satisfa&amp;tion; and when my Nephew told me what
they had faid to him, and- how they had fworn, and ifook
Hands, that they would one and all leave the Ship, if I was
iuffer'd to come on board, I told him, he fhould not 1 e
concern'd at it at all, for I would flay on Shore; I only
defir'd he would take Care and fend me all my neceffary
Things on Shore, and leave me a fufficient Sum of Money, and I would find my Way to England, as well as I
eould.
T H s was a heavy Piece of News to my Nephew; bi.t
there was no Way to help it, but to comply with it; So,
in fihort, he wvcnt on board the Ship again, andt fatisfy d
the Men, that his Uncle had yielded to their Importunity,
and had fent for his Goods from  on board the Ship; ib
the Matter was over in a very few  Hours, the M'n 1eturn'd to their Duty, and I began to confider what Courle
I fhould fleer.
' ws: now alone in the remoteff Part of the World,
4s I thfk I may ca ll it  for I was near three thoufand
Leagues by Sea farther off from England, than I was at my
fland j only it is true, I might travel heie by Land over
the Great Moguls Country to Suratte, might go from
thence to Baffira by Sea, up the Gulph of PerJia, and from
thence might take the Way of the Caravans, over the Defarts
of Arabia to ileppo and Sandarocn; trom thece by Sea agaiq
to Itafl, and fo over Land into Franc,. and this rut togethEr
might be at eaff a full Diameter of the Globe; but if it
were to be mrnafur'd, I' fuppofe it would appear to be a
great deal more.
I  A i another Way before me, whiiCh was tr Wait for
fone Egli/h- Ships, thich wei coming to Bengadl fiom.c/ld. on the Ifland 1of SiOaa, and get Paflige on board

of the Mallayans, who had kill'd the Captain and three of
his Men; and that after the Captain was killd, thefc Men,
Eleven in Number, had refolv'd to run away with the
Ship, which they did  and had brought her in at the Bay
of Bengale, leaving the Mate and five Men more on.
Shore, of whom, we fhall hear farther.
W ELL, let them  come by the Ship how they would,
we came honeffly by her, as we thought tho' we did not,
I conlfef examine into Things fo exadly as we ought, for
we never enquired any Thing of the Seamen; who, if we
had examin'; would certain y have fauker'd in their Accounts, contradicted one another, and perhaps contradiaed
themfelves; or one how or other, we ihould have feen

your Fate flould blind you againft good Advice; but afiare
your elf, if you do not put to Sea immediately, you will
the very next Tide be attaqu'd by five Long-Boats full of
Men, and perhaps, if you are taken, youll' be hang'd for. a
Pirate, and the Particulars beexamin'd afterwards: I thought
Sir, added he, I thould have met with a better Reception
than this, for doing you a piece of Service of fuch Importance: I can never be ungratefil, faid I, for any Service,
or to any Man that offers me any Kindnefs, but it is paft
my Comprehenlion, laid I, what they fhould have fuch a
Dceign upon me for; however, ffnce you fay, there is no
Time to be loft, and that there: is forme villainous Defign
in Hand, againft me, '11 go on.board this Minute, and put
ta Sea immediately, if my Men can ftop the Leak, or if
wei can fwim without floping it; But, Sir, faid I, Iall I
go away ignorant of the Rfeafn of all this? Can you give
me no farther Light into it?
I c  N tell you btt Part of the Story, Sir,,iys he, but I
have a Dutch Seamen here wit me; and I believe I could
perfuade him to tell you the re,; but there is fearce Time
for it: But the ihort of the Story is.this, the firft Part of
whichl ~uppofe, you' know wll enouh (i) )  that yoU
was with thaShip at Spumtra tiat thre yotuCaptain   was
imurther d b7 the Mllans with three of his Men; and
that you, or -fome of thofe that were on board with you,
ran away with the Ship, and are fince turn'd PLR  /TES;
this is the Sum of the Story, and you will be all feia'd as
Pirates, I can affure you; and executed with very litte Ceremony; for you know,  Merchants Ships fhew but little
Lw to Pi&amp;ates, if they get them in their Power.
N o w you fpeak plain Znglifh ifidIi ard  thInk you;
and tho' I know nothing, that we have doe, like what
you talk pf, butam fure we came honeftrl ai 'fyti  by
the Ship, yet feeing fuch Work is a doing as you fay, and
that you eem to mean honeffly, Ill be upon my Guard;
nay, Sir, fays he, do not talk of being upon yur Guard
the beft Defence is to be out of the Danger; if you have any
Regard to yeur Life, and the Life of all your Men, put
out to Sea witiout fail-at High-Water, and as you have a
whole Tide before you, you   b gone too far out before
they cn come down, for they will come away at High;
Water,,and as they have twenty Miles to come, yWi g

they would live and die with us: Then I ask'd the Captain,
what Way he thought bell forus to manage a Fight with
them? For refift them  I reColv'd we would, and that to
the laft Drop; he faid readily, That the Way was to keep
them off with our great Shot, as long as we could, and
then to fire at them with our fmall Arms to keep them
from boarding us; but when neither of thefe would do
any longer, we fhould retire to our clofe Quarters; perhaps they had not Materials to break open our Bulk-Heads,
or get in upon us.
T H E Gunner had in the mean Time Order, to bring
two Guns to bear foreand aft, out of the Steerage, to clear
the Deck, and to load them with Mufquit-Bullets and fmal
Pieces of old Iron, and what next came to hand, and thus
we made ready for Fight; but all this while kept out to
Sea, with Wind enough, and could fee the Boats at a Diatance being five large Long-Boats, following us, with al
the Sail they could make.
Two of thefe Boats, which by our GlaiTes we coul
fee, were Englh, had out-Ifikd the tre, were near two
Leagues a-head of them, and gain'd upon us confiderab
fo that we found they would come upwth -us     upon
which we fired a Gun without a Shot, to intimate, that
they fhould bring too, and we put out a Fhg of Truce, as
a Signal for Parley; but they kept crowding after us, tilU
they came within Shot: Upon this we took in our white
Flag, they having made no Anfwer to it,' hdng out a red
Flag, and fired at them with a Shot; notwithifaiding this,
they came on, till they were near enough to call to them
with a fpeaking Trumpet, which we had on b6ard; fo
we call'd to them, and bid them keep off at their Peril.
IT was all one, they crowded after us, and endeavouted to come under our Stern, fo to board us on our Quar.
ter; upon which, fieeing they were refolute for Mifchief,
and depended upon the Strength that follow'd them, I ordered to brir the Ship too, fo that they lay upon our Broadfide, when immediately we fired five Guns at'them; one
of which, had been levelled fo true, as to carryr away the
Stern of the hinddrmoft Boat, and bring them  to tle Necefity of taking down theirSail, and running all to the
Head of the Boat to keep her from finking, fobfhe lay
by, and had enough. of it J but feeing the fremoft Bot
crowd



crowd ftill on after us, we made ready to fire at her in particular.
WHI L E this was doing, one of the three Boats that
was behind, being forwarder than the other two, made np
to the Boat which we had â diabled, to relieve her, and Awe
could afterwards fee her take out the Men; we call'd again
to the feremoft Boat, and offer'd a Truce to parley again,
and to know what was her Bulinefs with us but had no
Anfwer, only fle crowded ciofe under our Stern  upon
this, our Gunner, who was a very dexterous Fellow, run
out his two Chaie-Guns, and fired again at her; but the
Shot mifling, the Men in the Boat ihouted, wav'd their
Caps, and came on; but the Gunner. getting quickly ready again, fird among them the fecond Time; one Shot
of which, tho' it mirsd the Boat it feif, yet fell in among
the Men, and we could eaily fee, had done a great deal of
Mifchief among them, but we taking no notice of that,
war'd the Ship again, and brought our Quarter to bear upon themi  and firing three Guns more, we found, the Boat
was fplit almoft to Pieces; in particular, her Rudder, and
a Piece of her Stern was fhot quite away, fo they handed
their Sail immediately, and were in great Diforder; but to
compleat their 19isfortune, our Gunner let fly two Guns
at them agin; where he hit them we could not tel, but
-we fruad the Boat was finking, and fome of the Men already in the Water; upon this, I immediately man'd out
our Pinnace, which we had kept-clofe by our Side, with
Orders to pick up fome of the Men if they could, and
five them from  drowning, and immediately to come on
board with them; becaufe we iaw the reft of the Boats
began to come up; our Men in the Pinnace follow d their
Orders, and took up three Men; one of which was juft
drowning, and it was a good while before we could recover himi as boon as they were on board, we crowded all
the Sail wcould make, and lood farther out to Sea, and
we floid that when the other three Boats came up to the
firft two, they gave over their Chace.
B E IN G thus deliver'd from a Danger, which though I
knew' not the Reafon of it, yet feem'  to be much greater
than I apprehended i I took Care that we would change
ur Cotrfe, and not let arty one imagine whither we were
goingj fo we atrod out to Sea Eaftward, quite out of the.                                  Courfe



CourSe of all European Ships, whether they were bound to
China, or any where elfe, within the Commerce of the
European Nations.
W H EN wewere now at Sea, we began to confultwith
the two Seamen, and enquire firft, What the Meaning of
all this fhould be: The Dutchman let us into the Secret
of it at once; telling us, that the Fellow that fold us the
Ship, as -we faid, was no more than a Thief, that had run
away with her: Then he told us, how the Captain, whofe
Name too he told us, tho' I do not remember it now,
was treacheroufly murther'd by the Natives on the Coaft
ofMallaca, with three of his Men; and thathe, this Dutchman, and four more got into the Woods, where they wandered about a great while  till at length, he in particular,
in a miraculous Manner, made his Eecape, and fwam off
to a Dutch Ship, which fiiling near the Shore, in its Way
from China, had fent their Boat on Shore for frefh Water;
that he durft not come to that Part of the Shore where
the Boat was, but made fhift in the Night, to take into
the Water farther off, and fwimming a great while, atlaft
the Ship's Boat took him up.
H E then told us, that he went to Battavia, where two
ofthe Seamen belonging to the Ship had arriv'd, having defetted the reft in their Travels, and gave an Account, that
the Fellow, who had run away with the Ship, fold her at
Bengale, to a Set of Pirates, which were gone a Cruiing
in her; and that they had already taken an Englif Ship and
two Dutch Ships very richly laden,.T H S latter Part, we found to concern us dire&amp;ly, and
tho' we knew it to be falfe  yet, as my Partner faid very
well, if we had fallen into their Hands, and they had had
fuch a Prepofliefion againit us before-hand, it had been in
vain for us to have defended ourfelves, or to hope  r any
goodQuarrersat their Hands; efpecidily confidjng tthatbur
A-ufirs had been our Judges, and that We cold )e expe&amp;t   nothing from them; but what Rage,.oul nhave
ditated, and ungoverned Paflion have execut   dd therefore itias his Oinin, we     fuld   de.ly tiack to
Bengalf, froi whence we came, without puttingjn at any Port whatever; bcaufe there, we coUgive an Ace
count of our felvs, and could prove wherewewEe when
the



the Ship put in, who we bought her of, and the Iike;
and, which was more than all the reft, if we were put to
the Neceffity of bringing it before the proper Judges, we
flould be Cure to have fome Juftice, and not be hang'd firft,
and judg'd afterward.
I w A s fometime of my Panner's Opinion; but after a
little more ferious thinking,.I told him, I thought it was
a very great Hazard for us to attempt returning to Bengale, for that we were on the wiong 8ide of the Straits
of Malacca; and that if the Alarm was given,;we fhould
be fure to be Way-laid on every fide, as well by the Dutch
of BPttavia, as the EngfifJ dief-where; that if we fhould
be taken, as it were, running away, we fhotld even condemn our, felves, and there would want no more Evidence
to deftroy us &lt; I alfo asked the Englih Sailor's Opinion,
who faid, he was of my Mind, and that we flhould certainly be taken.
T i s D&gt;anger, a little ftartled my Partner and all the
Ship's Company; and we immediately relblved to go away to the Coaft of TonqRn, and io on to China, and
from thence purfuing the firftDefign, as to Trade, find
fome Way'or other to difpofe of the Ship, and come back
in fome of the Veifels of the Country, fuch as we could
get: This was approved of as the beft Methd for our Security; and accordingly we feered away N.N. E. keeping
-bove fifty Leagues off from the ufual Courf to the Eaftward.
T HIS however put us to Come Inconveniences; for firft
the Winds, when we came to that Diftanee from the
Shore, feem'd to be ' more fteadily againft us, blowing almoff Trade, as t: call it fromI the EaR, and E. N.E. fo
that we were a long whileupon our Voyage, and we were
but ill provided with Viiuals for o liong a Run; and,
which was fill wotfe, ther wase      ereas  that thofe

I M us T rconfef, I was now very 'neaf, ad thught
my F, 'includiing the late Efcape from. the LongBoats,
to'e been in the moft dangerous Condition that ever I
was



was in,. thro' all my.paft Life;j for whatever ill Circum.
flances I had been in, I was, never PurIfs ed for a Thief be.
fore; nor had I ever done any Thing that hixerited the Name
of Diiiioneft or Fraudulent, mouch lefis Thievilfh: I had
chiefly been mine own Enemy,. or, as I may rightly flay,
I had been no body's Enemy but my own: But now I
was cmbarrafs'd in the worft Condition imaginable; for
tho' t was pcerfety innocent, I was in no Condition to
mae  ht  pocenqe aper   nd if I had been taken
it had been un(cr a fppfdGuilt of the 'worft Kind),at Ic al, a Cri me.efteem' fo~ among the People I had to do
with.
T Hn s made me verty anxious Tto' make an Ekcape, tho',
which Way to do it, I,knew not;- or what Port or Place
wve flioul gto    MyPartner feeing me thus dejefted,
tho' he wstemfcocern'd at flrft, began to encourage
mne; and defcribing to me the feveral Ports of that C oaft,
told me he would put in, on the:Coallof Chochinthina, or
the, Bay ofTotzqun intending toga aftrtwards to mvthc o,

ftill a great many Eurepeati Fanlilies reIided4,;and particU__
larly the, Miffionar y Prieftsi ufually- vent, tfhfiter,, in order
Ito their going forward to China.
H ' i TH E then we refolved to, go;j and accordingly, tho'
after a tedious and irregular C~our1[;, and very muc ftrait,ned for Provifions, wecamen within iSight of ihe-Coaftve-.
ry early in the Morning;i and upon Reflediort,!upon the

People Thieves, even by Occupation or Profefflon; -and
tho' it is true, we had not much to leek of them, and ex.
cept getting a few Proviiions, car'd not how little.we had
to do with them, yet it was, with much Difficulty, that
we kept our felves from  being infulted by them feveral
Ways.
W F. were in a fmall River of this Country, within a
few Leagues of its utmoft Limits Northward; and by our
Boat we coafted North-Eaft to the Point of Land, which
opens the great Bay of Tonquin; and it was in this Beating
up.along the Shore, that we difcover'd as above, that, in a
Word, we were furrounded with Enemies. The People we
were among, were the moft barbarous of all the Inhabitants of the Coaft; having no Correfpondence with any other Nation, and dealing only in Fifh, and Oil, and fuch
grofs Commodities; and it may be particularly ieen, that
they are, as I aid, the moft barbarous of any of the Inhabitants, (viz.) that among other Cuftoms they have this as
one, That if any Veflel have the Misfortune to be Shipwreck'd upon their Coaft they profently make the Men
all Prifoners, that is to fay, Slaves; and it was not long before we fouid a Spice of their Kindnefs this Way; on the
Occation following.
I H.A VE obierved above, that our- Ship fprung a Leak at
Sea, and that we could not findit out; and however, it happend, that as I have faid, it was itop'd unexpe&amp;edly, in the
happy Minute of our being to be feiz'd, by the Dutch and
Englifh Ships, near the Bay of Siam; yet as we did not find
the Ship fo perfeity tight and found as we delir'd, we refolv'd, while we were in this Place, to lay her on Shore,
take out what heavy Things we had on board, which
were- not many, and to wafh, and clean her Bottom; and, if poflible, to find out where the Leaks
were.
A    o R o N G L Y, havinglightned the Ship, and brught
all our Guns, and other moveable Things to one Side, we
try'd to bring her down, that we might come at her Bottom i for on fecotd Thoughts, we did ibt care to lay her
dry, aground, neither could we find out a proper Place
for it.    -.
T a E Inhabitants, who had never been acquainted with
Lucha Sight, came wonering down to the Shore, t look at
us;



us; and fteing the Ship lie down on one Side in fuch a
Manner, and heeling towards the Shore, and not fteing
our Men, who were at work on her Bottom with Stages,
and with their. Boats on the off Side, they prefently concluded, that the Ship was caft away, and lay fo very faft
on the Ground.
0 N this Suppofition, they came all about us in two or
three Hours Time, with ten or twelve large Boats, having
fome of them eight, fome ten Men in a Boat, intending,
no doubt, to have come on board, and plunder'd the Ship,
and if they had found us there, to have carry'd us
away for Slaves to their King; or whatever they call
him, for w, knew nothing, who was their Governoulr.
WHEN they came up to the Ship, and began to row
round her, they difcover'd us all hard at work, on the
Out-fide of the Ship's Botto'm and Side, wafling, and
raving, and flopping, as every Sea-faring Man knows
how.
T n EY flood for a while gazing at us, and we, who
were a little furpriz'd, could not imagine what their Defign was i but being willing to be fure, we took this Opportunity, to get fome of us into the Ship, and others to
hand down Arms and Ammunition to thofe that were at
work, to defend themielves with, if there fhould be Occaion; and it was no more than need; for, in lefs than
a Quarter of an Hour's Confultation, they agreed, it feems,
that the Ship was really a Wreck, that we were all at
work, endeavouring to fave her, or to fave our Lives by
the Help of our Boats, and when we handed our Arms into the Boats, they concluded, by that Motion, that we
wereendeavouring to fave fome of our Goods; upqn this
they took it for granted, we all belong'd to them  and away they came direcly upon our Men, as if it had been ili
a Line of Battle.
OUR Men, feeingCo many of them, began to befrighted; for we lay but in an ill Poflure to fight, and cry'd out
to us, to know what they ihould do? I immediately call'd
to the Men, who work'd upon the Stages, to flip them
down, and get up the Side into the Ship  and bad thole
in the Boat to row round and come on board; and thofe
few of us, who were on board, work d with all the Strength
I                        4



and Hands we had, to bring the Ship to rights; but however, neither the Men upon the Stage, nor thofe in the
Boats, could do as they were order'd, before the Corhinchineffes were upon them; and with two of their Boats boarded
our Long-Boat, and began to lay hold of the Men as their
Prifoners.
T HE firfl Man they laid hold of, was an Englifi Seaman, a flout ftrong Fellow, who having a Musket in his
Hand, ncver offer'd to fire it, but laid it down in the
Boat, like a Fool, as I thought: But he underflood his Buinefs better than I could teach him, for he grappled the
Pagan, and dragg'd him by main Force, out of their own
Boat into ours i where, taking him by the two Ears, he
beant his Head fo againft the Boats Gunnel, that the Fellow
dy'd inftantly in his Hands and in the mean Time, a Dutchman, who flood next, took up the Musket, and with the
But-end of it, fo laid about him, that he knock'd down
five of them, who attempted to enter the Boat; but this'
was doing little towards refiting thirty or forty Men,
who fearlefs, becaufe ignorant of their Danger, began to
throw themfelveslinto the Long-Boat, where we had but
five Men to defend it: But one Accident gave our Men a
compleatVi&amp;ory, which deferv'd 6ur Laughter rather than
any thing elfe, and that was this:
O U R Carpenter, being preparing to grave the Out-fide
of the Ship, as well as to pay the Seams, where he had
caulk'd her to ftop the Leaks, had got two Kettles jufr let
down into the 3Boat; one fill'd with boiling Pitch, and the
other with Rofin, Tallyow, and Oil, and fuch Stuff, as the
Ship-Wi ights ufe for that Work; and the Man that tended the Carperter, had a great Iron Ladle in his Hand, with
*which he fupplyfd the Men that were at work with that
hot Stuff; two of the Enemyr's' Men entred the Boat juft
where this Fellow ftood, being in the Fore-f4eets; he immediately faluted them with a' Ladleful of the Stuff, boiling hot, which fo burnt and fcalded them, being half naked, that they roar'd out like two Bulls, and, enrag'd with
the Fire, leap'd both into the Sea: The Carpenter faw it,
and, cry'd oxut, Well dorne,; ark, give them fome more of
it; when ftepping forwara him7a~f, rhe takes one of their
Mops, and dipping it in the Pitch-Pot, he and his Man
thew it aftig them f plentiflly, that, in fMort, of all
' *                               -      the



the Men in three Boats, there was not one that was not
fcalded, and burnt with it in a moif frightful pitiful Manner, and made ~uch a iHowling and crying, that I never
heard a 'worf Noife, and indet nothing like it  for it is
worth obferving, That tho Pain naturally makes all People cry out, yet every Nation have a particular Uay of
Exclamation, and make Noifes as different from one another, as their Speech; I cannot give the Noife, thefe Creatures made, abetter Name than Howling, nor a Name more
proper to the Tone of it  for I never heard any Thing
move, like the Noife of the" Wolves, which, as I have
faid, I heard howl in the Foreft on the Frontiers of Languedoc.
I w A s never pleasdM with a Vi&amp;ory better in my Life;
not only as it was a perfef Suiprize to me, and that our
Danger was imminent before: But as we got this Viatory
without any Blood-fhed, except of that Man the Fellow
killd with his naked Hands, and which I was very much
concern'd at; for I was fick of killing fuch poor Savage
Wretches, even tho' it was in my own Defence, knoWing
they came on Errands, wHih they thought jtift, and new
no better; and that tho' it may be a juft Thing, 'becaiuf
necefiary, for there is no inecefary Wickednefs in Nature;
yet I thought it was a fid Life when we nmuft be always
oblig'd to be killing our Fellow-Creatures to preierve our
felves, and indeed,I think fo fill i and would even now fuffer a great deal, rather than I would take away the Life,
even of the worft Perfon injuring me:; I beieve afo a
confidering People, Who know the Value of Life, would
be of my Opinion, if they entred ferioufly into fhe Con
deration of it.
B      to return beo my Story'; all-the while this was doing, my Partner and I, who manag'd the reft of the Mea
on board, had with great Dexterity brought the Ship almoft to rights; andiaving  gtiten the Guns into their
*   laces again, theGunner cafd to me, to bid our Boat get

we fuppoied, to fee their Miftake, and give over the Enteprize, finding it was not as they expe&amp;ed  Thus we
ot clear of this merry Fight-; and having gotten fome
Rice, and fome Roots, and Bread, with about lixteen good
big Hogs on board, two Days before; we refolv'd to flay
here no longer, but go forward whatever came of it; for
we made no Doubt but we fhould be furrounded the next
Day with Rogues enough, perhaps more than our PitchKittle would difpofe of for us.
W E theiefore got allour Things on board the fame Evnping, and the next Morning was ready to fail; in the
mean Time, lying at an Anchor fbme Dillance from the
Shoje, we were not fo much concern'd, being now in a
fighting Pofture, as well as in a failing Poffure, if any Enemy had prefented: The next Day having finifl'd our
Work within boad, and finding our Ship was perfetly
heal'd of all, her Leaks, we fet fail; we would have gone
into the Bay of Torqum; for we wanted to inform our lelves
of what was to be known concerning the Dutch Ships that
had been. there; but we durit not *and in there, becaufe.
we had feeni veral Ships go inj as we fuppo0'd, but a little before;,fo we kept on N.E. towards the Ifle of Formofa, as much.afraid-of being feen by a Dutch or Englifh
Merchant Ship, as a Dutch or Englih Merchant Ship in the
Mediteraean is pf a  lgerine Man of War., -W.H E  we were thus got to Sea, we kept on N. E.
'as if w'e iould go tothe Manillas or the Philippine Iflands;
and this we did that we might'not fall into the Way of
any tof.the European Slhps; and then we fteer'd North again, till we cafme to the Latitude of zz Degrees, 20 Minutes; byf which Means we made the Ifland of Formofa
dire&amp;ly, -where we came to.an Anchor, in order to get. Water, and fiefl Provifions, which the People there, who
are very purt~ous and civil in their Manners, fupply'd us

F R O h:hence we fail'd ftill North, keeping the Coaft of
China at anr equalDiftance, till we knew we were bevond

come; being refolv'd, if poffible, not to fall into any of
their Hands, efpecially in this Country, wvhee, as our Circumftances were, we could not fail of being entirelyr ruin,edi nay, fo great was my Fear in particula-, as to my being taken by them, that I believe finily, I would much

E* I   GB EI   now come to the Latitude df 36 Degees, we
refolv'd. to put into the firft Trading, Port we flhuld come
at; and ftanding in for the Shore, a Boat came off two
Leagues to us, with an oldPortuguezeP Piloton board, whoknowing us to be an European Ship, came to offer his Service, which indeed we were very glad of, 'and took him
otboard; u por which,. without asking us, whither we,
would go, he difinifs'd the Boat he came in, pnd fent it

I T Ho U  HT it was now fo miuch in our Choice, to
make the old Man carry us whither we would, that I began to talk with him about carrying of as to the Gulph
of Nanquin, which is the moft Northern Part of the Coaft
of china: The old Man faid he knew the Gulph of Nanquin very well; but, finiling ask'd us, wlt we would do

He told us our beft Port had been to have put in at Macao, where we could not fail of a Market for our Opium,
to our Satisfaction, and might for our Money have purchas'd all Sorts of China-Goods, as cheap as we could at
Nanquir.
N     o  being able to put the old Man out of his Talk, of'
which he was very opinionated, or conceited, I told him,'
we were Gentlemen, as well as Merchants, and that we
had a Mind to go and fee the great City of Peking and th.

the old, Man, you. aould go to Ninge, where, by the River which runs into the Sea there, you may go up within
five Leagues of the Great Canal: This Canal is a ravigable made. Stream, which goes thorough the Heart of that

Defcription of the Ship, that they will be fure to know

to hang them all up at the Yard-Arm.
W H A T! fays 1, will they execute them right or wrong,
hang them firfi, and judge them afterwards? 0, Sir! lays
the old Pilot, there's no need to make a formal Bufinefs of
it with fuch Rogues as thofe, let them tie them Back to
Back, and fet them a diving i 'tis no more than they rightly deferve.
I KNEW I had my old Man fail a-board, and that he
could do me no Harm, fo that I turn'd fhort upon him:
Well, now Seignior, faid I, and this is the very Reafon,
why I would have you carry us up to Ninffun, and not
to put lack to Macao, or to any other Part of the Country, where the Englifh or Dutch Ships come; for be it
known to you, Seignior, thofe Captains of the Engli/ and
Dutch Ships, are a Parcel of rafh, proud, infolent Fellows,
that neither know what belongs to Juftice, or how to
behave themfelves, as the Laws of God and Nature diredt;
but being proud of their Offices, and not underfianding
their Power, they would a&amp; the Murtherers to punifh
Robbers; would take upon them to infult Men falfly accufcd, and determine them guilty without due Enquiry
and perhaps I may live to call iome of them to an Account for it, where they may be taught how' Juftice is to
Le executed, and that no Man ought to be treated as a Criminal, till fome Evidence may be lhad of the Crime, and
that he is the Man.
W  T H this I told him, that this was the very Ship they
had attack'd,and gave him a full Account of the Skirmifl we
had with their Boats, and how fooliflhly and coward-like
they behavd: I told him all the Story of our buying the
Ship, and how the Dichmen ferved us: I told him the
Reafons I had to believe that this Story of killing the Mafter by the Malayans was true  as alfo the running away
with the Ship; but that it was all a Fi6tion of their own,
to fuggeft that the Men were turn'd Pirates; and they
ought to have been fure it was fo, before they had. ventur'd to attaque us by Surprize, and oblige us to refift 'em
adding that they would have the Blood of thofe Men, who
we killd there in our juft Defence, to anfwer for.
Tug



THE old Man was amaz'd at this Relation, and told
us, w  were very much in the right to go away to the
North, and that if he might advife us, it fhould be to fell
the Ship in China, which we might very well do, and buy
or build another in the Country; and, faid he, tho' you
will not get fo good a Ship, yet you may get one able enough to carry you and all your Goods back again to Bengale, or any where elfe:
I T OLD him, I would take his Advice, when I came
to any Port whera I could find a Ship for my Tun, or
get any Cuftomer to buy this: He reply'd, I Zould meet
with Cuffomers enough for the Ship at Nanqwfin, and that
a Chinefe Junk woukd ferve me very weilto go back again; and that he would procure me People, both to buy
one, and fell the other.
W EL L, but Seignior, fays I, as you fay they know the
Ship fo well, I may perhaps, if I follow  your Meafures,
be infhumental to bring fome hfneIt innomeit Men into a
terrible Broil, and perhaps to be murther'd in c6ld Blood;
for where-ever they find the Ship, they will prove'the
Guilt upon the Men, by proving this wa tfShI;, fand fo&lt;
innocent Men may probably be overpower'd andr murther'd:
Why, fays the old Man, I'll find out a Way to prevent that:
alf;o for as I know all thofe Commanders you fpeak of very
well, and fbhal fee them all as they pasi by, I 'weill be fure
tofet them to rights in the Thingi and let: them  kiovrw
that they had been fo mnuch in thle wrng,^. t t  te, the

whicla



which our PFrtugueze Pilot gave it, and':pronouncM it as
above, jqinchang.
A s we were unanimous in our Refolutions, to go ti*
this Place, we weigh'd the next Day, having only gone
twice on Shore, where we were to get frefh Water; on
both which Occations, the People of the Country were
very civil to us, and brought us abundance of Things to
fell to us; I mean, of Provifions, Plants, RCors, Tea, Rice,
nd fome Fowls; but nothing without Money.
':;W.E came to the other Port, (the Wind being contrary)
not till five Days, but it was very much to our SatisfaeCion, and I was joyful, and I may f.y thankful, when I fet
my Foot fafe on Shore i refolving, and my Partner too,
that if it was poffible to difpofe of.our fclves and Eftdss,
any other Way, tho' not every Way to our SatisfaCion,
we would never fet one Foot on board that unhappy Veffel more; and indeed I muft acknowledge, that of all the
Circumnfances of Life, that ever I had any Experience
of, iothing makes Mankind fo compleatly mife;ale as
that, of beig in conftant Fear: Well does the Scripture
fay, the Fear of Man brings a ~nXre it is a Life of Death,
and the Mind is fo entirely fupprefs'd by it, that it is capable of no Relief; the animal Spirits link, and al' the Vigour of Nature, which ufually fupports Men under other
Affli&amp;ions, and is prefent to them in the greateft Exigencies, fails them here.
Nor did it fail of its ufnal Operations upon the Fancy,
by heightening every Danger, reprefenting the Englih and
Dutch Captains, to be Men uncapable of heariing Reafon,
or of dftfinguifhing between honeft Men and Iogues; oi
between a Story calculated for our own Turn, made out
of nothing, on purpoe to deceive and a true genuine Account of our whole Voyage, Progref, and Defign; for we
might many Ways have convinced any reaonable Creature, that we were not Pirates  the Goods we had o
board, the Courfe we fteer'd, our fiankly fhewing our
felves, and entring into fuch and fuch Ports, even out ve-y Manner, the Force we had, the Number of Men, the
fw  Arms, little Ammunition, fhort Provifions i all thefe
would have ferv'd to convince any Men, that we were no
Pirates  the Opium and other Goods we had on board,
would make it appear the Ship had been at Bengale; the
Dutcmen,



Dutchmen, who it was fiid, had the Names of all the Merthat was in the Ship, might ealily &amp;ee that we was a Mixture of E~nli/,3, Portugueze, and Indian,, and but two Dutchmen on Board: Thefe, and many other particular Ciicumflances, might have made it evident to the Undcrftanding
of any Commander, whofe Hands we might fall into, that.
we were no Pirates.
B U   Fear, that blnd ufelefs Pafion, work'd another
Way, and threw  us into the Vapours; it bewildied our
Underfiandings, and Let the Imagination at work, to form
a thoufand terrille Things, that peiliaps might never happen; we fili fupposd, as indeed evety Body had related.
to us, that the Seamen on board the ~ngli-j and Dutch
Ships, but efpecially the Dutch, were ib enraged at the
Name of a Pirate, and efpecially at our beating of their
Boats, and efcaping, that they would not give themfelves
Leave to enquire, whether we were Pirates or no; but
would. execute us off Hand, as we call it, without giving
us any Roomr for a Defence; we refle&amp;ed, that there was
really fo much apparent Evidence before them, that they
would fcarce enquire after any more; as firt, that the Sh'p
was certainly the fame, and that Lome of the Seamen among them   knew her, and had been on board her; and,,
fecondly. That when we had Intelligence at the River
Cam&amp;odia, that they were coming down to examine us,
we fought their Boats and fled; t; that we made no doubt
but they were fully fatisfy'd of our being Pirates, as we::
were fatisfy'd of the contrary; and I as oftien faid, I knew
not but I Ihould have been apt to have taken the like Circumfances for Evidence, if the Tables were turn'd, and.
my Cafe, was theirs, and have made no Scruple of cutting
all the Crew to pieces, without believing, or perhaps confidering, what they might have to offer in their Defence.^
B U  let that be how it will, thofe were our Apprehenfionsi; and.bothmy Partner and-I too, fcarce flept a Night,
without dreaming of Halters, and Yard-Arms; that is to
fay, Gibbets; of fighting, and, being taken; of killing, and
and being kili'd; and one Night 1 was in fuch a Fury in
my Dream, fancying the Dutctmen had boarded us, and I
vras knocking one of their Seamen down, that I truck my
double Fill againft the tide of the Cain I-lay in with fuch
a Fec&lt;e, as wqouned my Hard moif giievoufly, boke mn
Knuckles,



Knuckles, and cut and bruited the Flefl; fo that it not onrly wak'd me out of my Sleep, but I was once afraid I
hould have loft two of my Fingers.
ANT H E R Apprehenfion I had, was of the cruel Ulage.
we fhould meet with from them, if we fell into their Hands
then the Story of Amboyna came into my Head, and how
the Dutch might perhaps torture us, as they did our Countrymen there * and make fome of our Men by Extremity
of Torture, confefs thofe Crimes they never were guilty
of; own themielves, and all of us to be Pirates, and ti
they would put us to Death, with a formal Appearance of
Juftice; and that they might be tempted to do this, for
the Gain of our Ship and Cargo, which was worth four
or five thoufand Pounds, put altogether.
TH E s E Things tormented me and my Partner too,
Night and Day; nor did we coniider that the Captains of
Ships have no Authority to at thus; and if we had furrender'd Prifbners to them, they could not anfwer the defthoying us, or torturing us, but would be accountable for
it, when they came into their own Country: This I fay,
gave me no Satisfation; for if they will ad thus with
us, what Advantage would it be to us, that they would be
call d to an Account for it; or if we were firft to be murthered, what Satisfadion would it be to us, to have them
punifl;ed wheit they came Home?
I cannot refiain taking Notice here, what Reflections I
now had upon the paft Variety of my particular Circumftances; how hard I thought it was, that I who had- fpent
forty Years in a Life of continu'd Difficulties, and was at
laft come as it were to the Port or Haven, which all Men
drive at, (viz.) to have Reft and Plenty, fhould be a Voluntier in new Sorrows, by my own unhappy Choice;.
and that I, who had efcaped.fo many Dangers in my Youth,
ihould now  come to be hang'd in my old Age, and in fo
remote a Place, for a Crime T was not in the leaft inclin'd
to, much lets guilty of; and in a Place and Circumftancc,
where Innocence was not like to be any Protetion at all
to me.
A r T E R thefe Thouglts, irmething of Religion would
come in j and I fhould be coniidering, that this feem'd to
me to be a Difpofition of immediate Providence, and. I
tught. tolook upon it, and f4bmit to. it as iuch i that air
".  J,l0'



tho' I was innocent as to Men; I was far from being innocent as to my Maker; and I ought to look in and examine, what other Crimes in my Life, were moff obvious to meS and for which, Providence might jufily infli&amp;
this Punifhment, as a Retribution, and that I ought to fubmit to this, juft as I would to a Ship-wreck, if it had
pleafed God to have brought fuch a Dilffter upon,
me.
I N its Turn, Natural Courage would fometimes takes its
Plece; and then I would be talking my felfup to vigorous Refolutions, that I wonul not be taken, to be barbaroufly ufed
by a Parcel of metcilefs Wretches, in cold Blood; that it
were much better to have fallen into the Hands of the Savages, who were Men-Eaters, and who, I was fure, would
feaif upon me, when they had taken me; than by thofe,
who would perhaps glut their Rage upon me, by inhuman
Toitures and Barbarities; that in the Cafe of the Savages,
I always refolv d to die fighting, to the laft Gafp, and why
fhould I not do fo now, ieeinz it was much 'more dreadful to mre it %taft, t&amp;thint of falling into tihee Mens Hands,
than ever it was to think of being eaten by Men; for the
Savages, give them their due, would not eat a Man till he
was dead, and kill'd them firif, as we do a Bullock; but
that thefe Men ha  many Arts beyond the Cruelty of
Death; Whenever there Thoughts prevail'd, I was fure to
put my felf 'i a kind of FeverY withthe Agitations of a
fippotd Fight; nmy Blood would bei, and my Eyes fpatkle
as i' I was engag'd; and I always refoltvd that I would
take no Quarter at their Hands, but even at laft, if I could
refift no longer, I would blow up the Ship and all that
Was in her, and leave them but little Booty to boaft of.
B Y how much the greater Weight the Anxieties and
Perplexities of thefe Things we to our Thoughts while we
bwer. at Sea, by fo much the greater was our Satisfation;
When-we lkw our Ielves.i1 Shore; and my Partner told
me he dream'd, that he had 'a very heavy Load upon his
Back, which he was to carryLup a Hil, and found that hi
was not able to ftand long under it; but that the Portugueze
Pilot came and took it off his Back, and the Hill difappcar'd, the Ground before hintm hewng all finooth and
plain; and truly it was fo, we were all like Men, who had
i Load taken off their BaDcs.i  +



O ola thy Par, T had a Weight taken off from my M~arf~l
tlat, I was riot able aby longer -to bear; arid, as I Paid' above,
we refolv'd 'to goa no more to, Soa in that Ship When'vwe
came on Shore,-the old Pilot, who was now our Friend,
got us a Lodging and a. Ware -Houfe for our Goods, which:
by, the Way,. was mitch the famne; it was ~a little Houfe or
Hut, With A Jai-" Hou~i joining b-, '',to it, all built with Canes,,
and palliladoed round with large Canes, to keep out pil-,
furing Thieves, of which  it feems, there were not a. few
in thatCountry'; however, the Magifirates allow'd us alI.
aliftle Guard-, ande we, had a Soldier w'ith a kind ofHalbert,,
or Ha4  ie wh     lo    etinel, at out Dbor; to whont
we allow'd a Pinit of Rice, and a little Piece of Money
alxiut the Value of- three Pence per Day,. fo that our Goods,
were kept very fafe.
~ri,,~ Fair or Mart, ufuilly kep t in this Place, had been
over ~fornte Timt~ how'ever, we funid that there were threet
or four ~jufk s in the River, and two f/tpanneys;. J mean
hips frm   apanz, with Goods wrhich they had1 boug-ht hi,
bia ndwere not goDne 'away, 'having, Japonefe Mer-,
chants Nott Sh ore.
T tnE firfi Thing 'our old PorruuVeze Pilot did fobr us,
was to bring us accquainted with rhee nmiffionary' Romi~jf~
Priefis, w~ho wiere in the ToWn, and who ha been thereibrnue dmtim, convertu~ the Peo le 'to Chriftiany i but, we

that thefe Religious, who we call Miffionaries, have a firm

only the Fatigue of the Voyage, and Hazards of living in

a great want. of Charity in us, whatever Opinion we haveof
the Work itfelf, and the Manner of their doing it, if we fhould
not have a good Opinion of their Zeal, who undertake it
with fo many Hazards, and who have no Profpe&amp; of the
leaft TemporalAdvantage to themfelves.
B UT to return to my Story  this French Prieft, Father
Simon, was appointed it feems, by Order of the Chief of
the Mifion, to go up to.Peking, the Royal Seat of the
Chinefj Emperor, andwaited only for another Prieff, who
was order'd to come to him from Macao, to go along with
him; and we- fcarce ever met together, but he was inviting me to go that Journey with him, telling me, how he
would fhew me all the glorious, Things of that mighty
Empire; and among the reit, the greateft City in the
World  a City, faid he, that your Leoulon and our Paris
put together cannot be. equalto,; This wa  the City. of
Peking, which I confefi is very, great, and ininnitely full
of People, i but as I look'd on thofe Things with different'
Eyes from other Men, fC I 'hall gie my Opinion of thm,
in few Words, when I come in theCourfe of my:Travels, to fpeak more particulaily of them.
B U r firfi, I come to my Fryar, or Miffionary; dining
with him one Day, and being very merry together, I f.ew d
fiome littl Iinclinatiop to go with him, nd he prefs4 mq
and m~y Partner rery hard, 'ahd with a great many Perfipa
rions. to confent; why Father Siman, fays mny Partner
why ihould you defxre our Company fo tuch; You know
we af  lereti6cs, and you do not love us, nor, cannot kcep
us Company with' any Pleafure; 0! iys he, yon may
perhaps be good"Carholicks in time; my Buiinei here is
to conve:t HeatHens, and who knowsbut. I mii y convt
you too f Very well Fatlher tai Id, fo you wili'preacH tO



us all the Way; I won't be troublefome to you, fays he,
our Religion does not diveft us of good Manners; betides,
fays he, we are here like Countrymen, and fo wre are,
compared to the Place we are in; and if you are Hugonots, and i  a Catholick, we may be all Chriffians at lait
at leaft, faid he, we are all Gentlemen, and we may conve- it fo, without being uneafy to one another: I lik'd
that Part of his Difcourfe very well, and it began to put
me in Mind of my Priei, that I had left in rhe Bra`j;s
but this Father Simon did not come up to his C!i!aht1r,
by a great deal; for tho' Father Simon had no appea-ance
of a Criminal Levity in him neither, yet he had not that
Fund of Chriffian Zeal, ftri&amp;  Piety, and fincere Affe&amp;ion
to Religion, that my other good Ecclefiaftick had, of whom
I have laid fo much.
B u T to leave him a little, tho' he never left us, nor Soliciting us to go with him i but we had fomething elfe
before us at that time; for we had all this while our Ship,
and our Merchandize to difpofe of, and we began to be
very doubtful what we fhould do, for we were now in a
Place of very little Bufinefs; and once I was about to venture to fail for the River of Kilam, and the City of Nanquin:
But Providence feem'd now more vifibly, as I thought, than
ever, to concern itfelf in our Affair; and I was encouraged from this very Time, to think, I fhould one Way
or other, get out of this tangled Circumftance, and bebrought
Home to myv own Country again; tho' I had not the leaft
View of the Manner, and when I began fometimes to
think of it, could not imagine by what Method it was to
be done: Providence, I fay, began here to clear up our Way
a little'; and the firrt Thing that offered was, that our old
Port guuzue Pilot brought a  Ap'aP   Merchant to us, who
began to enquire vwht Goods we had, and in the firft
Place, he bought all our Opiu n, and gave us a very good
Price for it paying us in Gold by Weight, ome in fmall,
Pieces, of their own Coin, and tome in fmall Wedges, of
about ten or eleven Ounces each: While we were dealing
with him for our Opium, it came into my Head, that
he might perhaps deal with us for the Ship too, and I
ordered the Interpreter to propofe it to him; he fhrunl
up his Shoulders at it, when it was fifft propos'd to
him; but in a few  Days after, he came to me with one
of



of the Miffionary Priefts for his Interpreter, and told me,
he had a Propoal to make to me, and that was this; he
had bought a great Quantity of Goods of us, when he had
no Thoughts (or Propofais made to him) of buying the
Ship, and that therefore, he had not Money enough to
pay for the Ship  but if I would let the fame Men who
were in the Ship navigate her, he would hire the Ship to
go to 7apan, and would fend them from thence to the
P'hilippine Iflands with another Loading, which he would
pay the Freight of, before they went from Japan; and
that at thei Return he would buy the Ship: I began to
lifen to his Propofal, and bf eager did my Head ftill run
upon Rambling, that I could not but begn to entertain a
nodon myfelfof going with him, and; to fail from the.hilippine Iflands, away to the South-Seas and accordinglyI ask'd they fapwef Merchant, if he would not hire us to
the Pthlrippie Iflands, and difcharge us there; he faid, no,he could not do that, for then he could not have the Retarn of his Cargo  but he would dikchare us in [fapa
he Laid, at the Ship's Return; Well, ftill I was for taking
him at that Propofal, and going myfelf y but my Partner,
wier than myfelf, perfuaded me fi-om it, reprefenting the
Dangers, as well of the Seas, as of the yapoefas, who are
a fali, cruel, and treacherous People; and then of the sponirds at the Pkil ppines, more falfc, more cruel, more treache-ous than they.
B u T to bring this long Turn of our Affairs to a Conclufion; the firf Thing we had to do, was to confultwith
the Captain of the Ship, and with his Men, and know if
they were willing to go to fapan  and while I was doing this, the young Man, who, as I faid, my Nephew had
eft with me as my Companion for my_ Travels, came to
me, and told me, that he thoughtthat Voyage promifed very
fair, and that there was a great Profpet of Advantage, and
be would be very glad ifI undertook it  but that if I
would not, and would give him leave, he would go as a
Merchant, or how I pleas'd to order him; that if ever he
came to Vngland, and I was there, and alive, he would
render me a faithful Account of his Succefs, and it fhould
be as much mine as I ples'd,
I was really loth to part with him, but confidering the
Proipet of Advantage which was really confiderable, and
that



that he was aryoung Fellow, as likely to do well in it, as. any I knew, IT inlin'd to lei himgo; but firft I told him, r
~would confult my 'Partner, andgive him an Anfwer the
next Day; my Partner and I difcours'd atout it, and my
Partner tnmde a mroff genrous Offer;( he told me, you know
it has beenI an unlueky Ship, and we both refolve not to
go to Sea in it again; if your Steward, fo he call'd my Man,
will venture the Voyage, III leave my Share of the Veffel
lo him and let him make the beff of it; and if we live to
meet in Engand, and he meets with Succefs abroad, he
fall account for one half of ti  ProMfis of the Ship's Fright
to us, the othr ThaW be his own.
I F 'my Partne, who was no Way concerned with my.yo-ug Man, madei min ihehariOffer, I could do no lefs thati
iof   him the fane, and all ihe Ship's Company being
wiffig to go With him, we made over half the Ship to
'lim in Property, and took a Wriring from him, obliging
him to account fOr the dther, and away he went to yApmn: The J'a    Merchant -pro'd a very tuntual hronef
)iMat o  m   pinotet   him at y^op,:ddg t him  L UJ enfe tf cme oa Sh6re, which he Eu     rm in genern
have  ot, lately obtained  pay'd him his Freight very.
IpuntJly.feant him to, the Phiippifts, loaded with  ftpF
tied Chi)'.Wtes, and a Supra-Carga of their own, who,
trafficking  tih the Spaniards, brought back European
Goods again, and aigreat Qtiant tiy of Cloves, and other Spice;
and:there he was not only pay'd his Freight very wel, and'
at a:v ery good Frice but being not willing to fell the Shipthen, the Merchant firnifh'd him with Goods, on hisowtf
Account 'that fbr fb~me Money; and fome Spices of his
own, which he brought with lim, he went back to the:
Mauilla s, to the Spaniirds, where he fold his Cargo very
well: Here having gotten a good Acquaintance at Manilta,
he got his Ship tade a free Ship; and the Governour of
Minilal hired him, to go to Accapuco, in A'ertca, onthe
Coaft of Mexico,, and gave him a Licene to. Land there,'
and travel to          toexico, and to pal} in any-SpanJyt$ Shi to^
Europe, with all his Men.   v:
I H ak made th  V age tot6  ccap. very:happty
there he fold his Ship, and hiain  the atiaiid A-:
lowance to travel by Lancd to Pfrto' B, he found Means
brome how or other, to get to famxia, with all his Trea6m i



Sure; and about eight Years after came- to Eingaand
exceeding rich: Of which, 1 f all i take Notice ill its
Place; in the mean Time) I return to our particular Affairs.
BEI NG now to part with the Ship, and Ship's Company; it came before, us of Courfe, to conrider whatReconmpence we fhould give to the two Men, that gave us fuch
timely Notice of the Defign a!ain{f us in the River of
Cam;odia: The Truth, was, they had done us a confide-c
ble Service, and deferv'd well at our Hands, though, by the
Wy, they were a Couple o Rogues too   for as they believ-d the Story of our being.Pirates,and that we had really run
away with the Ship, they, came down to us, not only to
betray the Defign thwat was formtl againft us but-to go to
Sea with us as Piratees, and one of them  confefs'dt afterwards, that nothing elfe but the Hopes of going a Rogtl
ing, brought him to do it: However, the Service they did
us was not the lefs; and therefore, as I had promis'd to be
grateful to them, I firm order'd the Money to be pay d to
them, which fthey aid was due tohm;onr  trthei
refpeive Ship s, that is to fiy, the Engj m  nin eteen
Months Pay, and to the Dutchman feveni and over and above hat, I gave them, each themhem, a ffiall Sum  of
Money in God, and which contented them rvery well;
then I made the Engl7hman Gunner in the Ship, the Gunner being now made Second-Mate, and Purfer; the Dutchman I made Boatfwain i fo they were, both very well
pleas'd, and prov'd. very  rviceable, being both- able. Seamen, and very flout Fellows.
WE were now on Shore in China; if I thought my
clfbanih'd, and remote fiom  my own Country at Bengale, where I had many WVays to get home for my Money; t hat could I think of my felf now? When I was
gotten about a thoufand Leagues farther off from Home,
and perfetly deflitute of all manner of Plofpe6t of Return.
A LL we had for it was this, that in about four Months
'Time, there was to be another Fair at the Place whe e we
were, and then we might be able to purchafe all Sorts of
the Manufatures of the Country, and withal, might pof-,
fibly find fome Coinee Tunks or Veflels from  Nanqui,
t would be to be fold, and would carry us and our
Goods,



Goods, whither we pleas'd; this I lik'd very well, and refolv'd to wait; befides, as our particular Perfons were not
obnoxious, fo if any Enlisf/ or Dutch Ships came thither,
perhaps we might have an Opportunity to load our Goods,
and get Paflage to fome other Place in India, nearer
Home.
U p o N thefe Hopes we refolv'd to continue here; but
to divert our felves we took two or thrce Journeys into
the Country; firft we went ten Days Journey to fee the
City of N lquin, a City well worth feeing indeed; they
fay it has a Miilion of People in it; which, however, I do
not believe; it is regularly built, the Streets all exactly ftrait,
and cro1s one another, in direCt Lines, which gives the Figure of it great Advantage.
B u T when I came to compare the miferable People of
thefe Countries with ours; their Fabricks, their Manner of
Living, their Government, their Religion, their Wealth,
and their Glory, (as ibme call it) I muft confefs, I do
not fo much as think it worth naming, or worth my
while to write of, or any that flall come after me to
read.
I T is very obferveable that we wonder at the Grandeur,
the Riches, the Pomp, the Ceremonies, the Government,
the ManufaCures, the Commerce, and the Conduct of thefe
People; not that it is to be wonder'd at, or indeed in the
Icaft to be regarded  but becaufe, having firif a Notion of
the Barbarity of thofe Countries, the Rudenefs and the Ignorance that prevails there, we do not expect to find any
fuch Things fo far off.
O T H E R  I s E,. what are their Buildings to the Palaces
and Royal Buildings of Europe! What' their Trade, to the
univerfal Commerce of England, Holland, France and Spain.
What their Cities to ours, for Wealth, Strength, Gaity of
Apparael, rich Furniture, and an infinite Variety? What
are theit Ports, fupply'd with a few Junks and Barks, to
our Navigation, our Merchants Fleets, our large and powerful Navys? Our City of London has more Trade than all
their mighty Empire: One Englih, or Dutch, or French
Man of War of 80 Guns, would fight with, and deftroy
all the Shipping of China: But the Greatnefs of their Wealth,
their Trade, the Power of their Government, and Strength
of their Armies, is furpifing to us, becaufe, as I have lid,
COQ*



confidering them as a barbarous Nation of Pagans, little
better than Savages, we did not expe&amp; fuch Things among
them   and this indeed is the Advantage with which all
their Greatnefs and Power is ieprefented to us, otherwife
it is in it felf nothing at all; for as I have aid of their
Ships, fo may be fid of their Armies and Troops; all the
Forces of their Empire, tho' they were to bring two Millions of Men into the Field together, would be able to do
nothing but ruin the Cointry, and ftarve themfelves: If
they were tobeiiege a ftrongTown inFanders, or to fight
a dfciplin'd Army, one Line of Gertan Cu ialiers, or a
French Cavaly, would overthrow all the Horfe of China
a Million of their Foot could not fland before one embattled Body of our Infantry, pofted Co as not to be furrounded, though they were not to be one to twenty in
Number    nay, I do not boaft, if I fiy, that 30000 German or Englth Foot, and Iooco French Horfe, would fairly beat all the Forces of China: And fo of our fortified
Towns, and of the Art of our Engi ers in aflaulting and
difending Towns; theree's   ot a fretfied Town in China,
could hold out one Month againft the Batteries and Attaques of an Europta   Army; and at the fame Time, all
the Armies of China ould ntever takeifuch a Town as
Dunkirk, proided it wia  ot t arwr'dno, not i ten Years
Siege. They have Fire-Arms, 'tis true; but they are awkward, clumfy, and uncertain in going off; They have Powder, but it is of no Strength  They have neither Difcipline
in the Field, Exercifeto:iheir Arms, Skillto attaque, or
Temper to retreat; and therefore, I mufi confefs, itieem'd
ftrange to me, when I caine home, and heard our People
iay fich fine Things of the. Power, Riches, Glory, Magnificence, and Tradeof the inefe;becaufe I fw andkiew, that
they were a contemptible k erd, or Crowd of ignorant bfrdid Slaves, fubjeded to a GoVernment qualified only to rule
fuch a People; and, in a Worid fbt I am now laich'd quite
bfide my Defign, I fy, in a Word, were not its Diftance
inconceiebly great frttnMtf.iy, and was 'mot ihehMufco.
Wite Emipire almofR as;ude, impbtent, andrill.gh   nd:a

in the World, fallen this Way, inflead of attaquing the
Warlike Swedes, in which Attempt none of the tlowers of
Europe would have envy'd or interrupted him; he might
by this Time have been Emperor of China, inftead of being beaten by the King of Sweden at Narva, when the
latter was not one to fix in Number: As their Strength
and their Grandeur, fo their Navigation, Commerce and
Husbandry, is imperfet and impotent, compared to the
fame Things in Europe   alfo in their Knowledge, their
Lcarning, their Skill inthe Sciences; they have Globes and
Spheres, and a Smatch of the Knowledge of the Mathematicks; but when you come to enquire into their Knowlcdge, how fhort-fighted are the wifeft of their Students!
they know nothing of the Motion of the Heavenly Bodies;
and fo grofly abfurdly ignorant, that when the Sun is eclips'd, they think 'tis a great Dragon has affaulted and run
away with it, and they fall a clattering with all the Drums
and Kettles in the Country, to f ight the Monrter away,
juft as we do to hive a Swarm of Bees.
As this is the only Excurfion of this kind whith I have
made in all the Acount I have given of my Travels, fo I
flall make no more Defcriptions of Countries and People,
'tis none of my Bufinefs, or any Part of my Deign; but
giving an Account of my own Adventures, thioulgh a
Life of inimitable Wandrings, and a long Variety  f Changes, which perhaps few have heard the like of, I flail lay
nothing of the mighty Places, defart Countries, and
numerous People, I have yet to pafs through, more than
relates to my own Story, and which my Concern among
them will make neceffary: I was now, as near as I can
compute, in the Heart of China, about the Latitude of
thirty Degrees North of the Line, for we were return'd
from Nanqfin   I had indeed a Mind to fee the City of
Peking, which I had heard fo much of, and Father Simon
importun'd me daily to do it; at length his Time of going away being fit, and the other Miiflonary, who was
to go with him, being arriv'd from Macao, it was neccffary
that we fhould refolve, either to go or not to go; fo I referr'd him to my Partner, and lef it Wholly t hisChoice,
who at length refolv'd it in the Affirmative, and we prepar'd for our Journey: We fet out with very good Advantage, as to finding the Way, for we got Leave to travel
in



in the Retinue of one of their Mandarins, a kind of Viceroy, or plincipal Magilhate in the Province where they
reiide, and who take great State upon them, travelling
with great Attendance, and with gleat Homage fiom the
People, who are ibmetinies greatly impoverifh'd by them,
becauie all the Countries they pafs thro' are oblig'd to firnifli Proviiions for them and all their Attendants: That
which I particularly obferv d, as to our travelling with his
Baggage, was this, that tho' we received fufficicnt Provifions, both for our felves and our IHores, from the Country, as belonging to the Madarin, yet we were oblig'd to pay
for every Thing we had, after the Market-Price of tle
Country, and the Madarin Steward, or Commiflary of
the Pjovifions, colle&amp;ted it duly fioln us; fo that our travelling in the Retinue of the Mandarin, tho' it was a very
gieat Kindnefs to us, was not fuch a mighty Favour in
him, but was indeed a gieat Advantage to him, confidering
there were about thirty other People travell'd in the fame
Manner beiides us, under the Protedtion of his Retinue, or
as we may call it, under his Convoy: This, I fay, was a
great Advantage to him, for the Country furnifh'd all
the Proviiions for nothing, and he took all, our Money for
them.
W E were five and twenty Days travelling to Peking;
through a Country infinitely populous, but miferably cultivated; the Husbandry, Oeconomy, and the Way of living,
all very miferable, tho' they boaft fo much of the Induftry
of the People i I fiy, miferable; and fo it is, if we who
underfland how to live Were to endure it, or to compare
it with our own, but not fo to thefe poor Wretches who
know   no othet: The Pride of thee People is infinitely
great, and exceeded by nothing, but their Poverty, which
adds to that which I call their Mifery: I muft needs think -
the naked Savages of America live much more happy, becaufe, as they have nothing, fo they defire nothing, whereas thefe are proud and iniolent, and in the main are meer
Begars and Drudges i their Oftentation is inexpreffible, and
is chiefly fhew'd in their Cloaths and Buildings, and in the
keeping Multitudes of Servants or Slaves, and, which is to
the laft Degree rediculous, their Contempt of all the World
but themfeves.


I MUST



w



I MvSr confefs, I travell'd more pleafantly afterwards In
theDefirts and vaft Wildernefles of Grand Tartary, than
here and yet the Roads here are well pav'd, and well kept,
and very convenient for Travellers; but nothing was more
aukward to me, than to fee fuch a haughty, imperious, infoiknt People, in the midft of the groffeft Simplicity and
norance, for all their fam'd Ingenuity is no more; My
riend Father Simn   and I us'd to be very merry upon theif
Occafions, to fee the beggarly Pride of thofe People; for
Example, coming by the Houfe of a Country Gentleman,
as Father Simon calld him, about ten Leagues off of the City
of Nanquin, we had firft of all the Honour to ride with
the Mafter of the Houfe, about two Miles; the State he
rode in, was a perfe&amp; Don  xickotifm, being a Mixture of
Pomp and Poverty.
T n E Habit of this greay Don was very proper for a
Scaramouch, or Merry-Andrew; beinga dirty Callicoe, with
all the tawdry Trappings of a Fool's Coat, fuch as Hanging-Sleves, Toffels, and Cuts and Slahes almoft on every
Side; it cover'd a richTaffaty Veit, as greafy as a Butcher,
and which teftify'd, that his Honour muft needs be a moft
exquilite Sloven.
H is Horfe was a poor, lean, larv'd, hobbling Creature, -
fuch as in England might ill for about 30 or 4o Shillins,
and he had two Slaves follow'd him on Foot, to drive the
poor Creature along; he had a Whip in his Hand, and he
elabour'd the Bea  as fatR about the Head, as his Slaves
did about the Tail, and thus he rode by us with about
ten or twelve Servants, and we were told he was going
from the City to hi Country-Seat, about half a League
before us: We trill'd on gently, but this Figure of a
Gentleman rode away before us, and as we ftop'd at a Vilage about an Hor t refreih us, when we came by the
Country-Seat of this great Man, we fw him in a little
Place, before his Door, eating his Repaft; it was a kind
of a Garde   ut he was eafy to be fenl and we were gie6h to  n      d, tnat the more W  look'd on him, the
better he would be pkasd..     H  fit under a Tree, fmethinglik the Palmetto Tree,
which effe&amp;ually thale  him  over the Head, and on the
Suth Side; but under the Tree alo, was plac'da argeUmbrella, which made that Part look well enough; he fat
lolling back in a great Elbow-Chair, being a heavy corpuK                        lent



fent Man, and his Meat beingbrought him by two Women
Slaves; he had two more, whife Office, I think, few
Gentlemen in Ewrope would accept of their Servicein (viz.)
One fed the Squire with a Spoon, and the other held the
Difh wifA one Hand, and fcrap'd off what he let fall upon
his Worfhip's Beard and Taffai  teR, with the other
while the great fat Brute thought it below him to employ
his own Hands in any of thofe familiar Offices, which
Kings and Monrachs would rathbe do, than betroubled
with the clumfy Fingers of their Servants.
I TooK this Time to think what Pain Mens Pride
puts them to: and how troublefomeahaughty Temper, thus
ill-manag'd, mufl be to a Man of common Senfe; and
leaving the poor Wretch to pleafe himfelf with our looking at him, as if we admir'd his Pomp, whereas we really
pitryd and contemn'd him, we purfu'd our Journey; only
Father Simon had the Curiofity to fRay to inform  himfelf
what Dainties the Country Juflice had to feed on, in all
his State; which he faid he had the Honour to tafte of,
and which was, I think, a Dole that an Englifh Hound
Voulk fcarce have eaten, if it had been offer'd him, (viz.)
a Mefs of boil'd Rice, with a great piece of Garlick in it,
and a little Bag fill'd with Green Pepper, and another Plant
which they have there, fomething like our Ginger but
fmellling like Musk, and tailing like Muftard; all this was
put together, and a fmall Lump  or Piece of lean Mutton
boil'd in it  and this was his Worflip's Repaf, four or
five Servants more attending at a Diflance. If he fed them
meaner than he was fed himielf, the Spice excepted, they
murf fare very coarfely indeed.
A s for our Mandarin, with whom we travel'd, he was
iefp'eed like a King y furrounded always with his Gentlemen, and attended n all his Appearances with fuch Pomp,
that I fw     litle of him but at a Diftance; but this I obfer'd tht there was not a Horfe in his Retinue, but that
our Caniers Pack-Horfs in England em to me to look
much better, but they were fo cover'd with Equipage,
Mantles, Trappings and iuch-like Trumpery, that you cannot fice whtheer they are fat or lean; in a Word, we
coulde fe carce    y thing but their Feet and their
heads.

to confulting together what was to be dot, and I ask'd
my Partner what he thought of the Pilot's News, and
whether it would fuit with his Affairs? He told me he
would do juft as I would, for he had fetled all his Affairs

HA IG refolv'd upon this, we agreed, that if our
Portugal Pilot would go with us, we would bear his Charges to Mufcaw, or to England if he pleas'd; nor indeed were
we to be efteem'd over generous in that Part neither, if
we had not rewarded him farther, for the Service he had
one us was really worth all that, and more; for he had
not only been a Pilot to us at Sea, but he had been alfolike a

%o we coufulted together about it, and being willing to gratify him, which was indeed but doing him Jufice, and very willing alfo to have him with usbefdes, for he was a
moft necefiary Man on all Occafions, we agreed to give
him a Quantity of coin'd Gold, which, as I compute it,
came to about ti7 Pounds Sterlingbetween us, ann tobear
all his Charges, both for himfelf and Horf, except only a
Horfe to carry his Goods.

I was now to tell him we was refolv'd he Ihould not go
back at all: That as we had refolv'd to go to Europe with
the Caravan, we refolv'd alfo he fhould go with us, and
that we call'd him to know his Mind: He fhook his Head,
and laid, it was a long ourney, and he had no Pecune to carry him thither, or to iubfift limfelf when he came there:
We told him, we believ'd it was fo, and therefore we had
refolv'd to do fomething for him, that fbould let him ife
how fenfible we were of the Service he had done us, and alfo how agreeable he was to us; and then I told him what
we had refolv'd to give him here, which he might lay out as
{wewould do our own; and that as for his Charges, if he
would go with us, we would fet him fafe a-fliore, ( Life
and CaTualties excepted) either in Mufcovy or England,
which he would, atour own Charge, except only the Carriage of his Goods.
H E received the Propoal like a Man tranfported, and
told us he would go with us over the whole World; and
fo, in fhort, we all prepar'd our felves for the Jouiney:
However, as it was with us, fo it was with the other
Merchants, they had many. Things to do, and inftead of
being ready in five Weeks, it was four Months and Come
odd Days before all Things were got together.
I T was the Beginning of Febraary, our Stile, when we
fet out from Peking; my Partner and the old Pilot had gone
exprefs back to the Port where we had firfi put in, to
dipofe of Come Goods which we had left there; and I
with a Chinefe Merchant, who I had fomen Knowledge
of at Nanquin, ard who came to Peking on his own Affairs, went to Nai i, where I bought ninety Pieces of
fine Damasks, with about two hundred Pieces of other
very fine Silks, of feveral forts, fome mix'd with Gold,
and had all thefe brought to Peking againft my Partner's Return; beides this, we bought a very large Quantity of
Raw Silk, and fome other (3oods, our Cargo amounting
in thefe Goods only, to about three thoufind five hundred
Pounds Sterling, which, together with Tea, and fome fine
Callicoes, and three Camel Loads of Nutmegs and Cloves,'
loaded in all eighteen Camels for our Share, befides thoie
we rode upon; which with two or three fpare Horfes,
and two Horfes loaded with Provifions, made us in f. ort

T i E Outfide, which the Sun fhone hot upon, was glah

'Galley-Tiles in England, all made of the fineft China, and

of Artillery  or our Engineers, with two Companes of
Miners;would not they batter it down in ten iays, that
an Army might enter in Battalia, or blow it up in the Air,
Foundation and all, that there fhould be no fign of it left?
Ay, ay, fays he. I know that. The Chinefe wanted mightily to know what I faid, and I gave him leave to tell him
a few Days after, for we was then almoff out of their
Country, and he was to leave us in a little time afterward;
but when he knew what I had faid, he was dumb all the

it was not much, only wha we call broken Head; nei
ther did I afterwards find any great Inconvenience fiom
the Blow, other than the Place wiich was Hurt, and which
was wellagain in two or three Days.
W E made no great Gain however by this Vicory, for
weloft a Camel, and gained a Horie; but that which wa
remarkable, when we came back to the Village, the Man
demanded to be paid for the Camei I difputed it, and it
was brought to a Hearing before the Chinef Judge of the
Place; that is to fay, in Englih, we went before a Juftice
-f the Peace: Give him his due, he aCted with a great deal
of Prudence and Impartiality; and having heard both Sides,
he gravely ask'd the Chinefe Man, that went with me to
buy the Camel, whofe Servant he was? I am no Servant,
fays he, but went with the Stranger: At whofe Requeft,
ihys the Juftice? At the Stranger s NRequeft, fays he  why
then, fays theJuftice, you were the Stranger's Servant for
the Time, and the Camel being deliver'd to his Servant, it
was delivered to him, and he muft pay for it.
-I coN E ES SO. the thingwas fo clear, that I had not a
Word to fiy, but admiring to fee fuch juft Reafonin.upon the Con quence, and o accurate fating the Cau.,
payd willingly for the Camel, and fent for another j but

bold in executing, brought me a Tartar's Robe or Gown
of Sheep-Skins, and a Bonnet, with a Bow and Arrow
and had provided the fame for himfelf and his Countryman, that the People, if they faw us, fhould not be able to'
determine who we were.
A L L the firit Night we fpent in mixing up fome combuftible Matter with Aqua-vite, Gun-powder, and fuch other Materials as we could get, and having a good Qeuant
tity of Tar in a little Pot, about an Hour after Night we
fet out upon our Expedition.
W E came to the Place about eleven a-Clock at Nih
and found that the People had not theleaft Jeaulo   of
Dangerattending their Idol; the Nightwas cloudy, yet the
Moon gave us Light enough to fee that theIdollood juft in
the fame Poture and Place that it did before The People
feemed to be l         at the  Reft, oaly, that in the great Hut,
or Tent, as we caU'd i;t where we faw. t  three Priefts,
who we mifook for Butchrs, we faw a   ight, and goa
ing up clofe to the toor, we heard People talking, as if
thirewere five or fix of them. we. coinluded tieforre,
that if we fet Wild-fite to the ldol, thefiMen would come
out immediately, and run up to te Place to refcue it from
the Deftruion that we intended for it, and what to do
with them we knew not    once we thought of carry
In it away and fetting Fire to it at a Dift     but
wtin we came to hadi it, we found it too bulky fot
our Carriage, o we were at a Lofs again  The feMond
Scots-m$n was for fetti   Fire to the Tent or- Hut, and
knocking the Creature tatwere  re     e w the H  d when
they



they camie out; but I could not join with that; I iwas
againit killing them, if it was poffible to be avoided: Wel
then, faid the Scts Merchant, ill tellyou what we will
do, we wit try    take them Prifoners, tie their Hands
and make them tand,:and fee their Idol defroy'd.
A s it happen'd, we had Twine or Packthread enough
about us, which  as ufed to tie our Fire-Works togher
with; fo we refolved to attaque thefe People firft, andwith
as little Noife as we could: The firft Thing we did, we
knock'd at the Door, when one of the Priets coming to
the Door, we immediately feized upon him, fiop'd his'
Mouth, and ty'd his Hands behind him, and led him to
the Idol, where we gag'd him, that he might not make a
Noife  ty'd hi&amp; Feet alfo together, and left him on the
Ground.
Tw o of us then waited at the Door, expe&amp;ing that
another would come out to fee what the matter was; but
we waited fo long till the third Man came back to us;
and then no body coming out, we knock'd again gently,
and immediately out came two more, and weerv' them
juft in the fame Manner, but was obligd to go all Wit
them, and lay them down by the Idol fome Ditnance from
one another; when goingback, we found two more were
come out to the Dor, and a third flood behind them within the Door: We iiz'd the two, and immediately ty'd
them, whei the third flepping back, and crying out, my
Scats Merchant went in afer him, and takng out a Cornofition we had made, that Would only fmoak and fRink,
e ft Fire to it, and threw it in among them; by that
time the otherr Sc m and" my Mta, thg Chare      f
the two Men already bound, and ty  tog aefo iyfthie
Arm, led them awy to the Tdol, ant lt     thim e, to
fee if their Idol wold-relie  then makiN    ' bac to
us.     -
WAEx. the uFue we had thrown in had flI'd the HUt
with Co much Smoak, tt they were almoft fifoeatd,
we then threw in a finall Leather Bag o anothe kind,
which flam'd like a Candle and followin it init e foftd
there was but four People left, who, it iem,  wre ti
Men and two Women, and, as wefupposd, h' beenabou
fome of their Diabolick Sacrifices: T'ey appar'd, in flbrt
frighted to Death, at leaft fo as to fit trembling and flupid;
and not able to fpeak neither, for the Smoak.
IN a Word, we took them, bound them as we had the
