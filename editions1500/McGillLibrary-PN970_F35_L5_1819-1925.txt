1ST W AS born of a good family, in the city of York, 
where my father settled, having gained a very 
handsome independence by trade. 

Against the prudent advice of my parents, I re- 
solved to go to sea \ and on the 1st of September, 
1651, being at Hull, I went on board the ship 
Mope, bound for London, but before the ship was 
out of the Humber, the wind began to blow, and 
the sea to rise in a most terrible manner. Having 
never been at sea before, 1 w as very sick, and 
sorely frightened. While we were tossing about 
in Yarmouth Roads, and expecting every minute 
*he ship to go to the bottom, I began to feel how 
justly 1 was punished for disobeying the advice of 
the best of parents. At length the crew took to 
their boats, and we safely reached the land.. — I 
then walked to Yarmouth, where I remained 
some days, thinking whether to return home, or 
not ; at length 1 resolved to walk to London, and 
on arriving in this city, 1 contracted an acquaint- 
ance with the master of a vessel, who had been on 
a voyage to the coast of Guinea, and was going 
again, and offered to take me free of any expense, 
with liberty to trade on my own account. This 
proved to me a disastrous voyage, for during a 
nurricane, the ship drove on the rocks, all the

crew, except myself, were drowned, but clinging 
to the rocks, 1 was saved, and having 'clambered 
over them, 1 reached the shore, and laid ine down 
to go to sleep. When 1 awoke in the morning, 
I swam to the ship, which was at no great dis- 
tance ; and to my great joy I reache-d it, and catch- 
ing hold of a rope, 1 got into the forecastle ; here 
to my surprise I found good provisions. With some 
wood I formed a raft, and having emptied some 
tubs and chests lowered them on the raft, and 
filled them with bread, Dutch cheeses, and dried 
goat's flesh. 1 also let down two fowling pieces, 
two pistols, and an old rusty sword, together wit I 
a dog. — All these. 1 edaced on the raft, and then 




made for shore, pushed the raft along with some

broken oars, until I safely landed my invaluable 
cargo. At night 1 barricadoed myself round with 
the tubs and chests, of which I made a kind of 
hut. The next day I resolved to make a second 
voyage, and again brought off from the ship some 
bags of nails and spikes, sails, bullets, small 
shot, and powder \ also, the carpenter's chest, 
two fowling" pieces, together with all the sailor's 
clothing, which, after much labour, I safely 
landed. I had now been thirteen days on shore, 
and went seriously to work, and soon built 
myself a convenient, hut, which I covered with the 
sails, supported by some poles. While 1 was 
rummaging one day, I found a few husks of corn 
in a little bag, which I shook out by the side of 
my hut : this was just before a heavy rain, aud 
m about two months afterwards, I was astonished 
and delighted to see ten or twelve ears of barley 
spring up — these I carefully preserved for seed. 
I took a walk alo^ng the island, with my dog and 
gun, when 1 knocked down a young parrot, which 
J took home alive, and learned it to talk ; my dog 
also seized a young kid — this also 1 brought home, 
and tamed. J now at my leisure, made a boar, 
and foolish-man like, put to sea in it, when I was 
soon drifted far from land. 1 now gave myself up 
fox lost, sighing after my habitation on shore

But, very fortunately, a breeze springing up, wafted 
my bo?it to the island, when 1 jumped on shore* 
and fell on my knees, returning thanks to God for 
his gracious deliverance. 1 regained my hut the 
next night, and laid myself down, and slept sound- 
ly. This ramble endeared me to my hut, ari l 1 
felt resigned to the will of Providence. One morn- 
ing, going to visit my boat, 1 was exceedingly sur- 
prised to see the print of a man's naked foot on the 




shore. 1 stood like one thundet struck ; aud in- 
stantly hastened home to more strongly fortify my 
habitation. Some short time afterwards, 1 was 
terrified in boholding the shore strewed with the 
sculls, hands and feet of human beings. 1 had 
now been on the island twenty-two years, whew

one clay I was surprised with the light of a fire 
on the shore, towards my end of the island. In 
this extremity, I went directly to my castle (as I 
called it,) pulled up the ladder, and put myself in 
the best posture of defence. In a few days after, 
I espied five canoes rowing to shore, which on 
reaching, they dragged out two miserable beings, 
one of whom they immediately knocked down, but 
the other started from them, and ran towards me. 
f confess I was horribly frightened $ however, I 
kept my station, and was without fear when 1 saw 
but three following him. 1 hastily fetched my 
gun, and clapped myself between the pursuers 
and the pursued, beckoned to him that fled, to 
come to me ; and rushing at once on the fore- 
most, knocked him down, and shot the others 
dead. The poor savage that had fled, was most 
terribly frightened at the noise of my piece, tho' 
he saw hu enemies fallen, that he stood stock- 
still, but seemed more inclined to fly from me, 
than to come forwards. However, 1 gave him 
signs of encouragement, and he came nearer,kneel- 
ing down every ten or twelve steps. On his com - 
ming close to me, he kneeled down again, and laid 
his head upon the ground, and placed my foot 
upon it. f soon began to speak to this poor crea- 
ture, and learned him to speak to me He scon 




proved a faithful servant, and I called him Friday 
(being the day on which I rescued him.) I now 
taught him to eat some kid, which he liked much 
and promised me he would not eat human flesh 
any more. He soon was capable of assisting me 
in e very tiling, and I grew very fond of him. I 
did wot fail to instruct this poor creature in the 
principles of religion and how he was to worship 
God, and he used to listen to me with the great- 
est attention. I then taught him the use of guns, 
and how to shoot with them. I gave him a knife 
and a belt, in which I put a hatchet. I now en- 
tered the 27th year of my captivity, when one 
morning, I bid Friday go to the sea shore, to see 
if he .could find a turtle, when he came running

back, telling me there was a boat coining \& 
them. 1 soon espied an English ship laying at 
anchor, and hastened to the beach, where 1 found 
the ship's boat, the crew having left it with three 
men bound. 1 spoke to one, and he told me he 
was the captain of the ship, that his men had mu- 
tinied, and had brought him and the two others 
there, either to kill them, or leave them on that 
island. 1 soon liberated them, and made myself 
known, when it was agreed to kill or secure that 
part of the crew that came with the boat. The 
next dav another boat's crew came in search of 
their companions ; these were also conquered. It 
was then agreed between me and the captain, that 
one party should go and take possession of the 
vessel. When 1 learned they had taken the ship, 
and saw my deliverance thus put into my hands, 
1 was ready to sink with joy. As some of the re- 
bellious crew wished to remain on the island, 1 
acceded to their request ; and having made them 
acquainted with every particular relative to the 
island, 1 went on board, taking Friday with me. 
Thus 1 left the island, after being on it twenty- 
eight years. On my arrival in England, nearly 
all my relations were dead. finis.
