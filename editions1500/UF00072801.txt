LIFE AND ADVENTURES

OF

ROBINSON CRUSOE.

\

I WAS born in the year 1632, in the city of York, of a goon
family though not 0 that country, my father being a foreign-
er of liremen, who settled first at Hull: he got a good estate
h)", merchandise, and leaving off his trade, lived afterwards at

ork; from whence he had married my mother, whose rela-
tions were named Robinson, a very ood family in that couu~
try, and from whom I was called R0 inson Kreutznaer; but,
by the usual corruption of words in England, we are now
called, nay we call ourselves, and write our name, Crusoe; and
so my companions always called me.

I had two elder brothers, one of whom was lieutenant-colo-
nel to an English regiment of foot in Flanders, formerl oom-
manded by t e famous Colonel Lookhurt, and was kille at the
battle near Dunkirk against the Spaniards. What became of
my second brother I never knew, any more than my father or
mother did know what was become of me.

Being the third son of the family, and not bred to any trade,
my head began to be filled very early with rambling thoughts:
my father, who was very ancient, had given me a competent
share of learning, as far as houseeducat'ion and a country free-
school generally go, and designed me for the law; but I would
be satisfied with iiothiii r but going to sea; and my inclination
to this led me so strong 3' a ainsfilie will, nay, the commands
of my father, and against afi the entreaties and persuasions of
my mother and other friends, that there seemed to be some-
thing fatal in that plropension of nature, tending directly to the
life of misery whic was to befall me.

My father, a wise and rave man, gave me serious and ex-
cellent counsel against w at he foresaw was my design. He
called me one morning into his chamber, where he was con-
fined b the gout, and expOstulated very warmly with me
upon t is subject: he asked me what reasons, more than a
mere wandering inclination, I had for leaviii my father's
house and my native countrv, where I might well intro-
duced, and had a prospect of raising my fortune by a plica-
tion and industry, with a life of ease and pleasure. e told
me it was for .men of desperate fortunes on one hand, or of as-
piring, superior fortunes on the other, who went abroad upon
adventures, to rise by enterprise, and make themselves famous
in under ' s of a nature out of the common road; that these
things , I either too far above me, ortoo far below me;
that minetwas the middle state, or what might be called the
upper station of low life, which he had found, by long expe-
rience, was the best state in the world, the most suited-10
human happiness, not espom to the miseries and hardshi
the labor and sufferings the mechanic part ot'mankmd,
not embarrassed with the pride lining, ambition, and envy
of the upper part of mankind. I'Ie to! me 1 might judged
the hlp iness of this state by one thing, viz. that this was the
state life which all other people envied; that kings have
frequent; lamenwd the miserable consequences of bemg born
to ings, and wish they had been laced in the'middb
of , twoextremes,betweenthe meanan the great; that'the
'nirseman gave his testimonyto this,asthe jolt standardd'
trufi felictty, when he prayed to have neither poverty no:
nc es. '

He bid me observe it, and I should always find, that the ca-
lamities of life were shared among the upper and lower part
oi mankind; but that the middle station had the fewest disas-
ters, and was not exposed to so many vicissitudes as the higher
or lower tart of mankind; nay, they were not subjected to
so many 'stempers and uneasinesses, either of body or mind,
as those were, who, by vicious living, luxury, and extravas
gances, on one hand, or by hard labor, want of necessaries,
and mean and insulficient diet, on the other hand, hrin disc
tempers upon themselves by the natural consequences 0 their
way of living; that the middle station oflil'e was calculated for
all kind of virtues and all kind ol'enjoyments; that peace and
plenty were the .handmnids of a middle fortune; that term
gerance, moderation, quietness, health, society, all agreeable

iversions, and all destrable pleasures, were the blessings at-
tending the middle statwn of life; that this way men went si-
lently and smoothly through the world, and comfortably out
of it not embarrassed with the labors of the hands or of the
head, not sold to the life of slavery for daily bread, or harassed
with wer flexed circumstances, which rob the soul of peace,
and the y of rest; not enraged with the passion of envy, or
secret burning lust of ambition for rreat thin s; but, in easy
circumstances, sliding gently throu fth the wor d, and sensibly
tasting the sweets of livm , withoutt 1e bitter, feeling that they
are happy, and learning yevery day's experience to know it
more sensibly.

After this, he pressed me earnestly, and in the most afi'ec-L
tio'nate manner, not to play the young man, not to preci itate
myself into miseries which nature, and the station of life was

V born in, seemed to have provided against; that I was under no
necessity of seeking my bread; that he would do wellrfor me,
and endeavor to enter me fairly into the station of file whichfi
he had been just recommendin to me; and that if I w '

the wofid. it must be my mere

  
 

my easy and happy in
fault that must hinder it; and that he should have nothing to
answer for, having thus discharged his duty in warning_me
against measures which he knew would be to my hurt; in a
word, that as he would do i'er kind thin s for me if I would
stay and settle at home as he irected', so would not have so
much hand in my misfortunes, as to give me any encour
ment to 'go away; and, to close all, he told me I had my el er
brother _ or an example, to whom he had used the same earnest
persuas'ions to keep him from going into the Low Country
wars, hut could not prevail, his you desires prompting him
to run into the army, where he was ki ed; and though he said
he would not cease to pray for me, yet he would venture to
say to me, that if I did take this foolish step, God would not
bless me, and I would have leisure herealter to reflect upon
having neglected his counsel; when'there might be- none to
assist in my recovery. . '

I observed In this as! part of his discourse, which was truly
prophetic though I suppose my father did not know it to be-
so himself; I say, I observed the tears run down his face very
plentiw, and especially when he spoke of my brother who
was It ; and' that when he spoke of my having leisure to
re nt, and none to assist me, he was so moved, that he broke
o the discourse, and told me, his heart was so- full he could'
say no more to me. . _ _

was Sincerely affected With this discourse, as indeed who
could be otherwrse'l and I resolved not to think of ingr
abroad any more, but to settle at home according to my fat er's
desire. But, alas! a few days wore it all off; and, in short, to
prevent any of my father's further importunities. in a few weeks
after I resolved to run quite away fi'om him. However, I did
not act so hastily, neither, as my first heat of resolution
rompted, but I took or mother, at a time when I thought
er a little pleasanter ordinary, and told her, that my
A hts were so entirely bent upon seein the world, that
I, d never settle to any thing with reso tion enough to
go'thnugh with it, and my fithei: had better give'me hi.I cow-
sent, than force me to go without it; that I was now eighteen
years old, which was too late to go up rentice to a trade, or
clerk to an attorney; that I was sure, IF I did, I should never
serve out my time, and I should certainly run away from my
master before my time was out, and go to sea; and if she
would speak to my father'to let me go one voya e abroad, if I
came home again, and did not like it, I woul go no more,
and I would promise, by a double diligence, to recover that
time I had lost. '

This put in mother into a great passion: she told me she
knew it woul be to no purpose to speak to my father upon
any such subject; that he knew too_ well what was my interest
to give his consent to any such thing so much for m hurt;
an that she wondered howl could think of any sue 1 thin
after such a discourse as I had had with my father, and suc i
kind and tender expressions as she knew my father had used
to me; and that, in short, if I would ruin myself, there was no
help for me; but I mi ht depend I should never have their
consent to it; that for ier part she would not have so much
hand in my destruction; and I should never have it to say,
that my mother was willing when my father was not.

Though my mother refused to move it to my father, yet, as
I have heard afterwards, she reported all the discourse to him
and that my father, alter showmg a great concern at it, sai
to her with a si h, "That boy might be liapp if he would
stay at home; at if he goes abroad, he Wll be the most
miserable wretch that was ever born; I can give no con-
sent to it." .

It was not till almost a year after this that I broke loose
though, in the mean time, I continued obstinately deaf to all
proposals of settling to business, and frequently expostulating
with my father and mother about their being so positively de-
termined against what they knew my inclinations prompted
me to. But being one da at Hull, where I went casually,
and without any purpose 0 makin an elopement at thatafme;
but, I say, being there, and one o my companions then gomg
oy sea to London, in his father's ship, and prompting me to
go with them, with the common allurement of sea-faring men,
viz. that it should cost me nothing for my pass. we, I consulted
neither father or mother any more, not so mudli as sent them
word of it ; but leaving them to hear of it as they might, with-
out askin'r God's blessmg, or my father's, without any consid-
eration of. circumstances or consequences, and in an ill hour.
God knows, on the first of Se tember, 1651, I Went on board
a ship bound for London. ever any young adventurer's
misfortunes, .I believe, began sooner, or continued lon er than
mine. The ship was no sooner gotten out of the Hum r, but
the wind began to blow, and the waves to rise in a most fright-
ful manner; and, as I had never been at sea before, I was
most inexpressibly sick in body, and terrified in mind. I be-
gan now seriously to reflect upon what I had done, and how
iustl I was overtaken by the judgment of Heaven tbr wick-
edly lgaving my father's house, and abandoning: my duty. All
. the good counsel of my parents, my father's tears and my
mother's entreaties, came now fresh into my mind; and my
conscience, which was not yet come to the pitch of hardness
to which it has been since, reproached me with the contempt
of advice, and the breach of my duty to God and my father.
All this while the storm increased, and the sea, which I had
never been upon before, went very high, though nothin like
what I have seen many time's since; no, nor like what Isa"-
a few days alter: but it was enough to affect me then, who
was but a oung sailor, and had never known an thing of the
matter. expected every wave would have sw lowe us up,
and that .every time the ship fell down, as I thought, in the
trough or hollow of the sea, we should never rise more; and in
this ny of mind I made many vows and resolutions, that if
it we d please God here to spare my life this one voyage, if
ever I Eat once my foot upon dry land again, I would go di-
rectly ome to my father, and never set it into a ship again
whiIrI-lived; that I would take his advice, and never run mvo
Ielf into such miseries as these any more. New I saw plainly
the oodness of ' observations about the middle station of
life,ghow easy, l' v coinliirtably he had lived all his da 's, and
never had been exposed to tcin )USIS at sea, or tron iles on
shore; and I resolved that l ivoul , like a true reprinting prod-
igal, go home to my father.

These wise and sober thoughts continued during the storm
and, indeed, seine time after; but the next day, as the wind
was abated, and the sea calmer, I began to be a little innred
to it: however, I was very grave for all that day, being also a
little sea-sick still; but towards night the weather cleared it i,
the wind was uite over, and a Cliarlilln" fine evening followed;
the sun went own perfectly clear, and, rose so the next moriiv
ingi and having little or no wind and a smooth sea, the sun
shining upon it, the Sight was, as i thought, the most delight-
Yul that I ever saw.

I had slept well in the night, and was now no more sea-sick,
but very cheerful, looking with wonder upon the sea, that was
so rough and terrible the day before, and could be so calm
and so pleasant in a little time after. And now, lest my rood
resolutions should continue, my companion, who had, in cod,
enticed me away, came to me and said, " Well, Bob," clap--
ping me on .the shoulder, "how do you do after it 'I l warrant
you were frightened, wa'n't you, last night, when it blew but
a cap-full oi wind?".---"A ca i-l'ull do you call it?" said I:
" it was a terrible storm."----" 1i storm, you fool you," replied
he," do you call that a storm? why, it was nothing at all ' give
us but a good ship and sea-room, and we think nothing oi" such
a squall of wind as that' but ou're but a fresh-water sailor,
Bob, Come, let us mahe a liowl of punch, and we'll for et
all that; do you see what charming weather it is now'?" '0
hiake short this sad art of my story, we went the old way of
trill sailors; the punc was made, and I was made drunk with
It; and in that one night's wickedness I drowned all in re-
pentance, all m reflections upon my past conduct, an all
my resolutions or my future. In a word, as the sea was re-
turned to its smoothness of surface and settled calmness by
the abatement of that storm, 50, the hurry of my thou hts being
over, my fears and apprehensions of being sw owed up
by the sea bcin r forgotten and the current of my former de-
sires returned entirel ' orgot the vows and promises that I
made in my distress. found, indeed, some intervals of re-
flection; and serious thoughts did, as it were endeavor to
return again sometimes; but I shook them 0 , and roused
myself from them as it were from a distemper, and applyin
myself to drinkin and company, soon mastered the return 0
those fits, for so called them; and I had in five or six days
got as complete a victory over conscience, as any oung
ellow, that resolved not to be troubled with it could esire:
but I was to have another trial for it still; and Providence, as
in such cases generally it does, resolved to leave me entirely
without excuse; for if I would not take this for a deliverance
the next was to be such a one as the worst and most hardened
wretch among us would confess both the danger and the
mercy of.

The sixth day of our being at sea, we came into Yarmouth
Roads; the wmd having been contrary, and the weather calm,
we had made but little way since the storm. Here we were
obliged to come to anchor, and here we lay, the wind contin-
uing contrary, viz. at south-west, for seven or eight days,
durm which time a great many ships from Newcastle came
intot e same roads, as the common harbor where the ships
mi ht wait for a wind for the River.

e had not, however, rid here so lon , but should have
tided it up the river, but that the wind bew too fresh; and,
after we had lain four or five days, blew vergohard. However,
the roads being reckoned as good as a har r, the anchorage
good, and our ground tackle very strong, our men were uni
concerned, and not in the least apprehensive of dan r, but
spent the time in rest and mirth, after the manner of e sea;
but the eighth day in the morning the Wind increased and we
had all hands at work to strike our top-masts and malie every
thing snug and close. that the ship might ri e as easy as pos-l3

sible. By noon the sea went very high indeed, and our ship
rode forecastle in, shipeied several seas, and we thought once
or twice our anchor ha come home; upon which our master
ordered out the sheet anchor; so that we rode with two an-
chors ahead, and the cables veered out to the better end.

By this time it blew a terrible storm indeed; and now I be-
gan to see terror and amazement in the faces even of the sea-
men themselves. The master though vigilant in the business
of preserving the ship, yet as he went in and out of his cabin
by me,I could hear him softly sa to himself several times
" Lord, he merciful to us! we she] be all lost; we shall be all
undone!" and the like. During these first hurries I was
stupid, lving still in my cabin, which was in the steer e, and
cannot describe my temper: I could ill reassume e first

enitence which I had so apparently trampled upon, and
liardened myself against: I thought the bitterness of death
had been past, and that this would be nothin like the first;
but when the master himself came by me, as I said just now,
and said we should be all lost, I was dreadfully frighted: I got
up out of my cabin, and looked out; but such a dismal sight
I never saw; the sea went mountains high,'and broke upon
us every three or four minutes: when I could look about, I
could see nothing but distress around us: two ships that rid
near us, we found, had cut their masts by the board, hein'r
deep laden; and our men cried out, that a ship which ri
about a mile ahead of us was foundered. Two more ships,
being driven from their anchors, were run out of the roads to
sea, at all adventures, and that with not a must standing.
The light ships fared the best, as not so much laboring m the
sea; but two or three of them drove, and came close .by us.
running away with only their spritsail out before the Wind.

. Towards evening, the mate and boatswain begged the mas-
ter of our ship to et them cut away the fore-mast, which he
was very unwnlling to do; but the boatswain protesting to him
that if he did not, the ship would founder, he consented; an
when they had cut away the foremast, the mam-mast stood soROBINSU.' cttUs'OL. 15

her away also, and make a clear deck.

Any one may judge what a condition I must be in at all
this, who was but a young sailor and who had been in such
alright before at but a httle. llut it I can express at this
distance the thou rhts that I had about me at that time, I was
in tenlbld more orror of mind upon account of my former
convictions, and the having returned from them to theresolu-
tions I had wickedly taken at first, than I was at death itsel"?
and these, added to the terror of the storm, put me in such
condition, that I can by no words describe'it._ But the wars.
was not come yet; the storm continued with such fury; that

he seamen themselves acknowledged they had never known I
worse. We had a good ship, but she was deep laden, and
wallowed in the sea, that the seamen every now and then cried
out, she would founder. It was my advantage in ohe res 'ct,
that I did not know what they meant by founder, till iu-
quired. However, the storm was so violent, that I saw what

middle of the night, and under all t Ie rest of our distresses
one of the men that had been down on Sims to see, cric
out, we had sprun a leak; another sai , re was four foot
water in the hold. hen all hands were called to the pump.
At that very word, my he irt, as I thought, died within me, and
l fell backwards upon the side of my bed, where I sat, intothe

cabin. However, the men roused me, and told me, that I, III; -' '
P

was able to do nothing before, was as well able to'pum

another; at which I stirred up, and went to flu: ump, and
worked very heartil . While this was doing,' firinaater,
seeing some light col iers, who, not able to ride ont'thestorm,
were obliged to slip and run away to sea, and would'not come
near us, ordered us to fire a gun as a signal of distress. I
who k ew nothing what that meant, was so surprlsd, that'l
th the ship had broke, or some dreadful thing had imp:
pened. In a word, I was so surprised, that I fell down in a
swoon. As this was a time when every body had his own hi?!
to think of, nobody minded me, or what was become of me;
but another man stepped up to the pump; and, thrusting me
aside with his foot let me he, thinking I ad been dead; and
It was a great while before I came to myself _

We worked on; but the water increasin in the hold, It was
apparent that the shl'p would founder; an thouoh the storm
began to abate a lit e, yet as it was not possilfie she 90qu
swrm till we might run Into a port, so the master continued
firing guns for help; and a light ship, who had rid it out just
ahead of us, ventured a boat out to help us. It was with the
utmost hazard the boat came near us; but it was impossible
for us to get on board, or for the boat to lie near the ship's side,
till at last, the men rowing very heartily, and venturing their
lives to save ours, our men cast them a rope over the stem
with a buoy to it and then veered it out a teat length, which
they, after great labor and hazard, took hold of, and we hauled
them close under our stern, and got all into their boat. It was
to.no purpose for them or us, after we were in the boat to
think of reaching to their own ship' so all agreed to let er
drive, and only to pull her in towar s shore as much as we
could; and our master promised them, that if .the boat was
staved upon shore, he would make it good to their master; so,
partly rownif and partly driving, our boat went awa to the
northward, oping towards the s ore almost as far as mter~
ton Ness.

We were not much more than a uarter of an hour out of
our ship but we saw her sink, and en I understood for the
first time what was meant by a ship tbundenng In the sea. I
must acknowledge I had hardly eyes to look up when the-ea-
men told me she was sinking' for from that moment they
rather put me Into the boat, than that I might be said to go
in_: my heart was, as it were, dead Within me, artly mth
fnght, partly wrth horror of nnnd, and the thong ta of what
was yet before me. ,
While we were in this condition, the men yet laborin at
the oar to bring the boat near the shore, we could see (w en,
our boat mounting the waves, we were able to see the shore)
a great many people running along the strand to assist us
when we should come near; but we made but slow way to-
wards the shore; nor were we able to'reach it, till, being past
the light-house at Winterten, the shore falls; oll' to the west-
ward, towards Cromer, and so the land broke off a little the
violence of the wind. Here we got in and, though not with-
out much diflicultv, got all sale on s ore, and walked after>>
wards on foot to Yarmouth, where, as unfortunate men, we
were used with great humanity, as well by the magistrates of
the town, who assigned as good quarters, as by particular
merchants and owners of shi s, and had moneiy given us
sufiicient to carry us either to ondon or back to "lull, as we
thought lit.

Had I now had the sense to have gone back to Hull, and
have gone home, I had been hap )y, and my father, an emblem
of our blessed Savier's parable had even killed the famed calf
for me; for hearing the ship l went away in was cast away
in Yarmouth Roads, it was a great while before he had any as
surance that I was not drowned. .

But my ill fate pushed me on now with an obstinaey that
nothing could resist; and though I had several times loud calls
from my reason, and my more com osed' judgment, to go
home, yet I had no power to do it. know not what to call
this, nor will I urge that it is a secret overruling decree hat
hurries us on to be the instruments of our own destfiic- ion,
even though it be before us, and that we rush u on it With our
eycgopen. Certainly, nothing but some sue decreei'lh un-
avoidable misery attending, and which it was impossible for
me to escape, could have pushed me forward aiust the cairn
masonings and rsuasrons of my most reti thoughts, and
against two sue Visible yrstrnctxdns 'as I had met wrth in my
first attempt. ' '

My comradze, who had helped to harden me betbre, and who _18 ROBINSON causes.

was the master's son, was now less forward than 1. The first
time he spoke to me after we were at Yarmouth, which was
not till two or three days, for we were separated in the town
to several quarters; I say, the first time he saw me, it ap-
peared his tone was altered, and, looking very melancholy, and
shaking his head, asked me how I did, and telling his father
who I was, and how I had come this voyage only for a trial,
in order to go farther abroad: his father turning,r to me with a
very grave and concerned tone, " Young man," says he,
" you ought never to go to sea any more; you ought to take
this for a plain and visible token that you are not to be a sea-
faring man."--" Why, sir," said I, "will you go to sea no
more?"--" That is another case," said he; " it is my calling,
and therefore my duty; but as you made this voyage for a
trial, you see what a taste Heaven has given you of what you
are to expect if you persist. Perha )5 this has all befallen us
on your account, like Jonah in the 5 ip of 'l'arshish. Pray,"
continues he, " what are you; and on what account did you
go to sea?" Upon that I told him some of my story; at the
end of which he burst out with a strange kind of passion;
" What had I done," says he, " that such an unhappy wretch
should come into my ship'! I would not set my toot in the
same ship with thee again for a thousand pounds." This, in-
deed, was, as I said, an excursion of his spirits, which were
yet agitated by the sense of his lass, and was farther than he
could have authority to go. However, he afterwards talked
very gravel to me, exhorting me to trio back to my father, and
not tempt rovidence to my ruin; d me I might see a vis-
ible hand of Heaven ainst me. " And young man," said
he, " depend upon it, i you do not go back wherever you; go,
you will meet with nothing but disasters an disappointments,
till 'our father's words are fulfilled upon you."

e parted soon after; for I made him little answer, and 1
saw him no more: which way he w nt I know not. As for
me, having some money in my pock t, I travelled to London
by land; and there, as well as on the road, had many strug-
gles with myself, what course of life I should take, and
whether I should go home, or go to sea.

As to going home, shame opposed the best notions that offer-
ed to my thoughts; and it immediately occurred to me how I
should be laughed at amour the neirhbors, and should be
ashamed to see, not my fat net and ther only, but even
every body else; from whence I have since often observed,
how incongruous and irrational the common temper of man-
kind is especially of youth, to that reason which ought to
guide t em in such cases, viz. that they are not ashamu! to
sin, and yet are ashamed to repent; nor ashamed of the action
for which they ought justly to be esteemed fools, but are
ashamed of the returning, which only can make them be es-
teemed wise men.

In this state of life, however, I remained some time, uncer-
tain what measures to take, and what course of life to lead.
An irresistible reluctiuice continued to oing home; and as I
staid awhile, the remembrance of the istress I had been in
wore off; and as that abated, the little notion I had in my de-
sires to a return wore of? with it, till at last I quite laid aside
the thoughts of it, and looked out for a voyage.

That evil influence which carried me first away from my

father's house, that hurried me into the wild and indigeeted f i
notion of raising my fortune; and that impressed those con- 1"

ceits so forcibl upon me, as to make me deaf to all good ad-
vice, and to e entreaties and even the commands of my
father; I say the same i nee, whatever it was, presented
the most unfortunate of enterprises _to my new; and-I
went on board a vessel bound to the coastof Africa; or, uvour
sailors vulgarly call it, a voyage to Guinea. 9"

It was my great misfortune that In all these adventures I
did not ship at self as a sailor- whereby, though I might in-
deed have wor ed a little har er than ordinary, yet at the
same time I had learnt the duty and office of a foremast-man;
and in time might have qualified myself for a mate or lieuten-
ant, ifnot for a master. But as it was always my fate to

a;go nonmson causes.

choose for the worse, so I did here; for, having moneyr in my
pocket, and good clothes upon my back, I would always go
on board in t e habit of a entleman; and so I neither had
any business in the ship or earnt to do any.

It was my lot first 0! all to fall into pretty good company In
London, which does not always happen to such loose and un-
guided young fellows as I then was; the devil generally not
omitting to lav some snare for them very early : but it was not
so with me. I first fell acquainted with the master of a shi
who had been on the coast of Guinea; and who, having ha
very good success there, was resolved to go again; and who,
taking a fancy to my conversation, which was not at all dis-
agreeable at that time, hearintr me say I had a mind to see the
world, told me if I would go the voyage with him, I should be
at no ex ense; I should be his messmate and his companion;
and if IP could carry any thing with me, 1 should have all the
advantage of it that the trade would admit; and perhaps I:
might meet with some encouragement.

embraced the offer; and entering into a strict friendship
with this captain, who was an honest and plain-dealing man,
I went the voy e with him, and carried a small adventure
with me, which, y the disinterested honesty of my friend the
captain, I increased very considerably; for I carried about
PS40 in such toys and trifies as the captain directed me to buy.
This PS40 I had mustered together b the assistance of some
of my relations whom I correspond with, and who, I believe,
gt a father, or- at least my moth'to contribute so much as

at my first adventure.

This was the only'voyage in which I may say I was success--
ful in all my adventures, and which I owe to the integrity and
honesty of my friend the captain; under whom also I got a
competent knowled of the mathematics and the rules of
navigation, learnt w to keep an account of the ship's
course, take an observation, and, in short to understand some
things that were needt'ul to be understood, by a sailor; for, as
he took delight to. instruct me,l took delight to learn; and,in

'-nornxson causon. 21

a word, this voyage made me both a sailor and a merchant;
for] brought home five pounds nine ounces of gold-dust for
my adventure, which yielded me, in London, at my return, al-
most PS300; and this tilled me with those aspiring thoughts
which have so completed my ruin.

Yet even in this voyage I had my midbrtunes too; particu~
larly that I was continually sick, being thrown into a vioient
calenture by the excessive heat of the climate; our principal
trading being upon the coast, from the latitude of 15 degrees
north even to the line itself.

[was now set up for a Guinea trader; and my friend, to
my great misfortune, dying soon after his arrival, I resolved
to go the same voyage arrain; and I embarked in the same
vessel with one who was Tris mate in his former voyage, and
had now got the command of the ship. This was the unhap-
piest voyage that ever man made; for though I did not carry
quite 4:100 of my new-gained wealth, so that I had PS200 left,
and which I lodged With my friend's widow, who was very
just to me, yet I fell into terrible misfortunes in this voyage;
and the first was this, viz. our ship, making her course towards
the Canary Islands, or rather between these islands and the
African shore, was surprised, in the gray of the morning, by a
Turkish rover, of Sallee, who gave chase to us with all the
sail she could make. We crowded also as much canvass as
our yards would spread,or our masts carry, to have got clear;
but finding,r the pirate ained upon us, and would certainly
come up with us in a." ew ours, we prepared to fight; our
ship having twelve guns, a the rover ei hteen. About three
in the afternoon, he came up with us, an bringing to, by mis-
take, just athwart our uarter, instead of athwart our stern, as
he intended, we broug t eight of our guns to bear on that
,side, and poured in a broadside upon him, which made him
sheer oft~ again, after returning our fire, and pouring in also
his small-shot from near 200 men, which he had on board.
However we had not a man touched, all our men keeping
close. lie prepared to attack us again, and we to defend our-
selves; but laying us on board, the next time, upon our othet
guarter, he entered sixt men upon our decks, who immeo

iately fell to cuttin'r an hackin the sails and rigging. We
Plied them with sma --shot, half-pi e_s, powder-chests, and such
ike, and cleared our deck of them twice. However, to cut
short this melanchol' part of our story, our shi being dis-
abled, and three of our men killed and eight woun ed, we were
obliged to yield, and were carried all prisoners into Sallee, a
port belongin to the Moors.

The usage had there was not so dreadful as at first 1 ap-
prehended; nor was I carried up the country to the emperor's
court, as the rest of our men were, but was ke t by the cap-
tain of the rover as his pro )er prize, and made iis slave, being
young and nimble, and fit or his business. At this surprising
change of my circumstances, from a merchant to a miserable
slave, l was perfectly overwhelmed; and now I looked back
upon m father's prophetic discourse to me, that I should be
miserab e, and have none to relieve me which I thought was
now so effectually brought to ass, that could not be worse;
that now the hand of Heaven ad overtaken me and I was un-
done without redemption; but, alas!_ this was but a taste of
the misery I was to go through, as Will appear in the sequel
of this story.

As my new patron, or master, had taken me home to his
house, so I was in ho s that he would take me with him when
he went to sea again, lieviqg that it would some tlme or other
be his fate to be taken by a Spanimrgortuguese man of war;
and that then I should be set atli y; But this ho of mine
was soon taken away; for when he went to sea, he efi me on
shore to look after his little garden and do the common drudg-
ery of slaves about his house; an when he came home again
fiomlhis cruise, he ordered me to lie in the cabin to look the:
t e s 1 .

Herepl meditated nothing but my escape, and what method
I might take to effect it, but found no way that had the least
probability in it: noduug presented to make the supposition
of it rational; for I had nobody to communicate it to that would
embark with me, no lhllow--slave, no Englishman, Irishman,
or Scotehman there but myself; so that lbr two years, though
I otten pleased myself with the imagination, yet I never had
the least encouraging prospect ot'pnttiug it in practice.

After about two years, an odd circumstance presented itself,
which put the old thought of making some attempt for my
liberty again in my head. My patron lyinr at home longer
than usual without fitting out his shi l, whic i, as I heard, was
for want of money, he used constant y, once or twice a week,
sometimes ottener, il' the weather was fair, to take the ship's
pinnaco, and go out into the road a-lishing ; and as he always
took me and a young Moresco with him to row the boat, we
made him very merry, and I proved very (lexterous in catch-
ing fish; insomuch that sometimes he would send me With a
Moor, one of his kinsmen, and the youth of Moresco, as they
called him, to catch a dish of fish for him.

I t happened one time, that going a-tishing in a stark calm
morning, a toy,- rose so thick, that, though we were not half a
league from the shore, we lost sight of it; and, rowin we knew
not whither or which way, we labored all day, and a?! the next
night; and when the morning came, we found we had pulled
oil' to sea instead of pulling in for the shore; and that we were
at. least two leagues from the shore: however we got well in
again, though with a rent deal of labor,'and some danger;
for the wind began to )low pretty fresh in the morning; but
particularly we were all ver hungry.

But our patron, warned this disaster, resolved to take
more care of himself for the fixture; and having lying by him
the long-boat of our English ship he had taken, he resolved he
would not go a-fishing any more without a compass and some
provision: so he ordered the carpenter of his ship, who also
was an English slave, to build a little state-room, or cabin, in
the middle of the long-boat, like that of a barge, With a place
to stand behind it to steer and haul home the mam-sheet; and
room before for a hand or two to stand and work the sails: she
sailed with what we call a shoulder of mutton sail; and the
boom gibbed over the top of the cabin, which lay very snug
and low, and hid in it room for him to lie, with a slave or two,
and a table to eat on, with some small lockers to put in some
battles of such liquor as he thought fit to drink; and particu-
lLI'l ' his bread, rice, and coll'ee.

\i'e went frequently out with this boat a-fishing, and as l
was most dexterous to catch fish for him, he never went with
out me. It happened that he had appointed to go out in this
boat, either for pleasure or for fish, With two or three Moors
of'some distinction in that place, and for whom he had provi-
. ded extraordinarily, and had therefore sent on board the boat
over-ni ht a larger store of provisions than ordinary; and had
ibrderedg me to get ready three fuzees with powder and shot,
which were on board his ship; for that they designed some
sport of fowlmg as well as lishin .

[got all things ready as he rad directed, and waited the
next morning with the boat washed clean, her ensign and
pendants out, and every thing to accommodate his guests;
when, by and by, my patron came on board alone, and told me
his guests had put ofl' going, upon seine business that fell out,
and ordered me, with the man and boy, as usual, to out
with the boat and cateh them some fish, for that his riends
Were to sup at his house; and commanded that as soon as I
got some fish I should bring it home to his house; all which 1
pre ared to do.

' his moment my former notions of deliverance darted into
my thoughts, for now 1 found I was like to have a little ship at
my command; and my master bein gone, 1 prepared to fur-
nish myself, not for fishing business, at for a voyage; though
I knew not, neither did 1 so much as consider, whither 1
should steer; for any where, to get out of that place, was

my wag. _

M rst contrlvance was to make a pretence to speak to
this car, to get something for our subststence on board; for
I told him we must not presume to eat of our patron's bread:

a ,aomnson Causes. 25

he said, that was true; so he brought a lar e basket of task
or biscuit of their kind, and three jars' wit 1 fresh water, into
the boat. I knew where my patron's case of bottles stood,
which, it was evident by the make, were taken out of some
English prize, and I conveyed them into the boat while the
Moor was on shore, as if they had been there beibre for our
master: I conveyed also a great lump of bees-wax into the
boat, which weighed above half a hundred weight, with a par-
eel of twine or thread, a hatchet, a saw, and a hammer, all
which were of great use to us afterwards, especially the wax
to make candles. Another trick I tried upon him, which he
innocently came into also: his name was Ismael, whom the
call Muley, or Moley; so I called him; " Moley," said ,
"our patron's'guns are on board the boat; can you not get a.'
little powder and shot? it may be we may kill some alcamies
(a fowl like our curlews) for ourselves, for I know he keeps
the gunner's stores in the ship."----" Yes," says he, " I'll bring
some;" and accordingly he brought a great leather pouch,
which held about a pound and a half of powder, or rather
more; and another wrth shot, that had five or six pounds, with
some bullets, and put all into the boat: at the same time I had
found some owder of my master's in the great cabin, with
which I lille one of the large bottles in the case, which was
almost empty, pourin what was in it into another; and thus
furnished with every t ing needful, we sailed out of the port
to fish. The castle, which is at the entrance of the port,
knew who we were, and took no notice of us: and we were
not above a mile out of the ort before we hauled in our sail,
and set us down to fish. he wind blew from the N.N.E.
which was contrary to my desire; for had it blown southerly,
{chad been sure to have made the coast of Spain, and at least
reached to the bay of Cadiz; but my resolutions were, blow
which way it would, I would be gone from that horrid pla'ce
where I was, and leave the rest to fate.

After we had fished some time and catched nothing, for
when I had fish on my hook {would not pull them up, that he

might not see them, I said to the Moor, "This will not do;
our master Will not be thus served; we must stand farther off."
He, thinking no harm, agreed, and, being in the head of the
boat, set the sails; and as I had the helm, I run the boat out
near a league farther, and then brought her to as if I would
fish; when, giving the boy the helm, I stepped forward to'
where the Moor was, and making as if I stooped for something
behind him,I took him by sur rise with my arm under his
waist, and tossed him clear over ard into the sea. He rose
immediately, for he swam like a cork and called tome, begged
to be taken in, told me he would go all over the world with me.
He swam so strong after the boat, that he would have reached
me ver quickly, there bein but little wind; upon which I
step into the cabin, and etching one of the fouling-pieces,
I presented it at him, and told him, I had done him no hurt,
and if he would be quiet, I would do him none 2 "But," said I,
" you swim well enough to reach to the shore, and the sea is
calm; make the best of your way to shore, and I will do you
no harm; but If you come near the boat I'll shoot you through
the head, for I am resolved to have my iberty-z" so he turned
himself about, and swam for the shore, and I make no doubt
but he reached it with ease, for he was an excellent swimmer.-

I could have been content to have taken this Moor with me,
and have drowned the boy, but there was no venturin" to
trust him. When he ,was one,I turned-5&1 the boy, whom
they called Xury, and sai to him, "Xury, if you Will be'
faithful to me, I'll make you a great man; but if you will not
stroke your face to be true to me," that is, swear by Mahomct
and his father's beard, " I must throw you into the sea too."
The boy smiled in my face, and spoke so innocently, that I
could not mistrust him; and swore to be faithful to me, and go
all over the World with me.

While I was in view of the Moor that was swimming, I stood
out directly to sea with the boat, rather stretching to wind-
ward that they might think me one towards the Straits'
mouth (as indeed any one With been in their wits must

have been supposed to do); for who would have supposed we
were sailed on to the southward to the truly Barbarian coast,
where whole nations of Negroes were sure to surround us with
the canoes, and destroy us; where we could never once go on
shore but we should be devoured by savage beasts, or more
merciless savages of human kind? .

B as soon as it rew dusk in the evening, I changed my
cou , and steeredg directly south and by east, bendm my
course a little toward the east, that I might keep in with the
shore; and having a fair, fresh "ale of wind, and a smooth,

uiet sea I made such sail that 1deg believe by the next day at

ree o'clock in the afternoon, when I first made the land, I
could not be less than 150 miles south of Sallee; quite beyond
the Emperor of Morocco's dominions, or indeed of any other
kincr thereabout, for we saw no 0 le. '

fet such was the fright I liadpialgen at the Moors, and the
dreadful apprehensions I had of falling into their hands, that .
I would not stop, or go on shore, or come to an anchor; the
wind continuing fair till I had sailed in that manner five days;
and then the Wind shifting to the southward, I concluded also
that if any of our vessels were in chase of me, they also would
now give over; so I ventured to make to the coast, and come
to an anchor in the mouth of a little river, I knew not what, or
where; neither what latitude, what countrygwhat nation, or
what river: I neither saw, or desired to seeslny people; the
principal thing I wanted was fresh water; avocame into this
creek in the evening, resolvmg to swrm on share as soon as it
was dark and discover the country; but, as soon as it was
quite dark, we heard such dreadful noises of the barking,
roaring, and howlin of wild creatures, of we knew not what
kinds, that the poorfio was ready to die with fear, and beg
of me not to go on s ore till day. " WVell', Xury," sat I,
"then I won't; but it may be we may see men by day, who
will be as bad to us as those hons."----" Then we g'i'alth in the
shoot un " savs Xury, lau hing, "make them': "

Such nglish Xury spoke y oonversmg among us- . ave}.
However, I was glad to see the boy so cheerful, and I gave him
a dram (out of our atron's case of bottles) to cheer him up.
After all, Xury's a vice was good, and I took it; we droplped
our little anchor, and lay still all night; I say still, for we 5 ept
none; for in two or three hours we saw vast great creatures
(we knew not what to call them) of many sorts, come down to
the sea-shore, and run into the water, wallowing and washing
themselves for the )leasure of cooling themselves; anfiiey
made such hideous owlings and yellings, that I never I eed
heard the like.

Xury was dreadfully fri htencd, and indeed so was I too;
but we were both' more frig xtened when we heard one of these
mighty creatures come swnnming towards our heat; we could
not see him, but we might hear him by his blowing to be a
monstrous huge and furious beast; Xury said it was a lion,
and it might be so for aught I know; but poor Xury cried to
me to wei h the anchor and row away : " No," says I, " Xury;
we can ip our cable with the buoy to it, and go of? to sea;
they cannot follow us far." I had no sooner said so, butI per-
ceived the creature (whatever it was;l within two oars' length,
which somethin surprised me; owever, I immediately
stepped to the ca in door, and taking up my gun,_fired at him :
upon which he immediately turned about, and swam towards
the shore again. .

But it is impossible to describe the horrible noises, and hid-
eous cries'and .bwlings, that were raised, as well u yon the
edge of the shore as higher within the country, upon t no noise
'0! tenor: of the un, a thing I have some reason to believe
those creatures ad never heard before: this convinced me
that there was Ito-going on shore for us inlthe night upon that'
coast, and how to venture on shore in the day was another
question too; for to have fallen into the hands of any of the
anLes, had been as bad as to have fallen into the hands of

'~ w 'figdftigers; at least we were equally apprehensive of the

law that as it would, we were obliged to go on share some-

0
where or other for water, for we had not 3. mt left in the boat:
when or where to get it, was the point: ury said, if I would
let him go on shore with one of the jars, he would find if there
was any water and bring some to me. I asked him wh he
would go; why I should not go, and he stay in the boat. he
boy answered with so much affection, that made me love him
ever after. Sa 's he, "If wild mans come, they eat me, you
go 'yfl--" ell, Xur ," said I, " we will both go, and If the
wil mans come we w' kill them; they shall eat neither of
us." So I gave Xury a piece of rusk bread to eat, and a dram
out of our atron's case of bottles, which I mentioned before;
and we hau ed the boat in as near the. shore as we thought was
proper, and so waded to shore; carrying nothing but our arms,
and two jars for water. -

I did not care to go out of sight of the boat, fearing the
coming of canoes with savages down the river; but the boy,
seeing a low place about a mile up the country, rambled to it;
and by and by I saw him come runmn towards me.- I thought
he was pursued by some savage, or frig ted with some wild beast,
and I run forward towards him to help him; but when I came
nearer to him, I saw something hangin over his shoulders,
which was a creature that he had shot, li e a hare, but differ-
ent in color, and longer legs; however, we were very glad of
it and it was very good meat; but the great jo that poor
Xury came with, was to tell me he had blind water, and
seen no wild mans. j>>~

But we found afterwards, that we need not take such pains
for water, for a little ,hi her up the creek where .we was, we
found the water fresh w en the tide was out, which flows but
a little way up; so we filled our jars, and feasted on the bare
we had killed, and prepared to go on our way, havmg seen no
footsteps of any human creature in that part of the country.

As I had been one voyage to this coast before I knew very
well that the islands ol' the Canaries, and theeape do Verd
islands also, lay not far of from the coast. But as I ladle

instruments to take an observation to know what latitude fl

magi.aosmsox muses: 3)

were in,_ and not exactly_knowinE, or at least rememberm ,
what latitude they were in, and new not where to look
them, or when to stand ofl' to sea towards them; otherwise
I might now easily have found some of these islands. But my
hope was, that if I stood along'this eoast'till Ieame to that
part where the _English traded, I should find some of their
vessels upon their usual design of trade, that would relieve and
take us In. M

By the best of my calculation, tha't place-where I 4.
must be that country, which,l ing between the empaorof
Morocoo's dominions and the egroes, lies waste, and unin-
habited,.exce t by wild beasts; the Negroes having abandoned .
it, and one arther south for fear of the Moors; and the Moon - '-
not thin 'in it worth inhabiting, by reason of its barrennessi"
and indeed th forsaking it because of the {prodigious num-
bers of tigers, lions, and leopards, and other unous. creatures
which harbor there; so that the Moors use it for their hunting
only, where they (go like an army, two or three thousand men
at a. 'time; and in eed for near a hundred miles together upon
this coast, we saw nothing but a waste, uninhabited country
by day, and'heard nothing but howlings and roaring of wild
beasts by night. .

Once or twice in the day-time I thmfiht I saw the Pico of
Teneritl'e, being the high top of the ountain Tenerifi'e in
the Canaries, and 'llad a great mind to venture out, in he s
of reaching thithetzibuta aving tried'twiee, I was for in
again by contrary'wmds the sea also going too high for my
little vessel-g so I resolved to pursue my first design, and keep
along'the shore. . - ' .

Several times I was obliged to land for fresh water, alter we
had left this place; and once in particular being early in the
morning, we came to an anchor_unda a itfle point of land
which was pretty high; and the ude beginning to flow, we lay
still to go farther in. Xury whose eyes were more about him
than it seems mine were, calls softly to me, and tells media"

lies a dreadful monster on the side of that hillock fast asleep."
I looked where he pointed, and saw a dreadful monster indeed,
for it was a terrible great lion that lay on the side of the shore,
under the shade of a piece of the hill that hung as it were a
little over him. " Xury " says I, " you shall 0 on shore and
kill him." Xury looked frightened and sai , "Me kill! he
eat me at one mout :" one mouthful he meant: however, l
said no more to the boy, but bade him lie still, and I took our
biggest un, which was almost musket-bore, and loaded it with
a good 0 large of powder, and with two slugs, and laid it down;
then I loaded another gun With two bullets - and the third (for
we had three ieces I loaded with five smaller bullets. I took
the best aim con with the first piece to have shot him in
the head, but he lay so with his leg raised a little above his
nose, that the slugs hit his leg about the knee, and broke the
bone. He started up, growling at first, but find-i 0' his len'
broke, fell down again, and then got 11 upon three s, an:
gave the most hideous~roar that ever heard. I was a little
surprised that I had not hit him on the head; however, I took
up the second piece immediately, and, though he began to
move 06', fired again, and shot him in the head, and had the
pleasure to see_him drop, and make but little noise, but lie
struggling for life. Then any took heart, and would have
me t him go on shore; " Well, go}; said I;' so the ho
jumped into the water, and taking a little gun in one han ,
swam to shore with the other hand, and coming close to;
the creature, put the muzzle of the piece to his ear, and shot
him in the head again, which despatched him quite.

This was game Indeed to us, but this was no food; and l:
was very sorry tau lose three charges of powder and shot upon
a creature that was good for notaing to us. However, Xur)?
said he would have some of him; so he comes on board, am)
asked me to give him the hatchet. " For what, Xury'! " said
l. " Me cut off his head," said he. However, Xury could not
cut at? his head, but he cut ofl'a foot, and brought itwith. him
and it was a monstrous great one;<<nu [WRWW>>~.. .. -

ROBINSON CRUSOE. a;

I bethought myself however, that perhaps the skin of him
might one way or other he of some value to us; and I resolved
to take of his skin if I could. So Xury and I went to work
with him; but Xury was much the better workman at it, for
I knew very ill how to do it. Indeed it took us both up the
whole day but at last we got oi? the hide of him and s read-
ing it on the top of our 'cabin, the sun effectually ' it in
two days' time, and it afterwards served me to lie upoi;

After this stop, we made on to the southward continually
for ten or twelve days, living very sparing on our rovismns,
which began to abate ver . much, and gotng no 0 ener into
the shore than we were ob iged to for fresh water: m design
in this was to make the river Gambia or Senegal, at is to
say, any where about the Cape de Verd where _I was in hopes
to meet with some European ship; and if I did not I knew
not what course I had to take, but to seek for the islands, or
perish there amon the Negroes. I knew that all the ships
rom Europe, whic sailed either to the coast of Guinea, or to
Brazil, or to the East Indies, made this cape, or those islands:
and in a word, I put the whole of my fortune upon this si.i
gle'pgint, either that I must meet with some' ship or must

ris . .
peWhen I had pursued this resolution about ten days longer,
as I have said, I- began to see that the land was inhabited;
and in two or three places, as we sailed by we saw people
stand upon tlwshore to look at us; we could also perceive
they were quite/black, and stark naked. I was once inclined
to have gone on shore to them; but Xury was my better coun-
sellor, and said to me, "No 0, no go." However I hauled
in nearer the shore that I mig ttalk to them, and I lbund they
run along the shore by me a good way: I observed they had
no weapons in their hands, except one, who had a lon slender
stick, which Xury said was a lance, and that they wo d throw
them a great wa with a good aim; sol kept at a distance,
but talked with em by signs _as well as I could; and partic;
ularly made gigns for sometheng to eat; they beckoned to'
me to Stop my boat, and they would. fetch me some meat.
Upon this I lowered the top of my sail, and lay by, and two
of them ran up into the countr , and in less than half an hour
came back, and brought with t rem two ieces of dry flesh and
some ,corn, such as is the produce of t eir country; but we
neither knew what the wear the other was: however, we
were willinglto accept it, but how to-come at it was our next
dispute, for. was not for venturing on shore to them, and the
were as much afraid of us: but they took a safe way for us

for they brought it to the shore, and laid it down, and went and
stood a great way 03' till we fetched it on board, and then came
close to us again.

We made signs of thanks to them, for we had nothing to
make them amends; but an o portunity ofi'ered that very in-
stant to oblige them wonderful y; for while we were lying by
the shore came two mighty creatures, one pursuing the other
(as we took it?I with great fury from the mountains towards
the sea; whet er it was the male pursuing the female, or
whether they were in sport or in rage, we could not tell, any
more than we could tel whether it was usual or strange, but I
believe it was the latter; because, in the first place, those
ravenous creatures seldom appear but in the night; and in
the second place we found the people terribl frightened, es-
pecially the women. The man that had the ance or dart did
not fly from them, but the rest did; however, as the two
creatures ran directly into the water they did not seem to
offer to fall upon any of the Negroes, but plunged themselves
into the sea, and swam about, as if they had come for their di-
version : at last, one of them began to come nearer our boat than
I at first ex ected; but I lay ready for him, for I had loaded
my gun with all possible expedition, and bade Xury load both
the others. As soon as he came fairly within my reach, _I fired,
and shot him directly in the head: immediately be sunk down
into the water, but rose instantly, and plun ed up and down, as
if he was struggling for life; and so ind he was; he imme-
diately made to the shore; but between the wound, which was
his mortal hurt, and the strangling of the water, he died just
before he reached the shore.

It is impossible to express the astonishment of these poor
creatures at the noise and fire of m gun: some of them were
even ready to die for fear, and fell own as dead with the <<any
terror; but when they saw the creature dead, and sunk in the
water, and that I made signs to them to come to the shore,
they took heart, and came to the shore, and began to search"
for the creature. I found h1m_by lus blood staining the water -
and b the help of a rope .which I slung round him, and gavi'
the egroes to haul, they dragged him on shore, and found
that it was a most curious leopard, spotted, and fine to an ad-
mirable degree; and the Negroes held up their hands with
admiration, to think what it was I had killed him with. .

The other creature, frightened with the flash of fire and
the noise of the gun, swam on shore,,and ran'u directly to
the mountains from whence they came; nor co d I at that
distance, know what it was. I found quickly the Negroes
were for eatin the flesh of this creature; so I was willing to
have them t e it as a favor from me; which, when I made
signs to them that they 'might take him, they were very
thankful for. Immediately they tell to work With him; and
though they had no_ knife, yet With a shargened piece of wood,
they took efi'lus skm as readily and mac more readily, than
we could have done with a km e. The offered me some of
the flesh, which! declined, making as i I would give it them,
but made signs for'the skin, which the _ gave meyery freel ,
and brought me a great deal more of 1r provisions, whic ,
though I did not understand, yet I accepted. I then made
signs to them for some water, and held out one of my jars to
them turning it bottom upward, to show that it was empty,
and clm I wanted u; have'it filled. They called immedia
to some of their friends, and [there came two women, and

Xury on shore with my jars, and filled them all three. The
women were as stark naked as the men.

I was now furnished with roots and corn, such as it was
and water; and leaving my friendly Ne recs, I made forwar
for about eleven davs more, without 0 ering to go near the
shore, till I saw the land run out a great length into the sea
at about the distance of four or five leagues before me; an
the sea being very calm, I kept a large ofling, to make this

Int. At length, doublin the saint, at about two-leagues

m the land, I saw plain y Ian on the other side, to sea-
ward; then I concluded, as it was most certain indeed, that
this was the Ca e de Verd, and those the islands, called, from
thence, Cape e Verd Islands. However, they were at a
great distance, and I could not well tell what 1 had best to do;
or if I should be taken with a gale of wind, I might neither
reach one nor the other. .

In this dilemma, as I was very pensive, I stepped into the
cabin, and sat me down, Xur having the helm; when, on a
sudden, the boy cried out, " aster, master, a ship with a
sail!" and the foolish boy was frightened out of is wits,
thinking it must needs be some of his master's ships sent to
pursue us, when I knew we were gotten far enough out of
their reach. I gum (I out of the cabin, and Immediately
saw, not only t e 5 ip, but what she was, viz. that it was a
Portuguese shils, and, as I thought, was bound to the coast
of Guinea, for egroes. But, when I observed the course she
steered, I was soon convinced they were bound some other
way, and did not design to come any nearer to the shore;
upon which I stretche out to sea as much as I could, re-
solvin to speak with them, if sxble.

Wit all the sail I could ma e, I found I should not be able
to come in their way, but that they would be one by before I
could make any signal to them 5 but after 1 ad crowded to
the utmost, and began to deSpair, they, it seems, saw me by

I was encouraged with this, and as I had my patron's ensign
on board, I made a Wait of it to them, for a Signal of distre ' >
and fired a un, both which they saw; for they told me the -'
saw the smo e, though they d" not hear the gun. Upon thse' ,-
signals, they very kindly brought to, and lay by for me; and deg .
in about three hours' time I came up with them. _

They asked me what I was, in Portuguese, and in Spanish,
and in French, but I understood none of them; but, at last, a"
Scotch sailor, who was on board, called to me, and I answered
him, and told him I was an Englishman; that I had made my
escape out of slavery from the Moors, at Sallee: they then
bade 01:?! come on board, and very kindly took me in, and all
my g s.

It was an inex ressible joy to me, which any one will be-
lieve, that I was t us delivered, as I esteemed it, from such a
miserable, and almost hopeless condition, as I was in _; and l
immediawa offered all I, had to the captain of the ship, as a
return for my deliverance; but he generously told me, he
would take nothing from me, but that all I had should be de-
livered safe to me when I came to the Brazils. " For," sa 5
he, " I have saved your life on no other terms than Iwould
Find to be saved myself; and it may, one time or other, be my
ot to be taken up in the same condition. Besides," continued
he, "when I carry on to the Brazils, so great a way fi'om
your own country, i I should take from you what you have,
on will be starved there, and then I only take away that
lie I have given. No, no, Seignior Inglese " (Mr. English~
man), says ; " I will carry you thither in charity, and these
things will help to buy your subsistence there, and your
passafi: home again."

As was charitable in this proposal, so he was just in the
performance, to a tittle; for lie ordered the seamen, that none
should ofl'er to touch any, thing I had: then he took every
thing into his own possession, and gave me back an exact in-38 ROBINSON Cit 0305.

rentory of them, that I might have them, even so much as my
three earthen jars.

As to my boat, it was a very good one; and that he saw'
and told me he would buy it of me for the shi '5 use; an
asked me' what I would have for it. I told him, e had been
so enerous to me in every tiling that I could not offer to
ma e any price of the boat, but led it entirely to him: upon
which, he told me he would give me a note of hand to pay me
eighty pieces of eight for it at Brazil; and when it came there,
if any one offered to give more, he would make it up. He
offered me also sixty neces of eight more for my boy Xury,
which I was loth to ta e; not that I was not willing to let the
captain have him, but I was very loth to sell the poor boy's
liberty, who had assisted me so faithfully in procuring my
own. However, when I let him know my reason,- he owned it
to be just, and offered me this medium, that he would give
the boy an obligation to set him free in ten years, if he turned
Christian: u on this, and Xury saying he was willing to go'
to him, I let t e captain have him. .

We had a very good voyage to the Brazils, and arrived in
the Bay de Todos los Santos, or All Saints' Bay, in about
twenty-two days after. And now I was once more delivered
from the most miserable of all conditions of life; and what to
do next with myself, I was now to consider. -

The generous treatment the captain gave me, I can never
enough remember: he would take nothing of me for my {pass
sage, gave me twent ducats for. the leopard's skin, an orty
for the lion's skin, w ich I had in my boat and caused every
thing I had in the ship to be unctually delivered to me; and
what I was willing to sell, he ught of me; such as the case
of bottles, two of my guns, and a iece of the lump of bees-
wax,--f'or I had made candles of t e rest: In a word, I made
about two hundred and twenty ieces of eight of .all my cargo;
and with this stock, 1 went on s ore in the Brazils. .

I had not been long here, before I was recommended to the

house of a good, honest mm, like himself, who hid an ingeino,
as they call it (that is, a plantation and a sugar-house). I
lived wrth him some time, and acquainted myself, by that
means, With the manner of planting and making of sugar; and
seeing how well the'planters lived, and how they got rich sudn
denl , I resolved, I I co a license to settle'there, I
W0 d turn planter among m; endeavoring in the mean
time, to find out some way 'to c my money,- which I had left
in London, remitted to me. 0 this purpose, getting a kind
of a letter of. naturalization, I purchased as much land that
was uncured as my money would reach, and formeda plan
for mv plantation and settlement; such a one as might be
suitable to the stock which I proposed to myself to receive
from- England. ~_

I had a neighbor, a Portuguese of Lisbon, but born of
English parents, whose name was Wells, and in much such
circumstances as I was. I call him my neighbor, because his
plantation lay next to mine, and we went on very sociably to-
gether. My stock was but low, as well as his; and we rather

lanted for food than any thing else, for about two years.

owever, we be an to increase, and our land began to come
into order; so t at the third year we planted some tobacco,
and made each of us a large piece of flound read for plant:
ing canes in the year to come : but we th wante help; and
now I found, more than before, I had done wrong in parting
with my be Xury. .

But, alas. for me to do wron , that never did right, was no
great wonder. I had no reme y, but to go on: I had ot into
an employment uite remote to my genius, and three y com
trar'y to the life dcliwhted in, and for which I forsook my
father's house, and bro e'throurrh all his good advice: nay, l
was coming into the very middl'e station, or upper derrree of
lowlife, which my father advised me to before; and which, il
I resolved to go on with, I might as well have staid at home,
and never have fatigued myself in the world, as I had done:
Ind I used ofien' to say to myself, I could have done this a>>
well in England, among my friends, as have gone five thousand
miles of? to do it among strangers and savages, in a wilderness,
and at such a distance as never to hear from any part of the
world that had the least knowledge of me. _ _ .

In this manner, I used to look upon my condition with the
utmost regret. I had nobody to converse with, but now and
then this neighbor; no work "be done, but by the labor of
my hands; and I used to say, I lived just like a man cast
away upon some desolate island, that had nobody there but
himself. But how just has it been! and how should all men
reflect, that when they compare their resent conditions with
others that are worse, Heaven may ob ige them to make the
exchange, and be convinced of their former felicit by their
experience: I say, how just has it been, that the tru y solitary
life I reflected on, in an island of mere desolation, should be
my lot, who had so often unjustly compared it with the life
which I then led, in .which, had I continued, I had, in all
probability, been exceeding pros erous-and rich.

I was, in some degree, settl in my measures for carry-
ing on the plantation, before my kind friend, the captain
of the ship that took me up at sea, went back; for the
ship remained there, in providing his lading, and preparing
for his voya , near three months; when, telling 'm what
little stock I ad left behind me in London, he ave me this
friendly and sincere advice: " Seignior Inglese,' says he for
so he always called~me), "if you Will ive me letters, an a
procuration here in form to me, with or ers to the person who
ias your money in London, to send your efl'ects to Lisbon, to
such persons as I shall direct, and m such oods as are pro r
for this country, I will bring you the pr ace of them, 0d
willing, at my return; but, smce human affairs are all subject
to changes and disasters, I would have you give orders for but.
one hundred pounds sterling, which, you say, is half your
stock, and let the hazard be run for the first, so that if it come
safe, you may order the rest the same way; and, if it mis-
carry; you may have the other half to have recourse to for
your supply." .
This was so wholesome advice, and looked so friendl , that
I could not but be_convinced it was the best course could
take; so I accordingly prepared letters to the gentlewoman
with whom _I left my money, and a procuration to the Portu-
guese captain as he dessred me. _

I wrote the English captamis wrdow a full account of all my
adventures; my slavery, escape, and how I had met with the
Portuguese captain at sea,_the humanity of his behavior and
what condition I was now in, withsll other necessary irec-
tions for my sup y: and when this honest captain came to
Lisbon, he form means, by some of the English merchants
there, to send over, not the order only, but a full account of
my story to a merchant at London, who represented it effect-
ually to her; whereupon she not only delivered the money,
but, out of her own ocket, sent the Portu uese captain a very
handsome present or his humanity and c arity to me. _

The merchant in London, vesting this hundred pounds in
English goods, such as the ca tain had wrote for, sent them
direct] to him at Lisbon, and e brought them all safe to me
at the razils; among which, without my direction (Tor I was
too younlr in my business to think of them), he had taken care
to have all sorts of tools, tron work, and utensils, necessary for
mwlantation, and which were of great use to me.

hen this cargo arrived, I thought my fortune made, for I
was surgrised at the joy of it; and my ood steward, the up
tain, ha laid out the five pounds, whic m friend had sent
him as a present for himse f, to purchase an bring me over a
servant, under bond for srx years' service, and would not ao-
cept of any consideration, except a little tobacco, which 1
would have him acce t, being of, my own produce.

Neither was this ; but m oods being all English man-
ufactures, such as cloths, stu s, aize, and things particularl
valuable and desirable in the country 1 found means to as!
them to a very great advantage; so that I might say,l had
more than four times the value of my first cargo, and was now
Infinitely beyond4my poor neighbor, I mean in the advance-
ment of my plantation; for the first thing I did, I bought
me a N o slave and a European servant also; I mean
another sides that which the captain brought me from
Lisbon. _

But as abused prosperity is oftentimes made the very means
of our adversity, so was it with me. I went on the next year
with great success in my plantation; I raised fifty great rolls
of tobacco on my own ground, more than I had disposed of for
necessaries among my neighbors; and these fifty rolls being
each of above a hundred weight, were well cured,.and laid by
against the return of the fleet from Lisbon; arid now, increas--
ing in business and in wealth, my head began to be full of
projects and undertakin s beyond my reach; such as are
Indeed, often the ruin o the best heads in business. HadI
continued in the station I was now in, I had room for all the
happy things to have yet befallen me, for which my father so
earnestlly recommended a quiet, retired life, and which he had
sosensi ly described the middle station of lifeto be full of;
but other things attended me, and I was still to be the wilful
agent of all my. own miseries; and, particularly, to increase
my fault, and double the reflections upon myself, which, in
my future sorrows, I should have leisure to make, all these
miscarriages were procured by my apparent obstinate adhering
to my foo ish inclination, of wandering about, and pursuing
that Inclination, in contradiction to the clearest views of doinr-r
myself good in a fair and pl 'n pursuit of those prospects, and
these measures of life, which nature and Providence concurred
to resent me with, and to make my duty.

3 I had once done thus in breakin away from my parents,
so I could not be content now, but must go and leave the
happy View] had of being a rich and t ' ' g man in my new
plantation, only to pursue a rash and: erate desne of
rising faster than the nature of the thing admitted; and thus
I cast myself down it into the deepest uFulf of human
misery that ever man ll into,_or t1rlieerhaps co d be consistent
vnth life, and a state of health in world.
To come, then, by just degrees, to the particulars of this
part of my story :wYou may suppose, that havmg now lived
almost four years in the Brazils, and beginning to thrive and
prosper very well upon my plantation, 1 had not only learned
the language, but had contracted an ac uaxntance and
friendship, among my lbllow--plzmters, as we! as among the
merchants at St. Salvador, which was our port; and that, in
my discourses among them,I had frequently given them an
account of my two voyages to the coast ot'Guinea, the manner
of trading with the Negroes there,_and how easy it was to pur-
chase on the coast, for trities--such as heads, toys, knives
scissors, hatchets, bits of glass, and the like-not only gold
dust, Guinea grains, elephants" teeth, &c., but Negroes, for
the service of the Brazils, in great numbers. '

They listened always very attentively to my discourses on
these heads, but especially to that part which related to. the
buying Negroes; which was a trade, at that time, not only not
far entered into, but, as far as it was, had been carried on b
the assientos, or ermission of the kings of S ain and Portug ,
and engrossed rom the public; so that ew Negroes were
bought, and those excessive dear.

It happened, being in company with some merchants and
planters of my ac uaintance, and talking of those things very

- earnestly three 0 them came to me the next mornin and
told me they had been musing very much upon what had
discoursed with them of the last night, and they came to make
a. secret roposal to me; and, after enjoining me to secrecy,
they toldp me that they had a mind to fit out a ship to go to
Guinea; that they had all plantations as well as I, and were
straitened for nothing so much as servants; that as it was a
trade that could not be carried on, because they could not
gub'hcly sellrthe Negroes when they came home, so they do-
siredto make but one voyage, to bring the Negroes on shore
privately and divide them among their own lantations; and,

of Guinea; and they offered me that 1 should have an equa
share of the Negroes, without providing any part of the stock.

This was a fair pro , it must be confessed, had it been
made to an one that ad not a settlement and plantation of
his own to ook after, which was in a fair way ofcomin to be
very considerable, and with a good stock upon it. But me,
that was thus entered and established, and had nothing to do
but go on as I had begun, for three or four years more, and to
have sent for the other hundred nnds .from England; and
who, in that time, and with that 'ttle addition, could scarce
have failed of being worth three or four thousand pounds ster-
ling, and that increasing too; tbr me to think of such a vo ,
was the most preposterous thing that ever man, in sue cir.
cumstances, could be guilty of. ,

But I, that was born to be my own destroyer, could no more
resist the offer, than I could restrain my first rambling designs,
linen my father's good counsel was lost upon me. In a word,
I told them I woul go With all_my heart, if they would under~
take to look_ after my plantation in my absence, and would
dispose of it to such as should direct, if I miscarried. This
they all eng to do, and entered into writi sor covenants
to 0 so; an_ I made a formal will, disposinge my plantation
and effects, in case of my death, making captain of the
ship,that had saved my life, as before, m universal heir; but
obliging him to dispose of my effects as _ had direcwd in my
will; (me half of the produce being to himf, and the other
to be shipped to land.

In short, I took al figssihle caution to preserve my effects,
and to keep umyes _ tation: had I used half as much pru-
dence to have It into my own interest, and have made a
iudgrnent of what I ought to have done and not to have done,

But I was hurried on, and obeyed blindly. the dictates of
my fancy, rather than my reason; and according] ' , the ship
being fitted out, and the cargo furnished, and all ngs done
as by agreement, by my partners in the wage, I went on
board in an evd hour again, the lat 'of Septem r, 1659, heir
the same day eight years that I went from my father an
mother at Hull, In order to act the rebel to their authority, and
the fool to my own interest. .

Our ship was about one hundred and twent W13,
carried six guns, and fourteen men, besides matter, he

to the northward upon our own coast with design to stretc

of our meri died of the calenture and one man and a boy
washed overboard. About the twelfth day, the weather abat-
ing a little. the master made an observation as well as he could,
and found that he was in about 11 de rees north latitude, but
that he was 22 degrees of longitude di erence, west from Cape
St. Augustino; so that he found he was got upon the coast of
Guiana, or the north part of Brazil, beyond the river Amazons,
toward that of the river Oroono ue, commonly called the
Great River; and be an to cons t with me what course he
should take, for the s i was leaky and very much disabled,
and he was goin directl;r back to the coast of Brazil.

I was posntive y against that; and looking over the charts
of the sea-coast of America with him, we concluded there was
no inhabited countr for us to have recourse to, till we came
within the circle 0 the Caribbee islands, and therefore re-
solved to stand awa for Barbadoes; which, b keeping of to
sea, to avoid the in raft of the bay or ulf of exico, We might
easnly perform, as we ho d, In about fteen days' sail; where-
as we could not possib y make our voyage to the coast of
Africa without some assistance both to our ship and ourselves.

With this design we changed our course, and steered away
N .W. by W., in order to reach some of our English islands,
where I hoped for relief; but our voy was otherwise de-
termined; or being in the latitude of 12 e ees 18 minutes a
second storm came upon us, which carri us away with the
same im tuosity westward, and drove us so out of the ver
way of 1 human commerce, that had all our lives been saved}:
as to the sea, we were rather in danger of being devoured by
savages than ever returnin to our own country. '

In this distress, the win still blowin very hard, one of our
men early in the morning cried out, " d . " and we had no
sooner run out of the cabin to look out in hopes ol seeing
whereabouts in-the world we were, but the ship struck upon
a sand, and in a moment, her motion being sostopped, the
sea broke over her in such a manner, that we expected we
should all have perished immediately; and we were immedi-

ately driven into our close quarters, to shelter us from the
very foam and spray of the sea. . ,

It is not easy or any one, who has not been in the like con-
dition, to describe or conceive the consternation of men in
such circumstances; we knew nothing where we were or
upon what land it was we were driven, whether an islan or
the main, whether inhabited or not inhabited; and as the
rage of the wind was still great, though rather less than at
first, we could not so much as hope to have the ship held many
minutes, without breaking' in pieces, unless the wind, by a
kind of miracle, should immediatel turn about. In a word, we
sat lookinig upon one another, an expecting death every mo-
ment, an every man acting accordingly,_ as preparing for
another world; for there was little or nothing more for us to
do in this: that which was our present comfort, and_all the
comfort we had, was, that, contrary.to our e'igiectation the
ship did not break yet, and that the master sai the Wind be-
gan to abate. ' _

Now, thou h we thought that the wind did a little abate,
yet the ship aving thus struck upon the sand, and stickin
too fast for us to expect her getting off, we were in a dreadfu
condition indeed, and had nothin to do but to think of
saving our lives as well as we coul . We had a boat at our
stern just before the storm, but she was first staved by dashing
against the ship's rudder, and, in the next place, she broke
away, and either sunk, or was driven off to sea; .so there was
no hope from her: we had another boat on board, but how to
get her ofi' into the sea was a doubtful thing; however, there
was no room to debate, for we fancied ,the ship would break
in pieces every minute, and some told us she was actually
bro en already. '

In this distress, the mate of our vase] laid hold of the boat,

And now our case was very dismal Indeed; for we all saw

and that we should be inevitably drowned. As to making sail,

heavy hearts, like men going to execution; for we I knew
that when the boat came nearer t6 the shore, she would be
dashed in a thousand pieces by the breach of the sea. How-
ever, we committed our souls to God in the most earnest man-
ner ; and the wind driving us towards the shore, we hastened
our destruction with our own hands, pulling as well-as we
could towards land. .

What the shore was--whether rock or sand, whether steep
or shoal--we knew not; the only hope that could rationally
give us the least shadow of expectation, was, if we might hap-
Ec-n into some bay or gulf, or the mouth of some river, where

y great chance we might have run our boat in, or got under
the lee of the land, and perhaps made smooth water. But
there was nothing of this ap ared; and as we made nearer
alnd nearer the shore, the and looked more frightful than
he sea.

After we had rowed, or rather driven, about a lea e and a
half, as we reckoned it, a Night wave, mountain-h e, came
rolling astern of us, and plain ade us expect the coup de

race. In a word, it took us wtt such a fury, that it overset the

at at once; and separating us, as well from the boat as from
one another, gave us not time hardly to say, " O God! " for
we were all swallowed up in a moment.

Nothing can describe the confusion of thought which I felt,
when I sunk into the water; for though I swam very well, yet
I could not deliver myself from the waves so as to draw my
breath, till that wave avin driven me, or rather carried me,
a vast way on towards the ore, and havmg spent itself, wentROBINSON (mason; '9

back, and left me upon the land almost dry, but half dead with
the water I took in. I had so much presence of mind, as well
as breath lefi, that, seeing in 'self nearer the main land than
Iexpected, I got upon my set, and endeavored to make on
towards the land as ast as could, before another wave should
return and take me ii again; but I soon found it was impos-
sible to avoid it; for saw the sea come alter me as high as a
great hill, and as furiOus as an enemy, which I had no means or
strength to contend with: my business was to hold m breath,
and raise myself upon the water, if I could; and so, y swim-
ming, to preserve my breathing, and pilot myself towards the
shore, if possible- my greatest concern now bemg, that the
wave, as it would carry me a great way towards. the shore
when it came on, might not carry me back again With it when
it ave back towards the sea. .
he wave that came upon me again buried me at once

twenty or thirty feet deep in its own body; and 'I could feel
myself carried with a mighty force and swiftness towards the
shore a very great way; but I held my breath, and amend
myself to swim still forward with all my might. I was ready
to burst with holding my breath, when, as I felt myself an
up, so, to my immediate relief, I found my head and ban
shoot out above the surface of the water; and though it was
not two seconds of time that I could keep myself so, yet it re-
lieved me greatly, gave me breath, and new cour . I was
covered again with water a good while, but not so ong but I
held it out' and finding the water had spent itself and began
to return,I struck forward against the return of the waves,
and felt ground again with my feet. I stood still a few
moments, to recover breath, and till the water went from me
and then took to my heels, and ran with what stren h I had
farther towards the shore. But neither would. this eliver me
from the fury of the sea, which came pouring in after me
again; and twice more I washfted up by the waves and ear-
ned forwards as before, the shore bemg very flat.

the sea, having hurried me along, as before, landed me, or rather
dashed me, against a piece of a rock and that With such force,
that it left me senseless, and indeed helpless as tomy own de<<
liverance; for the blow takin my side and breast, beat the
breath, as it were, nite out o my body; and had it returned *

I recovered a lit e before the return of the waves,~and seein I
should again be coveredsvith the water,I resolved to hold ant
b'fi a piece-of the rock, and so to hold my breath, if possible,
1' the wave went back. Now, as the waves were not so high
as the first, being nearer land, I, held in hold till the wave
abated, and then letched another run whic brought me so near
the shore, that the next wave, though it went over me, yet did
not so swallow me up as to carry me away; and the next run I
took, I got to the mainland; where, to my great comfort I
clambered up the chili; of the shore, and sat me down upon t e
grass, free from danger, and nite out of the reach of the water.
I was now landed, and s e on shore, and began to look up
and thank God, that my life was saved, in a case wherein there
were, seine minutes before, scarce any.room to hope. I be-
lieve it is lmpOSSIble to express, to the life, what the ecstasies
and transports of the soul are when it is so saved, as I may
say, out of thwave; and I 'd not wonder now at the cus- 1;"
tom, viz. that when a malefactor, who has the' halter about'his
neck, is tied up, and just goin to be turned off and has a re-
prieve brought to him; I say do not wonder that the-gab ' '
asurgeon With it, to let him blood that very moment yntgfi
him of itfithat the surprise ma not drive the animal spirits

from the eart, and overwhelm 'm;

For sudden joys, like griefs, confound at first. ,

I walked about on the shore, lilting up my hands, and my
whole being, as I ma say, wrapt up in the contemplation of
my deliverance; in ing a thousand gestures and motions,

which I cannot describe; reflectin upon my comrades that
. were drowned, and that there sh d not be one soul'saved
but myself; for, as for them, I never saw them afterwards, or
any si n of them, except three of their hats, one cap, and two
shoes t at were not fellows.

I cast my eyes to the stranded vessel--when the breach and
froth of the sea being so big I could hardly see-it, it lay so far
off--and considered, Lord. how was it possible I could get
on shore? .

Alter I had solaced my mind with the comfortable part of
my condition, I be an to look round me to see what kind of a

lace I was in, an what was next to be done; and I soon
ound my comforts abate, and that, in a word,l had a dreadful
deliverance; for I was wet, bad no clothes to shift me, nor any
thing either to eat or drink, to comfort me; neither did I see
any prospect before me, but that of rishing with hunger, or
bemg devoured by wild boasts: an that which was particu-
larly afflicting to me, was, that I had no weapon, either to
hunt and kill any creature for my sustenance, or to defend
myself against any other creature, that might desire to kill me
for theirs. In a word, I had nothing aflit me but a knife, a
tobacco-pipe, and a little tobacco in a x. This was all my
provision; and this threw me into such terrible agonies of
mind, that, for a while, I ran about like a madman. Ni ht
coming ugon me, I began with a heavy heart, to consi er
what woal be my lot if there were any ravenous beasts in that
country, seeing at night they always come abroad for their

rey.
p All the remedy that offered to my thoughts, at that time,
was, to get up intoa thick, bushy tree, like a fir, but thorny--
which grew near me, and where I resolved to sit all night--
and consider the next day what death I should die, for as yet
I saw no pros ect of life. I walked about a furlcn from the
shore, to see i I could find any fresh water to drin_ , which I
did to my great joy; and having drank, and put a little tobac-
co into my mouth to revent hunger, I went to the tree, and
getti in into it, en eavored to place myself so as that, if I
shoulffall asleep, I might not fall; and haying cut me a short
stick, like a truncheon for rriy defence I took 11 ~myvlodgmg" ;
and having been excessively fatigued, I fell fast asl'eepfand slept
as comfortably as I believe, few could have done' in my con-
dition' and ound myself the most refreshed with it that 1
think lever was on such an occasion.

When I waked, it was broad day, the weather clear, and the
storm' abated, so that the sea did not rage and swell as before -
but that which surprised me most was, that the shi was lifted
off in the night from the sand where she lay, by e swellin
of the tide, and was driven u alm" far as the rock which
at first mentioned, where I had W's!) bruised by the wave
dashing me against it. This beirfg within about a mile from
the shore where I was, and the shlp seeming tostand upright
still, I wished myself on board, that at least might save some
necessary things for my use. -

When I came down from my a artment in the tree, I looked
about me again, and the first mg I found was the boat,
which lay, as the wind and the sea had tossed her it , upon the
land, about two miles on my right hand. I walk as far as I

could upon the shore to have got to her; but found a neck or? 7i";

inlet, of water between me and the boat, which was about half ?
mile broad ;. so I came back for the present, being more inten
upon getting at the ship, where I hoped to find something for
my present subsistence.

A httle alter noon, I found the sea very calm, and the tide
ebbed so'far out that I could come within a quarter of a mile
of the ship; and here I found a fresh renewmw of my grief;
for I saw evidently, that if we had kept on , we had been
all safe; that Is to say, we had all got safe on shore, and I had
not been so miserable as to be left entirely destitute of all com-
fort and com any, as I now was. This forced tears from my
eyes. ain; ut as there was little relief in that, I resolved, if
possr e, toget to the ship; sol nlled ofi'my clotheg forthe
weather was hot to extremity an took the water; but when
I came to the ship, mydifieultywas still greatertokndwhow

fl
water, there was nothing within my reach to lay hold of. I
swam round her twice and the second time I spied a small
piece of a rope, which I wondered I did not see at first, hang
down by the fore-chains so low, as that with great difficulty I
got hold of it, and by the help of that rope cot into the fore-
castle of the sin . HereI ound that the ship, was bulged,
and had a great eal of water in her hold; but that she lay so
on the side of a bank of hard sand, or rather earth, that her
stern lay lifted up upon the bank, and her head low, almost to
the water. By this means all her quarter was free, and all
that was in that part was dry; for you may be sure my first
work was to search-and to see what was spoiled and what was
free: and, first, I found that all the ship's provisions were dry
and untouched by the water; and bein very well disposed to
eat, I went to the bread-room, and fill my kets with his-
cuit, and ate it as I went about other things, or I had no time
to lose. I also found some. rum in the reat cabin, of which I
took a large dram,- and which I had in eed need enough of to
spirit me lbr what was before me. Now I wanted nothing but
a boat,_to furnish myself with many things which I foresaw
would be very necessary to me. '

It was in vain to sit still and wish for what was notto be
had, and this extremity roused my application: we had sev-
eral spare yards, and two or three large spars of wood, and a
spare top-mast or two in the ship: resolved to fall to work
with these, and flung as many overboard as I could manage for
their weight, tang every one with a rope, that they mtghtpot
drive away. hen this was done, I went down the 3h! '3
side, and pulling them to me, I tied four of them fast toge r
at both ends, as well as I could in the form of a rafi, and lay-
ing two or three short pieces oil plank upon them, crosswa s,
I found I could walk upon it very well, but that it was nota le
to hearrany at weight, the pieces being too light: so] went
to work, an with the car nter's saw I cut a spare top-mast
into three lengths, and a ded them to m rah, with a great
deal of labor and pains. But the hope 0 furnishing myself
with necessaries encouraged me to go beyond whatl should
have been able to have done upon another occasion.

My raft was now strong enough to hear any reasonable
weight. My next care was! what to load it With, and how to
preserve what I laid upon it'lrom the surf of the sea; but I
was not long considering this. I first laid all the rlauks or
boards upon it thatI could get, and having consi ered well
what I most wanted, I got three of the seamen's chests, which
I had broken open and em itied, and lowered them down upon
my raft; these I filled witi provisions, viz. hread, rice, three
Dutch cheeses, live pieces of dried goats' llesh (which we
lived much upon), and a little remainder of European corn,
which had been laid by for some lbwls which we had brought
to sea with us; but the fowls were killed. There had been
some barley and wheat together; hut, to my great disappoint-
ment, I (hand afterwards that the rats had eaten or spelled it
all. As for liquors, I found several cases of bottles belox) ring
to our skipper, in which were some cordial waters; an , in,
all, about live or six gallons of rack. These I stowed by
themselves, there being no need to put them into the chests,
nor any room for them. While I was doing this I found the
tide began to llow, thourrh very calm; and I had the mortifi-
cation to see my coat, shirt, and waistcoat, which I had left
on shore, upon. the sand, swim away; as for my breaches,
which were only linen, and open-knead, I swam on board in
them, and m stockin 3. However, this put me upon rum-
agin for clot es, of w ich I found enough, but took no more
than wanted for present use, for I had other thin s which my
eye was more u on; as, first, tools to work wit on shore;
and it wag alter l'onvr searching that I found the carpenter's
chest, which was indeed a very useful prize to me, and much
more yaluable than a ship-lading of 7old would have been at
that time. _ I got it down to my ra , even whole asit was,
fmthout'losmg time to look into it, for I knew in general what
'1 contained.

My next care was for some ammunition and arms. There56 ituumsux causes.

were two very good fowling-pieces in the great cabin, and two
pistols; these secured first, with some powder-horns, and a
small bag of shot, and two old rusty swords. I knew there
were three barrels of powder in the ship, but knew not where
our gunner had stowed them ; but With much search I found
them, two of them dry and good; the third had taken water.
Those two I got to my raft, with the arms. And now I thought
myself pretty well freighted, and bewan to think how I should
get to shore with them, having neither sail, oar, nor rudder;
and-the least cap-full of wind would have orerset all my nav-
tion.

'3} had three encouragements: .lst, A smooth, calm sea:
2d] , The tide rising, and setting in to the shore: 3dly, What
[it e wind there was, blew me towards the land. And thus,
having found two or three bmkeu oars belong' tothe boat,
and besides the tools which were in the chest, found two
saws, an axe, and a hammer; and with this cargo I ut to
sea. For a mile, or thereabouts, my raft went very wel ,.only
that I found it drive a little distant from the lace where I had
landed before; by which I perceived that t ere was some in-
drafi of the water, and consequently I hoped to find some
creek or river there, which I might make use of as a port to
get to land with my cargo. '

As I imagined, so it was: there appeared before me a little
opening of the land and 1 found a strong current of the tide
set into it; so I guided my raft, as well as 1 could, to get into
the middle of the stream. But here I had like to hare suffered
a second shipwreck, which, if I had, I think verily would have
broken my heart ; for knowing nothing of the coast, my raft ran
aground at one end of it upon a shoal, and not being aground at
the other end, it wanted but a little that all'my cargo had slipped
OE towards that end that was afloat, and so fallen into the water.
I did my utmost, by setting my back against the chests, to keep
them in their places, but could not thrust ofl' the raft with all:
my strength; neither durst I stir from the posture l was in,
but, holding up the chests with all my might, I stood in that
manner near half an hour, in which time the risin of the
water brought me a little more upon a level; and alit e after,
the water still using, my .rafi floated n, and I thrust her
off with the oar I had, into the charm , and then driving up
higher, I at length. found myself in the mouth of a little river,
With land on sides, and a stroiig current or tide runningup.
I looked on both sides for a proper lace to get to shore, or 1
was not willing to be driven too hig up the river; bopin , in
time, to see some ship at sea, and therefore resolved to ace
myself as near the coast as 1 could. '

At length I spied a little cove on the ri ht shore of the creek
to which, with great pain and difficulty, guided my raft, and
at last got so near, as that, reaching ground with my par, 1
could thrust her directly in; but here 1 ad like to have dipped
all my car into the sea again; for that shore lying pretty
steep, that s to'say, sloping there was no place to land,_but
where one end'of my float, itz it ran on shore, would lie so high,
and the other sink lower, as before, that it would endanger
my cars? again. All that 1 could do was, to wait till the tide
was at e highest, kee ing the raft with my oar like an anchor
to hold the side of it ast to the shore, near a flat piece of
ground, which I expected the water would flow over; and so
it did. As soon asl found water enough--for ir y raft drew
about a foot of water,--l thrust her upon that flat piece of
ground; and there fastened or moored her, by stcking my two

roken oars into the ground; one on one side, near one end,
and one on the other side, near the other end: and thus I lay
till the water ebbed away, and left my rail and all my cargo
safe on shore. , . ' '

My next work was to view the country, and seek a proper
place for my habitation, and where to stow ni' goods to secure
them from whatever might happen. Where was,l' yet knew
not; whether on_ the continent, or on an islanddeg whether")-
habited, or not tnhabited; whether in dang-rut mm,
or not. Therewasahill,uotabove amilefromine,wlmhrose
up very steep and high, and which seemed to overtop some
other hills, which lay as in a ridge from it, northward. I took
out one of the fowling-pieces, and one of the pistols, and a
horn of powder; and thus armed, I travelled for discovery up
to the top of that hill; where after I had, with great labor and
difficulty, got up to the top, I saw my fate, to my great afflic--
tion, viz. t at I was in an island, environed every way with
the sea, no land to be seen, exce t some rockstwhich la a
great way off, and two small islan 3, less than this, which ay
about three leagues to the west.

I found also that the island 1 was in was barren, and, as 1
saw good reason to believe, uninhabited, except by wild beasts,
of whom, however, I saw none; yet I saw abundance of fowls
but knew not their kinds; neither, when! killed them, could
I tell what was fit for food, and what not. At my coming
back, I shot at a great bird, which I saw sitting upon a tree,
on the side of a great wood. I believe it was the first un that
had been fired there since the creation of the world: had no
sooner fired, but from all the parts of the wood there arow an
innumerable number of fowls, of many sorts, making a con-
fused screaming, and crying, every one according to is usual
note; but not one of them of aniekind that I knew. As for
the creature I killed, I took it to a kind of a hawk, its color
and beak resembling it, but had no talons or claws more than
common. Its flesh was carrion, and fit for nothing.

' Contented with this discovery, I came back to my raft, and
i fell to work to brin my cargo _on shore, which took me up the
rest of that day: w at to do With myself at m ht I knew not,
. nor indeed where to rest; for I was afraid to re down on the
round, not knowing but some wild beast miagdit'devour me;
t ough, as I afterwards found, there was re y no need for
those fears. .
However, as well as I could, I barricadoed myself round
with the chests and boards that I had brought on shore, and

made a kind of a but for that night's lodging. As for food, l'3

yet saw not which way to supply myself, except that I had
teen two or three creatures, like hares, run out of the wood
where I shot the fowl.

'I now began to consider, that I mirrht yet ret a great many
th'i s out of the ship, which would Ire usel'u to me, and par--
tie arly some of the riggirvr and sails, and such other things
as might come to land; and I resolved to make another voyage
on- board the vessel, if possible. And as I lmew that the first
storm that blew must necessarily break her all in pieces, I re-
solved to set all other things :1 art, till I got every thin out
of=the ship that I could get. Il'hen I called'a council, t lat is
to sa , in my thoughts, whether I should take back the raft;
butt 18 appeared im racticable; so I resolved to go as before
When the tide was dldwn; and I did so, only that I strippe
before I went from m ' hut; having nothin on but a chec ed
shirt, a pair of linen rawers, and a pair 0 pumps on my feet. _ -

Igot on board the ship as before, and prepared a second
rah; and having had experience of the first, I neither made
this so unwieldy; nor loaded it so hard, but yet I brought
away several things very useful to me: as, first, in the car-
penterk stores, I found two or three bags of nails and spikes,
a great-screw-Jack adozen or two of hatchets; and, above all,
'that-mostpus'eful thing called a grindstone. All these I so-
cnmdrtogether, With several things belonging to the gunner;
particularly two or three iron crows, and two barrels of mus-

" bullets, seven muskets, and another fowling- iece with
me small quantity of owder more; a. largebag Kill 0,: small
shot, and a .at roll 0 sheet--lead; but this last was so heavy,
[Could not orst it up to get it over the ship's side.

- 'Besides these things, I took all the men's clothes that I could
hath" a spare fore-top sail, a hammock, and somebedding '
and-with this I loaded my second raft, and brought them all

Jib-Ulrshore,' to my very great comfort.

.-~-,

W; that at least or provisions mig t be devoured on
. ' but when I came ask, I found no sign of any visitor;
only there sat a creature like a. wild cat, upon one of the
chests, which, when I came towards it, ran away a little dis-
tance, and then stood still. She sat very composed and un-
concerned, and looked full in my face, as if she had a mind to
be ac uainted with 'me. I resented my un to her, but as
she di not understand it, 5 1e was perfec y unconcern at
it, nor did she ofl'er to stir away; it on which I tossed her a
bit of biscuit, though, by the way, was not very free of it,
for my store was not great: however,I spared her a bit, I say,
and she went to it, smelled of it, and ate it, and looked (as
pleased) for more; but I thanked her, and could spare no
more: so she marched ofl'.

Havin got my second cargo on shore--though I was fain
to open t e barrels of powder and brin them by parcels for
the were too heavy, being large cas s--I wcnt toworlt to
m e me a little tent, with the sail, and some es, which I
cut for that purpose; and into the tent l broug t every thigg
that I knew would spoil either with rain or sun; and I pil
all the empty chests and casks up in a circle round the tent,
to fortify it from any sudden attempt either from man or beast.

When I had done this, I blocked up the door of the tent with
some boards within, and an em t_v chest set up on end with-
out; and spreading one of the s upon the und, laying
my two pistols just at my head, and my gun at _ength by. me,
I went to bed for the first time, and slept very tamed all mfiht
for I was very weary and heavy; for the rug t be ore I ad
slept little and had labored very hard all day, as well to fetch
all those things from the ship, as to t them on shore.

I had the biggest magazine of al kinds now that ever was
laid u , I believe, for one man; but I was not satisfied stilldeg
for while the ship sat upright in that are, I thought
on ht to get every thing out of her that could; so every day,
at ow water, I went on board, and brought away sometlung
or other ; but particularly, the third time I went, I brought
away as much of the riggin as I could, as also all the small
ropes and rope-twine I coul get, With a piece of spare carpnonixs: it ('ni'sot-t. m

vans, which was to mend the sails upon occasion, and the bar.
rel'of wet gunpowder. .In a wort , I brought away all the
sails first and last; only that l was thin to cut them' in pieces,
and bring as much at a time as I could; for they were no
more useful to be sails, but as mere canvass only.

But that which comforted me still more, was, that, last of
all, after I had made live or six such voyages as these, and
thou ht I had nothing more to expect from the ship that was
wort m meddling with; I say, after all this, I found a great
h shot: of bread, and three lar've runlets of rumor spirits,
an a box of sugar, and a harmful line llourathis was sur-
prising to me, because I had given over expecting any more
provrstons, except what was SEIHlHI by the water. I soon
emptied the hogshead of that read, and wrapped it up, iar<
cel by parcel, in )icces ol' the sails, which 1 cut out; an' , in
a word, I got all t iis safe on shore also.

The next day I made another voyage; and now, havin

hindered the shi ) of what was portable and lit to hand out,

gun with the ca les, and cutting the great cable into pieces,
such as I could move, I got two cables and a hawser on shore,
with all the iron-work I could get; and having cut down the
spritsail-yard, and the rnizzcmyard, and every thing I could,
to make a large raft, I loaded it with all those heavy goods, and
came away; but my good luck began now to leave me; for
,, this rat} was so unwieldy, and so overladen, that after I was
_ entered the little cove, where I had landed the rest of my
goods, not being able to guide it so handily as I did the other,
it overset, and threw me and all my cargo into the water: as for
myself, it was no great harm, for l was near the shore ; but as to
my cargo, it was a great part ol'it lost, especially the iron, which
I expected would have been of great use to me: however,
when the tide was out, I ot most of the pieces of cable ashore,
"Id some of the iron, though with infinite labor; for I was
fun to dip for it into the water, a work which fatigued me

very much. Alter this I went every day on board, an brought
away what I could get.
I had been now thirteen days ashore, and had been ele'sien
times on board the ship; in which time I had brought away
all that one pair of hands could well be so posed capable to
bring; thou 'h I believe verily, had the c in weather held, I
shou d have rought away the whole ship, giece by iece; but
greparing the twelfth time to go on boar , I foun the wihd

egan to rise; however, at low water, I went on board' and
though I thought I had rummaged the cabin so effectually as
that nothing could be found, yet I discovered a locker with
drawers in It, in one 'of which I found two or three razors, and
one pair of lar re scissors, with some ten or a dozen of good
knives and for s; in another I found about thirt '-six unds
value in money, some Euro can coin, some raz' , some
pieces of eight, some gold, an some silver.

I smiled to myself at the sight of this money: " 0 drug!"
said I aloud, " what art thou good for! Thou art not worth
to me, no, not the taking off the ground: one of those knives
is worth all this heap: l have no manner of use for thee; e'en
remain where thou art, and go to the bottom, as a creature
whose life is not worth saving." However, upon second
thoughts, I took it away; and wrapping all this in a piece of
canvass, I began to think of makinw another raft; but while I
was preparing this, I found the shy overcast, and the wind
began to rise, and in a quarter of an hour it blew a fresh gale
from the shore. It presently occurred to me, that it was in ,
vain to pretend 'to make a raft with the wind off shore; and '1
that it was my business to be gone belbre the tide of flood be- .,
gan, or otherwise I might not be able to reach the shore at all.
According] I let myself down into the water, and swam across
the channe which lay between the ship and the sands, and
even that with difficulty enough partly with the wei ht of the
thin I had about me, and partly the roughness of e water;
for t e wind rose very hastily, and before it was quite high
water it blew a storm. .

But I was got home to my little tent, where I lay, With a!
my wealth about me very secure. It blew very hard all thatnight, and in the morning, when I looked out behold nomore
ship was to be seen! I was a little surprised, but recovered
myself with this satisfactory reflection, viz' that I had last no
time, nor abated no diligence, to get every thing out of her
that could be useful to me, and at, indeed, there was lit-
tle lefi in her that I was able to bring away, if I had had
more time.

I now gave over any more thoughts of the ship, or of any
thing out of her, except what might drive on shore, from her
wreek~ as, indeed, divers pieces of her afterwards dld; but
those things were of small use to me. .

My thoughts were now wholly employed about securin
myself against either sava s, if an should appear,or w1l
beasts, if an were in the is and; an I had man thoughts of
the method ow to do this, and what kind of dwe ling to make,
whether I should make me a cave in the earth, or a tent upon
the earth: and, in short, I resolved upon both; the manner and
description of which it may not be improper to give an ac-
count of.

I soon found the place I was in was not for my settlement,
particularly because it was u n a low, moorish ground, near
the sea, and I believed it we d not be wholesome; and more
particularly because there was no fresh water near it; so I
resolvsd to find a more healthy and more convenient spot of

man . '

g I consulted several things in m situation, which I found
would be.proper for me: lst, He th and fresh water, I just'
now mentioned: 2dly, Shelter from the heat of the sun: 3dly,
Secnnt from ravenous creatures, whether men or beasts: ; s
4th] ,1 view to the sea, that if God sent any ship in sight, I
mtg tnotlose any advanta e for my deliverance, of \vhichI
was not willing to banish my ex ectation yet.

In search for aplace pro r for t 's, I found a little lain on
the aidgof a rising hill, w ose front towards this lit e hull
was steep as a house side, so that nothing could come own

upon me ti'orn the top. 0n the side of this rock, there was a
hollow place, worn a. little way in, like the entrance or door
of :11' cave - but there was not really any cave, or way into the
roe ', at .

0n the flat of the green 'ust before this hollow place, I
rcmlved to itch my tent. his plain was not above a hun-
dred yards road, and about twice as lon , and lay like a green
before my door; and, at the end of it, escended irregularly
every way down into the low round by the sea-side. It was

.on the N .N .W. side of the h' ; so that it was sheltered from

the heat every day,-till it came to a W. and by S. sun, or there-
abouts, which, in thou countries, is near the setting.

Before I set up my tent, I drew a half-circle before the hol-
low place, which took in about ten yards in its semi-diameter
from the rock, and twenty yards in its diameter, from its be-
ginnin and endin .

In t is half-circ e I pitched two rows of strong stakes,
driving them into the ground till they stood very'firm like
piles, the biggest end being out of the ound about five feet
and a half, and sharpened on the to . he two rows did not
stand above six inches from one anot er. .

Then I took the pieces of cable which I cut in the shi , and
laid them in rows, one upon another, within the circ e, be-
tween these two rows of stakes, up to the top, placing other
stakes in the inside, leaning against them, about two feet and
a half high, like a spur to a post; and this fence was so strong,
that neither man nor beast could et into it, or over it. The
cost me a great deal of time an labor, especially to cut the
piles in the woods, bring them to the place, and drivqthem
into the earth. fig-

The entrance into this place I made to be not by a duet, but
by a short ladder to go over the to ; which ladder, whenl
was in, I lifted over after me; and so was completel' fianced
in and fortified, as I thought, from all the world, an bonsa-

quently slept secure in the night, which otherwise I c'oirld not --
hfie'drme'y though, as it appeared afterwards, there was no.
need of all this caution from the enemies that I apprehended
danger from. '

'Into this fence, or fortress, with infinite labor, I carried all
my richeshnll my provisions, ammunition, and stores,of which
you have the account above; and I made a large tent, which,
to preserve me l'romtthe rains, that in one part of the year are
ver ' violent thereg'; "$SSIdSSxdouble, viz. one smallereonfit within,
an one larger tent Edwin-and covered the uppemnost with
a large tarpaulin, whiohI had saved among the saili'

And now I lay no more for a while in the bed which I had
brought on shore but in a hammock, which was indeed a very
good one, and belonged to the mate of the ship. '

Into this tent I brought all m provisions, and every thing
that would 8 il by the wet; on havin" thus incloscd all my
goods, I ma e up the entrance, which till now I had left open,
and so passed and repassed as I said, by a short ladder.

When I had done this, I began to work my way into the
rock, and bringing all the earth and stones that I dug down,
out, through my tent, I laid them up within my fence in the
nature of a terrace, so that it raised the ground within about
a foot and a half; and thus I made me a cave, just behind my
tent, which served me like a cellar to m ' house. It cost me
much labor and many days, before al those things were
brought to perfection; and therefore I must go back to some
other things which took up some of m tho hts. At the
same time it happened, alter I had lai my so eme for the
setting up my tent and making the cave, that a storm of rain
falling from a thic t, dark cloud, a sudden flash of lightning
happened, and after that, a great clap of thunder, as is nat-
ural y the effect of it. I was not so much sur vised with the
lightning, as I was with a thou ht, which darto into my mind
asswitt as the lightning itself 2 my powder! M'y very heart
sunk within me when I thought, that at one hast, all my
powder might he destroyed; on which, not my defence only,

at the prondmg me food, as I thought, entirely depended.
l was nothing near so anxious about my own danger, though,
had the powder took lire, I had never known who had hurt me.
Such nnprt'ssion did this make upon me, that after the storm
was over, I laid aside all my Works, my building and firmly-
ing, and applied myself to make bags and boxes, to separate
the powder, and to keep it a little and a little in a parcel, m
hope that whatever might come, it might not all take fire at
once; and to keep it so apart, that it should not be possible
to make one part lire another. 1 finished this Work in about a
fortnight; and I think my powder, which in all was about
240"). weight, was divided in not less than a hundred parcels.
As to the barrel that had been wet, I did not apprehend any
danger from that; so I placed it in my new cave, which,in my
fancy, I called my kitchen, and the rest I hid up and down in
holes among the rocks, so that no wet might come to it,
marking very carefully where I laid it.
V In the interval of time while this was doin . I went out at
least once every day with my gun, as well to ivert myself, as
to see if I could kill any thing lit for food; and, as near as I
could, to acquaint myself With what the island produced.
The first time I went out,I Jresently discovered that there
were goats upon the island, which was a great satisfaction to
me; but then it was attended with this misfortune to me, viz.
that they were so shy, so subtle, and so swift of foot, that
it was the most dillicult thing in the world to come at
them; but 1 was not discouraged at this, not doubtin but I
might now and then shoot one, as it soon happened ; or after
I had found their haunts a little, I laid wait in this manner for
them 2 1 observed, if they saw me in the valleys, though they
were upon the rocks, they would run away as in a terrible
fright; but il they were feeding in the valleys, and l was upon
the rocks, they took no notice of me; from whence l conclu--
(led, that, by the position of their optics, their sight was 60 di-
rected downward, that they did not readilv see objects that
were above them: so, alterwards.l took this method--4 al-
ways climbed the rocks first, to get above them, and then had
frequently a fair mark. The first shot I made . these
creatures, I killed a she-goat, which had a little kid y her,
which she gave suck to, which grieved me heartily; but when
the old one fell, the kid stood stock still b ' her,'til I came and
took her up; and not only so, but when carried the old one
with me, upon my shoulders the kid followed me quite to my
inclosure; upon which I laid down the dam, and took the kid
in my arms, and carried it over my pale, in to have
bred it up tame; but' it would not eat; so] was ced to kill
it, and eat it myself. These two supplied me with flesh a
reat while, for I. ate sparingly, and preserved 'm provisions
m bread especial] ') as much as possibly I cou .
aving nowfixe my habitation, I found it absolutely neo
cessar to provrde a place to make a fire in, and fuel to burn;
and w at I did for that, as also how I enla ed my cave, and
what conveniences I made, I shalkgive a ull account of in
its pro r lace; but I must first give some little account of
mysel , an of my thoughts about living, which, it may well

be supposed, were not a few.

I h a dismal pros ct of my condition; for as I was not
cast away upon that ' and without bein driven, as is said, by
a Violent storm, quite out of the course 0 our intended voy ,
and a great way, viz. some hundreds of leagues, out of e
ordinary course of the trade of mankind, I had great reason
to constder it as a determination of Heaven, that in this deso-
late place, and in this desolate manner, I should end my life.
The tears would run plentifully down my face, when I made
these reflections; and sometimes I would expostulate with my-
self why Providence should thus completely ruin its creatures,
and render them so absblutel miserable; so abandoned with-
out help, so entirely depres , that it could hardly be rational
to be thankful for such a life.

But something always returned swift upon me to check these
thoughts, aml to reprove me; and articularly, one day,
walkmg with my gun in my hand, by sea-side, I was very
pensive upon the subject of my present condition, when ren-

t- .639"
- =2:
son, as it were, expostulated with me the other way, thus:
" Well, you are in a desolate condition, it is true; but, pray
remember, where are the rest of you? Did not you Come
eleven of you into the boat? Where are the. ten ! Why were
not they saved, and you lost? Why were you singled out '9
Is it better to be here or there 'l " And then I pointed to the
sea. All evils are to be considered with the good that is in
them, and with what worse attends them.

Then it occurred to me again, how well I was furnished for
my subsistence, and what Would have been my case if it had
not ha )pcned (which was a hundred thousand to one) that the
ship _ oatcd from the place where she first struck, and was
driven so near to the shore, that I had time to get all these
things out of her; what would have been my case, if I had
been to have lived in the condition in which I at lirst came on
shore, without necessaries ol'lit'e, or necessaries to supply and
procure them? " Particularly," said I aloud (though to my-
self), " what should I have done without a gun, without ammu-
nition, without any tools to make any thing, or to work with,
without clothes,'beddinj, a tent, or any manner of covering? "
and that now I had all t rose to a sullicient quantity, and was
ina fair way to provide myself in such a manner as to live
Without my pun, when my ammunition was spent; so that 1
had a tolerah c View of subsisting, without any want as long as
I lived; for I considered, from the beginning, how! should
provide for the accidents that might happen, and for the time
that was to come, not only after my ammunition should be
spent, but even after my health or strength should decay.

' I confess, I had not entertained any notion of my ammnni~
"on being destroyed at one blast, I mean my powder being
blown up by lightning; and this made the thoughts of it so
surprxsmg to me, when it lightened and thundered, as I ob
served just now.

And now, being to enter in to a melancholy relation of a scene
ofstlcnt life, such, perhaps, as was never heard of in the world
before, I shall take it from its beginning, and continue it in its
order. It was, by my account the 30th of September when,
in the manner as above said, 1' first set my foot upon this hor-
rid island; when the sun, being to us in its autumnal equinox,
was almost just over my "head ; for I reckoned myself, by ob-
servation, to be in the latitude of 9 degrees 22 minutes north
of the Line.

After I had been there about ten or twelve days, it came into
my thoughts that I should lose my reckonin of time for want
of books, and pen and ink, and should even orget the Sabbath
days from the working days; but, to prevent this, I cut it-with
my knife upon a large post, in capital letters; and making it
into a reat cross, I set it up on the shore where I first landed,
viz. " came on shore here on the 30th of September, 1659.'
Upon the sides of this square post I cut ever ay a notch with
my knife, and every seventh notch was as ong again as'the
rest, and every first day of the month as long ain as that
lon one -. and thus I kept my calendar, or. week y, monthly,
an yeariy' reckoning of time. .

But it ap ened .that among the many things which 1
brought out oi? the s p, in the several voyageS'which, as above
mentioned, I made to it, I got several things of less value, but
not at all less useful to me, .which'I found, some time after, in
rummaging the chests; as, In particular, pens, ink, and paper;
several parcels in the captain s, mate's, gunner'l, and carpen-
ter's keeping; three or four compasses, some mathematical
instruments dials p'ers ctives, charts, and books of naviga-
tion; all which I ud ed together, whether 1 might want
them or no: also I found three very good Bibles, which came
to me in my cargo from England, an which I had packed up
among my things; some Portuguese books also, and, among
them, two or three popish prayer books and several other
books, all which 1 careful] secured. And I must not forget,
that we had in the ship a o , an two cats, of whose eminent
history I may have occasion to . somethin , in its place;
for I carried both the cats with me; and as for the dog, he.

day alter I went on shore with my first cargo, and was a
trust servant to me for many years: I wanted nothin that he
coul fetch me, nor any company that he could in e up to
me; I only wanted to have him talk to me; buttliat would not
do. As I observed before, I found pens, ink, and paper, and
I husbanded them to the utmost; and I shall show that while
my ink lasted, I kept things very exact, but alter that was
gone I could not; ,for I coul not make any ink, by any means
that I could devise. _ ~

And this put me in mind that I wanted many thin , not-
withstanding all thatI had amassed together; and 0 these,
this of ink was one; as also a Spade, pickaxe, and shovel, to
dig or remove the earth; needles, ins, and thread: as for
linen, I soon learned to want that Wi out much dificulty.

This want of tools made every work I did oon_ heavily;
and it was near a whole ear before I had entirely finished my
little pale, or surround my habitation. The piles or stakes,
which were as heavy as I could well lift, were a long time in
cutting and preparing in the woods, and more, by far, in
brin ing home; so that I 3 nt sometimes two days in cutting
and ringing home one of ose posts, and a third day in driv-
ing it into the ground; for which purpose, I got a heav piece
of wood at first, but at last bethouglit myself of one of e iron
crows; which, however, though I ound it, yet it made driving
these posts or piles very laborious and tedious work. But
whatneed I have been concerned at the tediousness of any
thing I had to do, seeing I had time enou h to do it in? nor
had any other employment, if that had _ n over, at least
that I could foresee, except the ranging the island to seek lbr
food; which I did, more or less, every day. . _

I now began to consider seriously my condition, and the
circumstance I was reduced to; and I-drew up the stateof
my affairs in writing, not so much to leave them to any that
were to come alter me (fan! was like to have but few heirs)
as to deliver my thoughtffrom daily poring upon-thew

aflictinf'my mind; and as my began nowto

  

.:.my despondcucy, I began to comfort myself as well as I could,
and to set the good against the evil, that I mi ht have some-
thing to distinguish my case from worse; an I stated very
impartially, like debtor and creditor, the comforts I enjoyed
against the miseries I suffered, thus :--

Evu.

I our cast in on a horrible, deso-
late island, vord of all hope of re-
covery.

I am singled out and so ted,
as it were, from all the world, to
he miserable.

I am divided from mankind, a
solitaire; one banished from hu-
man society.

I have no clothes to cover me.

I am without any defence, or
moans to resist any violence of
man or beast.

Goon.

But I am alive ; and not drown-
ed, as all my ship's company were.

But I am singled out, too, from
all the ship's crew, to be spared
from death; and He that miracu-
lously saved me from death, can
deliver me from this condition.

But I am not starved, and r-
ishing in a barren place, ali'or ing
no sustenance. -'. . "M

But I am in a hot climate, where, _
if I had clothes, I could hardly
wear them.

But I am cast on an island
where I see no wild beast to hurt

me, as I saw on the coast of Al'-
' rica; and what if I had been ship-
wrecked there?

But God wonderfully sent the
ship in near enough to the shore,
that I have got out so many neces-
sary things as will either supply
my wants, or enable me to supply
myself, even as long as _I live.

Ihaveano soul to speak to, or
relieve me.

Upon the whole, here was an undoubted testimony, that
there was scarce any condition in the world so miserable, but
there was something negative, or something positive, to be
thankful for in it; and let this stand as a direction, from the ._
experience of the most miserable of all conditions in this world,'
that we may always find in: it something to comfortourselves

from, and to set, in the description of good and evil, on the
credit side of the account.

Haying now brought my mind a little to relish my condition,
and given over looking out. to sea, to see if I could spy a ship;
I say, giving over these things, I began to apply myself to ac-
commodate my way of livmg, and to make things as easy to
me as I could.

I have alread described my habitation, which was a tent
under the side 0 a rock, surrounded with a strong ale of posts
and cables; but I might now rather call it a wall, or I raised a
kind of wall against it of turfs, about two feet thick on the out-
side; and afier some time (I think it was a year and a half)
[raised rafiers from it leaning to the rock, and thatched or
covered it with boughs of trees and such things as I could get,-
to keep out the rain; which I found, at some times of the year,
very Violent. .

I have already observed how I brought all my goods. into
this ale, and into the cave which I ad made behind me.
But fmust observe, too, that at first this was a confused hea
of goods, which as they lay in no order, so they took u
my place: Ihad no room to turn myself: so I set my' f to
enlarge my cave, and Work farther into the earth' for it was
a loom, sandy rock, which yielded easily to the labor I be-
stowed on it; and when I found I was pretty safe as to the
beasts of prey, I worked sideways to the right hand, into the
rock, and then, turning to the rig t again, worked quite out,
and made me a door to come out in the outside of my pale or
fortification. .

This gave me not only egress and regress, as it were, a back.
way to my tent and to my storehouse, but gave me room to
stow my goods. '

And now I began 'to apply myself to. make such necessary
things as I found I most wanted, articularly a chair and a
table - for without these 1 was not ab e to enjoy the few coinfims
I had in the world' I could not write, or eat, or do several,
things with so much pleasure, without a table: sol went- to'

work. And here I must needs observe, that as reason is the
substance and original of the mathematics, so, by stating and
squaring every thin by reason, and by making the most ra-
tional judgment of t ings every man ma be, In time, master
of every mechanic art. I, had never han led a tool in my life '
and et, in time, b labor, application, and contrivance,
found: at last, that wanted nothing but I could have made,
especially if I had had tools. However,l made abundance of
things, even without tools; and some with no more tools than
an adze and a hatchet, which erha s were never made that
way before, and that with in nite abor. For example, if I
wanted a board, I had no other way but to cut down a tree,
set it on an edge before me, and hew it flat on either side with
my axe, till I had brought it to be as thin as a plank, and then ~
dub It smooth with my adze. It is true, by this method I . -
could make but one board of a whole tree; but this I had no
remed for but atience, any more than I had for a prodigious
deal 0 time an labor which it took me up to make a plank or
board; but m time or labor was little worth, and so it was as
well employ one way as another.

However, I made me a table and a chair, as I observed
above, in the first place; and 'this i did out of the short pieces
of boards that I brought on my rail from the ship. But when
I wrought out some boards as above, I made large'shelves, of
the breadth of a foot and a half, one over another, all along one
side of my cave, to lay all my tools, nails, and iron-work on;
and, in a word, to separate every thin at large in their places,
that 1 might easily come at them. I "knocked pieces into the
wall of the rock, to hang my guns, and all things that would
hang up; so that had my cave been seen, it looked like a gen-
eral magazine of all necessary things; and I had every thing
so ready at my hand, that it was a great--pleasure to me to see
all my goods in such order, and especially to find my stock of
all necessaries so great.

And now it was that I began to keep a journal of ever
day's employment; for, indeed, at first, I was in too muhurry, and not on] hurry as to labor, but in much discompo- i
sure of mind; an my journal would, too, have been full of .
many dull things; for example, I must have said thus-- '
",Scpt. 30th. After I had got to shore, and had escaped drown. {
ing, instead of being thanka toGod for my deliverance, having I
first vomited, with the great quantity of salt water which was

gotten into my stomach, and recovering in self a little, I ran l
about the shore, wringing my hands, an beating my head

and face, exclaimin' at my misery, and cr ing out, 'I was i
undone, undone!' t' l, tired and faint, I was orced to lie down '
on the ground to repom, but durst not sleep, for fear of being
devoured." l

Some days after this and after I had been' on board the ;
ship, and got all that I could out of her, I could not forbear I
getting up to the top of a little mountain, and looking out to 5
sea, in hopes of seeing a ship; then fancy that, at a vast dis-- ,
tance, I spied a sail, please myself with the hopes of _it, and
after lookm steadily till I was almost blind, lose it quite, and
is)it dew? and weep like a child, and thus increase my misery '

y my 0 .

But havihg gotten over these things in some measure, and
having settled my household-stuff and habitation, made me a
table, and a chair, and all as handsome about me as I could I
began to keep my journal; of which I shall here give you t e
copy (though in it will be told all these particulars over again)
las ong as "1' lasted; for, having no more ink, I was forced to
cave it o .

THE JOURNAL.

September 30th, 1659. 1, poor, miserable Robinson Crusoe, ~.
being shipwrecked, during a dreadful storm, in the offing
came on shore'on this dismal, unfortunate island, which I 3
called the ISLAND or DESPAIR; all the rest of the ship's com-
pany being drowned, and myself almost dead.Crusoe bringing his Rafi ashore.
All the rest of that day I spent in afflicting myself at the
dismal circumstances I was brought to, viz. I had neither food,
house, clothes, weapon, nor place to fl to; and in despair
of any relief, saw nothing but death be ore me; that I should
either be devoured by Wild beasts, murdered by savages, or
starved to death for want of food. At the approach of night I
slept in_a tree, for fear of wild creatures; ut slept soundly,
though it rained all night. .

October 1. In the mornin I saw, to my great surprise the
ship had floated with the hig tide, and was driven on 3 re
again much nearer the island; which, as it was some comfort
on one hand (for seeing her sit upright, and not broken in
pieces, I hoped, if the Wind abated, I might get on board, and

et some food and necessaries out of her for in relief), so on
t e other hand, it renewed ml grief at the loss my comrades,
who, I im ined, if we ha all staid on board, might have
saved the s m, or, at least, that they would not have been all
drowned, as ey were; and that, had the men been saved,
we might perhaps have built us a boat, out of the ruins of the
ship, to have carried us to some other partof the world. I
5 nt great part of this day in p'erplexing myself on these
ings; but, stlength seeing the 8 ip almost dry I went upon
the sand_as near as Icould, and then swam on board. This
day also'it continued raining, thoughwith no wind at all.
tom the lstof Octaba' to the 24th. ' All these days entirely
spent in .many several voyages to get all I could'out of the
s ip ' which I brouggton shore, eve tide offlood1up9n rafts.
Much rain also in se days, thong with some intervals of
fair weather - but it seems this was the rainy season.
_ Oct. 20. Ioverset my raft, and all the goods I had got upon
it; but being in shoal water, and the t in 8 being chiefly
bevy, I recovered man of them when the ti e was out.

.Oct. 25.. It rained al ' ht and all day, with some usts of
wind; during which time e sh'iy broke in pieces (t e wind
blowing a little harder than be ore) and was no more to be
seen, except the wreck of her, and that only at low water. I

1% t
spent this day in covering and securing the goods which I hae
saved, that the rain might not spoil them.

Oct. 26. Iwalked about the shore almost all day, to find
out a place to fix my habitation; greatly concerned to secure
mysel from any attack in the night, either from wild beasts or
men. Towards night I fixed upon a roper place, under a
rock, and marked out a semicircle or my encampment;
which I resolved to strengthen with a work, wall, or fortifica-
tion, made of double piles, lined within with cables, and with-
out with turf.

From the 26th to the 30th, I worked very hard in carr ing
all my goods to my new habitation, though some part 0 the
time it rained exceedingly hard.

The 3lst, in the morning, I went out into the island with
my gun, to seek for some food, and discover the country;
when] killed a sh oat, and her kid followed me home, which
I afterwards killed so, because it would not feed.

November 1. I set up' my tent under a rock, and lay there
for the first night; ma ing it as large as I could, with stakes
driven in to swmg my hammock upon.

Nov. 2. I set up all my chests and boards, and the pieces
of timber which made my rafts; and with them formed a fence
round me, a little within the place I had marked out for my
fortification. .

Nov. 3. I went out with my gun, and killed two fowls like
ducks, which were very ood food. In the afiemoon I went
to work to make me a ta le. '

Nov. 4. This morning I began to order my hm of work,
of going out with my_ gun time of sleep, and time of diver-
aion; v12. every morning l'walked out With my gun for two
or three hours, if it did not rain; then employled myself
to work till about eleven o'clock; then atewhatl ed to live
on; and from twelve to two I lay down to sleep, the weather
being excessive hot; and then, In the evening, to work again.
The working part of this day and the next was wholly em-
ployed in making my table, for I was yet but a very sorry

is
workman; though time and necessity made me a complete
uaturlal mechanic soon after, as I believe they would any
one e se.

Nos. 5. This day went abroad with my and dog, and
killed a wild eat; her skin prett soft, but er flesh good for
nothing: of every creature that killed I took of the skins,
and preserved them. Comin back by the sea-shore, I saw
many sorts of mas-fowl which did not understand; but was
surprised .and almost frightened, with two or three seals;
which, while I was azing at them (not well knowing what
the were), ct into sea, and esca me for that time.

as. 6. her my morning walk, went to.work with my
table a sin, and finished it, though not to my hking; nor was
it long fore I learned to mend it. .-

Nov. 7. Now it began to be settled fair weather. The 7th,
8th, 9th, 10th, and part of the 12th (for the 11th was Sunday,
accordion to my reckoning , 1 took wholly up to make me a
chair, am?! with much ado, rought it to a tolerableshge, but
never to please me; and, even in the making, I pull it in
pieces several times. -

Note. I soon neglected my keeping Sundays; for omi '
my mark for them on my post I orgot which was.wliich.

Nov. 13. This day it rained; which refreshed me exceed-

in ly, and cooled the earth; but it was accompanied with ter-
rib e thunder and li htning, which frightened me dreadfully,
for fear of my pow er. As soon as it was over, I resolved to
separate my stock of powder into as many little parcels as

possible, that it might not be in danger. . _ . _
. Nov. l4, 15, 16. These three _days I s at in making little
'eeq'iiare chests or boxes which might hol about a pound. or
twolpounds at most, of powder; and so, putting the powder
in, stowed it in places as secure and as remote from one
another as possible. On one of these threads s] W.'

Note. Three things I wanted exceedingly for this work
viz. a ickaxe, a shovel, and a wheelbarrow, or basket; so I
desiste from in work, and began to consider how to supply
these wants, an make me some tools. As for a pickaxe,l
made use of the iron crows, which were proper enou h, though
heav ; but the next thing was a shove or s ade; t iis was so
ah utel necessary, that, indeed, I could 0 nothing effect--
uall wit out it; but what kind of one to make I knew not.

lav. 18. The next day, in searching the woods, I found a
tree of that wood, or like it, which, in the Brazils, they call
the iron tree, from its exceeding hardness: of this, with great
labor, and almost spoiling my axe, I cut a piece, and brought
it home, too, with difficulty enough, for it was exceeding
heavy. The excessive hardness of the wood, and my havin
no other way, made me 3. Ion while upon this machine; for
worked it effectually, bv lit e and little, into the form of a
shovel or spade; the andle exactly shaped likeours in England,
only that the broad part havinino iron shod upon it at bottom,
it would not last me so long: owever, it served well enough
for the uses which I had occasion to put it to; but never
was :_shovel, I believe, made after that fashion, or solong
a-ma mo: .

I was itill deficient; for I wanted a basket, or a wheelbaro
now. A basket I could not make by any means, having no
such things as twi s that would bend to make Wicker ware;
atJeast none yet ound out; and as to the wheelbarrow, I
fanciedI could make all but the wheel, but that I had no notion
of; neither did I know how to go about it: besides,l had no
possible way to make iron gudgeons for the spindle or axis of
the wheel to run In: so I gave it over: and, for carrying awn _
the earth which I dug out of the cave, I made me a thingji
a had, which the laborers carry mortar in for the bricklaye'rs.
This was not so diflicult to me as the making the shovel; and
yet this and the shovel, and the attempt which I made in min
to make a wheelbarrow, took me up no less than four days;
I mean always excepting my morning walk with my gun."5'

which I seldom omitted, and very seldom failed also bringing
home something fit to,eat. _

Nov. 23. My other Work having now stood still, because of
my making these tools, when they were finished I went on '
and, working every day, as my strength and time allowed, i
spent eighteen days entirely in Widening .and deepening my
cave, that it might hold my goods commodiously.

Note. _During all this time, I worked to make this room, or
cave, spacious enough to accommodate me as a warehouse or
magazme, a kitchen, a dining-room, and a cellar. As tbr a
lodging, I kept to the tent; except that, sometimes, in the wet
season of the year, it rained so hard that I could not keep my-
self dry; which caused meafierwards to cover all in place
Within my pale with long poles, in the form of rafters, amng
against the rock, and loaded them With flags and large leaves
0 trees, like a thatch.

December 10. I an now to think my care or vault fin-
ished; when on a sud en gt seems I had made it too large! a
great quantity of earth lie down from the top and one si e;
so much, that in short, it frightened me, and not without rea-
son too; for if I had been under it, I should never have want-
ed a grave-digger. Upon this disaster, I had a great deal of
work to do over sin, for I had the lm earth to carry out;

more I had the roof secured; and the phosts, standing in rows,

Dec. 26. No rain; and the earth much cooler than before,
and pleasanter.

Dec. 27. Killed a young goat; and lamed another, so that
l catched it and led it home in a strin : when I had it home,
I bound and splintered up its leg, whic was broke.

N. B. I took such care of it that it lived; and the leg grew
well, and as strong as ever ' but, by nursincr it so long, it rew
tame, and fed upon the little green at my door, and won] not
go away. This was the first time that I entertained a thought
of breeding up some tame creatures, that I might have food
when my powder and shot was all spent.

BLT. 23, 29, $0, 31. Great heats, and no breeze; so that
there was no stirring abroad, except in the evening, for food:
this time I spent in putting all my things in order Within doors.

January 1. Very hot still;'but I went abroad early and
late with my gun, and lay still in the middle of the day. This
evening, going farther Into the valleys which lay towards the
centre of the island, I found there was plenty of oats, though
exceeding shy, and hard'to come at; however, resolved to
try if I could not bring my dog to hunt them down. Accord-
ingly, the next day, went out with m dog and set him
upon the goats: but I was mistaken, for t y all faced about
upon the 0g; and he knew his danger too well, for he would
not come near them.

Jan. 3. I began m fence or wall; which, being still jealous
of my being attache by somebody, I resolved to make very
thick and strong.

N. B. This wall being described before, I purposely omit
what was said in the journal: it is sufficient to observe, that I
was no less time than from the 3d of January to the ch of
April, working, finishing, and perfecting this wall: though it83

 

 

Crusoe {93C/de hln tune Goat.
was no more than about 25 yards in length, being a half-circle,

from one place in the rock to another place, about twelve

yards from it, the door of the cave being in the centre,
eliind it.

All this time I worked very hard; the rains hindering me
many days, nay, sometimes weeks together: but I thou ht I
should never be perfectly secure till this wall was finis ed;
and it is scarce credible what inexpressible labor every thing
was done with, especially the bringing piles out of the woods,
and driving them into the ground; for I made them much big-
ger than I needed to have done.

When this wall was finished, and the outside double-knced,
with a turf-wall raised up close to it, I persuade in self that
if any people were to come on shore there, they woul not r-
ceive any thing like a habitation; and it was very well did
so, as may be observed hereafter, upon a very remarkable
occasion. . '

During this time, I made my rounds in the woods for game
every day, when the rain permitted me, and made fre uent
discoveries, in these walks of something or other to my van-
tage; particularly, I found a kind of Wild pi us, who build,
not as wood-pigeons, in a tree, but rather as use-pigeons, in
the holes of the rocks: and, taking some young ones, I en-
deavored to breed them up tame, and did so: but when they

w older the. flew all away; which, perhaps, was at first
g: want of fee ing them, for I had nothing to ve them: how-
' ever I frequently tound their nests, and got ieir young ones,
which were very good meat. . And now, in the managing my
household afi'airs, I found myself wantin in many things,
which I thought at first it was imposstble or me to make, as
indeed, as to some of them it was: for Instance I could never
make a cask to be hooped. I had a small runiet or two, as]
observed before; but 1 could never arrive to the capacity of
making one by them, though I spent many weeks about it; 1
could neither put in the heads, nor join the staves so true toona
another as to make them hold water; so I gave that also over.noinxscx encsoit. 85

In the next place, 1 was at a great loss for candles; so that as
soon as it was dark, which was generally by seven o'clock, I
was obliged to go to bed. I remember the lump ofbees--wat
with which I made candles in my African adventure; but I
had none of that now; the only remedy I had was, that when
I had killed a goat, 1 saved the tallow; and with a little dish
made of clay, which I baked in the sun, to which I added it
wick of some oakum, I made me a lam ); and this gave me
light, though not a clear, steady light, hire a candle. In the
nnddle of all my labors it happened, that, in rummaging my
things, I found a little bag; which, as I hinted before, had
been filled with corn, for the feeding of poultry; not for this
voyage, but before, as I suppose, when the ship came from
Lisbon. What little remainder of corn had been in the bug
was all devoured with the rats, and I saw nothing in the bag
but husks and dust; and being willing to have the bag tor
some other use (1 think it was to put powder in, when 1 di-
vided it tor fear of the lightning, or some such use), I shook
the husks of corn out of it, on one side of my fortification,
under the rock.

It was a little before the great rain just now mentioned, that
I threw this stuff away; taking no notice of any thing, and
not so much as remembering that 1 had thrown any thin"
there; when about a month after I saw some few stalks o
something green shootin out of the ground, which I fancied
might be some plant I ha not seen; but I was surprised, and
perfectly astoniehed, when, after a little longer time,I saw
about ten or twelve ears come out, which were perfect green
gwiey, of the same kind as our European, nay, as our English

ar ey.

It is impossible to express the astonishment and confusion
of m . thoughts on this occasion: I had hitherto acted upon
no re igious foundation at all ; indeed, I had very few notions of
religion in in head, nor had entertained any sense of any
thing that h befallen me, otherwise than as chance, or, as
we ightly say, what pleases God; without so much as in-
guiring into the end of Providence in these things, or his order
in governm events in the world. But after I saw barley grow
there,_in a c imate which I knew was not roper for corn, and
especially as I knew not how it came tliere, it startled me
strangely; andI began to su gest, that God had miraculously
caused this grain to row wit out any help of seed sown, and
that it was so directe purely for my sustenance, on that wild,
miserable place.

This touched my heart a little, and brou ht tears out of my
eyes; and I began to bless myself that suc a prodig' of na-
ture should happen upon my account: and this was t e more
strange to mehbecause I saw near it still, all along by the side
of the rock, some other stragglinn' stalks, which proved to be
stalks of rice, and which I knew, cause I had seen it grow
in Africa, when I was ashore there.

I not only thought these the pure roductions of Providence
for my support, but, not doubtino' t at there was more in the

lace, I went over all that part olP the island where I had been
fore, searchintIr in every corner, and under every rock, for
more of it; but fcould not find any. At last it occurredto my
thoughts, that I had shook out a bag of chicken's-meat In that
place, and then the wonder began to cease ; and I must confess,
my religious thankfulness to God's providence began to abate
too, upon the discovering that all his was nothing but what
was common; though I ought to have been as thankful for so
strange and unforeseen a providence, as If it had been mirac-
ulous; for it was really the work of Providence, as to me, that
should order or appoint that ten or twelve grains of corn should
remain unspoiled, when the rats had destroyed all the rest, as if
it had been dropped from heaven; as also, that I should throw
it out in that particular place, where, It being in the shade
of a high roc , it sprang up Immediately; whereas, if I had
thrown it any where else, at that time, it would have been
burnt up and destroyled. . _

I carefully saved t e ears of this corn, you may be sure, In

their season, which was about the end of June; and, laying up
every com, I resolved to sow them all again; hoping, in time,
to have some quantity sufficient to su ply me With bread,
But it was not till the fourth year that l could allow myself
the least grain of this corn to eat, and even then, but sparingly

3131 shall show afterwards, in its order; for I lost all that I
sowed the first season, by not observinr the proper time; as l
sowed just before the dr season, so 2 mt it never came up at
all at least not as it won d have done; of which in its place.

Besides this barley, there were, as above, twenty or thirty
stalks of rice, which I preserved with the same care; and
whose use was of the same kind, or to the same purpose, viz.
to make me bread, or rather food ; for l limnd ways to cool: it
up without baking, though I did that also after some time.--
But to return to my journal.

I worked excessively hard these three or lhur mouths, to get
any wall done; and the 14th of April I closed it up; contriv-
iug to get into it, not by a door, but over the wall, by a ladder,
that there might be no sign on the outside of my habitation.

April 16. I finished the ladder; so I went up with the
ladder to the top and then pulled it up aller me, and let it
down in the ins: 6: this was a complete inclosure to me; for
within I had room enough, and nothing could come at me
from without, unless it could first mount my wall.

The very next day after this wall was finished, I had almost
all In labor overthrown at once, and myself killed: the case
wast us :---As 1 was busy in the inside of it, behind my tent
just at the entrance into my cure, I was terribly frightened
with a most dreadful surprising; thing indeed; for, all on a
sudden, I found the earth come crumbling down from the roof
of my cave, and from the edge of the hill over my head, and
two of the osts I had set up in the care cracked in a frightful
manner. was heartily scared; but thought nothing of what
really was the cause, only thinking that the top of my care was
falling in, as some of it had done before; and for fear I should
be buried iujt, I ran forward to my ladder, and not thinking
myself safe there neither,l got over my wall for lie 1r of the
pieces of the hill which 1 expected might roll down it n me.
had no sooner stepped down upon the firm groun , thanl
plainly saw It was a terrible earthquake; for the ground I
stood on shook three times at about eight minutes' distance,
with three such shocks as would have overturned the strongest
building that could be supposed to have stood on the earth;
and a great piece of the top of a rock, which stood about half
a mile from me, next the sea, fell down with such a terrible
noise as I never heard in all my life. I erceived also, that
the very sea was put into a violent motion by it; and I believe
the shocks were stronger under the water than on the island.

I was so much amazed with the thing itself (having never
felt the like, nor discoursed with any one that had), that I was
' like one dead or stupefied; and the motion of the earth made
my stomach sick, like one that was tossed at sea : but the noise
ot' the falling of the rock awaked me, as it were; and rousing
me from the stu fied condition I was in, filled me with horror
and I thought 0 nothing but the hill falling upon my tent and
my household goods, and burying all at once: this sunk my
very soul within me a second time. .

After the third shock was over, and I felt no more for some
time, I began to take courage; yet 1 had not heart enough to
go over my wall again, for ear of being buried alive but sat
still upon the ground, greatly cast down, and disconsolate, not
knowmg what to do", All this while, I had not the least serious
religious thou ht; mthing but the common Lord, have mercy
upon me! a l when it was over, that went away too.

While 1 t- it thus, I found the air overcast, and grow cloudy
as if it won d rain; and soon after the wind rose by little an
little, so th t in less than half an hour it blew a most dreadful
hurricane: the sea was, all on a sudden, covered with foam
and froth; the shore was covered with a breach of the water;
the trees were torn up by the roots; and a terrible storm it
was. This held about three hours, and then be an to abate;
and in two hours more it was quite calm, and, gan to rain
very hard. All this while I sat upon the ground, very much
terrified and dejected; when, on a sudden, it came into my
thoughts, that these winds and rain being the consequence of
the earthquake, the earthquake itself was spent and over, and
I might venture into my cave again. With this thought my
spirits began to revive; and the rain also helping to persuade
me I went in, and sat down in my tent; but the rain was so
violent, that my tent was ready to be beaten down with it;
and I was forced to get into my cave, though very much
afraid and uneasy, for fear it should fall on my head. This
violent rain forced me to a new work, viz. to cut a hole through
mg new fortification, like a sink, to let the water go out,
w ich would else have drowned my cave. After I had been
in my (mm for seine time, and found no more shocks of the
earthquake follow, I began to be more composed. And now
to support my spirits, which, indeed, wanted it very much, I
went to at little store, and took a small sup of rum; which
however, did then, and always, very sparingly, knowingl
could have no more when that was gone. It continued raining
all that night, and great part of the next day, so that I could
not stir abroad; but my mind being more composed, I began
to think of what I had best do; concluding, that if the island
was subject to these earthquakes there would be no livin for
me in a cave, but I must consider of buildin me some fittle
hut in an open place, which I might surrount With a wall, as
I had done here, and so make myself secure from wild beasts
or men; for if I staid whereI was, I shbuld certainly, one
time or other, be buried alive.

With these thoughts, I resolved to remove my tent from the
place where it now stood, being 'ust under the hanging preci.
pice of the hill, and which, if it should be shaken a ain, would
certainly fall upon my tent. I spent the two next a '8, being
the 19th and 20th or April, in contriving where an how to
remove my habitation. The fear of being swallowed alive
affected me so, that I never slept in quiet; and yet the appre-
benston of lying abroad, without any fence, was almost equal

to it: but mild when I looked about, and saw how every thing
was put in order, how pleasantly l was concealed, and how
safe ram danger, it made me very loth to remove. In the
mean time, it occurred to me that it would require a vast deal
of time for me to do this; and that I must be contented to run
the risk where I was, till I had formed a convenient cam , and
secured it so as to remove to it. With this conclusion com-
posed myself for a time ; and resolved that I would go to work
with all speed to build me a wall with piles and cables, &c., in
a circle, as before, and set up my tent in it when it was tin-
ished; but that I would venture to stay where l was till it was
ready and fit to remove to. This was the 2lst.

April 22. The next morning, I be an to consider of means
to put this measure into execution; at I was at 3 eat loss
about the tools. I had three lar axes, and abun ance of
hatchets (for we carried the hate ts for traffic with the In-
dians); but with much chopping and cutting knotty, hard wood,
they were all full of notches, and dull; and though I had a
grindstone, I could not turn it and grind my tools too. This
caused me as much thought as a statesman would have be-
stowed upon a rand point of politics, or a judge upon the
life and death 0 a man. At length I contrived a wheel with
a' string, to turn It with my foot, that I might have both my
hands at Hm.

Note. I ' never seen any such thin in England, or, at
least, not to take notice how It was done; t ough since, I have
observed it is-v'ery cemmon there: besides that, my rindstone
was very large and heavy. This machine cost me a ull week's
work to bring it to perfection.

April 28, 29. ese two whole days I took up in grinding
my tools;i my machine for turning my grindstone performing

111-5130. Having rceived that my bread had been low a
great while, I now too a survey of it, and reduced myself to
one biscuit-cake a day, which made my heart very heavy.

Hay 1. In the momingfiilnookrng toward the sea-side, the
tide beinglowJ sawsorne 3 been the shore bigger than
ordinary, and it looked like a cask: when I came to it I found
asmall barrel, and two or three pieces of the wrec of the
shi ), which were driven on shore by the late hurricane; and
loolung towards the wreck itself, I thought it seemed to lie
higher out of the water than it used to do. 1 examined the
barrel that was driven on shore, and soon found it was a barrel
of gunpowder; but it had taken water, and the powder was
caked as hard as a stone; however, 1 rolled it further on the
shore for the present, and went on upon the sands, as near as
I could to the wreck of the ship, to look for more.

When I came down to the ship,l found it strangely re-
moved. The forecastle, which lay before buried in sand, was
heaved up at least six feet; and the stern (which was broke to
pieces, and parted lrom the rest, by the force of the sen, soon
after I had left rummaging of her was tossed, as it were, up,
and cast on one side; and the san was thrown so high on that
side next her stern, that 1 could now walk quite up to her
when the tide was out; whereas there was a great piece of
water before, so that I could not come within a. quarter of a.

anile of the wreck without swimming. 1 was surprised With
this at first, but soon concluded it must be done by the earth-
(puke; and as by this Violence the ship was more broke open
t ran formerly, so man thin 5 came daily on shore, which the
sea had loosened, an whic the winds and water rolled by
degrees to the land.

'hls wholly diverted m thoughts from the desi n of remov-
mg my habitation; and busied myself mi htiFy, that day
especially, in searching whether I could ma e an way into
the ship; hut I found nothing was to be expected 0 that kind,
for all the Inside of the ship was choked up with sand. How-
ever, as I had learned not to despair of any thin , I resolved
to pull every thing to ieces that I could of the s i , conclu-
dutg that every thing could get from her would be 0 some use
or other to me.

May 3. I_ be an with my saw, and out a piece of a been
through, which thought held some of the upper part or quar-
ter-deck together; and when I had cut it through I cleared
away the sand as well as I could from the side which lay high-
est; but the tide coming in, I was obliged to give over for
that time.

.5103] 4. I went a-fishing, but caught not one fish that l
durst eat of, till I was weary of my sport; when, 'ust going to
leave ofi',I caught a young dolphin. I had ma e me along
line of some rope-yarn, but I had no books: yet I frequently
cau ht fish enough as much as I cared to'.eat; all which
drie in the sun and ate them dry.

.May 5. Worked on the wreck; out another beam asunder,
and brought three reat fir-planks off from the decks; which
I tied together, an made swrm on shore when the tide of flood
came on.

May 6. Worked on the wreck; got several iron bolts out
of her, and other pieces of iron-work; worked ver hard,
and came home very much tired, and had thoughts giving
It over.

May 7. Went to the wreck gain, but not with an intent to
work; but found the weight the wreck had broke itself
down, the beams bein cut; that several ieces of the ship
seemed to lie loose; an the inside of the h d lay so open that
I could see into it; but almost full of water and sand.

May 8. Went to the _wreck, and carried an iron crow to
(wrench up the deck, which lay now quite clear of the water
and sand. I wrenched u two lanks, and brought them on
shore also with the tide. let} iron crow in the wreck for
next day.

May 9. Went to the wreck and with the crow made way
into the body of the wreck, and felt several casks, and loosened
them with the crow but could not break'them up. I felt
also a roll of EnghSh lead, and could stir it; but u was too
heavy toremove. - 1 S

piece off the roll of lead, by placing the edge of one hatchet,
and driving it with the other; but as it lay about a toot and a
half in the \vatcr,l could not make any blow to drive the
hatchet.

Mm 16. It had blown hard in the night, and the wreck ap-
peare more broken by the force of the water; but I_st:ud so
ong in the woods, to get pitreons lbr lood, that the tide pre-
vented my going to the wredit that day.

[Way 17. 1 saw some pieces of the wreck blown on shore, at
a great distance, two miles off me, but resolved to see what
they were, and found it was a piece of the head, but too heavy
tbr me to brinnr away.

May 24. Fli'cry da ', to this day, I worked on the wreck;
and with hard labor I loosened some things so much with the
crow, that the first blowing tide, several casks floated out, and
two of the seamen's chests; but the wind blowing from the
shore, nothing came to land that day but pieces of timber,
and a hogshead, which had some Brazil pork in it; but the
salt-water and the sand had spoiled it. I continued this work
every day to the 15th of June, except the time necessary to
get tood; winchI always appointed, during this art of my
employment, to be when the tide was up, that I mig t be ready
when it was ebbed out; and by this time I had gotten timber.
and plank, and iron-work, enough to have built a good boat,

several pieces, near one hundred weight of the sheet-lead.

June 16. Goin down to the sea-Side, I found a large tor-
torse, or turtle. 'his was the first I had seen; which, it
seems, was only m ' misfortune, not any defect of the place or
scarcity; for had hap ened to be on the other side of the
island, I might have ha hundreds of them every day, as i
found afterwards; but perhaps had paid dear enough for them.

June 21. Very ill; frightened almost to death With the ap-

confused.

June 22. A little better; but under dreadful apprehensions

June 23. Very had again; cold and shivering, and then a
violent headache.

Jam: 24. Much better.

June 25. An ague very violent: the fit held me seven hours;
cold fit, and hot, with faint sweats after it.

Jam: 26. Better; and having no victuals to eat, took my
gun, hut found myself very weak 2 however, I killed a she-goat,
and With much difliculty got it home, and broiled some of it,
and ate. 1 would fain have stewed it, and made some broth,
but had no pot.

June 27, The agne again so violent that I lay a-hed all day,
and neither ate nor drank. I was ready to perish for thirst;
but so weak, I had not strength to stand up, or to get myself
any water to drink. Frayed to God again, but was light-
headed: and when I was not, 1 was so ignorant that I knew
not what tosay; onl lay and cried, "Lord, look upon
mel Lord, pity me! and, have mercy upon me!" [sup~
pose I did nothing else for two or three hours; till, the fit wean
mot? I fell asleep, and did not wake till far in the night.

en l awoke, I found myself much refreshed, but weak, and
exceedizig thirsty: however, as I had no water in my whole '
habitation, l was forced to lie till morning, and went to slee
again. in this second sleep, I had this terrible dream:
thought that I was sittin on the ground, on the outside of my
Wall, where I sat when t e storm blew after the earthfiuake, .
and that I saw a man descend from a rest black clou , in a
bright flame of fire, and light it n e ground: he was all
over as bright as a flame, so that could but just bear to look
towards him; his countenance was most inexpressibly dread-
ful, impossible for words to describe: when he ste ped upon
the ground with his feet, I thought the earth tremb ed, just as
it had done before in the earth uake; and all the air looked,
to my apprehension, as if it had it filled with flashes of fire.
He had no sooner landed upon the earth, but he moved for-
ward towards me, with along spear or weapon in his hand to
kill me; and when he came to a rising ground, at some dis-
tance, he spoke to me, or I heard a vorce so terrible that it is
impossible to express the terror of it: all that I can say I
understood, was this: " Seeing all these things have not
brought thee to repentance, now thou shalt die;" at which
[words I thought he lifted up the spear that was in his hand to
'1 me.

N 0 one that shall ever read this account, will expect that I
should be able to describe the horrors of my soul at this terrible
vision; I mean that even while it was a dream, I even dreamed
of those horrors; nor is it any more possible to describe the
impression that remained upon my mind, when I awaked, and
found it was but a dream.

I had, alas! no divine knowledge: what I had received by
the good instruction of my father, was then worn out, by an
uninterrupted series, for eight years, of seafaring wrckedness,
and a constant conversation with none but such as were, like
myself, wicked and profane to the last degree. Ido not re-
member that I had, in all that time, one thought that so much
as tended either to looking upward towards God, or inward
towards a reflection upon my own ways: but a certain stu-

ad entirely overwhelmed me,- and I was all that the most
hardened, unthinking, wicked creature, amon our common
sailors, can he an posed to be; not having least send,

, either of the fear a God, in danger, or of thankfulness to him,
in deliverances.

1n the relatingevlvhat is alreadtvspast of my story, this will be
the more easily ieved, when all add that irough all the
variety of miseries that had to this day befallen me I never
had so much as one thought of its being the hand oi" God, or
that it was ajust punishment for my sin; either my rebellious
behavior against my father, or my resent sins, which were
great; or even a unishment for t general course of my'
wicked lite. n was on the desperate expedition on the
desert shores of Africa, I never had so much as one thought
of what would become of me; or one wish to God to direct me
whither I should 0 or to keep me from the danger which ap-
parently surroun e me, as well from voracious creatures, as
cruel savages: but I was uite thoughtless of a God or a Prov-
idence; acted like a mere rute, from the principlesof nature,
and by the dictates of common sense only; and, indeed,
hardly that. When I was delivered and taken up at sea, by
the Portuguese captain, well used and dealt with justly and
honorably, as well as charitably, l'had not the least thankful-
ness in m thoughts. When, again, I was shipwrecked,
ruined, an in dangerpfdrowning, on this island I was as far
from remorse, or looking on it as a judgment: Ionly said to
myself often, that I was an unfortunate dog, and born to be
always <<miserable.

It is true, when I first got on shore here, and timed all in
ship's crew drowned, an myself spared, l was surprised In I
a kind of ecstasy, and some transports of soul, which, had the
grace of God assisted might have come up to true thankful-
ness; but it ended where it began, in a mere common t
of joy; or, as I may say, being glad I was alive, without

which had preserved me, and had singled me out tobepm
served when all the rest were destroyed, or an inquiry why
Providence had been thus merciful to me; just the same com'
mon sort of joy which seamen generally have, after they are
got safe ashore from a shipwreck - which they drown all in
the next bowl of punch, and forget almost as soon as it is over -
and all the rest of my life Was like it. Even when I was, af:
terwards, on due consideration, made sensible of in condition

---how I was cast on this dreadful place, out of t e reach of
human kind, out of all hope of relief, or prospect of redemp-
tion,--as soon as I saw but a prospect of living, and that I
should not starve and erish for hunger, all the sense of my
afiliction wore off, and fbegan to be very easy, applied mvsell'
to the works pro r for my preservation and supply, and was
far enough from 'ng afflicted at my condition, as a 'iidgment
from Heaven, or as the hand of God against me: t ese were
thoughts which very seldom entered into my head.

The growing up of the corn, as is hinted in my journal, had,
at first, some little influence upon me, and began to affect me
with seriousness, as long as I thought it had something mirac-
ulous in it; but as soon as that part of the thought was re'
moved, all the impression which was raised from it wore off
alsohas l have noted already. Even the earthquake, though
nothing could be more terrible in its nature, or more iinmer
diately directing to the invisible Power which alone directs
such thin 5, yet no sooner was the fri ht over, but the impres-
sion-it has made went of also. I ha no more sense of God,
or his judgments, much less of the present affliction of my cir-
cumstances being from his hand, than if I had been in the
most rosperous condition of life. But now, when I began to
be sic , and a leisure view of the miseries of death came to
place itself before me; when my spirits began to sink under
the burden of a stron distemper, and nature was exhausted
with the violence of t e fever; conscience, that had slept so
long, began to awake; and l reproached myself with my past
life, in w ich I had so evidently, by uncommon wickedness.
provoked the justice of God to lay me under uncommon strokes,
and to deal With me in so vmdictive a manner. These reflec-
tions op ressed me for the second or third day of my distem-
per; an in the violence, as well of the fever as of the dreadful
reproaches of m conscience extorted from me some words
like praying to 0d; though I cannot say it was a prayer at-
tended either with desires or with hfipes it was rather the
voice of mere fright and distress. y thoughts were con-
fused; the convictions great upon my mind; and the horror
of d mg in such a miserable condition raised vapors in my
hea With the mere apprehension; and in these hurries _of my
soul, I knew not what my ton ue might express; but it was
rather exclamation, such as, " rd w at a miserable creature
am I! If I should be sick, I shall certainly die for want of
help; and what will become of me?" Then the tears burst
out of my eyes, and I could say no more for a good while. In
this interval the good advice of my father came to my mind,
and presently his prediction, which I mentioned at the be 'no
ninfi of this story, viz. that if 1 did take this foolish step, od
woud not bless me; and I should have leisure hereafier to
reflect upon having neglected his counsel, when there might
be none to assist in my recovery. " Now " said I, aloud,
" my dear father's words are come to pass; eod's justice has
overtaken me, and I have none to help or hear me. I rejected
the vorce of Providence, which had mercifully put me in a sta-
tion of life wherein I might have been happy and easy; but I
would neither see it myself nor learn from my parents to know
the blessing of it. llett them to mourn over my folly; and
now I am left to mourn under the con uences of it: I refiised
their help and assistance, who would ave pushed me in the
world, and would have made every thing easy to me; and now
I have difficulties to struggle with, too great for even nature
itself to sup rt,- and no assistance, no comfort, no advice."
Then I on _ out, " Lord, be my help, for I am in great dis-
tress." This was the first grayer, if I may call it so,that I
had made a: many years. at I return to my journal. ,

June 28. I'Iavin been somewhat refreshed with the sleep I
had had, and the t being entirely off, I got up; and though
the fright and terror of my dream was very great, yet I con
sidere that the fit of the ague would return again the next
day, and now was In time to get something to refresh and
support myself when should be ill. The first thing I did was
to fill a large square case-bottle with water, and set it u n
my_table, in reach of my bed ' and to take off the c ' or
agmsh disposition of the water,I put about a uarter of a pint
o rum into it, and mixed them to ther. hen [got me a
piece of the goat's flesh, and broil it on the coals, but could
eat very little. I walked about; but was very weak, and withal
very sad and heavy-hearted undE; a sense of my miserable
condition, dreading the return of my disrem r the next day.
At night, I made my supper of three of t e turtle's eggs;
which I roasted in the ashes, and ate, as we-call it,in the sheil;
and this was the first bit of meat I had ever asked God's bless-
ing to, as I could remember, in my whole life. After I had
eaten, I tried to walk; but found myself so weak, that I could
hardly can the gun (for I never went out without that) ; .so I
went but aiittle way, and sat down u on the ground, locking
out upon the sea which was just beore me, and very calm
and smooth. As sat here, some such thoughts as these oc-
curred to me: " What is this earth and sea, of which I have
seen so much? VVhence is it produced? And what am I
and all the other creatures, wild and tame, human and brutal'i
Whence are we'! Surely, we are all made by some secret
Power, who formed the earth and sea, the air and sk . And
who is that?" Then it followed most naturally, " tis God

God has made all these things, he guides and overns them all
and all things that concern them; for the ower. that could
make all thin s, must certainly have power to guide. and di-
rect them: i so, nothing can happen in the great circuit of
his works, either without his know edge or appomtment.

" And if nothing happens without his know edge, he know-
that 1 am here, and am in this dreadful condition; and if
nothing ha pens without his appointment, he has appointed
all this to fall me." Nothing occurred to my thought, to
contradict any of these conclusions; and therefore it rested
u n me with the greatest force, that it must needs be that

the world. Immediately it followed, " hy as God one this
to me 2 What have I done to be thus used 1 " My conscience
presently checked me in that inquiry, as_il' I had lasphcmcd;
and methought it s he to like a vorce,--"Wretchl dost
thou ask what thou ligst'd Look back upon a dreadful
misspent life, and ask thyself what thou hast not done. Ask,
why is it that thou wert-not long ago destroyed? Why wert
than not drowned in Yarmouth Roads; killed in the fight
when the shi was taken by the Sallee man-of-war; devoured
by the wild asts on the coast of Africa' or drowned here.
when all the crew perished but thyself? 150st thou ask what
thou hast done 1 " I was struck dumb with these reflections,
as one astonished, and had not a word to say; no, not to an-
swer to myself; and rising up pensive and sad, walked back .
to my retreat, and went over my wall, as if I had been going
to bed; but my thoughts were sadly disturbed, and 1 had no
inclination tosleep; so I sat down in the chair, and lighted my .
lamp, for it began to be dark. Now, as the ap rehension of
the return of my distemper terrified me very muc , it occurred
tomy thought, that the Brazilians take no physio but their
tobacco for almost all distempers; and I had a piece of a roll
of tobacco in one of the chests, which was uite cured; and
some also that was green and not quite cu . _ . '

I went, directed y eaven no doubt; for in.this chest I
found a cure both for soul and body. I opened the chest, and
found what I looked-for, viz. 'the tobacco; and as the. few
books I had saved lay there too, I took out one of the Bibles

whichl mentioned berue, and whichto this time Iliad noc' .
found leisure, or so much as inclination to look into. lsay,
I took it out, and brought both that and the tobacco with me
to the table. What use to make of the tobacco I knew not, as
to my distemper, nor whether it was ood for it or not; but I
tried several experiments with it, as i I was resolved it should
hit one way or other. I first took a piece of a leaf, and chewed
it in my mouth; which, indeed, at first, almost stupefied my
brain; the tobacco being reen and strong, and suc as I had
not been much used to. ' hen I took some and stee it an
hour or two in some rum, and resolved to take a ose of it
when I lay down: and lastly,I burnt some n n a pan of
coals, and held my nose close or the smoke o it aslong as I
could bear it; as well for the h t, as almost for suffocation.
In the interval of this operation, I took up the Bible, andbe~
gan to read; but my head was too much disturbed with the
tobacco to bear readin , at least at that time; only, having
opened the book casual y, the first words that occurred to me
were these: " Call on me in the day of trouble, and I will de-
liver thee, and thou shalt glorify me." These words were very
apt to my case, and made some im ression upon my thoughts
at the time of reading them, thong not so much as they did
afterwards; for, as for bem delivered, the word had no sound,
as I may say, to me; the t ing was so remote so impossible
in my apprehension of things, that, as the ch' dren of Israel
said when they were promised flesh toeat, " Can God spread a
table in the wilderness? " so I began to say, " Gan even God
himself deliver me from this place?" Andas it was not for
many years that any hopes aplpceared, this prevailed very
often upon my droughts: but wever, the words made a

rent impression upon me, and I mused upon them very ofien.

t now grew late; and the tobacco had, as I said dazed my
head so much, that I inclined to sleep: so _I leli my [amp
burning in the cave, lest I should want any thing In the night,
and went to bed. But before I Say down, I d: what I never
had done in all my life; I kneel down, and .rayed toGod
to fulfil the promise to me, that if I called upon In the day

of trouble, he would deliver me. After rn broken and imperfect
prayer was over, I drank the rum in w 'ch I had steeped the
trbacco- which was so strong and rank of the tobacco, the
indeed, I could scarce get it down: immedtately upon this
went to bed. 1 found presently the rum flew up Into my head
violently; but! fell into a sound sleep, and waked no more,
till, by the sun, it must necessaril be near three o'clock in the
efiernoop the next day: nay, to ' hour I am partly ofopin-
run, that I slept all the next day and night, and till almost
three the day afier; for otherwise, I know not how I should
lose a Se? out of my reckonin in the duty: of the week, as it
appea , some years after, I ad done; r if I had lost it by
crossing and recrossing the Line, I should have lost more than
one day; but certainly I lost a day in my account, and never
knew which way. Be that. however, one we or the other,
when I awaited. I found myself exceedingly re eshed, and my
spirits lively and cheerful: when I ot up, I was stron r than
I was the day before, and m stomac better, for l was angry;
and, in short, I had no fit e next day but continued much

with m gun, but did not care to travel too far. I killed s
sen-fow or two, something like a brand goon andbrought
them home; but was not very forward to eat them; so I ate
some more of the turtle's e gs, which were very good. This
evening I renewed the the lane, which I had supposed did
me end the day before viz. the tobacco stee in run; only
1 di% not take so much as before, nor did chew any of the

recover my full strength for some weeks after. While I was
thus gathering strennth, my thoughts ran exceedingly upon
this scripture, " l willdelivcr thee; " and the impossibility of
my deliverance lay much upon my mind, in bar of my ever
expecting it: but as l was discouraging myself with such
thotgghts, it occurred to my mind that l pored so much upon
my eliverance from the main-alliiction, that l disregarded the
deliverance I had received; and>> I was, as it were, made to ask
myself such questions as these, viz. " Have 1 not been de-
iivered, and wonderfully too from sickness; from the most:
distressed condition that could be, and that was so fri htful to
me! and what notice have 1 taken of it? Have I one my
hart? God has delivered me, but 1 have not glorified him;
that is to say, I have not owned and been thankful for that as
a deliverance; and how can 1 expect a - eater deliverance? "
This touched my heart very much; an immediately 1 knelt
zlotlvn, and gave God thanks aloud fonmy recovery from my
MC ness.

July 4. In the morning I took the Bible; and beginning at
the New Testament, I be an seriously to read it; and-- imposed
upon myself to read aw ile every morning and every night;
not binding myself to the number of chapters, but as iontIr as
my thoughts should engage me. It was not long after fsea
seriously to this work, that I found my heart more deeply-
1nd sincerely affected with the wickedness of my past Info.
The impression of my dream revived; and the words, " Alt
these things have not brought thee to repentance," ran seri~
wsly in my thoughts. I was earnestly begging of God to give
me re entance, when it happened provnlentially, the very
:=ame ay, that reading the Scripture, I came to-these words,
" He is exalted a prince and a Savior; to give repentance,
and togive remission." f threw down the book : and, with my
heart as well as my hands lifted up to heaven, in a kind of
ecstasy of joy, I cried out aloud, " Jesus, thou Son of David:
Jesus, thou exalted Prince and Savior! give me repent ince!'
This was the first time in all. my lit}: 1 umklsayfin the mun-
sense of the words, that I prayed; for now I prayed with a

sense of my condition, and with a true Scri ture view of hope,

founded on the encouragement of the war of God; and from

hhis time, I may say, I began to have hope that God would
ear me. ,

Now I be an to construe the words mentioned above, " Call
on me, and will deliver thee," in a ditferent sense from what
I had ever done before; for then I had no notion of an thing
being called deliverance, but my being delivered from t cap-
tivity I was in; for though I was indeed at large in the place,
yet the island was certainly a prison to me, and that in the
worst sense iii the world. But now I learned to take it in
another sense; now I looked back upon my past life with such
horror, and m sins a peared so dreadful, that my soul sought
iiothinagI of but de iverance from the load of guilt that bore
down I my comfort. As for my solitary life, it was nothing:
I did not so much as pray to be delivered from it, or think of
it; it was all of no consideration, in comparison with this.
And I add this part here, to hint to whoever_shall read it
that whenever they come to a true sense of things, they will
find deliverance. from sin a much greater blessrng than deliv-
erancelfrom allliction. But leaving this part, I return tomy
Joiiriia .

My condition. began now to be, though not less miserable as
to my wav of living, yet much easier to my mind: and my
thoughts being directed, by constantly reading the Scripture
and praying to God, tothings of a higher nature, I had 'a great
deal of comfort Within, which, till now, I knew nothing of;
also, as my health and strength returned, I bestirred me to
furnish myself with every thing that I wanted, and make my
we of livmg as regular as I could.

rom the 4th of uly to the 14th, I was chiefly employed in
walking about With my gun in my hand, a little and a little at
a time, as a man that was ether-mg up his strength alter a fit
of sicknqs; for it is h y to be iina 'ned how low I was,
and to what weakness I was reduced. he apphcation which

I made use of was perfectly new. and perhaps what had..never
cured an ague before; neither can 'I recommend It to any one
to practise, by this experiment; and though it did can 0!?
the fit, yet it rather contributed to weakening me; for had
frequent convulsions in my nerves and limbs tor some time :.I
learned from it, also, this, in particular; that being abroad in
the rain season, was the most pernicious thing to my health
that could be, especially in those rains which came attended
with storms and hurricanes of wind; for as the rain which
came in the dry season was almost always accompanied with
such storms, so I found that this rain was much more danger-
ous than the rain which fell in September and Qctober.

I had now been in this unhappy island above ten months;
all possibility of deliverance from this condition seemed to be
entirel taken from me; and I firmly believed that no human
shape _ad ever set foot u n that place. Having secured my
habitation, as I thought, ully to,my mind,I had a great desrre
to make a more perfect discovery of the island and to see
what other productions I might find, which I yet knew
nothing of.

It was on the 15th of July that I began to take a more ar-
ticular survey of the island itself. I went up the creek rst,
where, as l hinted, I brought my rafts on shore. I found, after
I came about two miles up, that the tide did not flow any
higher; and that it was no more than a little brook of running
water, verfi fresh and good: but this being the dry season,
there was ardly any water in some parts of it; at east not
any stream. On the banks of this brook I found many eas-
ant savannahs or meadows, plain smooth, and cover with
grass; and on the rismg parts of them, next to the higher

rounds {where the water, as it might be supposed, never over-
fiowed), found a great deal of tobacco, green, and growin to
a very great and stron stalk; and there were divers o ier
plants, which I had no nowledge of, or understanding about
and that might, perhaps, have virtues of their own, which I
could not fin out. I searched for the cassava root, which the
Indiana,- in all that climate, make their bread of" but 1
could find none. I saw large plants of aloes, but did, not un-
uerstand them. I saw several sugar-canes, but wild; and for
want of cultivation, imperfect. l contented myself with these
discoveries for this time; and came back, musin with myself
what course I might take to know the virtue an goodness of
any of the fruits or lants which I should discover; but could
bring it to no cone usion; for in short, I had made so httle
observation while I was in the lirazlls, that I knew httle of the
plants in the field; at least, very little that might serve me to
any. purpose now in my distress. .

be next day, the 16th, I went u the same way again; and
afier going something farther than had gone the day before,
I lbund the brook and the savannahs begin to cease, and the
countr become more woody than before. In this part I
found it'ferent fruits; midparticularly I lbund melons upon
the ground, in at ahu ance, and grapes upon thetrees:
the vines, ind , had spread over the trees, and the clusters
of grapes were now just in their prime, very ripennd rich.
This was a surprising discovery, and l was exceedingly glad
of them, but I was warned by my experience to eat sfimngly
of them; rememberin that when I was ashore [in arbor ,

At the end of this march 1 came to an oscning where the
country seemed to descend to the west; an a little spring of
fresh water, which issued out of the side of the hill by me, ran
the other way, that is, due east; and the country appeared so
fresh, so green, so flourishing, every thing beinty in a constant
verdure, or flourish of spring, that it looked .Iike a planted
garden. I. descended a little on the side of that delicious vale,
surveyi% it with a secret kind of leasure (though mixed with
other a icting thoutrhts), to thin that this was all in own'
that I was kin and Toni of all this country indefensib y, and
had a right 0 possession; and, if I could convey it, I might
have it in inheritance as completely as any lord of a manor in
England. I saw here abundance of cocoa-trees, and orange,
lemon, and citron-trees, but all wild, and very few bearin any
fruit; at least, not then. However, the green limes t at I
gathered were not only pleasant to eat, but very wholesome;
and 1 mixed their Juice afterwards with water, which made it
very wholesome, and very cool and refreshing. I found now I
had business enough to gather and carry home; and I resolved
to lay up a store, as wel of grapes as limes and lemons, to_fur-
nisli myself for the wet season, which I knew was approaching.
In order to this, I gathered a great heap of grapes in one place
a lesser heap in another place, and a great parcel of limes an
melons in another (place; and, taking a few of each with me, I
travelled homewar ; and resolved to come again, and bring a
bag or sack, or what I could make, to carry the rest home.
Aocordin ly, having spent three days in this journey, I came
home (so? must now call my tent and my-cave) ; but before I
got thither, the gra s were 3 iled; the richness of_ the fruits,
and the weight of t e juice, aving broken and bruised them,
they were ood for little or nothing: as to the limes, they were
good, but lgcould bring only a few. . _

The next day, being the 19th, I went back, havmg made me
two small bags to bring home my harvest ;_ but I was surprised
when, coming to my heap of rapes, which were so rich an
fine when I gathered them, found them all spread about,I

trod to pieces, and dragged about, some here, some there, and
abundance eaten and devoured. By this I concluded there
were some wild creatures thereabouts which had done this, but
what they were I knew not. However, as 1 found there was
no laying them up in heaps, and no carrying them away in a
sack,- but that one way they would be destroyed, and the
other way they would be crushed with their own weight; I took
another course : I then gathered a large a'uantity of the gaps,
and hung them upon the out-branches o the trees, that y
might cure and dry in the sun; and as for the limes and lemons
I carried as man back as I could well stand under.

When I came ome from this journey I contemplated with
great leasure the fruitfulness of that valley, and the le'asant-
ness the situation; the security from storms on t at side'
the water and the wood; and concluded that I had pttched
upon a place to fix m abode in, which was by far the worst
part f t country. pan the whole, I began to consider of
removing my habitation, and to look out for a place equally
safe as where I was now situate; if possible, in that pleasant,
fruitful part of the island.

This thoughtran lon in my head; and I was exceeding
fond of it for some time, t e pleasantness of the place tern ting
me; but when I came to a nearer view of it, I conside that
l was now by the sea-side, where it was at least sible that
something might happen to my advantage, and, y the same
III fate that brought me hither, might bring some other un-
happy wretches to the same place; and though it was scarce
probable that any such thing 'should ever happen, yet to en-
close myself among the hills and woods in the centre of the
island, was to antic! ate my bondage, and to render such an
affair not only impro able, but impossrble; and that, therefore,
I ought not by any means to remove. However, I was so en-
amored of this place, that I spent much of 1:? ttme there lbr
the whole remaining part of the month of J y; d though,
upon second thong ts, I resolved, as above stated,"1lot taco-
move, yet I built me a little kind of a bower, and surrounded

it at a distance with a strong fiance, being a double hedge, as
high as I could reach,_well staked, and filled between with
brushwood. Here I lay very secure, sometimes two or three
nights t4?ether; always going over it with a ladder, as before;
so that fancied now I had my country and m sea-coast
house. This work took me up till the be inning 0 August.

I had but newly-finished my fence, an began to enJoy my
labor when the rains came on, and made me stick close to my
first abitation; for though I had made a tent, like the other,
With a piece of sail, and spread it very well, yet I had not the
shelter of a hill to keep me from storms, nor a cave behind me
to retreat into when. the rains were extraordinary.

About the beginning of August, as I said, I had finished my
bower, and be an toenjoy myself. The 3d of August I found
the grapes I ad hung up were perfectly dried, an indeed
were excellent good raisins of the sun: so I began to take
them down from the trees; and it was very happy that I did
so, as the rains which followed would have'spoiled them, and I
should have lost the best part of m winter food; for I had
above two hundred large bunches 0 them. No sooner had I
taken them all down, and carried most of them home to my
cave, but it began to rain; and from hence, which was the
14th of August, it rained, more or less, every day till the mid-
dle of October; and sometimes so violently, that I could not
stir out of my cave for several days.

In this season, I was much surprised with the increase of
my family. I had been concerned for the loss of one of my
cats, who ran away from me,_or, as I thought, had been dead;
and [heard no more of her, till, to my astonishment, she came
home with three kittens. This was the more stran to me
because about the end of August, thou h I had_k ed a wild
cat as I called it, with my gun, yet I t ought it was quite a
different kind from our European cats: yet the youn cats
were the same kind of house breed asthe old one; an both
of my cats bein. females, I thought it very strange. But
from these three, afierwards came to be so pestered WIth cats,sonmsou crime. 111

that I was forced to kill them like vermin or wild beasts, and
to drive them from my ,house as much as possible.

From the 14th .of August to the 23th, incessant rain; so
that I could not stir, and was now very careful not to be much
wet. In this confinement I an to be straitened for food ;
but venturing out twice, I one ay killed a goat, and the last
day, which was the 26th, found a very large tortoise, which
was a treat to me. My food was now regulated thus: I ate a
bunch of raisins for my breakfast; a piece of the goat's flesh,
ofll'the turtle;br01led, for my dinner (for, to in great misfor-
t nghad no vessel to bail or stew any thing , and two or
g of the turtlefs eggs for my supper.

During this confinement in my cover by the rain I worked
dail two or three hours atenla 'ng my cave and by degrees
wor ed it on towards one side, ' I came to the outside of the
hill, and made a door or way out, which. came beyond my
fence or wall; and so l'came in and out this wa . But I was

yet seen upon the i and being a goat. .
{September 30. I was now come to the unhappy anniversary
of}?! landing. I cast up the notches on my post, and found
I h been on shore three hundred and sixty-live days. I kept
this day as a solemn fast, setting it apart for religious exercise,
prostr'sting myself on the ground with the most serious humil-
iation,'confessiiig my sins to God, acknowledging his righteous
judgments upon me, and graying to him to have mercy on me,

had been there a year; so I ivided it into weeks, and set
apart every seventh day for a Sabbath; though I found, at the
end of my account, I had lost a day or two in my reckoning.
A little after this, my ink in ' to fail me,I contented
myself to use it more sparing lil'e to write down only the
most remarkable events of my ' , without continuing a daily
memorandum of other things.

The rainy season and the dry season began now to a pear
regular to me, and I learned todivide them so as to provi e for
them accordingly' but I bought all my experience before I
had it; and what am going to relate was one of the most
discouraging experiments that I had made at all.

I have mentioned that I had saved the fiawears of barley
and rice which I had so surprisinglv found sprung up as I
thought, of themselves. I believe there were about thirty
stalks of rice, and about twenty of barley; and now I thought -
it a proper time to sow it after the rains',the sun being in its
sout ern ition going from me. Accordingly, I-duga piece
of roun , as well as I could, with my woodens ade; and, di-
i'ri mg it into two parts, I sowed my grain' got, as I was
sowing, it casuall occurred _to my thoughts at I would not
sow it all at first, ause I did not know when was the lgroper
time for it; 301 sowed about 'two thirds of the seed, avin
about a handful of each; and it was a great combrt to me a.
terwards that I did so, for not one gram of what I sowed this
time came to any thing; for the dry month Mowing, and the
earth having thus had no rain after the seed was sown, it had.
no moisture to assist its growth, and never.came up at all til .

sprung up very pleasantly, and yielded a very good crop; but
having only art of the seed left, and not daring to sow all that
I had, I got at a small quantity at last, my whole crop not
amountin to above hall's peek of each kind. But by this ex-
perimentfi was made master of my business, and knew exactly
when was the pro r time to sow; and that I might expect
two seed-times an two harvests every year. .

While this corn was growin , I made a little discovery,
which was of use to me alterwur s. As soon as the rains were
over, and the weather began to settle, which was about the
month of November, I made a visit up the country to my
bower; where, though I had not been some .months, yet 1
lbund all things just as 1 left them. The circle or double
hedge that 1 had made was not only firm and entire, but the
stakes which 1 had cut out of some trees that grew thereabouts
were all shot out, and grown with long branches, as much as a
willow-tree usuall shoots the first 'ear after lopping its head;
but 1 could not tel what tree to c it that these stakes were
cut from. I was surprised, and yet very well pleased, to see
the young trees. grow; and I pruned them, and led them to
flow as much alike as I could; and it is scarce credible how

autiful a figure they grew into in three years; so that,
though the hedge made a circle of about twenty-five yards in
diameter, yet the trees--for such 1 mi ht now call them--soon
covered it; and it was a complete s iade, sufficient to lodge
under all the dry season; This made me resolve to cut some
more stakes, and make me a hedge like this, in a semicircle
round my wall (I mean that of my first dwelling), which 1 did;
and placing the trees or stakes in a double row, at about eight
.yads' distance from my first fence, they grew presently, and

.1. bund now that the seasons of the year mi ht generally be
dmded, not into summer and winter, as in urope, hut into
the rainy season and the dry seasons, which were generally
thus: From the middle of February to the middle of April,
rainy; the sun being then on or near the equinox. .Frorn the
middle of April till the middle of August, dry ; the sun being
then north of the line. From the middle of August till the
middle of October, rainy; the sun being then come back to
the line. From the middle ol'October till the middle ot'Feb-
ruary, dry; the sun bein r then to the south of the hue. .
The rainy seasons hed sometimes longer and sometimes
shorter, as the winds happened to blow; but this was the gen-
eral observation: 1 made. After I had found, by experience,
the ill consequences of being abroad in the rain, 1 took care
to furnish myself with provisions beforehand, that I might not
be obliged to <<0 out; and I sat within doors as much as pos-
sible during t ,0 wet months. In this time 1 found much etn~
ployment, and very suitable also to the time; for I found great
occasion for many thin s which 1 had no wav to furnish my
self with, but by hard la wr and constant a plication: artic>>
ularly, I tried many ways to make myselF a basket; at all
the twigs! could get for the pur ose proved so brittle; that
they would do nothing. It rove of excellent advanta e to
me now, that when l was a ov, I used to take great de ight
in standing at a basket-maker's in the town where my
father live , to see them make their wicker-ware; and
being, as boys usually are, very officious to help, and a
great observer of the manner how they worked those thin s
and sometimes lending a hand, 1 had by these means (ill
knowledge of the methods oftt, so that I wanted nothing but
the materials; when it came into my mind, that the twigs of
that_tree from whence I cut my stakes that grew, might
posstbly be as tough as the sallows, willows, and osiers,
In England; and l resolved to try. Accordingly, the next
day, I went to my country-house, as I called it; and, cutting
some of the smaller twigs, ! found them to my purpose as
much as} could desire; whereupon I came the next time pre-
ared thh a hatchet, to cut down a quantit , which lsoun
ed, for there was great plenty of them. '1' ese 1 set up to
dry within my circle or hedge; and when they were fit fa
use, I carried them to my cave; and here, during the next
season, I employed myself in making, as well as I could, sev-
eral, baskets, both to carry earth, or to carry or lay up any
thing, as I had occasion for. Though I did not finish them
very handsomely, yet I made them sufficiently serviceable for
my purpose; and thus, afterwards, I took care never to be
without them; and as m wicker~ware decayed, I made more;
,e necially stron , dec askets, to place my cum in, instead
o?sacks, when shou (I come to have any quantit ' of it.
Having mastered this difficulty, and emplo' a world of
time about it, I bestirred myself to see, if ossi le, how to sup-
ply two other wants. I had no vessel to old any thin that
was-liquid, except two runlets, which were almost full 0 rum,
and some glass bottles, some of the common size, and others
{which were case-bottles) square, for the hdceigf of waters,
spirits, doc. I had not so much as a pot to ' any thing;
except a great kettle, which I saved out of the ship, and-which
was too big for such use as I desired it, viz. to make broth,
and stew a it of meat by itself. The second thing I would thin
have had was a tobacco i ; but it was impossible for me
to make one: however, ound a contrivance for that too at
last. I employed myself in planting my second row of stakes
.or piles, and also in this wicker-working, all the summer or
dry season; when another business took me up more time than
it could be im ined I could spare.
. I mentioned fore, that I had a great mind tosee the whole
tsland; and that I had travelled up the brook, and so on to
where I had built m bower, and where I had an openin quite
to the sea, on the ot er side of the island. I now ved to
travel me across to the sea-shore, on that side; so, taking my
gun, a awhet, and my dog, and a larger quantity of powder
and shot than usual, With two biscuit-cakes, and a great bunch
of raisins in my pouch, for my store, I began my journey
When I had passed the vale where my bower stood, as above,
I came withinuewofthe sea, tothe west; and it being aver)
clear day, I fairly descried land, whether an island cementi-
nent I could not tell ; but it lay very high, extending from W.
to W S.W., at a very great distance; by my guess, it could
not be less than fifteen or twenty leagues off.

I could not tell what part of the world this might be; other ,
wise than that I knew it must be part of America, and, as l .
concluded, by all m observations, must be near the Spanish
dominions, and per laps was all inhabited by savages, where '
if I should have landed, I had been in a worse cqndition thanl
was now. I therefore acquiesced in the dispositions of Provi-
dence, which I began now to own and to believe ordered every
thing for the best; I say, I quieted' my mind with this, and
left 03' afflicting myself with fruitless wishes of being there.

Besides, after some pause upon this affair, I cons1dered that
if this land was the Spanish coast, I should certainly, one time
or other, see some vessel pass or regeass one way or othef; but
if not, then it was the savage coast tween the Spanish couno
try and the Brazils, whose inhabitants are indeed the worst of
sava s; for they are cannibals, or men-eaters, and fall not to
. mur er and devour all human beings that fall into their hands.

With these considerations, walking very leisurely forward,l
found this side of the island, where I now was, much pleasant-
er than mine; the open or savannah fields sweet! adorned
with flowers and grass, and full of very fine w s. I saw
abundance of parrots, and fain would have caught one if
possible to have kept it to be tame, and taught it to spe to
me. I did, afier taking some pains, catch a young parrot; for
I knocked it down With a stick, and, having recovered it 1
brought it home; but it was some years before I could ma e
him speak: however, at last I taught him to call me by my
name very familiarly. But the accident that followedfithoug

But I had no need to be venturous; for I had no want of
food, and of that which was very good too; especially these
three sorts, viz. goats, pigeons, and turtle, or tortorse. With
these, added to my grapes, Leaden-hall-Market could not have
furnished a table better than I, in roportion to the company; .
and though my case was deplorabIe enough, yet I had great
cause for than fulness; as I was not driven to any extremities
for food, but had rather plenty, even to dainties.

I never travelled on this journey above two miles outright in
a day, or thereabouts; but I took so many turns and returns,
to see what discoveries I could make, that I came weary
enou h to the place where I resolved to sit down for the night;
and t en I either re d myself in a tree, or surrounded my-
self with a row of st es, set upright in the ground, either from
one tree to another, or so as no wild creature could come at
me Without waking me.

As soon as I came to the sea-shore, I was surprised to see
that I had taken up my lot on the worst side of the island; for
here indeed the shore was covered with innumerable turtles;
whereas, on the other side, I had found but three in a year and -
a half. Here was also an infinite number of fowls of many
kinds; some of which I had seen, and some of which I had not
seen before, and many of them very good meat; but such as I
knew not the names of, except those called nguins.

I could have shot as many as I leased, ut was very spar-
in of my powder and shot; and erefore had more mind to
kill a she-goat, if I could, which I could better feed on. But
thou h there were many goats here more than on my side the
islan , yet it was with much more difficulty that I could come
near them; the country being flat and even, and they saw me
much sooner than when I was upon a hill.

I confess this side of the country was much pleasanter than
mine; yet I had not the least inclination to remove; for as l
was fixed in my habitation, it became natural to me. and I
seemed all the while I was here to be as it were upon a journey,
and frai'fl home. However, I travelled along the sea-shore'5.

towards the east, I suppose about twelve milefind th *setv
ting up a at pole upon the shore for a mark, I concl I
would a ome again; and that the next journey I took should
be on e other srde of the island, east from m dwelling, and
so round till I came to my post again; of whic in its lace.

I took another way to come back than that Iwent, inkin
I could easily keep so much of the island in my view, that
could not miss my first dwelling by viewing the country; but
I found myself mistaken; for being come about two or three
miles, I found myself descended into a very large valley, but
so surrounded with hills, and those hills covered with wood,
that I could not see which was my way, by any direction but-that
of the sun, nor even then, unless I knew very well titration
of the sun at that time of the day. And it happe to my
further misfortune, that the weather proved hazy for three or
four days while I was in this valley; and not bein able to see
the sun, I wandered about very uncomfortable, an at last was
obliged to find out the sea-side, look ibr my post, and come
bac the same way I went; and then by easy journe s I
turned homeward, the weather being exceeding hot, an my
gun, ammunition, hatchet, and other things, very heav .

In this journey, my dog sur rised a young kid, an seized
_upon it; and running to take old of it, I caught it, and saved
It alive from the d r. I had a great mind to bring it home if I
could; for I had 0 en been musing whether it might not be
possrble to get a kid or two, and so raise a breed-of tame oats,
which might su ply me when my powder and shot 5 d be
all spent. I m e a collar for this little creature, and with a
string which I had made of some rope-yarn which I always
carried about me, I led him along, the <<h with some difficulty
till I came to my bower, and there inclosed him and lefi
him; for I was very impatient to be at home, from whence I
had been absent above a month. '

been so unpleasant to me that my own house, as I called it to
myself, was a perfect settlement to me, compared to that; and
it rendered every thing about me so comfortable, that I re-
solved I would never go a rent way from it again, while it
should be my lot to stay on the island.

I reposed myself here a week, to rest and regale myself alter
my long journey; during which, most of the time was taken
up in the weighty afi'air of making a c e for my Pol who
began now to be more domestic, and to mighty well ac.
quainted with me. Then I began to think of the poor kid
which I had penned within my little circle, and resolved to
fetch it home, or give it some food: accordingly I went, and
found it where I left it (for indeed it could not get out),
but was almost starved for want of food. I went and cut
boughs of trees, and branches of such shrubs as I could find,
and threw it over, and having fed it, I tied it as I did before
to lead it away; but it was so tame with beinnr hungry, that
had no need to have tied it, for it followed meelike a dog; and
as I continually fed it, the creature became so loving, so gentle,~
and so fond, that it was from that time one of my domestics
also, and would never leave me afterwards. ,

The rainy season of the autumnal equinox was now come,
and I kept the 30th of September, in the same solemn manner
as before, being the anniversary of my landing on the island;
having now been there two years, and no more prospect of
being delivered than the first da [came there. [spent the
whole day in humble and thank ul acknowledgments for the
many wonderful mercies which my solitary condition was at'
tended with, and without which it might have been infinitely
more miserable. I ave humble and hearty thanks to God for
having been pleased to discover to me, that it was possible I
might be more happy even in this solitary condition, than]
should have been in the enjoyment of society, and in all the
oleasures of the world; that he could fully make up to me the
deficiencies of my solitary state, and the want of human so-
ciety, by his presence, and the communications of his gracenonixsox eitusoic. 121

to my soul; supportimr, comforting, and encouraging me to
depend u )0" his provi ence here, and to hope for his eternal
presence ,berealier.

It was now that l bewan sensibly to feel how much more
happy the lifel now led was, with all its miserable circum-
stances, than the wicked, cursed, abominable life I led all the
past part of my days; and nowl changed both my sorrows
and my joys: my very desires altered; my atleetions changed
their gusts; and my delights Were perfectly new from what
they were at my first coming, or indeed tor the two years past.

Before, as I walked about, either on my hunting, or for
viewin r the country, the anguish of my soul at my condition
would 'ln'e'tk out upon me on a sudden, and my very heart
would die within me, to think of the woods, the mountains, the
deserts I was in; and how I was a prisoner, locked up with
the eternal bars and bolts of the ocean, in an uninhabited wil~
derness, without redemption. In the midst of the greatest
composures of my mind, this Would break out upon me like a
storm, and make me wring); my hands, and weep like a child:
sometimes it would take me in the middle of my work, and I
would immediately sit down and sigh, and look upon the
ground for an hour or two together: this was still worse to
me; but ifl could burst into tears, or give vent to my feelings
by words, it would go elf; and my grief, being exhausted,
would abate.

But now I began to exercise myself with new thoughts; I
daily read the word of God, and applied all the comforts of it
to my present state. One morning, being very sad, I opened
the Bible n )0" these words~--" I will never leave thee, nor for--
sake thee :' immediately it occurred that these words were to
me; why else should they be directed in such a manner. just
at the moment when I was monrningr over my e0ndition, as
one forsaken of God and man ? " will, then," said I, " if God
does not forsake me,of what ill consequence can it he, or what

matters it, thougfi the world should forsake me; seeing, on the
other hand, if I had all the world, and should lose the (am! and
blessing of God, there would be no com arisen in the loss? "

From this moment I began to concl e in my mind, that it
was possible for me to be more ha py in this forsaken, solitary
condition, than it was probable I s ould ever have been In any
other particular state in the world; and. with this thou lit]
was gouig to ive thanks to God for bringing me to this p ace.
I know not w at it was, but something shocked in mind at
that thought, and I durst not 5 ak the words. " ow canst
thou be such a hypocrite," sai I, even audibly, " to pretend
to be thankful for a condition, which, however thou mayest
endeavor to be contented with, thou wouldest rather prav
heartilyv to be delivered from ? " Here I stopped; but thomrli
I coul not say I thanked God for being here, yet I sincere y
gave thanks to God for opening my eyes, by whatever afllict-
ing providences, to see the former condition of my life, and to'
mourn for my wickedness, and repent. Inever opened the
Bible, or shut it, but my very soul within me blessed God for
directing my friend in England, without any order of mine, to
pack it up amoii my goods; and for assisting me afterwards
to save it out of t e wreck of the ship.

Thus, and in this disposition of mind, I l an my third
year; and though I have not given the reader t e trouble of
so particular an account of my works this year as the first,
get in general it may be observed, that I was'very seldom idle ;

at having regularly divided my time, accordin to the several
daily em )loyinents that were before me; suc as, first, My
duty to od, and the readin the Scriptures, which 1 con-
standy set a art some time or, thrice every day; secondly,
Going abroa with my gun for food, which generally took me
up three hours'every morning, whenit did not rain; thirdly
Ordering, curing, serving, and- cooking what Had killed
or catched for "'s'upply; these took' 11p great fut of the
day: also it is to considered, that in the middle of 152 day,
when the sun was in the zenith; the violence of the .heat was
too great to stir out; so that about four hours in the evening
was all the time I could he supposed to work in; with this ex'
ception, that sometimes I chan rod my hours of liuntintr and
working, and wont to work in lilo morning, and abroad with
my gun in the afternoon.

To this short time allowed for labor, I desire may he addel
the exceeding lalioriousmss of my work; the many lmtlrs
which .for want of tools, want ol'holp, and want ol'skill, s-urr
thingl did took up out of my limo; tiir oxamplv, l WIS full
two-and-forty days making,y mo 21 hoard fiir a long shell, which
I wanted in my cum; whurms, two sawyors, with tlu-ir tool:
and a saw-pit, Would have out six ol'thom out ol'tho samo trc-o
in half a day.

My case was this: it was a large tron which was to he cut
down, because my board was to he a broad one. This two I
was three days cuttingr down, and two mmo in cutting: otl' tho
houghs, and reducing it to a log, or pin 70 ol'timl'mr. 'Villl in-
oxpressiblo hacking and howiug, 1 reduced both the sides ot'it
into chips, till it was light enough to mom; then l turned it
and mat e one side of it smooth and flat as a board, from nml
to end; then, turning that side downward, cut tho otlwr sidm
tilll brought the ilziuk to be about three inchos thick, and
smooth on both si es. Any one may judge the labor of my
hands in such a piece of Work ; but lahor aiul patience carried
inc through that, and many other things: I only observe this
in particular, to show the reason why so much of my timo
went away with so little work, viz. that what might be a little
tCt be done with help and tools, was a vast labor, and require-l
a prodigious tune to do alone, and by hand. Notwithstanding;

having last one whole crop by sowin in the dry season: but
now my crop promised very well ; w en, on a sudden, I found
I wtts in danger of losing it all again by enemies of several
sorts, which It was scarce possible to kee from it; as, first,
the goats and wild creatures which I called hares, who, tasting
the sweetness of the blade, lay in it night and day, as soon as
it came up, and ate it so close, that It could get no time to
shoot up into stalk. '

I saw no remedy for this, but by makin an enclosure about
it with a hedge, which I did with a rent gem] of toil; and the
more, because it required speed. owever as my arable land
was but small, suited to my crop,I got it tolerably well fenced
in about three weeks' time; and shooting some of the creatures
. in the day time, I set my dog to guard it In the niwht, tying him
up to a stake at the gate, where he would stanzf and bark all
night long; so in a little time the enemies forsook the place,
and the corn grew very strong and well, and began to ripen
a mce.

1But as the. beasts ruined me before, while my corn was in
the blade, so the birds were as likely to ruin me now, when it-
was in the ear; for oing along by the place to see how it
throve, I saw my litte crop surrounded with fowls, I know
not 01' how many sorts, who stood, as it were, watchin till 1
should be gone. I immediate] let fly among them ( or I al-
ways had my un with me) ; I ad no sooner shot, but there
rose up a lit e cloud of fowls, which I had not seen at all,
from among the corn itself.

This touched me sensibly, for I foresaw that in a few days
they would devour all my hopes; that I should be starved, and
never be able to raise a crop at all; and what to do I could not
tell: however I resolved not to lose my corn, if possible
though I should watch it night and day. In the first place, I
went amon it, to see what damage was already done, and
found they ad spoiled a good deal of it; but that, as it was
yet too n for them, the loss was not so great but that the
remain er was likely to be a good crop, if It could be saved.Kl n lxsox t'uljsulfh 1-35

I staid by it to load my gun, and then coming awa_v,I could
easily see the thieves sitting upon all the trees about me, as If
they only waited till l was "gone away; and the event proved
it to be so; for as I walked oil, as il'goneJ was no sooner out of

his was what Iwished for; so I took them it i, and served

hem as we serve notorious thieves in I'lngland, viz. hanged
them in chains, for a terror to others. It is impossible to im-
agine that this should have such an effect as It had; for the
fowls not only never came to the corn, but, in short, they lor-
sook all that part of the island, and I could never see a bird
near the place as long as my scarecrou's hung there. This I,
was very lad of, you may be sure; and about the latter end
of Decem )er. which was our second harvest of the year,l
reaped my com.

I was sadly put to it for a scythe or Sickle to cut it down;
and all I could dolwas to make one as well as I could, out of
one of the broad-Swords, or cutlasses, which I saved among the
arms out of the shi . l'Iowevcr, as my first cro ) was but small,
I had no reat difil'iculty to cut it down: in s tort, I reaped it
my way, or I cut nothin oil'hut the ears, and carried it away
in a great basket which lghad made, and so rubbed it out with
my hands; and at the end of all my harvesting, I lound tint
out of my half peek of seed I had near two bushels of rice, and
above two bushels and a half of barley; that is to say, by my
guess, for I had no measure.

However, this was great encouragement to me; and l fore-
saw that, In time, it would please God to sup nly me with
bread; and yet here I was perplexed again; [lor l neither
knew how to grind, or make meal of my corn, or indeed how
to clean it an part it; nor, if made into meal, how to make
bread ofit: and ifhow to make it, yet I knew not how to bake

, u

antity for store, an to secure a constant supply, 1 reso ved
not to taste any of this cro , but to preserve it all for seed
against the next season; an , in the mean time, to employ all
my study and hours of working to accomplish this great work
of provi in" myself with corn and bread.

t mightlie truly said, that now I worked for my bread" It
is a little wonderful, and whatl believe few people have thought
much upon, viz. the strange multitude of little things necessary
in the providing, producing, curing, dressing, making, and
finishing this one article of bread. '

I, that was reduced to a mere state of nature, found this to
my daily discouragement, and was made more sensible of it
every hour. even after I had got the first handful of seed-
eorn, which, as I have said, came up unexpectedly, and indeed
to a surprise.

First, 1 had no plou h to turn up the earth; no spade or
shovel to dig it: well, t is I conquered by makiu a wooden
spade, as I observed before; but this did my war but in a
wooden manner ; and though it cost me a great many days to
make it, yet. for want of iron, it not only were out the sooner,
but made my work the harder, and performed it much worse.
However, this I bore with, and was content to work it out
with patience, and bear with the badness of the performance.
When the corn was sown, I had no harrow, but was ibrced to
go over it myself, and dr a great heav bough of a tree over
it, to scratch it, as it may called rat er than rake or bar-
row it. When it was growing and grown, I have observed
already how many things I wanted to fence it, secure it, mow
or rea it, cure and carry it home, thrash, part It from the
chatfi', nd save it: then I wanted a mill to ind it, steves to
dress it, yeast and salt to make it into brea , and an oven to
bake it; and vet all these things I did without, as shall be ob-
served; and the corn was an inestimable comfort and advan-
ta e to me: all this as I said, made every thing laborious and

ious to me, but at there was no help for; neither was my

a;
.3'
time so much loss to me, because, as 1 had divided it, a cel'tain ' "
part cf it was every day appointed to these works; and as! ~;,

resolved to use none of the corn for bread till I had a greater
quantity by me, I had the next six months to apply myself
wholly, by labor and invention to furnish myself With utensils
proper for the performing all the operations necessary for
making corn fit or my use.

But now I was to prepare more land; for I had seed enou h
to sow above an acre of ground. Before I did this, I h a
week's work, atleast, to make me a s ade; which, when it was
done was but a sorry one indeed an very heavy, and required
double labor to work with it: wever, I went through that.
and sowed my seed in two large, flat pieces of ground, as near
my house as could find them to my mind, and fenced them
in with a good hedge; the stakes of which were all cut off that
wood which I had set before, and knew it would grow; so that,
in one year's time, I knew I should have a quick or living
hedwe that would want but little repair. This work took me
up full three months; because a great part of the time was in
the wet season, when I could not go abroad. Within doors,
that is, when it rained, andI coul not go out I found em--
ployment on the following occasions; always observing, that
while I was at work, I iverted myself with talking to my
parrot, and teaching him to speak; and I quickly learned him
to know his own name, and at last to speak it out pretty loud
Pol; which was the first word I ever heard spoken in the islan
by an mouth but my own. This, therefore was not my
work, at an assistant to my work; for now, as I said, I had a
great employment upon my hands, as follows: I had long
studied, b some means or other, to make in self some earthen
vessels, w ich indeed I wanted much, but new not where to
come at them: however, considering the heat of the climate, 1
did not doubt but if I could find out an clay, I might botch
up some such pot as might, being dri in the sun _be hard
and strong enough to bear handling, and to hold any thing that

msdry, and required to he kept so; and asthis was new

in the reparing corn, meal, &.c., which was the thing I v" '2
upon, resolved to make some as large as I could, and fit only ' --':-'-_
to stand like jars, to hold what shoal be put into them. "

It would make the reader pity me, or rather laugh at me to
tell how many awkward ways 1 took to raise this pastil; what
odd, misshapen, ugly things! made; how many of them fell
in, and how many fell out, the clay not being stiff enough tc
bear its own weight; how many cracked by the over-violent
heat of the sun, being set out too hastily ; and how many fell
in pieces with only removing, as well before as after they were
dried; and, in a_ word, how, after Ilaflng labored hard to
find the clay, to di it, to temper it, to bring it home, and work
it, I could not in e above two large earthen ugly, things (1
cannot call them jars) in about two months' labor.

However, as the sun baked these two very dry and hard,
I liked them very gently up, and set them down again in
two great wicker baskets, which I had made on purpose for
them, that they might not break; and as between the pot and
the basket there was a little room 'to spare, I stuffed it full .
the rice and barley-straw; and these two pots, being to stand ,
always dry, I thought would hold my dry corn, a perhaps
the meal, when the corn was bruised.

Though I miscarried so much in my design for large pots,
yetI made several smaller things with better success; such
as little round pots, flat dishes glitchers, and pipkins, and any
thinghm);I hand turned to; an 8 heat of the sun baked them
ver ar .

gut all this would not answer my end, which was to get an ,
earthen pot to hold liquids, and bear the fire, which none of
these could do. It happened, some time afier, making a pretty
large fire for cookin my meat; when I went to put it out, after
I had done with it, found a broken piece of one of my earth-
engware vessels in the fire, burnt as hard as a stone, and red as
a tile. I was a ably surprised to see it; and said to myself-
that certainly v might be made to burn whole, if they w
burn broken.

I \_ > .1: &

Affluent>>, J a i. said; 3':
This set me to study how to order my fire, so as to make
it burn some pets. I had_no notion of a kiln, such as the
putters burn In, or of glazm them with lead, thouih Ihad
some lead to do it with ;. but placed three large Jaip ins and
two or three pots in a pile, one upon another, an placed my
firewood all round it With a reat heap of embers under them.
I plied the fire with fresh the round the outside, and upon the
top, till I saw the pots in the inside red-hot quite through, and
observed that they did not crack at all: when I saw them
clear red, I let them stand in that heat about five or six hours,
till I found one of them, though it did not crack, did melt or
run; for the sand which was mixed with the clay melted b .
the violence of the heat, and would have run into glass, if
had gone on; so I slacked my fire gradually, till the ts be-
gun to abate of the red color; and watching them night
thzrtl might not let the fire abate too fast, in the morningI
had three ver ' good, I will not say handsome, ipkins, and
two other eart n pots, as hard burnt as could be esired; and
one of them perfectly glazed with the runnin of the sand.

After this experiment, I need not say that wanted no sort
of earthen-ware for my use; butl must needs say, as to the
shapes of them, they were very indifferent as an one may
suppose, as I had no way of making them but as e children
make dirt pies, or as a woman would make pies that never
learned to raise paste. .

No joy at a thing of so mean a nature was ever equal to
mine, when I found I had made an earthen pot that would bear
the tire ; and I had hardly patience to stay till they were cold,
lwf'nre I set one on the fire again, with some water in it, to
tmil me some meat, which it did admirably well; and, with
a piece of a kid I made some very ood broth; though I
u'mted oatmeal, and several other ing ients requisite to make
it so good as I would have had it been.

M 3' next cont'ern was to get a stone mortar to stain ) or heat
some corn in; for as to the mill, there was no thoug It of arc
tiving to that perfection of art with one pair of hands. ToROBINSON ransr m. 33'

sup ly this want I was at a great loss; tor of all trades in the

world, I was as perfectly unqualified for a stone-cutter, as for
any whatever; neither had 1 any tools to go about it with. I
spent many a day to find out a great stone big enough to cut
hollow, and make fit for a mortar; but conld had none at all,
except what was in the solid rock, and which! had no way to
dig or cut out; nor, indeed, were the rocks in the islandot'
sufficient hardness, as they were all of a sandy; crumbling
stone, which would neither bear the weight of a avy pestle,
nor would break the corn without filling it with sand: so, alter
a great deal of time lost in searching for a stone, 1 gave it over
and resolved to look out a great block of hard wood, which I
found indeed much easier; and ettin one as big as I had
strength to stir, I rounded it, and arm it on the outside with
my axe and hatchet; and then, with the help of fire, and infi-
nite labor, made a hollow place in it as the Indians in Brazil
make their canoes. After this, I m e a rent, heavy pestle, or
heater, ot' the wood called iron- ood; an this I prepared and
laid by ainst I had my next crop of corn, when I proposed
to mysel to grind, or rather pound, my corn into meal, to
make my bread.

My next difficulty was, to make a sieve or searce, to dress
my meal, and to part it' from the bran an the husk, without
which I did not see it possible I could have any bread.
This was a most difficult thing, even but to think on; tor!
had nothing like the necessary thing to make it; I mean fine
thin canvass or stuff, to scarce the meal throzfih. Here I was
at a full sto for many months; nor did I re y know what to
do: linen had none lefi, but what was more rags; I had

ats'~hair, but neither knew how to weave it nor spin it; and

ad I known how, here were no tools to work it With; all the

remedy I found for this was, at last recollectingl had, among

' the seamen's clothes which were saved out of the ship some

neckcloths of calico or muslin, With some pieces of these I

made threesmall sieves, proper enou h for the work ' and thus

I made shit! in some years: how did eastwards, I shall
show in its place. figs

e a [It to "' a Q
The baking part was the next thing to be considered, and
howl should make bread when I came to have corn; for, first,
I had no yeast: as to that part there was no supplying the
want; so I did not concern myselfmuch about it; but tor an
oven 1 was indeed puzzled. At length I found out an expe--
dient for that also, which was this: I made some earthen ves-
sels, very broad, but not deep, that is to say, about two feet
diameter, and not above nine inches deep: these I burned in
the fire, as I had done the other, and laid them by; and when
I wanted to bake, I made a great lire upon my hearth, which
I had paved with some 5 uare tiles of my own making and
burning also; but I shoul not call them square.

When the fire-wood was burned into embers, or live coals, I
drew them forward upon the hearth, so as to cover it all over,
and there let them lie till the hearth was very hot; then sweep-
ing away all the embers, I set down my loaf, or loaves, and
covering them with the earthen pot, drew the embers all round
the outsxde of the pot, to keep in and add to the heat' and
thus, as Well as in the best oven in the world, I bake m
barley loaves, and became, in a little time, a good pastry-coo
into the bargain; for I made myself several cakes and pud-
dings of the rice: but made no pies, asI had nothing to put
into them except the flesh of fowls or oats.

It need not be wondered at, if all t tese things took me up
most part of the third year of my abode here; for it is to be
observed, in the intervals of these things I had my new bar-
vest and husbandry to manage. I reaped my corn in its sea-
son, and_carried it home as well as I could, and laid it u in
the ear, in my large baskets, till I had time to rub it out 5 or I
had no floor to thrash it on, or instrument to thrash it Wlth.

And now, indeed, my stock of corn increasing, I really
wanted to build my barns bigger: I wanted :dplace to lay it
up in; for the increase of the corn now yield me so much,
that I had of the barley about twenty bushels, and of rice as
much or more, insomuch that now I resolved to begin to use
it freeiy; for my bread had been quite gone a great while: I

resolved also to see what quantity would be suflicient for me a
whole year, and to sow but once a year.

Upon the whole, I found that the forty bushels of barley and
rice were much more than I could consume in a year; so I
resolved to sow just the same quantity every year that [sowed
the last, in hopes that such a quantity would fully pronde me
with bread, 6w. . _ -

All the while these things were domg, you may be sure to
thoughts ran many times upon the prospect of land which
had seen from the other side of the island; and I was not with-
out some secret wishes that I was on shore there; fancyinF,
that seeing the main land, and an inhabited country, I mug it
find some way or other to convey myself farther, and perhaps
at last find some means of escape.

But all this whileI made no allowance for the dangers of
such a condition, and that I might fall into the hands of save es,
and perhaps such as I might have reason to think far worse an
the Irons and tigers of Africa ; that if I once came in their wer,
I should run a hazard of more than a thousand to one 0 being
killed, and rrhaps of being eaten; for I had heard that the
people of t e Caribbean coast were eannibals, or man-eaters;
and I knew, 'lli'y the latitude, that I could not be far 08' from
that shore. hen supposing the were not cannibals, yet that
they might kill me, as they ha many Europeans who had
fallen into their hands, even when they have been ten or twenty
together; much more I, who was but one, and could make
little or no defence; all these things, I say, which I ought to
have considered well of, and did cast up in my thoughts after-
wards, took up none of my apprehensions at first ' yet my head
ran mightily upon the thought of getting over to the shore.

Now I washed for my boy Xury an the long-boat with the
shoulder-ofi-mutton sail, with which I sailed above a thousand

' miles on the coast of Africa; but this was in vain: then I

thought I would and look at our ship's boat, which, as I
haveaaid,waa bown upuponthosherea atwa ,inthe
storm, when we were first cut away. She a; near where

the waves and the winds, almost bottom upward, against a
high ridge of beachy rough sand; but no water about her as
before. If I had had hands to have refitted her, and to have
launched her into the water, the boat would have done very
well, and I might have gone back into the Brazils with her
easily enough; but I might have foreseen, that I could no
more turn her and set her upright upon her bottom, than I
could remove the island; however, I went to the woods and
cut levers and rollers, and brought them to the boat, resolvin
to try what I could do; suggesting to myself, that if I coul
but turn her down, and repair the damage she had received,
sheh would be a very good heat, and I might venture to sea
in er.

I spared no pains, indeed, in this piece of fruitless toil, and
spent, I think, three or four weeks about it: at last, findin it
impossible to heave her up with my little strength,l fel to
diggin away the sand, to undermine her, and so as to make
her fallgdown, setting pieces of wood to thrust and guide her
ri ht in the fall. '

ut when I had done this, I was unable to stir her up again,
or to get under her, much less to move her forward towards
the water; so I was forced to give it over; and yet, though
I gave over the ho es of the boat, my desire to venture over
the main increase , rather than dnninished, as the means for
it seemed impossible.

At length, I began to think whether it was not possible to
make myself a canoe, or periagua, such as the natives of those
climates make, even without tools, or, as I might sa ', without
hands, of the trunk of a great tree. - This I not on y thought
possible, but eas ', and pleased myself extremely With the i ea
of making it,,an with my havin much more convenience for
it than any of the Negroes or In ians; but not at all consider-
ing the particular inconveniences which I lay under more than
lhe Indians did, viz. the want of hands to move it Into the water
when it was made--a diflieulty much harder for me to sur-
mount than all the consequences of want of tools could be to
them; forvvhat could it and me,if,afier I had chosen my

tree, and with much trouble cut it down, and might be able
with my tools to hew and dub the outside into the p r
shape of a boat, and burn or cut out the inside to make it -
low, so as make a boat of it; if, after all this, I must leave it
inst where I found It, and was not able to launch it into the
water

One would imagine, if I had had the, least reflection upon
my mind of my circumstances while I was making this boat,
I should have immediately thought how I was to get it into the
sea; but my thoughts were so intent'u n my voyage in it,
that I never once considered how I shou d get It Off the land ;
and it was really, in its own nature, more easy for me to guide
it over forty-live miles of sea, than the forty-five fathoms of
land, where it lay, to set it afloat In the water.

I went to work upon this boat the most like a fool that ever 1
man did, who had any of his senses awake. I pleased in self "-'
with the design, without determinin whether I was abe tog:
undertake it; not but that the dithcu ty of launching my boat
came often into gly head; but I put a stop to my own inquiries
into it, by this f ish answer: Let me first make it; I warrant
I will find some way or other to get it along when it is done.

This was a most preposterous method; but the eagerness of
my fancy prevailed, and to work I went. I felled a cedar-tree,
and I uestion much whether Solomon ever had such a one
for the nilding of the Temple at Jerusalem; it was five feet

, ten inches diameter at the lower part next the stump, and four
feet eleven inches diameter at the end of twenty~two feet,
where it lessened, and then arted into branches. It was not
without infinite labor that I elled this tree; I was twenty days
hacking and he'wing at the bottom, and fourteen more tting
the branches and limbs, and the vast spreading head it, cut
of: aftg'this, it cost me a month to shape it and dub it toa
pro raw, and to sometlung like the bow of a boat, that it
1mg tswim up 5m as it on htfido. It cat me near three

G;-- months more to ear the inst e,'a"nd work it out so as to make

brought it to be a very handsome periagua, and big enough to
have carried six and twenty men, and consequently big
enou rh to have carried me and all my car 0.

When 1 had gone through this Work, was extremely de-
lighted with it. The boat was really much bigger than ever
1 saw a canoe or periagua, that was made of one tree, in my
life. Many a weary stroke it had cost, you may be sure; and
there remained nothing but to get it into the water; which,
had I accomplished, I make no question but [should have
begun the maddest voya 'e, and the most unlikely to be per-
lbrlned, that ever was un ertaken.

But all my devices to get it into the water failed me, though
they cost me inexpressible labor too. it lay about one hundred
yards from the water, and not more; but the first inconve-
nience was, it was up hill towards the creek. Well, to take away
this discouragement, I resolved to dig into the surface of the
earth, and so make a deelivity: this 1 be an, and it cost me a
prodigious deal of pains; (but who gru ge pains that have
their deliverance in view-e? when this was worked through
and this difficulty manag , it was still much the same, for
could no more stir the canoe than I could the other heat. Then
I measured the distance of ground, and resolved to cut a dock
or canal, to bring the water up to the canoe, seeing I couhl
not bring the canoe down to the water. Well, I be an this
work ; and when I began to enter upon it, and calcu ate how
deep it was to be dug, how broad, how the stufi' was to be
thrown out, I found by the number of hands I had, having
none but my own that it must have been ten or twelve
years before I could have gone through with it; for the shore
:ty so high, that at the upper end it must have been at least
twenty feet deep : this attempt, thou rh with great reluctaucy,
l was at length obliged to ive ever .ilso. ' ,r ' -

This grieved me heartilgy; and now I saw, thoughtbolate
the folly of beginning a work before we count the cost, an
bean; we judge rightly "of our own strength to go through
wr it.

place, and kept my anniversary with the same devotion, and
with as much comfort as before; for. by a constant study and
serious application to the word of God, and b the assistance
of his grace, I gained a difi'erent knowled e rom what I had
before; I entertained difi'erent notions of t ings ' I looked now
upon the world as a thing remote which I ha nothing to do
With no ex ctation from, and, indeed, no desires about: in a
word, I ha nothing to do with it, nor was ever likely to have;
I thought it looked, as we may perhaps look upon it hereafier
viz. as a place I had lived in, but was come out of it; and we
might I say, as father Abraham to Dives, " Between me and
thee is a reat ulf fixed."

In the first ace I was here removed from all the wicked-
ness of the world; I had neither the lust of the flesh, the lust
of the eye, nor the pride of life. I had nothing to covet, for I
had all that I was now capable of enjoy'nF: I was lord of the
whole manor; or, if I pleased,l might cal m
peror over the whole country which I had possession ; there
were no rivals; I had no com etitor, none to dispute sove-
reignty or command with me: might have raised ship-load-
inis of corn, but'I had no use for it; so I let as little grow as
l t ought enough for my occasion.. I had tortoise or turtle
eiioug , but now and then one was as much as I could put to
any use: I had timber enough to have built a fleet of ships'
and I had grapes enough to have made wine, or to have on
into raisins, to have loaded that fleet when it had been built.

But all I could make use of was all that was valuable: I had
enough to eat-and supply my wants, and what was the rest to

me? If I killed more flesh than 1 could eat, the dog must eat

it, or vermindeg if I sowed more com than I could eat, it must

be spoiled; the trees that I cut down were lying to rot on the

around ; I could make no more use of them than for fuel, and
rat I had no other occasion for but to dress my food,

In a word, the nature and ex ace of things dictated to
me, u it just reflection, that al the good things of this world
areofpi'io further goodtousthanforouruse; andthatwhat-
ever we may lfiap up to give 'others, we enjoy any as much

yself kin or em- 9""
as we can use, and no more. The most covetous grlpmg
miser in the world would have been cured ofthe vice ol covet-
ousness, if he had been in my case; for I possessed infinitely
more than I knew what to do with. I had no room for desire,
except it was for things which I had not, and they were com-
paratively but trifles, though indeed of great use tome. I had,
as! hinted before, a parcel ofmoney, as well gold as silver, about
thirty-six pounds sterling. Alas! there the nasty, sorry, use-
less stuff lay: I had no manner of business for it; and I often
thought within myself, that I would have given a handful of it
for a gross of tobacco-pipes, or for a hand-mill to grind my
com; nay, I would have iven it all for six entry-worth oftur-
nip and carrot seed from ' ngland, or for a iandful of eas and
beans, and a bottle of ink. As it was, 1 had not the east ad-
vantage by it, or benefit from it; but there it lay in a drawer,
and grew mouldy with the damp of the cave in the wet sea-
sons; and if I had had the drawer full of diamonds, it had been
the same case,----they had been of no manner of value to me.
because of no use.

I had now brou ht my state of life to be much more com-
fortable in itself t an it was at first, and much easier to my
mind, as well as to my body. I fre uently sat down to meat
with thankfulness, and admired the and of God's providence,
which had thus spread my table in the wilderness; I learned
to look more upon the bright side of my condition, and less
upon the dark side, and to consider what I enjoyed, rather
than what I wanted; and this gave me sometimes such secret
comforts, that I cannot express them; and which I take notice
of here, to put those discontented ple in mind of it, who
cannot enjoy comfortably what G has given them, because
they see and covet something that he has not iven them. All
our discontents about what we want, appeared to medo spring
from the want of thankfulness for what we have.

Another reflection was of reat use to me, and doubtless
would be so to an .one that s ould fall into such distress as
mine was; and was, to compare my present condition
nth whatl at first expected it would be; nay, with what it
Would certainly have been, if the good providence of God had
not wonderfull ordered the ship to be cast up near to the
shore, where not only could come at her, but could bring
what I got out of her to the shore, for my relief and comfort;
without which, I had wanted for tools to work, weapons for
defence, and gunpowder and shot for'fietting my food.

I spent whole hours, I may say wh 0 days, in representin
to in 'self, in the most lively colors, how I must have acted i
I ha got nothing out of the ship. I could not have so much
as got any food, except fish and turtles; and that, asit was
long before 1 found any of them, I must have perished; that I
should have lived, if I had not perished, like a mere savafitr
that if I had killed a goat or a fowl, by any contrivance, I ad
no way to flay or open it, or art the flesh from .the skin and
the bowels, or to cut it up; ut must gnaw it With my teeth,
and pull it with my claws, like a beast.

These reflections made me very sensible of the goodness
of Providence to me, and very thankful for my resent condi-
tion, with all its hardslii s and misfortunes; an this part also
i cannot but recomnieii to the reflection of those whom apt,
in their misery, to say, Is any aflii ' 'Zlike minel Let them
consider how much worse the c5593 some people are, and
their case might have been, if Providence had thought fit.

I had another reflection, which assisted me also to comfort
my mind with hopes; and this was, comparing my present
condition with what I had deserved, and had therefore season
to expect from the hand of Providence. 1 had lived a _ til
life, erfectly destitute of the knowledge and fear of
had en well instructed by my father and mother 5 .,
had they been wanting to me, in their endeavors to who: an
early religious awe of God into ni mind, asense of my duty,
and what the nature and end 0 my being required of _me.
But, alas! falling early into the seafaring life, which, of all lives,
is the most destitute of the fear of God, thou h his terrors are
always before them; I'say. falling early into seafarin life,
and into seafaring company that little sense of gin.
which I had entertained was laughed out of me by!!! me.-
mates, by a hardened des ising of dangers, and the views of
death, which rew habitu to me; by my long absence from
all manner 0 opportunities to converse with any thing but
what was like myself, or to hear any thing that was good, or
tending towards it.

So void was I of every thing that was good, or of the least
sense of what I was, or was to be, that in the greatest deliver-
ancesl en'oyed (such as my escape from Sallee, my being
taken up by the Portuwuese master of a ship, my beurg

lanted so well in the Emails, my receivin the car ofrom
"naland, and the like),I never had once tie words, I'hank
G , so much as on my mind or in my mouth; nor in the
greatest distress had I so mm: as a thought to pray to him,
or so much as to say, Lord, have mercy upon me! no, nor to
mention the name of God, unless it was to smear by,and blas-
pheme it. .

I had terrible reflections upon my mind for many months
as I have already observed, on account of my wicked an
hardened life past; and when I looked about me, and consid-
ered what particular providences had attended me smce my
coming into this place, and how God had dealt bountifully'
with me,---had not only punished me less than my iniquity
had deserved, but had so plentifuliy provided for me,---this

ave me reat hopes that my repentance was accepted, and
at God ad yet mercies in store for me.

With these reflections I worked my mind up, not only to a'

resignation to the will of, God in the present disposition of my
circumstances, but even to a sincere thankfulness for my con-
dition; and that l, whowas yet a living man, on ht. not to
com lain, seeing I had not the due punishment my sins;
that enioyed so many mercies which I had no reason to have
expected in that place, that I ought never .more to re ine at
my condition, but to rejoice, and to give daily thanks or that
daily bread which nothing but a crowd of wonders could have
brought; that [ought to consider l-had been fed by a miracle,
even as great as that of feeding Elijah by ravens; nay, by a

lace in the uninhabitable art of the world where I could
rave been cast more to my a vantage; a place where,as I had
no society, which was my affliction on one hand, sol found no
ravenous beasts, no furious wolves or tigers, to threaten my
life; no venomous or poisonous creatures which 1 might feed
on to my hurt; no sav s to murder and devour me. In a
word, as my life was a ife of sorrow one way, so it was a life
of mercy another; and I wanted nothin to make it a life of
comfort, but to make myself sensible of od's goodness to me,
and care over me in this condition; and after I did make a
just imgrovement of these things, 1 went away, and was no
more sa .

I had now been here so long, that many things which-l
brou ht on shore for my help were either quite gone, or very
muc wasted, and near spent. .

My ink as I observed, had been gone for some time, all but
a very lit , which I eked out with water, a little and a httle,
till it was so ale, it scarce left any appearance of black upon
the pa r. Ks long as it lasted, I made use of It to minute
down t e days of the month on which any remarkable thing
happened to me; and, first, by casting up times past, 1 us
member that there was a stran concurrence of days in the
various providences which bef me, and which, if I had been
superstitiously inclined to observe days as fatal or fortunate, I
might have had reason to have looked upon with a great deal
of curiosity. .

First, I ad observed, that the same day that I broke away
from my father and mg-friends, and ran away to Hull in ordei
to go to sea,the same ay afterwards I has taken by the Sallee
man-of-war, and made a slave: the same da of the ear th at
I escaped out of the wreck of the ship in armout Roads,
that same day-year afterwards I made my escape from S met:
in the boat; and the same day of the vear l was born on, viz.
the 30th of September, that same dayI had my life so miracu-
lously saved twenty-six years after when l was cast on shore

in this island: so that my wicked life and my solitary life be '

run both on one day.
The next thing to my ink being wasted, was that of my
bread ; I mean the biscuit which I broplght out of the ship : tlus
[ had husbanded to the last degree, owin myself but one
cake of bread a day for above a year; an yet I was uite
without bread for near a year before I at any com o my
own; and great reason I had to be thank ul that I had any at
all, the getting it, being, as has been a'keady observed, next to

miraculous.

My clothes, too, began to decay mi htily : as to linen, I had
none for a great while, exce t some 0 eckered shirts, which 1_
found in the chests of the ot er seamen, and which I carefully
preserved, because many times I could bear no clothes on but
a shirt; and it was a ver great help to me, that I had, among
all the men's clothes of t e ship almost three dozen of shirts.
There were also, indeed severai thick watch-coats of the sea-
men's which were left, but they were too hot to wear; and
though it is true that the weather was so violently hot that
there was no need of clothes, yet I could not go quite naked;
, no, thou h I had been inclined to it, which I was not; nor
could I a ide the thought of it, though I was all alone. The
reason why 1 could not go [11;qu naked, was, I could_not bear
the heat of the sun so we when quite naked as With some
clothes on; nay, the very heat frequently blistered my skin '
whereas, with a shirt on, the air itself made some motion, and
whistling under the shirt, was twofold cooler than Without it.
No more could I ever bring myself to go' out in the heat of the
sun without a cap or hat; the heat of the sun heating with
.such violence as it does in that place, would give me the head-
ache presently, by dafiing so directly upon my head without
a cap or hat on so that 1 could not bear it; whereas, if I put on
my at, it would presently go away.

Upon these views, I hen-an to consider about puttintIr the
few rags I had, which I czflled clothes, into some order: I had
worn out all the waistcoats I had, and my usiness was now to
try if I could not make _ jackets out of the. great watch-coats
that I had by me,- . nd withsnch other materials as I. had ' so"
I set to wor a tailoring, 0'? rather, indeed. a batching, fix I

It
made most piteons Work of it. However, I made shift to make
two or three new waistcoats, which I hoped would serve me a
great while: as for brooches or drawers, [made but a very sorry
shift indeed till afterwards.

I have mentioned, that I saved the skins of all the creatures
that I killed, I mean four-footed ones; and l had hung them
up, stretched out with sticks, in the sun, by which means
some of them were so'fiy and h'trd that they were ht tor lrltle;
but others I found vcr'y'pseful. The first thing I made of these
was a great cap for my head, with the hair on the ontstde, to
shoot olfthe rain ; and this 1 performed so well, tb'it after this
I made me a-suit of clothes wholly of the skins; that is to say,
a waistcoat, and breeches open at the knees, and both loose;
for'they were rather wanting to keep the cool than warm. I must
not omit to acknowledge that they were wretchedly made ; for
if I was a bad carpenter,l was a worse tailor. However, they
were such as I made very good shift with; and when I was
abro'ul, if it happened to rain, the hair of my waistcoat and
cap being uppermost, I was kept very dry.

After this I s wnt a greatile'rl oftime and pains to make me
an umbrella: was indeed in great want of one, and bad a
great mind to make one: I h'ul seen them nytde in the Brazils,
where they were very useful in the great heats which are
there; and l felt the beats every jot as great here, and yre'xter
too, being nearer the equinox: besides, as l was obliged to be
much abroad, it was a most useful thing to me, as well for the
rains as the heats. I took a world of pains at it, and was a
great while before I could make any thing likely to hold; nay,
after I thought I had hit the way, 1 s roiled two or three before
_1 made one to my mind; but at last l made one that answered
In'dttferently well ; the main difficulty, I found, was to make it
to let down : [could make it spread, but ifit did not let down
too, and draw in, if 'as not portable for me any way but just

I said, I made one ) answer, and covered it with skins, the
hair upwards, so that it cast olf the rain like a pent-house, and
kept off the sun so effectually, that I could walk out in the"4 kt mxsox (fltC.SUlI.

hottest ol' the iveather with renter advantage than I could
before in the coolest; and w en I had no need of it, could
close it, and carry it under my arm. . _

Thus I lived mighty comfortably, my mind being entirely

omposed by resiguin to the will of God, and throwing in -
SSlf wholly upon the is osal of his providence. This ma o
my life better than socia le; for when I-began to regret the
want of conversation, I would ask mykll', whether thus con.
t'ersiiig mutually with my own thoughts, and, as I hope I may
say, With even God himself, by ejaculations, was not better
than the utmost enjoyment of human society in the world?

I cannot say that after this, for five years, any extraordinary
thing happened to me, but I lived on in the same course, in
the same posture and lace, just as before: the chief thin s l
was employ d in besi es my yearly labor of planting "13' ar-
ley and rice, and curing my raisins. of both which I z ways
kept u i just enough to have sufficient stock of one year's pro~
vision beforehand; I say, besides this yearly labor, and my
daily pursuit of going out with my un, I had one labor to
make me a canoe, which at last I finis led; so that by digging a
canal to it of six feet wide, and four feet deep, I brought it into
the creek, almost half a mile. As for the first, which was.so
vastly big, as I made it without considering beforehand, as I
ought to do, how I should be able to launch it, so, never being
able to bring it into the water, or bring the water to it, I was
obliged to let it liewhere it was, as a memorandum to teach
me to be wiser the next time; indeed, the next time, though I
could not get a tree proper for it, and was in a lace where I
could not Iret the water to it at any less distance t an, as I have
said, near alf a mile, yet as I saw it was practicable at last,l
never gave it over; and though 1 was near two years about it,
yet I never grudged my labor, in hopes of having a boat to go
off to sea at .ist. "

However, though my little periagua w finished, yet the
size of it was not at all answerable to the sign which I had
in view when I made the first; I mean, of venturing over to
the terrafima, where it was above forty miles broad; accord-

desrgn, and now I thong t no more of it. AsI had a boat,
my next design was to make a cruise round the island; for as
I had been on the other side in one place, crossing, as I have
already described it, over the land, so the discoveries I made
in that little journey made me very eager to see other parts
of the coast; and now I had a boat, I thought of nothing but
sailing round the isl . _ .

For this purpose, that 1 might do every thing with discretion
and consideration, I fitted up a little mast in my boat, and
made a sail to it out of some of the Ipieces of the ship's sails
which lay in store, and of which I ad a great stock by me.
Having fitted my mast and sail, and tried the boat, I found she
would sail very well: then I made' little lockers, or boxes, It
etch end of my boat, to put provisions, necessaries, ammu-
nition, Gee. into, to be kept dry, either from rain or the 3 ray
of the sea; and alittle long, hollow place I cut in the insi e of
the boat, where I can d lay my gun, making a flap to hang
down over it, to kee it dry.

I fixed my umbre a also in a step at the stern, like a roast,
to stand over my head, and keep t e heat of the sun 03' me,
like an awnin ; and thus I every now and then took a little
voyage u n e sea, but never went far out, nor far from the
little cree . At last, being ea r to view the circumference
of my little kin dom,l resolv upon my cruise; and accord-
ingly I victual ed my Shifi for the voyage, utting In two
dozen of loaves (cakes I s ould rather c em) of barley
bread, an earthen pot full of parched rice (a food I ate a great
deal of), a little bottle of rum, half a goat, and powder and
shot for killing more, and two large watch-coats, of those
which, as I mentioned before, I had saved out of the seamen':.:
chests; these I took, one to lie upon, and the other to cover
me In the night. . . _

It was the 6th of November, in the sixth ear of my rel ,

<<ugly, the smallness of m boat assisted to put an em: to that '
to the east side of it, I found a great ledge of rocks lie out about
two leagues intothe sea, some above water some under it; and
beyond that a shoal of sand, lying dry half a league more, so
grad 'was obliged to go a great way out to sea to double

e int.

hen first I discovered them, I was going to give over my
enterprise, and come back again, not ltnowimr how far it
might oblige me to go out to sea, and, above all, doubting how
Is ould get back again; sol came to an anchor; for had
made me a kind of an anchor with a piece of a broken grapo
plifig which I got out of the ship.

avtng secured m boat, I took my gun and went on shore,
climbing up on a h' l, which seemed to overlook that point,
where I saw the full extent oi'it, and resolved to venture.

In my viewing the sea from that hill, where I stood, l per-
ceived a stron , and indeed a most furious current, which ran
to the east, an even came close to the point; and I took the
more notice of it, because I saw there might be some danger,
that when I came into it, I might be carried out to sea by the
stren th of it, and not be able to make the island again; and,
indee , had 1 not at first upon this hill,l believe it would
have been so; for t ere was the same current on the other side
the island, only that it set of? at a further distance, and I saw
there was a strong eddy under the shore; so I had nothing to
do but to et out of the first current, and I should presently
be in an e dy.

I lay here, however, two days, because the wind blowinrr
pretty fresh at E.S.E., and that being just contrar ' to the saiil
current, made a great breach of the sea upon t re point; so
that it was not safe for me to keep too close to the shore for
the breach, nor to go too far off because of the stream.

The third day, in the morning, the wind having abated
over night, the sea was calm, and" ventured; but I am a
warning-piece again to all rash and ignorant pilots; for no
sooner was I come to the point, when l was not even my boat's
length from the shore, but I found myself in a great depth of
water, and a current like the sluice of a mill: it carried my

it
boat along with it with such violence, that all I could do could
not keep er so much as on the edge of it; but I found it hur-
ried me farther and farther out from the eddy, which was on
my left hand. There was no wmd stirring to help me and all
I could do with my paddles signified nothing: and now I
began to give myself over for lost; for as the current was on
both sides of the island, I knewin a few leagues' distance they
must join again, and then I was irrecoverablg gone; nor did
I see any gossibility of avoiding it; so that I a no prospect
before me ut of perishin ; not by the sea, for that was calm
enough, but of starving gar hunger. 1 had, indeed, found a
tortoise on the shore, as bi almost asI could lifi, and had
tossed it into the boat; and I had a great jar of fresh water, that
is to say, one of my earthen pots; but what was all this'o
bein driven into the vast ocean, where, to be sure, there was
:10 sqore, no main land or island, for a thousand leagues at
east

And now I saw how easy it was for the providence of God
to make even the most miserable condition of mankind worse.
Now I looked back upon my desolate, solitary island, as the
most pleasant place in the world; and all the happiness my
heart could wish for was to be but there ain. I stretched
out my hands to it, with eager wishes: " ha y desert!"
said I, " I shall never see thee more. 0 misera e creature!
whither am! going?" Then 1 reproached myself with my
unthankful temper, and how I had repined at my solitary con-
dition; and now what would I give to be on shore there againl.
Thus we never see the true state of our condition till it is illus--
trated to us by its contraries, nor know how to_ value what .we
enjoy, but by the want of it. It is scarce possible to imagine
the consternation I was now in, being driven from my beloved
island (for so it appeared to me now to be), into the Wide
ocean, almost two ues, and in the utmost des air of ever
recovering it ain. owever, I worked hard, t' indeed my
strength was most exhausted, and kept my boat as much to
the northward, that is, towards the side of thch

theeddy layon,upoeniblylcould; when M"!
sun passed the meridian,l thought] felt a little breeze oi
wind in m face springin up from S.S.E. This cheered my
heart a lit e, and especiallgy, when, in about half an hour more,
it blew a pretty entle gale. By this time I was ot at a
frightful distance rom the island; and had the least c oudy or
hazv weather intervened, I had been undone another way too;
for I had no compass on board, and should never have known
how to have steered towards the island, if I had but once lost
sight of it; but the weather continuing clear, I applied myself
to get up my mast again, and spread my sail, standing away
to the north as much as possible, to et out of the current.

Just as I had set my mast and sai , and the boat began to
stretch away, I saw, even by the clearness of the water, some
alteration of the current was near; for where the current was
so strong, the water was foul; but perceivin the water clear,
I found the current abate; and presently I mind to the east,
at about half a mile, a breach of the sea upon some rocks;
these rocks I found caused the current to part a am, and as
the main stress of it ran away more southerly, caving the
rocks to the north-east, so the other returned by the repulse
of the rocks, and made a stron eddy, which ran back again
to the north-west, with a very s arp stream.

They who know what it Is to have a reprieve brought to
them it on the ladder, or to be rescued from thieves just going
to mur er them, or who have been in such like extremities,
may guess what my present surprise of 'oy was, and how
gladly 1 put my boat into the stream of t is eddy; and the
wind also freshening, how gladly I spread my sail to it, run-
ning cheerfully before the wind, and with a strong tide or
eddy under foot. .

This eddy carried me about a lea ue in my way back
again, directly towards the island, but aiout two eagues more
to the northward than the current which carried me away at
first; so that, when I came near the island, I found myself
open to the northern shore of it, that is to say, the other end
0 the island, opposite to that which I went out from. _

When I had made something more than a league of way by.

served me no further. However, I found that luring lwtween
two great currents, viz. that on the south side, which had hur-
ried me away, and that on the north, which lay ahout a league
on the other side: I say, between these two, in the wake of
the island,I found the \\':lI('l' at. least still, and running no
way; and having still a breeze of wind fair for me, I kept on
steering directly for the island, though not making such h'esh

Xhout four o'clock in the evening, being then within a
league of the island, I found the point of the rocks which oc-
castoned this disaster, stretclliugr out, as is described hetiire,
to the southward, and casting: off the current more southerly
had, of course, made another eddy to the north; and this I
found very stroiw, but not directly setting the way my course
lay, which was ue west, but. almost full north. However,
having a fresh gale, I stretched across this eddy, slanting
north--west; and in about an hour, came within about a mile
of the shore, where, it being smooth water, I soon get to land.

When I was on shore I fell on my knees, and rave God
thanks for my deliverance, resolrin to lay aside all: thoughts

guch things as I had, I brought my boat close to the shore in a

ha becn'in a little dock made on purpose for her. Herel
put in, and having stowed my boat very safe, I went on shore,
to look about me, and see where I was.

I soon found I had but a little passed by the place where I
had been before, when I travelled on foot to that shore; so,
taking nothing out of my boat but my un and umbrella,--for
it was exceeding hot,----I began my marc . The way was com-
fortable enough after such a voyage as I had been upon, and
I reached my old bower in the evening, where I found every
thing standing as I left it; for I always kept it in good order,
being, as I said before, my country-house.

in, when I was awaked out of m sleep by a vorce calling me
by mv name several times, " obin, Robin R0 in Crusoe;
poor Robin Crusoe! Where are you, Robin rusoe'l Where
are you'! Where have you been?" _

l was so dead aslee at first, being fatigued with rowrng or
paddlincr, as it is calle , the first part of the day, and with walk-
ing the latter part, that I did not wake thoroughly ' but dozmg
between sleeping and waking, thoughtI dreamed that some-
body spoke to me; but as the voice continued to repeat Robin
Crusoe, Robin Crusoe, at last I began to wake more perfectly,
and was at first dreadfully frightened, and started up In the
utmost consternation; but no sooner were my eyes open, but
I saw my Pol sittin on the top of the hedge; and immediate-
ly knew it was he that spoke to me; for just in such bemoan-
ing language I had used to talk to him, and teach him; and
he had learned it so perfectly, that he would sit u n m fin-
ger, and lav his bill close to m face, and cry, " oor bin

came you here? " and such things as _I had taught him.

However, even though I knew it was the arrot, and that
indeed it could be nobody else it was a 3 while before I
could compme myself. First, I, was amazed how the creature

ued talking to me, l'oor Robin Crusoe! and how did I come

to see me z rain; and so I carried him home along, with me.

I now ha enough of rambling to sea for some time, and had
enough to do for many days, to sit still, and reflect upon the
danger I had been in. I Would have been very glad to have
had my boat again on my side of the island; but I knew no:
how it was practicable to get it about. As to the east side of
the island, which I had gone round, I know well enough there
was no venturing that way ; my very heart would shrink, and
my very hlood run chill, but to think (Ill; and as to the other
side of the island, 1 did not know how it might be there; but.

the island, as 1 had been helbrc of being carried away from it;
so, with these thoughts, I contented myself to be without any
boat, though it had been the product of so many montlis' la~
her to make it, and ot'so many more to get it into the sea.

_ In this government of my temper I remained near a year,
lived a very sedate, retired life, as you may well suppose ; and
my thoughts being very much composed, as to my condition,
and fully comforted in resigning myself to the dispositions of

_ Prowdence, I thought I lived really very happily in all things,

earthenware, and contrived well enough to make them with

fiirted with it, for 1 had been always used to smoke; and there
were ipes in the ship, but I for otlthem at first, not think
ing t at there was tobacco in t e Island; and afterwards,
when I saffrched the ship again, 1 could not come at any

it my wicker-ware also I improved much, and made abun-
dance of necessary baskets, as well as my invention showed '
me: though not very handsome, yet they were such as were
very handy and convenient for my laying things up in, or
fetching things home. For example, if I lulled a goat abroad,
I could hang it up in a tree, flay it, dress it, and out it in
nieces, and bring it home in a basket; and thelike by a turtle;
l could cut it up, take out the eggs, and a piece or twoof the
flesh, which was enough for me, and bring them. home in
a basket, and leave the rest behind me. Also large deep bas-
kets were the receivers of my corn, which I always rubbed
out as soon as it was dry, and cured, and kept it in great
baskets.

I began now to perceive my powder abated considerably : this
was a want which it was impossible for me to supply and I be--
gan seriously to consider what I must do when I should have no
more powder; that is to say,how I should doto kill any goats.
I had, as is observed, in the third year of my being here, kept
a young kid, and bred her up tame, and l was in hopes of
getting a h oat; but I couh not. by any means bring it to
pass, till my Id rew an old goat; and as I could never find
in my heart to ki . .her', she died at last of mere age. .

But being now in the eleventh year of my residemze, and,
asl have said, my ammunition growing Iow,l set myself in
study some art totrap and snare the goats,to see whether!
could not catch some of them alive ; and particularly I wanted
a she-goat great with oung. For this purpose, I made snares
to hamper them; an I do believe they were more than once
taken in them; but my tackle was not , for I had no
wire, and I always found them broken, an my bait devoured.'
At length I resolved to try a pitfall; so] dug several largo
pits in the earth, in places where I had observed the goats
used to feed, and over those pits I placed hurdles, of myan
making too, with a great weightupon them; and several tunes

I put ears of barley and dry tree, without setting the trap {3'

and I could easily rceive that the goats had gone in an
eaten u the corn, ,or I could see the marks of their feet. At
length set three traps in one night, and gomg the next morn-
ing, I found them all standing, and et the bait eaten and
gone: this was very discouraging. owever, I altered my
traps; and, not to trouble you with particulars, going one
morning to see my tra s, I found in one of them a large dd
he-goat, and in one o the others three kids, a male and two
females. '

.As to the old one, I knew not what to do with him; he was
so fierce, I durst not go into the pit to him; that is to say, to

0 about to brin him away alive, which was what I wanted:
Icould have k' ed him, but that was not my business, mp
would it answer in end ' so I even let him out, and he ran.
away, as if he had n rightened out of his wits. But I did
not then know, what I afierwards learnt, that hun r will tame
a lion. If I had let him sta there three or four ays without
food, and then have carried im some water to drink and then
a little corn, he would have been as tame as one of, the kids;
lbr they are mighty sagacious, tractable creatures, where they
are we I used. _

However, for the present I let him go, knowing no better at
that time: then I went to the three kids, and taking them one
by one, I tied them with strings together, and With some diffi-
culty brought them all home. ,

It was a good while before they would feed; but throwing
them some sweet corn, it tempted them, and they began to

a
be tame. And now I found that if I expected to sup ly my-
self with goat's flesh when I had no powder or s ot let

breeding some up tame was my only way; when, perhaps, 1
might have them about my house like a flock of sheep. But
then it occurred to me, that I must keep the tame from the
wild, or else they would always run wild when they rew up;
and the only way for this was, to have some Incl piece of
ground, wel fenced, either with hedge or pale, to keep them
ui so efi'ectually, that those within might not break out, or

' 'those without break in.

This was a great undertaking for one pair of hands; yet as
I saw there was an absolute necessity for doing it, my first
work was to find out a proper piece of ground, where there
was likely to be herbage for them to eat, water for them to
drink, and cover to keep them from the sun.

Those who understand such inclosures will think I had very
little contrivance, when I pitched upon a place very proper
for all these (being a plain open piece of meadow land, or sa-
vannah, as our peosle call it in the western'colonies), which
had two or three lit e drills of fresh water in it, and at one end
was very woody; I say, theyovill smile at my forecast when

.I shall tell them, I began by mclosing this piece of ground

in such a manner, that my hedge or pale must have been at
least two miles about. Nor was the madness of it so great as
to the compass, for if it was ten miles about, I was like to have
time enough to do it in; but I did not consider that in cats
would be as wild in so much compass as if they had find the
whole island, and I should have so much room to chase them
in, that I should never catch them.

M y hedge was begun and carried on, I believe about fifiy
y-xrds, when this thought occurred to me; so I presently
stopped short, and, for the first. beginnin ,I resolved to in-
close a piece of about 150 arcs in length, and 100 ards in
breadth; which, as it wo d maintain as many as should
have in any reasonable time, so, as my stock increased, I could
add more ground to my inclosure.

This was acting With some prudence, and I went to workw

with coura re. 1 was about three months hedging in the firs
)iece; out ,till I had done it, 1 tethered the three kids in the
est part of it and used them to feed as near me as possible, to
make them familiar; and very often I would go and carry
them some ears of barley, or a handful of rice, and feed them
out of my hand; so that after my inclosure was finished, and
I let them loose, they would follow me up and down, bloating
after me for a handful of com.

This answered my end; and in about a year and a half I
had a flock of about twelve goats kids and all; and in two
years more, I had three and forty, hes-ides several that I took
and killed for my food. After that I inclosed five. several
pieces of ground to feed them in, with little pens to drive them
into, to ta e them as I wanted, and gates out of one piece of
ground into another.

But this was not all; for now I not only had goat's flesh to
feed on when I pleased, but milk too--a thin!1r which, indeed,
in the beginning, I did not so much as thing of, and which,
when it came into my thoughts, was real] an agreeable sur.
prise; for now I set up my dairy, and ha sometimes a gallon
or two of milk in a day. And as nature, who gives supplies
of food to every creature, dictates even naturally how to make
use of it so I, that had never milked a cow much less a oat,
or seen hotter or cheese made, only when rwas a boy, a ter a
great many essays and miscarriages, made me both butter and
cheese at last, and also salt (though I found it nrtly made to
my hand by the heat of the sun upon some of tile rocks of the
sea), and never wanted it afterwards. How mercifully can
our Creator treat his creatures, even in those conditions in
which they seemed to be overwhelmed in destruction! How
can he sweeten the bitterest providenoes, and give us cause to

, praise him for dungeons and prisons! What a table was here

eguipi re, and in such a dress. Be pleased to take a sketch
0 my gure, as follows :--

- I had a great, high shapeiess cap, made of a goat's skin.
with a flap hanging down behind, as well to keep the sun
from me as to shoot the rain off from runnin into my neck-
nothing bein so hurtful in these climates as t e rain upon the
flesh, under e clothes.

I had a short jacket of goat's skin, the skirts comin down to
about the middle of the thighs, and a pair ofopen-kn breeches
of the same; the breeches were made of the skin of an old he-

roat, whose hair hung down such a length on either side, that,
like pantaloons it reached to the middle of my legs: stockings
and shoes 1 ha none, but had made me a pair 0 somethings,
l scarce know what to call them, like buskins, to flap over my
legs, and lace on either side like spatterdashes ; but of a mast
barbarous shape, as indeed were all the rest of my clothes.

I had on a broad belt of goat's skin dried which I drew to-
gether with two thongs of the same, instead of buckles; and
in a kind of afrog on either side of this, instead of a sword and
dagger, hung a little saw and a hatchet; one on one side, and
one on the other. I had another belt, not so broad, and {889
tened in the same manner, which him over my shoulder;

made of goat's skin too; in one of which ting my powderfig's
the other my shot. At my back I carried my basket, and
- my shoulder my gun; and over my head, Efrem, clumsy,

ugly, goat's skin umbrella, but which, after , was the most
necessary thing I had about me, next to my un. As for ma
face, the color of it was really not so mulat ike as one mi ht
espect from a man not at all careful of it, and living within
nine or ten degrees of the equinox. My heard I had once
sufi'eredto grow till it was about a quarter of a yard long; but
as I had bot scissors and razors sufficient, I had cut it pretty
short, except what rew on my up r lip, which I had trimmed
into a large pair 0 Mabometan w ' ers, such as_I had seen
worn by some Turks at Sallee; for the Moors did not wear

such, though the Turks did: of those mustache-,0: withing
I will "at say they were long enough to hang my hat upon
them, but they were of a leng'h and shape monstrous enough,
and such as, in England, would have passed for fri htful.

But all this is by the bye; for as to my figure, I ad so few
to observe me, that it was of no manner of consequence; so I
say no more to that part. In this kind of ii are I went my
new journey, and was out five or six days. gltravelled first
alon the sea-shore, directly to the place where I first brought
my t to an anchor, to et upon the rocks; and having no
boat now to take care of fwent over_thc land, a nearer way,
to the same height that I was upon before; when, lookin for-v
ward to the point of the rocks which lay out, and which was
obliged to double with my boat, as is said above, I was sur-
prised to see the sea all smooth and quiet; no ri pling, no
motion, no current, any more there than in any otfier places.
[was at a strange loss to understand this, and resolved to spend
some time in the observin r it, to see if nothing from the sets
of the tide had occasione it; but 1 was presently convinced
how it was, viz. that the tide of ebb setting,r from the west, and
joining with the current of waters from some great river on the
shore, must be the occasion of this current; and that accord-
ing as the wind blew more forcibly from the west, or from the
north, this current came nearer, or went farther from the
shore; for waiting thereabouts till evening, I went u to the
rock again, and then the tide of ebb being made, plainl
saw the current again as before, only that it ran farther o ,
being near half a league from the shore; whereas in my case,
it set close upon the shore, and hurried me and my canoe
alon with it; which, at another time, it would not have done.

T is observation convinced me, that] had nothing to do
but to observe the ebbing and the flowing of the tide, and I
might very easily bring my boat about the island again; but
when I began to think of putting it in practice, I had such a
terror upon in spirits at the remembrance of the danger I had
been in, that could not think of it again with any patience;
but, on the contrary, I took up another resolution, which was
more safe, though more laborious; and this was, that I would
build, or rather make me another periagua or canoe; and so
have one for one side of the island, and one for the other.

You are to understand that now I had, as I may call it,
two plantations in the isIand; one my little fortificatioa or
tent with the wall about it, under the rock, with thc cave be-
hind me, which, by this time, I had enlarged into several
apartments or caves, one within another. One of these, which
was the driest and largest, and had a door out beyond my wall
or fortification, that is to say beyond where my wall joined to
the rock, was all filled up with the large earthen pots, of which
I have given an account, and with ourteen or fifteen great
baskets, which would hold five or six bushels each, where I
laid up my stores of provision, especially my corn, some in the
ear cut off short from the straw, and the other rubbed out
with my hand.

As for my wall, made, as before with long stakes or piles,
those piles grew all like trees, and were by this time grown
so big, and spread so very much that there was not the least
ap carance, to any one's view, of any habitation behind them.

ear this dwelling of mine but a little farther within the
land, and upon lower ground, lay my two ieces of corn land,
which I kept duly cultivated and sowe , and which duly
yielded me their harvest in its season: and whenever I had
occasion for more corn, I had more land adjoining as fit as that.

Besides this, I had my country-seat; and I had now a tol-
erable lantation there also; for, first, I had my little bower,
asI c led it, which I he it in repiir; that is tosay, Ikept
the hedge which encircle it in, constantly fitted up to its-
usual height the ladder standing always in the inside : I kept
the trees, which at first were no more than my stakes, but
were now grown very firm and tall, always out so, that they
might s read and flow thick and wild, and make the more
agreeab e shade; w 'ch they did efl'cctually to my mind. _ .In
the middle ofthisI had my tent always standing, being a piece
of a sail spread over poles, set up for that purpose, and which
never wanted any repair or renewing ."d under this I had
mathmeaeqnabor couch,withtln ahanaofthe mull

'
had killed, and with other soft things; and a blanket laid on
them, such'as belonged to our sea-bedding, which I had saved
and a great watch-coat to cover me; and here whenever
had occasion to be absent from my chief seat, I took up my
country habitation.

Adjoining to this I had my] inclosures for my cattle, that is
to say, my goats; and as I ad taken an inconceivable deal
of pains to tence and inclose this ground, I was so anxious to
see it kc )t entire, lest the goats should break through, that I
Lever lc t elf, till, with infinite labor, I had stuck the outside
of the hedge so full of small stakes, and so near to one another,
that it was rather a pale than a hedge, and there was scarce
room to put a hand through between them; which afterwards,
when those stakes grew, as they all did in the next rainy sea-
son, made the inclosure strong like a wall,--ind'ced, stronger
than any wall.

This will testify for me that I was not idle, and that I spared
no pains to bring to pass whatever appeared necessary for my
comfortable support; for I considered the kee ing up a breed
of tame creatures thus at my hand would be a iving magazine
of flesh, milk, butter, and cheese for me as lon r as I lived in
the place,' if it were to be forty years; and that keeping them
in my reach depended entirely upon my perl'ectintr my in-
clusures to such a degree, that I mi rht be sure of: keeping
them together; which, by this method: indeed, I so effectually
secured, that when these little stakes began to grow, I had
planted them so very thick, that I was forced to pull some of
them up again. '

In this place also I had my grapes growing, which I prin-
cipally de ndcd on for my winter store of raisins, and which
I never fai ed to preserve very carefully, as the best and most
agreeable dainty of my whole diet; and indeed thcy were not
only agreeable but medicinal, wholesome, nourishing, and re-
freshing to the last degree.

As this was also about half-way between my other habitation
and the lace where I had laid u in boat, I generally staid
and lay here, in my way thither; r used frequently to visit
my boat -; and I kept all things about, or belonging to her, in
very good order: sometimes went out in her to divert myself;
but no more hazardous voyages would I 0, nor scarce ever
above a stone's cast or two from the shore, was so apprehen-
sive of being hurried out of my knowled again by the cur
rents or winds, or any other accident. at now I come to a
new scene of my life.

It happened one day, about noon, going towards my boat
I was exceedingly surprised with the print of a man's naked
foot on the shore, which was very plain to be seen in the sand.
I stood like one thunderstruck or as if I had seen an appari-
tion : I listened, I looked round me,.but I could hear nothing,
nor see any thing: I went up to a rising ground to look far-
ther; I went up the shore, and down the shore, but it was all
one; I cauld see no other impression but that one. I went to
it a ain to see if there were any more, and to observe if it
mig t not be my fancy; but there was no room tbr that, for
there was exactly the print of a foot--toes, heel, and every part
of a foot: how it came thither I knew not, nor could I in the
least imagine; but, after innumerable flutterin thoughts, like
a man perfectly confused and out of myself, came home to
my fortification, not feeling, as we say, the ground I went on,
but terrified to the last degree; lookin be ind me at every
two or three steps, mistaking every bus and tree, and fanc .
ing every stump at a distance to be a man. Nor is it possib p
to describe how many various shares my shit hted imags-
nation represented things to me in, ow many w (1 ideas were
found every moment in my fancy, and what strange, unac-
countable whimseys came into my thoughts by the weiy:

When I came to my castle (for sol think I call it ever
after this), I fled into it like one pursued {whether I went over
by the ladder as first contrived, or went in at the hole in the
rock which I had called a door, I cannot remember; no, nor
could I remember the next morning; forhever frightened hare
fled to cover, or fox to earth, with more tenor of mind than I
to this retreat. _

of my fright, the greater my apprehensions were; which is

place? Where was the vewel that brought them? What
marks were there of any other footste 3'! And how was it
ossible a man should come there? ut then to think that
atan should take human shape upon him In_ such a place,
where there could he no manner of occasion lbr it, but to leave
the print of his foot behind him and that even for no purpose
too, for he could not be sure should see 1t,---this _was an
amusement the other way. I considered that the devil might
have found out abundance of other ways to have terrified me
than this of the single print of a foot; that as I lived quite on
the other side of the island, he would never have been so simple
as to leave a mark in a place where it was ten thousand to one
whether I should ever see it or not, and in the sand too, which
the first sur e of the sea, upon a high wind, would have de-
t'iced entire y: all this seemed inconsistent with the thing it-
st if, and with all the notions we usually entertain of the sulmlty
of the devil. , -
Abundance of such things as these assisted to a e me 0.".

. conclud , then, that it must be some more-dangerous creature,
viz. that it must be someof the savages of the main land over
against me, who had wandered outta sea in their canoes, and,
either driven by the currents, or by contrary wmds, had made
the island, and had been on shore, but were. one awaxefiun

While these reflections-were rolling upon my. mind, I was

'which they would have concluded that some inhabitants had
been in the place, and perhaps have searched farther for me;
then terrible thoughts racked my imagination about their
having found my boat, and that there were people here; and
that it so, I should certainly have them come again in greater
numbers, and devour me; that if it should happen so that they
should not find me, yet they would find my melosure, destroy
all my corn, and carry away all my flock of tame goats, and I
should perish at last for mere want.

Thus my fear banished all my religious hope, all that for-
mer confidence in God, which was founded upon such wonder-
ful experience as I had had of his goodness, as if he that had
fed me by miracle hitherto could not preserve, by his power
the provision which he had made for me by his goodness. I
reproached myself with my laziness, that would not sow any
more com one year than would just serve me till the next sea-
son, as it' no accident would intervene to prevent my enjoying
the crop that was upon the ground; and this I thought so just
a reproof, that I resolved tor the future to have twoor three
years' corn beforehand; so that whatever might come, I might
not rish for want of bread.

ow strange a checker-work of Providence is the life of
man! and by what secret difierent springs are the afiections
hurried about, as different circumstances present! To-day
we love what to-morrow we hate; today we seek what to-
morrow we shun; to-day we desire what to-morrow we fear,
nay, even tremble at the apprehensions of; this was exempli-
fied in me, at this time, in the most lively manner imaginable;
for 1, whose only affliction was that I seemed banished from
human society, that I was alone, circumscribed by the bound-
less' ocean, cut off from mankind, and condemned to what I
called silent life; that I was as one whom Heaven thought not
worthy to be numbered among the living, or to appear among
the rest of his creatures; that to have seen one of my own
species would have seemed to me a raising me fiom death to.
life, and the greatest blessing that Heaven itself, next to tho
supreme blessing of salvation, could bestow; I say, that
should now tremble at the very apprehensionsof seeing a man,
and was ready to sink into the ground at but the shadow or
silent appearance of a man's havmg set his foot in the island.

Such is the uneven state of human life; and it afforded me
a great many curious speculations afterwards, when I had a
little recovered my first sur rise. I considered that this was
the station of life the infinite y wise and Ifined providence of
God had determined for me; that as I co d not foresee what
the ends of divine wisdom might be in all this, so I was not to
dis ute his sovereignty, who, as I was his creature, had an
un oubted right, by creation, to govern and dispose of me ab-
solutely as he thought fit; and w o, as I was a creature that
had offended him, had likewise a 'udicial right to condemn me
to what punishment he thought t; and that it was my part
to submit to bear his indignation, because I had sinned against
him. I then reflected, that as God, who was not on] r' hteous,
but omnipotent, had thought fit thus to Banish an let me,
so he was able to deliver me; that if he 1d not think fit to do
so, it was my unquestioned duty to resi myself abwutely
and entirely to his will; and, on the 0 er hand it was my
duty also to ho in him, pray to him, and quietly to attend
the dictates an directions of his daily provtdence.

These thoughts took me up many hours, days, nay, I may
say, weeks and months; and one particular efl'ect of my I-
tations on this occasion I cannot omit: One morning ear y,
1 mg in my bed, and filled With thoughtsabout my dangfir

rom the appearances of savages, I found It discomposed me
very much; upon which these words of the Scripture came
into my thoughts--" Call upon me In the day of trouble, and I
will deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify me." Upon this,
"5:5 cheerfully out of my bed, my heart was not only com-
for , but I was guided and encouraged to pray earnestly to
God for deliverance: when I had done prying, I took up my
Bible, and o ning it to read, the first wo s t at resented to
me were--"Wait on the Lord, and be of god c r and. he
shall. strengthen thy heart; wait, I say on t lord."se'lt Is Im-
possible toexpressthe comfort thugavenie. In answer, I
thankfully laid down the book. and was no more sad, at least,
on that occasion.

In the middle of these cogitations, a prehensions, and re-
flections, it came into my thoughts one ay, that all this might
be a mere chimera of my own, and that this foot might be the
print of my own foot, when I came on shore from my boat:
this cheered me up a little too, and I be an to persuade my-
self it was all a delusion; that it was notgin else but my own
foot: and why mightI not come that wa mm the boat, as
well as I was oing that way to the boat Again, I consid-
ered also, thatgl could by no means tell, for certain, where I
had trod, and where I had not; and that if, at last, this was
onl the print of m own foot, I had played the part of those
foo 5 who try to ma c stories of spectres and apparitions, and
then are frightened at them more than any body.

Now I began to take courage, and to pee abroad again, for
I had not stirred out of my castle for three a s and nights, so
that I began to starve for provisions; for I had, little or nothing
within doors but some barley-cakes and water: then I knew
that my oats wanted to be milked too, which usually was my
evening iversion; and the poor creatures were in great pain
and inconvenience for want of it; and, indeed, it almost spoiled
some of them, and almost dried u: their milk. Encouraging
myself, therefore, with the belief t at this was nothing but the
print of one of my own feet, and that I might be truly said to
start at my own 5 adow, I began to go abroad again, and went
to my country-housetomilk m flock: but to see with what
fear I went forward, how often looked behind me, how I was
ready, every now and then, to lay down my basket, and run
for my life, it would have made any one have thought I was
haunted with an evil conscience, or thatI had been lately most
terribly frightened; and so, indeed, I had. However, as I
went down thus two or three days, and having seen nothing, I
began to be a little bolder, and to think there was really noth-
ing in it but my own imagination: but 1 could not persuade
myself fully of this till I should go down to the shore again
and see this print of a foot, and measure it by my own, and
see if there was any similitude or fitness, that I mi ht be as-
sured it was my own foot: but when I came to the p ace, first
it appeared evidently to me, that when I laid up my boat, I could
not possibly be on shore any where thereabouts: secondly
when I came to measure the mark with in own that, I than

my foot not so large by a great deal. Bot these things filled
my_ head with new imaginations, and gave me the vapors
again to the highestdegree, so that I shook with cold like one
in an ague; and I went home again, filled with the belief that
some man or men had been on shore there; or, in short, that
the island was inhabited, and I might be surprised before I

was aware; and what course to take for my security I
knew not.

0, what ridiculous resolutions men take when possessed with
fear! It deprives them of the use of those means which reason
offers for their relief. The first thing I proposed to myself was
to throw down my inclosures, and turn all my tame cattle wild
into the woods, lest the enem should .find them, and then fre-
quent the island in pros ct o the same or the like booty ; then
to the simple thing of igging up my two cornfields, lest they
should find such a grain there, and still be prompted to fre-
quent the island ; then to demolish my bower and tent, that they
miwht not see any vestiges of habitation, and be prompted to
loo farther, in order to find out the persons inhabiting.

These were the subject of the first night's cogitations afier I
was come home again, while the apprehensions which had so
overrun my mind were fresh upon me, and my head was full
of vapors, as above. Thus fear of danger is ten thousand times
more terrif ing than danger itself, when apparent to the eyes;
and we find the burden o anxiety greater,_ much. than the
evil which we are anxious about: and, who was worse than
all this, I had not that relief in this trouble, from the res' anon
I used to practise, that I hoped to have. I looked, I_ ought,
like Saul, who complained not only that the Phihstines were
u n him, but that God had forsaken him; for I did not now

e due ways to compose my mind, by crying to God in my
distress, and resting upon his providence, as I had done boils,
for my defence and deliverance; which, if I had done, I had
at least been more cheerfully supported under this new sur-
prise, and, perhaps, carried through it with more resolution.

This con usion of my thoughts ke t me awake all night;
but in the morningl fell asleep; an havin , by the amuse-
,ment of my mind, been, as it were, tired an my spirits ex-
hausted, I slept very soundly, and wak much better com-
posed than I had ever been before. And now I began to think
sedately; and, upon the utmost debate with myselfil con-
cluded that this island, which was so exceedinc' pleasant,
fruitful, and no farther from the main land than as? had seen,
was not so entirely abandoned as I might imagine; that al-
thourrh there were no stated inhabitants who lived on the spot,
yet that there mi ht sometimes come boats off from the shore,
who either with esi rn, or perhaps never but when they were
driven by cross win s, mig it come to this place; that] had
lived here fifteen years now, and had not met with the least
shadow or ii ure of an ' people yet; and that if at any time
they should )e driven ere, it was robable they went away
again as soon as ever they could',' seeing they had never
thought lit to fix here upon any occasion; that the mest I
could suggest any dann'er from, was from any casual, acci-
dental landing of straggling people from the main, who, as it
was likely, if they were driven hither, were here against their
wills, so they made no stay here, but went off again with all
possible speed; seldom sta ing one mlrht on shore, lest they
should not have the help 0 the tides and daylight back again '
and that, therefiire,I had nothing to do but to consider of
slome safe retreat, in case I should see any savages land upon
t Ie s )ot.

Nolw I began sorely to repent that I had dug my cave so
large as to bringr a door through ain, which door, as I said,
came out beyond where my forti cation joined to the rock:
upon maturelv considering this, therefore, I resolved to draw
me a second thrtification, m the same manner of a semicircle,
at a distance from my wall, just where I had planted a double
row of trees about twelve years before, of which I made men-ROBTNSON 030803. [a

non: these trees having been planted so thick before, they
wanted but few piles to be driven between them, that they
might be thicker and stronger, and my wall would be soon
finished; so that I had now a double wall; and my outer wall
was thickened with iieces of timber, old cables, and every
thing I could think , to make it strong; having in it seven
little holes, about as big as I might put my arm out at. In the
inside of this,l thickened my wall to about ten feet thick,
with continually bringing earth out of my cave, and laying it
at the foot of the wall, and walking upon it; and throu h the
seven holes I contrived to plant the muskets, of which took
notice that I had got seven on shore out of the ship; these I
planted like my cannon, and tilted them into frames, that held
them like a carriage, so that I could lire all the seven guns in
two minutes' time: this wall I was many a weary month in
finishing, and yet never thought myselfsale till it was done

When this was done, I stuck all the ground without my
wall, for a great length every way, as full wnth stakes, or sticks,
of the osier-like wood, which I found so apt to row, as they
could well stand; insomuch that I believe I mig t set in near
twenty thousand of them, leavin_ a pretty large space between
them and my wall, that I mightfitave room to see an enemy,
and they might have no shelter from the young trees, if they
attempted to approach my outer wall. _

Thus, in two years' time, I had a thick grove-_ and in live
or six years' time I h' d a wood before my dwell": , grownng
somonstrous thick and strong, that it was rude perfectly
impassable; and no men of what kind soever would ever im-
agme that there was any thin" beyond it, much less a habita-
tion. As for the way which 1 proposed to.myself to 3:0 In
and out (for I left no avenue), It was by setting two l days,
one to a part of the rock which was low, and then broke in,
and left room to place another ladder upon that' so when the
two ladders were taken down, no man lm could come down
tome without doin himself mischief; an if they had come
down, they were ' l on the outside of my outer wall.

Thus I took alllsthe measures human prudence could-II.-
at for my own preservation; and it will be seen, at length

at they were not altogether without just reason; though I
foresaw nothing at that time more than my mere fear sug'
gested to me.

While this was doinnr, l was not altogether careless of' my
other affairs; for I had a great concern upon me for my little
herd of goats; they were not only a ready supply to me on
every occasion, and beam to be sufficient for me, without the
expense of powder and shot, but also without the fatigue of
hunting after the wild ones; and I was loath to lose the ad-
vantage of them, and to have them all to nurse up over again,

For this purpose, after long consideration, I could think of
but two ways to preserve them: one was, to find another
convenient place to dig a cave under ground, and to drive
them into it every night; and the other was, to inclose two or
three little bits of land, remote from one another, and as much
concealed as I could, where I might keep about half a dozen
young goats in each )lace; sothat if any disaster happened
to the flock in oral, I might be able to raise them again.
with little trouli e and time; and this, though it would require
3 great deal of time and labor, I thought was the most rational-

estgn.

Accordingly 1 (mt some time to find out the most retired
parts of the Islam ; and l pitched upon one, which was as

rivate, indeed, as m ' heart could wish for: it was a little,

am piece of gmun , in the middle of the hollow and thick
w s, where, as is observed, I almost lost myself once before
endeavoring to come back that way from the eastern part of:
the island. Here I Ibund a clmir piece of land, near three
acres, so surrounded with woods, that it was almost an inclo-
sure by nature; at least, it did not want near so much labor
hto rgake it so as the other pieces of ground I had worked so

ar at. .

I immediately went to work with this piece of ground, and
in less than a month's time I had so fenced it round, that my
flock, or herd,--call it which you please,---who were not so wild
now as at first they might be supposed to he, were well enough

it.
secured in it: so, without any further delay, I removed ten
young she-goats and two hegoats to this piece; and when
the were there, I continu to perfect the fence, till I
ha made it as secure as the other; which,_however, I did
at more leisure, and it took me up more time by a great
deal. All this labor I was at the expense of, purely from my
apprehensions on the account of the print of a man's foot which
I had seen; for, as yet,I never saw any human creature come
near the island; and I had now lived two years under this un-
easiness, which, indeed, made m life much less comfortable
than it was before, as may be we] imagined by any who know
what it is to live in the constant snare o the fear of man. And
this I must observe, with grief too, that the discomposure of
my mind had too great impressions also upon the religious '
part of my thoughts; for the dread and terror of falling into
the hands of sav s and cannibals lay so upon my spirits,
that I seldom foun myself in a due temper for application to
my Maker, at least not with the sedate calmness and resi na-~
tions of soul which I was wont to do: I rather prayed to 0d
as under great affliction and pressure of mind surrounded
with dan er, and in expectation every ni ht of being mur-
dered an devoured before morning; and must testi y from
my experience, that a temper of peace, thankfulness, love and
affection is much the more proper frame for raver than that
of terror and discomposure; and that under t e dread of mis-
chief impending, a man is no more lit for a comforting per-
formance of the duty of praying to God, than he is for a re-
pentance on a sick bed; for these discomposures afi'ect the
mind as the others do the body; and the discomposure of the
mind must necessarily be as great a disability as that pf the
body, and much greater; paying toGod being properly an
act of the mind, not of the y.

_ But to go on: after I had thus secured one art of my little
hung stock, I went about the whole islan , searchin for
snot er. private place to make such another de 't; w

u n the sea at a great distance. I had found a perspective.
g ass or two in one of the seamen's chests, which I saved out
of our shi , but I had it not about me : and this was so remote,
that I cou d not tell what to make of it, though I looked at it
till my e 'es were not able to hold to look any longer: whether
it was a at or not, I do not know, but as I descended from
the hill 1 could see no more of it; so I gave it over; only I re-- .
solved to o no more out without :1 pers ctive-glass in my
pocket. hen I was come down the hil to the end of the
island,-where, indeed, I had never been before, I was presently
convinced that the seeing the )rint of a man's foot was not
such a strange thing in the is and as I imagined; and, but
th'tt it was a special providence that I was cast u n the side
of the island where the savages never came,l s ould easily
have known that nothin r was more frequent than for the canoes
from the main, when t ey happened to be a little too far out
at sea, to shoot over to that side of the island for harbor; like-
wise, as they often met and fought in their canoes, the victors,
having taken any prisoners, would brin them over to this
shore, where, according to their dreadfu customs, being all
cannibals they would kill and eat them; of which hereafter.

When I was come down the hill to the shore, as I said
above, being the S. W. point of the island,l was perfectly con-
founded and amazed; nor is it possible for me to ex ress the
horror of my mind, at seeing the shore 5 read wit skulls,
hands, feet, and other bones of human ies; and particu-
larly,I observed a place where there had been a fire made,
and a circle dug in the earth, like a cock-pit, where I sup-
posed the sava e wretches had sat down to their inhuman
teastings upon t e bodies of their fellow-creatures.

I was so astonished with the sight of these things, that I en-
tertained no notions of any danger to myself from it for a lonrr
while: all my apprehensions were buried in the thoughts 0
such a pitch of inhuman, hellish brutality, and the horror of
the de eneracy of human nature, which, though I had heard
of it 0 en, yet I never had so near a view of before: in short,
I turned away my face from the horrid spectacle; my stomach
w sick, and I was 'ust at the point of faintinig when nature
ischarged the disor er from my stomach; an having vomit-
ed with uncommon violence, I was a little relieved, but could
not bear to stay in the place a moment; so I got me up the
hill again with all the speed I could, and walked on towards
to own habitation. '
hen I came a little out of that part of the island I stood
still awhile, as amazed, and then, recoverin myself, I looked
up with the utmost affection of my soul, an , with a flood of
tears in my eyes, gave God thanks, that had cast my first lot
in a art of the world where I was distinguished from such
drea ful creatures as these; and that, though I had esteemed,
my present condition ver ' miserable, had yet given mevso'g'
many comforts in it, that had still more to ive thanks figs?
than to com lain of ; and this, above all, that had, even in
this miserable condition, been comforted with the knowledge
of Himself, and the hope of His blessin r; which was a felicity
more than sufficiently equivalent to all ihe misery which I had
suffered, or could suffer.

In this frame of thankfulness, 1 went home to my castle, and
began to be much easier now, as to the safety of m circum-
stances, than ever I was before; for I observed t at these
wretches never came to this island in search of what they could
tglfit; perhaps not seeking, not wanting or not expecting, any

e? here; and having often, no doubt, been up II] the cov-
er , woody part of It, Without finding any thing to their pur-
pose. I knew I had been here now almost eighteen years, and
never saw the least footsteps of human creature there before;
and I might be ei hteen years more as entirely concealed as
I was now, if I di not discover' myself to them, which I had
no manner of occasion to do; it bein my onl business to
keep myself entirely concealed where was un ess I found a
better sort of creatures than cannibals to malte mvself known
to. Yet I entertained such an abhorrence of" the savage
wretches that I have been speaking of, and of the wretched,
mhuman custom of their devourin and eating one another up, 0
that I continued pensive and and kept close mthm my

{'4
O a
own circle, for almost two years afler this: when I say my
own circle, I mean by it my three plantations, viz. my castle,
my country-seat, which I called my bower, and my inclosure
in the woods : nor did I look after this for any other use than
as an inclosure for m roats; for the aversion which nature
gave me to these hel isi wretches was such, that I was as
tearful of seeing them as of seeing the devil himself. I did
not so much as go to look after my boat all this time, but be-
gan rather to think of making me another; for I could not
think of ever making any more attempts to brin the other
boat round the island to me, lest I should meet wit 1 some of
these creatures at sea; in which, if I had happened to have
fallen into their hands I knew what would have been my lot.
, Time, however, and the satisfaction I had that I was in no
danger of being discovered by these people, began to wear off
my uneasiness about them; and I began to live just in the
same com )osed manner as before; only with this difference,
that I use more caution, and kept my eyes more about me
than I did before, lest I should happen to be seen by any of
them; and articularly, I was more cautious of firing my gun,
lest any of t rem, being on the island, should happen to hear It.
It was therefore a very good providence to me that I had fur-
nished myself with a tame breed of goats, and that I had no
need to hunt any more about the woods, or shoot at them-
and if I did catch any of them after this, it was by traps and
snares, as I had done before; so that for two years after this,
I believe I never fired my gun once of, though I never went
out without it; and, wlnch was more. as I ad sayed three
pistols out of the ship, I always carried them out with me, or
at least two of them, sticking them in my at-skm belt. I
also t'nrbished up one of the great cutlasses t at I had out of
the ship, and made me a belt to ban it on also' so that I was
now a most formidable fellow to lop at, when I went abroad,
if you add to the former description of myself, the particular
of two istols, and a great broadsword hanging at my side in
' a belt, ut without a scabbard. . .
Things going on thus, as szhave said, for some time, 1nonmson (meson. I75

seemed, excepting these cautions, to be reduced to to former
calm, sedate way ol'liviug. All these things tended to s ow me,
more and more, how far my condition was from being miser-
able, compared to some others; nay, to many other partic-
ulars of life, which it mi rht have pleased God to have made my
lot. It put me upon re ecting how little re ining there would
be among mankind at any condition of lie, if people would
gather compare their condition with those that were worse, in
order to be thankful, than be always comparing them with
those which are better, to assist their murmurings and com-
plainlngs.

As, in my present condition there were not rcall y many things
which i wanted, so, indeed, i thought that the {rights I had
been in 'about these savage wretches, and the concern I'had
been in for my own preservation, had taken off the edge of my
invention for m ' own conveniences; and I had dropped a good
design, which had once bent my thoughts too much upon;
and that was, to try if I could not make some of m barley
into malt, and then try to brew myself some beer. his was
really a whimsical thought, and I reproved myself elten for
the simplicity of it; for I presently saw there would be the

' want of several thintrs necessary to the making my beer that
it would be. impossible for me to supply" as, first, cas s to
preserve it in, which was a thing that as i have observed al~
steady, I could never compass; no, trough I spent not only
'many days, but weeks, nay, months, in attempting it, but to
no purpose. In the next place, I had no hops to make it kee ),
no 'east to make it work, no copper or kettle to make it be: -

'it, when once I ha it in my heir to begin it. But my inven-
tion now ran quite another way ; for, night and da , i could

to take effect, unless I was to be there to o it myself; and
what could one man do among them, when perhaps there
might be twenty or thirty of them together, with their darts,
or their bows and arrows, with which they could shoot as true
to a mar-k as I could with my glut!"
Sometimes I thought of digging a hole under the place
where the made their fire, and putting in five or six.
,, unds o gunpowder, which, when they kindled their

near it; but as, in the first placer] should be unwilling to
waste so much powder upon them, my store being now within
the quantity of one barrel, so neither could I be sure of its
going off at any certain time, when it might sur )rise them;
and, at best, that it would do little more than just )low the fire
about their ears, and tiight them, but not sullicienttomake
them forsake the place: so I laid'it aside :. and then proposed.
that I would place myself in ambush in some convenient

and l was so full of it, that I otten dreamed of it, and some-
times that l' was just going to let fly at them. in. my sleep. I
went so far with it in my imagination, that I emplbyed' myself
several days to find out proper places to put myself in. ambus-
cade, as I said, to watch for them; and I went frequently to:
the place itself, which was now rown more familiar to me:
But while my mind was thus fill with thoughts of revenge,
and a bloody putting twenty or thirty of them to the sword, as
I may call it, tlwhorror I' had! at the place, and at the signalsof the barbarous wretches devouring one another, abetted my
malice. Well, at length,l found a place in the side of the
hill where I was satisfied 1 mi rht securely wait till I saw any
of their boats coming; and mig it then, even before they would
be ready to come on shore, conve myself, unseen, into some
thickets of trees, in one of whici there was a hollow large
enough to conceal me entirely; and there I mi ht sit and ob-
serve all their bloody doings, and take my fu aim at their
heads, when they were so close together as that it would be
next to impossible that I should miss my shot, or that I could
fail woundmcr three or four of them at the first shot. In this
place, thenj resolved to fix my design; and,-accordingl ' I "-11-
prepared two muskets and my ordinary fowlin -piece. 'i'he.
two muskets I loaded with a brace of slugs eac , and Tourer???"
five smaller bullets, about the size of pistol-bullets; and the'
fowling-piece I loaded with near a handful of swan-shot, of
the largest size: I also loaded my pistols with about four bul-
lets each; and in this osture, well provided with ammunition
forda second and third, charge, 1 prepared myself for my ex--

e mon. '
p After I had thus laid the scheme of my design, and, in my
imagination, put it in practice, I continually made my tour
every morning it to the top of the hill, which was from my
castle, asl calle it, about three miles, or more, to see il'I
could observe any boats upon the sea, coming near the island,
or standing over towards it; butI began to tire of this hard
duty, after I had, for two or three months, constantly kept my
watch, but came always back without any discovery; there
having not, in all that time been the least appearance, not
only on or near the shore, but on the whole ocean, so far as
my eyes or glasses could reach every way.

As long as! kept my daily tour to the hill to look out,'so
long also I he t up the vigor of my design, and my spirits
seemed to be a the while in a suitable form tor so outrageous
an execution as the killing twenty or thirty naked savages, for
an ofl'ence which I had not at all entered lnlp a discussion of
in my thoughts, any further them my pams were at first
fired by the horror I conceived at the unnatural custom of the
people of that country; who, it seems had been suffered by
'rovidence, in his wise disposition oi~ the world, to have no
other guide than that of their own abominable and vitiated
passions; and, consequently, were left, and perhaps had been
so for some ages, to act such horrid things, and receive such
dreadful customs, as nothing but nature entirely abandoned
by Heaven, and actuated by some hellish degeneracy, could
have run them into. But now, when, as I have said, I began
to be weary of the fruitless excursion which I had made so
long and so far every morning in vain, so my 0 inion of the
action itself began to alter; and I began, wit cooler and
calmer thoughts, to consider what I was 0mg to en age in;
what authority or call I had to pretend to judge an execu-
tioner upon these men as criminals, whom Heaven had thou ht
fit, for so many ages, to suffer, un unished, to go on, an to
he, as it were, the executioners or his judgments one upon
another. How far these people were offenders against me
and what right I had to enga e in the quarsel of that blood
which they shed promiscuou y upon one another, I debated
this very often with myself, thus: How do I know what God
himself j udges in this particular case? It is certain these peo-
ph: (in not commit this as a crime; it is not against their own
consciences reproving, or their light reproachmg them: they
do not know it to be an offence, and then commit it in defiance
of divine justice, as we do in almost all the sins we commit.
They think it no more a crime to kill a captive taken in war,
than we do to kill an ox; nor to eat human flesh, than we do to
Bill mutton. ,
When I considered this a little, it followed necessarily that
I was certainly in the wrong in it; that these eople were not
murderers in the sense that I had before con emned them in
my thoughts, any more than those Christians were murderers
who often put to death the prisoners taken in battle; or more
frequentl ', upon many occasions, put whole troops of men to
the sword, Without givin uarter, though they threw down
their arms and snbmittedg. n the next place, it occurred to
me, that although the usage they gave one another was thus
brutish and inhuman, yet It was really nothing to me: these
people had done me no injury: that if they attempted me, or

saw it necessary, for my immediate preservation, to fall upon
them, something might be said for it; but that I was yet out
of their power, and they really had no knowledge of me, and
consequently no design upon me, and therefore it could not
be just for me to fall upon them : that this would justify the
conduct of the S aniards in all their barbarities practised in
America, where they destroyed millions of these ple ; who
however they were Idolaters and barbarians, an had sever
bloody and barbarous rites in their customs, such as sacri-
ficing human bodies to their idols were yet, as to the Span-
iards, very innocent peo le; and t at the rooting them out of .
the country is spoken of with the utmost abhorrence and de-
testation by even the Spaniards themselves at this time and
by all other Christian nations in Europe, as a mere butchery,
a bloody and unnatural iece of cruelty, unjustifiable either to
God or man' and for w ich the very name of a S aniard is
reckoned tobe frightful and terrible to all people of umanity,
or of Christian compassion; as If the kingdom of Spain were
particularly eminent for the produce 0 a race of men who
were without principles of tenderness, or the common bowels
of pity to the miserable, which is reckoned to be a mark of
generous temper in the mind.

These considerations really- put me to a ause, and to a
kind of a full stop; and I beam, by little an little, to be 05
my deiifn, and to conclude had taken wrong measures in
my re ution to attack the sav s;--and that it was not my
business to meddle with them un ess they first attacked me;
and this it was my business, if possible to prevent; but that
tfl were discovered and attacked by t em I knew at duty.
On the other hand, I argued with myself, that this rea y was '
the we not to deliver myself, but entirely to ruin and destroy
mysel - for unless I was sure to kill ever one that not only
should 'be on shore at that time, but that uld ever come-op

country-people what had happened, they would come over
again by thousands to revenge the death of their fellows, and
I should onl ' bring upon myself a certain destruction, which,
at present, had no manner ofoccasion for. Upon the whole,
I concluded, that neither in principle nor in policy, I ought,
one way or other, to concern myself in this ati'air; that my
business was, by all' possible means, to conceal myself from
them, and not to leave the least signal to them to uess by that
there were any living creatures upon the islan ,I mean of
human sha e. Religion joined in with this prudential resolu-
tion; and was convinced now, many ways, that I was per-
fectly out of my duty when I was laying all my bloody schemes
for the destruction of innocent creatures, I mean innocent as to
me. As to the crimes they were guilty of towards one another
I had nothing to do with them; they were national, and I
ought to leave them to the justice of God, who is the governor
of nations, and knows how, by national punishments, to make
a just retribution for national 'offences, and to bring public
judgments upon those who offend in a public manner, by such
ways as best please him. This appeared so clear to me ow
that nothing was a greater satisfaction to me than that I ad
not been suffered to do a thing which I now saw so much
reason to believe would have been no less a sin than that of
wilful murder, if I had committed it; and I gave most hu ble
thanks on my knees to God, that had thus elivered me rom
blood-guiltiness; beseeching him to ant me the protection
of his providence, that I might not f 1 into the hands of the
barbarians, or that I might not lay my hands upon them un-
less I had a more clear call from Heaven to do it, in de ence
of my own life.

In this disposition] continued for near a ear after this;
and so far wasI from desiring an occasion or falling upon
these wretches, that in all that time I never once went u the
hill, to see whether there were any of them in sight, orto now
whether any of them had been on shore there or not, that I
might not be tempted to renew any of my contrivances against
them, or be provoked, by any advantage which might prennt
:tself, to fall u 'n them: only this I did, I went and removed
my boat, whic I had on the other side of the island, and car-
ried it down to the east end of the whole island, where I ran it
into a little cove, which I found under some high rocks, and
where I knew, by reason of the currents, the savages durst not,
at least would not come, with their boats, upon any account
whatever. With my boat] carried away every thing that I
had left there belonging to her, though not necessary for the
bare going thither, viz. a mast and sail which I had made for
her, and a thing like an anchor, but which, indeed, could not
be called either anchor or afirapnel ' however, it was the best I
could make of its kind : these I
not be the least shadow of any discovery, or any a pearance
of any boat, or of any human . habitation, upon island.
Besides this, I kept myself, as I said, more retired than ever,
and seldom went from my cell, other than upon my constant
employment, viz. to milk my she-goats, and man my little
flock in the wood, which, as it was quite on the ot er part of
the island, was quite out of danger; for certain it is, that these
savage people, who sometimes haunted this island, never came
with any thoughts of finding any thing here and consequently
never wandered of from the coast; and I doubt not but they
might have been several times on shore after my apprehensions
of them had made me cautious, as well as before. Indeed, I
looked back with some horror upon the thoughtsof what in con-
dition would have been if I had chopped upon them an been
discovered before that when, naked and unarmed, except with
one gun, and that loaded often ionly wnth small shot, I walked
every where, peeping andpeering about the island tosee what
I could get: what a sur use should I have been in, if, when I
discovered the print 0 a man's foot, I had, instead of that,
seen fifteen or twenty savages, and found them Ilipursuing me,
and by the swiftness of their running, no possib' ity of my es-
caping them! The thoughts of this sometimes sunk m very
soul Within me, and distressed my mind so much, that could
not soon recover it, to think what I should have done, and how
I shouldnot only have been unable to resist them, but!--

should not have had presence of mind enough todo what I
might have done; much less what now, after so much consid-
eration and preparation, I might be able to do. Indeed, after
serious thinking of these~ things, I would be very melancholv,
and sometimes it would last a great while; but I resolved it all,
at last, into thankfulness to that Providence which had deliv-
ered me from so many unseen dangers, and had kept from me
those mischiefs which I could have no way been the agent in
delivering myself from, because I had not the least notion of
any such thing dependinv, or the least supposition of its bein

possible. Tins rencwetr a contemplation wlnch often ha

come to my thoughts in former time, when first I began to see
the merci ul dis )ositions of Heaven, in the dangers we run
through in this ife; how wonderfully we are delivered when
we know nothing of it; how, when we are in a quandary
(as we call it), a doubt or hesitation, whether to go this way,
or that way, a secret hint shall direct us this way, when we
intended to "0 that way; nay, when sense, our own inclina-
tion, and peishaps business, has called to go the other way, yet
a strange Impression upon the mind, from we know not what
springs, and by we know not what power, shall overrule us
to go this way; and it shall afterwards appear, that had we
gone that way which we should have gone, and even to'our
imagination ought to have gone, we should have been mined
and lost. Upon these and many like reflections, I afterwards
made it a certain rule with me, that whenever I found
those secret hints or pressings of mind, to doing or not
doing any thinn- that presented, or going this wa 'or that
way, I never failed to o y the secret dictate; thoug I knew
no other reason for it than that such a pressure, or such a
hint, hung upon my mind. I could give many examples
of the success of this conduct in the course of my life, but
more es cially in the latter part_of my inhabiting this'un-
happy is and; besides many occastons which it is very like-
ly I might have taken notice of, if I had seen with the same
eyes then that I see with now._ But it is .never too late to be
wise; and I cannot but advnse all consrdenng men, whose
lives are attended with such extraordinary incidents as mine,
or even b not so extraordinary, not to slight such secret
intimations 0 Providence, let them come from what invisible
intelligence they will. That I shall not discuss, and perhaps
cannOt account for ; but certainly they are a proof of the con-
verse of spirits, and a secret communication between those
imbodied and those unimbodied, and such a proof as can
never be withstood; of which I shall have occasion to give
some ver remarkable instances in the remainder of my soli-
tar resi ence in this dismal place.

believe the reader of this will not think it strange if I con-
fess that these anxieties, these constant dangers I liv in, and
the concern that was now upon in, ut an end to all inven-
tion, and to all the contrivances that had laid for my future
accommodations and conveniences. I had the care of my
safet more now upon my hands than' that of my food. I
care not to drive a nail or chop a stick of wood now, for fear
the noise I might make should be heard; much less would 1
fire a gun, for the same reason; and, above all, I was intoler-
ably uneasy at making any fire, lest the smoke, which is visible
at a great distance in the day, should betray me. For this
reason I removed that part of my business which required lire,
such as burning of pots and pipes &c., into my new apart-
ment in the woods; where, after I had been some time, I
found, to my unspeakable consolation, a mere natural cave in
the earth, which went in a vast way, and where, I dare sa ',
no savage, had he been at the mouth of it, would be so ha y
as to venture in; nor, indeed, would any man else, but one
who like me, wanted nothing so much as a safe retreat.
The mouth of this hollow was at the bottom of a great rock,
where, by mere accident (I would say, if I did not see abun-
dant reason to ascribe all such things now to Providence),l
was cutting down some thick branches of trees to make char-
coal; and befbreciago on,I must observe the reason of my
making this char which was thus: I was afraid of makmv
a smoke about my habitation, as I said before; and ya! could
not live there without baking my bread, cooking my meat.
&c.; sol contrived to burn some wood here, as I had seen
done in England, under turf, till it became chark,or dry coal;
and then utting the fire out,I preserved the coal to carry
home, and) perform the other services for which fire was want-
ing, without danger of smoke. But this is by the by.----While
l was cutting down some wood here, I perceived that behind
a very thick branch of low brushwood, or underwood, there
was a kind of hollow place: I was curious to look in it. and,
getting with ditliculty into the mouth of it, I found it was
pretty large; that is to say, sutl'icient for me to stand upright
In it, and perhaps another with me; but I must confess to
you that I made more haste out than I did in, when, looking
farther into the place, antbwhich was perfectly (lark,I saw
two broad, shinitw eyes of some creature, whether devil or man
I knew not, whi I) twmkled like two stars; the dim light frotn
the cave's mouth shining directly in and making the reflec~
tion. However, after some pause, recovered myself, and
began to call myself a thousand fools, and to think, that he
m: was afraid to see the devil was not fit to live twenty years
in an island all alone; and that I mi ht well think there was
nothing in this cave that was more fri r ttful than myself. Upon
this, plucking up In ' courage I tool: up a firebrand and III I
rushed again, wrthtte stick flaming in my hand: I had not
gutlc three steps in, but I was almost as much frightened as I
was before; for I heard a very loud sigh, like that of a man in
some pain, and it was followed by a broken noise, as of words
halfexpressed, and then a deep sigh again. I stepped back,
and was indeed struck with such a surprise, that it ut me
into a cold sweat; and if I had had a hat on my hea 2.1 will
not answer for it, that my hair might not have lifted it 017'.
But still, plucking up my Spirits as well as I could, and en-
couraging myself a little with considering that the power and
presence of God was every where, and was able. to protect me,
upon this I stepped forward again, and by the light of the fire-
brand, holding it up a little over my head, I saw lying on the
ground a most monstrous, frightful _old h oat, just makin
's will, as we say, and gasping for life; an dying, mdeed.
mere old age. I stirred him a little, to see if I could get him
out and he essayed to get up but was not able to raise him-
self; and I thought with myself he might even he there; tbr
if he had frightened me, so he would certainly fright any of
the savages, if any one of them should be so hardy as to come
in there while he had an life in hint,

I was now recovered rouu my surprise, and began to look
round rue, when I found the cave was but very small, that is
to say, It might be about twelve feet over, but In no manner
of shape, neither round nor square, nohands having ever been
employed in making it but those of mere Nature. I observed
also that there was a place at the farther side of itjhat went
in further, but was so ow that it required are to cree'i upon
my hands and knees to 0 into it, and whither it wentl knew
not: so, having no can e, I gave it over for that time, but re-
solved to come again the next day, rovided with candles and
a tinder-box, which I had made of e lock of one of the runs-
kets, with some wild-fire in the pan. -

Accordingly, the next day I came provided with six large
candles of my own making (for I made very good candles now
of goats' tallow, but was hard set for candle-wick, using some-
times rags or to yarn, and sometimes the dried rind of a
weed like nettles ; and goinglinto this low place, I was obliged
to creeg uplon l fours, as have said, almost ten artls;
which, y t e wa , I thought was a venture bold enoug , con-
sidering that I knew not how far it might go, nor what was be-
yond it. When I had got through the strait, I found the roof
rose higher_u , I believe near twenty feet; but never was such
a glorious sl seen in the island, I dare say, as it was, to look
round the si es and roof of this vault or care: the wall reflect-
ed a hundred thousand lights to me from my two candles,

OJS creature to be seen, neither was there any damp or wet
on the sides or root': the only ditlicnlty in it was the entrance ,
which, however, as it was a place of security, and such a re-
treat as I wanted, I thought that was a convenience; so that I
was really rejoiced at the discovery, and resolved, without any
delay, to bring some of those things which I was most anxious
about to this place; particularly,I resolved to bring hither
my magazine of powder, and all my spare arms, vtz. two
liiwling-pieces (for I had three in all), and three muskets (for
of them I had eight in all); so I kept at my castle only five,
which stood ready mounted, like pieces of cannon, on my out-
most fence, and were ready also to take out upon any expe-
dition. Upon this occasion of removing my ammunition, I
hap tened to open the barrel of powder, which I took up out
of t te sea, and which had been wet; and I lbund that the
water had penetrated about three or four inches into the powder
on every sule, which, caking, and rowin hard, had preserved
the instde like a kernel in the shell; so t iat I had near sixty
pounds of very good powder in the centre of the cask: this
was a very agreeable discovery to me at that time; so I car-
ried all away thither, never keeping above two or three pounds
of powder with me in my castle, for fear of a surprise of any
kind : I also carried thither all the lead I had left for bullets.

l fancied myself now like one of the ancient giants, which
were said to live in caves and holes in the rocks, where none
could come at them; for I persuaded myself, while I was here,
that iffive hundred savages were to hunt me, they could never
find me out; or, if they did, the would not venture to attack
me here. The old goat, whom found expiring, died in the
mouth of the cave the next day after I made this discovery:
and I found it much easier to d: a great hole there, and throw
him in and cover him with earth, than to drag him out; so I
interred him there, to prevent offence to my nose.

I was now in the twenty-third year of my residence in this
island; and was so naturalized to the place, and the manner
of living, that could I have but enjoy _ the certainty that no
savaga would come to the place to disturb me, I could have
been content to have capitulated for spending the rest of my
time there, even tothe last moment, till I had laid medown
and died, like the old goat in the cave. I had also arrived to
some little diversions and amusements, which made the time
pass a great deal more pleasantly with me than it did before:
as, first, I had taught my Pol, as I noted before, tqspeak; and
he did it so familiarly, and talked so articulately and sin,
that it was very pleasant to me; for I believe no bir ever
spoke plainer; and he lived with me no less than six-and-
twenty years: how long he might have lived afterwards] know
not, though I know they have a notion in the Brazrls that they
live a hundred years. My dog was a very pleasant and lovin
companion to me for no less than sixteen years of my time, an
then died of mere old age. As {or my cats they multiplied, as
I have observed, to that degree, that I was obliged to shoot seve-
ral of them at first, to keep them from devouring me and all I
had; but, at length, when the two old ones I brought with me
were gone, and after some time continually driving them from
me, and letting them have no provision with me, they _all ran wild
into the woods, except two or three favorites, which I kept
tame, and whose young, when they had any I always drowlp
ed ; and these were part of my family. Besides these, I always
kept two or three household kids about me, whom I taught to
feed out of my hand; and I had two more parrots, which
talked pretty well, and would all call Robin Crusoe, but none
like my first; nor, indeed, did I take the pains with anyof
them that I had done with him. I had also several tame sea-
fowls, whose names I knew not, that I caught upon the
and cut their wings; and the little sakes which I had an_
before my castle wall being now grown up to a good thick
grove, these fowls all lived- among these low trees, and bred
there, which was very agreeable to me ' so that, as I said
above, I began to be very well contented with the life I led,
if I could have been secured from the dread of thesavages.

the evil which in itself we seek most to shun, and which, when
we are fallen into, is the most dreadful to us, is oftentimes the
very means or door of our deliverance, by which alone we
can be raised again from the affliction we are fallen into. 3
could ive many examples of this in the course of my unac-
counta le life; but in nothing was it more particularly re-
markable than in the circumstances of my last years of solitary
residence in this island.

It was now the month of December, as I said above, in my
twenty-third year; and this, being the southern solstice (for
winter I cannot call it), was the particular time of my harvest,
and required my being pretty much abroad in the fields; when

oing out pretty early in the morning, even before it was

orough dayli rht, I was surprised with seeing a light of some
fire upon the s ore, at a distance from me of about two miles,
towards the end of the island where I had observed some sav-
ages had been, as beibre, and not on the other side; but to
my great affliction, it was on my srde of the island.

I was indeed terribly surprised at the sight, and stopped
short within my grove, not aring to go out, lest I might be-
sur rised, and yet I had no more peace within, from t e a -
pre ensions I had that if these savages, in rambling over t 1e
island, should find my corn standing or cut, or any of my
works and improvements, they woul immediately conclude
that there were people in the place, and would then never give
over till they had and me out. In this extremity,I went
back directly to my castle, pulled up the ladder after me and
made all things without look as wild and natural as I can .

Then 1 pre ared myself within, puttin mvself in a posture
ofdefence: l oaded all my cannon, as called them, that is
to say, my muskets, which were mounted upon my new for-
tification, and all my pistols, and resolved to defend myself to
the last gasp; not. forgetting seriously to commend myself to
the divine rotection, and earnestly to praly to God' to deliver
me out of t e hands of the barbarians. continued in this

ture about two hours; and began to be mighty impatient
. r intelligence abroad, for I had no spies tosend out. Afie)

sitting awhile longer, and musing what I should do in this, I
was not able to bear sitting in ignorance an longer; so set-
ting up my ladder to the side of the hill, w ere there was a
flat place, as I observed before and then pulling the ladder u
after me, I set it up again, and mounted to the top of the hill:
and pulling out my perspective~glass, whichI had taken on
girpose, I laid me down flat on my belly on the ground, and
gan to look for the place. I presently found there were no
less than mne naked savages, sitting round a small fire they had
made, not to warm them, for they had no need of that, the
weather being extremely hot, but, as I supposed, to dress
some of their barbarous diet of human flesh, which the had
brought with them, whether alive or dead, I could not re .

The had two canoes with them, which they had hauled up
upon tie shore; and as it was then tide of ebb, they seemed
to me to wait for the return of the flood to go away again. It
is not easy to imagine what confusion this sight ut me into,
especially seeing them come on my side of the i and, and so
near me too; but when I considered their coming must be
always with the current of the ebb, I be an, afterwards, to be
more sedate in my mind, being satisfied t rat I might go abroad
with safety all the time of the tide of flood, if thev were not on
shore before ; and having made this observation, I went abroad
about my harvest-work with the more composure.

As I expected, so it proved; for as soon as the tide made to
the westward, I saw them all take boat, and row 1(or paddle,
as we call it away. I should have observed, that or an hour
or more be ore they went ofl'. they went a dancing; and I
could easily discern their postures and gestures by my glass.
I could not perceive, b my nicest observation, but that they
were stark naked, and ad not the least covering upon them;
but whether they were men or women, I could not distinguish.

As soon as I saw them shipped and gone, I took two guns
upon my shoulders, and two pistols in my girdle, and my great
sword by my side, without a scabbard and with all the speed
I was able to make, went awa to the hill where [ had discov-

which was not in less than two hours ( for I could not 0 apace
being so loaden with arms as I was), I perceived t ere had
been three canoes more of savages at that place; and looking ,
out farther, I saw they were all at sea together, makin over
lbr the main. This was a dreadful sight to me, especi ly as,
goinu' down to the shore, I could see the marks of horror,
which the dismal work they had been about had left behind it,
viz. the blood, the bones, and part of the flesh of human bodies

eaten and devoured by those wretches with merriment and
sport. I was so filled with indignation at the sight, that I now
began to remeditate the destruction of the next that I saw
there, let t rem be whom or how many soever. It seemed evi-
dent to me that the visits which the ' made thus to this island
were not very frequent, for it was a ve fifteen months before
any more of them came on shore there again; that is to say

I neither saw them, nor any footsteps or signals of them, in all
that time; for, as to the rainy seasons, then they are sure not
to come abroad, at least not so far; yet all this while I lived
uncomfortably, by reason of the constant apprehensions of
their coming upon me by surprise: from whence I observe,
that the expectation of evd is In re bitter than the sufi'ering,
especially if there is no room to s ake off that expectation, or
these apprehensions. _

During all this time I was in the murdering humor, and
took up most of my hours, which should have been better em-
ployed, in contriving how to circumvent and fall upon them,
the very next time I should see them,- especially if they should
be divided, as they were the last time, into two parties: nor
did I consider at all, that if I killed one party, suppose ten or
a dozen, I was still, the next dav, or week, or month, to kill
another, and so another, even ml t'rgfinftum, till I should be at
length no less a murderer than they were in being man-eaters,
and perhaps much more so. I spent my days now in great
get-p exitv and anxiety of mind, expecting that I should, one

ay or other, fall into the hands of these merciless creatures;
and if I did at any time venture abroad, it was not Without
looking round me with the greatest care and caution imagi-
nable. And now I found, to my great comfort, how happy it
was that] had provided a tame flock or herd of ts; for I
durst not, upon any account, lire my gun, especial y near that
side of the island where they usually came, lest I should alarm
the savages; and if they had fled from me now, I was sure to
have them come again, wrth perha s two or three hundred
canoes with them in a few days, an then I knew what to ex-
ect. However, Iwore out a year and three months more be-
ore I ever saw any more of the savages, and then I found them
again, as I shall soon observe. It is true, they might have
been there once or twice, but either they made no stay, or at
least I did not see them: but in the month of May, as near as
I could calculate, and in my four and twentieth year, I had a
very strange encounter with them; of which in its place.
The perturbation of my mind, during this fifteen or sixteen
months interval, was very great; I slept unquiet, dreamed
always frightful dreams, and often started out of my sleep in
the night: in the day great troubles overwhelmed my mind;
and in the night, I dreamed often of killing the savages, and
of the reasons whyl might justify the domg of it. But to
wave all this for a while.--It was in the middle of May, on the
sixteenth day, I think, as well as my poor wooden calendar
would reckon, for I marked all upon the post still; I say, it
was on the sixteenth of Mav that it blew a very _ rent storm of
wind all day, with a great deal of li htning an thunder, and
a very foul night it was after it. knew not what was the
particular occasion of it, but as I was reading in the Bible,
and taken up with very serious thoughts about my present
condition, I was surprised with the noise of a gun, as I
thought fired at sea. This was, to be sure, a surprise quite
of a difllerent nature from any I had met with before; for.the
notions this put into my thoughts were quite of another kind.
I started up in the greatest haste imaginable, and, in a truce
clapped my ladder to the middle place of the rock, and PS9ou
it after me; and mounting it the second timez'fot to top

the sea where l was driven down the current in my boat. I
immediately considered that this must be some ship in distress,
and that they had some comrade, or some other ship in com-
pany, and rim: these guns for signals of distress, and to obtain
ielp. l mu the presence of mind, at that Initiate, to think,
that tho-ugh 1 could not be] them, it might be they might
help me so t 'irought toget er all the dry wood I could get
at hand. and, making a good, handsome pile, I set it on hre
upon the In]. The wood was dry, and blazed freely; and
though the worn blew very hard, yet it burnt fairly out, so that

was certain. it there was any such thing as a ship, they must
needs see it and no doubt they did; for as soon as ever my
tire blazed up i heard another gun, and after that several
others, al: trom the same quarter. I plied my fire all night
long, till tlayhreax; and when it was broad day, and the air
cleared up I saw something at a great distance at sea, full
east of the island. whether a sail or a hull I could not distin-
guish, no, not two my glass; the distance was so great, and
the weather still. something hazy also; at least it was so out
at sea.

I looked implant! ' at it all that da , and soon perceived that
it did not Inm'e so l presently conc udcd that it was a ship at
anchor; and bent): eager, you may be sure, to be satisfied, 1
took my <<run .u on hand, and ran towards the south side of
the island, to the. rocks where I had formerly been carried
away with the current; and getting up there, the weather by
this time being perfectly clear, I could plainly see, to my great
sorrow, the wreck of a ship, cast away In the night upon those
concealed rocks which I found when I was out in my boat;
and which rocks, as they checked the violence of the stream,
and-made a kind of counter-stream, or eddy, were the occasion
of my recovering from the most desperate, hopeless condition
that ever 1 had been in, all my life. Thus, what is one man's
safety is another man's destruction; for it seems these men,
whoever they were, being out of their knowledge, and the
rocks being wholly under water, had been driven upon theme2

in the night, the wind blowing hard at E. N. E. Had they seen
the island, as] must neceSsarily suppose they did not, they
must, as I thought, have endeavored to have saved themselves
on sit-ire by the help of their boat; but their firing of guns for
help, especially when they saw, as I imagined, my tire, tilled
me with many thoughts: last, I imagined that upon seein my
light, they might have put themselves into their boat, am en-
deavored to make the shore: but that the sea going very hi b,
they might have been cast away: other times I imagined t at
they might have lost their boat before, as might be the case
many ways; as, particularly, by the breaking of the sea upm
their shi , which many times obliges men to stave, or take in
pieces, t ieir boat, and sometimes to throw it overboard with
their own hands: other times I imagined they had some other
ship or ships in company, who, upon the signals of distress
they had made, had taken them up and carried them oti';
other times I fancied they were all gone off to sea in their
boat, and being hurried away by the current that 1 had been
formerly in, were carried out into the great ocean, where there
was nothing but misery and perishing; and that perhaps,
they might by this time think of starvmg, and of hetng in a
condition to eat one another.

As all these were but conjectures at best, so, in the condi-
tion I was in, l could do no more than look on upon the misery.
of the poor men, and pity them; which had still this good
efi'ect on my side, that it gave me more and more cause to give
thanks to God, who had so happily and comfortabl pronded
for me in my desolate condition; and that of two 3 ips' com-
panies who were now cast away upon this part of the world,
not one life should be spared but mine. 1 horned here again
to observe, that it is very rare that the providence of God casts
us into any condition of lite so low, or any miser so great

but mere possibility indeed, for saw not the ast Sign or an:

desires l tclt in my soul- upon- this sirht, breakiig out some-o
times thus: " 0 that there had' been ut one or two, nay, or
but one soul, saved out of this shign, to have escaped to mejr
that I might but have had one companion, one fellow-creature

the time of my solitary file, I new-r felt so earnest, so-strong a:
desire after the society of my tbllow-ereatures,.or sodeep a,
re re! at the want of it.

here are. some secret moving springs in the affections,
which, when they are set a goil r by some object in- view, or",
though not in view, yet rendere present to the mind by the-
power of imagination, that motion carries out the soul,.l)y its
impetuosity, to such Violent, eager eurhracmgs of the ohjectr
that the absence of it is insupportahle. Such were these ear-
nest wishings that but one man ind been saved. I believe i
repeated the words, " 0tha: it had been but one! "' a thousand.
times; and my desires were so moved by it, that when I spoke
the words, my hands would clinch together, and my linger:-
would press the aims of my hands, so that if i had had any
soft thing in my and, it would have crushed it involuntarily:
and the teeth in my head would strike together,.and set against
one another so strong, that for some tune I could not part
them again. Let the naturalists ex ilain these'things, and the
reason and manner of them: all 'can say to them is to de-
scribe the fact, which was even- surprising to me', when i found
it, though I knew not from whence it proceeded : it was doubt-
less the efiect of ardent wishes, and of strong ideas formed in
my mind realizing the comfort which the conversation of one
of my feliow Christians would have been to me. But it was
not to be; either their fate or mine or both forbade it; for,
till the last year of my bein on this islan , I never knew
whether any were saved out that ship or no; and had only
the aflliction, some days after, to see the corpse of a drowned
boy come on shore at the end of the island which was next the
shipwreck. He had no clothes on but a seamen's waistcoat,
a pair of open-kneed linen drawers, and a blue linen shirt; but
nothin to direct me so much as to guess what nation he was
of: he ad nothin in his pockets but two pieces of eight and
a tobacco-pipe ;--t ie last was to me of ten times more value
than the first.

It was now calm, and I had a great mind to venture out in
my boat to this wreck, not doubting butI might find some-
thing on board that might be useful to me: but that did not
altogether press me so much as the possibility that there might
be yet some living creature on board, whose life I might not
only save, but might, by savin that life, comfort my own to
the last degree; and' this thoug t clung so to my heart, that I
could not be quiet night or day, but I must venture out in my
boat on board this wreck ;_ and committing the rest to God's
providence, I thought the impression was so strong upon my
mind that it could not be resisted, that it must come from some
invisible direction, and that I should be wanting to myself if I
did not go. .

Under the power of this impression, I hastened back to my
castle, prepared every thing for my voyage, took a quantity
of bread, a great pot of fresh water, a compass to stemby a
bottle of rum (for I had still a great deal of that left a
basket of raisins; and, thus loading myself with every thing
necessary, I went down to my boat, at the water out of her,
put her afloat, loaded all my cargo in er, and then went home
again for more. My second cargo was a at bageof rice, the -
umbrella to set up over my head for a sh ot rlarge pot
of fresh water, and about two dozen of my small loaves, or
barley-cakes, more than before, with a bottle of goat's milk
and a cheese; all which, with reat labor and sweat, Ivjearried
to my boat; and prayin .to ad to direct my vo I put

venture, or not to venture. I looked on the rapid currents
which ran constantly on both sides of the island at a distance,
and which were verv terrible to me, from the remembrance
ofthe hazard I had been in before, and my heart began to fail
me; for l foresaw that if I was driven into either of those cur-
rents, I should be carried a reat way out to sea, and perhaps
out of my reach, or si ht oft ie island again; and that then, as
my boat was but smlel, if any little gale of wind should rise, I
should be inevitably lost.

These thoughts so oppressed my mind, that I began to give
over my enterprise; and having hau'led my boat into ahttle
creek on the shore, I stepped out, and sat me down upon a
risin bit of ground, very pensive and anxious, between fear
and esire, about mv voyage; when, as] was musing, 1 could,
perceive that the tide was turned, and the flood come on; up-
on which my going was impracticable for so many hours.
Upon this presentlv it occurred to me, that I should go up to
the hi rhest piece of ground I could find, and observe, it Icould,
how t 9 sets of the tide, or currents, lay when the flood came
in, that I mightjudge whether, ifI was driven one way out, I
might not expect to be driven another way home, with the
same rapidness of the currents. This thought was no sooner
in my head than I cast my eye upon a little hill, which suffi-
ciently overlooked the sea both ways, and from whence I had
a clear view of the currents, or sets of the tide, and which way
I was to guide myself in my return. Here I found, that as
the current of the ebb set out close by the south point of the
island, so the current of the flood set in close by the shore of
the north side: and thatI had nothing to do but to keep to the
north Iside of the island in my return, and I should do well
enou .

Engcouraged with this observation, I resolved, the next morn--
ing, to set out with the first of the tide; and reposing myself
for the ni ht in my canoe, under the great watch-coat I men-
tioned, I aunched out. Itirst made a little out to sea full
norfli, till I began to feel the benefit of the current, which set
eastward, and which carried me at a great rate; and yet did
not so hurry me as the current on the south side had done be-
fore, so as to take from me all government of the boat; but
havin a strong steerage with my paddle, I went at a great
rate irectly for the wreck, and in less than two hours I came
up to it. It was a dismal sight to look at: the ship, which, by
its building, was Spanish, stuck fist, jammed in etween two.
rocks; all the stern and uarter of her were beaten to pieces
with the sea; and as her orecastlc, which stuck in the rocks,
had run on with reat violence, her maininast and foremast
Were brought by t board, that is to say, broken short off '
but her bowsprit was sound, and the head and bow appeared
firm. When I came close to her, a dog appeared upon her
who, seeing me coming, yelped and cried; and as soon as I
called him, jumped into the sea to come to me; I took him
into the boat, but found hiinralmost dead with hunger and
thirst. I gave him a cake of my bread, and he devoured it
like a ravenous wolf that had been starving a fortnight in the
snow; I then gave the r creature some fresh water, with
which, if I would have et him, he would have burst himself.
After this I went on board; but the first sight I met with was
two men drowned in the cook-room, or forecastle of the ship,
with their arms fast about one another. I concluded, as is in-
deed probable, that when the ship struck, it bein in a storm,
the sea broke so high, and so continually over r,thst the
men were .not able to bear it, and were stran led with the con-
stant rushingn of the water, as much as if they had been un-
der water: sides the do , there was nothing left in the ship
that had life; nor any g s, that I could see, but what were
spoiled by the water. There were some casks of liquor,
whether wine or brandy, I knew not, which; lay lower in the
hold, and winch, the water being ebbed out, I could see; but
they 'were too big to meddle with. I saw several chests, which
I believed belonged to some of the seamen; and I got two of
them into the boat, Without examining what was in them. Had
the stern of the ship been fixed and the forepart broken 011', I
am persuaded I might have made a good voyage; for, by wh. a

mad a great deal of wealth on board; and, ifl me guess from
she course she steered she must have been bound om Buenoc
Ayres, or the Rio de la Plato, in the south part of America,
beyond the Brazils,to the Havanna,in the Gulf of Mexico,
and so gerha s to Spain. She had, no doubt, a great treasure
an her, at no use, at that time, to any body; and what he-
came of her crew, I then knew not.

I found, besides these che a little cask full of liflior. of
about twemv gallons, which got into my boat wi much
dilliculty. There were several muskets in the cabin, and a
great powder-horn, wrth about four pounds of powder in it:
as for the muskets, .1 had no occasion for them, so I left them,
but took the powder-horn. I took a fine-shovel and tongs,
which I wanted extremely; as also two little brass kettles,
.2 copper pot to make chocolate, and a gridiron; and wrth
sthis cargo and the dog, I came away, t tide beginning
to make home again; and the same evening, about an
.hour withing-light, I reached the island agam,_weary and
.fatigued to the last degree. I reposed that night in the
boat; and in the morning I resolved to harbor what I had fist
in my new care, and not carry it home to my castle. A r
.refreshing myself, I got all my cargo on shore and began to
examine the articulars. The one of li uor I found to he a
kind'ol'rum. ut not such as we had at 318 Brazils, and, In a
word not at all good; but when I came to open the cheats, I
found several things of reat use to me: for example, I found
<<in one a fine case of hot es, of an extraordinary kind, and filled
with cordial waters, fine and very ood; the bottles held about
ahreeofints each, and were tip Wlth Silver. I found two
you very good succades, or sweetmeats, so fastened also on
.the top, that the salt water had not hunt them; and two more
.of the same, which .the water had spoiled. I found some very
good shirts, which were very welcome to are andjhout a
<<' ozen and a half of white linen handkerchnelzs and colored
meckcloths- the lbrmer were also very welcome, bemgfix-
iceedin re reshing to wipe my face in a hot day" Besides
shin, w Lcamejn'the till in the chest, I found that)?
great bags of pieces-of-e'ght, which held about eleven hundred
ieces in all; and in one of them, wrapped up in a paper, six.
oubloons of gold, and some small bars or wedges of gold; I
suppose they might all weigh near a pound. In the other:
chest were some clothes, but of little value; but by the cir-
cumshnces, it must have belonged to the gunner's mate;
though there was no powder in it, except two ads of fine-
glazed powder, in three small flasks, kept, suppese, for
charging their fowling-pieceson occasion. Upon the whole, I
got very little by this voyage that was of any use to me; for,
as bathe money,l had not manner of occasion for it; it was-
to me as the dirt under to feet; and I would have given it all
for three or four pair of glish shoes and stockings, which
were things I. greatly wanted, but had none on my feet for
litany years. l had indeed got two pair of shoes now,.whiclt:
I took off the feet of the two drowned men whoml saw in

I used to be looked out oftener, and did not go abroad so
much; and i at any time I did stir with any freedom, it was

out so many recautions, and such a load of arms an ammu--
nition as I r ways carried with me if I went the other way.
I lived in this condition near two years more; but my unlucky
head, that was always to let me know it was born to make m y
body miserable, was all theser two years filled with projects
and designs, how, if it were possible, I might get away from
this island; for sometimes I was for making another voyage

had had the boat that I went from Sallee in,I should have ven-
tured to sea, bound any where, I knew not whither. I have
been, in all my circumstances, a mmu-nto to those who are
touched with the eneral plague of mankind, whence, for
might I know, one ialfof their miseries flow: I mean that of
not being satisfied with the station wherein God and nature
hath placed them; for, not to look back upon my primitive
condition, and the excellent advice of my father, the 0 )position
to which was, as I ma ' call it, my original sin, m ' sn sequent
mistakes of the same 'ind had been the means 0 my comingr
into this miserable condition; for had that Providence, which
so bappil ' seated me at the Brazils as a planter, blessed me
with con ned desires, and I could have been contented to have
one on gradually,I might have been, by this time, I mean in
t te time of my bein in this island, one of the most consider-
able planters m the razils; nay,l am persuaded, that by the
improvements I had made in that little time I lived there, and
the increase I should probably have made, if I had remained
I might have been worth a hundred thousand m ' $5; an

them at our own door from those whose business it was to
fetch them? and though it had cost us something more, yet
the dilference of that nice was by no means worth saving at
so great a hazard. at as this is usually the fate of young
heads, so reflection upon the lolly of it is as commonly the ex-
ercise of more years, or of the dear-bought ex )erience of time '
so it was with me now ; and yet so deep had the mistake taken
root in my temper, that I could not satisfy myself in my sta-
tion, but was continually poring upon the means and possibil-
ity of my escape from this place; and that I may, with the
greater pleasure to the reader, bring on the remaining part
of my story, it may not be improper to give some account of
my first conceptions on the subject of this foolish scheme for
my escape, and how, and u on what foundation, I acted.

I am now to be suppose retired into my castle, after my
late voyzwc to the wreck, my frigate laid u') and secured under
water, as usual, and my condition restore to what it was be-
fore: I had more wealth, indeed, than I had before, but was
not at all the richer; for I had no more use for it than the
Indians of Peru had before the Spaniards came there.

It was one of the nights in the rainy season in March, the
four-and-twentieth year of my first setting foot in this island
of solitude, I was lying in my bed, or hammock, awake; very
well in health, had no pain, no distemper, no uneasiness of
bod ', nor any uneasiness of mind, more than ordinary, but
conId by no means close my eyes, that is, so as to sleep; no,
not a wmk all night long, otherwise than as follows :--It is im-
possible to set down the innumerable crowd of thoughts that
whirled through that great thoroughfare of the brain, the
memory, in this night's time. 1 ran over the whole history of
my life in miniature, or b ' abridvment, as I may call it, to my

in the sand; not that! did not believe the savages had he
quented the island even all the while, and might have been,
several hundreds ol'thum, at times on shore there; but I had
never known it, and was incapable of any apprehensions about
it: my satisfaction was perlcct, though my danger was the
same, and I was as happy in not knowing my danger as it" 1
had never really been exposed to it. l'his furnished my
thoughts with many very profitable reflections, and particu-
larly this one: How infinitely good that Providence is, which
has provided, in its government of mankind, such narrow
bounds to his sight and knowled re of things; and though
he walks in the midst of so many thousand dangers. the sight
of which, if discovered to him, would distract his mind and sink
his spirits he is kept serene and calm, by having the events
of things hid from his eyes, and knowing nothing of the dan-
gets which surround him.

After these thoughts had for some time entertained me,l
came to reflect seriously upon the real dan er I had been in
tin so many years in this very island, and low I had walked
about in the greatest security, and with all possible tranquil-
lity, even when perhaps nothm Y but the brow of a hill, at great
tree, or the casual a preach 0 night, had been between me
and the worst kind ol'] destruction, viz. that of falling into the
hands of cannibals and suvzwes, who would have seized on me
with the same view as I worild on a goat or a turtle, and have
thought it no more a crime to kill and devour me, than I did
of a igeon or curlew. I would unjustly slander myself, it!
should say I was not sincerely thankful to my great Preserver,
to whose singular ' roteetion I acknowledged, with rreat hu-
mility, all these un mown deliveranees were due, an without
which I must have inevitably fallen into their merciless hand s.

When these thoughts were over, my head was for so 0 time
taken up in considering the nature of these wretchedJiitures,
1 mean the savages, and how it came to pass in the w'bild, that
the wiseflovernor of all things should give up any of his crea-
tures to such inhumanity, nay, to somethin so much below
even brutality itself, as to devour its own Eind; but as this

ry-
ended in some (at that time) fruitless speculations, it occurred
to me to in uire, what part of the world these wretches lived in;
how far 0 the coast was, front whence they came; what they
ventured over so far from home for; what kind of boats they
had; and why I might not order myself and my business so,
tint I might be as able to go over thither as they were to
mine to me.
I never so much as troubled myself to consider what I
should do with myself when I went thither; what would be-
come of me, if I fell into the hands of the savages; or how I
should escape from them, if they attacked me; no, nor so
much as how it was possible for me to reach the coast, and
not be attacked by some or other of them, without any possi-
bilit of delivering to 'self; and if I should not fall into their
han s, what I should do for provision, or whither I should
bend my course: none of these thoughts, I say, so much as
came in my way; but my mind was wholly bent u n the no-
tion of my passing over in my boat to the main lan . I looked
upon my present condition as the most miserable that could
)ossibl y be; that I was not able to throw myself into any thing,
'but death, that could be called worse; and if I reached the
shore of the main, I might perhaps meet with relief, or I might
coast along, as I did on the African shore, till I came to some
.inhabited country, and where I might find some relief; and
after all, perhaps, I might fall in with some Chrtstian sin
that might take me in; and if the worst came to the worst,
could but die, which would put an end to all these miseries at
once. Pray note, all this was the fruit of a disturbed mind, an
impatient temper, made desperate, as it were, by the long con-
tinuance of my troubles, and the disap intments I had met
in the wreck I had been on board of an where I had been so
near ' ing what I so earnestly logged for, VIZ. somebody
to spe , and to learn some knowl ge from them of the
place w ere I was, and of the probable means of my deliver-
ance. I was agitated wholly by these thoughtsznll my calm
of mind, in my resignation to Providence, and waiting the
issue of the. dispositions of Heaven, seemed to be suspended.

at '
<<a
andI had, as it were, no ower to turn my thoughts to any
thing but to the project 0 a voyage to the main; which came
upon me with such force, and such an impetuosity of desire,
that it was not to be resisted.

When this had agitated my thoughts for two hours or more,
with such violence that it set my very blood into a ferment,
and my pulse beat asit'l had been in a fever, merely With
the extraordinary fervor of my mind about it, nature, as if I
had been fatigued and exhausted with the very thou ht of it,
threw me into a sound sleep. One would have t ought I
should have dreamed of it; but I did not, nor of any thing rela-
ting to it: but I dreamed that as I was goin out in the morn-
ing, as usual, from my castle, I saw upon tie shore two ca-
noes and eleven savages coming to land, and that they brought
with them another savage, whom they were going to kill, in
order to eat him; when, on a sudden, the savage that they
were going to kill jumped away, and ran for his life; and 1
thong it, in my sleep, that he came running into my little
thick grove before my fortification, to hide himself; and, that

' I, seeing him alone, and not erceiving that the others sought
him that way, showed mysellpto him, and smiling upon him,
encouraged him; that he kneeled down to me, seeming to
pra mete assist him; upon which I showed him my ladder,
ma e him go up, and carried him into my cave, and he be-
came my servant; and that as soon as I had got this man, I
said to myself " Nowl may certainly venture to the main
land; for this fellow will serve me as a pilot, and will tell me
what to do, and whither to go for provisrons, and whither not
to o for fear of bein devoured; what places to venture into,
an what to shun." waked with this thought; and was un-
der such inexpressible impressions of joy at the prospect of
to escape, in my dream, that the disappointments which I
fe t upon coming to myself, and finding that it wafino more
than a dream, were equally extravagant the other Way, and
threw me into a very great dejection of s irits.

Upon this however, I made this cone usion; that my only
way to go a at to attempt an escape was, if possible, to get206 aomxsox on was.

a savage into my possession; and, if possible, it should be
one of their prisoners whom they had condemned to be eaten,
and should brin hither to kill. But these thoughts still were
attended with this ditliculty, that it was impossible to effect
this without attacking a whole caravan of them, and killin-r
them all; and this was not only a very desperate attempt, an
might miscarry, but, on the other hand, I had greatly scrupled
the lawfulness of it to myself; and my heart trembled at the
thoughts of shedding so much blood, though it was for my de-
liverance. Ineed not repeat the arguments which occurred
to me against this, they being the same mentioned before; but
though had other reasons to oli'er now, viz. that those men
were enemies to my life, and would devour me if they could;
that it was self-preservation, in the highest degree, to deliver
myself from this death of a me, and was acting in my own de-
fence as much as if they were actually assaulting me, and the
like, I say, though these things argued for it, ye' the thoughts
of shedding human blood for my deliverance 3: very ter-
rible to me, and such as I could by no means" ncile my-
self to for a great while. However, at last, after many secret
disputes with myself, and after great perplexities about it (for
all these arguments, one way and another, strug led in my
head a long tune), the eager prevailing desire of de Iverance at
length mastered all the rest; and I resolved, if possible to t
one of those savages into my hands, cost what it would. Hy
next thing was to contrive how to do it, and this indeed was
very difficult to resolve on: but as I could pitch upon no
probable means for it, so I resolved to put myself upon the
watch, to see them when they came on shore, and leave the
rest to the event; taking such measures as the opportunity
shouul present, let what would be.

With these resolutions in my thoughts, I set myself upon
the swans often as ossible, and indeed so often, that I was
heartily tired of it; or it was above a year and a half that I
waited; and for great part of that time went out to the west
end, and to the south-west corner of the island almost every
day, to look for canoes, but none appeared. The was very

discouragm , and began to trouble me much ; tnough I cannot
say that it id in this case (as it had done some time before)
Wear oil' the edO'e of my desire to the thing; but the longer it
seemed to he ddlayed, the more eager I wax for it : in a word,
I was not at first so careful to shun the sight of these savage-s,
and avoid being seen by them, as I was now eager to be upon
them. Besidch fancied nn'self able to manage one, nay,
too or three savages, if I had them, so as to make them (en--
tirely slaves to me, to do whatever l should dirm't them, and
to prevent their being able at any time to do me any hurt. It
was a great while that l vl(::t>'t'(l myself with this all'air; but
nothing still prosentml: a l my hurries and schemes came to
nothing, for no savages came near me lhr a great while.
About a year am a half after I (entertained these notionfi
{and by long nursing had, as it worn, resolved them all into
nothing, for want of an occasion to put them into execution),
I was surprised, one morning early, with seeing no has than.
five canoes all on shore together on my side the island, and
the people who belonged to them all landed, and out of my
aight. l'ho number of them broke all my measures; for see-
ing so many, and knowing that they always came fonr or six,
or sometimes more, in a boat, l could not tell what to think of
it, or how to take my measures, to attack twenty or thirty
men single-hamled; so lay still in my castle, pOI'plCXCd and
discomforted: however, I put myscll'into all the same postures
for an attack that I had formerly provided, and was just ready
{hr action, il'any thing; hail presented. Having waited a good
while, listening to hear if they made any noise at length,
luring very im mtient, I set my guns at the foot of" my ladder,
and clamherod up to the top of the hill, h_\' my two stages, as
usual; standing so, however, that my head did not appear
above the hill, so that they could not perceive me by any
means. Here I observed, by the help of my perspective-glass,
that they were no less than thirty in number; that. they had
a fire kindled, and that they had meat dressed. [low they
had cooked it, I knew not, or what it was; but they were
all dancing. in I know not how many barbarous gestures and
figures, their own way, round the tire.

While I was thus looking on them, I perceived, by my per-
speutive, two miserable wretches dragged from the boats,
where, it seems, they were laid by, and were now hrouI'ht out
for the slaughter. I perceived one of them iuunediatdly fall,
being knocked down, I suppose, with a club or wooden sword,
--- for that was their way,--and two or three others were at work
immediately, cutting him open for their cookery, while the
other victim was left standing by himself, till they should be
re tdy for him. In tlnt very moment, this poor wreteh seeing
himself a little at liberty, and unbound, nature inspired him
with hopes of life, and he started away from them, and ran
with incredible swiftness alone; the sands, directly towards me:
I mean towards that part of the coast where my habitation
was. I was dreadfully frightened, I must acknowledge, when
I perceived him run my way, and es recially when, as I
thought, I saw him pursued by the whoe body : and now I
expected that part of my dream was coating to pass, and that
he would certainly take shelter in my grove: but I could not
depend, by any means, upon my dream for the rest of it, viz.
that the other savages Would not pursue him thither, and find
him there. However,I kept my station, and my spirits be-
g III to recover, when I found that there was not above three
men that followed him; and still more was I encouraged when
I found that he outstri ped them exceedingly in running,
and gained round of t em; so that if he could but hold it
tilw halal; an our, I saw easily he would fairly get away from
"ear .

There was between 'them and my castle the creek, which I
mentioned often in the first part of my story, where I landed
my cargoes out of the ship; and this I saw plainly he must
necessarily swim over, or the poor wretch would be taken
there: but when the savage escaping came thither, he made
nothin .of it, than h the tide was then up; but plun in in,
swam ugh in aiout thirty strokes, or thereabouts, an ed,"I so

and ran on with exceedin stren h and smltness. When the
three persons came to t e cree , [found that two of them
could swtm, but the third could not, and that, standin on the
other side, he looked at the others, but went no fartlier, and
soon alter wentsoflly back a ain; which, as it happened, was
very well for him In the en . I observed, that the two who
swam were yet more than twice as long swimming over the
creek as the fellow was that fled from them. It came now
very warmly upon my thoughts, and indeed irresistibly that
now was the .time to get me a servant, and perha 98MB-
pamon orasslstant, an thatI was called plainl by rovidence
to save this poor creature's life. I immedia y ran down the
ladders with all possible ex edition, fetched In two uns,--for
the were both at the foot 0 the ladders, as I o serv above,--
an getting u again, with the same haste, to the top of the
hill, crossc towards the sea, and having a very short cut,
and all down hill, placed myself in the w between the pur-
suers and the pursued hallooing aloud to in that fled, who,
lookin back, was at flrst, perhaps, as much frightened at me
as at t em: but I beckoned with m hand to him to come
back; and in the mean time, 1 slow y advanced towards the
two that followed- then rushing at once upon the foremost,
I knocked him down with the stock of my iece. I was
loath to fire, because I would not have the rest ar; thou h,
at that distance, it would not have been easili heard, an

ing out of sight of the smoke too they woul not have easily
known what to make of it. Having knocked this fellow
down, the other who pursued him stopped, as if he had been
frightened, and I advanced a ace towards him: but as I came
nearer, l perceived presen y he had a bow and arrow, and
was fitting it to shoot at me: so I was then necessitated to
shoot at him first, which I did, and killed him at the first shot.
The savage who fled but had stopped, though--he saw
both ' enemies fallen and killed, as he thought, yet was so
frightened with the fire and noise of my piece, that he stood
stock-still, and neither came inward nor went backward,

In,
{ hallooed again to him, and made signs to come forward,
which he easily understood, and came a little way; then
sto )[Iied again, and then a little farther, and stopped again;
an .could then perceive that he stood trembliiw, as ifhe had
been taken prisoner, and had just been to be killaed, as his two
enemies were. I beckoned to him again to come to me, and
gave him all the signs of encouragement that I could think
of; and he came nearer and nearer, kneeling down every ten
or twelve steps, in token of acknowledgment for saving his
life. I smiled at him, and looked ilcasantly, and beckoned to
him to come still nearer : at length he came close to me; and
then he kneeled down again, kissed the ground, and laid his
head upon the ground, and taking me b ' the foot, set my foot
upon his head: this, it seems, was in to on of swearing to be
my slave forever. I took him u ), and made much of him,
and encoura'red him all I could. IBut there was more work to
do yet; for f perceived the savage whom I knocked down was
not. killed, but stunned with the blow, and began to come to
himself: so I pointed to him, and showed him the savage, that
ho was not dead; upon this, he spoke some words to me, and
though I could not understand them, yet I thought they were
pleasant to hear; for they were the first sound of a man's
voice thatI had heard, my own excepted, for above twenty-five
years. But there was no time for such reflections now: the
savage who was knocked down recovered himself so far as to
sit up upon the ground, and I )erceived that my savage began
to be afraid; but when I sawt 111:, I presented my other piece
at the man, as in would shoot him; upon this my savage (for
so I call him now), made a motion to me to lend him my sword,
which hung naked in a belt by my side, which 1 did. He no
sooner had it, but he runs to his enemy, and, at one blow, cut
off his head so cleverly, no executioner in Germany could have
done it sooner or better; which I thought very strange for one
who, I had reason to believe, never saw a sword in his life
before, exce t their own wooden swords: however, it seems,
as I learne afterwards, they make their wooden swords so
sharp. so heavy, and the wood is so hard, that they will cut ofi'

"V
heads even with them, ay, and arms, and tha at one blow
too. \Vhen he had done this, he comes laugh to me, in
sign of triumph, and brou ht me the sword again, and with
abundance of gestures, wtich I did not understand, laid it
down, with the head of the savqe that he had killed, just
before me. But that which astonished him most, was to
know how Ikilled the other Indian so far olf: so, pointing
to him, he made signs to me to let him go to him ; so I bade
him go, as well as I could. When he came to him, he stood like
one amazed, looking at him, turning him first on one Side,
then on the other, looked at the wound the bullet had made,
which, it seems, was just in his breast, where it had made
a hole, and no great quantity of blood had followed; but he
had bled inwardly, tor he was quite dead. Ile took up
his bow and arroWs, and came back; so I turned to go
away, and beckoned him to follow me, inakiii signs to him
that more might come after them. Upon this, e made signs.
to me that he should bury them with sand, that they might
not be seen by.the rest, if they followed; and so I made signs
to him again to do so. He fell to work; and in an instant, he
had scraped a hole in the sand with his hands, big enough to.
bury the first in, and then drag I'ed him into it, and covered
him; and did so by the other so: I believe he had buried
them both in a quarter of an hour. Then calling him away, I
carried him, not to my castle, but uite away to my cave, on
the farther art of the island; so 1 did not let my dream come-
to pass in t - t part, viz. that he came into my grove for shel-
ter. Here I gave him bread and a bunch of raisms to eat, and
a draught of water, which I found he was indeed in great dis-
tress for, by his running; and having refreshed him, I made
SIFDS for him to ago and lie down to sleep, showii him to a
p ace where I h laid some rice-straw, and a blan et upon it,
which I used to sleep upon myself sometimes; so the poor crea-
ture lay dowu, and went to sleep.

_He was a comely handsome fellow, perfectly well made,
With straight, strong limbs, not too large, tall, and well shaped ;
and," I reckon, about twenty-six years of age. He had a
very good countenance, not a fierce and surly aspect, but
seemed to have something very manly in his face; and yet he
had all the sweetness and softness of an European in his conn-
tenanee too, especially when he smiled. His hair was long
and black, hot eurlvd like wool; his forehead very high and
large; and a great vivaeity and sparkling sharpness in his
eyes. The color ol~ his skin was not quite black, but very
tawny ; and yet not an ugly, yellow, nauseous tawny, as the
Brazslians and Virginians, and other natives of America are,
but of a bright kind ol' a dun olive color, that had in it some-
thing very agreeable, though not very easy to describe. His
face was round and )lump; his nose small, not flat like the
Negroes; a very good mouth, thin ups, and his line teeth well
set, and as white as ivory.

Alter he 'had slumbered, rather than slept, about half an
hour, he awoke again, and came out of the cave to me, for 1
had been milking my goats, which 1 had in the inclosure just
by: when he espied me, he came runnin r to me, laying him-
self down awain upon the ground, with al the posstble signs
of an humh e, thankful disposition, making a great many antic
gestures to show it. At last, he lays his .head flat upon the
ground, close to my foot, and sets my other foot upon his head,
as he had done before; and after this, made all the signs to me
of subjection, servitude, and submission, imaginable, to let me
know how he would serve me so long as he lived. I under-
stood him in many things, and let him know I was very well
pleased with him. In a little time I began to speak to him,
and teach him to speak to me; and, first, I let him know his
name should he FRIDAY, which was the day I saved his life; i
called him so for the memory of the time. I likewise taught
him to say Master; and then let him know that was to he my
name 2 I likewise taught him to say Yes and No, and to know
the meaninfi' of them. I gave him some milk in an earthen
pot, and letbhim see me drmlt it before him, and sop invhread
m it' and gave him a cake of bread to do the like, wlneh he

mckly complied with, and made signs that it was very good
or him. I kept there with him all that night; but as soon as
it was day, I beckoned to him to come with me, and let him
know I would give him some clothes; at which he seemed very~
glad, for he was stark naked. As we went by the place where
he had buried the two men, he pointed exactly to the place,
and showed me the marks that he had made to find them ain,
making si ns to me that we should dig them up again, an eat
them. A this I appeared very angry, expressed my abhor-
nence of it, made as if I would vomit at the thoughts of it, and
beckoned with my hand to him to come away; which he did
immediately, with great submission. I then led him up to the
top of the ill to see if his enemies were gone; and pulling
out my glass, I looked, and saw lainly the place where they
had been, but no appear cc of em or their canoes; so that
it was plain they were go e, and had lefi their two comrades
behind them, Without any search after them.

But I was not content with this discovery; but havin now
more courage, and consequently more curiosity, I too In
man Friday with me, givin him the sword in his hand, wi
the bow and arrows at his ack, which I found he could use
very dextrousl , making him carry one gun for me, and I
two for mysel ; and away we marched to the place where
these creatures had been; for I had a mind now to t some
fuller intelligence of them. When 1 came to the p ace, my
very blood ran chill in my veins, and my heart sunk wrthin
me, at-the horror of the spectacle; indeed, it was a dreadful
sight at least it was so to me, though Fridagomade nothing of
it. he place was covered with uman nes, the ground
dyed with their blood, and great pieces of flesh left here and
there, half-eaten, mangled, and scorched; and, in short, all
the tokens of the triumphant feast they had been making
there, after a victory over their enemies. I saw three skulls
five hands, and the bones of three or four le s and feet, and
abundance of other parts of the bodies: and Pride , by his
signs, made me understand that they brought over, our pris- . '9
oners to feast upon; that three of them were eithn up, and ,
that be, pointing to himself, was the fourth; thatbthere-had f,
been a great battle between them and their next king", who-9' '3 4' '

subject, it seems, he had been one of, and that they had taken
a great number of prisoners; all which were carried to several
Places by those who had taken them in the light, in order to
east upon them as was done here by these \vretehes upon
those they broutrht hither.

I caused Friday to gather all the skulls, bones, flesh, and
whatever remained, and lay them together in a hear, and
make a great fire u on it, and burn them all to ashes. lit,
fouud'Friday had stillpa hunkerin stomach after some of the:
flesh, and was still a cannibal in his nature, but I discovered
so much abhorrence at the very thoughts of it, and at the least
appearance of it, that he durst not discover it; for I had,
by some means, let him know, that I would kill him if he
offered it.

When he had done this, we came back to our castle; and
there I fell to work for my man F rid ty; and, first of all,I
gave him a pair of linen drawers, which I hard out of the poor
gunner's chest I mentioned, which I found in the wreck and
which, with a little alteration, fitted him very well; and then 1
made him a. jerkin of goat's-skin, as well as my skill would
allow (for I was now grown a tolerable good tailor); nnd'l
gave him a co. , which I made of here's skin, very convenient
and fitshionahl}; enough; and thus he was clothed for the pres-
ent, tolerably well, and was mighty well pleased to see himself
almost as well clothed us his master. It is true, he went awk-
wardly in these clothes at first; wenrin the drawers was very
awkward to him, and the sleeves of tie waistcoat galled his
shoulders, and the inside of his arms; but a little easmg them
where he complained they hurt him, and using himself to
them, he took to them at length very well.

The next da after I came home to my hutch with him, I
began to consi or where I should led e him; and that I might
do well for him, and yet be perfect y easy myself, I made a
little tent'forhim in the vacant place between my two fortifi-
cations-,lmithe inside of the last and m the outside of the first.
As there was a door or entrance there into my cave, I made .a.
formal framed door-case, and a door to it of boards, and set it
up in the passage, a little within the entrance; and, causing
the door to 0' en in the inside,l barred it up in the night,
taking in my adders too; so that Frida ' could no way come
at me in the inside of my innermost w , without making so
much noise in getting over that it must needs waken me; for
my first wall had now a complete roof over it of 10in poles,
covering all my tent, and leaning in to the side of t e in";
which was again laid across with sma ler sticks, Instead of laths,
and then thatched over a great thickness with the rice-straw,
which was strong, like reeds; and at the hole or place which
was left to go in or out by the ladder, I had placed a klnd of
trap--door, which, if it had been attem ited on the outstde,
would not have opened at all, but would ave fallen down, and
made a great notse: as to weapons, I took them all into my
side every night. But I needed none ofall this precaution; for
never man had a more faithful, loving, sincere servant, than
Friday was to me; without passions, sullenncss, or designs,
perfectly obliged and enga ed; his very atfections were tied
to me like those of a chll to a father; and I dare say, he
would have sacrificed his life for the saving mine, upon any
occasion whatsoever: the many testimonies he gave me of this
put it out of doubt, and soon convinced me t at I needed to
use no precautions, as to my safety on his account.

This frequently gave me occasion to observe, and that with
wonder, that, however it had pleased God, in his providence,
and in the government of the works of his hands, to take from
so great a part of the world of his creatures the best uses to
which their faculties and the powers of their souls are adapted,
yet that he has bestowed upon them the same powers, the
samereason, the same affections, the same sentiments of kind-
ness and obligation, the same passions and resentments of
wrongs, the same sense of gratitude, sincerity, fidelity, and all
the capacities of doing ood, and receiviu good, that he has
given to us; and that w en he pleases to 0 er them occasions
of exerting these, they are as read , nay, more ready, to apply
them to the right uses for which t ey were bestowed, than we~

are. This made me very melancholy sometimes, in reflectinr'm"x.

as the several occasions presented how mean a use we make.
of all these, even though we have these powers enlightened by
the great lamp of instruction, the Spirit of God, and by the
knowledge of his word added to our understanding; and why
it has pleased God to hide the like saving knowledge limit so
many millions of souls, who, if i might judge by this poor
savage, would make a much better use of it than we did.
From hence, I sometimes was led too far, to invade the sove-
reignty of Providence, and as it were arraign the justice of so
arbitrary adis osition of things, that should hide that light
from some, an reveal it to others, and 'et expect a like dut '
from both; but I shut it up, and chec ed my thou hts wit
this conclusion: first, That we did not know by w at light
and law these should be condemned; but that as God was no-
cessarily, and by the nature of his being, infinitely holy and
just, so it could not be, but if these creatures were all sen--
tonced to absence from himself, it was on account of sinning
against that light which, as the Scripture says, was a law to
themselves, and hy such rules as their consciences would ao-
knowledge to be just, thmmh the foundation was not discov-
ered to us; and, secondly, il'hat still, as we all are the clav in
the hand of the potter, no vessel could say to him, " Why hast
thou formed me thus? "

But to return to my new com mnion:----I was greatly dc.
lighted with him, and made it my usiness to teach him ever
thing that was proper to make him useful, handy, and helpfu ;
but especiall ' to make him speak, and understand me when I
spoke: and e was the aptest scholar that ever was; and par-
ticularly was so merry, so constantly diligent, and so pleased
when he could but understand me, or make me understand
him, that it was very pleasant to me to talk tohim. Now, my life
began to be so easy that I began to say to myself, that could
I but have been sa e from more savages, I cared not if I was
never to remove from the place where I lived.

Alter l hadbeen two or three days returned to my castle, I

shook, and looked so amazedfilmt-I tlmught he would have:
sunk down. He did not see the kid 1 shot at, or )erceive L
had killed it, but ripped up his waistcoat, to feelw ether hr?
was not wounded; and, as ,I found presently, thought 1 WIN-
resolved to kill him; for he came and lmeelevl (loWn to um,
and embracing mv knees,.said- a great in'my things l (lid nob
understand ;. but 1 could easily see the meaning was, to pray
me not to kill him.

I soon found a way to convince him that l. would do him an
harm; and taking him up by the hand, laughed at him, and.
pointing to the kid which I had killed, beckoned to him to run
and fetch it, which he did-: and while he was wondering, and
looking to see how the creature was killed, I loaded my gun
again. By and by, 1 saw a great fowl, like a hawk, sitting;
upon a tree, within shot; so, to let Friday understand a
little what Iwould do,.I called him to me again, minted at the
lbwl, which was indeed a parrot, though I thoug it it had' been
a hawk; I say, pointing to the parrot, and to my gun, and to
the round under the parrot, to let him see I would make it
fullfi made him understand that i would shoot and kill the:
bird; accordingly I fired and bade him look, and immediately
he saw the arrot fall. He stood_like one frightened again,
noththsta in? all I had said to him; and I ibund he was the
more amazed, iecause he did not see me put any thing: into
the gun, but thought that there must be some wonderful fund
of death and destruction in that thing, able to kill man, beastmg,
bird, or any thing near or far elf; and the astonishment this .-

xaonmsm (Wilson. 219

created in him was such as could not wear off for a long time;
and I helieve, ifl would have let him, he would have wor-
shipped me and my gun. As for the gun itself, he Would not
so much as touch it, tor several days after; hnt he would speak
to it, and talk to it, as if it had answered him, when he was hy
himself; which, as I afterwards learned of him, was to de>n~e
it not to kill him. Well, after his astonishnumt was a little
over at this, I pointed to him to run and fetch the hird I had
shot, which he did, hut. staid some time; for the parrot, not
being quite dead, had thittereil away a good distance from the
place where she fell : however, he thnnd her, took her up, aml
nought her to me; and as I had perceived his ignoraueo
about the gun before, I took this advantage to charge the gun
again, and not to let him see me do it, that [might he ready for
any other mark that might present; hut nothing more offered at
that time; so l hrou'rht home the kid, and the same evening l.
took the skin off, and out it. out as well as I could; and having
a pot lit for that purpose, I hoiled or stewed some ofthe flesh,
and made some very good broth. After 1 had begun to eat
some. l {rave some to my man, who seemed very glad of it,
and like( it very well; but that. which was strangest to him,
\' ' to see me eat salt with it. He made a sign to me that the salt
.' not good to eat; and putting a little into his own month,
he seemed to nanseate it, and would spit and sputter at it,
washing his mouth with fresh water after it: on the other
hand,l took some meat into my month without salt, and l
)retended to spit and Splitter for want ofsalt, as fast as he had
ilone at the salt : but it would not do; he would never care for
salt with his meat or in his broth; at least, not for a great
while, and then hat: a very little.

Having thus fed him with hailed meat. and hroth, I was re-
solved to feast him the next day with roasting a piece of the
kid; this I did, by hanging it before the tire on a String, as I
Had seen many peopie do in England, setting txm poles up
one on each side of the lire, and. one across on the top, and
tying the string to the cross stick, letting the meat turn con-
tinually. This Friday admired very much; but when he
came to taste the flesh, he took so many ways to tell me how
well he liked it, thatI could not but understand him; and at
last he told me, as well as he could, he would never eat man's
flesh any more, which I was very glad to hear.

The next day, I set him to work to beating some corn out,
and sifting it in the mannerI used to do, 1151 observed before;
and he soon understood how to do it as well as I, especially
after he had seen what the meaning of it was, and that it was
to make bread of; for after that! let him see me make my
bread, and bake it too; and in a little time Friday was able to
do all the work for me, as well as I could do it myself.

I began now to wnsidcr, that having two months to feed in-

stead of one, I must provide more ground for my harvest, and
plant a larger 'quantity of corn than I used to do; so 1 marked
out a larger piece of land, and began the fence in the same
manner as before, in which Friday worked not only very will-
ingly and very hard, but did it very cheerfully: and i told
him what it was for; that it was for corn to make more hreid,
because he was now with me, and that I might have enough
for him and myself too. Me a ipeared very sensible of that
)art, and let me know that he tronght I had much more la-
mr upon me on his account than 1 had lbr myself; and that
he (\ivould work the harder for me, if I would tell him what
to o.

This was the pleasantest year of all the life 1 led in this
place: Friday began to talk pretty well, and understand the
names of almost every thingr I had occaston to call for and of
every place I had to send him to, and talked a great deal tome;
so that, in short, I began now to have some use for my ton ue
again, which, indeed,I had very little occasion for before, t rat
is to say, about speech. Besides the )leasure of talking to
him;I had a singular satisfaction in the fellow himself: his
simple unfeigned honesty a Jpeared to me more and more
every day, and I began real y to love the creature; and, on
his side,I .w'-ove he loved me more than it was possible for
him ever to am: any thing before. ._

I had a mind once to try if he had any hankering inclination

r

p
to his own country again; and having taught him English so
well that he could answer me almost any (ntestiott,l asked
him whether the nation that he belonged to never conquered
in battle ? At which he :elllllf'tl, and said, " Yes, yes, we al-
ways light the hotter; " that is, he meant, always get the hot-
tcr in fight; and so we began the thllowittg discourse :--

Mllst'rr. You alwavs light the better; how came you to be
taken prisoner, then, Ffltlity 'I

Friday. My nation heat much for all that.

Mastrr. Ilow beat I 11' your nation beat them, how came
you to be taken '1

Friday. They more many than my nation in the place
where me was; they take one, two, three, and me: my nation
overheat them in the yonder place, where me no was: there
my nation take one, two great thousand.

illrlstrr. But why did not your side recover you from the
hands of your enemies, then '1

Friday. They run one, two, three, and me, and make go
in the canoe; my nation have no canoe that time.

lllltstrr. Well, Friday, and what does your nation do with
the men they take? Do they carry them away and eat them,
as these did?

Friday. Yes, my nation eat mans too ; eat all up.

Master. Where do they carry them?

Friday. Go to other place, where they think.

Mastrr. Do they come hither?

Ii'ridrty. Yes, yes, they come hither; come other else
place.

flies-t". Have vou been here with them?

Bidet}. Yes, I have been here (points to the N. W. side
oftho island, which, it seems, was their sideg.

By this I under-shied that my man Friday tad formerly hecn
among the savages who used to come on shore on the farther
part of the island, on the same luau--eating,r occasions he was.
now brought for; and, some time after, when I took the cour-
age to carry him to that side, being the same I formerly men- '
trotted, he presently knew the place, and told me he was there
once when they ate u twenty men, two women, and one
child : he could not tcli'twenty in English, but he numbered
them, by laying so many stones in a row, and pointing to me
to tell them over.

I have told this passage, because it introduces what follows;
that after I had this discourse with him, I asked him how far
it was from our island to the shore, and whether the canoes
were not often lost. He told me there was no danger, nc
canoes ever lost; but that, after a little way out to sea, there
was a 'current and wind, always one way in the morning, the
other in the afternoon. This I understood to be no more than
the sets of the tide, as going out or coming in; but I after-
wards understood it was occasioned by the greatdraft and reflux
of the Ini rhty river Oroonoko, in the mouth or gulf of which
river, as ibund aiterwards, our island lay; and that this land
which I erceived to the W. and N. W. was the great island
Trinidad: on the north point of the mouth of the river. I asked
Friday a thousand questions about the country, the inhab-
itants, the sea, the coast, and what nations were near: he told
me all he knew, with the greatest openness imaginable. I
asked him the names of the several nations of his sort of people
but could get no other name than Caribs: from whence
easily understood, that these were the Caribbees, which our
maps place on the part of America which reaches from the
mouth of the river Oroonoko toGuiana, and onwards to St.
Martha. He told me that up a great way beyond the moon,
that was, beyond the settin ot' the moon, which must be west
from their country, there welt white-bearded men, like me,
and pointed to m great whiskers, which I mentioned before;
and that they ha lulled much mans that was his word); b
all which I understood, he meant the aniards, whose crue -
ties in America had been spread over the whole country, and
were remembered by all the nations from father to son.

I inquired if he could tell me howI mifiht go from this island
and get among those white men: he to] me, " Yes, yes, you
may 0 in two canoe." 1 could not understand what he meant,
or m e him describeto me what he meant by two can;

 
    

*\
sill, at last, with great difficulty, I found he meant it must be
in a large boat, as big as two canoes. This part of Frida 's
discourse began to relish with me very well; and from txis
time 1 entertained some hopes that, one time or other, 1 might
find an opportunity to make my escape from this place, and
that this poor savage might be a means to help me.

Durinv the lon'br time that Friday had now been with me,
and thatbhe began to speak to me, and understand me, I was
not wanting to-lay a foundation of religious knowledge in his
mind: particularly 1 asked him, one time, who made him.
The oor creature did not understand me at all, but thought
I h' asked him who was his father: but 1 took it up by
another handle, and asked him who made the sea, the ground
we walked on, and the hills and woods? He told me, it was
one old Bonamuckee, that ii. 9d beyond all; he could describe
lellug of this great person, but that he was very old, much
older, he said, than the son or the land, than the moon or the
:'s'LIF-'L I asked him, then, if this old person had made all things,
zx-hv did. not all things worship him. He looked very grave,
and with a erfect look of innocence said, " All things say 0
to him." asked him if the people who die in his country
u-ent away any where. He said yes; they all went to
Bunnmuckee: then I asked him whether these they eat up
went thither too. He said, yes.

From these thin SI began to instruct him in the knowled e of
ache true God _: [to (1 him that the great Maker of all things ived
up there ( rotating up towards heaven) ; that he governed the
world by t to same power and rovidence by which he made
it; that he was omnipotent, and could do every thing for us,
; ive every thing to us, take every thing from as; and thus,

3' degrees, I opened his eyes. He listened with great atten--
v-tion, and received with pleasure the notion of Jesus Christ
being sent to redeem us, and of the manner of making our
fiayers to God, and his being able to hear us, even in heaven.
' e told me one day, that if our God could hear us up be and
fihe sun, he must needs be a greater God than their na-
muckee. wholivec! but a little way 011', and yet could not hear
till they went u to the great moumains, where hedweit, to
speak to him. asked him if ever he went thither to speak to
him. He said, No; they never went that were young men;
none went thither but the old men, whom he called their
Oowakee; that is, as I made him explain it to me, their
religious, or clergy; and that they went to say 0 (so he
called saying prayers), and then came back and told them
what Benamuckee said. By this I observed, that there is
priestcral't even amon r the most blinded, ignorant pagans in
the world; and the pgicy of making a secretof religion, in
order to preserve the veneration of the people to the clerg , Is
not only to be found in the Roman, but perhaps among re-
ligions in the world, even among the most brutish and bar-
barous savages.

l endeavored to clear up this fraud to my man- Friday; and
told him, that the iretence of their old men going up to the-
mountains to say to their god Benamuckee was a cheat;
and their bringil ' word from thence what he said was much-
more so; that if t y met with any answer,or s ake with any
one there, it must be with an evil spirit: andt n I entered-
into a long discourse with him about the devil, theorig'inal of
him, his rebellion against God, his enmity to man, the reason
of' it, his setting himself up in the dark parts of the world to
be worship red instead of God, and as God, and the many
stratagems madeuseof to delnde mankind to their ruin;
how he had' a secret access to our passions and to our affec-
tions, and to adapt his snares to our inclinations, so as to
cause us even to beeur own tempters, and run upon our de-
struction by our own choice. .

I found It was not so easy to imprint right notions in his
mind about the devil, as it was about the being of a God: na-
ture assisted all my arguments to evidence to him even the
necessity of a great First Cause, and overruling, governin
Power, a secret,.directing Providence, and of the equity an '
fistice of ' paying homage to him that made us, and the like;

tthere appeared nothing of this k_md in the of aliens
spun; of his origmal,hts being,.his nature, and, above alL.

of his inclination to do evil, and to draw us in to do so too;
and the poor creature puzzled me once in such a manner, by
aqnestion merely natural and innocent, that l searee knew
what to say to him. I had been talking a great deal to him of
the power of God, his omnipotence, his aversion to sin, his
being a consuming the to the workers ot'inii uity; how, as he
had made us ali, he could destroy us and all the world in a
moment; and he listened with great seriousness to me all the
while. After this, 1 had been telling him how the devil
was God's enemy in the hearts of men, and used all his malice
and skill to deleat the good designs of Providence, and to
ruin the kiutrdom of Christ in the world, and the like.
" Well," sayslihiday, " but you say God is so strong, so great;
is he not much strong, much might as the devil l"---~" Yes,
yes," says I, " Friday, God is stronger than the devil : God is
above the det'ii; and therefore we pray to (ind to tread him
down under our tom, and enable us to resist his temptations,
and quench his her)! darts."--" But," says he again, " if God
much stronger, much might as the devil, why God no kill the
devil, so make him no more do wicked !" I was strangely
surprised at this question ; and, after all, though I was now an
old man. yetl was but a young doctor, and ill qualified for a
casuist, or a solver of difficulties; and, at first, 1 could not tell
what to say; so 1 pretended not to hear him, and asked him
what he said; but he was too earnest lbr an answer, to tbrget his
question, so that he repeated it in the very same broken words
as above. By this time I had recovered myself a little, and 1
said, " God will at last punish him severely ; he is reserved thr
thejudgmcnt, and is to be cast into the hottonileSs pit,to dwell
with everhtsting fire." This did not satisfy Friday; but he
returns upon me, repeating my words, " Res-<<run at last! me
no understand: but why not kill the devil now; not kill great
ago?"---" You may as well ask me," said I, " why God does
not kill you and me, when we do wicked things here that otlenrl
him: we are preserved to re unit and be pardoned." He
mused some time on this: " all well." says he, mighty af-
tiecttonately, "that well: so 3131, f, devil, all wicked, all pro-
serve, repent, God ardon all." Here I was run down ain
by him to the last egree; and it was a testimou to me, ow
the mere notions of nature, though they will gui e reasonable
creatures to the knowledwe ot' a God, and of a worship or hom-
age due to the supreme being of God, as the consequence of
our nature, yet nothing but divine revelation can form the
knowledge of Jesus Christ, and of redemption purchased for
us, of a Klediator of the new covenant, and of an Intercessor
at the footstool of God's throne; I say, nothing but a revelation
from Heaven can form these in the soul; and that therefore,
the Gos ml of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, 1 mean the
Word 0 God, and the Spirit of God, promised for the guide
and sanctilier of his people, are the absolutely necessary in~
struetors of the souls of men in the saving knowledge of God,
and the means of salvation.

I therefore diverted the present discourse between me and
my lnan, rising up hastily, as upon seine sudden occasion of
going out; then sendirw him for somethin r a good way 011', I
seriously irayed to God. that he would ena le me to instruct
savingly t tis poor savage; assisting, by his Spirit, the heart
of the poor ignorant creature to receive the light of the knowl~
edge 0 God in Christ, reconciling him to himself, and would
guide me to speak so to him from the word of God, as his con-
science might be convinced, his eyes opened, and his soul
saved. When he came again to me, I entered into a long dis-
course with him upon the subject of the redemption of man by
the Savior of the world, and of the doctrine of the Gospel
preached from heaven, viz. of re ntance towards God, and

aith in our blessed Lord Jesus. then explained to hnn, as

well as I could, why our blessed Redeemer took not on him
the nature of an els, but the seed of Abraham; and how, for
that reason, the fidlen an els had no share in the redemption;
that]? came only to the lost sheep of the house of lsrael, and
t e l e.

I had, God knows, more sincerity than knowledge in all the
methods I took for this . r creature's instruction, and must
acknowledge, whatI eve all that act upon the same prin-
ciple will find, that, in layin things open to him, I reall in-
formed and instructed rm'sc f in many things that either did
not know, or had not fully considered before, but which oc-
curred naturally to my mind upon searching into them, for
the information of this poor savage; and I had more affection
in my inquiry alter things upon this occasion than ever I felt
before; so that, whether this poor wild wretch was the better
for me or no, I had great reason to be thankful that ever he
came to me; my grief sat lighter upon me' my habitation
grew comfortable to me beyond measure; and when I reflect-
ed, that in this solitary life which I had been confined to, I had
not only been moved to look up to heaven myself, and to seek
to the hand that had brou ht me here, but was now to be
made an instrument, under firovidence, to save the life, and for
aught I knew, the soul of a poor savage, and bring him to the
true knowledge of religion, and of the Christian doctrine, that
he might know Christ Jesus, in whom is his eternal; I say,
when reflected upon all these things, a secret joy ran through
ever part of my soul and I freqirentl rejoiced that ever I
was rought to this place, which ha so often thought the
all" dreadful of all afflictions that could possibly have be-
en me.

I continued in this thankful frame all the remainder of my
time; and the conversation which em loyed the hours between
Friday and me was such as made three years which we
lived there together perfectly and com letely happy, if any
such thing as complete happiness can formedun a cabin-
nary state. This savage was now a good Christian, a much
better than I; though have reason to hope, and bleasGod

for it, that we were equall penitent and comforwd, restored

penitents. We had here t re word of God to read and no fat-
ther off from his Spirit to instruct, than if we had been in
En'rland. I always applied myself, in reading the Scriptures
to et him know, as well as I could, the meaning of whatI

read; and he again his serious inquiries and questionings,

private reading. Another thing I cannot refrain from observ-
mg here also, trom experience II) this retired part of my life,
viz. how infinite and inexpressible a blessing it is that the
knowledge of God, and of the doctrine cf salvation by Christ
Jesus, is so plainly laid down in the word of God, so easy to
be received and understood, that as the bare readin the
Scripture made me capable of understanding enough 0 my
duty to carry me directly on to the reat work of sincere re<<
pentance for my sins, and laying hol of a Savior for life and
salvation, to a stated reformation in practice, and obedience to
all God's commands, and this without any teacher or instruct.
or, I mean human; so the same plain instruction sufficiently
served to the enliwhtening this savage creature, and brin ing
him to be such a a'hristian, as I have known few equal to im
in my life.

As to all the disputes, wranglinw, strife, and contention,
which have happened in the world: about religion, whether
niceties in doctrines, or schemes of church government, they
were all perfectly useless to us and, for aught I can yet see,
they have been so to the rest of the world. We had the sure

uide to heaven, viz. the word of God; and we had, blessed be

od, comfortable views of the Spirit of God teachin and in~
structing us by his word, leading us into all truth, an makin
us both willing and obedient to the instruction of his wor .
And I cannot see the least use that the greatest knowledge of
the diSputed points of religion, which have made such confu-
sions in the world, would have been to us, if we could have ob-
tained it.---But I must go on with the historical part of things,
and take every part in its order.

After Friday and I became more intimately acquainted, and
that he could understand almost all I said to him, and speak

retty fluently, though in broken English, to me, I acquainted
liim with my own history, or at least so much of It as related to
my coming to this place ; how I had lived here, and how long: I
let him into the mystery, for such It was to him, of gunpowder
and bullet, and tau ht him how to shoot. I gave him a knife,
which he was won erfully delighted With; and I made him a
belt, with a fr hanging to it, such as in England we wear
han ers In; an in the f , instead of a hanger, I gave him a
hate et, which was not 0 y as good a weapon, in some cases,
but much more useful upon other occasions.

I described to him the country of Eurgge, particularly
England, which I came from; how we liv , how we wor-
shigped God, how we behaved to one another, and how we
tra ed in ships to all arts of the world. I gave him an account
of the'wreck which had been on board of, and showed him, as
near as I could, the (place where she la ; but she was all beaten
In pieces before, an gone. I showed im the ruins of our boat,
which we lost when we escaped, and which I could not stir
with my whole strength then; but was now fallen almost all
to pieces. Upon seeing this boat, Friday stood musing a
great while, and said nothin . I asked him what it was he
studied upon. At last, says fie, " Me see such boat like come
to place at my nation." 1 did not understand him a ood
while; but, at last, when I had examined farther into it, un-
derstood by him, that a boat, such as that had been, came on
shore upon the country where he lived; that is, as he ex-
plained it, was driven thither by stress of weather. I pres-
ently imagined that some Euro an ship must have been cast
away u it their coast, and e boat might get loose, and
drive as ore; but was so dull, that! never once thou ht of
men making their escape from a wreck thither, muc less
whence they might come: so I only inquired utter a descrip-
tion of the boat.

Friday described the boat to me well enough; but brought
me better to understand him when he a ded with some
warmth, " We save the white mans from drown): Then I
presently asked him, if there were any white mans (as he
called them) in the boat. "Yes," he said- "the boat full
of white mans}: I asked him how many. he told u n his _
fingers seventeen. I asked him then what became 0 them.
He told me, " They live, they dwell at my nation." .

This 32'" new thoughts into my 'head ; {or I>> presently rm- 5,.
agined atthesemig tbethemen belongingtotheshiptbat
was cast away in the sight of my island (as I now called it) ;
and who, after the ship was struck on the rock, and they saw
her inevitably lost, had saved themselves in their boat and
were landed upon that wild shore among the sava es. Upon
this,I inquired of him more criticall what was come of
them; he assured me they lived still. there; that they had
been there about four years; that the sav es let them alone,
and gave them victuals to live on. 1 "1:25 him how it came
to pass they did not kill them, and eat them. He said, " No,
they make brother with them; " that is, as I understood him,
a truce; and then he added, "They no eat mans but when
make the war fight ; " that is to say, they never eat any men
but such as come to fight with them, and are taken in battle.
It was after this some considerable time, that being upon
the top of the hill, at the east side of the island, from whence,
us I have said, I had, in a clear day, discovered the main or
continent of America, Friday, the weather being very serene
looks very earnestly towards the main land, and, in a kin
of surprise, falls a jumping and dancing, and calls out to me--
for I was at some distance from him. I asked him what was
the matter. " 0 joy! " says he; " O glad! there see my
country, there my nation ! " I observed an extraordinar '
sense of pleasure appeared in his face, and his eyes sparkled,
and his countenance discovered a strange caverness, as if he
had a mind to be in his own country again. 'I'his observation
of mine put a great many thoughts into me, which made me
at first not so easy about my new man Friday as I was before;
and I made no doubt but that, if Friday could get back to his
own nation again, he would not only forget all his reli ion, but
all his obligation to me, and would be forward enoug to give
his countrymen an account of me, and come back perhaps
with a hundred or two of them, and make a feast u n me, at
which he might be as merry as he used to be with t ose of his
enemies, when they were taken in war. But I wronged the
poor honest creature very much for which I was very sorry
afterwards. However, as my jealousy increased, and held me
some weeks, I was a little more circumspect, and not so
familiar and kind tohim as before; in which I was certainly in
the wrong too; the honest, rateful creature, having no
thought about it, but what consrsted with the best principles,
both as a religious Christian, and as a grateful friend; as ap-
peared afterwards, to my full satisfaction.

While my jealousy of him lasted, you may be sure I was
every day pumping him, to see if he would discover am' of the
new thoughts which I suspected were in him; but I found
every thing he said was so honest and so innocent, that I could
find nothing to nourish my suspicion; and, in spite of all my
uneasiness, he made me at last entirely his own again; nor
did he, in the least, )ereeive that I was uneasy, and therefore
I could not sus ect rim of deceit,

One day, wa king up the same hill, but the weather being
hazy at sea, so that we could not see the continent, 1 called to
him, and said, " Friday, do not you wish yourself in your own

there?" said I ; " would you turn wild again, out men's flesh
again, and be a'sava e, as you were before?" He looked full

them to live good; tell them to pray God; tell them to eat

at that, and then said, " No, no; they no kill me, they Willing

learn. He added "They learn much of the bearded mans
that came in the limt." Then Iasknd him if he would go
back to them. He smiled at that and told me that he could'not
swim so far. I told him, I would make a canoe for him. 'He

told me he would 0, if I would go with him. " I go l " says'

were to seventeen white men, or bearded men, as he called
them, who came on shore there in distress.

From this time, I confess I had a mind to venture over, ana
see if I could possibly join with those bearded men, who, I
made no doubt, were Spaniards and I'ortun'uese; not doubting
but if I could, we might find some method to escape li'on'
thence, being u on the continent, and a good company to
ga-ther, better t an I could from an island forty miles ofi
the shore, and alone, without help. So, after some days,l
I--Juk Friday to work again by wa ' of discourse; and told hint
I would give him a boat to go bac to his own nation; and ac~
mrdingly I carried him to my frigate, which lay on the other
side ol'tlte island, and having cleared it of water (for I always
kept it sunk in water), l brought it out, showed it hint, and
we both went into it. I found he was a most dextrous lellow
at managing it, and would make it ro almost as swift again as
I could. So when he was in, l sai to him, " Well, now, Fri-
day, shall we go to your nation '? " He looked very dull at my
s tying so; which, it seems, was because he thought the boat
too small to go so far: I then told him I had a bigger; so the
next day I went to the place where the first boat lay which I
lnd made, but which I could not get into the water. He said
that was bi enough; but then, as I had taken no care of it,
and it had ain two or three and twenty years there, the sun
h id sosplit and dried it, that it was in a manner rotten. Friday
told me such a boat would do very well, and would carry
"llll:!lCll enough vittle, drink, bread:" that was his way of
t: 'in r.

Updii the whole, 1 was by this time so fixed upon at ' de-
sign of {going over with him to the continent, that l tol him
we wou d go and make one as big as that, and he should go
home in it. He answered not one word, but looked very grave
and sad. I asked him what was the matter with him. He
asked me again, " Why you an ry mad with Friday? what
me done 'I" . I asked him what e meant; I told him I was
not angry With him at all. " No angry! " says he, repeating
thewords several times; " why send Frida home away to my
natton?"--" Why," says I, " Friday, d' not on say you
wrshed you were there'!"---" Yes, yes," says e, "Wish be
both there; no wish Friday there, no master there." In a
word, he would not think of goin there without me. "I go
there, Friday !': says I, " what all I do there?" He re-
turned very quick upon me at this: "You do great deal
much g ," says he; " you teach wild mans be good, sober,
tame mans; you tell them know God, pray God, and live new
life."--" Alas! Friday," says I, " thou knowest not what thou
sayest; I am but an ignorant man mysell'."--" Yes, yes,"
safvs he, " vou teachee me good, you teachee them good."--
*' e, no, Frida ," says I, " you shall go without me; leave
me here to live y myself; as I did before" He looked con-
fused again at that word; and running to one of the hatchets
which he used to wear, he takes it up hastily, and gives it to
me. "What must I do with this?" says I to him. " You
take kill Friday," says he. " What must I kill you for? " .said
lagsin. He returns ver quick, " What you send Friday
away for 'l Take kill Fri a , no send Friday away." This he
Spoke so earnestly, that I saw tears stand in lus eyes:_ In a
word, I so ainly discovered the utmost afiecuon In him to
me, and a rm resolution in him, that I told him then, and
often after, that I would never send him away from me, if he

was willing to stay with me.
Upon the whole, as I found, by all his discourse, a settled

affection to me, and that nothing should part him_ from me, so
I found all the foundation of his desire to go to his own coun~
tr was laid in his ardent affection to the pee e, and his hopes
my doin them good; a thin , which, as; had. no notion of
myself, so had not the least t dght, or Intention, or desire
of undertaking it. But still I fans a strong inclination to my
attemptinzoan esca , as above, founded on the supposition
athered m the iscourse, me. that there were seventeen
arded men there; and, therefore, without any more delay,

I went to work with Friday, to find out a grammes proper to
fell, and make a large perragua, or canoe, to undertake the

voya c. There were trees enough in the Bland to have built
a line fleet, not of periaguas, or canoes, but even of good
large vessels; but the main thing I looked at was, to get one
so near the water that we might launch it when it was made,
to avoid the mistake I committed at first. At last, Friday
pitched u )0" a tree; for I found he knew much better than I
what kin of wood was fittest for it; nor can] tell, to this day,
what wood to call the tree we cut down, except that It was
very like the tree we call fustic, or between that and the Ni-
caragua wood, for it was lunch of the same color and smell.
Friday was for burning the hollow or cavity of this tree out,
to make it for a boat, but] showed him how to cut it with
tools, which, after 1 had showed him how to use, he did very
handily; and in about a month's hard labor we finished it, and
made it very handsome; especially when, with our axes,
which I showed him how to handle, we cut and hewed the
outside into the true shape of a boat. Alicr this, however, it
cost us near a fortnight's time to I'et her along, as it were inch
by inch, upon great rollers into t ie water; but when she was
in, she would have carried twenty men with reat ease.

When she was in the water, and though s to was so big, it
amazed me to see with what dexterity, and how swift my man
Friday would manage her, turn her, and Middle her along.
So l asked him if he would, and if we mig it venture over in
her. "Yes," he said,~." we venture over in her very \'ell,
thouwh great blow wind." However, I had a further destrn
that he knew nothing of, and that was to make a mast and5 a
sail, and to (it her with an anchor and cable. As to a mast,
that was easy enough to et: so I pitched upon a straight
young cedar tree, which found near the place, and which
there were great plenty of in the island; and I set Friday to
work to cut it down, and gave him directions how to shape and
order it. But as to the sail, that was my particular care. I
knew I had old sails, or rather pieces of old sails enough ' but
as l had had them now six-and-twenty years by me, and had
not been very careful to reserve them, not imagining that I
should ever have this kind) of use for them, I did not doubt but
they were all rotten, and, indeed most of them were so. How-
ever, I found two pieces, which ap ared pretty good, and
with these I went to work; and wtt a great deal of pains,
and awkward stitchin , you may be sure, for want of needles,
I, at length, made a t ree~cornered, ugly thing, like what we
call in England a shoulder-of-mutton sail, to go with a boom
at bottom, and a little short sprit at the top such as usually
our ships' long-boats sail with, and such as I best knew how
to manage, as it was such a one I had to the boat in which I
made my escape from Barbary, as related in the first part of
'my story.

1 was near two months performing this last work viz. rig-
ging and fitting my mast and sails; for I finished them very
complete, makm a small stay, and a sail, or fore-sail, to it, to
assist, if we shou d turn to windward; and, which was more
than all, I fixed a rudder to the stern of her to steer with. I
was but a bunging shipwright, yet, as I knew the usefulness,
and even necessity of such a thI , I applied myself with so
much pains to do it, that at last I rought it to pass; though,
considering the many dull contrivances I had for it that failed,
I think it cost me almost as much labor as making the boat.

After all this was done, I had my man Friday to teach as to
what belonged to the navigation of my boat; for, though he
knew very well how to paddle a canoe, he knew nothing what-
belon d to a sail and a rudder; and was the most amazed
when e saw me work the boat to and fiain in the sea by the
ruddes, and how the sail fiibbed, and led this way, or that
way, as the course we as ed changed; I say, when he saw'
this, he stood like one astonished and amazed. However, with
a little use, I made all these things familiar to him, and he be-
came an expert sailor, exce t that as to the compass, I could
make him understand ver ittle 0 that. On the other hand,
as there was very little c oudy weather, and seldom or never
any fogs in those parts, there was the less occasion for a com-'
pass, seein the stars were always to be seen by n ht, and

I was now entered on the seven-and-twentieth year of my
captivity in this place; though the three last years that I had

of the time. I kept the anniversary of my landing here with
the same thankfulness to God for his mercies as at first ; and'
if I had such cause of acknowledgment at first,I had much
more sonow, having such additional testimonies of the care-
of Providence over me, and the great hopes I had of being ef-
fectually and speedily delivered; for I had an invincible im-,
pression upon in thoughts that my deliverance was at hand,.
and that I shoul not be another year in this place. I went
on, however, with my husbandry ; divging, planting, and
'eucing, as usual. I gathered and cured my grapes, and did;
ever ' necessary thing as before.

The rainy season was, in the mean time, u on me, when I-
kept more within doors than at other times. Ve had stowed
our new vessel as secure as we could, bringil her up into the
creek, where, as I said in the beginning,l anded' my rafts
from the shi ', and haulin'r her up to the shore, at high-water
mark, I made: my man Friday ditIr a little dock, just big enough
to hold her, and just deep euou to give her water enough to
float in; and- then, when the ti was out, we made a strong
dam across the end of it, to keep the water out; and so she-
lay dry, as to the tide from the sea; and to keep the rain all}.
we laid a reat many boughs of trees, so thick that she. was as
well thatc ted as a house; and thus we waited for the Months
of November and December, in whichl designed to make my
adventure.

When the settled season began to come in, as the thought ot'
my design returned with the fair weather,.l was )re ) ring daily
{or the voyage; and the first thing I did was to ayliy a certain
quantity of provisions, being the stores for our voyage; and in-
tended, in a week or a fortnight's time, to open the dock and'
launch out our boat. I was busy one mornino' upon somethmg

as the flesh. riday had not been long one, when he came run-
ning back, and flew over my outer w I, or fence, like one that
felt not the ground, or the ste 5 he set his feet on; and before
I had time to speak to him, ie cries out to me, " 0 master!
0 master! 0 sorrow! 0 bad ! "--" What's the matter, Fri-
day 'l " says I. " O yonder, there," says he " one, two three
canoe; one, two, three!" By this way 0 speaking, con-
cluded there were six; but, on inquiry, I found it was but
three. " Well, Friday," sa 3 I " do not be fri htened."
So I heartened him up as wel asl could: however, saw the
poor fellow was most terribly scared; for nothing ran in his .
end but that they were come to look for him, an would cut
him in pieces, and eat him; and the poor fellow trembled so,
that I scarce knew what to do with him. I comforted him as
well as I could, and told him I was in as much danger as he,
and that they would eat me as well as him. " But " says I,
" Friday, we must resolve to fight them. Can you light, Fri-
day 1"---" Me shoot," says he; " but there come many great
number."--" No matter for that," said I, again; " our guns
will fright them that we do not kill." So I as ed him whether,
if I resolved to defend him, he would defend me, and stand by
me, and do just as I bid him. He said, " Me die when you
bid die, master." So I went and fetched a ood dram of rum
and ave him; for I had been so good a bus and of my rum,
that I had a great deal left. When he drank it, I made him
take the two fowling-pieces, which we always carried, and
loaded them with lar e swan-shot, as bi as small pistol-bullets :
then I took four mus ets, and loaded em With two slugs and
five small bullets each~ and my two pistols [loaded wnth a'
brace of bullets each: fhung my reat sword as usual, naked
by my side, and gave Friday his atchet. When I had thus
prepared myself, took my perspectiveflass, and went up to
the side of the hill, to see what I could iscover; and I found
uickl y, by my glass, that there were oneuand-twent ' savages,
tee prisoners, and three canoes; and that their w e bustg
ness seemed to be the triumphant banquet upon three, '
human bodies; a barbarous feast indeed! but nothing more
than, as I had observed, was usual with them. I observed,
also, that they were landed, not where they had done when
Friday made his escape, but nearer to my creek; where the
shore was low, and where a thick wood came almost close
down to the sea. This, with the abhorrence of the inhuman
errand those wretches came about, filled me with such indig-
nation, that I came down again to Friday, and told him I was
resolved to go down to them, and kill them all; and asked him
if he would stand b me. He had now at over his fright, and
his spirits bein a ittle raised with the gram I had given him,
he was very c ieerful, and told me, as before, he would die
when I bid die.

In this fit of fury, I took and divided the arms which I had
charged, as before, between us: I gave Friday one pistol to
stick in his girdle, and three guns upon his shoulder; and I
took one pistol, and the other three guns, myself; and in this
posture we marched out. I took a small bottle of rum in my
pocket, and gave Friday a large bag with more powder and
rullets; and, as to orders, I charged him to keep close behind
me, and not to stir, or shoot, or do any thing, till I bid him;
and, in the mean time, not to speak a word. In this posture
I fetched a compass to my right hand of near a mile, as we
to get over the creek as to et into the wood, so that I might
come within shot of them be ore I should be discovered, which
I had seen, by my lass, it was easy to do.

WhileI was m ing this march, my former thoughts re-
turning, I began to abate my resolution: I do not mean that
I entertained any fear of their number; for, as they were
naked, unarmed wretches, it is certain I was superior to them;
nay, though I had been alone. But it occurred to my
thoughts, what call, what occasion, much less what necessity
I was in, to go and dip my hands in blood, to attack people
who had neither done or intended me any wrong; who, as
to me, were innocent, and whose barbarous customs were their
own disaster; being, in them, a token indeed of God's having
left them, with the other nations of that part of the world, to

o
such stu idity, and to such inhuman courses; but did not call
me to ta e upon me to be a judge of their actions, much less
an executioner of his justice; that, whenever he thought tit,
he would take the cause into his own hands, and, by national
vengeance, punish them as a people, for national crimes; but
that, in the mean time, it was none of my business; that it
was true, Friday might justify it, because he was a declared
enemy, and in a state of war with those very particular people,
and it was lawful for him to attack them; but I could no: say
the same with respect to 'myself. These things were so warm-
ly pressed upon my thoughts all the way as I went, that I
resolved I would onl ' go and lace myself near them, that l
miwht observe their arbarous east, and that I would not then
as Ziod should direct; but that, unless somethin olfered that
was more a call to me than yet I knew of, I woulll not meddle
with them.

With this resolution I entered the wood; and, with all pos-
sible wariness and silence, Friday following close at my
heels, I marched till I came to the skirt of the wood, on the
side which was next to them, only that one corner of the wood
lay between me and them. Here 1 called softly to Friday, and
showin ' him a great tree, which was just at the corner of the
wood, bade hnn go to the tree, and bring me word if he
could see there plainly what they were domg. He did so;
and came immediately back to me, and told me they mi ht
be plainly viewed there; that they were all about their re,
eatm the flesh of one of their prisoners, and that another lay
boun u on the sand, :1 little from them, which, he said, the
would kill next, and which fired the very soul within me. e
told me it was not one of their nation, but one of the bearded
men he had told me of, that came to their country in the boat
1 was filled with horror at the very namin the white bearded
man; and, going to the tree, I saw lai y, by.my.glass, a
white man, who lay upon the beach 0 the sea, With his hands
and his feet tied with flaws, or things like rushes, and that he
was a European, and had3 clothes on. . '

There was another tree, and a little thicket beyond liq

4.3: __ .Q a,
about fifty yards nearer to them than the place where I was,
which, by going a little way about,l saw I mi ht come at undiso
covered, and that then I should be within h t'a shot of them :
so I withheld my passion, though I was indeed enraged to the
highest degree ' and l'oing bac about twenty lpaces, I got beo
hind some bus res which held all the way til Icame to the
other tree; and then came to a little rising ground, which
gay-3 me a full view of them, at the distance at about eighty
yar s.

I had now not a moment to lose, for nineteen of the dreadful
wretches sat u on the ground, all close huddled together, and
had just sent t ie other two to butcher the r Christian, and
bring him, perhaps limb by limb, to their re; and they were
stoopin down to untie the bands at his feet. Iturned to Fri-
day--". ow, F riday," said I, " do as I bid thee." Friday
said he would. " 'l'hen, Frida ," says I, " do exactly as you
see me do; fail in nothing." 0 I set down one of the mus-
kets and the fowlin -piece upon the ground, and Friday did
the like by his; an with the other musket I took my aim at
the sava es, biddinflr him to do the like : then asking him if he
was rca y, he said, " Yes." "Then fire at them," said I;
and the same moment I fired also.

Friday took his aim so much better than I, that on the side
that he shot, he killed two of them, and wounded three more;
and on my side, I killed one and wounded two. They were,
you may he sure, in a dreadful consternation ; and all ofthem
who were not hurt jumped upon their feet, but did not innue-
diately know which way to run, or which way to look, for
they knew not from whence their destruction came. Friday
kept his eyes close upon me, that, as I had bid him, he might
observe what I did; so, as soon as the first shot was made, I
threw down the piece, and took up the fowling-piece, and
Friday did the like: he saw me cock and present; he did the
stune again. " Are you ready, Friday?" said I.~" Yes,"
says he. "Let fly, then," says I, " in the name of God!"
and with that, I fired again among the amazed wretches, and
I0 did Friday; and as our pieces were now loaden with what

1 called swan-shot, or small pistol-bullets, we found only two
dro , but so many were wounded, that they ran about yelliu
an screamin like mad creatures, all bloody, and most 0*
them miserab y wounded, whereof three more fell quickly
after, thou h not quite dead.

" Now, riday," says l,laying down the discharged pieces,
and taking up the musket which was yet loadeu, " follow me ; "
which he out with a great deal of courage; own which [-
rushed out of the wood, and showed myselt, and 'riday close
at n ' foot. As soon as I perceived they saw me, 1 shouted as
lou asl could, and bade Friday do so too; and running as
fast as I could, which, by the way, was not very fast, being.
loaded with arms as I was, I made directly towards the poor
victim, who was, as 1 said, lying upon the heach, or shore, be>>
tween the place where they sat and the sea. The two butt-h-
ers, who were just going to work with him, had left him at the
surprise of our first tire, and find in a terrible fright to the set:-
side, and had jumped into a canoe, and three more of the rest; -
made the same way. 1 turned to Friday, and bade him step
forwards, and fire at them: he understood tne immediately,
and runnin about forty yards to be nearer them, he shot at
them and thought he had kilied them all, for 1 saw them all:
fall of a heap into the boat, though I saw two of them it I again

uickly: however, he killed two of them, and woum d the

t ird so, that he lay down in the bottom of the boat as if he
had been dead.

While my man Friday fired at them, I pulled out my knife
and cut the flags that bound the poor victim; and loosing his
hands and feet, I lifted him u , and asked him .in the Portu-
guese ton ue, what he was. rile answered in Latin, " Chris-
uanus; " at was so weak and faint that he could scarce stand
or speak._ I took my bottle out of my ket, and gave it him,
makmgstgna that he should drink, w ich he did; and I gave
him a piece of bread, which he ate. Then I asked him what
countryman he was; and he said, Espagniole; and bein a
little recovered, let me know, by all the signs he could possi ly
make, how much he was in my debt tor his deliverance

: _ a"?
"Seignior," said 1, with as much Spanish as I could make
up, " we will talk afterwards, but we must fight now; if you
have any strength left, take this istol and sword, and lay
about you." lie took them ver ' t iankt'ully ; and no sooner
had he the arms in his hands, hut, as if they had )ut new
vigor into him, he flew upon his murderers like a my, and
had out two of them in pieces in an instant; for the truth is,
as the whole was a surprise to them, so the poor creatures
were so much frightened with the noise of our pieces, tint
they tell down for more mnazemcut and fear, and had no
more power to attempt their own escape, than their flesh had
to resist our shot; and that was the case with those five that
Friday shot at in the boat; for as three of them tell with the
hurt they received, so the other two i'ell with the friwht.
l he it my piece in my hand still without firing, lieing will-
ing to lteep my charge ready, because I had given the Span-
iard my pistol and sword; so I called to Frida ', and bade him
run up to the tree from whence we first tire , and fetch the
arms which lay there that had been discharged, which he did
with great swrftness; and then, giving him my musket, I sat
down myself to load all the rest a rain, and bade them come to
me when they wanted. While was leading these pieces
there happened a fierce engagement between the Spaniard
and one of the savages, who made at him with one of their
<<meat wooden swords, the same-like wea ion that was to have
hilled him before, if I had not promote it. The Spaniard,
who was as bold and brave as could be imagined thou h weak,
had fought this Indian :1 good while, and had out im two
rcat wounds on his head; but the savawe, being a stout, lusty
ellow, closing in with him, had thrown rim down, being faint,
and was wringiuu' my sword out of his hand; when the Span-
iard, though unrfermost, wisely quitting the sword, drew the
Lustol from his girdle, shot the savage through the body, and
illed him upon the spot, before I (who was running to help
him) could come near him.

Friday, being now left to his liberty, pursued the flyin
wretches, with no weapon in his hand but his hatchet; an5344 nomxsox ('RUSOI-i.

with that he despatched those three, who, as I said before
were wounded at first, and fallen, and all the test he could
come up with; and the S ianiard comin to me for a gun, I
gave him one of the fow ing- iieces, wit which he pursued
two of the savages, and wouii ed them both; but, as he was
not able to run, they both ot from him into the wood where
Friday pursued them, and killed one of them, but the other was
too nimble for him; and though he was wounded, yet had
plunged himself into the sea, and swam, with all his might,
otf to those two who were left in the canoe, which three in the
canoe, with one wounded, that we knew not whether he died
or no, were all that escaped our hands of one and twenty. The
account ofthe whole is as follows: three killed at our first shot
from the tree; two killed at the'iiext shot; two killed by Friday
in the boat; two killed by Friday of those at first wounded;
one killed by Friday in the wood; three killed by the Spaniard ;
four killed, being found drop ed here and there, of their wounds,
or killed by Friday in his c ase of them; four escaped in the
boat, whereof one wounded, if not dead.--Twenty-one in all.

Those that were in the canoe worked hard to get out of im-
shot; and though Friday made two or three shots at them, did
not find that he hit any ofthem. Friday would fain have had
me take one oftheir canoes, and pursue them; and, indeed, I
was very anxious about their esca e, lest, carrying the news
home to their people, they shoul come back perhaps with
two or three hundred of the canoes, and devour us by mere
iniiltitude; so 1 consented to pursue them by sea and running
to one of their canoes, I jumped in, and bade Friday follow
me; but when I was in the canoe, I was surprised to find
another oor creature lie there bound hand and foot, as the
Spaniar was, for the slaughter, and almost dead with fear,
not knowing what was the matter; for he had not been able
to look up over the side of the boat, he was tied so hard neck
and heels, and had been tied so long, that he had really but
little life in him.

[immediately cut the twisted flags or rushes, which they
had bound him with, and would have helped him up; but he

could not stand or speak but groaned most piteously, believ-
iii , it seems, still, t iat lie was only unbound in order to be
k' ed. \Vlicii Friday came to him, I bade him speak to him,
and tell him of his deliverance; and, pulling out my bottle,
made him give the poor wretcli a drain; which, with the news
of his beiii ' delivered, rcviv ed him, and he sat u in the boat.
But when 'riday came to hear him speak, an look in his

Friday kissed him, embraced him hugged him, cried, laughed,
hallooed, jumped about, dance , suiif; then cried again,
wrung his hands, beat his own face an head; and then sung
aggdiuinped about again, like a distracted creature. It was a
g while before I could make him speak to me, or tell me
what was the matter 5 but when he came a little to himself, he
told me that it was his father. .

It is not easy for me to express how it moved me to see
what ecstasy and filial affection had worked in this poor sav-
age at the Sight of his father, and of his being delivered from
death; nor, indeed, can I describe half the extravagances of
his afl'ection after this; for he went into the boat, and out of
the boat, a great many times: when he went in to him, he
would sit down b him, open his breast, and hold his father's
head close to his bosom for many minutes together, to nourish
it 5 then he took his arms and ankles, which were numbed amfi
stifl' with the binding, and chafed and rubbed them with his
hands; and I, greening what the case was, gave him some
rum out of my tde to rub them with, which did them a great>>!
deal of good. '

This afl'air put an end to our gursuit of the canoe with the
other savages, who were now got most out of sight; and it was
happy for us that we did not, for it blew so hard within two
hours after, and before they could be Fot a quarter of their
way, and continued blowing so hard al night and that from
the north--west, which was against them, that I, could not sup.
pose their boat could live, or that they ever reached their own
tom

that 1 could no; find in my heart to take him off for some time;
but after I thought he could leave him a little, I called him to
me, and he canto jumping and laughing, and pleased to the
highest extreme: then I asked him if he had given his father
any bread. He shook his head, and said, " None; ugly dog
eat all up self." I then gave him a cake of bread, out of a
little pouch I carried on purpose; I also gave him a drain for
himself, but he would not taste it, but carried it to his father.
I had in mv ocket two or three bunches of raisins; so I gave
him a handfu of them for his father. He had no sooner given
his father these raisins, but I saw him come out of the boat, and
run away, as if he had been bewitched, he ran at such a rate
(for he was the swiftest fellow on his feet that ever I saw): I say,
he ran at such a rate, that he was out of si ht, as it were, in an
instant: and though I called, and hallooe out too, after him,
it was all one--away he went; and in a quarter of an hour I
saw him come back again, though not so last as he went; and
as he came nearer, I found his ace slacker, because he had
something in his hand. When 0 came up to me, I found he
had been quite home for an earthen 'ug, or pot, to bring his
father some fresh water, and that he had two more cakes or
loaves of bread: the bread he gave me, but the water he carried
to his father: however, as I was very thirsty too, I took a little
sup of it. The water revived his father more than all the rum
or spirits I had given him, for he was just faintin with thirst.
When his father had drank,I called to him to now if there
was any water left: he said, " Yes; " and I bade him give it
to the poor Spaniard, who was in as much want of it as his
father; and I sent one of the cakes, that Friday brought, to the
Spaniard too, who was indeed very weak, and was i'eposxnfi
himself it on a green place under the shade of a tree; an
whose lim )8 were also very stifl'. and ver ' much swelled with
the rude bandage he had been tied with. hen I saw that, upon
Friday's coming to him with the water, he sat up and drank,
and took the bread, and beam to eat, I went to him, and gave
him a handful of raisins: Ire looked up in my face with all
the tokens of gratitude and thankfulness that could appear
in any countenance: hut was so weak, notwithstandin he
had so exerted himselfin the fight, that he could not stand up
.upon his feet: he tried to do it two or three times, but was
really" not able, his ankles were so swelled and so painful to
.him; so I bade him sit still, and caused Friday to rub his
ankles, and bathe them with mm, as he had done his father's.
I observed the poor atl'ectionate creature, every two min-
utes, or perhaps less, all the while he was here, turn his head
about, to see if his father was in the same place and posture
as he left him sitting ; and at last he found he was not to be
seen; at which he started up, and, without 3 akin; a word,
.flew With that swifiness to him, that one coul scarce perceive
'his feet to touch the round as he went; but when he came,
he only found he had aid himself down to ease his limbs; so
Friday came back to me presently; and then I spoke to the
Spaniard to let Friday help him up, if he could, and lead him
to the boat, and then he should carry him to our dwelling.
where I would take care of him; but Fridag', a lusty, strap
follow, took the Spaniard quite up upon his ack, and earn
him away to the boat, and set him down softly uponthe side or
: unnel of the canoe, with his' feet in the inatde ofit; and then
ull'tlllg him quite in, he set him close to his father; and res-
.ently steppin out again, launched the boat OE, and died
zit along-the s e faster than I could walk, though _ Wind
ibiew prett ' hard too: so he brought them both safe Into our
ocreek, an leaving them in the boat,ran away to fetehtheoth-

awhither he went. He told me, "Go fetch more 'boatz" so
:away he went like the wind, for sure never man or horse ran
dike him; and he had the other canoe in the creek almost as
scones! ottoit byland; so hewafled rne ovenandthel

'but they were neither of them able to walk, so that peg Fra-

and Friday and I carried them both up together upon it,
between IE. . _

But when we got them to the outstde of our wall, or_fort1fi-
cation, we were at a worse less than before, for it was im so
sible to get them-over, and hiss. resolved not to lire it
down: so I set to work again; and Friday and I', inabout
two hours' time, made a very handsome tent, covered With old
sails, and above that with boughs of trees, beizg in the space
without our outward fence, an between that a the e of'
young wood which I had hinted; and here we in e them
two beds of such things as had, viz. of good rice straw, with
"amine upon it, to lie on, and another to cover them, on

M island was now peopled, and I thought. in self very rich
in an jectsi and it was a merry reflection, whit: I frequently
made, how hkea king I looked. First of all, the whole country
was my own. mere property, sothat I had an undoubted rights
of dominion. Secondly, my people were pesfactl subjected ;
I was absolutely lord and lawgiver; they all ow their lives.
to me, and were ready to lay down their lives, if there had
been occasion for it, for me. It was remarkable, too,I had!
but three sflects, and they were of ' three different religions :-
my than P y was a Protestant, his father wu a pagan and
a cannibal, and the Spaniard. was a Papist: however, I al--
lowed hberty of conscience throughout my Maison--But
this is by the way. a

As soon as I had secured my two weak rescued prisoners"
and given them shelter, and a place to rest them upon, I be-

.n to think of makina'some proaisionfor them ; and the first:
. mg I did; I ordered 'riday to take ayearling goat, betwixt;
a Ind and a oat, out of my particular flock, to be killed;
whaI cut 0 the hinder uarterzand' chopping it into small?
111qu I set Fridag tower to bailing and stewsng, and made
them a very good ish, I assure you, of flesh and broth, hav--
ing put some barle and rice also. into the broth; and as I
cooked it without .oors (far I made no fire within my inner:
nllLaol earned; it all. into the mutant, and'hasiag act's
table there for them, I sat down, and ate my dinner also with
them, and, as well as I could, cheered them and encouraged
them. Friday was my interpreter, especially to his father, and,
indeed, to the Spaniard too; for the Spaniard'spohe the lini-
guage of the savages pretty well.

After we had dined, or rather suppcd, I ordered Friday to
take one of the canoes, and go and fetch our muskets and
other lire--arms, which, lbr want of time, we had left upon the
place of battle; and, the next day, I ordered him to go and

ury the dead bodies of the savages, which lay open to the
sun, and would resently be offensive. i also ordered him to
bury the horridprermins of their barbarous feast, which I
knew were pretty much, and which I could not think ol'doing
myself; nay,I could not bear to see them, if I went that way;
all which he pnnctually peribrmed, and eli'aced the very ap-
pearance of the savages being there; so that when I went
again, I could scarce know where it was, otherwise than by
the corner of the wood pointing to the place.

I then began to enter into a little conversation with my two
new subjects; and, first, i set Friday to inquire of his Father
what he thought of the escape of the savages in that canoe,
and whether we might exlmct a return of them, with a power
too great for us to resist. 1113 first opinion was, that the saw
ages in the boat never could live out the storm which Now
that night they went off, but must, of necessity, be drowned,
or driven south to those other shores, where they were as sure
to be devoured as they were to be drowned if they were cast
away; but, as to what they would do, it' they came safe on
shore, he said he knew not; but it was his opinion, that they
were so dreadfully frightened with the manner of their being
attacked, the noise, and the fire, that he believed they would
tell the mo le they were all killed h thunder and lightning,
not by die land of man; and that t to two which appeared,
viz. Friday and I, wore two heavenly spirits, or l'nries, come
down to destroy them, and not men with weapons. This, he
said, he knew; because he heard them all cry out so, in their
language, one to another; for it was impossible for them to
conceive that a man could dart fire, and s alt thunder, and
kill at a distance, without lifting up the tand, as was done
now: and this old savage was in the right; for, as I under-
stood since, by other hands, the savages never attemptedto
go over to the island afterwards, they were so terrified With
the accounts given by those four men (for, it seems, they did
escape the sea), that they believed whoever went to that en-
chanted island would be destm'ed with fire from the gods.
This, however, I knew not; an therefore was under contin-
UJI : prehensions for a good while, and kept always upon my
fuar , with all my army; for, as there were now four of us,

Would have ventured upon a hundred of them, fairly in the
open field, at any time.

In a little time, however, no more canoes appearing, the
fear of their coming were off; and I began to take my for-
mer thoughts of a voyage to the main into consideration ; be-
ing liken'tse assured, by Friday's father, that I might depend
upon ood usage from their nation, on his account, if I would
go. at my thoughts Were a little suspended when I had
a serious discourse with the Spaniard, and when I understood
that there were sixteen more of his countr men and Portu-
guese, who, having been cast away, and ma e their escape to
that side, lived there at peace, indeed, with the sava es, but
were very sore ut to it for necessaries, and indeed for ille. I
asked him all t ie articulars of their v0 'age, and found they
were a Spanish 5 ip, bound from the i0 de la Plata to the
Havanna, being directed to leave their loading there, which
was chiefly hides and silver, and to bring back what European
goods they could--meeTwith there ; "that they had five Portu-
guese seamen on board, whom they took out of another week;
1; lat five of their own men were drowned, when first the shi was
lost, and that these escaped, through infinite dan ers unfltaz-
ards, and arrived, almost starved, on the canniba coast, where
the expected to have been devoured every moment. He
tol me they had some arms with them, but they were per-
fectly useless, for that. they had neither powder nor ball, the
washing of the tea havtng spoiled all their powder, but a little,
which they used, at their first landing, to provide themselves
some had.

I asked him what he thought would become of them there,
and if they had ibrmed any design of makin their escape.
He said they had many consultations about it; ut that havmg
neither vessel, nor_ tools to build one, nor provisions of an
kind, their councils always ended in tears and despair.
asked him how he thought the would receive a proposal from
me, which might tend towar s an escape; and whether, if
they were all here, it might not be done. I told him with
freedom, I kared mostly their treachery and ill usage of me,
if I put my life in their hands; for that gratitude was no in-
herent virtue in the nature of man, nor did men always square
their dealings by the obligations they had received, so much
as the did by the advant es they expected. I told him it
would very hard that I s d be the instrument of their
deliverance, and that they should afterwards make me their

risoner in New. Spain, where an Englishman was certain to
made a sacrifice, what necessity or what accident soever
brought him thither; and that I had rather be delivered a to
the savages, and be devoured alive, than fall into themerci ess
claws the riests, and be carried into the mqutsitton. 1
added, that ot rwise I was rsuaded, if the were all here,
we might, with so many ha a, build a bark arge enough to
carry us all away, either to the Brazils, southward, or to the
islands,.or Spanish coast, northward; but that if, in reqnital,
they should, when I had put weapons into their hands, carry me
by force among their own people, I might be ill used for my
kindness to them, and make in - case worse than itwas beibre.

He answered, with a great al of candor and in nous-
ness, that their condition was so miserable, and that t y were
so sensible of it, that, he believed, they would abhor the
thought of using any man unkindly that should contribute to
then deliverance; and that if 1 pleased, he would go to them
With the old man, and discourse with them about it, and return
again, and bring me their answer; that he would make eon-

absolutely under my leading, as their commander and ca tain ,
and that they should swear upon the holy sacraments an Gos-
pel, to be true tome, and g.) to such Christian country as that 1
should agree to, and no other, and to be directed wholly and abso-
lutely by my orders, till they were landed safely in such coun-
try as I intended; and that he would bring a contract from
them, under their hands, for that purpose. Then he told me
he would first swear to me himself, that he would never stir
from me as long as he lived, till I ave him orders; and that
he would take my side to the last drop of his blood, if there
should happen the least breach of faith among his countrymen.
He told me the were all of them very civil, honest men, and
they were un er the reatest distress imaginable, having
neither weapons or cloties, nor an food, but at the mercy
and discretion of the savages; out 0 all hopes of ever return-
ing to their own country; and that he was sure, if I would
undertake their relief, they would live and die by me. .
Upon these assurances, I resolved to venture to relieve
them, if possible, and to send the bld savage and this Span-
lard over to them to treat. But when we had at all things in
readiness to go, the Spaniard himself start" an objection,
which had so much prudence in it on one hand, and so much
sincerit on the other hand, that 1 could not but be very well
satisfie in it; and, b his advice, put of the deliverance of
his comrades for at least half a year. The case was thus:
He had been with us now about a month, durin which time
I had let him see in what manner I had provi ed, With the
assistance of Providence, for my sup rt; and he saw evi-
dently what stock of corn and rice had laid up; which,
though it was more than sufficient for myself, yet it was not
sufficient, without ood husbandry, for my family, now it was
increased to four; ut much less would it be suflicient if his
countrymen, who were, as he said, sixteen, still alive, should
come over; and, least of all, would it be sufficient to victual
our vessel, if we should build one, for a voyage to any of the
Christian colonies of America; so he told me he thought it
would be more advisable to let him and the other two dig anditoamsou causos. - 253

cultivate some more land, as much as I could spare seed to
sow, and that we should wait another harvest, that we might
have a supply of corn for his countrymen, when they should
come; for want might be a temptation to them to disagree,or
not to think themselves delivered, otherwise than out of one
diflicult into another. " You know," says he, "the children
of Israe , though they rejoiced at first for their being delivered
out of E3 pt, yet rebelled even against God himself, that
delivered t m, when they came to want bread in the wil-
derness."

His caution was so seasonable, and his advice so good, that
I could not but be very well fipleased with his eHroposal, as well
as I was satisfied with his delity: so we I to digging, all
four of us, as well as the wooden tools we were furnished with
permitted; and in about a month's time, by the end of which
it was seed-time, we had got as much land cured and trimmed
up as we sowed two-and-twenty bushels of barley on, and six-
teen jars ol' rice; which was, in short, all the seed we had to
spare; nor, indeed, did we leave ourselves barley suficient for
our own food, for the six months that we had to expect our
cro ; that is to say, reckoning from the time we set our seed
asi e for sowing; tor it is not to be supposed it is six months
in the ground in that country. .

Havrne now society enough, and our number being sufficient
to put us out of fear of the sav es, if they had come (unless
their number had been very great , we went freely all over the
island, whenever we found occasion; and as here we had our
escape or deliverance u it our thoughts, it was impossible, at
least for me, to have t means of it out of mine. For this
pur , I marked out several trees which I thought fit for our
wor , and I set Friday and his father to cutting them down;
and then I caused the Spaniard, to whom I imparted my thoughts
on that afi'air, to oversee and direct their work. I showed
them with what indefatifable pains I had hewed a latrlfie tree
into sin le planks, and caused them to do the like, ' they
had m a about a dozen large planks of good oak, near two
feet broad, thirty-five feet long, and float two inches to in!

G
inches thick: what prodigious labor it took up, any one may
imagine.

At the same time, I contrived to increase my little flock
of tame ats as much as Icould; and, for this purpose, I
made Fri ay and the S amard go out one day,and myself
with Friday the next ay (lbr we took our turns), and b
this means we got about twenty younC/r kids to breed up wit
the rest; for whenever we shot the dam, we saved the kids,
and added them to our flock. But above all, the season for
curing the grapes coming on, I caused such a prodigious quan~
tity to be hung up in the sun, that, I believe, had we been at.
Alicant, where the raisins of the sun are cured, we could have
filled sixty or eighty barrels; and these, with our bread, was a
great art of our food, and was very good living too, I assure
you, or it is exceeding nourishing.

It was now harvest, and our crop in good order: it was not
the most plentiful increase I had seen in the island, but, how-
ever, it was enough to answer our end; for, from twenty-two
bushels of barley we brou ht in and threshed out above two
hundred and twenty hushe s, and the like in proportion of the
rice ; which was store enough for our food to the next harvest,
thou h all the sixteen Spaniards had been on shore with me;
or, -i we had been ready for a voyage, it would very plentifully
have victualled our ship to have carried us to any part of the
world, that is to say, any part of America. When we had thus
housed and secured our magazine of corn, we fell to work to
make more wicker--ware, viz. great baskets, in which we kept
it; and the Spaniard was ver ' randy and dextrous at this part,
and often blamed me thatl id not make some things for de-
fence of this kind of work: but I saw no need of it.

And now, having a full supply of food for all the guestsl
expected, I gave the Spaniar eave to go over to the main, to
see what he could do With those he had left behind them there.
I gave him a strict charge not to bring an man with him who
would not first swear, in the presence 0 himself and the old
savage, that he would.no way injure, fight With, or attack the
person he should find in the Island, who was so kind as toaend
(hr them in order to their deliverance; but that they would stand
by him, and defend him against all such attempts, and wherever
they went, would be entirely under and subjected to his com-
mand; and that this should be put in writi ,and signed with
their hands. How they were to have done t is, when I knew
they had neither pen nor ink, was a question which we never
asked. Under these instructions, the Spaniard and the old
savage, the father of Friday, went away in one of the canoes
who they might be said to come in, or rather were brought in

when they came as prisoners to be devoured by the savages. I
gave eac of them a musket, with a firelock on it, and about
eight charges of powder and ball, charging them to be very
good husbands of_ both, and not to use either of them but
upon urgent occasions.

This was a cheerful work, being the first measures wed by
me, in view of my deliverance, for now twenty-seven ears and
some days. I gave them rorisions of bread, of dried

tapes, sufficient fhr themse ves for many days, and sufficient
or all the Spaniards for about eight days' time; and wishing
them a food voyage I saw them go; agreeing with them about
a si n! they should hang out at their return, by which I
shou (I know them again, when they came back, at a distance,
before they came on shore. They went away with a fair gale,
on the day that the moon was at full, by my account, in the
month of October; but as for an exact reckoning of days, after
Ihad once lost it,I could never recover it again; nor had]
kept even the number of years so punctually as to be sure I
was right; thou h, as it proved, when] afierwards exammed
my account, I ouud I had kept a true reckoning of years.
t was no less than eight days I had waited for them, when
a strange and unforeseen accident intervened, of which the
like has not rhaps, been heard of in history. I was fast
asleep in my utch one morning, when my man Friday came
running in to me, and called aloud, " Master, master, they are
come, they are come ! " I jum up, and, regardless of
danger, I went out as soon as could get my clothes .on,
through my little grove, which, by the way, was by this time

,. A. ".muglfaa 3 3'...__~_._.!.. '3'..._._.a_u. "ELL"...
grown to be a very thick wood; I say, regardless of danger, 1
went without my arms (which was not my custom to do): but
I was surprised, when, turning my eyes to the sea, I presently
saw a boat at about a league and a half distance, standinv in
for the shore, with a shoulder-of-mutton sail, as they call it,
and the wind blowing pretty fair to bring tltcm in; also 1 ob-
served presently, that t Iey did not come from that side which
the shore lay on, but from the southernmost end of the island.
Upon this I called Friday in, and bade him lie close; for these
were not the ample we looked for, and that we might not
know vet whet ier they were friends or (menties. In the next
place I went in to fetch my perspective-glass, to see whatI
could make ofthem ; and. having taken the ladder out, [climbed
up to the top of the hill, as I used to do when I was apprehen-
sive of anything, and to take my view the plainer, without
being discovered. I had scarce set my foot upon the hilf,
when my eye plainly discovered a ship lying at an anchor, at
about two leagues and a half distance from me, S. S. 13., be
not above a league and a half from the shone. By my obset
vation, it appeared )lainly to be an English ship, and the boa
ap )eared to be an anglish long-boat. _
cannot express the confusion I was in; though the joy ol
seeing a ship, and one that I had reason to believe was manned
by my own countrymen, and consequently friends, was such
as 1 cannot describe; but yet I had some secret doubts hung
about me,----l Cannot tell from whence they came,----bidding me
keep upon my guard. In the first place, it occurred to me
to consider what business an English ship could have in that
part of the world, since it was not the way to or from any part
of the world where the En lish had any traffic; and I knew
there had been no storms toldrive them in there, as in distress;
and that if they were really English, it was most probable that
they were here upon no good design ; and that I had better con-
tinue as I was, than fall into the hands of thieves and murderers.
Let no man despise the secret hints and notices of danger,
which sometimes are given him when he may think there is

no possibility of its being real. That such hints and notice:

"at. In n .
are given us, I believe few that have made any observations
of things can deny'; that they are certain discoveries of an in-
ylslble world, and. a converse of sgierits, we cannot doubt; and
'f the tendency of them seems to to warn us of dan r, why
should we not suppose they are from some frien y agent
(whether supreme, or inferior and subordinate, is not the.
question), and that they are given for our good?

. The present question abundantly confirms me in the jus-
tice of this reasoning; for had I not been made cautious by
this secret admonition, come it from whence it will, I had been.
undone mevttably, and in a far worse condition than before,
as you will see presently. I had not kept myself long in this
fosture but I saw the boat draw near the shore, as if the
00 ed for a creek to thrust in at, for the convenience of [an
ing ; however, as they did not come quite far enough, they did
not see the little inlet where I formerly landed my rafis but run
their boat on shore upon the beach, at about half a mile from me,
which was very happy or me; for otherwise the would have
landed just at my oor, as I may say, and wo d soon have
beaten me out of my castle, and perhaps have plundered me
of all I had. When they were on shore, I was fully satisfied
they were E lishmen, at least most of them; one or two!
thought were utch, but it did not prove so: there were in all
eleven men, whereof three of them I found were unarmed
and, as I thought, bound; and when the first four or five of
them were jumped on shore, they took those three out of the
boat, as prisoners . one of the three I could. perceive using the
most passionate ogestures of entreaty, affliction, and despair,
even to a kind extrav ance; the other two,l muld per~
oeive, lifted up their 11 sometimes, and appealed con~
cerned, indeed, but not to such a degree as the first. I was
perfectly confounded at the sight, and knew not what the
meaning of it should be. Friday called out to me In English,
as well a he could, "O inner! you see English mans eat
Prisoner as wefl as savage _Inans."---" Why, Fnda ," an s I],
'do on think they are going to eat them then! --" 031..

day; I am afraid they will murder them, indeed, but you may
be sure they will not eat them."

All this while I had no thoughtof what the matter really
was, but stood trembling with the horror of the sight, ex ct-
Ing every moment when the three prisoners should be h ed;
nay, once I saw one of the villains lift u i his arm with a reat
cutlass, as the seamen call it, or swor , to strike one o the
poor men; and I expected to see him fall every moment; at
which all the blood in my body wemed town chill in my
veins. I wished heartily now for my 8 aniard, and the sav-
age that was gone with him, or that I tad any way to have
come undiscovered within shot of them, that I might have ree-
cued the three men, for I saw no fire-arms they had amon
them; but it fell out to my mind another way. Afier I has
observed the outrageous us e of the three men by the inso-
lent seamen, I observed the ows run scatterin about the
island, as if they wanted to see the country. I 0 ed thu
the three other men had liberty to so also where they pleased;
but the sat down all three upon the ground, very pensive,
and loo edlikemenin des air. Thisput meinmindoftho

how I gave myself over for loa; how wildly I looked round
me; what dreadful a prehensiens I had; and how} lodged
in the tree all night, or fear of beingedevoured bywtld beasts.
As I knew nothin , that night, of t supply I was to receive
by the providenti drivin of the ship nearer the land by tin
storms and tide, by which have since been so loo launched
and supported; as these three poor desolate men \rnoth-
ing how certain of deliverance and supply the were, how
near it was to them, and how eflectually and real; the re
in a condition of safety, at the same time that t y ht
themselves lost, and their case desperate. So little do we see
before us in the world, and so much reason have we to depend
cheerfully upon the great Maker of the. world, that he does

It was just at the top of high water when these people came
on shore; and partly while they rambled about'to see what
kind of a place they were in, they had carelessly staid till the tide
was spent, and the water was ebbed constderably away, leav-
ing their boat round. They had left two men in the boat,
who, as I foun afterwards, having drank a little too much
brandy, fell aslee ; however, one of them waking a little
sooner than the 0 er, and finding the boat too fast aground
for him to stir it, hallooed out for the rest, who were straggling
about; n which they all soon came to the boat: but It was
past all t ieir stren th to launch her, the boat bein r very heavy,
and the shore on t at side being a soft, oozy sa , almost like
a quicksand. In this condition, like true seamen, who are
perhaps the least of all mankind iven to forethought, they
gave it over, and away they stroll about the country again;
and I heard one of them say aloud to another, calling them ofi.'
from the boat, " Why, let her alone, Jack can't you? she'll '
float next tide:" by which I was fully confirmed in the main
inquir of what countrymen they were. All this .while I kept
_ mysel very close, not oncedaring to stir out of my castle, any
farther than to m lace of observation, near the top of the
hill ; and very glad'lpwas to think how well it was fortified. I
knew it was no less than ten hours before the boat could float
again, and by that time it would be dark, and I might be
at more libert to see their motions, and to hear their dis-
course, if they ad any. In-the mean time, I fitted myself up for
a battle, as before (t h with more caution), knowing I had
todo With another kin of enemy than I had at first. lor-

of_ t _day, I found that, in short, they were all gone strag-
fillng into the woods, and, as I thought, laid down to sleep

'he three poor distressed men, too anxious for their condition
to get any sleep, were, however, sat down under the shelter
of a great tree, at about a quarter of a mile from .me, and, as
I thought, out of sight of any of the rest. Upon this] resolved
to discover myself to them, and learn something of their con-
dition. Immediately I marched in the figure as above my
man Friday at a good distance behind me, as formidab e for
his arms as I, but not making quite so staring a spectre-like
figure as I did. I came as near them undiscovered as I could,
and then, before any of them saw me, I called aloud to them
in Spanish, " What are ye, gentlemen?" They started up
,at the noise; but were ten times more confounded when they
saw me, and the uncouth fi ure that I made. They made no
answer at all, but I thought perceived them just going to fly
from me, when I spoke 'to them In En lish: "Gentlemen, '
said I, " do not be surprised at me: per aps on may have a
friend near, when you did not expect i ."----" a must be sent
directly from heaven, then," said one of them very gravely to
me, and pulling off his hat at the same time to me; " tor our
condition is past the help of man."--" All help is fi-om
Heaven sir," said I: " but can you put a stranger in the way
how to help iyou? for you seem to be in some great distress.
I saw you w en you landed; and when you seemed to make
a plication to the brutes that came with you,I sawone of

em lift up his sword to kill you."

The poor man, with tears running down his face and
trembling looking like one astonished, returned, "Am 1' talk-
ing to God or man? Is it areal man or an angel?"---" Be in
no fear about that, sir," said I; "if God had sent an angel to
relieve you, he would have come better clothed, and armed
afler another manner than you see me: dpray lay aside your
fears; I am a man, an Englishman, an disposed to assist
you; you see I have one servant only; wehave arm-pd am-

case 7"--" Our case," said he, " sir, is too long to tell you,
while our murderers are so near us: but, In short, sir, I was
commander of that ship; my men have mutinied against me;
they have been hardly prevailed on not to murder me; and at
last have set me on shore in this desolate place, with these two
men with me, one my mate, the other a passenger, where we
expected to perish, believing the lace to be uninhabited, and
know not yet what to thmk o it."--" Where are these
brutes, your enemies?" said I: "do you know where they
are gone'I"--" There they lie, sir," said he, pointing to a
thicket of trees; " my heart trembles for fear they have seen
us, and heard you s ak; if they have, they will certainly
murder us all. '--"ISS:ve they any fire--arms?" said 1. He
answered, " They had only two pieces, one of which they
left in the boat." " Well then," said I, "leave the rest to me;
I see they are all asleep; it is an easy thing to kill them all : but
shall we rather take them prisoners?" He told me'there
were two desperate villains among them, that it was scarce safe
to show any mere ' to; but if they were secured he believed
all the rest woul return to their duty. I asked him which
they were. He told me he could not at that distance distin-

uish them, but he would obey my orders in any thing I would

irect. " Well," says I, "let' us retreat out of their view or
hearinghlest they awake, and we will resolve further." 80' '
they wullmgly went back with me, till the woods covered us
from them.

"Look you, sir," said I, "if I venture upon our deliver-
ance, are you willing to make two conditions wit me?" He
anticipated my proposals, by telling me, that both he and the
ship, if recovered, should be wholly directed and commanded
by me in every thing; and if the ship was not recovered, he
would live and die with me in what part of the world soever
I would send him ; and the two other men said the same.
"Well," says I, " my conditions are but two: first, That
while you stay in this island with me, you will not pretend to
any authority here; and If I put arms in your hands, you will,
upon all occasions, give them up to me, and do no prejudice
'tomeor mine upon this island; and, in the mean time, be
Egverned by my orders: secondly, That if the ship is or ma
recovered, you W1" carry me and my man to Englan ,
passage free."

He gave me all the assurances that the invention or faith
of man could devise, that he would comply with these most'
reasonable demands; and, besides, would one his life to me,
and acknowledge it upon all occasions, as long as he lived.
" Well then," said I, " here are three muskets for you, with
powder and ball: tell me next what you think is pro r to be
done." He showed all the testimonies of his gratitu e that he
was able, but offered to be wholly guided b me. I told him i
thought it was hard venturing any thing; ut the best method
I could think of was to fire upon them at once, as they lay, and
if any were not killed at the hrst volley, and ofl'ered to submit,
we might save them, and so put it wholly upon God's provi-
dence to direct the shot. He said_very modestl , that he was
loath to kill them, if he could help it; but that t two were
incorrigible villains, and had been the authors of all the mutiq
in the ship, and if they escaped, we should be undone still;
for they would go on board and bring the whole ship's compa-
ny, and destroy us all. " Well then," says I, " necessity le-

itimates my advice, for it is the only wag-e? .save our lives."

owever, seein him still cautious of s ding blood, I told
him they shoul go themselves, and manage as they found
convenient.

In the middle of this discourse we heard some of them
awake, and soon alter we saw two of them on their feet. I
asked him if either of them were the heads of the mutiny. He
said, " No." " Well then," said I, "you may let them escape;
and Providence seems to have awakened them on purpose to
save themselves. " Now," says I, " if the rest escape you, it
is your fault." Animated with this, he took the musket I had
given him in his hand, and a pistol in his belt, and his two
comrades with him, with each a piece in his hand; the two
men who were with him, going first, made some noise, at which
onoofthoseamen,who mawakgturmd aboutnnd nuns
them coming, cried out to the rest; but it was too late then,
for the moment he Cried out they fired; I mean the two men,
the captain wisely reserving his own piece. They had so well
aimed their shot at the men they knew, that one of them was
killed on the spot, and the other very much wounded; but, not
being dead, he started up on his feet, and called ea erly for
help to the other; but the ca tain ste ping to him, to d him it
was too .late to cry for help ; lie should'call upon God toforgive
his villany; and with that word knocked him down with the
stock ot'his musket, so that he never 5 ke more: there were
three more in the company, and one 0 them was also slightly
wounded. By this time I was come; and when they saw
their danger, and that it was in vain to resist, they begged for
mercy. l'he ca tain told them he would spare their lives, if
they would give iim any assurance of their abhorrence of the
treachery they had been guilty of, and would swear to be faith-
ful to him in recovering the ship, and afterwards in carrying
her back to Jamaica, from whence they came. They gave
him all the protestations of their sincerity that could be desrred,
and he was willing to believe them, and spare their lives, which
I was not against, only that I obliged him to keep them bound,
hand and foot, while they were on the island.

W hilc this was doing, I sent Friday with the captain's mate
to the boat, with orders to secure her, and bring away the oars
and sails, which they did; and by and by three straggling men,
that were (happily for them) parted from the rest, came back,
upon hearing t e guns tired; and seeing the captain, who before
was their prisoner, now their conqueror, they submitted to be
bound also; and so our victory was com lete.

It now remained that the ca tain and should in uire into
one another's circumstances: began first, and to] him my
whole history, which he heard with an attention even to amaze-
ment; and particularly at the wonderful manner of m being
furnished with provisions and ammunition; and, indee , as my
story is a whole collection of wonders, it affected him deeply.
But when he reflected from thence upon himself, and how I
-Ieemed to have been preserved there on purpose to save his
life, the tears ran down his face, and he could not speak a word
more. After this communication was at an end. I carried him
and his two men into my apartment. leading them in just
where I came out, viz. at the top of the house, where I refreshed
them with such provisions as I had, and shamed them all
the contrivances I had made, during my long, long inhabiting
that lace.

A I showed them, all I said to them, was perfectly ama-
zing; but, above all, the captain admire-l my fortification, and '
how perfectly I had concealed my retreat with a grove oftrees,
which, having been now planted near twenty ears. and the
trees growing much faster than in England, was lemme a little
wood, and so thick, that it was impassable in any part of it, but
at that one side where I had reserved my little wmdin passage
into it. I told him this was my castle and my resi ence, but
that I had a seat in the country, as most princes have, whither
I could retreat upon occasion, and I would show him that too
another time; but at present our business was to consider how
to recover the ship. He agreed with me as to that; but told
me, he was perfectly at a loss what measures to take, for. that
there were still six-and-twenty hands, on board. who, having
entered into a cursed conspiracy, by which they had all for-
feited their lives to the law, would he hardened in it now by
desperation. and would carry it on, knowing that, if they were
subdued, they would be brought to the gallows as soon as they
came to England, or to any ol the English colonies; andthath
therefore, there would be noattacking them with so w
number as we were. . -

I mused for some time upon what he had said, and found it
was a very rational conclusron, and that, therefore, something
wasto be resolved on s eedily, as well to draw the men on
board into some snare or their surprise. as to prevent '
landing upon us, and destroyin us. U on this, it preset? _ .
occurred to me, that in a little w ile the s ip's crew, wonderin
what-was become of their comrades, and of the boat, woul
certainly come on shore in their other boat, to look for them;
and that then. pghaps, they might come armed, and he too266 Konmsmv CRUSOEL

stron for us: this he allowed to be rational. U n this, :I told
him t 1e first thintr we had to do was to stave t 1e boat, which
lay upon the beach, so that they might not carry her 011'; and
ta ing every thing out of her, leave her so far useless as not to
be fit to swum: accordingly we went on- hoard, took the arms
which were left on board out Of her, and whatever else we
fimnd there, which was a bottle of brandy, and another of rum;
a few biscuit-cakes, a horn of powder, and a great lump of
sugar in a piece of canvass (the sugar was- five or six pounds);
all which was very welcome to me, especially the brandy and
sufiar, of which I had none left for many years.

hen we had carried all these things on shore (the oars,
mast, sail, and rudder of the boat were carried away before,
as above), we knocked a great hole in her bottom, that ifthey
had come strong enough to master us, yet they could n06
carry 011' the boat. Indeed, it was not much in my thoughts
that we could be able to recover the shi ; but my view was,
that if they went away without the boat, did not much quesa
tiou to make her fit again to carry us to the Leeward Islands,
and call upon our friends, the Spaniards, in my way ; lbr I had
them: still In my thoughts.

While we were thus preparing our designs, and had first, by
main strength, heaved the bout upon the beach so- ltigh, that
the tide would not float her' ofi' at high water marlc, and be-I
sides, had brokea hole in her bottom too big to be quickly
stopped, and were set down musi what we should do, we
heard the ship fire a gun, and saw ier make a wait with her
ensign, as a signal for the boat to come on board: but no boat
stirred; and they fired several times, making other signals for
the_boat. At last, when all their sivnals and firing proved
fruitless, and they found the boat did, not stir, we saw them,
<<by the help of my glasses, hoist another boat out, and row
towards the shore; and we found, as th approached, that
there were no less than ten men in her, argtbat they had fire-
arms with them. ' .

their faces; because the tide having set them a little to the
east of the other boat, they rowed up under shore, to come to
the same lace where the other had ended, and where the boat
lay; byt is means, I say, we had a full view of them, and
the captain knew the persons andcharacters of all the men in
theaboat, of whom, he said, there were three very honest fol-
lows, who, he was sure, were led into this conspiracy by the
test, being overpowered and frightened; but that as for the
boatswain, who, it seems, was the chief oficer among them,
and all the rest, the were as outrageous as any of the ship's
crew, and were no oubt made desperate in their new enter-
prise; and terribly ap rehensive he was that they would be
too powerful fbr us. smiled at him, and told him that men
in our circumstances were past the operation of Ear; t
seeing almost every condition that could be was better t
that which we were so posed to be in, we ought toexpect that
the consequence, whet r death or life, woul be sure to be a
deliverance. I asked him what he thought of the circum-
stances of my life, and whether a deliverance we not worth
venturing for. "And where, sir," said I, " is you belief ofmy
bein preserved here on purpose to save your life, which ele-
vate you a little while ago. For my part," and I, "there
seems to me but one thing amiss In all the rospect of It."
" What is that! " says he. " Why," said , "It is, that as
you say there are three or four honest fellows among them,
which should be spared, had they been all of the wicked
of the crew, I should have thought God's provrdence
singled them out to deliver them into your hands; for depend
upon it, every in that comes ashore are our own, and shall
die or live as the behave to us." As I spoke this With a
raised voice and cheerful countenance, I lbund_it greatly eu-
eouraged him; so we set vigorously to our business. . 3
We had, upon the first appearance of the boat's wrung
from the ship, considered of separating our prisoners; and we
had, Indeed, secured them efi'ectually. Two of them, of whom
the captain was less assured than ordinary, I sent with Friday,

were remote enou h, and out of danger of bein heard or dis-
covered, or of fimfing their way out of the w a if they could
have delivered themselves: here they left them bound, but
gave them rovisions, and promised them, if they continued
there quiet y, to give them their liberty in a day or two, but
that, it they attempted their escape, they should be put to
death without mercy. They romised faithfull to bear their
confinement with patience, and were very thanhful that they
had such good usage as to have provisions and light left them;
for Friday gave them candles (such as we made ourselves) for
their comfort; and they did not know but that he stood sentinel
over them at the entrance.
The other risoners had better usage; two of them were
1{Kept pinione , indeed, because the ca tain was not free to
ust them; but the other two were ta en into my service,
upon the captain's recommendation, and u on their solemnly
engaging to live and die With us; so wrth hem and the three
honest men, we were seven men well armed; and I made no
doubt we should be able to deal well enough with the ten that
were coming, considering that the captain had said there were
three or fiiur honest men among them also. As soon as they
at to the place where their other boat lay, they ran their boat
into the beach, and came all on shore, hauling the boat up alter
them, which I was glad to see; for I was afraid the would
rather have left the boat at an anchor, some distance rom the
shore, with some hands in her, to guard her, and so we should
not be able to seize the boat. Being on shore, the first thing
they did, they ran all to their other boat; and it was eas to
see they were under a great snr rise to find her stripgfd, as
above, of all that was in her, an a great hole in her ttom.
After they had mused a while u n this, they set up two or '
three great shouts, hallooing with0 all their might, to try if they
could make their companions hear; but all was to no purpose:
then they came all close in a ring, and fired a volley of their
small arms, which, indeed, we heard, and the echoes made the
woods rinwg but it was all one: those in the cave we were sure
could not hear, and thosejn our keeping, though they heard
it well enough, yet durst give no answer to them. They were
so astonished at the surprise of this, that, as they told us after.
wards, they resolved to go all on board again, to their ship,
and let them know that the men were all murdered, and the
long-boat stayed; accordingly, they immediately launched
their boat again, and got all oi'thcin on board.

The captain was terribly amazed, and even confounded at
this, believing they would go on board the ship again, and set
sail, iving their comrades over for lost, and so he should still
lose t ie ship, which he was in hopes we should have recovered;
but he was quickly as much frightened the other way.

They had not been long put olt' with the boat, but we per-
ceived them all coming on shore again; but with this new
measure in their conduct, which it seems they consulted
gether upon, viz. to leave three men in the boat and the re
to go on shore, and go up into the country to look for their
fellows. This was a great disappointment to us, for now we
were at a loss what to do; as our seizing those seven men on
shore would be no advantage to us, if we let the boat escape;
because they would then row away to the ship, and then the
rest of them would be sure to weigh and set sail and soour
recovering the shi would be lost. However, we'had no rem-
edy but to wait an see what the issue of things might present.
The seven men came on shore and the three who remained in
the boat put her ofl' to a good distance from the shore, and
came to an anchor to wait for them; so that it was impossible
tbr us to come at them in the boat. Those that came on shore
kept close together, marching towards the top of the little hill
under which my habitation lay; and we could see them
painly, though they could not perceive us. We could have

_ ii very glad they would have come nearer to us, so that we
might have fired at them, or that they; would have gone farther
oh; that we might have come abroad. But when they were
come to the brow of the hill, where they could see a great way
into the valleys and woods, which lay towards the north-east
may"! where the island lay lowest, they shouted and hal-

ture far from the shore, nor far from one another, they sat
dOWll together under a tree, to consider of it. Had they
thought lit to have gone to slee i there, as the other part of
them had done, they had done tllte job for us; httt they were
too full of apprehensions of danger to venture to Iro to sleep,
though they could not tell what the danger was tiey had to
fear, neither.

The captain tnade avery just troposal to tne upon this con-
sultation of theirs, viz. that per taps they would all fire 3. vol-
Iey again, to endeavor to make their fellows hear, and that we
should all sally nron them, just at the juncture when their
pieces were all discharged, and they would certainly yield,
and we should have them without bloodshed. I liked this ro-
posal, provided it was done while we were near enougt to
cotne up to them before they could load their pieces again.
But this event did not happen; and we lay still a lon r ttnte,
very irresolnte what course to take. At length I to] them
there would be nothing done, in my opinion, till night; and
then, it'they did not return to the boat, perhaps we might find
a way to get between them and the shore, and so might use
some stratagelu with them in the boat to get tltem on shore.
We waited a great while, though very impatient for their re-
moving, :md were very uneasy, when, after long consultations,
we saw them all start up, and march down towards the sea:
it seems they had such dreadful apprehensions upon them of
the danger of the place, that they resolved to go on board the
shi ) again, give their companions over for lost, and so go on
wit their intended voyage with the ship.

As soon as I perceive them to go towards the shore, I im-
agined it to be, as it really was, that they had given over'their
search, and were for going back again; and the captain, as
soon as I told him tny thoughts, was ready to sink at the appre-
hensions of it; but 1 )t'esently thought of a stratagem to fetch
them back again, ant which answered my end toa tittle. I
ordered Friday and the captain's mate to go over the little
creek westward, towards the place where the sav s came on
shore when Friday was rescued; and as soon as ey cannot.
a'l'itfle rising ground, at about half a mile distance, I bade
them halloo out, as loud as they could, and wait till they found
the seamen heard them; that as soon as ever they heard the
seamen answer them, they should return it again; and then,
keeping out of saght, take a round, always answering when
.the others hallooe , to draw them as far into the island, and
among the woods, as ssible, and then wheel about again to
sue by such ways as directed them.

They were just going into the boat, when Friday and the
anate hallooed; an they presently heard them, and answer-
.iiig, run floor the shore westward, towards the voice they
heard, when t ey were presently stopped by the creek where,
the water being up, they could not get over, and called for the
:boat to come up and set them over- as, indeed, I eigcted.
Wlieii they had set themselves overj observed that hoot
ibeing gone a hood way into the creek, and, as it were, in a
diarbor within the land, they .took one of the three men out of
her, to go along with them, and left only two in the boat, hav-
ing fastened her to the stump of a little tree on. the shore.
This was what I wished for; and immediately leavmg Frida
and the captain's mate to their business, I took the .rest wit
me, and crossing the creek out of their sight, we surprised
the two men betore they were aware; one of them I ing on
rtlie shore, and the other bein in the boat. The w on
shore was between slee rig an waking, and going to start up:
ahe captain, who was creinost, ran in upon him, and knocked
him down,- and then called out to him in the boat to yield, or
.'he was a dead man. There needed very few arguments to
- rsuade asingle man to yield, when he saw five men upon
' 'm, and his comrade knocked down; beSIdes, this was, it
:seems, one of the three who were not so hearty !" the mutiny
as the rest oftlie crew, and therefore was eastly persuaded
:not only to yield, but afterwards to join very sincerely with
us. Iii-the mean time, Friday and the captain's mate so well
managed their business with the rest that they drew them by
diallooin and answerinw, from one hill to anotMr, and lion

left them. where they were very sure they could not reach
back to the boat beliore it was dark; and, indeed, they were.
heartily tired themselves also, by the time they came back
to. us.

We-had. nothing now to do but to watch ibr. them in the
dark, and to fall upon. them, so as to make sure work witls
them. it was several hours after Friday came back to me
before they came back to their boat; and we could hear the
foremost of them, long beibre they came quite up, calling to
those behind tocome along; and could also hear them answer,
and complain how lame and tired. they were,_and' not able to
come any faster; which. was very welcome news to us. At
length they came up to the boat' but it is impossible to ex-
press their confusimi when they tzound the boat as: aground
in the creek, the tide ebbed out, and their two men gone..
We could hear them call to one another in a most lamentable
manner, telling one another they were got into an enchanted'
island; that either there were inhabitants in it, and they
should all be murdered, or else there were devils and spirits
in it, and they should be all carried away and devoured.
They hallooed again,and called their two comrades by their
names a great many times ;._ but no answer. Alter sometime,
we coulda see them,_by thelittle light there was, run about,
wringing their hands like men in des air ; andthat sometimes
diey would go and sit down in the t, to rest themselves;
then come ashore again, and'wallt about again, and so the
same thing over am. My men would ram have had me-
give them eave to. all upon them at once in the dark; but I"
was wdlingrto take them at some advantage, so'to spare them,

did not separate; and, therefore, to make sure of them, L'
drew my ambuscade nearer, and ordered Friday and the cap-
tam to cm upon their hands and feet, as closeto the ground!
as the d, that. the might not be discovered, and t as
near as they c possibly,_befim-they ofiaredflo .~.
They had not been.loi_ig in that posture, when the boat-
swain, who was the principal rin leader of the mutin , and
had now shown himself the most ejected and dispiri of all
the rest came walking towards them, with two more of the
crew: the captain was meager at having this principal rogue
so much in his power, that ie could hardly have patience to

let him come so near as to be sure of him, for they only "

heard his ton e before; but when they came nearer, the cap-
tain and Fri ay, startin up on their feet, let fly at them.
The boatswain was kille upon the spot; the next man-was
shot in the body, and fell just b him, though he did not die
till an hour or two after; and t e third run for it. At the
noise of the fire, I immediately advanced with my whole army,
which was now eight men, viz. myself, generalissimo ; Frida ,
my lieutenant-general ; the captain an his two men, and
three prisoners of war, whom we had trusted with arms. We
came upon them, indeed, in the dark, so that thefiould not
see our number; and I made the man they had lelt in the
boat, who was now one of us, to call them by name, to try if]
could bring them to a arley, and so might perha 3 reduce
them to terms; which ell out just as we desned; or indeed
it was easy to think, as their condition then was, they would
be very willing tocapitulate. So he calls out as l as he
could, to one of them, " Tom Smith! Tom Smith 7 Tom
Smith answered immediately, "Is that Robinson?" ' For it
seems he knew the voice. The other answered, " Av, ay ; fir
God's sake, Tom Smith, throw down your arms and yield, or
you are all dead men this moment."----" Whom must we yield
to? Where are they '! " says Smith in. " Here they are,"
says he; " here's our captain, and fly men with him have
been hunting you these two hours; the boatswain is killed,
Will Fry is wounded. and I am a prisoner; and if you do not
yield on are all lost."--" Will the gimus quarter, then 7."
says om Smith, " and we will i d. 'J'I'll go and ask, if

you know my voice; if you lay down your arms immediately,
and submit, you shall have your lives all but Will Atkins."

Upon this Will Atkins cried out, " For God's sake captain,
give me quarter; what have I done? They have all been as

ad as 1;" which, by the way, was not true neither ' for, it
seems, this "'ill Atkins was the first man that laid hold of the
captain, when they first mutinied, and used him barbarously,
in tying his hands, and giving him injurious language. How-
ever, the captain told him he must lay down his arms at dis-
cretion, and trust to the governor'smercy; by which he meant
Inc, for they all called me overnor. In a word, they all laid
down their arms, and begge their lives; and I sent the man that
had parleyed with them, and two more, who bound them all;
and then my great arm'.' of fifty men, "hich, particularly with
those three, were in all but ei-rht, came up and seized upon
them, and upon their boat; onTy that I kept myself and one
more ouLof sight for reasons of state.

Our next work was to repair the boat, and think of seizing
the ship; and as for the captain, now he had leisure to parley
with them, he expostulated with them upon the villany of their
practices with him, and at length upon the further wickedness
of their design, and how certainly it must brin'r them to miser
and distress in the end, andperhaps to the "allows. They
appeared very enitent, and begged hard {gr their lives As
for that, he toldp them they were none of his prisoners, but the
commander's of the island; that they thought they had set
him on shore in a barren, uninhabited island; but it had
pleased God so to direct them, that it was inhabited, and that
the overnor was an Envrlishman; that he might hang them
all t ere, if he pleased; .but as he had given them all quarter,
he supposed he would send them to England, to be dealt with
there as EEusttce required, except Atkins, whom he was como
manded y the governor to advise to prepare for death, for
that he would be Iran d in the mornin .

Though this was but a fiction offitis own, yet it had its
desired efl'ect: Atkins fell upon his knees to be r the captain
to intercede with the governor for his lilie; an all the rest
hearged of him, for God's Sake, that they might not he sent
to nuglaml.

It now occurred to me, that the time of our deliverance was
Come, and that it would he :1 most easy thing to bring these
fellows in to he hearty in gettinu' possession: of the ship ; so I
retired in the dark iron: them that they might not see what
kind of a rovcrnor they had), and called the captain to me.
when I ca ed, as at a good distance, one of the men was or-
dered to speak again, and say to the captain, " Captain, the
commander calls for you; " and presently the captain re-
plied, " Tell his excellency I am 'ust a coming." ' his more
perfectly amazed them, and they all believed that the command-
er was just by with his fifty men. Upon the captain's coming
to me, I told him my project for seizing the ship, which he
liked wonderfully well, and resolved to put it in execution the
next morning. But, in order to execute it with more art, and
to be secure of success, I told him we must divide the prison-
ers, and that he should go and take Atkins, and two more of
the worst of them, and send them )inioned to the cave where
the others lay. This was committal to Friday, and the two men
who came on shore with the captain. They conveyed them
to the cave, as to a prison ; and it was, indeed, a dismal place,
especially to men In their condition. The others I ordered
to my bower 8&8 I called it), of which I have given a full de-
scription; an as it was fenced in, and they pinioned, the

lace _was secure enough, considering they were upon their
inner.

To these, in the morning,I sent the captain, who was to
enter into a parley with them; in a word, to tr them, and tell
me whether he thought they might be trusted, or no to go on
hoard and surprise the ship. He talked to them of the injury
done him, of the condition they were brought to, and that,
though the governor had given them quarter for their lives as
to the present action, yet that if they were sent to En land
they would all be hanged in chains, to be sure; but tiat iiz
they would join in so Just an attempt as to recover the ship,
he would have the governor's engagement for their pardon.w",

76 aonmsoa causes.

Any one may guess how readily such a roposal would be
accepted by men in their condition: they ell down on tleir
knees to the captain, and promised, with the deepest impre-
cations, that they would be faithful to him to the last drop,
and that they should owe their lives to him, and would go with
him all over the World; that they would own him as a father
as lon-r as they lived. " Well," says the captain, " I must go
and tell the governor what you say, and see what 1 can do to
bring him to consent to it." So he brought me an account of
the temper he found them in, and that he verily believed the{
would be faithful. However, that we mi PM he very secure,
told him he should 0 back again and c oose out those five,
and tell them, that t ey might see he did not want men, that
he would take out those five to be his assistants, and that the
governor would keep the other two, and the threethat were
sent prisoners to the castle Silly cave) as hostages for the fidel-
ity of those five; and that i they proved unfaithful in the ex-
ecutiou, the five hostages should be hanged in chains alive on
the shore. This looked severe, and convinced them that the

overnor was in earnest: however, they had no way left them

ut to accept it; and it was now the business of the risoners,
as much as of the captain, to persuade the other ve to do
their duty. ' .

Our strength was now thus ordered for the expedition: first,
The captain, his mate, and passenger; second, Then the two
prisoners of the first ang, to whom, havtng their character
from the captain, I has given their liberty and trusted them
with arms; third, The other two that I had kept till now In
my bower pinioned, but, on the ca tain's motion, had now re-
leased; fourth, These five release at last; so that they were
twelve in all, besides five we kept prisoners in the cave for
hostages.

I asked the captain if he was willing to venture with these
mods on bowl the ship; but as for me and my man Friday,
I did not think it was proper for us to stir, having seven men
left behind; and it was em loyment enough for us to keep
them asunder, and supply t m with victuals. As to the fire5,5

in the cave, I resolved to kee them fast, but Friday went in
twice a day to them, to supp y them with necessaries; and I
made the other two carry provisions to a certain distance,
where Friday was to take it. . A

pleasure they should not stir any where but by my direction;
that if they did, they would be fetched into the castle, and be
laid in irons; so that, as we never sulfered them to see me as a
governor, I now appeared as anot er person, and spoke of the
governor, the garrison, the cas e, and the like, upon all
occasions. _

The captain now had no difiiculty before him, but to furnish
his two boats, stop the breach of one, and man them. He
made his passenger captain of one, with four of the men; and
himself, his mate, and five more, went in the other; and they
contrived their business very well, for they came up to the
ship about midniwht. As soon as they came within call of the
ship, he made Isobinson hail them, and tell them they had
brought 06' the men and the boat but that it was a long time
before they had found them, and the like, holding them in a
chat till they came to the shi 's side; when the captain and
the mate entering first, with t eir arms, immediately knocked
down the second mate and carpenter With the butt end of their
muskets, being very faithfully seconded by their men: they
secured all the rest that were upon the main and quarter-
decks, and began to fasten the hatches, to keep them down
that were below; when the other boat and their men, entering
at the forechains, secured the forecastle of the ship, and the
scuttle which went down into the cook-room, making three.
men they found there prisoners. When this was done, and
all safe upon deck, the captain ordered the mate, with three
men, to break into the round-house, where the new rebel cap-
tain lay, who, havin taken the alarm, had map, and, With

As soon as the slti D was thus secured, the captaitt ordered
seven guns to be lireill, which was the si ial agreed upon with
me to give me notice of his success, which you may be sure
I was very glad to hear, having sat watching upon the shore
for It till near two o'clock in the morning. Having thus
lteard the signal plainly, I laid me down; and it having been
a day ol' great lati-rtte to me,l slept very sound, till I was
something surprised with the noise of a gun; and presently
starting up,l heard a titan call me by the name ol'" Governor,
governor," and presently I knew the captain's voice; when,
climbing up to the top ol'the hill. there lie stood, and pointing
to the ship, he embraced me in his arms. " My dear friend
and deliverer," says he, "there's your shit, liir slte is all
yours, and so are we, and all that belong to tor." 1 cast my
eyes to the ship, and there she rode within little more. than
hall'a tttile ol' the shore; tor they had weighed her anchor as
soon as they were masters of her, and the weather being fair,
had brought her to an anchor just against the mouth of the
little creel; : and the tide being tip, the captain had brought
the pinnaee itt near the i-lace where l at lirst landed my rafts,
and so landed just at my door. I was at lirst ready to sink
down with the surprise; for I saw my deliverance, indeed,
visibly put into my hands, all things easy, aml a large ship
iust ready to carry me away whitlter l pleased to go. At
lirst, for some time, I was not able to answer ltitn one word;
but as he had taken me in his arms. I held fast by him, or I
should have fallen to the ground. He perceived the surprise,
lud immediately pulls a. bottle out of his pocket, and gave me

a dram of cordial, which he had hrou ht on purpose for me.
After I had drank it, I sat down upon t ie ground; and thou 'h
it brought me to myself, yet it was a good while before I cou d
speak a word to him. All this time the poor man was in as
great an ecstasy as I, only not under any surprise, as I was;
and he said a thousand kind and tender thin-rs to me, to com-
pose and bring me to myself; but such was the flood ol'jny in
my breast, that it put all my spirits into confusion; at last it
broke out into tears; and in a little while after I recovered my
Speech. 1 then took my turn, and embraced him as my de-
bverer, and we rejoiced towethor. I told him 1 looked upon
him as a man sent from Hiaven to deliver me, and that the
whole transaction seemed to be a chain of wonders; that such
things as these were the testimonies we had of a secret hand
of Providence governing the World, and :m evidence that the
eye of an infinite 'ower could search into the remotest corner
of the world, an send help to the miserable whenever he
pletsed. I forgot not to hit up my heart in thankfulness to
[e wen; and what heart could forbear to bless him, who had
not only in a miraculous manner provided lbr me in such a
wilderness, and in such a desolate condition, but front whom
every deliverance must always be acknowledged to proceed.
When we had talked a while, the ca tain told me he had
brought me some little refreshment, suc t as the ship afforded,
and such as the wretches that had been so long his masters
had not lundered him of. Upon this be called aloud to the
boat, and, bade his men bring the things ashore that were for
the governor; and, indeed, It was a present as if I had been
one that was not to be carried away with them, but as if I had
been to dwell upon the island still. First, he had brought me
a case of bottles full of excellent cordial waters, six large bottles
"of Madeira wine (the bottles held two quarts each), two 'iounds
of excellent good tobacco, twelve good pieces of the ship 5 beef,
and six pieces of pork, with a bag of peas, and about a Imu-
dred weight of biscuit: he'also brou ht me a box of sugar, 3
box of flour, a. full of lemons, an two bottles of lime nice,
and abundance other things. But. besides these, whatiton'msox censors. 281

was athousand times more useful to me, he brought me six
new elean shirts, six very good neckcloths, two pair of gloves,
one air ofshoes, a hat, and one air of stockings, with a very

00 suit ofclothes of his own, w rich had been worn but very
itth; in a word, he clothed me from head to foot. It was a
very kind and agreeable present, as any one may imagine, to
one in my circumstances; but never was any thing in the world
ol'that kind so un lcasant, awkward, and uneasy, as it was te
me to Wear such c othes at first.

After these ceremonies were past, and after all his good
things were brought into my little apartment, we began to
consult what was to be dorm with the prisoners we had ; lbr it
was worth considering whether we might venture to take then-1
away with us or no, especially two of them, whom he knew to
he incorrigible and refractory to the last degree; and the cap-
tain said he knew they were such rogues, that there was no
obliging them; and ifhe did carry' them away, it must he in
"Irons, as malcfactors, to be delivered over tojustice at the first
English colony he could come at; and I found that the captain
himself was very anxious about it. Upon this I told him, that
if he desired it, I would undertake to bring the two men he
spoke of to make it their own request that he should leave them
upon the island. "I should be very glad of that," says the
captain, " with a}! my heart."--" well," says I, " I will send
for them up, and talk with them for you." So I caused Fri-
day and the two hostages,-----fer they were now discharged, their
comrades having performed their promise ;----I say, {caused
them to go to the cave, and bring up the five men, pinioned
as they were, to the bower, and keep them there till i came.
After some time, i came thither dressed in my new habit; and
new 1 was called governor again. Being all met, and the ca .
min with me, 1 caused the men to be brought before me, an I
told them I had got a full account of their villainous behavior
to the captain, and how they had run away with the ship. and
were preparing to commit further robberies, but that Provuience
had eosnared them in their own ways, and that they were

failen into the pig'r'hich they had dug for others. I let them233 nonmsoa' ekusoi'.

know that by my direction the ship had been seized; that she
lay now in the road; and they might see, by and by, that theil
new captain had received the reward of his villany, and that
they would see hitu hanging at the yard-arm; that as to them.
I wanted to know what they had to say why lshould not exwun:
them as pirates, taken in the fact, as by my commission they
could not doubt but 1 had authority so to do.

One ol'them aus'Wered in the name ol'the rest, that they had
nothing to say but this, that when they were taken, the captain
promised them their lives, and they humbly implored my mer-
cy. But I told them I knew not what mercy to show them;
tor as tor myself, I had resolved to quit the island with all my
men, and had taken passage with the captain to gt) lhr ling-
land; and as for the captain, he could not carry them to Eng-
land other than as prisoners, in irons, to be tried liur mutiny,
and running awa with the ship; the consmptence of which,
they must needs know, would be the gallows; :to that I could
not tell what was best for them, unless they had a mind to take
their fate in the island; il'they desired that, as I had liberty to
leave the island, I had some inclination togive them their lives,
il'they thought they could shift on shore. They seemed very
thankful tor it, autl said they would umch rather venture to stay
there than be carried to England to be hanged: so l left it on
that issue.

However, the captain seemed to make some ditliculty of it,
as if he durst not leave them there. Upon this I seemed a
little angry with the ca tain, and told him that they were my
prisoners, not his; an that seeing] had ofl'ered them so much
tavor, I would be as good as m ' word; and that if he did not
think lit to consent to it, I would set them at liberty, as I lbund
them; and it" he did not like it, he might take them again it'
he could catch them. Upon this they appeared very thankful,
and I accordingly set them at liberty, and bade them retire
into the woods to the place whence they came, and I would
leave them'some fire-arms, some ammunition, and some direc-
tions how they should live very well, if the thourrht fit. Upon
this I prepared to go on board the ship; at told the captain
I would stay that night to prepare my things, and desired him
to go on board, in the mean time, and keep all right in the
ship, and send the heat on shore next day for me; ordering
him. at all events, to cause the new captain, who was killed, to
be hanged at the yard-arm, that these men might. see him.

When the captain was gone, I sent for the men up to me to
my apartment, and entered seriously into discourse with them
on their circumetancm. i told them I thoughtthey had made
'a ri'rht choice; that if the captain had carried them away,t|tcy
woucld certainly he hanged. I showed them the new captain
hanging at the yard-arm of the ship, and told them they had
nothing lose to (:xm'c-L

When they hat all declared their willingness to stay, 1 then
told them 5. Would let them into the story of my living there,
and put them into the way oftnaking it easy to them; accord-
ingly, I gave them the whole history of fireplace, and of my
earning to it; showed them my firrtilieations, the way I made
my bread, planted my core, cured my grapes; and, in a word,
':.-.ll that, was necessary to make them easy. I told them the
:'<<'tnt'_\' also ot'the seventeen Spaniards that were to beexpected.
t'u- whom I left a letter, and made them promise to treat them
in common with themselves. Here it may be noted, that the
atttpttu'n had ink on board, who was greatly sur rised that!
mover hit upon a way of making ink of charm and water,
or ut'something else, as i had done things much more difiicult.

i left them my fire-arms, viz. five muskets, three fowlingv
pieces, and three swords. I had above a, barrel and a half of
:powder left; for after the first year or two, I used but little,
and wasted none. I ave them a description of the way I
managed the oats, an directions to milk and fatten them, and
:to make both n-tter and cheese: in a word,l gave them everg
part of my own story; and told them I should prevail wit
the captain to leave them two barrels of gun )owder more, and
some uarden seeds, which I told them I won d have been very
'Ilitli of: alsol gave them the ha of as which the ca Lain

Triad brought me to eat, and bade t em sure to sow m m--
erease them.234 - summon CRUSOE.

Having done all this, I left them the next day, and went on
board the ship. We prepared immediately to sail, but did
not weigh that night. The next morning early, two of the
five men came swinnniug to the ship's side, and makinga most
lamentable complaint of the other three, begged to be taken
into the ship, for God's sake, for they should be murdered, and
begged the captain to take them on board, though he hanged
them immediately. Upon this, the ca tain pretended to have
no power without me; but after some illzieulty, and alter their
solemn promises of amendment, they were taken on board, and
were some time after soundly whipped and pickled; after
which they proved very honest and quiet fellows.

Some time alter this, the boat was ordered on shore, the
tide being up, with the things promised to the men; to which
the captain, at my intercession, caused their chests and clothes
to be added, which they took, and were very thankful for. I:
also encouraged them, by telling them that if it lay in my
power to send.- any vessel to take them in, I would not for-
get them.

When I took leave of this island, I carried on board, for
reliques,-the great goat-skin cap I had made, my umbrella,
and one of my parrots; also I lorgot not to take the money I
formerly mentioned, which 'had lain by me so long useless, that
it was grown rusty or tarnished, and could hardl ' pass for sil-
ver, till it had been a little robbed and handled; as also the-
money I lbund in the wreck of the Spanish sh' And thus
I left the island, the 19th of December, 1131 than by the ship's
account, in the year 1666, after I had been upon it eight and
twenty years, two months, and nineteen da s; being delivered
from this second captivity the same day 0 the "Ninth that I
fist made my escape in the long-boat, from arm the Moors
of Sallee. In this vessel, after a long voyage, arrived in
England the 11th of June, in the year 1687, having been thirty--
Iive 'ears absent.

was alive, but had had great misfortunes in the world; was
become a widow the second time, and very low in the world.
I made her very easy as to what she owed me, assuring her I
would give her no trouble; but on the contrary, in ratitudc
for her former care and litithfulness to me,l. reliever her as
my little stock \vould ali'ord; which, at that time, would in-
deed allow me to do but little {or her; but lassured her 1 would
never lbrget her former kindness to me; nor did 1 forwet her
when I had suliicient to help her, as shall be observed in its

roper place. {went down afterwards into Yorkshire; but my
liither was dead, and my mother and all the family extinct, ex-
cept that I found two sisters, and two ofthe children ofone of
my brothers; and as I had been long ago given over for dead,
there had been no provision made lbr me; so that, in a word,
I found nothing to relieve or assist me; and that the little
money I had would not do much for me as to settling in
the world.

I met with one piece of gratitude, indeed, which I did not
expect; and this was, that the master of the ship whom I had
so happily delivered, and by the same means saved the ship
and cargo, having given a very handsome account to the own-
ers of the manner how I had saved the lives of the men, and
the ship, they invited me to meet them, and some other
merchants concerned, and all together made me a very hand-
some compliment upon the subject, and a present of almost
$200 sterling.

But after making several reflections u on the circumstances
of my life, and how little way this word: go towards settling
me in the \vorld,I resolved to go to Lisbon, and see if I might
not come by some information of the state of my plantation in
the Brazils, and of what was become of my partner, who, i
had reason to suppose, had some years past given me over lhr
dead. "With this vimvl took shipping for Lisbon. where l
arrived in April following; my man Friday zuscompanying
me very honestly in all these ramblings, and proving a most
faithful servant upon all occasions. When I came to Lisbon.
1 found out, by inquiry, and to my particular satisfaction, my286 ttomxsox ('rtU'soe

old friend the captain of the ship who first took me u at sea
otl'the shore of Africa. He was now grown old, and tad left
oll'going to sea, having put his son, who was far from a young
man, into his ship, and who still used the Brazil trade. The
bid titan did not know me; and, indeed, I hardly knew him;
but I soon brought him to my remembrance, and as soon
llirought myself to his remembrance, when I told him who

Alter some passionate expressions of the old acquaintance
between us, I inquired, you may be sure, after my plantation
and my partner. The old man told me he had not been in
the Braztls for about nine years; but that he could assure me,
that when he came away, my partner was living; but the trus-
tees, whom I had joined with him to take cognizance of my
part, were both dead; that, however, he believed Iwould have
a very good account of the improvement of the plantation; for
that upon the general belief of my being cast away and
drowned, my trustees had given in the account of the produce
of my part of the plantation to the procurator-fiscal, who had
appropriated it, in case I never came to claim it, one third to
the king, and two thirds to the monastery of St. Augustine, to
be expended for the benefit of the poor, and for the conversion
of the Indians to the Catholic faith; but that if I appeared, or
any one for me, to claim the inheritance, it would be restored;
on y that the improvement or annual production, being dis-
tributed'to charitable uses, could not be restored; but he
assured me that the steward of the king's revenue from lands,

partner, gave every year a faithful account of the pgoduce, of

grown exceeding rich upon the enjoying his part of it; and
that, to the best of his remembrance, he had heard that the
king's third ofmy part, which was, it seems, granted away to
some other monastery or religious house, am unutcd to above
two hundred moidores a year; that as to my being restored to
a quiet possession ol'it, there was no question to he maths of
that, m ' partner being alive to witness my title, and my mune
being so enrolled in the register of the country: also he told
me, that the survivors of my two trustees were very fair, honest
people, and very wealthy; and he believed I would not only
lave their assistance for putting me in possession, hut u'ould
find a very considerable sum ol'money in their hands For my
acdbunt, being the produce ol'the I'arm while their fathers held
the trust, and before it was given up, as above; which, as he
remembered, was tor about twelve years.

I showed myself a little concerned and uneasy at this ac-
count, and inquired of the old captain how it came to ass that
the trustees should thus dispose of my effects, when re knew
that I had made my will, and had made him, the Portuguese
ca tain, my universal heir, 6w.

IlIe told me that was tru ); but that as there was no proof
ot'my being dead, he could not act as executor, until some
certain account should come of my death; and, besides, he
was not willing to intermeddle with a thing so remote; that it
was true he had registered my will, and (It in his claim; and
could he have given any account of my ring dead or alive,
he would have acted by )rocuration, and taken possession of
the ingeino (so they cal ed the sugar-house), and have riven
his son, who was now at the Brazils, orders to do it". " ut,"
says the old man, "I have one piece of news to tell you,
which perhzt 5 may not he so acceptable to you as the rest;
and that is, elieviug you were lost, and all the world believing
so also, your partner and trustees did otfer to account with me, '
In your name, for six or eight of the first years' profits, which
I reeehfed. There being at that time great disbursements for
increasmg the wbrks, building an ingeino, and buying slaves,
it did not amount to near so much as afterwards it produced:
however," says the old man, " I shall give you a true account
of what I have received in all, and how I have disposed of it."

After a few days' further conference with this ancient friend.
he brought Illl' an account of the first six years' income of my
)litlll.tliull, signed by my partner and the merchant-trustees,
ln-ing always delivered in goods, viz. tobacco in roll, and sugar
in chests, besides rum, molasses, &c., which is the consequence
n"a sugar-work: and 1 found, by this account, that every year
the income considerably increased; but, as above, the disburse-
ments [wing large, the stun at lirst was small: however, the
old man let me see that he was debtor to me four hundred and'
seventy moidores of gold, besides sixty chests of sugar, and
fifteen double rolls of tobacco, which were lost in his ship; he
having been shi )wreeked coming home to Lisbon, about eleven
years after my raring the place. The good titan then began
to complain of his mislbrtunes, and how he had been obliged
to make use of lay money to recover his losses, and buy him
a share in a new ship. " However, my old friend," says he,
" you shall not want a so iply in your necessity; and as soon
as my son returns, you s tall be fully satisfied." Upon this
he pulls out an old pouch, aml gives me one lmndred an
sixty Portugal moidores in gold; and giving the writings of
his title to the ship, which his son was gone to the llrazl s in,
of which he was a quarter-part owner, and his son another, he
puts them both into my hands for security of the rest.

I was too much moved with the honesty and kindness of the
IOOI' man to be able to bear this; and remembering what he ,
lad done for me, how he had taken me up at sea, and how
ronerous-1y he had used me on all occasions, and particularly
low sincere a friend he was now to me, I could hardly rel'raitf
weeping at what he had said to me; therefore I ti'bked him if
his circumstances admitted him to spare so umch money at
that time, and if it would not straiten him. He told me he
could not say but it might straiten him a little; but, however,
it was my money. and I might want it more than he.

Every thing the good man said was full of Mon and I
could hardly refrain from teats while he spoke: in short, I

"I
took one hundred of the moidores, and called for a pen and
ink to give lnm a rewipt for them: then] returned him the
rest, and told him if ever l had possession of the plantation,
1 would return the other to him also (as, indeed, I afterwards
did);and that as to the hill of sale of his part in his son's
ship, I would not take it by any means; but that if l wanted
the money, I found he was honest enough to pay me; and if
1 did not, but came to receive what he gave me reason to an
poet, I would never have a penny more trom him.

When this was past, the old man asked me il'he should put
me into a method to make my claim to my plantation. I told
him I thought to go over to it myself. He said I might do so
if i pleased; but that if i did not, there were waya enou rh to
secure my right, and immediately to appropriate the re its to
my use; and as there were ships in the river of his on just
ready to go away to Brazil, he made me enter my name In a
public register, with his aliidarjt, atlirn'iinpz, upon oath, that I
was alive, and that l was the same person who took u the land
for the planting the said plantation at first. This in re --~
ularly attested hv a notary, and a procuration allixedfire i-
rected me to send it, with a letter ol'his writing, to a merchant
of his acquaintance at the place, and then prop05ed my stay-
in" with him till an account came ofthe return.

ci'lever was any thing more honorable than the proceedings
upon this procuration; for in less than seven months I re-
ceived a large packet from the survivors of my trustees, the
merchants, for whose account 1 went to sea, in which were the
following particular letters and papers inclosed.

First, There was the account-current of the produce of my
firm or plantation, from the year when their fathers had
balanced with my old Portugal ca tain, being, for six years:
the balance appeared to be one t ousand one hundred and
seventy-four moidores in my favor. .

Secondly, There was the account of four years more, While
they kept the efiects in their hands, before the government
claimed the administration, as being the effects of a person
not to be foureg, which they coiled civil death; and the bah
ance of this, the value of the plantation increasing, amounted
to. nineteen thousand four hundred and forty-six crusadoes,
bein about three thousand two hundred and forty moidores.

T irdly, There was the )rior of Augustine's account, who
had received the )rofits or above fourteen years; but not
being to account or what was dis )osed of by the hospital,
very honestly declared he had eight umdred and seventy-two
mordores not distributed, which he acknowledged to 'my ae-
eount: as to the king's part, that refunded nothing.

There was a letter of my partner's, congratulating me very
affectionately upon my being alive, giving me an account ho'w
the estate was unproved, and what it produced a f'ear; with
a particular of the number of squares or acres tiat it con-v
tained, how planted, how many slaves there were upon it, and:
making two-and-twenty crosses for blessings, told me he had
said so many Avc Marius to thank the blessed Virgin that l
was alive: inviting me very passionately to come over and.
take possession of my own; and, in the mean time, to give
him orders to whom he should deliver my elli'cts, if I did not:
come myself; concluding with a hearty tender of his friendu
Ship, and that of his family; and sent me, as a present, seven
fine leopards' skins, which he had, it seems, received from
Africa, by some other ship that he had sent thither, and who,
it seems, had made a better voyage than- L He sent me also
live" chests of excellent sweetmcat's, and a hundred pieces of
field uncoined, not quite so large as moidorcs. By the same

eet in two merchant-trustees ship )ed me one thousand two
hundred chests of sugar, eight hunt red rolls of tobacco, and
the rest of the whole account in gold. '

1 might well say now, indeed, that the latter end of Job Was
better than the beginning. It is impossible to ex iress the
flutterings- of my ver heart when I found" all my wea th about
me; for as the Brazi ships come all in fleets, the same ships
which brought my letters brought my goods; and the effects
were safe in the river before the letters came to my hand.
in a word, I turned p e, and grew sick; and had not the old
man run and fetched me a cordial, I believe-the sudden sur-
prise ofjoy had oversct nature, and I had died upon the spot:
nay, after that, I continued very ill, and was so some hours,
till a physician being sent for, and something of the real cause
of my illness being known, he ordered me to be let blood;
after which I had relief, and grew well; but I verily believe,
if I had not been eased by a vent given in that manner to the
spirits, I should have died. 4

I was now master, all on a sudden, of above five thousand
pounds sterlin ' in money, and had an estate, as I might woll
call it, in the razils, of above a thousand pounds a year, as
sure as an estate of lands in England; and, in a word, I was
in a condition which I scarce knew how to understand, or
how to compose myself for the enjoyment of it. The first
thing Idid was to recompense my original benefactor, my good
old ca tain, who had been first charitable to me in my dis-
tress, liind to me in my beginning, and honest to me at the
end. I showed him all that was sent to me: I told him, that
next to the providence of Heaven, which disposed all things

.it was owinr to him; and that it now lay on me to reward
him, which'I would do a hundred-ibld; 501 first returned to
him the hundred moidores I had received of him; then I sent
lb: a notary, and caused him to draw up a general release or
discharge from the four hundred and seventy moidores, which
he had acknoivledged he owed me, in the fullest and firmest
manner possible; after which I caused a procuration to be
drawn, empowering him to be my receiver of the annual
profits of my plantation, and appointin my partner to ac-
count with him, and make the returns iiy the usual fleets to
him in my name; and a clause in the end, bein a grant of
one hundred moidores a year to him during his liiia, out of the
efl'ects, and fift moidores a year to his son after him, for his
life; and thus recruited my old man. '

I was now to consider which way to steer my course next,
and what to do with the estate that Providence had thus put
into my hands' and, indeed, I had more care upon my head
now than I ha in my silent state of life in the island, where I
wanted nothing but what I had, and had nothing but what I
wanted '; whereas I had now a great charge upon me, and
my business was how to secure it. I had no cave now to hide
my money in, or a )lace where it mi ht lie without lock or
key, till it grew mon dy and tarnished fore any body would
meddle with it: on the contrary, I knew not where to put it,
or whom to trust with it. M y old patron, the captain, indeed,
was honest, and that was the only refuge I had. In the next
place, my interest in the Brazils seemed to summon me thith-
er; but now 1 could not tell how to think of going thither till I
had settled my affairs, and left my effects in some safe hands
behind me. At first lthought of my old friend the widow,
who I knew was honest, and would be just to me; but then
she was in years, and but poor and, for aught I knew, might
be in debt; so that, in a word, i had no way but to go back to
England myself, and take my etfects with me.

It was some months, however, before I resolved it on this;
and therefore, as I had rewarded the old captain ful y, and to
his satisfaction who had been my former benefactor, so I be-
gan to think of my poor widow, whose husband had been my"
hrst benefactor, and she, while it was in her power my faith-
ful steward and instructor. So the first thin Idid lgota
merchant in Lisbon to write to his correspom ent in London,
not only to pay a bill, but to go find her out, and carry her in
money a hundred pounds from me, and to talk with her, and
comfort her in her poverty, by telling her she should, if I
lived, have a further supply : at the same time I sent my two
sisters in the country a hundred pounds each, they being,
though not in want, yet not in very good circumstances; one
havin been married and left a widow; and the other havin
a lms )and not so kind to her as he should be. But among afi
my relations or acquaintances,l could not yet itch u on one
to whom I durst commit the gross of my stock, that might
go away to the Brazils, and leave things safe behind me; and
this greatly perplexed me. ,

[had once a mind to have gone to the Bflzils, and have
settled myself there, for I was, as it were, naturalized to
place; but I had some little scruple in my mind about relig' n,
which insensibly drew me back. However, it was not re-
ligion that kept me from going there for the resent; and as I
had made no scru le of being openly of tie religion of the
country all the wh' e I was among them, so neither did I yet;
only that, now and then, having of late thonglit more of it
than formerly, when I began to think of living and dying
amon them, I began to regret my having irofessed my-
self a apist, and thought it might not be the st relighn to
die with. .

But, as I have said, this was not the main thing that kept
me from going to the Brazils, but that really I did not know
with whom to leave'my etfects behind me; so I resolved, at
last, to o to England with it, where, if I arrived, I concluded
I slioul make some acquaintance, or find some relations that
would be faithful to me; and, accordingly, I prepared to go
to England with all my wealth.

In order to prepare things for my going home, I first, the
Brazil fleet being just going away, resolved to give answers
suitable to the just and faithful account of thin s I had from
thence; and, first, to the prior of St. Augustine wrote a let-
ter full of thanks for their just dealings, and the offer of the
eight hundred and seventy-two moidores which were undis-
posed of, which I desired might be given. five hundred to the
monastery, and three hundred_and seventy-two to the poor,
as the prior should direct; desiring the good padre's prayers
for me, and the like. [wrote next a letter of 'thanks to my
two trustees, with all the acknowledgment that so much jusn
um and honesty called for; as for sending them any present,
they were far above having any occasion for it. Lastly, I
wrote to my artner, acknowledging his industry in the im-
proving the p antation, and his integrity in increasing the
stock of the works; giving him instructions for his future gov-
ernment of my part, according to the powers I had left with
my old patron, to whom I destred him to send whatever be-
came due to. _'_ till he should hear from rue more partic-

ly; assuring in that it was my intention not .only to
to him, but to'settle myself there for the remainder of{I '-

my life. To this I added a very handsome iresent of some
Italian silks for his wife and two daughters, or such the cap-
tain's son informed me he had; with two pieces of line En lish
broadcloth, the best I could get in Lisbon, five pieces of b ack
baize, and some Flanders lace of a good value.

IIavin thus settled my ati'airs, sold my cargo, and turned
all m ' e ects into good bills of exchange, my next difficulty

'was, which way to go to England: I li-d been accustomed

enough to the sea, and yet I had a strange aversion to go to
England by sea at that time; and though I could give no
reason for it, yet the ditliculty increased upon me so much,
that though I had once shi )ped my baggage in order to go,
yet I altered my mind, an that not once, but two or three
tunes.

It is true, I had been very unfortunate by sea, and this
might be some of the reasons; but let no man slight the strong
impulses of his own thoughts in cases of such moment: two
of the ships which I had singled out to go in--I mean more
particularly singled out than any other, having put my thin s
on board one ofthcm, and in the other to have agreed with tfie
captain--I say, two of these ships miscarried, viz. one was
taken by the Algerines, and the other was cast away on the
Start, near 'I'orbay, and all the people drowned except three;
so that in either of those vessels I had been made miserable.

Having been thus harassed in my thoughts my old pilot
(to whom I communicated every thing) ressed me earnestly
not to go by sea, but either to go by Jan to the Groyne, and
cross over the Ba of Biscay to Rochelle, from whence It was
but an eas an safe journey by land to Paris, and so to
Calais and over; or to go up to Madrid, and so all the way
by land through France. In a word,I was so prepossessed
against my gomg by sea at all, except from Calais to Dover,
that I resolved to travel all the way by land; which, as I was
not in haste, and did not value the charge, was by much the
pleasanter way -_ and to make it more so, my old captain

rought an Eng ish gentleman, the son of a merchan mil

bon, who was Willing to travel with me; after i 'c

5 .
Felted up two more English merchants also, and two you"
ortuguese gentlemen, the last going to Paris only; sothat
in all there were six of us, and five servants; the two men-
chants and the two Portuguese contenting themselves with
one servant between two, to save the charge; and as for me,
I got an English sailor to travel with me as a servant, bdsides

my man Friday, who was too much a stranger to be capable _ '

of supplying the place of a servant on the road.

In t as mannerI set out from Lisbon; and our company

being very well mounted and armed, we made a 'little troop,
whereof they did me the honor to call me captain, as well be-
cause I was the oldest man, as because I had two servants,
and, indeed, was the original of the whole journey. .

As I have troubled you with none of my sea Journals, so!
shall trouble he" now with none of my land journal; but some
adventures t at happened to us in this tedious and "col
journey I must not omit.

When we came to Madrid, we, being all of us stran rs to
Spain, were Willing to stay some timeto seethe court of sin,
and to see what was worth observing; but it beingtbe alter
part of the summer. we hastened away, and set out from Ma-
drid about the middle of October; but when we calm to the
edge of Navarre, we were alarmed, at several towns on the
away, with an account that so much snow was fallen on the
French side of the mountains, that several travellers were
obliged to come back to Pampeluna, afiel- haeing attempted,
at an extreme hazar to pass on. _ .

When we came to ampeluna-itsell', wefound .rt somdeed;
and tome, that had been always used to a hot climate, and to
countries where .I could scarce bear any dothg on, the cold
was insufi'erable; nor, indeed, was it more &ainful .than sur-
prising, to come but ten days before out of d Gastric, where
the weather was not onlygvarm, but very hot, and unmedrately
to feel a wind from the y-renean mountains so very keen'oo
severely cold, so to be intolerable, and to-endanger henumhmg

"our inday was .se y frightened when'hs saw the moun-

tairis all covered with snow, and felt cold weather, which he
had never seen or felt before in his life. To mend the matter,
when we came to Pat eluna, it continued snowing with so
much violence, and so Lg. that the people said wmter was
come before its time; and the roads, which were ditiicult be-
fore, were now quite impassable; for, in a word, the snow lay
in some places too thick for us to travel, and being not hard
frozen, as is the case in the northern countries, there was no
going without being in danger of being buried alive every
step. We staid no less than twent ' days at Pampeluna; when,
seeing the winter coming on, an no likelihood of its bem

better--for it was the severest winter all over Europe that hag
been known in the memory of lMll-I proposed that we should
all go away to Fontarahia, and there take shipping for Bour-
deaux, which was a very little vomge. But while 1 was con--
sidering this, there came in four French rentlemen, who, hay--
ing been stopped on the French side of t 1e asses, as we were
on the Spanish, had found out a guide, w 10, traversing the
country near the head. of Lar ruedoc, had brought them over:
the mountains by such ways, t rat they were not much incom-
moded with the snow; for where they met with snow in any
quantity, they said it was frozen hard enough to bear them
and their horses. we sent for this guide, who told us he
would undertake to carry us the same way with no hazard:
from the snow, provided we were armed sufficiently to- )ro~
tect ourselves from wild' beasts; " For," he- said, " upon t esc
great snows it was frequent for some wolves to show them-
selves at the foot of the mountains, being made ravenous for
want of food, the round being covered wrth snow." We told!
him we were w enough prepared for such creatures as
they were,.if he would ensure us from a kind of two-l 'gedl
volt'es, which, we were told, we were in most danger eit'iom

especially on the French side of the mountains. He satisfied
as that there was no danger of that kind in the way that we-
were to 0: so we readily agreed to follow him, as did also
twelve r gentlemen, with their servants, some Even?
W7
some Spanish, who, as I said, had attempted to go, andzere
obliged to come back again.

Accordingly, we set out from Pampeluna, with our guide,
on the 15th of November; and, indeed, I was surprised, when,
Instead of going forward, he came directly bac with us on
the same road that we came from Madrid, about twenty
miles; when, haviii passed two rivers, ahd come into the
plain country, we ound ourselves in a warm climate again,

. where the country was pleasant, and no snow to be seen; but
on a sudden, turnin to his left, he ap roached the mountains
another way; and t ough it is true t e hills and precipices
looked dreadful, yet he made so many tours, such meanders
and led us by such winding ways, that we insensibly passed
the height of the mountains without bein much encumbered
with the snow; and, all on a sudden, he s owed us the pleas-
ant fruitful provinces of Languedoc and Gascony, all green
an flourishin , though, indeed, at a great distance, and we
had some rou way to pass still.

We were a ittle uneas , however, when we found it snowed
one whole day and a iiig it so fast that we could not travel;
but he bid us be easy; we should soon be past it all: we
found, indeed, that we began to descend every day, and to
come more north than before; and so, depending upon our
guide, we went on. .

It was about two hours before night, when, our guide being
something before us, and not just in sight, out rushed three
monstrous Wolves, and afier them a bear, out of a hollow way
adjoining to a thick wood: two of the wolves made at the
guide, and had he been far before us, he would have been de-
voured before we could have helped him; one of them fast:
ened upon'his horse, and the other attacked the man with
that violence, that he had not time, or presence of mind
enough, to draw his pistol, but hallooed and cried out to .us
most lustily. My man Friday, being next me, I bade .him
ride up, and see what was the matter. As soon as Friday

'ane in sight of the man, he hallooed out as loud as theotlier,

N. 0 master! 0 master!" but, like a bold fellow, rode directly
up" the poor man, and with his pistol shot the wolf that at-
tached him in the head.

It was happy for the (poor man that it was mp man Frida ;
for he having been use to such creatures in lis country, 0
had no fear upon him, but went close up to him and shot him,
as above; whereas any other of us would have fired at a far-
ther distance, and' have perhaps either missed the wolf, or en-
dangered shooting the man.

But it was enough to have terrified a holder man than I;
and indeed, it alarmed all our company, when, with the noise '
of Friday's pistol, we heard on both sides the most disma
howling of wolves; and the noise, redoubled by the echo of the
mountains, a ipeared to us as if there had been a prodigious
number of t rem; and perhaps there was not sucr a few as
thit we had no cause of apprehensions; however, as Friday
had killed this wolf, the other that had fastened upon the horse
left him inunediately and lied, without doing him any dam-

e, harin hap ily fastened upon his head, where the bosses
o the bri e ha stuck in his teeth. But the man was most
hurt; for the r ing creature had hit him twice, once in the
arm, and the otter time a little above his knee; and though
he had made some defence, he was 'ust as it were tumblin
down, by the disorder of his horse, w en Friday came up and
shot the wolf.

It is eas to suppose that at the noise of Friday's pistol we
all mendedv our ace, and rode up as fast as the way, which
was very difficult), would give us leave, to see what was the
matter. As soon as we came clear of the trees, which blinded
us before, we saw clearly what had been the case, and how
Friday had disengaged the poor guide, thou h we did not
presently discern what kind of creature it was e had killed.

But never was a fight managed so hardily, and in such a
surprising manner, as that which followed between Friday and
the bear, which gave us all (though at first we were surprised
and afrad for him) the greatest diversion imaginable. A
the bear is a heavy, clumsy creature, and does not gallop .

the wolf does, who III wift and light, so he has two particnlfi

I
qualities. which generally are the rule of his actions: 6* as
to men, who are not his proper prey (he does not usuallynt-
tempt them, exce t they first attack him, unless he be exces-
sive hungry, whic it is probable might now be the case, the
ground being covered with snow), if you do not meddle with
im, he will not meddle with (you; but then you must take
care to be very civil to him, an give him the road lbr he is a
verynice gentleman; he will not go a. step out of his way for
a rince' nay, if you are really afraid, your best way is to
100 ano er way, and keep going on; for sometimes if you
stop, and stand still and look steadfastly at him, he takes it
for an afi'ront; but ill you throw or toss any thing at him and it
hits him (though it were but a bit of stick as big as your user),
he thinks himself abused, and sets all other business asi e to
ursue his revenge, and will have satisfaction in gm of
nor ;---this is lns first quality: the next is, if he once
ati'ronted, he will never leave you, night nor day, till he has
{215' revenge, but follows, at a good round rate, till be over-
es you.

My man Friday had delivered our ids and when we came
up to him, he was helping him 0 his horse--for the man
was both hurt and frightened--when, on a sudden, we'espied
the bear come out of the wood; and a vast monstrous one it
was, the biggest by far that ever I saw. We. were all a little
surprbed when we saw him; but when Friday saw him, it
was easy to see joy and courage in the fellow's countenance:
"0, 0, 0!" says Friday, three times pointing to him; "0
master! you give me te leave, me shakee to hand With him;
me makee you good laugh."

I was sur rised to see the fellow so well pleased: " You
fool," an s , " he will eat you up."---"'Eatee me u _! eatee
me up!' says Friday, twice over again; " meeatee up;
me makee you ood augh; you all stayhere, me showyou v

The bear was walking softly on, and offered to meddle with
nobody, till Friday, coming pretty near, calls to him, as if the
bear could understand him-" Hark ye, hark ye," says Friday,
" me speakee with you." We followed at a distance; for now
being come down on the Gascony side of the mountains, we
were entered a vast, great thrust, where the country was plain
and pretty 0 n, thou h it had many trees in it scattered here
and there. 'riday, w to had, as we say, the heels of the bear
came up with him finickly, and takes upI a great stone an,_
throws it at him, an hit him just on the sad, but did him no
more harm than if he had thrown it against a wall' but it an-
swered Friday's end, for the rogue was so void of fear that he
did it purely to make the bear tollow him, and show us some
laugh, as he called it. As soon as the bear felt the blow, and
saw him, he turns about, and comes after him, taking devilish
long strides, and shuffling on at a strange rate, so as would
have put a horse to a middling gallo : away runs Friday, and
takes his course as if he run towar s as for help; so we all
resolved to fire at once upon the bear, and deliver my man:
though I was angry at him heartily for bringing the hear back
upon us, when he was going about his own business another
way; and es ially I was angry that he had turned the bear
upon us, an then run away; and I called out, " You dog, ta
this your making us laugh 2 Come away, and take your horse
that we may shoot the creature." -He heard me, and eri
out, " No shoot, no shoot; stand still, and you ' get much
laugh ; " and as the nimble creature ran tWo feet for the bear's
one, he turned on a sudden, on one side of us, and seeing a x

at oak tree fit for his pnr se, he beckoned to us to ol-
ow; and doubling his pace, ie gets nimbly up the tree, lay-
ing his gun down u .n the ground, at about five or six yards
li'om the bottom of tli: tree. The bear soon came to the tree,
and we followed at a distance: the first thing he did. he

bles into the tree, climbing like a cat, though so monstrous
heavy. I was amazed at the folly,as l thought it, ofmy man,
and could not for my life see any thing to laugh at yet, till see>>
in-r the hear got up the true, we all rode near to him.
=When we came to the tree, there was 1" riday not out to the
_ small and of a large branch, and the bear got afiout half wa}r
to him. As soon as the hear got out to that part where the
linihol'the trvc was weaker,-"Ila! " says he to us. "now
you see me teachee the bear dance; " so he falls a jumping
and shaking the hough, at which the bear began to tottcr, hut
stood still, and began to look behind him, to see how he should
get back; then, indeed, we did lanrh heartily. lut Friday
. had not done with him by a great dea ; when, seeing him stand
still, he calls out to him :1 am, as if he had supposed the bear
could speak English, "SSVhat, you come no farther? pray
you come farther 2 " so he left jumping and shaking the true;
and the bear, just as ifhe understmd what he said, did come
a little Farther; then he fell a jumping again, and the hear
stopped again. We thou rht now was a good time to knock
him in the head, and cal ad to Friday to stand still, and we
would shoot the bear: but he cried out earnestly, " O pray!
0 pray! no shoot; me shoot by and then;" he would have
said by and by. However, to shorten the story, Friday
danced so much, and the hear stood so tieklish. that we had
laughing enough, but still could not imagine what the follow
would do; for first we thought he depended upon shaking the
hear off; and we found the hear was too cunning for that too;
for he would not go out far enough to be thrown down, but
clings fast with his" great hroad claws and feet, so that we
could not imagine what would he the end of it, and what the
{test would he at last. But Friday put us out of doubt. quick-
y; for seeing the bear cling last to the hough, and that he
would not be persuaded to come any farther, "Well. well."
says Friday, "you no come farther, me go; you no come to
me, me come to voug" and upon this he goes out to the
smaller end of the Bough, where it would bend with his weight,
and gently lets himself down by it, slidin down the bough, till
he came near enough to jump down on his feet, and away he
runs to his un, takes it up, and stands still. " Well," said I
to him, "lisriday, what will you do now? Why don't you
shoot him 'l "---" No shoot," says Friday, " no yet; me shoot
now, me no kill; me stay, ive you one more laugh:" and,
indeed, so he did, as you "i see presently; for when the bear
saw his enemy gone, he comes back from the bough where he
stood, but did it mighty cautiously, looking behind him every
step, and coming backward till he 0t into the body of the
tree; then, with the same hinder enfi foremost, he came down
the tree, grasping it with his claws, and moving one foot at a
time, very leisurel '. At this juncture, and just before he
could set his hind doot on the ground, Friday stepped up close
to him, clap ed the muzzle of his iece into his ear, and shot
him dead. ll'heu the rogue turned, about to see if we did not
laugh; and when he saw we were pleased, by our looks, he
falls alaughing himself very loud. "So we kill bear in my '
country," says Friday, " So you kill them 1 " saysl : " why,
you have no guns."--"No'," says he, "no un, but shoot

reat much lon arrow." This was a good iversion to us;

ut we were sti in a wild lace, and our guide ver ' much
hurt, and what to do we hardly knew: the howling o wolves
ran much in my head; and, indeed, exce t the noise I once
heard on the shore of Africa, of which I rave said somethin
already, I never heard any thing that filled me with so muci
horror.

These things, and the ap reach of ni t, called us off, or
else, as Friday would have rad us, we stould certainly have
taken the skin of this monstrous creature off, which was worth
saving; but we had near three leagues to go, and our guide
hastened us ; so we left him, and went forward on our
journey.

The ground was still cOVered with snow, though not so deep
and dangerous as on the mountains; and the ravenous creatures
as we heard afterwards, were come down into the forest an*'u mm.

Friday shooting the Benn
plain country, pressed by hunger. to seek lbr food, and had
done a great deal of mischief in the villages. where. they sur-
prised the country people. killed a great inany of their sheep
and horses, and some people too. We. had one dangerous
place to pass. which our guide told us. if there \vere more.
ooh-es in the country. we should lind them there; and this was
a small plain. surrotuuled with woods on every side. and a long.
narrow delile. or lane. which we were to pass to get through
the wood, aml then we should come to the village where we
were to lodge. It was within half an hour of sunset when we
entered the first wood, and a little alter sunset when we came
into the plain: we met with nothing in the lirst wood, except
that, in a little plain within the wood, which was not above
two l'urlongs over, we-saw live great wolves eruss the road. full
speed, one after another, as if tltey had been in chase ol~ some
prey, and had It In view; they took no notice of us. and were
gone out of sight In a flaw moments. Upon this, our guide,
who, by the way, was but a taint-hearted l'ellow, bade. tts keep
in a ready osture. liir he believed there were more wolves a
coming. e kept our arms ready, and our eyes about us;
but we saw no more woh'es till we. tame through that wood,
which was near hall'a league. and entered the plain. As soon
as we came into the plant, we had occasion enon h to look
about us; the first object we tnet with was a dead terse, that
is to say, a poor horse which the wolves had killed. and at
least a dozen ol'them at work. we conhl not say eating ol'hitn,
but picking of his bones. rather: tor thev had eaten up all the
flesh belhre. We did not think lit to disturb them at their
feast, neither did the ' take much notiee of us. Friday would
have let lly at them. lmt I would u )t sull'er him by any means;
for I found we were like to have more business upon our hands
than we were aware of. "'e were not gone hall'over the plain,
when we began to hear the wolves howl in the wood on our loll
in a frightful manner, and presently after we saw about a bun-
dred coming on directly towards us, all in a body, and most
of them in a line, as regularly as an army drawn up by expe
henced ofi'icers. I scarce knew in what manner to receive
them, but lbund to draw ourselves in a close line was the only
way; so we termed in a moment; but that we might not have
too much interval, I ordered that only every other man should
fire, and thatihe others who had not fired should stand ready
to give them a second volley immediately, if they continued to
advance upon us; and then that those who had fired at first
should not pretend to load their fusees again, but stand ready
every one With a pistol, for we were all armed with a liisee
and a pair ol'pistnls each man; so we were, by this method,
able to fire six Volleys, half of us at a time: however, at present
we had no necessity ; for upon firing the first volley, the enem
made a full stop, bein terrified as well With the noise as wit
the fire; four of them, ing shot in the head, dropped; several
others were wounded, and went bleeding of, as we could see
by the snow. I found they stopped, bugdid not immediately
retreat; whereupon, remembering that LN been told that
the fiercest creatures were terrified at the voice of a man, I
mused all the compan to halloo as loud as we could; and I
found the notion not a together mistaken: for upon our shout
the ' began to retire, and turn about. I then ordered a second
vol ey to be fired in their rear, which at them to the gallop,
and away they went to the woods. 'his gave us leisure to
charge our pieces again ; and that we might lose no time, we
kept going: but we had but little more than loaded our fast-es,
and put ourselves in readiness, when we heard a terrible neisc
in the same wood, on our lelt, only that it was farther onward,
the same way we were to go.

The ni ht was coming on, and the li ht began to be dusky,
which ma e it worse on our side; butt ie noise increasing, we
could easily perceive that it was the bowling and yelling of
those hellish creatures; and, on a sudden, we rceived two
or three troo s of wolves, one on our left one hind us, and
one in our out, so that we seemed to be surrounded With
them: however, as they did not fall upon us, we kept our way
forward, as fa; as we could tasks our horses 30, which, the
way being very rough, was only a good hard trot. In this
manner we came in view of the entrance of a wood, through
which we were to pass, at the farther. side of the plain; but
we were greatly surprised, when,_connng nearer the lane or
pass, we saw a confused number 0! wolves stand!" just at the
entrance. On a sudden, at another opening of the wood, we
heard the noise of a gun, and looking that way, out rushed a
horse, with a saddle and a bridle on him, flying like the wind,
and sixteen or seventeen wolves after him, full speed; indeed
the horse had the heels of them, but as we supposed that he
could not hold it at that rate, we doubted not but they would
get up with him at last; no question but they did.

But here we had a most horrible sight; for riding up to the
entrance where the horse came out, we found the carcasses of
another horse and of two men, devoured by the ravenous crea-
tures; and one of the men was no doubt the same whom we
heard fire the gun, for there lay a gun just by him tired off;
but as to the man, his head and the upper part of his body
were eaten up. This filled us with horror, and we knew not
what course to take; but the creatures resolved us soon, for
they gathered about us iresently, in hopes of prey; and I
verily believe there were t tree hundred of them. It happened
very much to our advantage, that at the entrance into the
wood, but a little way from it, there lay some large timber-
trees, which had been cut down the summer before, and I
suppose lay there for carriage. I drew my little troop in
among those trees, and placing ourselves in a line behind one
long tree, I advised them all to alight, and keeping that tree
before us for a breastwork, to stand in a triangle, or three
fronts, inclosing our horses in the centre. We did so, and it
was well we did; for never was a more furious charge than
the creatures made upon us in this place. They came on
with a growlinSS kind of noise, and mounted the piece of tim-
ber which, as said, was our breastwork as if they were only
rushing upon their prey ; and this fury of theirs, it seems, was
principally occasioned by their seeing our horses behind us.
I ordered our men to fire as before, every other man; and they
took their aim so sure, that they killed several of the wolves
at the first volley; but there was a necessity to keep a contin-
ual tiring, for they came on like devils, those behind pushing
on those before.

When we had fired a second volley of our fusees, we thought
they stopped a little, and I hoped' they would have gone off,
but it was but a moment, for others came forward again' so
we fired two volleys of our pistols; and I believe in these out
firings we had killed seventeen or eighteen of them, and lamed
twice as many, yet they came on again. I was loath to spend
our shot too hastily,- so I called m ' servant (not my man
Friday, for he was better em )loye for, with the 'eatest
dexterity imaginable, he had charged at fusee and own
while we \vere engaged); but, as I aai , I called my othe:
man, and iviug him a horn of powder, I bade him lay a tram
all along t e piece of timber, and let it he alarge tram. He
did so; and had but just time to get away, when the wolves
came it ) to it, and some got upon it, when , snapplng an on-
charge pistol close to the powder, set it on fire; those that
were u pen the timber were scorched with it, and six or seven
of them fell, or rather jumped in among us, with the force and
fright of the fire; we despatched these in an Instant, and the
rest were so frightened With the light, which the night (for It
was now very near dark) made more terribleuthat ey drew
back a little; upon which I ordered our last pistols to he fired
off in one volley, and after that we gave a shout: upon tilt!
the wolves turned tail, and we sallied immediately upon near
twenty lame ones, that we Found stru gling on the ground,
and fell a cutting them with our swor. s, which answered our
expectation ; for the cryin and howling they made was bet?-
ite;t understood by their ellows; so that they all fled and
e us.

We hi, first and last, killed about threesoore of them; and
had it been daylight, we had killed many more. . The field d
battle being thus cleared, we made forward again, for we had

u,
still near a league to go. "'e heard the ravenous creatures how.
and yell in the woods as we went, several times, and some-
times we fancied we saw some of them, but the snow dazzling
our eyes, we were not certain: in about an hour more we
came to the town where we were to lodge, which we found in
a terrible fright, and all in arms; tor, it seems, the night be-
fore, the wolves and some bears had broke into the village, and
put them in such terror, that they were obliged to keep guard
night and day, but especially in the night, to preserve their
cattle, and, indeed, their peo :10.

The next morning our guit e was so ill, and his limbs swelled
so nmch with the ranklit r of his two wounds, that he could go
no farther; so we were 0 )liged to take a new guide here, and
go to 'l'houlouse, where we [band a. warm climate, a fruitful,
pleasant country, and no snow, no wolves, nor any thing like
them; but when we told our story at 'l'houlonse, they told us
it was nothing but what was ordinary in the great forest at the
foot of the mountains, es recially when the snmv lay on the
ground ; but they inquiret muclt what kind ol'a guide we had.
got, who would venture to bring,r us that way in such a severe
season; and told us it was surprtsiwr we were not all devoured.
"7 hen we told them how we plaeetr ourselves, and the horses
in the middle, they blamed us exceedingly, and told us it was
fil'ty to one but we had been all destroyed; for it was the sight
of the horses which made the wolves so furious, seeing their
prey; and that, at other times, they are really afraid ot'a gun;

at being excessive hungry, and raving on that account, the
eagerness to come at the horses h: 3 made them senseless of
dancer; and that if we had not, by the continued fire, and at
last Try the stratagcm of the train of wder, mastered them, it
had been great odds but that we tad been torn to pieces;
whereas, had we been content to have sat still on horseback,
and fired as horsemen, they would not have taken the horses
so much for their own, when men were on their Volts, as
otherwise; and withal they told us, that at last, if we had stood
all together, and left our horses, they would have been 3::
eager to have devoured them, that we might have come off
sa e, especially havmg our lire-arms in our hands, and bein
so many in number. For my art,l was never so sensible ot
danger in my lite; for seeing a ve three hundred devils come
roaring and open~mouthed to devour us, and having nothing
to shelter us, or retreat to, I gave myself over for lost; and, as
it was, I believe I shall never care to cross those mountains
again ; I think 1 would much rather go a thousand leagues by
sea, though I was sure to meet with a storm once a week.

I have nothing uncommon to take notice of in my passage
through France,--nothing but what other travellers have given
an account of, with much more advanta e than I can. I
travelled from Tlloulouse to Paris, and wit rout any consider-
able stay came to Calais, and landed safe at Dover, the 14th
ofJanuary, alter havin a severe cold season to travel in.

I'was now come to IE8 centre of my travels, and had in a
little time all my new-discovered estate safe about me; the
bills of exchange whichI brought with me having been very
currently paid.

My principal uide and priv counsellor was In good an-
cient widow; w o, in gratitu e for the money had sent
her, thought no pains too much, nor care too great to employ
for me; and I trusted her so entirely with every thing, that I
was perfectly easy as to the security of my effects; and, in-
deed, I was very happy from the beginning, and now to the
end, in the unspotted integrity of this good gentlewoman.

And now, having resolved to dispose of my plantation in the
Brazils, I wrote to my old friend at Lisbon, who, having
offered it to the two merchants, the survivors of my trustees,
who lived in the Brazils, they accepted the ofl'er, and remitted
thirty-three thousand pieces-of-eight to a correspondent of
theirs at Lisbon, to pay for it.

In return, I signed the instrument of sale in the form which
they sent from Lisbon, and sent it to my old man, who sent
me the bills of exchange for 32,800 pieces-ofeight forfllle es-
tate; reserving the payment of 100 moidares a year to lunl
(the old man) durimr his life, and 50 moidores afterwards to
his son for his life, which I had promised them; and which the
plantation was to make good as a rent-char C.

And thus I have given the first part of a lile of fortune and
adventure--a life ofl'rovidence's checker-work, and of a vari-
ety which the world will seldom be able to show the like of;
beginning foolishly, but closing much more happily than any
part of it ever gave me leave so much as to hope for.

Any one would think, that in this state of complicated ood
fortune, l was past running any more hazards, and so in eed
1 had been, if other circumstances had concurred; but I was
inured to a wandering life, had no family, not many relations;
nor, however rich, had I contracted much acquaintance; and
though I had sold my estate in the Brazils, yet I could not
keep that country out of my head, and had a great mind to be
upon the win 7 . ain; especially I could not resist the strong
inclinationI half to see my island, and to know if the oor
Spaniards were in being there. My true friend, the wi ow,
earnestly dissuaded me from it, and so far prevailed with me,
that, for almost seven years, she prevented mv running abroad;
during which time I took my two nephews, the children of one
of my brothers, into my care : the eldest, having something of
his own, I bred up as a gentleman, and ave him a settlement
of some addition to his estate, after my ecease. The other I

)ut out to a ca tain of a ship; and after five ears finding
lim a sensible, ld, enterprismg young fellow, put him into
a good ship, and sent him to sea; and this young fellow
al'tervfiards drew me in, as old as I was, to farther adventures
mvse .

In the mean time, I in part settled myself here; for, first of
all, I married, and that not either to my disadvantage or dis-
satisfaction, and had three children, two sons and one daugh-
tvr; but my wife dying, and my nephew coming home Wlth
good success from a voyage to Spam, mv inclination to go
abroad, and his importnnity, prevailed, and engaged me to go
in his ship as a private trader to the East Indies: this was In
the year 1694.
In this voyage I visited m ' new colony in the Island, saw
my successors the Spaniards, had the whole story of their
lives, and of the villains I left there; how at first they insulted
the poor Spaniards; how they afterwards agreed, disagreed, uni~
ted, separated; and how at last the Spaniards were obliged to
use violence with them ; how they were subjected to the Span-
iards; how honestly the Spaniards used them; a history, il'it
were entered into, as full of variety and wonderful accidents as
my own part; particularly also as to their battles with the (fa-
ribbeans, who landed several times upon the island, and as to the
improvement they made upon the island itself; and how five
of them made an attempt upon the main land, and brought
away eleven men and tire wmuen prisoners; by which, at my
coming, I found about twenty young children on the island.

Here I staid about twenty days; left them supplies of all
necessary things, and particularly of arms, powder, shot,
clothes, tools, and two workmen, which I brought from England
with me; viz. a carpenter and a smith.

lit-sides this, 1 shared the, lands into parts with them, reserved
to mysell'the property ol'thc whole, but gave them such parts
respectively, as they agreed on: and, havmg settled all things
with them, and engaged them not to leave the place,I lett
them there.

From thence I touched at the Braztls, from whence I sent a
hark, which I bought there, with more people, to the island;
and in it, besides other supplies, I sent seven women, being
such as I lhuud proper tbr service, or for wives to such as
would take them. As to the Englishmen, I promised them to
send them some women from En land, with a ood cargo of
necessaries, if they would apply t emselves to p anting; which
I afterwards could not perform: the fellows proved very honest
and diligent, after they were mastered, and had their pro rties
set apart for them. I sent them also from the Brazis five
cows, three of them being big With calf, some shee , and
some gags, which, when I came again, were consn erably
mores .
But all these things, with an account how three hundred
Caribhces came and invaded them, and ruined their plantations,
and how they fought with that whole number twice, and were
_ at first defeated and one of them killed; but at last a. storm
destroying their enemies' canoes, they famished or destroyed
almost all the rest, and renewed and recovered the possession
of' their plantation, and still lived upon the island ;--all these
things, with some very surprising incidents in some new ad-
ventures of my own, for ten years more, I shall give a further
account of in another volume.
