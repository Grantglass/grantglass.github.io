" MADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE.

 

Jenn, gather round me, little ones, For many things he there had found

And heathen unto me, That he could bring ashore,
And you shall hear a. tale about Upon the raft that he had made,
A lad that went to sea-- And carry 'to his store.

About a. lad that ran away, 'Two kittens and a faithfirl dog,
011, many years go, With powder, guns, and shot,
And lelt his home and parents dee ----- Three cheeses and a. chest of tools,

Young Robinson Crusoel 'Mong other things he got.

Now when this lad grew up a. man, And now he bravely went to work,

It more about one day, Made tables, chains,- aud stoola,
That he was cast upon a. roek-- And shelves around his little home,
An island. far away. On which to lay his tools.

And there to shield him from the storm, lie set a, crous up on the beach,

And keep him sufo and sound, Lest time should go astray,

He built a. house, and thatch'd it o'er, '_.~\nd with his knife he out a. notch,
And fenced it round and round. i To mark each passing day.

For off upon a. sandy bank He caught and tamed a. little kidJ
His ship lay all a wreck; That trotted at his heels;

And oft--times when the sea. was low And with his dog and cats at home,
He got upon the deck. 3 It shared his daily meals.

Yet sometimes he grew very sad, A parrot, that some years before
And then he set him down He artfully had caught,

Upon the shore, and thought his God Would hop upon his thumb, and shriek
Looked on him with a frown. The lessons it was taught

And he would gaze upon the sea, And so, to keep it snug, he made

Across the billows wild; A cage to put it. in:
And wring his hands and cry aloud, And he made a. big umbrella, too,
And weep like any child. And all his clothes of skin.

He thought upon his father's words--[I wot he was the stmugest right
His mother's prayers and teens; That ever you might see;

How theywould grieve for him,theirson, In jacket, brooches, cup, and shoes,
Away so many yearsl A hairy man looked he.

Then he would fhll upon his knees, ,With big umbrella. o'er his head,
I His sword hung at his side,
And ask his God, with many tears, His gun and axe upon his back,

And clasp his hands in prayer,

His wicked life to spare. He rambled far and wide.

 

At times, with gun upon his back, New on the island herds ofgonts
He roamed the island round, Were running wild and free;
But when he tried to catch the things,

Away they all would flee.

 

Where melons, gmpes, and sugar--canes,

 

All growing wild he found.
And, so to get them in his power, elf-length he longed when days were. fine.
He dug pits in the ground; Upon the waves to float;

And there one morn at break of day, ISO with his tools he wont to work,
A goat and kids he found. I And made a. little boat.

The goat he let. away again, He set a must and sail before,
For it was fierce and strong; A rudder, too, behind;

The little kids he tied with strings, And with his dog and gun on board,
And took with him along. 110 sped before the Wind.

And then from running Wild again, One summer morning as he walked
His little flock to keep, Abroad, with gun in hand,

A piece of ground he fenced around, He stood aghast as ho behold

l A footprint in the sand!

And thought. of them by day;

But ere his enemies haul time
A hand on him to lay,

He source would stiglestthoyby('zlu'meo'IIo turned and bounded like a roe,

Should come across his way.

At last one day he climbed a hill,
_ Where oft he used to lie,

And took with him his telescope,
To see what he could spy.

And looking 011' towards the shore,

A sight he did behold,
That set, his; very hair on end,

And made his blood run cold.

A band of painted savages,
He saw to his dismay,

All (laneing round a. fire, on which
A human body lay.

He saw them kill a helpless man,
And one was standing by,

All in an agony of fear,
For he, too, was to die.

Away--away--hway.

Across a. strewn he swam with speed,
Close followed by his foes;
But he was saved by our good friend

The mam in hairy clothes!

A young and comely mun ho was,
So timid and so shy,

W ith tawny skin and hair of jet,
And mild and beaming eye.

And oft. he paused and looked around,
And knelt as if in fear;

:But Crusoe made him signs to come,

And softly he drew near.

'Then Crusoe named him Friday them.
And ever called him so,

9Because upon that very day

 

He saved him (ion) the foe.
And Friday quickly learned to wm'k, Then Crusoe bade him bring the guns,
For ready hand had he; And prime Without delay;

And helped, in time, to build a boat And soon they beat the savages,
And launch it in the sea. And drove them all away.

His master taught him many things, In one canoe upon the sands,
Of God he told him, too, Half dead and strongly bound,
Who made the sun and moon and stars, All ready for to kill and eat,

And watches all we do. A poor old man they found.
A touching sight it was to see, When Friday saw his face, he paused,
Poor Fn'day kneel to pray---- Another look to lake, [wept,
To hear him cry (.0 God for help, Then laughed and criedde subbed and
In his poor broken way. As if his heart would break.

Where'er he was, in house or field, He clasped the old man round the neck,

He ever was the same; And kissed him o'er and o'er;
obeyed his master with a. smile, And leapt and danced with very joy,
And feared his Maker's name. To see that face once more.

One morning Friday came in haste, :Ho gave him food, hebrought; himdrink,
In trembling and in awe, l He out his bonds in twin;

And told hie master three canoes {The dear old father that he loved,
Upon the bench he saw. { Nor thought to see again.
Poor Friday, thoughhie skin was black, Once more on board an English slnp,

His heart was warm and kind---
My little ones, a lesson this,
For all to bear in mind.

Now eight and twenty weary yams,
Had Crusoe been ashore,

Upon his island, night and day,
Nor thought to leave it more.

Then oh, whai: joy was his to see
One mom a spreading sail

Come dancing o'er the waters blue,
Before the swelling gale.

He watched with Friday how a hill,
Though distant. many a mile,
Until he saw a boat put, oii"
And row towards the isle.

And now at last, his trials oier,
With gm-teful heart: he tron. .

And bowed in [hanks to God.

Inis faithful Friday went with him;
His Friday, true and kind,

Who loved him more than all on earth,
He could not leave behind.

,His big umbrella, too, he look,
Hi8 hairy cap as well;

And parrot. with its noisy tongue,
Of other days to tell.

,And then with heavy heart he turned,

'I'o bid his home adieu;
And soon, as onward sped the ship,
It faded from his View.

 

And when old England's shore he saw,
0h, be shed many tea-rs;

i Full five and thirty years.
