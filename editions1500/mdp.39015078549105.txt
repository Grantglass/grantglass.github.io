PREFACE.
AF ever the story of any private man's adven-
tures in the world were worth making pub-
lic, and were acceptable when published, the
Editor of this account thinks this will be so.
The wonders of this man's life exceed all
that (he thinks) is to be found extant j the
life of one man being scarce capable of a
greater variety.
The story is told with modesty, with seri-
ousness, and with a religious application of
events to the uses to which wise men always
apply them, viz. to the instruction of others
by this example, and to justify and honour the
wisdom of Providence in all the variety of our
circumstances, let them happen how they will.
The Editor believes this narrative to be a
just history of fact; neither is there any appear-
ance of fiction in it: and though he is well

aware there are many who, on account of the
very singular preservations the Author met
with, will give it the name of romance; yet,
in which ever of these lights it shall be viewed,
he imagines, that the improvement of it, as
well as the diversion, as to the instruction of
the reader, will be the same; and as such, he
thinks, without farther compliment to the
world, he does them a great service in the.
publication.
THE
Life and Adventures
OF
ROBINSON CRUSOE.
I WAS born at York, in the year 1632, of a reputable fa-
mily. My father was a native of Bremen, who by mer-
chandizing at Hull for some time, gained a very plentiful
fortune. He married my mother at York, who received
her first breath in that county ; and as her maiden name
was Robinfon, I was called Robinson Kreutznacr; which not
being easily pronounced in the English tongue, we are
commonly known by the name of Crusoe.
1 was the youngest of three brothers. The eldest was a
lieutenant-colonel in Lockhart's regiment, but slain by the
Spaniards: what became of the other I could never learn.
No charge or pains were wanting in my education.—
My father designed me for the law; yet nothing would
serve me but I must go to sea, both against the will of my
father, the tears of my mother, and the entreaties of friends.
One morning my fattier expostulated very warmly with me:
What reason, says he, have you to leave your native coun-
try, where there must be a more certain prospect of con-
tent and happiness, to enter into a wandering condition of
uneasiness and uncertainty? He recommended to me
Augur's wish, "Neither to desire poverty nor riches:"
that a middle state of life was the most happy, and that
the high towering thoughts of raising our condition by wan-
dering abroad, were surrounded with misery and danger,
and often ended with confusion and disappointment. I entreat you, nay, I command you, (says he) to desist from
these intentions. Consider your elder brother, who laid
down his life for his honour, or rather lost it for his disobe-
dience to my will. If you will go (added he) my prayers
shall however be offered for your preservation; but a time
may come, when desolate, opprefsed, or forsaken, you A

may wish you had taken your poor despised father's counsel.
He pronounced these words with such a moving and pater-
nal eloquence, while floodsof tears ran down his aged cheeks,
that it seemed to stem the torrent of my. resolutions. But
this soon wore off, and a little after I informed my mother,
that I could not settle to any business, my resolutions were
so strong to see the world; and begged she would gain my
father's consent only to go one voyage; which if it did not
prove prosperous, I would never attempt a second. But my
desire was as vain as my folly in asking. My mother paf-
sionatcly exprelied 1ier dislike of this proposal, telling me, "That as she saw I was bent upon my own destruction, con-
"trary to their will and my duty, she would say no more,
"but leave me to myself to do whatever I pleased."
I was then, I think, nineteen yearsold, when one timebe- .ing at Hull, I met a school-fellow of mine going along with
his father, who was master of a ship, to London; and ac-
quainting him with my wandering desires, he assured me of
a free passage, and a plentiful share of what w.as necefsary.
Thus, without imploring ablefsing, or taking farewell of my
parents, I took shipping on thefirst of September, 1631. We
set sail soon after, and our ship had scarce left the Humbcr
a-stern, when there arose so violent a storm, that b«ing exrtremely sea-sick, I concluded the judgment of God deserv-
edly followed me for my disobedience to my dear parents. It was then I called to mind the good advice of my father;
how easy and comfortable was a middle state of life; and
I firmly resolved, if it pleased God to set me on dry land
once more, I would return to my parents, implore their for*
givenefs, and bid a final adieu to my wandering inclinations.
Such were my thoughts while the storm continued; but
these good resolutions decreased with the danger; more
especially when my companion came to me clapping me on
the shoulder: "What, Bob \" said he, "sure you was not
frightened last night with scarce a capful of wind ?"—
"And do you," cried I, " call such a violent storm a capful
"of wind?" "A storm you fool you," said he, "this is no-
"thing; a good ship and sea-room always baffles such a
"foolish squall of wind as that: But you're a fresh water
"sailor: Come boy, turn out, see what tine weather we have
now, and a good bowl of punch will drown all your past
"sorrows." In short, the punch was made, I was drunk, and
in one night's time drowned both my repentance and

resolutions, forgetting entirely the vows and promises
I made in my distress: and whenever any reflections would
return on me, what by company, and what by drinking, I
soon mastered those fits, as I deridingly called them. But
this only made way for another trial, whereby I could not
but see how much I was beholden to kind Providence.
Upon the sixth day we came to an anchor in Harwich
road, where we lay wind-bound with some Newcastle ships;
and there being good anchorage, and our cables sound, the
seamen forgot their late toil and danger, and spent the time as merry as ifthey had been on shore. But on the eighth day
there arose a brisk gale of wind, which prevented our tiding
it up the river; and still increasing, our ship rode forecastle
in, and shipped several large seas.
It was not long before horror seized the seamen them-
selves, and I heard the master express this melancholy ejacu-
lation, '* Lord have mercy upon us, we shall be all lost and
undone!" For my part, sick unto death, I kept my cabin,
till the universal and terribly dreadful apprehensions of our speedy fate made me get upon deck; and there I was af-
frighted indeed. The sea went mountains high: I could
see nothing but distrefs around us; two ships had cut their
masts on board, and another was foundered; two more that
had lost their anchors, were forced out to the mercy of the
ocean: and to save our lives we were forced to cut out
foremast and mainmast quite away.
Who is there so ignorant as not to judge of my dreadful
condition? I was but a fresh water sailor, and therefore it
seemed more terrible. Our ship was very good, but over-
loaded 5 which made the sailors often cry out, "She would
"founder!" Words I then was ignorant of. All this while
the storm continuing, and rather increasing, the master and
the most sober part of his men went to prayers, expecting
death every moment. In the middle of the night one cried
out, "We had sprung a leak;" another, " That there was
"four feet water in the hold." I was just ready to expire
with fear, when immediately all hands were called to the
pump; and the men forced me also in that extremity to
share with them in their labour. While thus employed, the
master espying some light colliers, fired a gun as a signal of
distress; and I, not understanding what it meant, and think-
ing that either the ship broke, or some dreadful thing hap-
pened, fell into a swoon. Even in that common condition A 2
of woe, nobody minded me, excepting to thrust me aside
with their feet, thinking me dead, and it was a great while
before I recovered.
Happy it was for us, when upon the signal given, they
ventured out their boats to save our lives. All our pumping
had been in vain, and vain had all our at tempts beeu, had they
not come to our ship's side, and our men cast them a rope over
the stern with a buoy to it, which after great labour they got
hold o!, and we hauling them up to us, got into their boat,
and left our ship, which we perceived sink within less than a
quarter of an hour; and thus I learned what was meant by
four,aering at sea,. And now the men incessantly laboured to
recover their own ship; but the sea ran so high, and the wind
blew so hard, that they thought it convenient to hale within
shore; which, with great difficulty and danger, at last we
happily effected, landing at a place called Cramer, not far from
Winterton light-house; from whence we all walked to Yar-
mouth, where as objects of pity, many good people furnished
us \viih necef'aries to carry us either to Hull or London.
Strange, after all this, like the prodigal son, I did not re-
turn to my father; who hearing of the ship's calamity, for a
long time thought me entombed in the deep. No doubt
but I should have shared on his fatted calf, as the scripture
exprelstth it; but my ill /ate stiil pushed me on, in spite of
the powerful convictions of reason and conscience.
When we had been at Yarmouth three days, I met my
old companion, who had given me the invitation to go on
board along with his father. His behaviour and speech
were altered, and in a melancholy manner asked me howl
did. telling his father who I was, and how I had made this
voyage only for a trial to proceed further abroad. Upon
which the old gentleman turning to me gravely, said,
"Young man, you ought never to go to sea any more, but to
take this for a certain sign that you never will prosper in
a seafaring condition." "Sir," answered I, "will you
take the same resolution?" " U is a different case," said
he, "it is my calling, and consequently my duty; but as
you have made this voyage for a trial, you see what ill
"succels Heaven has set before your eyes; and perhaps
our miseries have been on your account, likejena/i in the
ship of Taishisli. But pray, what are you, and on what
"account did you go to sea?" Upon which 1 verv freely
declared my whole story: at the end of which he made this *'
exclamation: "Ye sacred powers: what had I committed,
"that such a wretch should enter into my ship to heap upon
me such a deluge of miseries!" But soon recollecting
his passion, "Young man," said he, " ifyou do not go back,
"depend upon it, wherever you go, you will meet with
disasters and disappointments till your father's words arfc
"fulfilled upon you." And so we parted.
I thought at first toreturn home; but shame opposed that
good motion, as thinking I should be laughed at by my neighbours and acquaintance. So strange is the nature of youth,
who are not ashamed to sin, but yet ashamed to repent; and
so far from being ashamed of those actions, for which they
may be accounted fools, they think it folly to return to their
duty, which is the principal mark of wisdom. In short, I
travelled up to London, resolving upon a voyage; and a
voyage I soon heard of, by my acquaintance with a captain
who took a fancy to me, togo to thecoast of Guinea. Hav-
ing some money, and appearing like a gentleman, I went
on board, not as a common sailor or foremast man; nay,
the commander agreed I should go that voyage with him
without any expense; that I should be his messmate and
companion, and I was very welcome to carry any thing
with me, and make the best merchandise I could.
1 blefsed my happy fortune, and humbly thanked my cap-
tain for this offer; and acquainting my friends in Yorkshire,
forty pounds were sent me, the greatest part of which my
dear father and mother contributed to, with which I bought
toys and trifles, as the captain directed me. My captain
also taught me navigation, how to keep an account of the
ship'scourse, take an observation, and led me into the know-
ledge of several useful branches of the mathematics. And
indeed this voyage made me both a sailor and a merchant;
for I brought home five pounds nine ounces of gold-dust for
my adventure, which produced, at my return to London,
almost three hundred pounds. But in this voyage I was ex-
tremely sick, being thrown into a violent calenture through
the excessive heat, trading upon the coast from the latitude
of fifteen degrees north, even to the line itself.
But alas! my dear friend, the captain, soon departed this
life after his arrival. This was a sensible grief to me: yet
1 resolved to go another voyage with his mate, who had
now got command of the ship. This proved a very unsuc-
cdsful one; for though I did not carry quite a hundred
A a
pounds of my late acquired wealth, (so that I had two hun-
dred pounds left, which I reposed with the Captain's widow,
who was an honest gentlewoman) yet my misfortunes in
this unhappy voyage were very great. For our ship sailing
towards the Canary islands, we were chased by a Salee
rover; and in spiteof all the haste we could make, by crowd-
ing as much canvass as our yards could spread, or our masts
carry, the pirate gained upon us, so that we prepared our-
selves to fight. They had eighteen guns, and we had but
twelve. About three in the afternoon there was a desperate
engagement, wherein many were killed and wounded on
both sides; but finding ourselves overpowered with num-
bers, our ship disabled, and ourselves too impotent to have
the least hopes of success, we were forced to surrender; and
accordingly were all carried prisoners into the port of Salee.
Our men were sent to the Emperor's court to be sold there;
but the pirate captain taking notice of me, kept me to be
his own slave.
In this condition, I thought myself the most miserable
creature on earth, and theprophecy of myfathercameairesh
into my thoughts. However, my condition was better than
I thought it to be, as will soon appear. Some hopes indeed
I had that my new patron would go to sea again, where he
might be taken by a Spanish or Portuguese man of war, and
then I should be set at liberty. But in this I was mistaken;
for he never took me with him, but left me to look after his
little garden, and do the drudgery of his house, and when he
returned from sea, would make me lie in the cabin, and
look after the ship. I had no one that I could communicate
my thoughts to, which were continually meditating my
escape; r,o Englishman, Irishman, or Scotchman here, but
myself; and for two years I could see nothing practicable,
but only pleased myself with the imagination.
After some length of time, my patron, as I found, grew so
poor that he could not fit out his ship as usual; and then he
used constantly, once or twice a week, if the weather was
fair,-togo out a fishing, taking me and ayoungMorescoboy
to row the boat; aud so much pleased was he with me for
my dexterity in catching the fish, that he would often send
me with a Moor, who was one of his kinsmen, and the Mo-
resco youth. to catch a dish offish for him.
One morning, as we were at the sport, there arose such
a thick fog, that we lost sight of the shore; and rowing we knew not which way, we laboured all the night, and in the
morning found ourselves in the ocean, two leagues from
land. However, we attained there at length, and made the
greater haste, because ourstomachs were exceedingly sharp
and hungry. In order to prevent such disasters for the
future, my patron ordered a carpenter to build a little state
room or cabin in the middle of the long-boat, with a place
behind it to steer and hale home the main sheet, with other
conveniences to keep in from the weather, as also lockers to
put in all manner of provisions, with a handsome shoulder
of mutton sail, gibing over the cabin.
In this he frequently took us out a fishing; and one time
inviting two or three persons of distinction togo with him,
made provision extraordinary, providing also three fusees,
with powder and shot, that they might have some sport at
fowling along the sea-coast. The next morning the boat
was made clean, her ancient and pendants out, and every
thing ready; but their minds altering, my patron ordered
us to go a fishing, for that his guests would certainly sup
with him that night.
And now I began to think of my deliverance indeed. In
order to this I persuaded the Moor to get some provisions on board, as not daring to meddle with our patron's; and
he taking my advice, we stored ourselves with rusk biscuit,
and three jars of water. Besides, I privately conveyed
into the boat a bottle of brandy, some twine, thread, a ham-
mer, hatchet, and a saw; and, in particular, some bees' wax,
which was a great comfort to me, and served to make can-
dles. I then persuaded Muley (for so was the Moor called)
to procure some powder and shot, pretending to kill seacur-
leus, which he innocently and readily agreed to. In short,
beingprovided with all things necessary, we sailed out, re-
solving for my own part tomake my escape, though itshould
cost me my life.
When we had pafsed the castle, we fell a fishing; but
though I knew there was a bite, I dissembled the matter, in
order to put out further to sea. Accordingly we ran a league
further; when giving the boy the helm, and pretending to
stoop for something, I seized Muley by surprise and threw
him overboard. As he was an excellent swimmer, he soon
arose, and made towards the boat; upon which, I took out
H fusee, and presented at him: "Muley," said 1} " I never
yet designed to do you any harm, and seek nothing now u but my redemption. I know you are able enough to swim
to shore, and save your life; but if you are resolved to
follow me, to the endangering of mine, the very moment
you proceed, I will shoot you through the head." The
harmless creature at these words, turned himself from me,
and I make no doubt got safe to land. Then turning to the
boy Xury, I perceived he trembled at the action; but I put
him out of all fear, telling him, that if he would be true and
faithful to me, I would do well by him. "And therefore,"
said I, "you must stroke yourface to be faithful; and, as the
"Tu iks have learned you, swear by Mahomet, and the beard
of your father, or else I will throw you into the sea also."
So innocent did the child then look, and with such an oblig-
ing smile consented, that I readily believed him, and from
that day forward began to love him entirely.
We then pursued our voyage; and least they should think
me gone to the Straits' mouth, I kept to the southward to
the truly Barbarian coast; but in the duskof the evening, I
changed my course, and steering directly S. and byE. that I
might keep near the shore; and having a fresh gale of wind,
with a pleasant smooth sea, by three o'clock next day I was
onehundredand fifty miles beyond the Emperorof Morocco's
dominions. Yet still having the dreadful apprehension of
being retaken, I continued sailing for five days successively, till such time as the wind shifting to the south ward, made me
conclude, that if any vessel was in chase of me, they would
proceed no farther. After so much fatigue and thought, I
anchored at the mouth of a little river, I knew not what or
where: neitherdidlthenseeany people. What (principally
wanted was fresh water; and I was resolved about dusk to
swim ashore. But no sooner did the gloomy clouds of night
begin to succeed the declining day, when we heard such
barking, roaring, and howling of wild creatures, that one might have thought the very strongest monsters of nature, or
infernal spirits had their residence there. Poor Xury, almost
dead with fear, entreated me not to go on shore that night.
"Supposing I don't, Xury," said I, " and in the morning we
should see men who are worse than those we fear, what
"then?" "O den we may givedemde shoot gun,"repliedXury,
laughing," and de gun makedem all run away."The wit and
brokenEr.^lish which the boy had learned among the captives
of our nation, pleased me entirely; and to add to his cheer-
fulnfcfs, I gave him a dram of the bottle: we could get but little sleep all the night for those terrible bowlings they made;
and, indeed, we were both very much affrighted, when, by
the rollings of the water, and other tokens, we justly con-
cluded one of those monsters made towards our boat. I could
not see, till it came within two oars' length, when taking my
fusee, I let fly at him. Whether I hit him or no, I cannot
tell; but he made towards the shore, and the noise of my
gun increased the stupendous noise of the monsters.
The next morning I was resolved to go on shore to get
fresh water, and venture my life among the beastser savages,
should either attack me. Xury said, he would take one of
the jars and bring me some. I asked him, why he would
go, and not I? The poor boy answered, "If wild manscome,
they eat me, you go away." A mind scarcely now to be
imitated, so contrary to self-preservation, the most powsrful
law of Nature. This indeed increased my affection to the
child. "Well, dearXury," said I, "we will both go ashore,
both kill wild mans, and they shall eat neither of us." So
giving Xury a piece of rusk-bread to eat, and a dram, we
waded ashore, carrying nothing with us but our arms, and
two jars for water. I did not go out of sight of the boat, as
dreading the savages coming down the river in their canoes;
but the boy seeing a low descent or vale about a mile in the
country, he wandered to it: and then running back to me
with great precipitation, I thought he was pursued by some
savage or wild beast; upon which I approached, resolving
to perish or protect him from danger. As he came nearer
to me, I saw something hanging over his shoulders, which
was a creature he had shot like a hare, but different in colour,
and longer legs; however we were glad of it, for it proved
wholesome and nourishing meat: but what added to our joy
was, my boy assured me there was plenty of water, and that
he xenonutidmans. And greater still was our comfort, when
the tide was out, without going so far up into the country.
In this place I began to consider that the Canary and Cape
de Verde islands lay not far off; but having no instrument, I knew not what latitude, or when to stand off to sea for
them; yet my hopes were I should meet some of the Eng-
lish trading vessels, who would relieve and take us in.
The place I was in was no doubt that wild country, in-
habited only by a few, that lies between the Emperor of
Morocco's dominions and the Negroes. It is filled with
wild beasts, and the Moors use it for hunting caierly. From It j IFF AND Anvr-; j r;<rs
'this place I thought I saw the top of the mountain Teneriff
in the Canaries; which made me try twice to attain it;
-but as often was I drove back, and so forced to pursue my
fortune along shore.
Early one morning we came to an anchor under a little
point of land, but pretty high; and the tide beginning to
*ow, we lay ready to go further in. But Xury, whose
youthful and penetrating eyes were sharper than mine, in a
softione, desired me to keep far from land, lest we should
be devoured. "For look yonder, mayter," said he, " and see
de dreadful monster fast asleep on de side of de hill."—.
Accordingly looking where he pointed, I espied a fearful
monster indeed. It was a terrible great lion that lay on
shore, covered as it were by a shade of a piece of the hill.
"Xury," said I, " you shall go on shore and kill him." But
the'boy looked amazed: "Me kill him !" says he, ''he eat
me at one mouth;" meaning one mouthful. Upon which I
bid him lie still, and charging my biggest gun with two slugs, and a good charge of powder, I took the best aim I
could to shoot him through the head, but his leg lying over
his nose, the slug broke his knee-bone. The lion awaking
with the pain, got up, but soon fell down, giving the most
hideous groan I ever heard: but taking my second piece,
I shot him through the head, and then he lay struggling for
life. Upon this Xury took heart, and desired my leave to
go on shore. "Go then," said I. Upon which taking a
little gun in one hand, he swam to shore with the other, and coming close to the lion, put a period to his life by shooting
him again through the head.
But this was spending our ammunition in vain, the flesh
not being good to eat. Xury was like a champion, and
comes on board for a hatchet, to cut off the head of his ene-
my; but not having strength to perform it, he cut off and
brought me a foot. I bethought me, however, that his skin
would be of use. This work cost Xury and me a whole
day; when spreading it on the top of our cabin the hot
beams of the sun effectually dried it in two days time, and
it afterwards served me for a bed to lie on.
And now we sailed southerly, living sparingly on our pro-
visions, and wentnooftener on shore than we were obliged
for fresh water. My design was to make the river Gambia
or Senegal, or any where about the Cape de Verde, in hopes
to meet some European ship. If Providence did not so fit-
vour me, my next course was to seek for the islands, or lose my life among the Negroes. And,. in a word, I put my
whole stress upon this, "Either that "I must meet with
some ship or certainly perish."
One day as we were sailing along, we saw people stand.
on the shore looking at us; we could also perceive they
were black and stark naked. I was inclined to go on »liore»
butXury cried, "No, no;" however, I approached nearer,
and I found they run along the shore by me a good way.
They had no weapons in their hands, except one, who held
a long stick, which Xury told me was a lance, with which
they could kill at a great distance. I talked to them by signs
and made them sensible I wanted something to eat; they beckoned me to stop my boat, while two of them ran up into the country, and in less than half an hour came back,
and brought with them two pieces of dried flesh, and some
corn, which we kindly accepted; and to prevent any fears
on either side, they brought the food to the shore, laid it
down, then went and stood a great way off till we fetched
it on board, and then came close to us again.
But while we were returning thanks to them, being all we
could afford, two mighty creatures camefrom the mountains;
one as it were pursuing the other with great fury, which we
were the rather inclined to believe, as they seldom appear
but in the night; and both these swiftly pafsing by the ne-
groes, jumped into the sea, wantonly swimming about, as
tho' the'divcrsionof the waters had put a stop to their fierce-
ftefs. At last one of diem coming nearer to my boat than I
expected or desired, I shot him directly thro' the head; upon
which he sunk immediately, yet rising again, would have
willingly made the shore; but between the wound and the
strangling of the water, he died before he could reach it.
It.isimpoisible to express the consternation the poor Ne-
groes were in at the firing of my gun; much less can I men-
tion their surprise, when they perceived the creature to be
slain by it. I made signs to them to draw near it with a
rope, and then gave it them to hale on shore. It was a beau-
tiful leopard, which made me desire its skin: and the Ne-
groes seeming to covet the.carcase, I freely gave it to them.
As for the other leopard, it made to shore, and ran with pro-
digious swiftness out of sight. The Negroes having kindly
furmshed me with water, and with what roots and grains
their country afforded, I took my leave, and, after eleven*
days sail, came in sight of the Cape de Verde, and those islands called by its name. But thegreatdistancel was from
it, and fearing contrary winds would prevent my reaching
them, I began to grow melancholy and dejected, when, upon
a sudden, Xury cried out, " Master! Master! a ship with a
sail!" and looked as affrighted as if it was his master's ship
sent in search of us. But 1 soon discovered she was a Por-
tuguese ship, as I thought bound to the coast of Guinea for
Negroes. Upon which I strove for life to come up to them.
But vain had it been, if through their perspective glasses they
had not perceived me, and shortened their sail to letmecome
up. Encouraged at this, I set up my patron's ancient, and
fired a gun, both as signals of distress; upon which they
very kindly lay to, so that in three hours time I came up
with them. They spoke to me in Portuguese, Spanish, and
French, but neither of these did I understand; till at length
a Scots sailor called, and then I told him I was an English-
man, who had escaped from the Moors at Salee; upon
which they took me kindly on board, with all my effects.
Surely none can express the inconceivable joy I felt at
this happy deliverance! who from being a late miserable
and forlorn creature, was not only relieved, but in favour
with the master of the ship, to whom, in return for my de-
liverance, I offered all I had. "God forbid," said he,
"that I should take any thing from you. Every thing shall
be delivered to you when you come to Brazil. Ifl have
saved your life, it is no more than I should expect to re-
"ceive myself from any other, when in the same circum-
"stances I should happen to meet the like deliverance.—
"And should I take from you what you have, and leave you
at Brazil, why, this would be only taking away a life I
had given. My charity teaches me better. Those effects
"you have will support you there, and provide you a pat
"sage home again." And, indeed, he acted with the strict-
est justice in what he did, taking my thingsjnto his possession, and giving me an exact inventory, even to my earthen
jars. He bought my boat of me for the ship's use, giving
me a note of eighty pieces of eight, payable at Brazil; and
if any body offered more he would make it up. He also
gave me sixty pieces for my boy Xury. It was with great
reluctance 1 was prevailed upon to sell the child's liberty,
who hud seived me so faithfully; but the boy was willing
himself; and it was agreed, that after ten years he should
4
be made free, upon his renouncing Mahometanism, and
embracing Christianity.
Having a pleasant voyage to the Brazils, we arrived in
the Bay de Todos los Santos, or All Saints' Bay, in twenty
two days after. And here I cannot forget the generous
treatment of the captain. He would take nothing for my
pafsage, gave me twenty ducats for the leopard's skin, and
thirty for the lion's. Every thing he caused to be delivered,
and what I would sell he bought. In short I made about
220 pieces of my cargo; and with this stock I entered
once more, as I may say, into the scene of life.
Being recommended to an honest planter, I lived with
him till such time as I was informed of the manner of their
planting and making sugar; and seeing how well they
lived, and how suddenly they grew rich, I was filled with a
desire to settle among them, and resolved to get my money
remitted to me, and to purchase a plantation.
To be brief, I bought a settlement next door to an honest
and kind neighbour, born at Lisbon, of English parents, whose plantation joining to mine, we improved it very ami-
cably together. Both our stocks were low, and for two
years we planted only for food: but the third year we
planted some tobacco, and each of us drelsed a large piece
of ground the ensuing year for planting canes. But now
I found how much I wanted assistance, and repented the
loss of my dear boy Xary.
Having none to assist me, my father's words came into
my mind; and I used to ask myself, if what I sought was
only a middle station ol'life, why could it not as well be ob-
tained in England as here? When I pondered on this with
regret, the thoughts of my late deliverance forsook me. I
had none to converse with but my neighbour; no work to be
done but by my own hands; it often made me say, my con-
dition was like to that of a man cast upon a desolate island.
So unhappy are we in our reflections, so forgetful of what
good things we receive ourselves, and so unthankful for
our deliverance from those calamities that others endure.
I was in some measure settled, before the captain who
took me up departed from the Brazils. One day I went to
him, and told him what stock I had in London, desiring his
assistance in getting it remitted; to which the good gentle-
man readily consented, but would only have me send for half my money, lest it should miscarry; which, if it did, L
fi
might still have the remainder to support me: and so taking
letters of procuration of me, bid me trouble myself no far-
ther about it.
And indeed wonderful was his kindness towards me; for
he not only procured the money I had drawn for upon my
captain's widow, but sent me over a servant with a cargo
proportionable to my condition. He also sent me over
tools of all sorts, iron-work, and utensils necessary for my
plantation, which proved to be of the greatest use to me
in my business.
Wealth now accumulating on me, and uncommon success crowning my prosperous labours, I might have rested happy
in that middle state of life my father had so often recom-
mended: yet nothing would content me, such was my evil
genius, but I must leave this happy station, for a foolish am-
bition in rising; and thus, once more, I cast myself into the
greatest gulph of misery that ever poor creature fell into.
Having lived four years in Brazil, I had not only learned
the language, but contracted acquaintance with the most
eminent planters, and even the merchants of St. Salvador;
to whom, once, by way of discourse, having given account
of my two voyages to the coast of Guinea, and the manner
of trading there for mere trifles, by which we furnish our
plantations with negroes, they gave such attention to what I
said that three of them came one morning to me, and told
me they had a secret proposal to make. After enjoining me
to secresy (it being an infringementon the powers of the
kings of Portugal and Spain) they told me they had a mind
to fit out a ship to go to Guinea, in order to stock the plan-
tation with Negroes, which as they could not be publicly
.sold, they would divide among them; and if I would go
their supercargo in the ship to manage the trading part, I
should have an equal share of the Negroes, without provid-
ing any stock. The thing indeed was fair enough had I
been in another condition. But I was born to be my own
destroyer, could not resist the proposal, but accepted the of-
fer upon condition of their looking after my plantation. So
making a formal will, I bequeathed my effects to my good
friend the captain, as my universal heir; but obliged him to dispose of my effects as directed, one half of the produce
to himself, and the other to be shipped to England.
The ship being fitted out, and all things ready, we set
sail the first oi September, 1659, being the same dayeigh:
years I left my father and mother in Yorkshire. We sailed
northward upon the coast, in order to gain Africa, till we
made Cape Augustine; from whence going farther into the
ocean, out of sight of land, we steered as though we were
bound for the isle Fernand de Norenba, leaving the islands
on the east; and then it was that we met with a terrible
tempest, which continued for twelve days succefsively, so
that the winds carried us wheresoever they pleased. In this
perplexity one of our men died, and one man and a boy
were washed overboard. When the weather cleared up a
little, we found ourselves eleven degrees north latitude, upon
the coast of Guinea. Upon this the captain gave reasons
for returning; which I opposed, counselling him to stand
away for Barbadoes, which, as I supposed, mtght beattained
in fifteen days. So altering our course, we sailed north-
west and by west, in order to reach the Leeward islands ; -
but a second storm succeeding, drove us to the westward;
so that we were justly afraid of falling into the hands of
cruel savages, or the paws of devouring beasts of prey.
In this great distress, one of our men, early in the morn-
ing cried out, " Land, land!" which he had ho sooner cried
out, but our ship struck upon a sand-bank, and in a moment
the sea broke over her in such a manner, that we expected
we should all have perished immediately. We knew no-
thing where we were, or upon what land we were driven;
whetheran island or the main, inhabited or not inhabited;
and we could not so much as hope that the ship would hold out
many minutes, without breaking in pieces, except the wind
by a miracle, should turn about immediately. While we
stood looking at one another, expect ing death every moment,
the mate lays hold of the boat, and with the help of the rest
got her flung over the ship's side, and getting all into her,
being eleven of us, committed ourselves to God's mercy and
the wild sea. And now we saw that this last effort would
not be sufficient protection from death; so high did the sea
rise, that it was impofsible the boat should live. As to
making sail, we had none; neither if we had could we
make use of any. So that when we had rowed, or rather
were driven about a league and a half, a raging wave, like
a lofty mountain, came rolling a-stern of us, and took us
with such fury, that at once it overset the boat. Thus being
swallowed up in a moment, we had hardly time to call upon
the tremendous nameof God; much less to implore, in dying
ejaculations, hisinfinite mercy to receive our departing souU.
Men are generally counted insensible when struggling in
the pangs of death; but while I was overwhelmed with
water, I had the most dreadful apprehensions imaginable.
For the joys of heaven and the torments of hell, seemed to
present themselves before me in these dying agonies, and
even small space of time, as it were, between life and death.
I was going I thought I knew not whither, into a dismal
gulph unknown, and as yet unperceived, never to behold
my friends, nor the light of this world any more! Could I
even have thought of annihilation, ora total dissolution of
soul as well as body, the gloomy thoughts of having no far-
ther bemg, no knowledge of what we hoped for, but an
cternai quietus, without life or sense: even that, I say,
\vou!d lnwe been enough to strike me with horror and con-
fusion! I strove, however, to the last extremity, while all
my companions were overpowered and entombed in the
tieep: and it was with great difficulty I kept my breath till
the wave spent itself, and retiring back, left me on the shore
half dead with the water I had taken in. As soon as I got
on my feet, I ran as fast as I could, least another wave
should pursue me, and carry me back again. But for all
the haste 1 made, I could not avoid it: for the sea came
after me like a high mountain, or furious enemy; so that
my business was to hold my breath, and by raising myself
on the water, preserve it by swimming. The next dread-
ful wave buried me at once twenty or thirty feet deep but at
the same time carried me with a mighty force and swiftness toward the shore; when raising myself, I held out as well
as possible, till at length the water having spent itself, be-
gan to return, at which I struck forward and feeling ground
with my feet, I took to my heels again. Thus being served
twice more, I was at length dashed against a piece of rock,
in such a manm.r as left me senseless; but recovering a
little before the return of the wave, which, no doubt, would
then have overwhelmed me, I held fast by the rock till those
succeeding waves abated; and then fetching another run,
was overtaken by a small wave, which was soon conquered.
But before any more could overtake me, I reached the main
land, where clamberingup the cliffs of the shore, tired and
jilmost spent I sat down on the grass, free from the dangers
of the foaming ocean.
No tongue can express the ecstasies and transports that
my sou! felt at the happy deliverance. It was like a reprieve to a dying malefactor, with a halter about his neck, and
ready to be turned off. I was wrapt up in contemplation,
and often lifted up my hands, with the profoundest humility,
to the Divine Powers, for saving my life, when the rest of
my companions were all drowned. And now I began to
cast my eyes around, to behold what place I was in, and
what I had next to do. I could see no house nor people; I
was wet, yet had no clothes to shift me; hungry and thirsty,
yet had nothing to cat or drink; no weapon to destroy any
creature for my sustenance, nor defend myself against de-
vouring beasts; in short, I had nothing but a knife, a
tobacco-pipe, and a box half filled with tobacco. The
darksome night coming on upon me, increased my fears of
being devoured by wild creatures; my mind was plunged
in despair, and having no prospect, as I thought, of life be-
fore me, I prepared for another kind of death than what I
had lately escaped. I walked about a furlong to see if I
could find any fresh water, which I did to my great joy:
and taking a quid of tobacco to prevent hunger, I got up
into a thick bushy tree, and seating myself so that I could
not fall, a deep sleep overtook me, and for that night buried
my sorrows in a quiet repose.
It was broad day the next morning before I awaked;
when I not only perceived the tempest was ceased, but saw
the ship driven almost as far as the rock before-mentioned,
which the waves had dashed me against, and which was about a mile from the place where I was. When I came
down from my apartment in the tree, I perceived the ship's
Loat two miles distant on my right-hand, lying on shore, as
the waves had cast her. I thought to have got to her; but
there being an inlet of water of about half a mile's breadth
between it and me, I returned again towards the ship, as
hoping to find something for my more immediate subsistence.
About noon, when the sea was calm, that I. could come
within a quarter of a mile of her, it was to my grief that I perceived, that if we had kept on board all our lives had
been saved. These thoughts, and my solitude, drew tears
from my eyes, though all in vain. So resolving to get to
the ship, I stripped and leapt into the water, when swim-
ming round her, I was afraid I should not get any thing to
lay hold of; but it was my good fortune to espy a small piece of rope hang down by the fore-chains, so low that, by
the help of it, though with great difficulty, I got into u*«.
forecastle of the ship. Here I found that the ship was
bulged, and had a great deal of water in her hold; her stern
was lifted up against a bank, and her head almost to the
water. All her quarter, and what was there, was free and
dry. The provisions I found in good order, with which I
crammed my pockets, and losing no time, ate while I was
doing other things; I also found some mm, of which I took
a hearty dram; and now I wanted for nothing except a
boat, which indeed was all, to carry away what was need-
ful for me.
Necessity occasions quickness of thought. We had se-
veral spare yards, a spare topmast or two, and two or three
large spars of wood. With these I fell to work, and slung
as many of them overboard as I could manage, tying every
one of them with a rope, that they might not drive away.
This done, I went'down to the ship's side, and tied four of
them fast together at both ends, in form of a raft, and laying
two or three short pieces of plank upon them crosswise, I
found it would bear me, but not any considerable weight.
Upon which I went to work again, cutting a spare topmast
into three lengths, adding them to my raft with a great deal
of labour and pains. I then considered what I should load
it with, it being not able to bear a ponderous burden. And
this I SQon thought of, first laying upon it all the planks and
boards I.could get; next I lowered down three of the sea-
men's chests, after 1 had filled them with bread, rice, three
Dutch cheeses, five pieces of dried goat's flesh, and some
European corn, what little the rats had spared; and for
liquors, I found several cases of bottles belonging to our
skipper, in which were some cordial waters, and four or
rive gallons of rack, which I stowed by themselves. By
this time the tide beginning to flow, I perceived my coat,
waistcoat, and shirt, swim away, which I had left on the
shore; as for my linen-breeches and stockings, I swam with
them to the ship; but I soon found clothes enough, though I
took no more than I wanted for the present. My eyes were
chiefly on tools to work with; and, after a long search, I
found out the carpenter's chest, which I got safe down on my
raft. I then looked for arms and ammunition, and in the
great cabin found two good fowling-pieces, two pistols, se-
veral powder-horns filled, a small bag of shot, and two old
rusty swords. I likewise found three barrels of powder,
two of which were good, but the third had taken water, also two or three broken oars, two saws, an ax, and a ham-
mer. I then put to sea, and in getting to shore had three
encouragements. I. A smooth calm sea. 2. The tide
rising and setting in to shore. 3. The little wind there was
blew towards the land. After I had sailed about a mile, I
found the raft to drive a little distance from the place where
I first landed; and then I perceived a little opening of the
land, with a strong current of the tide running into it: up-
on which I kept the middle of the stream. But great was
my concern, when on a sudden the forepart of my raft ran
aground, so that had I not, with great difficulty, for near
half an hour, kept my back straining against the chests to
keep my effects in their places, all I had would have gone
into the sea. But after some time, the rising of the water
caused the raft to float again, and coming up a little river
with land on both sides, I landed in a little cave, as near the
mouth as possible, the better to discover a sail, if any such
providentially pafsed that way.
Not far off, I espied a hill of stupendous height, sur-
rounded with lefser hills about it, and thither I was resolved
to go and view the country, that I might see what part
was best to fix my habitation. Accordingly, arming my-
self with a pistol, a fowling-piece, powder and ball, I as-
cended the mountain. There I perceived I was in an
island, encompassed by the sea; no distant lands to be seen
but scattering rocks that lay to the west: that it seemed to
be a barren place, and as I thought, inhabited only by wild
beasts. I perceived abundance of fowls, but ignorant of
what kind, or whether good for nourishment; I shot one of
them at my return, which occasioned a confused screaming
among the other birds, and I found it by its colour and beak
to be a kind of hawk, but its flesh was perfect carrion.
When I came to my raft, 1 brought. my effects on shore,
which work spent that day entirely; and fearing that some
cruel beasts might devour me in the night time while I slept, I
made a kind of hut or barricade with the chests and boards
I had brought on shore. That night I slept very comfort-
ably; and the next morning my thoughts were employed to
make a further attempt on the ship, and bring away what
necelsaries 1 could find, before another storm should break
her to pieces. Accordingly I got on board as before, and
prepared a second raft far more nice than the first, upon
which I brought away the carpenter's stores, two o"r three
bags full of nails, a great jack-screw, a dozen or two of
hatchets, and a grind-stone. I also took away several things
that belonged to the gunner, particularly two or three iron
crows, two barrels of musket-bullets, another fowling-piece,
a small quantity of powder, and a large bagful of small shot.
Besides these, I took all the men's clothes I could find, a
spare fore top-sail, a hammock, and some bedding; and
thus completing my second cargo, I made all the haste to
shore I could, fearing some wild beast might destroy what
I had there already. But I only found a little wild cat
sitting on one of the chests, which seeming not to fear me
or the gun that I presented at her, I threw her a piece of
biscuit, which she instantly ate and departed.
When I had gotten these effects on shore, I went to work,
in order to make me a little tent with the sail and some poles
which I had cut for that purpose; and having finished it,
what things might be damaged by the weather I brought
in, piling all the empty chests and casks in a circle, the better to fortify it against any sudden attempt of man or
beast. After this I blocked up the doors with some boards,
and an empty chest, turned the long way out. I then charged my gun and pistol, and laying my bed on the
fround, slept as comfortably, till next morning, as though I
had been in a Christian country.
Now, though I had enough to subsist me along time, yet
despairing of a sudden deliverance, or that both ammunition
and provision might be spent before such thing happened, I
coveted as much as I could; and so long as the ship re-
mained in that condition, I daily brought away one neces-
sary or other; particularly the rigging, sails, and cordage,
some twine, a barrel of wet powder, some sugar, a barrel
of meal, three casks of rum, and, what indeed was most
welcome to me, a whole hogshead of bread.
The next time I went I cut the cables in pieces, carried
off a hawser whole, with a great deal of iron-work, and
made another raft with the mizen and sprit-sajl-yard; but
this being so unwieldy, by the too heavy burden I had upon
it, and not being able so dextrously to-guide it as the former,
both my cargo and I were overturned. For my part, all
the damage I sustained was a wet skin; and, at low water,
after much labour in diving, I got most of the cables, aud
some pieces of iron.
'
Thirteen days I had now been in the island, and eleven
times on board, bringing away all that was possible; and I believe had the weather been calm, I should have brought
away the whole ship piece by piece. As I was going the
twelfth time, the wind began to rise; however, I ventured
at low water, and rummaging the cabin, in a locker I found
several razors, scifsors, and some dozens of knives and
forks; and in another thirty-six pounds of pieces of eight,
silver and gold. "Ah! simple vanity," said I, "whom
this world so much doats on, where is now thy virtue, thy
excellency to me? You cannot procure me one thing
"needful, nor remove me from this desolate island to a
place of plenty. One of these knives, so meanly esteemed,
is to me more preferable than all this heap. E'en there-
"fore remain where thou art, to sink in the deep as unre-
"garded, even as a creature whose life is not worth preserv-
"ing." Yet, after all this exclamation, 1 wrapt it up in a
piece of canvass, and began to think of making another raft:
but I soon perceived the wind began to arise, a fresh gale
blowing from the shore, and the sky overcast with clouds
and darkness; so thinking a raft to be in vain, I let myself
into the water, with what things I had about me, and it was
with much difficulty I got ashore, when soon after it blew a
fearful storm.
That night I slept very contentedly in my little tent, sur-
rounded with all my effects; but when I looked out in the
morning no more ship was to be seen. This much sur-
prised me forthe present; yet, when I considered I had lost
no time, abated no pains, and had got every thing useful
out of her, I comforted myself in the best manner, and en-
tirely submitted to the will of Providence.
My next thoughts were, how I should defend and secure
myself from savages and wild beasts, if any such were in
the island. At one time I thought of digging a cave, at
another I was for erecting a tent; and, at length, I resolved
to do both: the manner or form of which will not, I hope,
be unpleasing to describe.
When I considered the ground where I was, that it was
moorish, and had no fresh water near it, my resolutions
were to search for a soil healthy and well watered, where I
might not only be sheltered from the sun's scorching heat,
but be more conveniently situated, as well to be secured
from wild men and beasts of prey, as more easily to dis-
cover any distant sail, should it ever so happen.
And, indeed, it was not long before I had my desire. I
found a little plain near a rising hill, the front towards
which being as steep as a house-side, nothing could descend
on me from the top. On the side of this rock was a little
hollow place, resembling the entrance or door of a cave.
Just before this place, on the circle of the green, I resolved
sny tent should stand. This plain did not much exceed
a hundred yards broad, and about twice as long, like a de-
Jightfu! green before my door, with a pleasing, though an
irregular descent every way to the low grounds by the sea-
-side, lying on the N. W. side of the hill, so that it was
sheltered from the excessive heat of the sun. After this, I
drew a semicircle, containing ten yards in a semi-diameter,
and twenty yards in the whole, driving down two rows of
strong stakes, not six inches from each other. Then with a
piece of cable which I had cut on board, I regularly laid
them in a circle between the piles up to their tops, which
were more than five feet out of the earth, and after drove
another row of piles looking within side against them, be-
tween two or three feet high, which made me conclude it a
little impregnable castle against men and beasts. And for
my better security I would have no door, but entered in and
came out by the help of a ladder, which I also made.
Here was my fence and fortress, into which I carried all
my riches, ammunition and stores. After which, working
on the rock, what with dirt and stones I dug out, 1 not
only raised my ground two feet, but made a little cellar to
my mansion-house; and this cost me many days labour and
pains. One day in particular a shower or rain falling,
thunder and lightning ensued, which put me in terror lest
my powder should take fire, and not only hinder my ne-
cefsary subsistence, my killing me food, but even blow up
Bie and my habitation. To prevent which, I fell to making
boxes and bags, in order to separate it, having by me near
150lb. weight. And thus being established as king of the
island, every day I went out with my gun to see what I
could kill that was fit to eat. I soon perceived numbers of
goats, but very shy; yet having watched them narrowly,
and seeing I could better shoot off the rocks than when in
the low grounds, I happened to shoot a she goat suckling a
young kid; which not thinking its dam slain, stood by her
unconcerned: and when I took the dead creature up, the
young one followed me even to the inclosure. I lifted the
Jcid over the pales, and would willingly have kept it alive;
but finding it could not be brought to eat, I was forced to
slay it also for my subsistence.
Thus entering into as strange a scene of life as ever any
man was in, I had most melancholy apprehensions concern-
ing my deplorable condition: and many times the tears
would plentifully run down my face, when I considered
how I was debarred from all communication with human
kind. Yet while these desponding cogitations would seem
to make me accuse Providence, other good thoughts would
interpose and reprove me after this manner: Well, suppos-
ing you are desolate, is it not better to be so than totally
perish? Why were you singled out to be saved, and the rest
destroyed? Why should you complain, when not only your
life is preserved, but the ship driven even into your reach, in
order to take what was necefsary out of her for your subsistence? But to proceed. It was, by the account I kept,
the 30th of September, when I first landed on this Island.
About twelve days after, fearing least I should lose my
reckoning of time, nay, even forget the Sabbath days, for
want of pen, ink, and paper, I carved with a knife upon a
large post, in great letters, and set it up, in the similitude of
a cross, on the sea-shore where I landed, / came on shore,
Se/it. 30, 1659. Every day I cut a notch with my knife on
the sides of this square post, and that on the Sabbath was as
long again as the rest; and every first day of the month as
long again as that long one. In this manner I kept my ca-
lendar, weekly, monthly, or yearly reckoning of time. But
had I made a more strict search (as afterwards I did) I
needed not have set up this mark; for among the parcels
belonging to the gunner, carpenter, and captain's mate, I
found those very things I wanted; particularly pens, ink,
and paper; also I found two or three compafses, some ma-
thematical instruments, dials, perspective glasses, books of
navigation, three English Bibles, and several other good
books, which I carefully put up.—Here I cannot but call to
mind our having a dog and two cats on board, whom I
made inhabitants with me in my castle. Though one might
think I had all the necessaries that were desirable, yet still
I found several.things wanting. My ink was daily wasting;
I wanted needles, pins, and thread to men•* or keep my
clothes together; and particularly a spade, pickax, or
shovel, to remove the earth. It was a year before I finished my little bulwark; and having some intervals of relaxation,
after my daily wandering abroad for provision, I drew up
this plan, alternately, as creditor and debtor, to remind me
of the miseries and blessings of my life, under so many
various circumstances.
EVIL.
/ am cast upw a des'late
istand, having no hojits, no pro-
spec t of a. welcome deliverance.
. How miserable am I singled
out from the enjoyment or company
of all mankind.
Like an hermit (rather should
I say a lonety anchorite) am I
forced from human conversation.
My clothes after tome time
will be twin out; and then I
shall have none to covet me.
When my ammunition is
wasted, then shalt 1 remain
without any dtfenee against wild
men and beasts.
I have no creature, no soul
to fpe.uk to; nine to beg afsist-
ancefnm. Some ccmfoit would
it be to resound my woes where
I am understood, and beg as-
sistance•whet e 1 might hope for
relief.
GOOD.
But yet I am preserved,
while my companions are pe-
rished in the raging ocean.
Yet set apart to be spared
from death. And he, who has
so preserved me, can deliver me
ft am this condiuon.
Hotoever, I have food to eat,
and even a happy prospect of
subsistence whilst life endures.
At present I enjoy tuliaf is
absolutely needful; and the cli-
mate is so hot, that had I never
so many, I should hardly wear
tliem.
Yet if it does, I see nt dan-
ger of any hurt to me, as in
Africa: and what if 1 had
been cast away upon that coast.
Is there not God to converse
to, and is not he able to re-
lieve thee? Already has he
afforded thee sustenance, and
put it in thy power to pr'videfor
thysetf till he tends thee a de-
liverance.
And now easing my mind a little by these reflections,
I began to render my life as easy as pofsible.
I must here add, to the description I have given of my
habitation, that having raised a turf-wall against the outside
of it, I thatched it so close, as might keep it from the incle-
mency of the weather; I also improved it within, enlarged
my cave, and made a passage and door in the rock, which
came out beyond the pale of my fortification. I next pro-
ceeded to make a chair and a table, and so he^an to study
such mechanical arts as seemed to me practicable. VVbeo
I wanted a plank or board, I hewed down a tree with my
hatchet, making it as thin with my ax as possible, and then
smooth enough with an adz to answer my designs: yet
though I could make no more this way than one board out
of a tree, in length of time I got boards enough to shelter
all my stores, every thing being regularly placed, and my
guns securely hanging against the side of the rock. This
made it a very pleasant sight to me, as being the result of
vast labour and diligence; which leaving for a while, and
me to the enjoyment of it, I shall give the reader an account
of my Journal from the day of my landing, till the fixing
and settling «f my habitation, as heretofore shown.
JOURNAL.
30th, 1659, I, unhappy Robinson Crusoe,
having suffered shipwreck, was driven on this desolate
Island, which I named the Desolate Island of Despair, my
companions being swallowed up in the tempestuous ocean.
The next day I spent in consideration of my unhappy cir-
cumstances, having no prospect butof death, either to be
starved with hunger, or devoured with beasts or merciless savages.
Oct. 1. That morning, with great comfort I beheld the
ship drove ashore. Some hopes I had, that when the stc rm
was abated, I might be able to get some food and neces-
saries out of her, which I conceived were not damaged, be-
cause the ship did stand upright. At this time I lamented
the loss of my companions, and our misfortune in leaving the
vefsel. When I perceived the ship as it were lie dry, I
waded through the sands, then swam aboard, the weather
being very rainy, and with scarcely any wind.
To the 14.th of this month, my time was employed in
making voyages, every tide getting what I could out of the
ship. The weather very wet and uncertain.
Oct. 20. My raft and all the goods thereon were over-
set; yet I recovered most again at low water.
Oct. 25. It blew hard, and rained night and day, when the ship went in pieces, so that nothing was seen of her but
the wreck at low water. This day 1 stcured my goods from the inclemency of the weather.
C
Oct. 26. I wandered to see where I cquld find a place
convenient for my abode. I fixed upon a rock in the even-
ing, marked out a half-moon, intending to erect a wall^
fortified with piles, lined within with pieces of cables, and
covered with turf.
Nov. 1. I erected my tent under a rock, and took up
my lodgings very contentedly in a hammock that night. Nov. 2. This day I fenced myself in with timber, chests,
and boards.
Nov. 3. I shot two wild fowl, resembling ducks, which
were good to eat, and in the afternoon made me a table.
Nov. 4.. I began to live regularly. In the morning I
allowed myself two or three hours to walk out with my gun;
I then worked till near eleven o'clock, and afterwards re-
freshed myself with what I had to eat. From twelve to
two I would lie down to sleep. Extremely sultry weather.
In the evening go to work again.
Nov. 5. Went out with my gun and dog, shot a wild
cat with a soft skin, but her flesh was good for nothing.
The skins of those I killed, I preserved. In my return, I
perceived many wild birds, and was terrified by some seals,
which made off to sea.
Nov. 6. Completed my table.
Nov. 7. Fair weather. I worked till the 12th, but
omitted the ] 1th, which, according to my calculation, I sup-
posed to be Sunday.
Nov. 13. Rain in abundance, which, however, much cooled the air; with thunder and lightning, caused in me a terrible surprise. The weather clearing, I secured my pow-
der in separate parcels.
Nov. 14—16. I made little boxes for my powder, lodg-
ing them in several places. I also shot a large fowl, which
proved excellent meat.
Nov. 17. I began to dig in the rock, yet was obliged to
desist for want of a pickax, shovel, and wheelbarrow. Iron
crows I caused to supply the place of the first j but with all
my art I could not make a wheelbarrow.
Nov. 18. It was my fortune to find a tree, resembling
vvhat Brazilians call an iron-tree. I had like to have spoiled
my ax with cutting it, being very hard and exceedingly
heavy; yet with much labour and industry, I made a sort,
qf a'spade out of it.
Nov. 23. These tools being made, I daily carried on my
business; eighteen days I allowed for enlarging my cave,
that it might serve me, not only for a warehouse, but kit-
chen, parlour, and cellar. I commonly lay in the tent, un-
lefs the weather was rainy that I could not lie dry. So wet
would it be at certain seasons, that I was obliged to cover
all within the pale with long poles, in the form of rafters,
leaning against the rock, and loaded them with flags and
large leaves of trees, resembling a thatch.
Dec. 10. No sooner did I think my habitation finished,
but suddenly a great deal of the top broke in, so that it was
a mercy I was not buried in the ruins. This occasioned a
great deal of pains and trouble tome, before I could make it firm and durable.
Dec. 17. I nailed up some shelves, and drove nails and
staples in the wall and posts, to hang things out of the way.
Dec. 20 Evey thing I got into its place, then made a sort
of a dresser, and another table. Dec. 24, 25. Rain in abundance. Dec. 26. Very fair weather.
Dec. 27. I chanced to light on some goats, shot one, and
wounded another. I led it home in a string, bound up its
leg, and cured it in a little time; at length it became so
tame and familiar as to feed before the door, and follow me where I pleased. This put me in mind to bring up tame
creatures, in order to supply me with food after my ammunition was spent.
Dec. 28, 29,30. The weather being excefsively hof,
with little air, obliged me for the most part, to keep within
doors.
Jan. 1. Still sultry, however, obliged by necessity, I went
out with my gun, and found a great store of goats in the valleys; they were exceedingly shy, nor could my dog
hunt them down.
Jan. 3 to 14. My employment this time was to finish the
wall before described, and search the island. I discovered
a kind of pigeons, like our house pigeons, in a nest among the
rocks. I brought them home, nursed them till they coulil
fly, and then they left me. After this, I shot some, which.
proved excellent food. Some time I spent vainly in con-
triving to make a cask; I may well say it was vain, because
I could neither joint the staves, nor fix the heads, so as to
make it tight: So, leaving that, took some goat's talloyv .I
had about me, and a little oakum for the wick, and provided.
myself with a lamp, which served me instead of candles.
Cr '. J
But now a very strange event happened. For being in
the height of my search, what should come into my hand,
but a bag, which used to hold corn (as I supposed) for the
fowls; so immediately resolving to put gunpowder in it, I
shook all the husks and dirt upon one side of the rock, little
expecting what the consequence would be. The rain had
fallen plentifully a few days before: and about a month
after, to my great amazement, something began to look out
very green and flourishing; and when I came to view it
more nicely every day as it grew, I found about ten or
twelve ears of green barley appeared in the very same
shape and make as that in England
1 can scarce exprefs the agitations of my mind at this
sight. Hitherto, I had looked upon the actions of this life
no otherwise than only as the events of blind chance and
fortune. But now the appearance of this barley, flourishing
in a barren soil, and my ignorance in not conceiving how it
should come there, made me conclude, that miracles were not
yet ceastd.: nay, I even thought that God had appointed it
to grow there without any seed, purely for my sustenance
in this miserable and desolate island. And indeed such
great effect this had upon me, that it often made me melt
into tears, through a grateful sense of God's mercies; and
the greater still was my thankfulnefs, when I perceived
about this little field of barley some rice stalks, also wonder-
fu:ly flourishing.
While thus pleased in mind, I concluded there must be
more corn in the island; and therefore made a diligent
search narrowly among the rocks; but not being able to
find a-iy, on a sudden it came into mind, how I had shaken
the husks of corn out of the bag, and then my admiration
ceased, with my gratitude to the Divine Being, as thinking
it iua.: but natural, and not to be conceived a miracle; though
even the manner of its preservation might have made me
own it was a wonderful event of God's kind Providence.
It was about the latter end of June when the ears of
this corn ripened, which I laid up very carefully together
with 20 or 30 stalks of rice, expecting one day I should reap
the fruit of my labour; yet four years were expired be-
fore I could allow myself to eat any barley bread, and much
longer time before I had any rice. After this, with indefa-
tigable pains and industry, for three or four months, at last I
fimshed my wall on the 14th of April, having no way to go
into it, but by a ladder against the wall.
April n. I finished my ladder, and ascended it; after-
wards pulled it up, then let it down on the other side, and
descended into my new habitation, where I had space
enough, and so fortified that nothing could attack me with-
out scaling the walls.
But what does all human pains and industry avail, if the
blessing of God does not crown our labours? Or who can
stand before the Almighty, when he stretcheth forth his arm?
For one time as I was at the entrance of my cave, there hap-
pened such a dreadful earthquake, that not only the roof of
the cave came tumbling about my ears, but the posts seemed
to crack terribly at the same time. This put me in great
amazement; and running to the ladder, and getting over the
wall, I then plainly knew it was an earthquake; the place I
stood on sustained three terrible shocks in less than three
minutes. But judge of my terror when I saw the top of a
great rock roll into the sea; I then expected the island would
be swallowed up every moment: and what made the scene
still more dreadful, was to see the sea thrown into the most
violent agitations arid disorders by this tremendous accident.
For my part, I stood like a criminal at the place of execu-
tion, ready to expire. At the moving of the earth, I was, .
as it were, sea-sick; and very much afraid lest the rock,
under which was my fence and habitation, should over-
whelm it and myself in a lasting tomb.
When the third dreadful shock had spent itself, my spirits began to revive; yet still I would not venture to ascend
the ladder, but continued sitting, not knowing what I should
do. So little grace had I then, as only to say, Lard have
mercy upon me! and no sooner was the earthquake over, but
that pathetic prayer left me.
It was not long after, when a horrible tempest arose, at the same time attended with a hurricane of wind. The sea
seemed mountains high, and the waves rolled so impetuously,
that nothing could be perceived but froth and foam. Three
hours did this storm continue, and in so violent a manner, as
to tear the very trees up by the roots, which was succeeded by abundance of rain. When the tempest was over, I went
to my tent: but the rain coming on in a furious manner, I was obliged to take shelter in the cave, where I was forced
to cut a channel through my fortification to let the water out.
It continued raining all that night, and some time the next
day. These accidents made me resolve, as soon as the C3
weather cleared up, to build me a little hut in some open
place, walled round to defend me from wild creatures and
savages; not doubting but at the next earthquake, the
mountain would fall upon my habitation and me, and swal-
low up all in its bowels.
April 16—20. These days I spent in contriving how
and in what manner I should fix my place of abode. All
this while I was under the most dreadful apprehensions.—When I looked round my habitation, every thing I found in
its proper place. I had several resolutions whether I should
move or not; but at length resolved to stay where I was, till
I found out a convenient place where I might pitch my tent.
April 22. When I began to put my resolution in prac-
tice, I was stopt for want of tools and instruments to work
with. Most of my axes and hatchets were useless, occa-
sioned by cutting the hard timber that grew on the island.
It took me up a full week to make my grindstone of use to
me, and at last I found out a way to turn it about with my
foot, by help of a wheel and a string.
April 28, 29. These days were spent in grinding my tools.
April 30. My bread falling short, 1 allowed myself but
one biscuit a day.
May 1. As I walked along the sea-shore, I found a barrel
of gunpowder, and several pieces of the wreck, the sea had
flung up. Having secured those, I made to the ship, whose
stern was tore off, and washed a great distance ashore; but
the rest lay in the sands. This I supposed was occasioned
by the earthquake. I now resolved to keep my old place
of abode: and also to go to the ship that day, but then
found it impossible.
May 3. This day I went on board, and with my saw
«awed off' one of the beams, which kept the quarter-deck.
I then cleared the sand till flood.
May 4. I caught some fish, but they were not wholesome.
The same day I also catched a young dolphin.
May 5. This day 1 also fepaired to the wreck, and sawed
another piece of timber, and when the flood came, I made
a float of three great planks, which were driven ashore by
the tide.
May 6, 7, 8, 9. These days I brought off the iron bolts,
opened the deck with the iron crow, and carried two planks
to land, having made a way into the very middle of the
wreck.
May 10, II, 12, 13, 14.. All this time I spent in bringing
off great quantities of iron and timber.
May 15. Took with me two hatchets on purpose to cut
nff some lead from the roll, but all in vain; for it lay too
low under water.
May 16, I omitted going to the wreck this day, for em-
ploying myself to look for pigeons, I outstayed my time.
May 17. I perceived several pieces of the wreck driven
ashore, which I found belonged to the head of the ship. May 24. To this day I worked on the wreck, and with
great difficulty loosened some things so much with the crow,
that at the first flowing tide, several casks floated out, and
many of the seamen's chests; yet that day nothing came to
land but pieces of timber, and a hogshead which had some
Brazil pork in it. I continued working to the lothof June;
(except necessary time for food or rest) and, had I known
how to have built a boat, I had timber and planks enough:
I had also near 100 weight of sheet lead.
June 16. As I was wandering towards the sea-side, I
found a large tortoise or turtle, being the first I had seen on
the island; though, as I afterwards found, there were many
on the other side of it.
June 17. This day I spent in cooking it, found in her
threescore eggs, and her flesh the most savoury and pleasant
I ever tasted in my life.
June 18. I staid within this day, there being a continual
rain: and it was somewhat more chilly and cold than usual.
June 19. Exceedingly bad, being taken with a trembling
and shivering.
June 20. Awake all night, my head racked with pain and
feverish.
June 21. Sick unto death, and terrified with the dismal
apprehensions of my condition. Prayed to God more fre-
quently, but very confusedly.
June 22. Something better, but still uneasy in my mind.
June 23. Again relapsed much as before.
June 24. Mended a second time.
June 25. A violent ague for seven hours, cold and hot
fits succeeded with faint sweats.
June 26. Better, but very weak, yet I scrambled out, shot
a she-goat, brought it home and boiled some of it; I would
willingly have stewed it, and made some broth, but had no
pot.
3€ LITE Aftft AbVKNTVRES
June 27. All this day I was afflicted with an ague;
thirsty, yet could not help myself to water: Prayed to God
in these words: "Lord, in pity look upon me: Lord have
mercy upon me: have mercy upon me!" After this [
fell asleep, which I found had much refreshed me, when I
awaked. I fell fast asleep a second time, and fell into this
strange and terrible sort of dream.
Methought I was sitting on the same spot of ground at the
outside of the wall where I sat when the storm blew after
the earthquake; and that I saw a man descending from a
great black cloud, and alight upon the ground. He was all
over as bright as a flash of fire that a little before surrounded
him; his countenance inconceivably terrible; the earth, as
it were, trembled when he stept upon the ground, and flashes
of fire seemed to fill all the air. No sooner, I thought, he
landed upon the earth, but with a long spear, or other wea-
pon, he made towards me; but first ascending a rising
ground, his voice added to my amazement, when I thought
I heard him pronounce these dreadful words, "Unhappy
"wretch! seeing all these things have not brought thee to
"repentance, thou shalt immediately die." In pronouncing
this dreadful sentence, I thought he meant to kill me with the spear that was in his hand.
Any body may think it impossible for me to exprefs th£
horrors of my mind at this vision: and even when I awaked,
this very dream made a deep impression upon my mind.—
The little divine knowledge I had, I received from my fa-
ther's instructions, and that was worn out by an uninter-
rupted series of sea. faring impiety for eight years space. Ex-
cept what sickness forced from me, I do not remember-I had
once thought of lifting up my heart towards God, but rather
had a certain stupidity of soul, not having the least sense ot
fear of the Omnipotent Being when in distress, nor of gra-
titude to him for his deliverances. Nay, when I was on the
desperate expedition on the desert African shore,*"! cannot
remember I had one thought of what would become of me,
or to beg his consolation and assistance in my sufferings and
distrefs. When the Portugal captain took me up, and ho-
nourably used me, nay, farther, when I was even delivered
from drowning, by escaping to this island, I never looked
upon it as a judgment, but only said I was an unfortunate
dog, and that's,all. Indeed, some secret transports of soul I
had, which was not through grace, but only a common flight of joy, that I was yet alive, when my companions were all
drowned, and no other joy could I conceive but what is
common with the sailors over a bowl of punch, after they
have escaped the greatest dangers.
The likelihood of wanting for neither food nor conveni-
ences, might have called upon me for a thankful acknow-
ledgment to Providence. Indeed the growth of my corn
touched me with some sense; but that soon wore off again.
The terrible earthquake pointed to me, as it were, the fin-
ger of God, but my dreadful amazement continued no longer
than its duration. Butnow, when my spirits began to sink
under the burden of a strong distemper, and I could leisurely
view the miseries of death present themselves before my
eyes, then my awakened conscience began to reproach me
with my past life, in which I had so wickedly provoked the
justice of God to pour down his vengeance upon me.
Such reflections as these,opprefsed me even in the violence
ofdistempen Some prayers I uttered, which only proceeded
from the fear of death. But when I considered my father's
advice and prophecy, I could not forbear weeping: for he
told me, " That if I did persist in my folly, I should not only
be deprived of God's blefsing, but have time enough to
•' reflect upon my despising his instructions, and this in a
wretched time, when none could help me." And now
concluding it to be fulfilled, having no soul in the island to
administer any comfort to me, I prayed earnestly to the
Lord, that he would help me in this my great calamity.—And this, I think, was the first time I prayed in sincerity for
many years. But now I must return to my journal.
June 28. Something refreshed with sleep, and the fit
quite off, I got up. My dream still occasioned in me a great
consternation; and, fearing that the ague might return the
succeeding day, 1 concluded it time to getsometliing to com-
fort me. I filted a case-bottle with water, and set it within
reach of my bed; and, to make it more nourishing and lels
rhilly, I put some rum in it. The next thing I did was to
broil me a piece of goat's flesh, of which I ate but little; I
was very weak; however, walked about, dreading the return
of my distemper; and at night I supped on three of the
turtle's eggs, which I roasted and ate, begging God's bles-
sing therewith.
After I had eaten, I attempted to walk again out of doors
with my gun; but was so weak, that I sat down, and look-
ed at the sea, which was smooth and calm. While I con-
tinued here, these thoughts came into my mind.
In what manner is the production of the earth and sea, ot
which I have seen so much? From whence came myself,
and all other creatures living, and of what are they made?
Our beings were assuredly created by some almighty in-
visible Power, who framed the earth, the sea, and air, and
all therein. But what is that Power?
Certainly it must follow that God has created it all. Yet,
said I, if God has made all this, he must be the Ruler of
them all, and what is relating thereto; for certainly the
Power that makes, must indisputably have a power to guide
and direct them. And if this be so, (as certainly it must)
nothing can happen without his knowledge and appoint-
ment. Then, surely, if nothing happens without God's ap-
pointment, certainly God has appointed these my sufferings
to befal me. And here I fixed my firm belief that it was
his will that it should be so; and then proceeded to inquire, why should God deal with me in this manner? Or what
have I done thus to deserve his indignation?
Here conscience flew in my face, reprehending me as a
blasphemer; crying with a loud and piercing voice, "Un-
"worthy wretch! how dare you ask what you have done?
Look on your past life, and see what you have left undone?
"Ask thyself, why thou wert not long ago in the mercilels
"hands of death? Why not drowned in Yarmouth roads,
or killed in the fight, when the ship was taken by the
"Salee man of war? Why not entombed in the bowels of
"wild beasts on the African coast, or drowned here when
all thy companions suffered shipwreck in the ocean f
Struck dumb with these reflections, I rose up in a pen-
sive manner, being so thoughtful that I could not go to
sleep; and fearing the dreadlul return of my distemper, it
caused me to remember, that the Brazilians use tobacco for
almost all diseases. I then went to my chest in order to
find some, where Heaven, no doubt, directed me to find a
cure for both soul and body; for there I found one of the
Bibles, which, till this time, I had neither leisure nor incli-
nation to look into. I took both the tobacco and that out of
the chest, and laid them on the table. Several experiments
did I try with the tobacco: First, I took a piece of leaf, and
chewed it; but it being very green and strong, almost
stupified me. Next I steeped it in some cum an hour ot
two, resolving when I went to bed to take a dose of it:
and in the third place, I burnt some over a pan of fire,
holding my nose over it as long as I could endure it with-
out suffocation.
In the intervals of this operation, though my head was
giddy and disturbed by the tobacco, I took up the Bible to
read. No sooner did I open it, but there appeared to me
these words, "Call on me in the day of trouble, and I will
deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify me."
At first, this sentence made a very deep imprefsion on
my heart, but it soon wore off again, when I considered the
word deliver was foreign to me. And as the children of
Israel said, when they were promised flesh to eat, "Can
God spread a table in the wildernefs?" In like manner I
began to say, " Can Godhimself deliver me from this deso-
late island?" However the words would still return to my
mind, and afterwards made a greater imprefsion upon me.
As it was now very late, and the tobacco had dozed my
head, I was inclined to sleep; but before I would lie down
I fell on my knees, and implored the promise that God had
made me in the Holy Scriptures, that " if I called upon him
in the day of trouble, he would deliver me." With much
difficulty, i afterwards drank the rum, wherein I had steeped
the tobacco, which flying into my head, threw me into such
a profound sleep, that it was three o'clock the next day before
I awaked; or rather, I believe, I slept two days, having cer-
tainly lost a day in my account, and I could never tell any
other way. When I got up, my spirits were lively and
cheerful; my stomach much better, being very hungry;
and, in short, no fit returned the next day, which was the
29th, but 1 found myself much altered for the better.
The 30th I went abroad with my gun, but not far, and
killed a sea-fowl or two, resembling a brand goose, which,
however, I cared not to eat when I brought them home,
but dined on two more of the turtle's eggs. In the evening
I renewed my medicine, excepting that I did not take so
large a quantity, neither did I chew the leaf, or hold my
head over the smoke: but the next day, which was the 1st
of July, having a little return of the cold fit, I again took
my medicine as I did the first time.
July 3. The fit quite left me, but very weak. In this
condition, I often thought of these words, "1 will deliver
thee;" and while, at some times, I would think of the im-
pofsibilily of it, other thoughts would reprehend me for dis-
regarding the deliverances I had received, even from the
most foriornand distressed condition. I asked myself, what
regard have I had to God for his abundant mercies? Have
I done my part?" He has delivered me, but I have not
glorified him:"—as if I had said, I had not owned and
been thankful for these as deliverances, and how could I
expect greater? So much did this sensibly touch my heart,
that I gave God thanks for my recovery from sickness in
the most humble prostration.
July 4. This morning I began seriously to ponder on what
is written in the New Testament, resolving to read a chap-
ter every morning and night as long as my thoughts would
engage me. As soon as I set about this work seriously, I
found my heart deeply affected with the impiety of my past
life; these words that I thought were spoken to me in my
dream, revived, " All these things have not "brought thee to
repentance." After this, I begged of God to assist me
with his Holy Spirit in returning to my duty. One day, in
perusing the Scriptures, I came to these words, "Him hath
God exalted to be a Prince and a Saviour, to give repentance
and to give remifsion:" immediately I laid down the
book, and with uplifted hands to Heaven, loudly cried, " O
blefsed Jesus, thou son of David, Jesus, thou exalted Prince
and Saviour, give me repentance!" And now indeed I prayed
with a true sense of my condition, and a more certain hope,
founded on the word of God. Now I had a different sense
of these words, " Call on me and I will deliver thee," that
is, from the dreadful load of guilt which oppressed my sinful
soul, and not from a solitary life, which might rather be
called a blessing, seeing I wanted neither food nor rai-
ment, when compared with living among the human race,
surrounded with so much opprefsion, misery, and affliction:
In a word, I came to this conclusion, that a deliverance
from sin was a much greater blefsing, than a deliverance
friim affliction. But again I proceed to my journal. To the 14ih of July. 1 walked about with my gun, little
and little at a time, having been reduced to the greatest
extremity of weakness. The applications and experiments
I used, were perfectly new: neither could I recommend
them to any one's practice. For, though it carried off the
iit, it very much weakened me, and I had frequent convul-
sions in my.nerves and limbs lor some time. From this, I learned, that going abroad in rainy weather, especially when
it was attended with storms and hurricanes of wind, was
most pernicious to health. I had now been about ten
months in the island; and, as I never had seen any of the
human kind, 1 therefore accounted myself as sole monarch;
and as I grew better, having secured my habitation to my
mind, I resolved to make a tour round my kingdom, in or-
der to make new discoveries.
The 15th of July, I began my journey; I first went to
the creek, where I had brought my rafts on shore; and, tra-
velling farther, found that the tide went no higher than two
miles up, where there was a little brook of running water,
on the bank of which were many pleasant savannahs or
meadows, plain, smooth, and covered with grafs. On the
rising parts, where I supposed the water did not reach, I
perceived a great deal of tobacco growing to a very strong
stalk. Several other plants I likewise found, the virtues of
which I did not understand. I searched along time for the
Cafsava root, which I knew the Indians in that climate
made their bread of, but all in vain. There were several
plants of aloes, though at that time I knew not what they were; likewise I saw several sugar canes, but imperfect for
want of cultivation. With these few discoveries, I came
back that night, and slept contentedly in my little castle.
The next day, being the 16th, going the same way, but
farther than the day before, I found the country more a Jorned
with woods and trees. Here I perceived different fruits in
great abundance. Melons in plenty lay on the ground, and
clusters of grapes, ripe and very rich, spread over the trees. You may imagine I was glad of this discovery, yet ate very sparingly, lest 1 should throw myself into a flux or fever.
The grapes I found of excellent use; for when I had dried
them in the sun, which preserved them as dried raisins are
kept, they proved very wholesome and nourishing, and
served me in these seasons when no grapes were to be had.
The night drawing on apace, I ascended up a tree, and
slept very comfortably, though it was the first time I had
lain out of my habitation. And when the morning came, I
proceeded with great pleasure on my way, travelling about
iour miles, as I imagined, by the length of the valley, di-
iccting my course northward, there being a ridge of hills on
the south and north side of me. At the end of this D
I came to an opening, where the country seemed to descend
to the west; there I found a little spring of fresh water,
proceeding out of the side of the hill, with its crystal streams
running directly east. And, indeed, here my senses were
charmed with the most beautiful landscape nature could af-
ford; for the country appeared flourishing, green, and de-
lightful; that to me it seemed like a planted garden. I then
descended on the side of that delicious vale, when I found
abundance of cocoa, orange, lemon and citron trees, but very wild and barren at that time. As for the limes, they
were delightful and wholesome, the juice of which I after
used to mix in water, which made it very cooling and re-
freshing. And now I was resolved to carry home and lay
up a store of grapes, limes, and lemons, against theapproach-ing wet season. So laying them up in several parcels, and
then taking a few of each with me, I returned to my little
castle, after having spent three days in this journey. Before
] got home, the grapes were so bruised that they were
utterly spoiled; the limes, indeed, were good; but of those
I could bring only a few.
July 19. Having prepared two bags, I returned thither
again, but, to my great surprise, found all the grapes spread
about, trod to pieces, tind abundance eaten, which made me
conclude there were wild beasts thereabouts. To prevent
this happening again, I gathered a large quantity of the
grapes, and hung them upon the out-branches of the tree,
both to keep them unhurt, and that they might cure and dry
in the sun: and having well loaded myself with limes and
itmons, 1 returned once more to my old place of residence.
And now contemplating on the iruitfulnels of this valley,
and pleasantnels of its situation, its security from storms,
and the delightfuinefs of the adjacent woods, I concluded
I was settled in the worst part of the country, and there-
lore was thinking to remove my habitation.
But when I considered again, that, though it was pleasant,
it was off from the sea-side, where there was a possibility, some time or other, a ship might either be driven or sail by;
and, that to inclose myself among hills and woods, must cer-
tainly put an end to my hopes of deliverance; I resolved
to let my castle remain where Providence had first aisigned
it. Vet so ravished was I with this place, that I made me
a little kind of bower, surrounding it with a double hedge,
as high as I could reach. Well staked and filled with bail-
rushes: and having spent a great part of the month of July,
I think it was the first of August before I began to enjoy
my labour.
Aug. 3. Perceiving my grapes to be dry, I took them from
the trees, and they proved excellent good raisins of the sun:
the most of which I carried to my cave; and happy for me
I did so; by which I saved the best part of my winter food.
Aug. 14. This day it began to rain; and though I had
made me a tent like the other, yet having no shelter ot'a hill
to keep me from storms, nor a cave behind me to retreat to,
I was obliged to return to my old castle. The rain con-
tinued more or less every day, till the middle of October;
and sometimes so violent, that I could not stir out of my
cave for several days. This season I found my family to
increase; for one of my cats that ran away from me, and
which I thought had been dead, returned about August,
with three kittens at her heels, like herself, which I thought
strange, because both my cats were females, and the wild
cats of the island seemed to be of a different kind from our
European cats; but from these cats proceeded such num-
bers, that I was forced to kill and destroy them as I would
do wild beasts and vermine.
To the 26ih of this month, I could not stir out, it raining
incefsantly; when beginning to want food, I was compelled
to venture twice; the first of whick 1 shot a goat, and af-
terwards found a very large tortoise. The manner of my regulating my food was thus: a bunch of raisins served ma
for my breakfast, a piece of goat's Mesh, or turtle, boiled, for
my dinner, and two or three turtle's eggs for my supper.
While the rain lasted, I daily worked two or three hours at
enlarging my cave, and by degrees worked it on towards
one side, till I came to the outside of the hill, and made a
door or way out, which came beyond my fence or wall, and
so I came in and out this way. But after I had done this, I
was troubled to see myself thus exposed; though I could
not perceive any thing to fear, a goat being the biggest
creature I had seen upon this island.
Sept. 30. Casting up my notches on my post, which
amounted to 365, I concluded this to be the anniversary of
my landing; and, therefore, humbly prostrating myself on
the ground, confefsing my sins, acknowledging God's
righteous judgments upon me, and praying to Jesus Christ
to have mercy upon me, I fasted for twelve hours till the D2
going down of the sun; and then eating a biscuit and a
bunch of grapes, laid me on the bed, and with great comfort
took my night's repose. Till this time, I never had distin-
guished the Sabbath-day: but now I made a longer notch
than ordinary for the days of rest, and divided the week as
well as I could, though I found I had lost a day or two in
my account. My ink failing soon after, I omitted in my
daily memorandum, things of an indifferent nature, and con-
tented myself to write down only the most remarkable events
of my life. The rainy and dry seasons appeared now regular
to me, and experience taught me how to provide for them;
yet,in one thing I am going to relate, myexperience very
much failed me. You may call to mind what I have men-
tioned of some barley and rice, which I had saved; about
thirty stalks of the former and twenty of the latter: and, at
that time, the sun being in its southern position, going from
me, together with the rains, made me conclude it a very
proper season to sow it. Accordingly I dug up a piece of
ground with my wooden spade, and divided it into two
parts, sowed about two thirds of my seed, preserving by
me about a handful each. And happy it was I did so; for
no rains falling, it was choaked up, and never appeared
above the earth till the wet season came again; and then
part of it grew as if it had been newly sown.
I was resolved still to make another trial; and seeking
for a moister piece of ground near my bower, I there sowed
Ihe rest of my seed in February, a little before the vernal
equinox; which having the rainy months of March and
April to water it, yielded a noble crop, and sprang up very
pleasantly. 1 had still saved part of the seed, not daringto
venture all; and by the time I found out the proper seasons
to sow it in, and that I might expect every year two seed-
-times and two harvests, my stock amounted to above half a
peck of each sort of grain.
No sooner were the rains over, but the stakes which I had
cut from the trees, shot out like willows, the first year after
lopping their heads. I was ignorant of the tree I cut them
from: but they grew so regularly beautiful, that they made
a most lively appearance, and so flourished in three years
time, that I resolved to cut more of them; and these soon
growing, madeaglorious fence, as afterwards I shall observe.
And now I perceived that the seasons of the year might
generally be divided not into summer and winter, as in
Europe, but into wet and dry seasons, as in this manner:

V.February,
The wet season would continue longer or shorter, as the
winds happened to blow. But having found the ill conse-
quences of being abroad in the rain, I took care beforehand
to furnish myself with provisions; and, during the wet
months, sat within doors as much as possible. At this time I
contrived to make many things that I wanted, though it cost
me much labour and pains, before I could accomplish them.
The first 1 tried was to make a basket, but all the twigs I
could get proved so brittle, that I could not then perform it.
It now proved of great advantage to me, that, when a boy, I
took a great delight at standing at a basket-maker's in the
same town where my father lived, to view them at work;
and like other boys, curious to see the manner of their
working these things, and very officious to assist, I perfectly
learned the method of it, and wanted nothing but the tools.
And it coming into my mind, that the twigs of that tree. of
of which I made my stakes, might be as tough as a sallow-
willow or-osiers, growing in England, I resoved to make an experiment, and went the next day to my country-seat, and found some fit for my turn; and after cutting down a
quantity with my hatchet, I dried them in my pale, and,
when fit to work with, carried them to my cave, where I
employed myself in making several sorts of baskets, inso-
much that I could put in whatsoever I pleased. It is true,
they were not cleverly made, yet they served my turn upon all occasions.
D 3
But still I wanted two necessary things. I had no cask
to hold my liquor, except two runlets almost full of rum, a
few bottles of an ordinary size, and some square case bottles;
neither had I a pot to boil any thing in, only a large kettle
unfit to make broth, or stew a bit of meat: I wanted like-
wise at the beginning of this dry season, a tobacco pipe;
but for this I afterwards found an expedient.
I kept myself employed in planting my second row of
stakes. But remembering that when I travelled up to the
brook, I had a mind to see the whole island, I now resumed
my intention; and taking my dog, gun, hatchet, two biscuit
cakes, a great bunch of raisins, with a larger quantity of
powder and shot than usual, I began my journey. Having
passed the vale where my bower stood, I came within view
of the sea, lying to the west; when it being a clear day, I
riirly descried land, extending from the W. to the S. W.
about ten or fifteen leagues, as I concluded; but could not
say whether it was an island or a continent. Neither
could I tell what this place might be; only thought it was
part of America, and where I might have been in a miser-
able condition, had I landed. Again, I considered, that if
this was the Spanish coast, certainly one time or other, I
should see some ship pass by; and if it was not, then it
must be the savage coast, between the Spanish country and
Brazil, which abounds with cannibals or man-eaters.
As I proceeded forward, I found this side of the island
much more pleasant than mine; Ihe fields fragrant, adorned
with sweet flowers and verdant grass, together with several
very fine woods. There were parrots in plenty, which
made me long for one to be my companion; but it was with
great difficulty I could knock one down with my stick; and
I kept him at home some years before I could get him to
call me by my name.
In the low grounds, I found various sorts of hares and
foxes, as I took them to be, but much different from those in
England. Several of these I killed, but never ate them;
neither, indeed, had I any occasion; for abounding with
goats, pigeons, turtle, and grapes, I could defy Leadenhall
market to furnish me a better table. In this journey, I did
not travel above two miles a day, because I took several
turns and windings, to see what discoveries I could make,
returning weary enough to the place where I designed to
rest all night, which was either in a tree, or in a piace
which I surrounded with stakes, that no wild creature might
suddenly surprise me. When I came to the sea-shore, I was
amazed to see the splendor of it. Its strand was covered
with shells of the most beautiful fish, and constantly abound-
ing with innumerable turtles, and fowls of many kinds,
which I was ignorant of, except those called penguins. I
might have shot as many as I pleased, but was sparing of
my ammunition; rather choosing to kill a she-goat, which I
did with much difficulty, on account of the flatnefs of the
country.
Now though this journey produced me the most pleasing
satisfaction, yet my habitation was so much to my liking,
that I did not repine at my being seated on the worst part
of the island. I continued my journey, travelling about
twelve miles further towards the east, where I set a great
pile on the shore for a mark, concluding that my next jour-
ney should bring me to the other side of the island, east from
my castle, and so round till I came to my post again. As I
had a constant view of the country, I thought I could not
miss my way; but scarce had I travelled three miles, when
I descended into a very large valley, so surrounded with
hills covered with wood, that I having no guide but the sun,
nor even this, unless I knew well the position at the time at
that time of the day: and, to add to my misfortune, the wea-
ther proving very hazy, 1 was obliged to return to my post
by the seaside, and so backwards the same way I came.—
In this journey my dog surprised a kid, and would have
killed it, had I not prevented him. As I had often been
thinking of getting a kid or two, and so raising a breed of
tame goats to supply me after my ammunition was spent, I
took this opportunity of beginmng: and having made a
collar for this little creature, with a string made of rope-
yarn, I brought it to my bower, and there inclosed and left
him; and having spent a month in this journey, at length
I returned to my own habitation.
Nobody can doubt of my satisfaction, when I returned to
my little castle, and reposed myself in my hammock. After
my journey, I rested myself a week, which time I employed
in making a cage for my pretty Poll. I now began to
consider my poor kid I had left in the bower, and I imme-
diately went to fetch it home. When I came there, 1 found
the young creature almost starved; I gave it some food, and
tied it as before: but there was no occasion, for it followed -
me like a dog; and, as I constantly fed it, it became so
loving, gentle, and fond, that it commenced one of my do-
mestics, and would never leave me.
The rainy season of the autumnal equinox being now
come, I kept the"30th of September in the most solemn
manner, as usual; it being the third year of my abode in
the island. I spent the whole day in acknowledging God's
mercies, in giving him thanks for making this solitary life as
agreeable and lefs sinful, that that of human society; and
for the communications of his grace to my soul, in support-
ing, comforting, and encouraging me to depend upon his
Providence, and hope for his eternal presence in the world
to come.
Indeed, I often did consider how much more happy I was
in this state of life, than in that accursed manner of living I
formerly used; and sometimes when hunting, or viewing the country, the anguish of my soul would break out upon
me, and my very heart would sink within me, to think of the
woods, the mountains, the deserts I was in; and how I was
a prisoner locked up within the eternal bars and bolts of the
ocean, in an uninhabited wildernefs, without hopes, and
without redemption. In this condition I would often wring
my hands, and weep like a child: and even sometimes, in
the middle of my work, this fit would take me; and then I
would sit down and sigh, looking on the ground for an hour
or two together, till such time as my grief got vent in a flood
of tears.
One morning as I was sadly employed in this manner, I
opened my Bible, when I immediately fixed my eyes upon
these words, "1 will never leave thee, nor forsake thee!"
Surely, thought I, these words are directed to me,or else why
should they appear just at a moment when I am bemoaning my forlorn condition? and if God does not forsake, what
matters it, since he can make me more"happy in this state of
life, than if I enjoyed the greatest splendour in the world?
But while I was going to return God thanks for my present
state, something seemed to shock my mind, as if it had thus
said: Unworthy wrqtch, can you pretend to be thankful
for a condition from Which you would pray to be delivered!
Here I stopt;—and though I could not say, I thanked the
Divine Majesty for being there, yet I gave God thanks for
placing to my view my former course of life, and granting
me a true knowledge of repentance. And whenever 1 opened
49
wr shut the Bible, I blessed kind Providence, that directed
my good friend in England to send it among my goods with-
out any order, and for assisting me to save it from the power
of the raging ocean.
And now beginning my third year, my several daily em-
ployments were these: First, My duty to Heaven, and di-
ligently reading the Holy Scriptures; which I did twice or thrice every day: Secondly, Seeking provisions with my gun,
which commonly took me up, when it did not rain, three
hours every morning: Thirdly, The ordering, curing, pre-
serving and cooking what I killed, or catched for my sup-
ply, which took me up great part of the day: for, in the
middle of the day, the sun being in its height, it was so hot,
that I could not stir out; so that I had only but four hours
in the evening to work in: and then the want of tools, of
assistance, and skill, wasted a great deal of time to little
purpose. I was no less than two and forty days making a
board fit for a long shelf, which two sawers, with their
tools and saw-pit, would have cut off the same tree in
half a day. It was of a large tree, as my board was to be
broad. I was three days in cutting it down, and two more
in lopping off the boughs, and reducing it to a piece of tim-
ber. This 1 hacked and hewed off each side, till it became
light to move; and then I turned it, made one side of it
smooth and flat as a board from end to end, then turned it
downwards, cutting the other side, till I brought the plank
to be about three inches thick, and smooth on both sides.
Any body may judge my great labour and fatigue in such a
piece of work; but this I went through with patience, as
also many other things that my circumstances made neces-
sary for me to do.
The harvest months, November and December, were
now at hand, in which I had the pleasing prospect of a very
good crop. But here I met with a new misfortune; for
the goats and hares, having tasted of the sweetness of the
blade, kept it so short, that it had not strength to shoot up
into a stalk. To prevent this, I inclosed it with a hedge,
and by day shot some of its devourers; and my dog which I
had tied to the field-gate, keeping barking all night, so
frightened those creatures, that I got entirely rid of them.
But no sooner did I get rid of these, than other enemies
appeared, to wit, whole flocks of several sorts of birds who
only waited till my back was turned, to ruin me. So much did this provoke me, that I let fly, and killed three of the
malefactors; and afterwards served them as they do notori-
ous thieves in England, hung them up in chains, as a terror
to others. And, indeed, so good an effect had this, that they
not only forsook the corn, but all that part of the island, so
long as these criminals hung there.
My corn having ripened apace, the latter end of Decem-
ber, which was my second harvest, I reaped it with a scythe,
made of one of my broad swords. I had no fatigue in cut-
ting down my first crop, it was so slender. The ears I car-
ried home in a basket, rubbing it with my hands, instead of
thrashing it; and when the harvest was over, found nay
half peck of seed produced near two bushels of rice and
two bushels and a half of barley. And now I plainly fore-
saw, that, by God's goodnefs, I should be furnished with
bread; but yet I was concerned, because I knew not how
to grind or make meal of my corn, or bread, neither knew
how to bake it. I would not, however, taste any of the
crop, but resolved to preserve it against next season, and,
in the mean while, use my best endeavours to provide my-
self with other food.
But where were my labours to end? The want of a
plough to turn up the earth, or shovel to dig it, I conquered
by making me a wooden spade. The want of a harrow I
supplied myself with dragging over the corn a great bough
of a tree. When it was growing, I was forced to fence it;
when ripe to mow it, carry it home, thrash it, part it from
the chaffand save it. And, after all, I wanted a mill to grind
it, sieve to dress it, yeast and salt to make it into bread, and
an oven to bake it. This set my brains to work to find
some expedient for every one of these necessaries against
the next harvest.
And now having more seed, my first care was to prepare
me more land, i pitched upon two large flat pieces of
ground near my castle, for that purpose, in which I sowed
my seed, and fenced it with a good hedge. This took me
up three months: by which time the wet season coining on,
and the rain keeping me within doors, I found several oc-
casions to employ myself; and, while at work, used to di-
vert myself in talking to my parrot, learning him to know
and speak his own name Poll, the first welcome word I ever
heard spoke in the island. I had been a long time con-
triving how to make earthen vessels, which I wanted ex-
fremely and when I considered the beat of the climate, 1 did
not doubt but if 1 could find any such clay, I might botch up a pot, strong enough, when dried in the sun, to bear
handling, and to hold any thing that was dry, as corn, meal,
and other things.
To be short the clay I found; but it would occasion the
most serious person to smile, to see what awkward ways I
took, and what ugly mishapen things I made; how many
either fell out or cracked by the violent heat of the sun, and
fell in pieces when they were removed: so that I think it
was two months before 1'could perfect anything: and
even then but two clumsy things in imitation of earthen jars,
These, however, I very gently placed in wicker baskets,
made on purpose for them, and between the pot and the
baskets, stuffed it full of rice and barley-straw, and these I
presumed would hold my dried corn, and perhaps the meal
when the corn was bruised. As for the smaller things, I
made them with better success; such as little round pots,
flat dishes, pitchers, and pipkins, the sun baking them very
hard.
Yet still I wanted one thing absolutely necefsary, and that
was an earthen pot, not only to hold my liquid, but also to
bear the fire, which none of these could do 1t once hap-
pened, that as I was putting out my fire, I found therein a
broken piece of one of my vessels burnt as hard as rock, and
red as a tile. This made me think of burning some pots;
and having no notion of a kiln, or of glazing them with lead,
1 fixed three large pipkins, and two or three pots in a pile
one upon another. The fire i piled round the outside, and
dry wood on the top, till I saw the pots in the inside red
hot, and found that they were not cracked at all: and when
I perceived them perfectly red, I let one of them stand in
the fire about five or six hours, till the clay melted by the ex-
tremity of the heat, and would have run to glals hud 1 suf-
fered it: upon which I slackened my fire by degrees, till the
rednefs abated; and watching them till the morning, I found
I had three very good pipkins, and two earthen pots, as
well burnt and fit tor my turn as I could desire.
No joy could be greater than mine at this discovery. For
after this, I may say,I wanted for no sort of earthen ware.
1 filled one of my pipkins with water to boil me some meat,
which it did admirably well, and with a piece of kid, I made
me some good broth, as well as my circumstances would
afford me at that time.
The next concern I had, was to get me a stone mortar to
beat some corn in, instead of a mill to grind it. Here, in-
deed, I was at a great loss, as not being fit fora stonecutter; and many days I spent to find out a great stone big enough
to cut hollow and make fit for a mortar, and strong enough
to bear the weight of a pestle, and that would break the corn
without filling it with sand. But all the stones of the island
being of a mouldering nature, rendered my search fruitless; and then I resolved to look out for a great block of hard
wood, which having found, I formed it with my axe and
hammer, and then, with infinite labour, made a hollow in it,
just as the Indians of Brazil make their canoes. When I
had finished this, I made a great pestle of iron wood, and
then laid them up against my succeeding harvest.
My next business was to make a sieve to sift my meal,
and part it from the bran and husk. Having no fine thin
canvafs to search the meal through, I could not tell what to
do. What linen I had was reduced to rags: I had goat's
hair enough, but neither tools to work.it, nor did I know
how to spin it: at length I remembered I had some neck-
cloths of calico or muslin of the sailors, which I had brought
out of the ship, and with these I made three small sieves
proper enough for the work.
I come now to consider the baking part. The want of
an oven I supplied by making some earthen pans very broad
but not deep. When 1 had a mind to bake, I made a great
fire upon the hearth, the tiles of which I had made myself;
and when the wood was burnt into live coals, i spread them
over it, till it became very hot; then sweeping them away,
I set down my loaves, and whelming down the earthen pots
upon them, drew the ashes and coals all around the outsides
of the pot to continue the heat; and in this manner I baked
my barley loaves, as well as if I had been a complete pastry-
-cook, and also made of the rice several cakes and puddings.
It is no wonder that these things took me up the best
part of a year, since what intermediate time I had was be-
stowed in managing my new harvest and husbandry; for in
the proper season I reaped my corn, carried it home, and
laid it up in the ear in my large baskets, tilt 1 had time to
rub, instead of thrashing it. And now, indeed, my corn
increased so much, that it produced me twenty bushels of
barley, and as much rice, that I not only began to use it
freely, but was thinking how to enlarge my barns, and re-
solved to sow as much at a time as would be sufficient for
me for a whole year.
All this while, the prospect of land, which I had seen
from the other side of the island, ran in my mind. I still
meditated a deliverance from this place, though the fear:
of greater misfortunes might have deterred me from it. For,
allowing that I had attained that place, I ran the hazard of being killed and eaten by the devouring cannibals; and if they were not so, yet I might be slain, as other Europeans
had been, who felt into their hands. ^Notwithstanding ail
this, my thoughts ran continually upon that shore. I now wished for my boy Xury, and the long-boat, with the shoul-
der of mutton sail: 1 went to the ship's boat that had been cast a great way on the shore in the late storm. She was
removed but a little; but her bottom being turned up by the impetuosity and fury of the waves and wind, I fell to
work with all the strength I had, with levers and rollers I
had cut from the wood, to turn her, and repair the damages
she had sustained. This work took me up three or four
weeks, when finding my little strength all in vain, I fell to
undermining it by digging away the sand, and so to make it fall down, setting pieces of wood to thrust and guide it
in the fall. But after this was done, I was still unable to
stir it up, or to get under it, much less to move it forward
towards the water, and so I was forced to give it over.
This disappointment, however, did not frighten me. I began to think whether it was not possible for m.e.to make a canoe or perigua, such as the Indians make of the trunk of a tree. But here I lay under particular inconveniences;want of tools to make it, and want of hands to moveit in the water when it was made. However, to work I went.
jipon it, stopping all the inquiries I could make, with this
,very simple answer I made to myself, Let's first make it,
J'll wa-rrant I'll find some way or other to get it along when
.it is done.
1 first cut down •a cedar-tree, which was five feet ten
inches diameter at the lower part next the stump, and four
1'eet eleven inches diameter at the end of twenty-two feet,
after which it lessened for a space, and then parted into
branches. Twenty days was I a hackingand hewing this
tree at the bottom, fourteen more in cutting offthe branches
and limbs, and a whole'month in shaping it like the bottom
of a boat. As for the inside, I was three weeks with a E
mallet and chisel, clearing it in such a manner, as that it was big enough to carry twenty-six men, much bigger than any canoe I ever saw in my life, and consequently sufficient
to transport me and all my effects to that wished-for shore
I so ardently desired.
Nothing remained now, but, indeed, the greatest diffi-
culty to get it into the water, it lying about one hundred
yards from it. To remedy the first inconvenience, which
was a rising hill between the boat and the creek, with won-
derful pains and labour 1 dug into the bowels of the earth,
and made a declivity. But when this was done, all the
strength I had was as insufficient to remove it, as it was when
I attempted to remove the boat. I then proceeded tomeasure
the distance of ground, resolving to make a canal in order
to bring the water to the canoe, since I could not bring the
canoe to the water. But as this seemed to be impracticable
to myself alone, under the space of eleven or twelve years,
it brought me into some sort of consideration; so that I
concluded this also to be impofsible, and the attempt alto-
gether vain. I now saw, and not before, what stupidity it
is to begin work before we reckon its cost, or judge rightly
our own abilities to go through with its performance.
In the height of this work my fourth year "expired, from
the time I was cast on this island. At this time I did not
forget my anniversary; but kept it with rather greater dt£.
voiion than before. For now my hopes being frustrated, I
looked upon this world as a thing I had nothing to do with;
and very well might I say, as father Abraham said unto Dives,
"Between thee and me there is a gulf fixed." And in-
deed I was separated from its wickedness too, having nei-
ther the lust of the flesh, the lustof the eye, nor the pride
of life; I had nothing to covet, being lord, king, and em-
peror over the whole country I had in poftefsion, without
dispute and without control: I had loading of corn, plenty
of turtles, timber in abundance, and grapes above measure.
What was all the rest tome? The money I had lay by me
as despicable dross, which I would freely have given for a
gross of tobacco pipes, or a hand mill to grind my corn: in
a word, the nature and experience of these things dictated
f o me this just reflection: That the good things of this world
are no farther good to us, than they are for our use ; -and
t.hat whatever we may heap up to give to others, we can
but enjoy as much as we use and no more.
These thoughts rendered my mind more easy than usual.
Every time 1 sat down to meat, I did it with thankfulnefs,
admiring the providential hand of God, who, in thiswilder-
nefs, had spread a table to me. And now I considered what
I enjoyed, rather than what I wanted; compared my present
condition with what I at first expected it should be; how
1 should have done, if I had got nothing out of the ship;
that I must have perished before I had caught fish or turtles;
or lived, had I found them, like a mere savage, by eating
them raw, and pulling them to pieces with my claws, like a
beast. I next compared my station to that which I deserv-
ed; howundutiful I had been to my parents: how destitute
of the fear of God: how void of every thing that was good;
and how ungrateful for those abundant mercies I had re-
ceived from Heaven, being fed, as it were, by a miracle,
even as great as Elijah's being fed by ravens; and cast on
a place where there is no venomous creatures to poison or
devour me; in short, making God's tender mercies matter
of great consolation, I relinquished all sadness, and gave
way to contentment.
As long as my ink continued, which with water I made
last as long as I could, I used to minute down the days of the
month, on which any remarkable event happened.—And,
First, I observed, that the same day I forsook my parents
and friends, and ran away to Hull, in order to go to sea; the
same day afterwards in the next year, I was taken and made
a slave by the Salpe rovers.
That the very day I escaped out of the wreck of the ship
in Yarmouth roads, a year after, on the same day, I made
my escape from Salee in my patron's fishing.boat.
And, on the .30th of September, being the day in the year
I was born on, on that day twenty-six years after, was I
miraculously saved, and cast ashore on this island.
The next thing that wasted after my ink, was the bis-
cuit which I had brought out of the ship; and though I al-
lowed myself but one cake a day for above a twelvemonth,
yet I was quite out of bread for near a year, before I got
any corn of my own.
In the next place, my clothes began to decay, and my
linen had been gone long before. However, 1. had pre-
served about three dozen of the sailors' chequered shirts,
which proved a great refreshment to me, when the violent
beams of the sun would not suffer me to bear any of the seaE2
men's heavy watch-coats; which made me turn tailor, and
after a miserable botching manner, convert them to jackets.
To preserve my head, I made me a cap of goat's skin, with
the hair outwards to keep out the rain; which indeed served
me so wel!,that afterwards I made me a waistcoat and opened-
kneed breeches of the same: and then I contrived a
sort of an umbrella,. covering it with skins, which not only
kept out the heat of the sun, but rain also. Thus being easy
and settled in my mind, my chief happiness was to converse
with God, in most heavenly and comfortable ejaculations.
For five years after this I cannot say any extraordinary
thing occurred to me. My chief employment was to cure
my raisins, and plant my barley and rice, both of which I
hud a year's provision beforehand. But though I was dis-
appointed in my first canoe, I made it, at intermediate times, my business to make a second, of much inferior size ; and it
was two years before I had finished it. But as I perceived it would no wise answer my design of sailing to the other
'shore, my thoughts were confined to take a tour round the
island, to see what further discoveries I could make. To
this intent, after having moved her to the water, and tried
how she would sail, I fitted up a little mast to my boat, and
made a sail of the ship's sail that lay by me. I then made
lockers or boxes, at the end of it, to put in necessaries, pro-
vision, and ammunition, which would preserve them drv,
either from rain or the spray of the sea; and in the inside
of the boat, I cut me a long hollow place to lay my gun in,
and to keep it dry, made a flag to hang over it. My um-
breila I fixed in a step in the stern, like a mast, to keep the
heat of the sun off me. And now resolving to see the cir-
cumference of my little kingdom, I victualled my ship for
the voyage, putting in two dozen of my barley-bread loaves,
an earthen pot full of parched rice, a little bottle of rum,
half a goat, powder and shot, and two watch-coats. It was
the 6th of November, in the 6th year of my reign, or capti-
vity, that 1 set out in this voyage; which was much longer
than I expected, being obliged to put farther out, by reason
of the rocks that lay a great way in the sea. And indeed
so much did these rocks surprise me, that I was for putting
back, fearing that if I ventured farther it would be out of
my power to return. In this uncertainty I came to an an-
chor just offshore, to which I waded with my gun on my
shoulder, and then climbing up a hill, which overlooked that point, I saw the full extent of it, ajid so resolved to run
all hazards.
In this prospect from the hill, I perceived a violent cur-
rent running to the east, coming very close to the point;
which I the more carefully observed, thinking it dangerous,
and that when I came to it, I might be drove into the sea
by its force, and not able to return to the island; and cer-
tainly it must have been so, had I not made this observation;
for on the other side was the like current, with this differ-
ence, that it set off at a greater distance; and I perceived
there was a strong eddy under the land; so that my chief
business was to work out of the first current, and conveni-
ently get into the eddy. Two days I staid here, the wind
blowing very briskly E. S. E. which being contrary to the
current, leaves a great breach of the sea upon the point;
so it was neither lit for me to keep too near the shore, on
account of the breach; nor stand at too great a distance, for
fear of the streams. That night the wind abating, it grew
so calm that I ventured out; and here I may be a monu-
ment to all rash and ignorant pilots; for I was no sooner
come to the point, and not above the boat's length from
shore, but I was got into deep water, with a current like
a mill, which drove my boat along so violently, that it was
impossible for me to keep near the edge of it, but forced
me more and more out from the eddy to the left of me; and
all I could do with my paddles were useless, there being no
wind to help me.
Now I began to look upon myself as quite lost, since as
the current ran on both sides of the island, I was very certain they must join again, and then I had no hopes but of
perishing for want in the sea, after what provisions I had
was spent, or before, if a storm should happen to arise.
Who can conceive the present anguish of my mind at
this calamity? With longing eyes did I look upon my little
kingdom, and thought the island the ple.asantest place in
the universe. Happy, thrice happy desert, said I, shall I
never see thee more? Wretched creature! whither atn I
going? Why did I murmur at my lonesome condition, when
now I would give the whole world to bif thither again?
While I was thus complaining, I found myself to be driven
about two leagues into the sea; however, I laboured till my strength was far spent, to keep my boat as far north as
pofsib|y 1 could, to that side of the current where the eddy E 3***
lay on. About noon I perceived a little breeze of wind
spring up from the S. S. E. which overjoyed my heart; and
was still more elated, when in about half an hour, it blew a
fentle fine gale. Had any thick weather sprung up, I had
been lost another way; for having no compafs on board, I
should never have found the way to steer towards the island,
if once it had disappeared; but it proving the contrary, I
set up my mast again, spread my sail, and stood away northward as much as I could, to get rid of the current. And
no sooner did the boat begin to stretch away, but I perceir-
ed, by the clearness of the water, a change of the current
was near; for, where it was strong, the water was foul;
and where it was clear, the current abated. To the east, 1
soon saw about half a mile, a breach of the sea upon some
rocks, which caused it again to separate; and as the main force of it drove away more southerly, leaving the
rocks to the'north-east ; so the other came back by the re-
pulse of the rocks, making a sharp eddy, which returned
back again to the north-west with a very swift stream.
They who have experienced what it is to be reprieved
upon the ladder, or to be saved from thieves, just going to
take away their lives, or such as have been in the like cala-
mities with my own, may guefs my present excefs of joy;
how heartily I ran my boat into the stream of this eddy, and
how joyfulfy 1 spread my sail to the refreshing wind, stand-
ing cheerfully before it, with a smart tide under foot. By
the afsistance of this eddy, I was carried above a league home again, when being in the wake of the island, btJtwixt
the two currents, I found the water to be in a sort of a stand.
About four o'clock in the afternoon, I reached within a
league of the island, and perceived the points of the rock,
which caused this disaster, stretching out, as I observed be-
fore, to the southward, which throwing off the current more
southwardly, had occasioned another eddy to the north. But
having a fair brisk gale, I st retched acrofs this eddy, and in
an hour came within a mile of the shore, where 1 soon
landed to my unspeakable comfort; and after an humble
prostration, thanking God for my deliverance, with a res*'.
lution to lay all thoughts of escaping aside, I brought my
boat safe to a little cove, and laid me down to take a wel-
come repose. When I awoke, I was considering how I
might get my boat home; and coasting along the shore, I
came to^a good bay which ran up to a rivulet or brook,
* . ?*@&&"
where finding a safe harbour, 1 stowed her as safe as if she
had been in a dry dock made on purpose for her.
I now perceived myself not far from the place where be-
fore I had travelled on foot; so taking nothing with me,
except my gun, and umbrella, I began my journey, and in
the evening came to my bower, where I again laid me down
to rest. I had not slept long before I was awakened in
great surprise, by a strange voice that called me several
times, "Robin, Robin, Robinson Crusoe, poor Robin!
"Where are you Robinson Crusoe? Where are you?
"Where have you been f"
So fast was I asleep at first, thai I did not awake thorough-
ly; but half asleep and half awake, I thought I dreamed
that somebody spoke to me. But, as the voice repeated
Robinson. Crusoe several times, being terribly affrighted, I
started up in the utmost confusion; and, no sooner were
my eyes fully open, but I beheld my pretty Poll sitting on
the top of the hedge, and soon knew that it was he that cal-
led me; for just in such bewailing language I used to talk
and teach him; which he so exactly learned, that he would
sit upon my finger, and lay his bill close to my face, and
cry, "Poor Robinson Crusoe, where are you? where have
you been? how came you here r" and such like prattle I
had constantly taught him. But even though I knew it to
be the parrot, it was a great while before I could adjust my-
self; being amazed how the creature got thither, and that
he should fix about that place, and nowhere else. But
now being assured it could be no other than my honest
Poll, my wonder ceased, and reaching out my hand, and
calling familiarly Poll, the creature came to me, and perch-
ed upon my thumb as he was wont, constantly prating to
me with "Poor Robinson Crusoe, and how did I come here,
and where had I been?" as if the bird was overjoyed to
see me; and so I took him home along with me.
I was now pretty well cured of my rambling to sea; yet
I could wish iny boal, which had cost me so much trouble
and pains, on this side the island once more, but which in-
deed was impracticable. I therefore began to lead a very
retired life, 1iving near a twelvemonth in a very contented
manner, wanting for nothing except conversation. As to
mechanic labours, which my necessities obliged me to, I
fancied I could, upon occasion, make a tolerable carpenter,
were the poor tools I had to work withal but good. Be-
sides, as I improved in my earthen ware, 1 contrived to 60 i.IFE AMD ABVENTCSfit
make them with a wheel, which I found much easier and
better, making my work shapely, which before was rude
and ugly. But, I think, I was never so elated with my
own performance or project, than for being able to make a
tobacco-pipe, which, though it proved an awkward clumsy
thing, yet it was very sound, and carried the smoke per-
fectly well, to my great satisfaction.
I also improved my wicker ware, making me abundance of
necessary baskets, which, though not very handsorrie, were
very handy and convenient to fetch things home in, as also
for holding my stores, barley, rice, and other provisions. -
My powder beginning to fail, made me examine after
what manner I should kill the 'goats or birds to live on after
it was all gone. Upon which I contrived many ways to
ensnare the goats, and see if I could catch them alive, parti-
cularly a she-goat with young. At last I had my desire;
for, making pitfalls and traps baited with barley and rice, I
found one morning, in one of them, an old he-goat, and in
the other, three kids, one male, the other two females.
So boisterous was the old one, that I could not bring him
away. But I forgot the old proverb, "That hunger will
"tame a lion:" For had I kept him three or four days with-
out provisions, and then given him some water, with a little
corn, he would have been as tame as a young kid. The
other creatures I bound with strings together; but I had
great difficulty before I could bring them to my habitation.
It was some time before they would feed; but throwing them sweet corn, it so much tempted them, that they began
to be tamer. From thence I concluded, that if I designed
to furnish myself with goat's flesh, when my ammunition was spent, the tamely breeding them up, like a flock of
sheep, about my settlement, was the only method I could
take. I concluded, also, I must separate the wild from the
tame, or else they would always run wild as they grew up;
and the best way for this, was to have some inclosed piece
of ground well tenced, either with a hedge or pale, to keep
them so effectually, that those within might not break out,
or those without break in. Such an undertaking was very
great for one pair of hands; but as there was an absolute
necefsity for doing it, my first care was to find a convenient
piece of ground where there was likely to be herbage for
them to eat, water to drink, and cover to keep them from
the sun.
Here again I gave another instance of my ignorance and
inexperience, pitching upon a piece of meadow land so large,
that had I inclosed it, the hedge or pale had been at least
two miles about. Indeed, had it been ten miles, I had
time enough to do it in; but then I did not consider that my
goats would be as wild in so much compafs, as if they had
had the whole island, and consequently as difficult for me
to catch them. This thought came into my head, after I
had carried it on, I believe, about fifty yards; I therefore
altered my scheme, and resolved to inclose a piece of ground
about one hundred and fifty yards in length, and one hun-
dred in breadth, sufficient enough for as many as would main-
tain me, till such time as my flock increased, and then I could
add more ground. I now vigorously prosecuted my work,
and it took me about three months in hedging the first piece,
in which time I tethered the three kids in the best part of
it, feeding them as near me as possible, to make them fami-
liar: and indeed I very often would carry some ears of bar-
ley or a handful of rice, and feed them out of my hand; by
which they grew so tame, that when my inclosure was
finished, and I had let them loose, they would run after me
for a handful of corn. This indeed answered my end; and
in a year and a half's time, I had a flock of about twelve
goats, kids and all; and in two years after, they amounted
to forty-three, besides what I had taken and killed for my
sustenance. After which I inclosed five several pieces of
ground to feed them in, with pens to drive them into, thai
-1 might take them as I had occasion.
In this project I likewise found additional blessings; for
I not only had plenty of goat's flesh, but milk too, which in
my beginning I did not so much as think of. And, indeed,
though I had never milked a cow, much lefs a goat, or seen
butter or cheese made, yet, after some efsays and miscar-
riages, I made me both, and never afterwards wanted.
How mercifully can the omnipotent Power comfort his
creatures, even in the midst of their greatest calamities?
.How can he sweeten the bitterest Providences, and give us
reason to magnify him in dungeons and prisons! what a
bounteous table was here spread in a wilderness for me,
where I expected nothing at first but to perish for hunger!
Certainly a Stoic would have smiled to see me at dinner.
There sat my royal majesty, an absolute prince and ruler
of my kingdom, attended by my dutiful subjects, whom, if I pleased, I could either hang, draw, quarter, give them
liberty, or take it away. When I dined, I seemed a king,
eating alone, none daring to presume to do so till I had-
done. Poll, as if he had been my principal court favourite,
was the only person permitted to talk with me. My old,
but faithful dog, now grown exceedingly crazy, and who
had no species to multiply his kind upon, continually sat on
my right hand; while my two cats sat on each side of th?
table, expecting a bit from my hand, as a principal mark of
my royal favour. These were not the cats I had brought
from the ship, they had been dead long before, and interred
near my habitation by my own hand. But one of them, as
I suppose, generating with a wild cat, a couple of their
young I had made tame; the rest run wild into the woods,
and in time grew so impudent as to return and plunder me
of my stores, till such time as I shot a great many, and the rest left me without troubling me arty mora. In this plen-
tiful manner did I live, wanting for nothing but conversa-
tion. One thing indeed concerned me, the want of my
boat; I knew not which way to get her round the island.
One time I resolved to go along the shore by land to her;
but had any one in England met such a figure, it would
either have affrighted them, or made them burst into
laughter; nay, I could not but smile to myself at my habit,
which I think in this place will be very proper to describe.
The cap I wore on my head, was great, high, and shape-
lefs, made of a goat's skin, with a flap or penthouse hang-
ing down behind, not only to keep the sun from me, but to
shoot the rain oft' from running into my neck, nothing being more pernicious than the rain falling upon the flesh in these
climates. I had a short jacket pf goat's. skin, whose hair
hung down such a length on each side, that it reached down
to the calves of my legs. As for shoes and stockings, I had
none, but made a semblance of something, I know not what
to call them; they were made like buskins, and laced on
the sides like spatterdashes, barbarously shaped like the rest
of my habit. I had a broad belt of goat's skin dried, girt
found me with a couple of thongs, instead of buckles; on
each pf wl}icn, to supply tjie deficjency of sword and dag-
ger, hung my hatchet and saw. I had another belt, not so
broad, yet fastened in the same manner, which hungover
my shoulder, and at the end of it, under my left arm, hung
two pouches, ffade $f gpaf? skjij to hold my powder M<*
shot. My basket 1 carried on my back, and my gun on my
shoulder; and over my head a great clumsy ugly goat's
skin umbrella, which, however, next to my gun, Was thfe
most necefsary thing about me. As for my face, the colour
was nol so swarthy as the Mulattoes, as might have been
expected from one who took so little care of it, in a climate
within nine or ten degrees of the equinox. At one time
my beard grew so 1ong that it hung down about a quarter
of a yard; but as I had both razors and scifsors in store, I
cut it all off, and suffered none to grow, except a large pair
of Mahometan whiskers, the like of which I had seen wore
by some Turks at Salee, not long enough indeed to hang a
hat upon, but of such a monstrous size, as would have
amazed any in England to have seen.
But all this was of no consequence here, there being none
to observe my behaviour or habit. And so, without fear
and without control, I proceeded on my journey, the prose-
cution of which took me up five Or six days. I first travelled
along the sea shore, directly to the place where I first brought
my boat to an anchor, to get upon the rocks; but now hav-
ing no boat to take care of, I went overland a nearer way
to the same height that I was before upon; when looking
forward to the point of the rock, which lay out, and which
I was forced to double with my boat, I was amazed to see
the sea so.smooth and quiet, there being no rippling motion,
nor current, any more than in other places. This made me
ponder some time to guess the reason of it, when at last I
was convinced that the ebb setting from the west and joining
with the current of water from some great river on shore,
must be the occasion of these rapid streams; and that, con-
sequently, as the winds blew more westwardly or more
southwardly, so the current came the nearer, or went the
farther from the shore. To satisfy my curiosity, 1 waited
there till evening, when the time of ebb being made, I
plainly perceived from the rock the current again as before,
with this difference, that it ran farther off, near half a league
from the shore; whereas, in my expedition, it set close up-
on it, furiously hurrying me and my canoe along with it,
which at another time it would not have done. And now
I was convinced, that, by observing the ebbing and flowing
of the tide, I might easily bring my boat round the island
again. But when I began to think of putting it in practice,
the remembrance of the late danger struck me with such 6
horror, that I changed my resolution, and formed another,
which was more sate, though more laborious; and this was
to make another canoe, and so have one for one side of the
island, and one for the other.
1 had now two plantations in the island; the first my
little fortification, fort, or castle, with many large and spa-
cious improvements; for by this time I had enlarged the cave
behind me with several little caves, one within another,
to hold my baskets, corn, and straw. The piles with which
I made my wall, were grown so lofty and great, as obscured
my habitation. And near this commodious and pleasant
settlement, lay my well-cultivated and improved corn-fields
which kindly yielded me their fruit in the proper season.
My second plantation was that near my country-seat, or
little bower, where my grapes flourished, and where, having
planted many stakes, I made inclosures for my goats, so
strongly fortified by labour and time, that it was much stronger
than a wall, and consequently impossible for them to break
through. As for my bower itself, I kept it constantly in
repair, and cut the trees in such a manner, as made them
grow thick and wild, and form a most delightful shade. In
the centre of this stood my tent, thus erected: I had driven
four piles in the ground, spreading over it a piece of the
ship's sail; beneath which I made a sort of a couch with the
skins of the creatures I had slain, and other things; and
having laid thereon one of the sailor's blankets, which I had
saved from the wreck of the ship, and covering myself with a
great watch-coat, I took up this place for my country retreat.
Very frequently from this settlement did I use to visit
my boat, and keep her in very good order. And sometimes
I would venture in her a cast or two from the shore, but
no farther, lest either a strong current, a sudden stormy
wind, or some unlucky accident should hurry me from the
island as before. But now I entreat your attention, whilst
I proceed to inform you of a new, but most surprising
scene of life which here befel me.
YOU may easily suppose, that after having been here so
^ong, nothing could be more amazing than to see a human
creature. One day it happened, that, going to my boat, I saw the print of a man's naked foot on the shore, very evi-
dt.nt on the sand, as the toes, heel, and every part of it.—Had I seen an apparition of the most frightful shape, I could
not have been more confounded. My willing ears gave the strictest attention. I cast my eyes around, but could
satisfy neither the one nor the other. I proceeded alter-
nately to every part of the shore, but with equal effect;
neither could I see any other mark, though the sand about
it was as susceptible to take impression, as that which was
so plainly stamped. Thus, struck with confusion and hor-
ror, I returned to my habitation, frightened at every bush
'and tree, taking every thing for men; and possessed with
the wildest ideas: that night my eyes never closed. I
formed nothing but the most dismal imaginations, concluding
it must be the mark of the devil's foot which I had seen.
For otherwise how could any mortal come to this island?
where was the ship that transported them r and what signs
of any other footsteps? Though these seemed very strong
reasons for such a supposition, yet (thought I) why should
the devil make the print of his foot to no purpose, as I can
see, when he might have taken other ways to have terrified
me? why should he leave his mark on the other side of the
island, and that too on the sand, where the surging waves
of the ocean might soon have erased the impression. Surely
this action is not consistent with the subtilty of Satan, said
I to myself; but rather must be some dangerous creature,
some wild savage of the main land over against me, that,
venturing too far in the ocean, has been driven here, either
by the violent currents or contrary winds; and not caring to
stay on this desolate island, has gone back to sea again.
Happy, indeed, said I to myself, that none of the savages
had seen me in that place: yet I was not altogether with-
out fear, lest, having found my boat, they should return in
numbers and devour me, or at least carry away all my corn
and destroy my flock ot tame goats. In a word, all my reli-
gious hopes vanished, as though I thought God would not
now protect me by his power, who had so wonderfully pre-
served me so long.
What various chains of Providence are there in the life
of man! How changeable are our affections, according to
different circumstances? We love to day, what we hate
to-morrow; we shun one hour what we seek the next.
This was evident in me in the most conspicuous manner:
for I, who before had so much lamented my condition, in being banished from alljmman kind, was now even ready
to expire, when 1 considered that a man had set his foot on F
this desolate island. But when I considered my station of
life decreed by the infinitely wise and good providence of
God, that I ought not to dispute my Creator's sovereignty,
who has an undoubted right to govern and dispose of his
creatures as he thinks convenient; and that his justice and
mercy could either punish or deliver me: I say, when I
considered all this, I comfortably found it my duty to trust
sincerely in him, pray ardently to him, and humbly resign
myself to his divine will.
One morning lying on my bed, these words of the sacred
writings came into my mind, "Call upon me in the day of
trouble, and I will deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify me."
Upon this sentence, rising more cheerfully from my bed, 1
offered up my prayers in the most heavenly manner: and
when I had done, taking up my bible to read, these words
appeared first in my sight:—" Wait on the Lord, and be
of good cheer, and he shall strengthen thy heart: Wait
I say on the Lord." Such divine comfort did this give me,
as to remove all cause of sadness upon that occasion.
Thus, after a world of apprehensions and fears, for three
days and nights, I at last ventured out of my castle, and
milked my goats, one of which was almost spoiled for want
of it. I next (though in great fear) visited my bower, and
milked my flocks there also; when, growing bolder, I went
down to the shore again, and measuring the print of the foot
to mine, to see, perhaps, whether I myself had not occasion-
ed that mark, I found it much superior in largeness: and so
returned home, now absolutely.convinced that either some
men had been ashore, or that the island must be inhabited,
and therefore that I might be surprised before I was aware.
I now began to think of providing for my security, and
resolved in my mind many different schemes for that pur-
pose. I first proposed to cut down my inclosures, and turn
my tame cattle wild into the woods, that the enemy might
not find them, and frequent the island in hopes of killing
the same. Secondly, I was for digging up my corn fields
for the very same reason. And, lastly, I concluded to de-
molish my bower, lest, seeing a place of human contrivance,
they might come farther, and find out, and attack me in my
little castle.
Such notions did the fear of danger suggest to me: and I
looked, I thought, like the unfortunate king Saul, when not
only opprefsed fay the Philistines, but also forsaken by God
himseTf. And, it is strange, that a little before, having en-
tirely resigned myself to the will of God, I should now have
little confidence in him, fearing those more who could kill
this fading body, than him who could destroy my immortal
soul.
Sleep was an utter stranger to my eyes that night; yet
nature spent and tired, submitted to a silent repose the next
morning, and then joined reason with fear, i considered
that this delightful and pleasant island might not be so en-
tirely forsaken as I might think ; but that the inhabitants
from the other shore might sail, either with a design or from.
necefsity, by cross winds; and, if the latter circumstance,
I had reason to believe they would depart the first oppor-
tunity. However, my fear made me think of a place for re- "treat upon an attack, 1 now repented that I had made my
door to come out beyond my fortification; to remedy whicti
I resolved to make me a second one: I fell to work, there-
fore, and drove betwixt that double rows of trees, which I
planted above twelve years before, several strong piles, thickening it with pieces of timber and old cables, and
strengthening the foot of it with earth which I dug out of my
cave; I also made me seven holes, wherein I planted my
muskets like cannon, fitting them into frames resembling
carriages. This being finished wilh indefatigable industry,
for a great way every where, I planted sticks of osiers like a
wood, about twenty thousand of them, leaving a large space
between them and my wall, that I might have room to see
an enemy, and that they might not be sheltered among the
young trees, if they offered to approach the outer wall.—And, indeed, scarce two years had passed over my head,
when there appeared a lovely shady grove, and in six years
it became a thick wood, perfectly impafsible. For my safe-
ty, I left no avenue to go in or out; instead of which I set
two ladders, one to a part of a rock which was low, and
then broke in, leaving room to place another ladder upon
that; so that when I took these down, it was impossible for
any man to descend without hurting himself; and if they
had, they would still be at the outside of my outer wall.—
But while I took all these measures of human prudence for
my own preservation, I was not altogther unmindful of other
affairs. To preserve my stock of tame goats, that the ene-
my should not take all at once, I looked out for the most F2
retired part of the island, which was the place where I had lost myself before-mentioned, and there finding a clear piece
ofIand, containing three acres, surrounded with thick woods,
I wrought so hard, that in less than a month's time, I fenced
it so well round, that my flocks were very well secured in
it, and put therein two he-goats and ten she-goats.
All this labour was occasioned purely by fearful appre-
hensions, on account of seeingthe print of a man's foot.—
And not contented yet with what I had done, I searched
for another place towards the west point of the island,
where I might also retain another flock. Then wandering
on this errand more to the west of the island than ever 1 had
yet done, and casting my eyes towards the sea, methought
\ perceived a boat at a great distance, but could not polsi-
Lly tell what it was for want of my perspective glass. I
considered then it was no strange thing to see the print of
a man's foot; and concluding them cannibals, blessed God
for being cast on the other side of the island, where none of
the savages, as I thought, ever came. But when I came
down the hill to the shore, which was the S. W. point of
the island, I was soon confirmed in my opinion; nor can
any one describe my horror and amazement, when I saw
the ground spread with skulls, hands, feet, and bones of
human bodies; and, particularly I perceived a space like
a circle, in the midst of which had been a fire, about which
I conjectured these wretches sat, and unnaturally sacrificed
and devoured their fellow-creatures.
The horror and loathsomenefs of this dreadful spectacle,
both confounded my senses, and made me discharge from my
stomach in aii exctfsive manner. I then returned towards
my habitation; and, in my way thither, shedding floods of
tears, und falling down on my bended knees, gave God
thanks for making my nature contrary to these wretches,
and delivering me so long out of their hands.
Though reason and my long residence here had assured me, that these savages never came up to the thick woody
part of the country, and that I had no reason to be appre-
hensive of a discovery; yet such an abhorrence did I still
retain, that, for two years after, J confined myself only to
my fhree plantations; I mean my castle, country-seat, and
inclosure in the woods. And though in proce's of time my
dreadful apprehensions began to wear away, yet my
were more vigilant for fear of being surprised, and I
w
very cautious of firing my gun,lest, being heard by those
creatures, they should proceed to attack me. I resolved,
however, manfully to lose my life if they did, and went
armed with three pistols stuck to my girdle, which, added
to the description I have given of myself before, made me
look with a very formidable appearance.
Thus my circumstances for some time remained very
calm and undisturbed: and when I compared my condition
to others, I found it far from being miserable. And, indeed,
would all persons compare their circumstances, not with
those above them, but with those innumerable unhappy ob-
jects beneath them, I am sure we should not hear fhose
'daily mdrmurings and complainings that are in the world.
For my part, I wanted but few things. Indeed, the terror
which the savages had put me in, spoiled some inventions
for my own conveniences. One of my projects was to brew
me some beer; a very whimsical one indeed, when it is
considered that I had neither casks sufficient, nor could I
make any to preserve it in; neither had I hops to make it
keep, yeast to make it work, nor a copper or kettle to boil it in. Perhaps, indeed, after some years I might bring
this to bear, as I had done other things. But now my inven-
tions were placed another way; and day and night 1 could
think of nothing but how I might destroy some of these
cannibals, when proceeding to their bloody entertainments;
and so saving a victim from being sacrificed, that he might
after become my servant. Many were my contrivances
after this purpose, and as many more objections occurred,
after I had hatched them. I once contrived to dig a hole under the place where they made their fire, and put therein
five or six pounds of gunpowder, which would consequent! v
blow up all those that were near it; and then I was loth to.
spend so much upon them, lest it should not do that certain
execution I could desire, and but only affright and not kili
tfjein. Having laid this design aside, 1 again proposed to
myself to lie privately in ambush, iu some convenient place, with my three guns double loaded, and let fly at them in the midst of their dreadful ceremony : and having killed
two or three of them at every shot, tall upon the rest sud-
denly with my three pistols, and not let one inethtr's si..n
escape... This imagination pleased my fancy so much, th i? t'!TK'• T.o T1"'1 ":.v deaigu.
L 't

in execution, I was not long in seeking for a place conve-
nient for my purpose, where unseen I might behold every
action of the savages. Here I placed my two muskets,
each of which was loaded with a brace of slugs, and four
or five smaller bullets about the size of pistol bullets -T the
fowling-piece was charged with near a handful of the largest
swan shot, and in every pistol was about four bullets.—And thus all things being prepared, no sooner would the
welcome light spread over the element, but, like a giant re-
freshed iuit& ivine, as the Scripture has it, would I ifsue forth
from my castle, and from a lofty hill, three miles distant,
view if I could see any invaders approach unlavrfully to
my kingdom. But having waited in vain two or three
months, it not only grew very tiresome to me, but brought
me to some consideration, and made me examine myself,
what right I had to kill these creatures in this manner.
If (argued I to myself) this unnatural custom of theirs be
a sin offensive to Heaven, it belongs to the Divine Being, who alone has the vindictive power in his hands, to shower
down his vengeance upon them. And, perhaps he does so,
in making them become one another's executioners. Or,
if not, if God thinks these doings just, according to the
knowledge they conceive, what authority have I to pretend to thwart the decrees of Providence, which has permitted
these actions for so many ages, perhaps from almost the beginning of the creation? they never offended me, what right have I then to concern myself in their shedding one
another's blood? and, indeed, I have since known, they value no more to kill and.devour a captive taken in war,
than we do to kill an ox, or eat mutton. I then concluded
it necelsnrily followed, that these people were no more
murderers than Christians, who many times put all troops to the sword, after throwing down their arms.—Again, I considered, that if I fell upon them, I should be as much in
il.e wrong as the Spaniards, who had committed the great-
iLs.t barbarities upon these people who had never offended
them in their whole lives; as if the kingdom of Spain was
eminent for a race of men without common compassion to
the miserable, a principal sign of the most generous temper:
these considerations made me pause, and made me think I
had taken wrong measuresin my resolution: I now argued
with myself, it was better for me never to attack, but to re-
main undiscovered as long as 1 pofsi.bly could; that an op-
posite conduct would certainly prove destructive; for as it
was scarcely to be supposed I could kill them all, I might
either be overpowered by the remaimng, or that some
escaping, might bring thousands to my certain destruction.
And, indeed, religion took their part so much as to convince
me how contrary it was to my duty to be guilty of shedding human blood, innocent as to my particular, whatever they
are to one another; that I had nothing to do with it, but
leave it to the God of all power and dominion, as I said
before, to do therein what seemed convenient to his heavenly
wisdom. And, therefore on my knees I thanked the Al-
mighty for delivering me from blood guiltiness, and begged
his protection that I might never fall into their hands.
Thus giving over an attempt which I had rashly begun, I
never ascended the hill on that occasion afterwards: 1 only
removed my boat, which lay on the other side of the island, and every thing that belonged to her, towards the east,- into
a little cove, that there might not be the least shadow of any
boat near, or habitation upon the island.—My castle then
became my cell, keeping always retired in it, except when
I went out to milk my she-goats, and order my little flock in
the wood, which was quite out of danger: for sure I was
that these savages never came here with expectations to
find any thing, and consequently never wandered from the
coast: however, as they might have been several times on
shore, as well before as after my dreadful apprehensions, I
looked back with horror to think in what stute 1 might have
been, had I suddenly met them slenderly armed, with one
gun only loaded with small shot; and how great would
have been my amazement, if, instead of one man's foot, I
had perceived fifteen or twenty savages, who having once
set their eyes upon me, by the swiftnefs of their feet would
have left me no possibility of escaping? These thoughts
would sink my verv soul, so that I would fall into a deep
melancholy, till such time as the consideration of my grati-
tude to the Divine Being moved it from my heart. 1 then-
fell into a contemplation of the sacred springs of Providence, and how wonderfully we are delivered, when insensible of
it; and when intricated in uncertain mazes or labyrinths of
doubt or hesitation, what secret hints direct us in the right
way, when we intended to go out of it; nay,. perhaps contrary to our business, sense, or inclination. Upon which, I
Cxsd within mu tlus as a certain rule, Never to disobey ihuse.
secret impressions of the mind, to the acting or not acting
any thing that offered, for which I yet could assign no rea-
son. But let it be how it will, the advantage of this con-
duct very eminently appeared in the latter part of my abode
on this island; I am a stranger in determining whence these
secret intimations of Providence derive; yet methinks thev
are not only some proof of the converse of spirits, but also
of the secret communications they are supposed to have
with those that have not passed through the gloomy vale of
death.
These anxieties of mind, and the care of my preservation,
put a period to alt future inventions and contrivances, either
for accommodation or convenience. 1 now cared not to
drive a nail, chop a stick, fire a gun, or make a fire, lest
either the noise should be heard, or the smoke discover me.
And on this account I used to burn my earthen ware privately
in a cave which I found in the wood, and which I made
convenient for that purpose; the principal cause that
brought me here was to make charcoal, so that I might bake
and dress my bread and meat without any danger. At that
time a curious accident happened me, which 1 shall now
relate.
While I was cutting down some wood for making my
charcoal, I perceived a cavity behind a very thick branch
of underwood. Curious to look into it, I attained its mouth,
and perceived it sufficient for me to stand upright in. But
when I had entered, and took a further view, two rolling
shining eyes, liky flaming stars, seemedjo dart themselves
at me; so that I made all the haste out that I could, as not
knowing whether it was a devil or a monster that had' taker*
his residence in that place. When I recovered a little from
my surprise, I called myself a thousand fools, for being
afraid to see the devil one moment, who had now lived
almost twenty years in the most retired solitude. And
therefore resuming all the courage I had, I took a flaming
firebrand, and in I rushed again. I had not proceeded
above three steps, when I was more affrighted than before;
for then I heard a very loud sigh, like that of a human crea-
ture in the greatest agony, succeeded with a broken noise,
resembling words half expressed, and then a broken sigh
again. Stepping back, Lord ! (thought I to myself) where
am I got, into what enchanted place have I plunged my-
self, such as are reported to contain miserable captives; tili
death puts an end to their sorrows? and, indeed, in such
great amazement was I, that it struck me into a cold sweat;
and had my hat been on my head, I believe my hair would
have moved it off. But again encouraging myself with the
hopes of God's protection, I proceeded forward, and by the
light of my firebrand, pcrcieved it to be a monstrous he-goat,
lying on the ground, gasping for life, and dying of mere old
age. At first J stirred him, thinking to drive him out, and
the poor ancient creature strove to get upon his feet, but
was not able; so I e'en let him lie still to affright the sava-
ges, should they venture into this cave. I now looked
round me and found the place but small and shapelefs. At
fhe farther side of it, I perceived a sort of an entrance, yet
so low, it must oblige me to creep upon my hands and
knees to it; so, having no candle, I suspended my enter-
Erise till the next day, and then I came provided with two
irge ones of my own making.
Having crept upon my hands and feet through this strait,
I found the roof higher up, I think about twenty feet. But
surely mortal never saw such a glorious sight before! The
roof and walls of this cave reflected a hundred thousand
lights to me from my two candles, as though they were in-
dented with shining gold, precious stones, or sparkling
diamonds. And, indeed, it was the most delightful cavity or
grotto of its kind, that could be desired, though entirely
dry. The floor was dry and level, and had a kind of
gravel upon it; no nauseous venomous creatures to be seen
there, neither any damp or wet about it. I could find no
fault but in the entrance, and I began to think that even
this might be very necessary for my defence, and therefore
resolved to make it my most principal magazine. I brought
hither two fowling-pieces, and three muskets, leaving only
live pieces at my castle, planted in the nature of cannon.
Of the barrel of gunpowder which I took up out of the sea,
I brought away about sixty pounds of good powder, which
was not damaged; and this, with a great quantity of lead
for bulic-iSj I removed from my castle to this retreat, now
fortified both by art and nature.
I fancied myself now like one of the giants of old, who
were said to live in caves and holes among the rocks, inac-
cefsible to any but themselves; or, at least, a most danger-
ous attempt. And now I despised both the cunning and
strength of the savages, either to find me out or to hurt me.

I.IFB AND ADVENTURES
But I must not forget the old goat, which caused my late
dreadful amazement. The poor creature gave up the
ghost the day after my discovery; and it being difficult to
drag him out, I dug his grave, and honourably entombed
him in the same place where he departed, with as much
ceremony as any Welch goat that has been interred about
the high mountain Penmanmawr.
I think I now was in the twenty-third year of my reign,
and my thoughts much easier than formerly, having contri-
ved several pretty amusements and diversions to pass away
the time in a pleasant manner. By this time my pretty Poll
had learned to speak English, and pronounce his words
very articulately and plain; so that for many hours we used
to chat together after a familiar manner, and he lived with
me no less than twenty-six years. My dog, which was
nineteen years old, sixteen of which he lived with me, died
some time ago of mere old age. As for my cats, they mul-
tiplied so fast, that I was forced to kill or drive them into
the woods, except two or three which became my particular
favourites. Besides these, I continually kept two or three
household kids about me, which I learned to feed out of my
hand, and two more parrots which could talk indifferently,
and rail Rcbimon Crusoe, but not so excellently as the first,
as not taking that pains with them. I had also several sea-
fowls which I had wounded and cut their wings; and
growing tame, they used to breed among the low trees
about my castle wall?, all which made my abode very
agreeable.
But what unforeseen events suddenly destroy the enjoy-
ment of this uncertain state of lift•, when we least expect
them! It was now the month of December, in the southern
solstice, and particular time of my harvest, which required
my attendance in the fields; when going out pretty early
one morning, before it was day-light, there appeared to me
from the sea-shore, a flaming light, about two miles from me
at die east end of th': Island, where I had observed some
savages had been beiore, not on the other side, but to my
great affliction, it was on my side the island.
Struck with a terrible surprise, and my usual apprehen-
sions, that the savages would perceive my improvements, I
returned directly to my castle, pulled the ladder after me,
making all things look as wild and natural as I possibly could. In the next place, I put myself in a posture of defence, loaded my muskets and pistols, and committing
myself to God's protection, I resolved to defend myself till
my last breath. Two hours after, impatient for intelligence,
I set my ladder up to the side of the hill, where there was
a flat place, and then pulling the ladder after me, ascended
to the top, where, laying myself on my belly, with my per-
spective glass, I perceived no less than nine naked savages,
sitting round a small fire, eating, as I supposed, human flesh,
with their two canoes haled on shore, waiting for the flood
to carry them off again. You cannot easily express the
consternation I was in at this sight, especially seeing them
near me; but when I perceived their coming must be
always with the current of the ebb, I became more easy in
my thoughts, being fully convinced that I might go abroad
with security all the time of flood, if they were not before
landed. And, indeed, this proved just as I imagined; for
no sooner did they all take boat and paddle away, but the
tide made N. W. Before they went off, they danced,
making ridiculous postures and gestures, for above an hour,
all stark-naked: but whether men or women, or both, I
could not perceive. When I saw them gone, I took two
guns upon my shoulders, and placing a couple of pistols in
my belt, with my great sword hanging by my side, I went
to the hill, where at first I made a discovery of these can-
nibals and then saw there had been three canoes more of
the savages on shore at that place, which with the rest were
making over to the main land.
But nothing could be more horrid to me, when going to
the place of sacrifice, the blood, the bones, and other mangled
parts of human bodies appeared in my sight; and so fired
was I with indignation, that I was fully resolved to be re-
venged on the first that came there, though I lost my life
in the execution. It then appeared to me, that the visits
which they make to this island are not very frequent, it be-
ing fifteen months before they came again: but still
I was very uneasy, by reason of the dismal apprehensions of their surprising me unawares; nor dared I offer to fire a
gun on that side of the island where they used to appear,
lest, taking the alarm, the savages might return with many
hundred canoes, and then God knows in what manner I
should have made my end. Thus was I a year or more be-
fore I saw any of these devouring cannibals again.
3
But to wave this, the following accident, which demands
attention, for a while eluded the force of my thoughts in
revenging myself on those heathens.
On the 16th of May (according to my wooden calendar)
the wind blew exceedingly hard, accompanied with abun-
dance oflightening and thunder all day, and succeeded by a
very stormy night. The seeming anger of the Heavens
made me have recourse to my bible. Whilst I was seri-
ously pondering upon it, I was suddenly alarmed with the
noise of a gun, which I conjectured was fired upon the
ocean. Such an unusual surprise made me start up in a
minute, when, with my ladder, ascending the mountain as
before, that very moment a flash of fire presaged the report
of another gun, which I presently heard, and found it was
from that part of the sea where the current drove me away.
I could not but then think, that this must be a ship in dis-
trels, and that these were the melancholy signals for a
speedy deliverance. Great, indeed, was my sorrow upon
this occasion; but my labours to assist them must have
proved altogether vain and fruitless. However, I brought
together all the dry wood that was at hand, and making a
pretty large pile, set it on fire on the hill. I was certain
they plainly perceived it, by their firing another gun as soon
as it began to blaze, and after that several more from the
same quarter. All night long I kept up my fire: and
when the air cleared up, I perceived something a great way
at sea directly E. but could not distinguish what it was,
even with my glass, by reason the weather was so very
foggy out at sea. However, keeping my eyes directly fixed
upon it, and perceiving it did not stir, I presently concluded
it must be a ship at anchor, and so very hasty I was to be
satisfied, that taking the gun, I went to the S. E. part of the
island, to the same rocks where I had been formerly drove
away by the current: in which time the weather being
perfectly cleared up, to my great sorrow, I perceived the
wreck of a ship cast away upon those hidden rocks I found
when I was out with my boat; and which, by making a
kind of an eddy, were the occasion of my preservation.
Thus, what is one man's safety is another's ruin; for un
-doubtedly thisMiip had been driven on them in the night,
the wind blowing strong at E. N. E. Had they perceived
the island, as I now guess they had n6t, eertainlft instead
of firing their guns for help, they would rather rave ven•
tured in their boat, and saved themselves that way. I then
thought, that perhaps they had done so, upon seeing mv
.'ire, and were cast away in the attempt; for 1 psrceived
no boat in the ship. But then I again imagined, that, per-
haps they had another vessel in company, which, upon
signal, saved their lives, and took the boat up: or that the
boat might be driven into the main ocean, where these poor
creatures might be in the most miserable condition. But as all these conjectures were very uncertain, I could do no
more than commiserate their distress, and thank God for
delivering me, in particular, when so many perished in the raging ocean.
When I considered seriously every thing concerning this
wreck, and could perceive no room to suppose any of then*.
saved, I cannot explain, by any possible force of words, what
longings my soul felt on this occasion, often breaking out
in this manner: "O that there had been but two or three,
nay, even one person saved, that we might have lived
"together, conversed with, and comforted one another!"
and so much were my desires moved, that when I repeated
these words, "Oh! that there had been but one!" my
hands would clench together, and my fingers prefs the
palms of my hands so close, that, had any soft thing been
between, it would have crushed it involuntarilv, while my
teeth would strike together, and set against each other so
strong, that it required sdme time for me to part them.
Till the last year' of n^y being on this island, I never
knew whether or not any had been saved out of this ship.
I had the affliction, some time after, to see the corpse of a
drowned boy come on shore, at the end of the island which
was next the shipwreck; there was nothing on him but a
seaman's waistcoat, a pair ot opened-kneed linen drawers,
and a blue linen shirt, but no particular mark to guess what
nation he was of. In his pocket were two pieces of eight, and a tobacco-pipe, the lavt ot which I preferred much
more than I did the first Ar.d now the calmness of the
sea tempted me to venture out in my boat to this wreck,
not only to get something necessary out of the ship, but
perhaps" some livirg creature might be on board, whose
life I might preserve. This had such an influence upon
my mind, that immediately I went home, and prepared
every thing necefsary for the voyage, carrying on board * G"
my boat provisions of all sorts, with a good quantity of rum,
fresh water, and a compass: so putting off, I paddled the
canoe along the shore, till I came at last to the north-east
part of the island, from whence I was to launch into the
ocean; but here the currents ran so violently, and appeared
so terrible, that my heart began to fail me; foreseeing that
if I was driven into any of these currents, I might be car-
ried not only out of reach or sight of the island, but even
inevitably lost in the boiling surges of the ocean.
So oppressed was I at these troubles, that I gave over
my enterprise, sailing to a little creek on the shore, where
stepping out, I set me down on a rising hill, very pensiv*
and thoughtful. 1 then perceived that the tide was turned,
and the flood came on, which made it impracticable for me
to go out for so many hours. To be more certain how the
sets of the tides or currents lay when the flood came in, I
ascended a higher piece of ground, which overlooked the
sea both ways; and here I found that as the current of the
ebb set out close by the south point of the island, so the
current of the flood set in close by the shore of the north
side; and all that I had to do, was to keep to the north of
the island in my return.
That night I reposed myself in my canoe, covered with
ciy watch-coat, instead of a blanket, the heavens being my
tester. I set out with the first of the tide lull north, till I
fir It the benefit of the current, which carried me at a great
rate eastward, yet not with such impetuosity as before, as
to take from me all government of my canoe; so that in
two hours time 1 came up to the wreck, which appeared
to me a most melancholy sight. It seemed to be a Spanish
vessel by its building, stuck fast between two rocks; her
stern and quarter beaten to pieces by the sea; her main-
mast and foremast were brought offby the board, that is,
broken off short. As I approached near, I perceived a dog
on board, who, seeing me coming, yelped and cried, and
«o sooner did I call him, but the poor creature jumped into
the sea, out of which I took him up, almost famished with
hunger and thirst; so that when I gave him a cake of bread,
no ravenous wolf could devour it more greedily; and ha
tlrank to that degree of fresh water, that he would have
burst himself, had I suffered him.
The first sight I met with in the ship, were two men
drowned in the cook-room or foreeaitle, inclosed in one another's arms: hence I very probably supposed,thai when
(he vefsel struck in the storm, so high and incessantly did
the waters break in and over her, that the men not being
able to bear it, were strangled by the constant rushing in of
the waves. There were several casks of liquor, whether
wine or brandy I could not be positive, which lay in the
lower hold, as were plainly perceptible by the ebbing out
of the water, yet were too large for me to pretend to med-
dle with; likewise I perceived several chests, which I
supposed to belong to the seamen, two of which I got into
my boat, without examining what was in them. Had the
stern of the ship baen fixod, ttnrl the forepart broken off', I
should have made a very prosperous voyage; since, by
what I after found in these two cheats, 1 "could not other-
wise conclude, but that the ship must have abundance of
wealth on board 5 nay, if I must guess by the course sh«
iteered, she must have been bound from Buenos Ayres, or the Rio de la Plata, in the southern parts of America,
beyond the Brazils, to the Havannah, in the gulf of Mexico,
and so perhapi to Spain. What became of the rest of the
tailors, I could not certainly tell; and all her riches signi-
fied nothing at that time to any body.
Searching farther, I found a cask, containing about
twenty gallons, full of liquor, which, with some labour, I
got into my boat \ in her cabin were several muskets, which
Ilet remain there, but took away with me a great powder-horn, with about four pounds of powder in it. I took also
* fire-shovel and tongs, two brass kettles, a copper pot to
make chocolate, and a gridiron: all which were extremelv
necel'sary to me, especially the fire-shovel and tongs. And
so with this cargo, accompanied with my dog, I came
away, the tide serving for that purpose: and the same
evening, about an hour within night, I attained the island,
after the greatest toil and fatigue imaginable.
That night I reposed my weary limbs in the boat, re-
solving the next morning to harbour what I had gotten in
my new-found subterraneous grotto; and not to carry
my cargo home to my ancent castle. Having refreshed
myself, and got all my effects on shore, I next proceeded
to examine the particulars; and so tapping the cask, I
found the liquor to be a kind of rum, but not like what we
had at the Brazils, nor indeed near so good. At the openG2
ing of the chest, several things appeared verv useful kt me,
for instance, I found in one a very fine case of bottles, con-
taining the finest and best sorts of cordial waters; each
botile he'd about three pints, curiously tipt with silver. I
found also two pots full of the choicest sweetmeats, and
two more which the water had utterly spoiled. There
were likewise several good shirts, exceedingly welcome to
me, and about one dozen and a half of white linen handker-
chiefs and coloured neckcloths, the former of which was
absolutely ntcclsary fi.r wiping my face in a hot day; and,
in the til1, I found three bags of pieces of eight, about eleven
hundred in all, in one of which, decently wrapped up in a
piece of paper, wcre six doubloons of gold, and some small
bars and wedges of the same metal, which I believe might
weigh near a pound. In the other chest, which I guelsed
to belong to the gunner's mate, by the mean circumstance*
which attended :t, 1 found onlv some clothes of very little
A.ilue, except about two pounds of fine glazed powder, in
tl.ree tla.sks,-kept, a, I believe, forchjrghg their fowiing-
| it.ct.3 on any occasion; so that in the whole, I had no
great advantage by this voyage. The money was indeed
a.i ruLre dirt to me, useless and unprofitable, all which I
would have freely parted with for two or three pair ol Eng-
]:sh shoes and stockings; things that for many years I had
not worn, except lately those which I had taken off the feet
of those unfortunate men I found drowned in the wreck,
yet not so go!:d as English shoes, either for ease or service.
I also found in the seaman's chest about fifty pieces of eight
in royals, but no gold; so concluded that what I took
from the fust belonged to an officer, the latter appearing
to have a much inferior person tor its owner. However,
as despicable as the money seemed, I likewise lugged it to
my cave, laying it up securely as I did the rest of my
cargo; and after I had done all this, I returned back to
my boat, rowing and paddling her along till I came to my
i.ld hail:onr, where I carefully laid her up, and so made the
best of my way to my castle. When I arrived there, every
thing seemed safe and quiet: so that now my only business was LO repose. myself after my wonted manner, and take
care of my domestic affairs. But though I might have lived
very easy, as wanting nothing absolutely needful; yet
si ilt I was more vigilant than usual upon account of the sa-
vages, never going much abroad; or, if I did, it was to Ike
east part of the island, where I was well assured that the
savages never came, and where I might not be troubled to
carry that heavy load of weapons for my defence, as I was
obliged to do if I went the other way.
Two years did I live in this anxious condition, in all which
time, contrary to my former resolutions, my head was filled
with nothing but projects and designs, how I might escape
from this island; and so much were my wandering thoughts
bent upon a rambling disposition, that had I had the same
boat that I went from Salee in, I should have ventured
once more to the uncertainty of the raging ocean.
I cannot, however, but consider myself as one of the un-
happy persons, who make themselves wretched by their
dissatisfaction with the station which God has placed them
in; for not to take a review of my primitive condition, and
my father's excellent advice, the going contrary to which
was, as I-may say, my original sin, the following mistakes
of the same nature certainly had been the means of my pre-
sent unhappy station. What business had I to leave a set-
tled fortune and well stocked plantation, improving and
increasing, where, by this time, I might have been worth
a hundred thousand moidores, to turn super-cargo to
Guinea, to fetch Negroes, when time and patience would
so much enlarge my stock at home, as to be able to employ
those whose more immediate business was to fetch them
home even to my door. But as this is commonly the fafe of young heads, so a se-
rious reflection upon the folly of it ordinarily attends the
exercise of future years, when the dear-bought experience
of time teaches us repentance. Thus was it with me; but
notwithstanding the thoughts of my deliverance ran so
strongly in my mind, that it seemed to check all the dictates
of reason and philosophy. And now to usher in my kind
reader, with greater pleasure to the remaining part of my
relation, I flatter myself it will not be taken amiss, to give
him an account of my first conceptions of the manner of
escaping, and upon what foundation I laid my foolish
schemes.
Having retired to my castle, after my late voyage to the
ship, my frigate laid up and secured, as usual, and my con-
dition the same as before, except being richer, though I had
as little occasion for riches as the Indians of Peru had for G 3
gold, before the cruel Spaniards came among them: one night in March, being the rainy season, in the four and
twentieth year of my solitude, I lay down to sleep, very
well in health, without distemper, pain, or uncommon un-
easinefs either of body or mind; yet, notwithstanding, I
could not compose myself to sleep all the night long. All this tedious while, it is impossible to express what innumer-
able thoughts came into my head. I traced quite over the
whole history of my life in miniature, from my utmost re-
ir.embrance of things till I came to this island, and then
proceeded to examine every action and pafsage that had
occurred since I had taken possession of my kingdom. In
my reflections upon the latter, I was comparing the happy
posture of my affairs in the beginning of my reign, to this
life of anxiety, fear, and concern, since I had discovered a
print of a foot in the sand; that while I continued without
apprehension, I^was incapable of feeling the dread and ter-
ror I now suffered. How thankful rather ought I to
have been for the knowledge of my danger, since the
greatest happiness one can be pofsefsed of is to have suffi-
cient time to provide against it f How stupendous is the
goodness of Providence, which sets such narrow bounds to
the sight and knowledge of human nature, that while men
walk in the midst of so many dangers, they are kept serene
and calm, by having the events of things hid from their eyes,
and knowing nothing of those many dangers that surround
them, till perhaps they are dissipated and vanish away.
When I came more particularly to consider of the real
danger I had lor so many years escaped; how I had walked about in the greatest security and tranquillity, at a time,
perhaps, when even nothing but the brow of a hill, a great
tree, or the common approach of night, had interposed be-
tween me and the destructive hands of the cannibals, who
would devour me with as good an appetite, as I would a
pigeon or cinlcw; surely all this, I say, could not but
make me sincerely thankful to my great Preserver, whose
singular protection I acknowledge with the greatest humi-
lity, and without which I must inevitably have fallen into
the cruel hands of those devourers.
Having thus discussed my thoughts in the clearest man-
ner, according to my \\eak understanding•, I next proceeded
to consider the wretched nature of those destroying savages,
r.y seeming. though with great reverence, to mouire, \vhy
Cud should give up any of his creatures to such
even to brutality itself, to devour its own kind? but as this
was rather matter of abstruse speculation, and as my miser-
able situation made me think this of mine the most uncom-
fortable situation in the world, I then began rather to inquire
what part of the world these wretches lived in; how far oft'
the coast was from whence they came; why they ventured
over so far from home; what kind of boats conveyed them
hither; and why I could not order myself and my businufs
so, that I might be as able to attain their country, as they
were to come to my kingdom?
But, then, thought I, how shall I manage myself when I
come thither? what will become of me if I fall into the
hands of the savages? or how shall I escape from them, if
ttiey mike an attempt upon me? and supposing I should not
fall into their power, what shall I do for provisions, or which
way shall I bend my course? These counter-thoughts threw
me into the greatest horror and confusion imagmable; but
then I still looked upon my present condition to be the most
miserable that pofsible could be; and that nothing could be
worse, except death. For (thought I) could I but attain
the shore of the main, I might perhaps meet with some re-
lief, or coast it along, as I did with my boy Xury, on the
African shore, till i came to some inhabited country, where
I might meet with some relief, or fall in with some Christian
ship that might take me in; and if I failed, why then I could
but meet with death, which would putan end to all my mise-
ries. These thoughts, I insist confefs, were.the fruit of a dis-
tempered mind, an impatient temper made desperate, as it
were, by long continuance of the troubles and disappoint-
ments I had met with in the wreck, where I hoped to have
found some living persons to speak to, by whom I might
have known in what place I was, and of the probable means
of my deliverance. Thus, while my thoughts were agitated,
my resignation to the will of Heaven were entirely suspend-
ed, s:t that I had no power to fix my mind to any thing, but
to the project of a voyage to the main land. And, indeed,
so much was [ inflamed upon this account, that it set my
blood into a ferment, and my pulse beat high, as though I
had been in a lever; till nature being, as it were, fatigued
and exhausted with the thoughts of it, made ma sulmit
mj self to a silent repose.
In such a situation, it is very strange, that I did not
dream of what I was so irteiH up-tn ; but, instead of it, my
mind roved on a quite different thii'g, altogether forefgn.
1 dreamed, that as I was issuing from jny castle one morn-
ing, as customary, when 1 perceived upon the shore two
canoes, and eleven savages coming to land, who had brought
with them another Indian, whom they designed to make a
sacrifice of, in order to devour; but just as they were going
to give the fatal blow, methought the poor designed victim
jumped away, and ran directly into my little thick grove
before my fortification, to abscond from his enemies, when
perceiving that the others did not follow him that way, I
appeared to him; that he humbly kneeled down before
me, seemed to pray for my assistance; upon which I
showed him my ladder, made him ascend, carried him to
my cave, and he became my servant; and when I had
gotten this man, I said to myself, now surely I may have
some hopes to attain the main land; for this fellow will
serve me as a pilot, tell me what to do, and where I must
go for provisions, what places to shun, what to venture to,
and what to escape. But when I awaked, and found all
these inexprefsible imprefsions of joy entirely vanished, I
fell into the greatest dejection of spirits imaginable.
Yet this dream brought me to reflect, that one sure way
of escaping was to get a savage; that after I had ventured
my life to deliver him from the bloody jaws of his devourers,
the natural sense he might have of such a preservation,
might inspire him with a lasting gratitude and most sincere
affection. But then this objection reasonably interposed:
how can I effect this, thought I, without I attack a whole
company of them, and kill them all ? why should I proceed
on such a desperate attempt, which my scruples before had
suggested to be unlawful? and indeed my heart trembled
at the thoughts of so much blood, though it were a means
to procure my deliverance. 'Tis true, I might reasonably
enough suppose these men to be real enemies to my life,
men who would devour me, was it in their power; so that
it was self-preservation in the highest degree to free myself,
by attacking them in my own defence, as lawfully as if
they were actually assaulting me: though all these things,
I say, seemed to me to be of the greatest weight, yet, as I
just said before, the dreadful thoughts of shedding human
blood, struck such a terror to my soul, that it was a long
time before I could reconcile myself to it.
But how far will the ardency of desire prompt us on? for notwithstanding the many disputes and perplexities.! hud
with myself, I at length resolved, right or wrong, to get one
of these savages into my hands, cost what it would, or even
though I should lose my life in the attempt. Inspired with
this tirm resolution, I set all my wits at work, to find out
what methods I should take to answer my design: this, indeed, was so difficult a task, that I could not pitch upon any
probable means to execute it: I therefore resolved conti-
nually to be in a vigilant posture, to perceive when the sa-
vages came on shore, and to leave the rest to the event, let
the opportunities otter as they would.
Such was my fixed resolutions; and accordingly I set
myself upon the scout, as often as I could, till such time as I
was heartily tired of it. I waited for above a ye^r and. a
half, the greatest part of which I went out to the west and
south-west corner of the island, almost every day, to look
for canoes, but none appeared. This was a very great dis-
couragement; yet thoiigh 1 was very much concerned, the
edge of my design was as keen as ever, and the longer it
seemed to be delayed, the more eager was I for it; in a
word, I never before was so careful to shun the loathing
sight of these savages, as I was now eager to be with them;
and I thought mysetf sufficiently able to manage one, two,
or three savages, if I had them, so as to make them my en-
tire slaves, to do whatsoever I should direct them, and pre-
vent their being able at any time to do me a mischief. Many
times did I use to please myself with these thoughts, with
long and ardent expectations; but nothing prest.nting, all
my deep projected schemes and numerous fancies vanished
away, as though, while I retained such thoughts, the decrees
of Providence were such that no savages were to come near
me.
About a year and a half after, when I was seriously mus-
ing of sundry other ways how I should attain my end, one
morning early, I was very much surprised by seeing no less than five canoes all on shore together, on my side the island,
and the savages that belonged to them all landed, and out
of my sight. Such a number of them disconcerted all my
measures; for, seeing so many boats, each of which would
contain six, and sometimes more, I could not tell what to
think of it, or how to order my measures, to attack twenty
or thirty men, single-handed; upon which, much dispirited
and perplexed, I lay still in my castle; which, however, I
put in a proper posture for an attack; and'having formerly
provided all that was necefsary, was soon ready to enter upon an engagement, should they attempt. Having waited for some time, my impatient temper would let me bear it no
longer; I set my guns at the foot of my ladder, and, as
usual, ascended up to the top of the hill at two stages, stand-
ing, however, in such a manner, that my head did not ap-
pear above the hill, BO that they could not easily perceive
me; and here, by the assistance of my perspective glass, I
observed no fofo than thirty in number around u fire, feasting
upon what meat they had drafted i how they cooked it, or
what it wai,1 could not then perfectly tell; but they were
all dancing ond cnjiefing about the flamen, uitng many
frightful mid barbarous gestures.
But while, with a curious eve, I was beholding these wretches, my spirit! iitnk within me, when I perceived
them drag two miserable creatures from the boats, to act
nf'resh the dreadful tragedy, as I supposed they had done
"*1>ufore. It was not long before one of them fell upon the
ground, knocked down, as I suppose, with a club or wooden
sword, fur that was their manner j while two or three others went immediately to work, tutting him open for their cook*
cr,y, and then fell to devour him as they had done the for*
^ pier, while the last unhappy captive was left by himself,
'Jill such time as they were ready for him. The poor crea-
ture looked round him with a wishful eye, trembling at the
thoughts of death f yet, seeing himselfa little at liberty, na.
'lure, that very moment, as it were, inspired him with nopea
oflite: he started away from them, and ran, with incre-
dible swiftnefs, along the sands, directly to that part of the
coast where my ancient and venerable castle stood.
You may well imagine, I was dreadfully affrighted upon
this occasion, when, as I thought, they pursued him in a
whole body, all running towards my palace. And now,
indeed, I expected that part of my dream was going to
be fulfilled, and that he would certainly fly to my grove
for protection; but, for the rest of my dream, I could de-
pend nothing on it, that the savages would pursue him
thither, and find him there. However, my spirits begin-
ning to recover, 1 stiil kept upon my guard; and I now
plainly perceived there were but three men out of the num-
ber that pursued him. I was infinitely pleased with what
iwiftnefs the poor creature ran from his pursuers, gained so
much ground upon them, that I plainly perceived could he
thus hold out for'half an hour, there was not the least doubt
but he would save bis life from the power of his enemies.
Of KOIIXSON - R'JitiE. 87
Between them and my castle there was a creek, that
very same which I sailed into with all my effects from the
wreck of the ship, on the steep banks of which I very
much feared the poor victim would be taken, if he could
not swim for his escape: but soon was I out of pain for
him, when I perceived he made nothing of it, though at
full tide, but with an intrepid courage, spurred on by the
sense of danger, he plunged into the flood, swimming over
in about thirty strokes, and then landing, ran with the
same incredible strength and swiftness as before. When
the three pursuers came to the creek, one of them, who I
perceived could not swim, happily for iis part, returned
to his company, while the others, with equal courage, but
much lefs swiftnefs, attained the other side, as though they
were resolved never to give over the pursuit. And now
or never I thought was the time for me to procure me a
servant, companion, or afsistant; and that I was decreed
by Providence to be the instrument to save this poor crea-
ture's life. I immediately descended my two ladders with
the greatest expedition; I took up my two guns, which, I
said before, were at the bottom of them, and getting up
again with the same haste towards the hill, I made nearer
the sea. In a word, taking a short cut down the hill, I
interposed between the pursuers and pursued, hallooing
aloud to the latter, who, venturing to look back, was, no
doubt, as much terrified at me as I at them. I beckoned
to him with my hand, to return back; in the mean time
advancing towards the pursuers, and rushing on the fore-
most, I knocked him down with the stock of my piece,
and laid him flat on the ground. I was very unwilling to
fire, lest the rest should hear, though at a distance, I ques-
tioned whether they could or no; and being out of sight of
the smoke, they could not easily have known what to make
of it. The other savage seeing his fellow fall, stopped as
if he had been amazed; when, advancing towards him, I
could perceive him take his bow from his back, and, fix-
ing an arrow to it, was preparing to shoot at me, and, with-
out dispute, might have lodged the arrow in my breast;
but, in this absolutely necefsary case of self-preservation, I
immediately fired at him, and shot him dead, just as hit
haiid was going to draw the fatal string. All this while,
the savage who had iled before stood still, and had the s»-
tisfaction to see his enemies killed, as he thought, who de-
signed to take away his life; so affrighted was he with the
fire and nrise of my piece, that he stood, as it were, like
Lot's wife, fixed and immoveable, without either sense or
motion. This obliged me to halloo to him again, making
the plainest signs I could to him to draw nearer. I per-
ceived he understood those tokens by his approaching to
me a little way, when, as if afraid I should kill him too,
he stopped again. Several times did he advance, and as
often stop in this manner, till coming more to my view, I
perceived him trembling as if he was to undergo the same
tate. Upon which I looked upon him with a smiling
countenance, and still beckoning to him, at length he
came close to me and k"ecled down, kilsed the ground,
laid his head upon it, and taking me by the foot, set it
upon his head; and this, as I understood afterwards, was
a token of swearing to be my slave for ever. I took him
up, and, making much of him, encouraged him in the best
manner I could. But my work was not yet fimshed;
for I perceived the,savage whom Ihpd knocked down, was
not killed, but stunned with the blow, and began to come
to himself. Upon which I pointed to my new servant,and
showed him that his enemy was not yet expired; he spoke
some words to me, but which I could not understand; yet
being the first sound t.i'a man's voice I had heard for above
twenty-five }ears, tliey were very pleasing to me. But
there was no time for reflection now, the wounded savage
recovering himself so far as to sit upon the ground, which
made my poor pn-./r.tr as much afraid as before; to put
him out of tear, 1 r.ustr.ted try other gun at the man, with

The greatest astonishment that my.new servant conceived
was the manner of killing the savage at such a distance,
without a bow and arrow; and such was his longing desire
to know it, that he first pointed to the dead carcase, and
then made signs to me to grant him leave to go to him.
Upon which I bade him go, and, as well as I could, made
him sensible I granted his request. But when he came
there, how wonderfully was he struck with amazement!
First he turned him on one side, then on another, wonder-
ing he could perceive no quantity of blood, he bleeding
inwardly; and after sufficiently admiring the wound the bullets had made in his breast, he took up his bow and ar-
rows, and came back again: upon which I turned to go
away, making my signs to him to follow, lest the rest, mis-
sing their companions, might come in pursuit of them, and
this I found he understood very well; by his making me
understand that his design was to bury them, that they might
not be seen if it happened; and which by signs again I
made him sensible I very much approved of. Immediately
he fell to work, and never was grave-digger more dextrous
in the world than he was: for in an instant, as I might say,
he scraped a large hole in the sand with his hands, sufficient
to bury the first in; there he dragged him, and without any
ceremony he covered him over; in like manner he served
the other; so that I am sure no undertaker could be more
expert in his busineli j for all this was done in lef* than a
quarter of an hour. I then called him away, and mstead
ot carrying him directly to my castlu at first, 1 conveyed him
to my cave on the farther part of the island; and so my
dream was now fulfilled in that particular, that my grove
should prove an asylum or sanctnry to him.
Weary and iaint, hungry and thirsty, undoubtedly must
this poor creature be, supported chiefly by the vivacity of
spirit, and uncommon transports of joy thai iiis deliverances.
occasioned. Here I gave him bread and a bunch of raisins
to eat, and water to drink, on which he fed Very cheerfully,
to his exceeding refreshment. I then made him a conveni-
ent bed with a parcel of rice straw, and a blanket upon it,
(a bed which I used myself sometimes) and then pointing
to it, made signs lor him to lie down to sleep, upon which the poor creature went to take a welcome repose.
Indeed he was a very comely, handsome young fellow, eK-
tremdy wtH-made, with straight long limbs, not to« tare;.., 'H
but tall and well-shaped, and, as near as I could reckon,
about twenty-six years of age. His countenance had no-
thing in it fierce or surly, but rather a sort of majesty in his
face; and yet, especially when he smiled, he had all the
sweetness and softnels of an European. His hair was not
curled like wool, as many of the blacks are, but long and
black, with the most beautiful yet carelefs trefses spreading
over his shoulders. He had a very high and large forehead,
with a great vivacity and sparkling sharpnefs in his eyes.
His skin was not so tawney as the Virginian Brazilians, or
other Americans; but rather of a bright dun olive colour,
that had something agreeable in it, though not very easy to
give a description of. His face was round and plump, with
a small nose, very different from the flatnefs of the negroes,
a pretty small mouth, thin lips, fine teeth, very well set,
and white as the driven snow. In a word, such handsome
features, and exact symmetry in every part, made me con-
sider, that I had saved the life of an Indian prince, no lefs
graceful and accomplished than the great Oroonoko, whose
memorable behaviour, and unhappy contingencies of life,
have charmed the world, both to admiration of his person,
and compassion to his sufferings.
But let him be either prince or peasant, all my happinefs
centered in this, that I had now got a good servant or com-
panion, to whom, as he deserved, I was resolved to prove a
kind master, and a lasting friend. He had not, I think, slept
above an hour, when he awaked again, and while I was
milking my goats hard by, out he runs from the cave towards
me in my inclosure, and laying himself down on the
ground, in the lowest prostration, made all the antic gestures
imaginable, to express his thankfulness to me for being his
deliverer. I confefs, though the manner of his behaviour
seemed to be ludicrous enough to occasion laughter, yet I
was very much moved at his affection, so that my heart
melted within me, iearing he might die away in excess of
joy, like reprieved malefactors: especially as I was incapable
either to let him blood, or administer physic. It were
to be wished that Christians would take example by this
Heathen, to have a lasting remembrance of the benefits and
deliverances they have received, by the kind mediation
and powerful interposition of their benefactors and deliver-
ers: and it would be likewise happy for mankind, were there no occasion to blame many, who, instead ofthankfu
acknowledging favours and benefits, rather abase and con-
demn those who have been the instrumentsto save them
from destruction.
But leaving these just reflections, I return to the object
that occasioned them; for my man, to conclude the last
ceremony of obedience, laid down his head again on the
ground, close to my foot, and set my other foot upon his head, as he had done before, making all the signs of subjec-
tion, servitude, and submission imaginable, and let me un-
derstand he would serve me as long as his life endured. .As
I understood him in many things, I made him sensible I was
very well pleased with him; and, in a little time, I began
to speak to him, and learn him to talk to me again. In the
first place, I made him understand his name was to be Fri-
day, because it was upon that day I saved his lite; then I
taught him to say Master, which I made him sensible was
to be my name. I likewise taught him to say Yes and No,
and to know what they meant. I gave him sunn: milk man
earthen pot, making him view me while I drank it before
him, and soaked my bread in it; I gave him a cake of bread,
and caused him to soak it likewise, to which he readily con-
sented, making signs of the greatest satisfaction imaginable.
All that night did I keep him there; but no sooner did
the morning light appear, when I ordered him to arise,and
come along with me, with certain tokens that I would give
him some clothes like mine, at which he seemed very giad,
being stark naked, without the least covering whatever.—As we pafscd by the place where the two men had been
interred, my man pointed directly to their gruves, showing
me the marks that he had made to find them again, giving
me to understand, by signs, that we should dig them up,
and devour them. At this I appeared extremely displeased,
exprefsed my utmost abhorrence, as if 1 would vomit at the
apprehension of it, beckoning with my hand to come away,
which he did with the greatest reverence and submilsion.
After this I conducted him to the top of the hill, to view if
the rest of the savages were yet remaining there; but when
I looked through my perspective glals, 1 could see no ap-
pearance of them, nor of their canoes; so that it was very
evident they never minded their deceased companions whom
we had slam; which if they had, they would surely have
searched for, or left one boat behind for them to follow,
after they returned from their pursuit.
Curiosity, rind a desire of satisfaction, animating me with courage to see this scene of barbarity, I took my man Fri-
day with me, putting a sword into his hand, with the bow
and arrows at his back, which I perceived he could use
very dexterously, causing him to carry one gun for me, and
] two for myself; and thus equipped against all attacks,
away we marched directly to the place of their bloody en-
teitainment. Bat when I came there, I was struck with
the utmost horror at so dreadful a spectacle, whilst Friday
was noway concerned about it, being no doubt in his turn
one ofthese devourers. Here lay several human bones, there
several pieces of mangled flesh, half eaten, mangled and
scorched; whilst streams of blood ran promiscuously as
waters from a fountain. As I w.as musing on this dreadful
h:g!it, Friday took all the pains he could, by particular
signs, to make me understand, that they had brought over
four prisoners to/east upon, three of whom they had eaten
up, and that he was the fourth, pointing to himself; that
there having been a bloody battle between them and his great king, in the just defence of whom he was taken pri-
soner, with many others; all of these were carried off to
different places to be devoured by their conquerors; and
that it was his misfortune to be brought thither by these
wretches for the same purpose.
After I was made sensible of these things, I caused Fri-
day to gather those horrid remains, and lay them together
upon a heap, which* ordered to be set on fire, and burn
them to a«hes j My man, however, still retained the nature
of a cannibal, having a hankering stomach alter some of the
flesh; but such an extreme abhorrence did I express at the
least appearance of it, that he durst not but conceal it; for
I made him very sensible, that if he offered any such thing,
I would certainly shoot him.
This being done, I carried my man with me to my castle and gave him a pair of linen drawers, which I had taken
out of the poor gunner's chest beforementioned; and
which, with a little alteration, fitted him very well: in the
next place I made him a jerkin of goat's skin, such at iuy
skill was able to manage, and indeed I thought myself theji
» tolerable good tailor, 1 gave him also a cap which I
made of a hare'* skin, very convenient aud fashionable,,—
Thus being clothed tolerably well, my man was no less proud of his habit, than I was at seeing him in it. Indeed he went very awkwardly at first, the drawers being too heavy
on his thighs, not used to bear any weight, and the sleeves
of the waistcoat galled his shoulders and the inside of his
arms; but by a little easing where he complained they hurt
him, and by using himself to them, at length he took to
them very well.
My next concern was, where I should lodge him; and
that I might do well by him, and yet be perfectly easy my-
selfj ] erected a tent for him in the vacant place between
my two fortifications, in the inside of the last, and the out-
side of the first; and, as there was an entrance or door in-
to my cave, I made a formal framed door-case, and a door
to open on the inside; I barred it up in the night time, tak-
ing in my ladders too, so that, was my man to prove treach-
erous, there could be no way to come at me in the inside
of my innermost wall, without maiting so much noise in
getting over, that it must needs waken me; for my first
wall had now acomplete roof over it ol long poles, spread-
ing over my tent, and leaning up to the side of the moun-
tain, which was again laid across with smaller sticks instead of laths, and thatched over a great thickness with the rice
straw, which was as strong as reeds; and at the hole of the
place, left on purpose to go in and out by the ladder, I placed a kind of trap-door, which, if it had been attempted
on the outside, would not have opened at all, but have
iallen down, and made a great noise; and as to my wea-
pons, every night I took them all to my bedside.
But there was no occasion for this precaution; for surely
never master had a more sincere, faithful, and loving ser-
vant than Friday proved to mo. Without palsion, sullen-
nefs, or design, perfectly obliging and engaging, his affec-
tions were as much tied to me, as those of a child to its
parents; and I might venture to say, he would have sacri?
ficed his life for the saving mine, upon any occasion what-
soever. And, indeed, the many testimomes lie gave me of
this, sufficiently convinced me that I had no occasion to use
these precautions. And here I could not but reflect wi'tj
great \\onder, that,. however it hath pleased tlie Almighty
m his providence, and in the government of the creation,
to take From so great a part of the world of his creatures,
the noblest uses to which their faculties, and the powers of
beir soula are adapted; yet that he hss bestowed upon .
"" n s

them the same reason, affections sentiments of kindness and obligation, passions of resentment, sincerity, fidelity,
and all the capacities of doing and receiving good that he
has given us; and that when he is graciously pleased to
ofler them occasions of exerting these, they are as ready,
nay, more ready, to apply them to the proper uses for
which they were bestowed, than we often are. These
thoughts would make me melancholy, especially when I
considered how mean a use we make of all these, even
though we have these powers enlightened by the Holy
Spirit of God, and by the knowledge of this world, as an
addition to our understanding; and why it has pleased the
heavenly wisdom to conceal the like saving knowledge
Irom so many millions of souls, who would certainly make
a much better use of it than generally mankind do at this
time. These reflections would sometimes lead me so far
as to inveigh the sovereignty of Providence, and, as it were,
arraign the justice of such an arbitrary disposition of things,
that should obscure that light from some, and reveal it to
others, and yet expect a like duty from all. But I closed
it up, checking my thoughts with this conclusion; first,
That we were ignorant of that right and law by which
those should be condemned; but as the Almighty was ne-
cefsarily, and by the nature of his essence, infinitely just
and holy; so it could not be otherwise, but that if these
creatures were all destined to absence from himself, it was
on account of sinning against that light, which, as the
Scripture says, was a law to themselves, and by such a rule
as their consciences would acknowledge to be just, though
the first foundation was not discovered to us. And, se-
condly, Thai still as we were the clay in the hand of the
potter, no yefsel could thus say to him, " Why hast thou
- fashioned me after this manner."
i had not been above two or three days returned to my
castle, but my chief design was, how I should bring Friday
• fl' from this horrid way of feeding; and to take from him
that inhuman relish he by nature had been accustomed to,
I thought it my duty to let him taste other flesh, which
might the rather tempt him to the same abhorrence I so
often expressed against their accursed way of living. Upon
which, one morning I took him out with me, with an in-
tention to kill a kid out of the flock aad bring it home,. aw^
drefs it. As I was going, I perceived a she-goat ly^ng
down in the shade, and two young kids sitting by her.—
Immediately I catched hold of my man Friday, anu Hidiling
him stand still, and not stir, I presented my piece, and shot
one of the kids. My poor servant, who at a distance per-
ceived me kill his adversary, and yet did not know by what
means, or how it was done, stood trembling and surprised,
and looked so amazed, that I thought he would have sunk
into the earth. He did not see the kid I aimed at, or be-
hold I had killed it, but ripped up his waistcoat to see if he
was not wounded, thinking my resoiinion was to kill him;
for coming to me, he fell on his knees, earnestly pronounc-
ing many things which I did not understand the meaning
of; which at length I perceived was, that I would not
take away his life.
Indeed I was much concerned to see him in that con-
dition, where nature is upon the severest trial, when the
immediate hand of death is ready to put for ever a period
to this mortal life , and, indeed, so much compassion had I
to this creature, that it was with difficulty I refrained from tears. But, however, as another sort of countenance was
necessary, and to convince him that I would do him no
harm, I took him smiling by the hand, then laughing at
him, and pointing to the kid which I had slain, made signs
to him to fetch it, which accordingly he did. No less curious was he in viewing how the creature was killed, than
he had been before in beholding the Indian; which, while
he was admiring at, I charged my gun again, and presently
perceived a great fowl, like a hawk, perching upon a tree
within shot: and therefore, to let Friday understand what
I was going to do, I called him to me again, pointing at the
fowl, which I found to be a parrot. I made him under-
stand that I would shoot and kill that bird; accordingly I
fired, and bade him look, when immediately he saw the
parrot fall down. Again he stood like one amazed, not-
withstanding all I had said to him: and the more confound-
ed he was, because he did not perceive me put any thing
into my gun. Undoubtedly a thing so utterly strange,
carrying death along with it, far or near, either to man or
beast, must certainly create the greatest astonishment to one
who never had heard such a thing in his whole life; and
really his amazement continued so long, that had I allowed
it. ke would have prostrated himself before me and my gun,
with the greatest worship and adoration. As for the gun in particular, he would not so much as touch it for several
days afu r, but would come and communicate his thoughts
to it, and talk to it, as if the senseless piece had understood
and answered him; all this I could perceive him do, when
he thought my back was turned, the chief intent of which
was, to desire it not to kill him, as I afterwards came to
und&rstand.
I never strove to prevent his admiration, nor hinder him
from those comical gestures he used on such occasions; but
when his astonishment was a little over, I made tokens to
him to run and fetch the parrot that I had shot; which
accordingly he did, staying sometime longer than usual, by
reason the bird not being quite dead, had fluttered some
way further from the place where he fell. In the mean
time, he was looking for her, I took the advantage of
charging my gun again, so that I might be ready for any
other mark tliat ottered; but nothing more occurred at that
time. So I brought home the kid, and the same evening
took off the skin and divided the carcase as well as I could.
Part of the flesh 1 stewed and boiled in a pot I had for this purpose. And then spreading my table, I sat down, giv-
ing my man some of it to eat, who was wonderfully pleased,
and seemed to like it very well: but what was the most
surprising to him was to see me eat salt with it: upon
which he made me understand, that the salt was very bad
for m«; when putting a little into his mouth he seemed to
nauseate in such a manner, as to spit and splutter at it,
and then washed his mouth with fresh water: but to show
him how contrary his opinion was to mine, I put some
meat into my mouth without salt, and feigned to spit and
splutter as much for the want of it, as he had done at it;
yet all this proved of no signification to Friday; and it was
a long while before he could endure salt in his meat or broth,
and even then but a small quantity.
Thus having fed him sufficiently with boiled meat and
broth at that time, the next day I was resolved to feast him
with a roasted piece of the kid. And having to spit to
fasten it, nor jack to turn it, I made use of that common
artifice which many of the common people of England have,
that is, to set two poles upon each side of the fire, atfi
one across on the top, hanging the meat thereon wjlh Sft.
siting, and so turning round continually, roast it, itvC
same manner as we read bloody tyrants of old cruelly
ed the holy martyrs. This practice caused great admira-
tion in my man Friday, being quite another way than that
to which the savages were accustomed. But when he came
to taste the sweetness and tenderness of the flesh, he e.\-
prefsed his entire satisfaction above a thousand different
ways. And as I could not but understand his meaning, you
may be sure I was as wonderfully pleased, especially when
he made it also very plain to me, that he would never,
while he lived, eat man's flesh more.
It was now high time I should set my servant to work;
so next day I set him to beat out some corn, and sift it in
the same manner as I had done before. And really the fel-
low was very quick and handy in the execution of any thing
I ordered him to go about. I made him understand that it
was to make bread for us to eat, and afterwards let him see
me make it. In short, he did every thing as I ordered him,
and in a little time as well as I could perform it myself.
But now considering that I had two mouths to feed in-
stead of one, it was necessary that I must provide more
ground for my harvest, and plant a larger quantity of corn
than I commonly used to do; upon which I marked out a
larger piece of land, fencing it in, in the same manner as
I had done before; in the execution of which I must give
Friday this good word, that no man could work more hardy,
or with better will thanlie did; and when I made him sen-
sible that it was for bread to serve him as well as me, he
then very passionately made me understand, that he thought
1 had much more labour on his account, than 1 had for my-
self; and that no pains or diligence should be wanting in
him, if I would but direct him in those works wherein he
might proceed.
I must certainly own, that this was the most pleasant year
I ever had in the island; for alter some time, Friday began
to talk pretty well, and understood the names of those things
which I was wont to call for, and the places where I used
to send him. So that my long silent tongue, which had been
uselefs so many years, except in an exclamatory manner,
cither for deliverance or blelsingn, now began to bu occu-
ried in teaching, and talking to my man Friday; for indeed
had such a singular satisfaction in the fellow himself, so
innocent did his simple and unfeigned honesty appear more
and more to me every day, that I really began entirely to
; and for his part, I believe there was no love lost, and that his nature had been more charmed by his exceed-
ing kindness, and his affections more placed upon me, than
any other object whatsoever among his own countrymen.
I once had a great mind to try if he had any hankering in-
clination to his own country again; and by this time having
learned the English so well, that he could give me tolerable
answers to any question which I demanded; I asked him
whether that nation to which he belonged, ever conquered
in battle? the question made Friday to smile, and to which
he answered, "Yes, yes, we alwa)s fight the better;" as
much as to say they always got the better in fight. Upon
which we proceeded on the following discourse: You say,
said I, that you always fight the better; why, then, Friday,
how came you to be taken prisoner?
Friday. But for all that, my nation beat much.
Master, How say you, beat? if jour nation beat them, how came you to be taken prisoner.
Friday. They more many mans than my nation in the
place where me was; they take one, two, three, and me:
my nation much over beat them in the yonder place where
me no was, there my nation mans beat one, two, three great
tousand.
Master. Then why did not your nation recover you from
the hands of jour enemies?
Friday. Thiy run one, two, or three, and me: they make
all go in the canoe; my nation have no canoe that time.
Master, 'Tis very well, Friday; but what does your
nation do with the prisoners they take: Do they carry them
away and eat them, as these have done?
Friday. Yes, yes, my nation eats mans too, eat up all.
Alaster. To what place do they carry them to be devoured?
Ft'iiay. Go to other nations where they think.
Master Do they bring them hither?
Frit/ay. Yes come over hither, come over other place.
Matter. And have you been with them here, Friday?
Friday. Yes, me been here (pointing to tite KOI th--xest of the
island, being the side iu/tae tliey used to tand).
Thus having gotten what account I could from my man,
I plainly understood, that he had been as bad as any of the
rest of the cannibals, having been formerly among the sa-
vages who used to come on shore on the farthest part of the
island, upon the same bloody occasion as he was brought
hither for; and sosie time after I carried him to that'
where he pointed; and no sooner did he come there, but
he presently knew the ground, signifying to me that he was
once there when they ate up twenty men, two women, and
a young child: but as he could not explain the number in
English, he did it by so many stones in a row, making a
sign for me to count them.
This pafsage I had the rather mentioned, because it led
to things more important and useful for me to know; for
after i had the satisfactory discourse with him, my next
question was, how far it was from the island to the shore,
and whetherthe canoes were not often lost in the ocean?
to which he answered there was no danger; that no canoes
were ever lost; but, that after a little way out to the sea,
there was a strong current, and a wind always one way in
the afternoon. This I thought at first to be no more than
the sets of the tide, of going out or coming in; but I after-
wards understood it was occasioned by the great draught
and reflux of the mighty river Oroonoko, in the mouth or
gulf of which I imagined my kingdom lay; and that the
land which I perceived to the W. or N. W. must be the
great island Trinidad, on the north of the river. A thou-
sand questions (if that would satisfy me) did I ask Friday,
about the nature of the country, the sea, the coasts, the in-
habitants, and what nations were nearest them; to which
questions the poor fellow declared all he knew, with the
greatest openness, and utmost sincerity. When I demand-
ed of him the particular names of the various nations of his
sort of people, he could only answer me in general, that
they were called Carribce. Hence it was 1 considered that
these must be the Carribees, so much taken notice of by
our maps, to be on that part of America, which reaches
from the mouth of the river Oroonoko to Guiana, and so
on to St. Martha. Then Friday proceeded to tell me, that
up a great way beyond the moon, as much as to say, be-
yond the setting of the moon, which must be W. from their
country, there dwelt white-bearded men, such as I was,
pointing to my whiskers, and that they kill much mans. I
was not ignorant with what barbarity the Spaniards treated
these creatures; so that 1 presently concluded it must be
them, whose cruelties had spread throughout America, to
be remembered even to succeeding generations.
Well,iyou may be sure, this knowledge, which the im-
perfect .knowledge of my man had led me to, was very comfortable to me, and made me so curious as to ask him
how I might depart from this island, and get amongst those
white men? he told me, "Yes, yes, I might go in two
canoes." In two canoes, thought I, what does my man
mean? surely he means one for himself, and another tor me;
and if not, how must two canoes hold me without being
joined, or one part of my body being put in one, and ano-
ther in another? and indeed it was a long time before I
understood his meaning, which was, that it must be a large
boat as big as two canoes, able to bear with the waves, and
not so liable to be overwhelmed as a small one must be.
I believe there is no state of life but what may be happy,
if people would but endeavour for their part to make it so.
He is not the happiest man that has the most riches; but he
that is content with what he has. Before I had my ser-
vant, I thought myself miserable till I had him; and now that
I had enjoyed the happy benefits of him, I still complained,
and begged a deliverance from a place of retirement, ease,
and plenty, where Providence had sufficiently blefsed me.
In a word, from this time I entertained some hopes, that
one time or other I might find an opportunity to make my escape from this island, and that this poor savage might be
a great furtherance thereto.
All the time since my man became so intelligent as to un-
derstand and speak to me, I spared no pains nor diligence
to instruct him, according to my poor share of knowledge,
in the principals of religion, and the adoration that he ought
to pay to the True God. Onetime, as I very well remem-
ber, I asked him'who made him? At first the innocent
creaturedid not understand what I meant, but rather thought
I asked him who was his father? upon which I took ano-
ther way to make him sensible, by demanding from him an
answerto this question. Friday, said I, who is it that made
the sea, this ground whereon we walk, and all these hills
and woods which we behold? and here, indeed, I did not
miss my intention; for he told me it was Old Benamuckee
(the God whom I suppose these savages adored) who lived
a great way beyond all. But as to his attributes, poor Fri-
day was an utter stranger. He could describe nothing of
this great person; and all that he could say was, that he
was very old, much older than the sea.and land, the moon,
or the stars. Friday, said I again, if this great and old per-
son has made all things in the world, how comes it t*f
3
thai all things, as you in particular, do not adore and wor-
ship him? upon this, looking verv grave, with a perfect
sweet look of innocence, he repled, "Master, all things say
O to him," by which it may be reasonably supposed he
meant adoration. And where, said I, do the people of your
country go when they die? He answered to Benamuckee.
What, and those people that are eaten up, do they go there?
"Benamucki't!," said he, "love 'em dearly; me pray to
"Senamuekce in de canoe, and BenaiKUckce would love me
when dey eat me all up." Such discourses as these had I with my man, and sucli
made me sensible, that the true God is worshipped, though
under imperfect similitudes.; aixi that the fatse adoration
which the Heathens give to their imaginary Deity, is as
great an argument of the divine essence, as the most learned
Athiests (falsely jo called) can bring against it; for God
will be gtorified in his works, let their denomination be what it will; and I cannot be of that opinion which some
conceive, that God should decree men to be damned for
want of a right notion of faith, in a place where the wisdom
of the Almighty has not permitted it to be preached; and
therefore cannot but conclude, that, since obedience is the
best sacrifice, these poor creatures, acting by that light and
knowledge which they are polsefsed of, rnay, undoubtedly,
obtain a happy salvation, though not that enjoyment with
Christ, as his saints, confefsors, and martyrs must enjoy.
But laying these determinations aside, more fit for divines
than me to discut.-:, 1 began to instruct my servant in the
saving knowledge of the true Deity, in which the directions
of God's Holy Spirit assisted me. I lifted up my hands to
Heaven, and pointing thereto, told him, that the great
Maker of Heaven and Earth lived there; that, as his infinite
power fashioned this world out of a confused chaos, and
made it in that beautiful frame which we behold, so he
governs and preserves it by his unbounded knowledge,
sovereign greatness, and peculiar providence; that he was
omnipotent, could do every thing for us, give.ev,ry thmg to
u*, and take every thing away from us; that lie was a re-
warder ana punishtr ofg: od and evil actions; that there was
nothing but what he knew, no thoughts so secret bui. whathe,
couki bring to light: and thus by degrees I opened his c>es,
and desciiljed to hira ihe manner of the creation of the world, the situation of paradise, the transgression of oof
first parents, the wickedness of God's peculiar people, and
the universal sins and abominations of the whole earth. —
When these things were implanted in his mind, I told him,
that as God's justice was equal to his mercy, he resolved to
destroy this world, till his Son Jesus Christ interposed in our
behalf; and, to procure our redemption, obtained leave of
his heavenly Father to come down from Heaven into the
world, where he took human nature upon him, instructed us
in our way to eternal life, and died as a sacrifice for our sins;
that he was now ascended into Heaven, mediating for our
pardon, delivering our petitions and obtaining all those good
benefits which we ask in his name, by humble and hearty
p.rnyers, all which were heard at the throne of Heaven.—As very frequently I used to inculcate things into his mind,Friday one day told me, that if our great God could hear
us beyond the sun, he must surely be a greater God than
their Benamnckee, who lived but a little way off, and yet
could not Ivear them till they ascended the great mountains,
where he dwelt, to speak to him. What, said I, Friday,
did you go thither to speak to him too? he answered,
"No, they never went that were young men, none bat old
men, called their Ocivirkakee," meamng the Indian priests,
*' who went "to sa) O, fso he called saying their prayers)
and they ret. rued back, and told them what Benamuckce
"s^ici." From hence, I.could not but observe how happy
we Christians are, who have God's immediate revelation
for our certain guide; and that our faith is neither misled,
nor our reason imposed upon, by any set of men, such as
these Indian impostors.
But, to clear up this palpable »heat To my man Friday, I
told him, that the pretence of their ancient men going up to
the mountain to say O to their God Benamuckee, was an im-
po'ture, and that their bringing back an answer was all a
sham, it not worse; for that, if there was any suds thing
spoken to them, surely it must proceed from an infernal
spirit. And here I thought it necessary to enter into a long
discourse with him, which I did after this manner.
""Friday, said f, vou must know, that before this world
was made, there was an Almighty power existing, by whose
pow'er nil things were made, and whose Majesty shall have
no end. To be glorified ai.d adored by beings of a heaven-
by nsture, he created angels andarchangels, that is i
spirits resembling himself, to encompafs his throne, eter-
nally singing forth his praise in his most heavenly sounds
and divine harmony. And, among this heavenly choir,
Lucifer bore a great sway, as being then one of the peculiar
favourites of these celestial abodes; but he, contrary to that
duty he owed his heavenly Sovereign, with unbounded
ingratitude to his Divine Creator, not only envied him that
adoration which was his due, but thought to usurp that
throne, which he had neither power to keep, nor title to pre-
tend to. He raised a dissension and civil war in Heaven,
and had a number of angels to take his part. Unbounded
folly! stupendous pride! to hope for victory, and aspire
above his power.ful Creator! the Deity, not fearful of such
an enemy,. vet justly provoked at his rebellion, commissioned his archangel Michael to lead forth the heavenly host,
and give lum battle; the advantage of which was quickly perceived by Satan's being overthrown, and the prince of
the air, Rir so the devil is called, with all his fallen angels,
driven headlong into a dismal pi ice, which is called Hell.
The recital of this truth made my man give the greatest
attention, and he expressed a great satisfaction by his ges-
tures, that God had sent the devil into the deep hole.—
And then I desired him to give great heed to what I had
further to say.
No sooner, proceeded I, was God freed from, and the
Heaven clear of this arch-traitor, but the Father speaks to
the Son and Holy Spirit, who belonged to his essence, and
were equal to him in power and glory, Come let us make man, said he, in out man image, after our on'n likoirfs, Gtn. i. 16,
to have dominion over the creatures of I he work! whicii we
have created. And these he intended should glorify him
in Heaven, according to their obedience in this state of
probation on earth, which was, as it were, to be the school
to train them up for these heavenly mansions. Now, Satan
seeing himself foiled, yet that God had not taken the power
from him as prince of the air, which power Heaven design-
ed he should retain, whereby his creatures might be tried;
in revenge for the disgrace he had received, he tempts
Adam's wile, Eve, to taste of the Uee of knowiedge ofgood
and evil, which God had forbidden. He appears to her in
the shape of a Serpent, then a most beautiful .creature, and
tells her that it was no better than an imposition which God
had put upon her and her husband, not to eat of that fa'u
1 2
104
LIFE AND ADVENTURES
fruit which he had created; that the taste thereof would
make them immortal like God himself; and consequently
as great and powerful as he. Upon which she not only eat
thereof herself, but made her husband eat also, which brought
them both under the heavenly displeasure.
Here Friday expressed a great concern: "Ah,poor mans!"
cried he, "naughty womans! naughty devil! make God not
love de mans, make mans like devil himself."
Friday, said I, God still loved mankind; and though the
devil tempted human nature so far, he would not suffer him
to have an absolute power over them. I have told you be-
fore of his tender love to his people, till they, like Lucifer,
disobeyed his commands and rebelled against him; and
even then, how Jesus Christ, his only Son, came to save
sinners. But still every man that lives in the world is un-
der temptation and trial. The Devil has yet a power, as
prince of the air, to suggest evil cogitations in our minds,
and prompt us on to wicked actions, that he might glory in
our destruction. Whatever evil thoughts we have, proceed
from him; so that God, in this our distress expects we
should apply ourselves to him by fervent prayer for speedy
redress. He is not like Benamuckee, to let none come near
him but Cirwakakee, but suffers the people, as well as priests,
to offer themselves at his feet, thereby to be delivered from
the power and temptation of the devil.
But though at first my man Friday exprefsed some con-
cern atthe wickedness of Lucifer, I found it not so easy to
imprint the right notions of him in his mind, as it was about
the divine essence of God; for there nature assisted me in
all my arguments, to show to him plainly the necefsity ol a
Great First Cause, an over-ruling, governing power; of a
secret directing Providence, anit ot the equity aml reason—
abienels ol pay ing adoration to our Creator; whereas there
appeared nothing of all this in the notion of an evil spirit,
of his first beginning, his nature, and, above all, of his in-
clination to evil actions, and his power to tempt us to the
like. And indeed this ^inlearned Indian, by the mere force
of nature, puzzled me with one particular question, more
than ever I could have expected.
1 hait, it seems, one day, been talking to him of the om-
nipotent power of God, and his infip.ite abhorrence of sin,
insomuch that the Scriptures styled him a consu.fiing fire to
all the workers of iniquity; and that it was in his power, whenever he pleased, to destroy all the world in a moment,
the greater part of which are continually offending him.
When, with a serious attention, he had listened a great
while to what I said, after I had been telling him how the
devil was God's enemy in the hearts of men, and used all
his malice and skill to defeat the good designs of Providence,
and destroy the kingdom of Christ in the world, and so
forth: "Very well, Master," said Friday, "you say God is
"so strong, so great, is he not much strong, much mightier
than the naughty devil?"To be sure, Friday, said I, God
is more wise and stronger than the serpent: he is above the
devil, which makes uspray to him, that he would tread down Satan under his feet, enable us to resist the violent tempta-
tio'ns, and quench his fiery darts. "Why then," answered
Friday quickly, " if God, as you say, has much strong, much
might as the devil, why God no kill devil, make DO more
tempt, no more do wicked."
You may be certain I wasstrangely surprised at the ques-
tion of mv man's: and, though an old man, I was but a
young doctor, and consequently very ill qualified for a ca-
saist, or a resolver of intricate doubts in religion; and as it
required some time for me to study for an answer. 1 pre-
tended not to hear him, nor to ask him what he said; but,
so earnest was he for an answer, as not to forget his question, which he repeated in the very same broken words as above. When I had recovered myself a little ; Friday, said I, God
will at last punish him severely, being reserved for judg-
ment, and is to be cast into the bottomless pit, to remain in
fire everlasting. But all this did not satisfy Friday; for
returning upon me, he repeated my words," KESERVE AT
"LAST, me no understand; but, why not kill devil now,
not k ill devil great, great while ago I" Friday, said I, you
may as well ask me why God does not kill jou and me,
when, by our wicked actions, we so much offend his divine
Majesty? he gives us time to repent of our sins, that there-
by we may obtain pardon. At these words obtain pardon, Friday mused a great while; and, at last, looking me sted-
fastly in the face, " Well, w«ll, "said he,"that's very well;
"so you, I, devil, all wicked mans, all preserve, repent,
God pardon all.
Indeed, here I was run down to the last extremity, when
it became very evident to me, how mere natural notions 1 3
will guide reasonable creatures to the knowledgeof a Deity, and to the homage due to the Supreme Being of God; but
however, nothing but divine revelation can form the know-
ledge of Jesus Christ, and of a redemption purchased for
us, of the mediator of the new covenant, and of an inter-
cessor at the footstool of God's throne; and, therefore, the
Gospel of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ; that is, the
word and spirit of God, promised for the guide and sancti-
fier of his people, are his most necessarv instructors of the
souls of men, in the saving knowledge of the Almighty, and
the means to attain eternal happiness.
And now I found it necessary to put an end to this dis-
course between my man and me: for which purpose I rose
up hastily, and made as if I had some occasion to go out,
sending Friday for something that was a good way off. I
then fell on my knees, and beseeched God that he would
inspire me so far as to guide this poor savage in the know-
ledge of Christ, to answer his questions more clearly, that
his conscience might be convinced, his eyes opened, and
liis soul saved. When he returned again, I entered into a
very long discourse with him, upon the subject of the world's
redemption by the Saviour of it, and the doctrine ofrepent-
nnce preached from Heaven, together with an holy faith
of our blessed Redeemer Jesus Christ; and then I proceed-
ed to explain to him, according to my weak capacity, the
reason why our Saviour took not on him the nature of angels,
but rather the seed of Abraham: and how the fallen angels
had no benefit by that redemption: and, lastly, that h« came
only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel, and the like.—
GoJ knows 1 h•in m.ire sincerity than knowledge in all the
ways I took for the poor Indian's instruction; and I must
acknowledge what I believe every body that acts upon the
same principle will find, that in laying heavenly truths open
before him, I informed and instructed myself in many things
that either I did not know, or had not perfectly considered
.before ; so that, however this poor creature might be im-
proved by my instructions, certain it is, that I myself had
great reason to be thankful to Providence for sending him
to me. His company allayed my grief, and made ray ha-
bitation comfortable; and when I reflected that the sotitary
lite to which I had been so long confined, had made me to look further towards Heaven, by making me the instrument.
Providence, to save the life, am), for pught I know*
the soul of this poor savage, by bringing him to the know-
ledge of Jesus Christ, it caused a secret joy to spread through
every part of my soul; and I frequently rejoiced, that ever
I was brought to this place, which I once thought the most
miserable part of the world.
In this thankful frame of mind did I afterwards continue,
while I abode on the island, and for three years did my
man and I live in the greatest enjoyment of happiness. In-
deed, I believe the savage was as good a Christian as I;
and I hope we were equally penitent; and such penitents
as were comforted and restored by God's Holy Spirit; for
now we had the word of the Lord to instruct us in the right
way, as much as if we had been on the English shore.
By the constant application I made to the Scriptures, as
I read them to my man Friday, I earnestly endeavoured to
make him understand every part of it, as much as lay in my
power. He also, on the other hand, by his very serious
questions and inquiries, made me a much better proficient
in Scripture knowledge, than I should have been by my
own private reading and study. I must not omit another
thing, proceeding from the experience I had in my retire-
ment : It was that infinite and inexpressible blessing, the
knowledge of God through Jesus Christ, which was so plain
and easy to be understood, as immediately to direct me to
carry on the great work of sincere repentance for mv sins,
and laying hold of a Saviour for eternal life, to a practical
stated reformation, and obedience to all God's institutions,
without the assistance of a reverend and orthodox divine;
and especially by this same instruction, so to enlighten this
savage creature, as to make him so good a Christian, as very
lew could exceed him. And there was only this great thing
wanting, that I had no authority to administer the Holy Sa-
crament, that heavenly participation of Christ's body and
blood; yet, however, we rested ourselves content, that God
would accept our desires, and according to our faith, have
mercy on us. But what we wanted one way, was made up in another,
and that was universal peace in our little church. We had
no disputes and wranglings about the nature and equality of
the holy, blessed, and undivided Trinity; no niceties in
doctrine, or schemes of church government; no sour or
morose dissenters to impose more sublimated notions upon
us; no pedant sophisters to confound us with unintelligible mysteries: but instead of all this, we enjoyed the most cer-
tain guide to Heaven; that is, the word of God: besides
which, we had the comfortable views of his Spirit leading
us to the truth, and making us both willing and obedient to
the instruction of his word. As the knowledge and prac-
tice of this are the principal meansof salvation, 1 cannot see
what avails any Christian church, or man in the world,
to amuse himself with speculations and opinions, except it
be to display their particular vanity and affectation.
You may well suppose, that, by the frequent discourse we
had together, my man and I became most intimately ac-
quainted, and that there was but very little that I could say
but what Friday understood; and, indeed, he spoke very
fluently, though it was but broken English. I now took a
particular pleasure in relating all my adventures, especially
those that occurred since my being cast on this island. I
made him understand that wonderful mystery, as he con-
ceived, of gunpowder and bullet, and taught him how to
shoot. I also presented to him a knife, which pleased him exceedingly, making him a belt, with a frog hanging there-
to, like those in which we wear hangers in England; and,
instead of a hanger to put in the frog, I gave him a hatchet,
which was not only as good, but even a better weapon upon
many occasions. In a word, my man thus accoutred, look-
ed upon himself as great as Don Quixote, when that cele-
brated champion went to combat the windmill.
I next gave him a very particular description of the ter-
ritories of Europe, and in a particular manner of Old Eng-
land, the place of my nativity. I laid before him the man-
ner of our worshipping God, our behaviour one to another,
and how we trade in ships to every part of the universe.—
1 then told him my misfortunes in being shipwrecked, show-
ing, as near as I could, the place where the ship lay, which
had been gone long before; and I brought him to the ruins
of my boat, which before my whole strength could not move,
but now was almost rotten, and fallen to pieces. I observed
my man Friday to view this boat with an uncommon cu-
riosity; which, when he had done, he stood pondering a
great while, and said nothing. At last, said I, Friday, what
makes you ponder so much? he replied, "O master, me
see like boat come to place at my nation."
. It was some time, indeed, before I understood what my
man meant; but examining strictly into it, I plainly found, that such another boat resembling mine, had come upon the
country where he dwelt; that is to say, by his fart her explana-
tion, that the boat was driven therethrough stress of weather.
It then came into my mind that some European ship having
been cast away, the poor distressed creatures were forced
to have recourse to the boat to save their lives; and being
all, as I thought, drowned, I never concerned myself to ask
any thing concerning them, but my only inquiry was about
the boat, and what description my man could give of it.
Indeed, Friday answered my demands very well, making
every thing very plain to my understanding; but beyond
measure was I satisfied, when he told me with great warmth
and ardour, "O master, we save white mans from drown;"
upon which J immediately asked him, if there were any
white mans, as he called them, in the boat?" Yes, yes,"
said he, "the boat full, very full of white mans." How
many, Friday .' said I. Hereupon he numbered his fingers,
and counted seventeen. And when I asked him what be-
came of them all, and whether they lived or not? he replied,
"Yrs, master, they all ltve, thev be live among my nation."
This information put fresh thoughts into my head, that these
must be those very men who before I concluded had been
swallowed up in the ocean, after they had left the ship, that
had struck upon the rocks of my kingdom, and after escap-
ing the fury of the deep, landed upon the wild shore, and
committed themselves to the fury of the devouring Indians.
The manner of their cruelties to one another, which con-
sequently, asl thought, must be acted with greater barbarity
to strangers, created in me a great anxiety, and made me
still more curious to ask Friday concermng ihom. He told
me, he was sure they still lived there, having resided among
them above four years, and that the savages gave them vic-
tuals to live upon : But pray, Friday, said I, whence pro-
ceeded all this good-nature and generosity? how came it
to pass that they did not kill and eat them, to please their
devouring appetites, and occasion so splendid an entertain-
ment among \hc.m } " No, no," said Friday, " they not kill
'cm, thi.y m^ke brothers with 'em;" by which I understood
there was a truce between them. And then I had a more
favourable opinion of the Indians, upon Friday uttering
these words: " Aly nation, t'other nation no eat mans, but
when mans make war fight :-" as though he had said, that
neither those of his kingdom, nor any other nations that he
Vnew of, ever ate their fellow-creatures, but such as the'»
1aw of arms allowed to be devoured; that is, those miser-
able captives, whose misfortune it should be to be made pri-
soners of war. Some considerable time after, upon a very pleasant day,
in mast sere.ne weather, my man and I stood upon the top
of a hill, on the east side of the island, whence I had once
before beheld the continent of America. I could not tell
immediately what was the matter; for suddenly Friday fella jumping and dancing as if he had been mad; and upon
my demanding the reason of his behaviour, "O joy," said
he, "O glad! there see my country, there my nation, there
live white snans gether." And indeed such a rapturous
sense of pleasure appeared in his countenance, that his eyes
had an uncommon sparkling and brightness, and such a
strange eagerness, as if he had a longing desire tobe in his
country again. This made me not so well satisfied with
my man Friday as before; for by this appearance, I made
no dispute, but that if he could get back thither again, he
would not only be unmindful of what religion I had taught
him, but likewise of the great obligation he owed me for
his w.onderful deliverance; nay, that he would not only in-
form his countrymen of me, butaccompany hundreds of them
to my kingdom, and make me a miserable sacrifice, like
those unhappy wretches taken in battle.
Indeed I was very much to blame to have those cruel and
unjust suspicions, and must freely own I wronged the poor
creature very much, who was of a quite contrary temper.
And had he had that discerning acuteness which many Eu-
ropeans have, he would certainly have perceived my cold-
ness and indifference, and also have been very much con-
cerned upon that account ,' as 1 was now more circumspect,
I had much lessened my kindness and familiarity with him,
and while this jealousy continued, I used that artful way
(now too much m fashion, the occasion of strife and disseu-
tion) of pumping him daily, thereby to discover whether he
was deceitful in his thoughts and inclinations; but certainly
he had nothing in him but what was consistent with the best
principles, both as a religious Christian and agrateful friend;
and, indeed, I found every thing he said was ingenuous and
innocent, that I had no room for suspicion, and, in spite: «|$}
all uneasiness, he not only made me entirely his
but also caused me much to lament that I ever
one ill thought of him.
As we were walking up the same hill another day, when
the weather was so hazy at sea, that I could not perceive
the continent, Friday, s.aid f, don't you wish yourself to b&
in your own country, your nation, among your old friends
and acquaintances?" Yes," said he, "me much O glad to
"be at my own nation." "And what would you do there,
Friday? would you turn wild again, eat man's flesh, and
be as savage as you were formerly? " No, no," (answered
he, full of concern, and shaking his head) " Friday now tell
"them to live good, tell them pray God, tell them to eat
"corn, bread, cattle, flesh, mitk, no eat man again." But
surely, replied I, if you should offer to do all this, they will kill'
jou; and to manifest their contempt ot such instruction eat
you up when they had done. He then put on a grave,
yet innocent and smooth countenance, saying, "No, they
no kill me, they willing love learn:" that is, that they
would be very willing to learn: adding withal, "that they
had learned much of the bearded mans that came in the
boat." Will you, said I, go back again, Friday? he smiled at that, and told me, that he could not swim so far.
Buf, said f, 1 will make a canoe for you. "Yes, master,"
said he, "me go if you go, me no go if you stay." I go,
Friday! why would you have them to eat me up, and de-
vonr your kind master ?" No, no," said he,"me make
"them not eat master, and me make them much love you;"
that is, he would tell them how I had slain his enemies, and
thereby saved his life, for.wliich reason he would make them
love me: and then he related to me, as well as he was able,
how exceedingly kind those of his nation were to the white,
or bearded, men, as he called them, who, in their great cala-
mity, were driven into their country.
It was from this time, indeed, I had strong inclinations to
venture over, and use my utmost efforts, if possible, to join
these white bearded men, who undoubtedly were Spaniards
or Portuguese; for, thought I, it must certainly be a better
and safer way to escape when there is a good company, than
for me alone, from an island forty miles offthe shore, and
without any assistance. Some days after, Friday and I be-
ing at work, as usual, at the same time diverting ourselves
with various discourses, I told him I had a boat which I
would bestow upon him, whenever he pleased to retuin to
his own nation; and to convince him of the truth of what I
said, I took him with me to the other side of iheislaiid, where'
my frigate lay, and then taking it from under tho water, (for
I always kept it sunk for fear of a discovery) we went both
into it to see how it would manage such an expedition.
And really never could any be more dextrous in rowing
than my faithful servant, making the boat go as fast again as
I could. Well now, Friday, said I, shall we now go to
your so much admired nation? but instead of meeting with
that heerfulness I expected, he looked very dull and me-
lancholy at my saying so; which indeed at first surprised
me, till he made me sensible, that his concern was about
the boat being too small to go so far a voyage. Upon
which I let him understand 1 hid a much bigger; and, ac-
cordingly, the next day went to the place were the first
boat lay, which I had made, when all the strength I had, or
art I could use, failed me in my attempt to get it into the
water: but now it having lain in the sun two and twenty
years, and no care being taken of it all that while, it became
in a manner rotten. My man told me, that such a boat
would do very well for the purpose, sufficient to carry
enough vittle, dtink, bread, for that was his manner of talking.
In short, my mind being strongly fixed upon my designs of
going over with him to the Continent, 1 very plainly told
him that we would both go and make a boat full as big, and
more proportionable than that, wherein he might safely re-
turn to his own nation. These words made Friday look so icry pensive, that I
thought he would have fallen at my feet. It was some time
before he could speak a word, which made me ask him what
was the matter with him? He- replied, in a very soft and
moving tone, "What has poor Friday done? why are you
angry, mad with poor servant? what me done, O what
me done? " Friday, said I, you never yet have offended
me, what makes you think I am angry with you, when I am
not angry at all. "You no angry, no angry," said he, several
times; " it you be no angry, why den send Friday over
great water to my own nation?" Why, surely, Friday, an-
swered I, did not you wish to be there, when from a moun-
tain you beheld the place where you was born? and is it
not to satisfy your desires that I am willing to give you
leave to return thither? "Yes, yes," said Friday, "me wish
." to be there sure enough, but then me wish master there
too : no wish Friday there, no master there." In short, he could not endure the thoughts of going there without i
• f R«!HHSON CRUSOE, 113
•
I go there! Friday, said I, what shall I do there? he an-
swered very quickly, "O master, you do great deal much
good, you teach all de wild mans to be good tame mans:
you learn dem to be sober, life good live, to know God,
"and pray God." Alas! poor Friday, said I, what can I
do against their priests of Benamuckee, or indeed what
good can 1 make your nation sensible of, when I my self ant
but a poor ignorant man ?" No, no, master," said he, "you
be no ignorant, you teachee "me good, you teachee derm
"good." You shall go without me, Friday, said I, for I don't care to accompany you thither; I would rather live
in this solitude than venture among such inhuman savages. Go your way since you desire it, and leave me alone by
myself, as I was, before I saved your life.
Never was any creature more thunderstruck than Friday
was at these words. "Go me away, leave master away,"
said he, after a long silence, " no, no, Friday die, Friday live
not master gone," as though he had said, I neither can nor will live, if my master sends me from him. And here I
cannot but take notice of the strong ties of friendship, which
many times surpass those of consanguinity: For often w»
find a great disagreement among kindred; and when there is any seeming regard for each other, it is very seldom true,
and scarce ever lasting, if powerful interest does not bear
the sway; and that alone is often the occasion of the great-
est hatred in the world, which is to desire the death of
parents and relations, for the sake of acquiring their fortunes.
But there was no such thing between my servant and me;
instead of which there was the greatest gratitude and the most sincere love; he found me not only his deliverer, but
his preserver and comforter; not a severe and cruel tyrant,
but a kind, loving, and affable friend. He wanted for no
manner of sustenance; and when he was ill or out of order,
I was his physician, not only for his body but his soul: and
therefore no wonder was it, that such an innocent creature, long since divested of his former natural cruelty, should have an uncommon concern at so cruel a separation from me,
which pierced him to the very soul, and made him desire
even to die, rather than live without me.
After I had told Friday, in a very careless manner, that
lie should be at his liberty as soon as the boat was made, the language of his eyes expressed all imaginable confusion;
Mrhtn, immediately running xoonu of his hatchets, which he &' K
used to wear as a defensive weapon, he gives it into my hand, with a heart so lull, that he could scarcely speak.—Friday, said I, what is it you mean? what must I do with
this? ''Only kill Friday," said he, "Friday care not live
long." But what must I kill you for? replied I again.
"Ah! dear master, what made you Friday save from eat a
me up, so keep long Friday, make Friday love God, and
love not Benamuckee, and now Friday send away; never
see Friday more." As though the poor creature had said,
Alas! my dearest kind master, how comes it to pass, that
after having ventured your precious life to save me from the
jaws of devouring cannibals, like myself, after such a tender
regard to provide for me such a comfortable nourishment,
and c: ntii.uing so long a kind master, and a most sincere
-fiiend; and after making me forsake the false notion of an
Indian deity, and worship the true God in spirit and in
truth; and after all this, how comes it now, that you are
willing to send me away to my former course of living, by
which means undoubtedly we shall be dead to each other;
but greater must be my misfortune, that I shall never behold
my best friend I have in the world any more. And this un-
doubtedly, though he could not express himself so clearly,
must be his sentiments; for the tears ran down his cheeks
in such a plentiful manner, that I had much ado to refrain from
weeping alsoj when I beheld the poor creature's affection;
so that I was forced to comfort him in the best manner I
could, which I did, by telling him, if he was content to abide
with me, I should be ever willingto keep him.
After Friday's grief was somewhat abated, more fully to
convince me of his affection, he said, "O master, me not
•' care to be in my nation, leave you here; me desire nation
"learn good that's all;" meaning, that his desire was for the
conversion of that barbarous people. But as I had no apos-
tolic mission, nor any concern about their salvation, so I
had not the least intention or desire of undertaking it; and
the strength of my inclination, in order to escape, proceed-
ed chk.tiy i'rom my late discourse with Friday, about these
seventeen white bearded men, that had been driven upon
the Barbarian coast, whom I designed to join as the only
means to further our escape. To which intent my
and I went to search for a proper tree to fell, whereof
imght make a large perigua or canoe, to undertake the
voyage; and, indeed, we were not long in finding one fit tj*
cnr purposei there being enough of wood in the island to
have built a fleet of large vessels; but the thing we princi-
pally wanted, was to get one so near the water, tliat wo
might launch it after it was finished, and not commit so
horrid a mistake as I had done once before.
Well, after a great search for what was best and most
convenient, Friday, at last, whose judgment in such affairs was much superior to mine, pitches upon a kmd oi wood
the most fiting for it. To this day I cannot tell the name
of the tree, nor describe it any other way, than only by say-
ing, that it is very like what we call fustic, or between that and the Niacaragua wood, being much of the same colour
and smell. But though my man exceeded me in my know-
ledge of the most proper tree, yet I showed him a much better and clearer way to make a canoe than ever he knew
before; for he was for burning the hollow or cavity oi tin:
tres, in ord^r t.i make this boat; but I then told him how he
might do it with tools, learning hi:nat the same time how
to use them, which indeed he did very dexterouslv - so that
in a month's tinu we finished it, making it very ha.ii.>'.ma
by cutting the outside in the true shape of a bo it. A ft ^i'
this it took us a full fortnight before we could get her into the water, which we did as it were inch by inch, upon gr-..r.t
rollers; but when she was in, she would have carried twen-
ty men, with all the ease imaginable.
As I was very well pleased, you may be sure, at the launching of this man of war of mine, I was no less amazed
to behold with what dexterity my man would manage her,
turn her, and paddle her along. Well, Friday, said I, what
do you think of it now? Do you think this will carry u.:
over? "Yes, master," said he, "me venture over wolf,
"though great blow wind." But my design wjs jet far-
ther, which he was insensible of; and that was to make a mast and a sail, and to provide her with an anchor and ca-
ble. As to a mast, that was no difficult thing at all to pro-
cure: so I fixed upon a straight young cedar-tree, which I found near the place, great plenty of it abounding in the island; and setting Friday to cut it down, I gave him parti-
cular directions how to shape and order it; but as to the
sail, that I managed myself. I very well knew I had som«
old ones, or pieces of sails enough, which had lain six and
twenty years by me; but not being careful to preserve them,
as thinking I should have no occasion to use them any more, K2
when I came to overlook them, I found them almost all
rotten, except two; and with these I went to work, and
after a great deal of pains and awkward tedious stitching
for want of needles, at length 1 finished a three-cornered
ugly thing, like what we call in England a shoulder of mut-
ton sail, to go with a boom at bottom, and a little small sprit
at the top, like those which our long-boats use, and which
I very well knew how to manage, especially since it was
like that which I had in my patron's fishing-boat, when,
with my boy Xury, I made my escape from the Barbarian
shore.
It was near two^months, I think, before I completed this
work, that is, the rigging and fitting my masts and sails;
and indeed they were nicely done, having made a small stay
and a sail, ora foresail to it, to afsist, if we should turn to
the westward; and, what is still more, I fixed a rudder to
the stern of her, to steer with; and though I was but a very
indifferent shipwright, yet, as I was sensible of the great
nfefulnefs and absolute necessity of a thing like this, I ap-
plied myself to it with such a constant application, that I at
tast accomplished my design; but what with the many dull
contrivances I had about it, and the failure of many things,
it cost me as much pains in ordering as in making the boat.
Besides, when all this was done, I had my man to teach
what belonged to its navigation; for though he very well
understood how to paddle a canoe along, he was an utter
stranger to a sail and a rudder, and was amazed when he
saw me work the boat to and fro in the sea, by them, and
how the sail gibbed and filled this way or that way, as the
course we sailed changed. After some time and a little
use, I made all these things very familiar to him, so that he
became an expert sailor, except in relation to the compass, and that I could make him understand but little of. But as
it happened, there was seldom occasion for it, there being
but little cloudy weather, and scarce any fog in those parts;
the stars were always visible in the night, and the shore
perspicuous by day, except in the rainy season, which con-
fined every one to his habitation. Thus entered in the
seven and twentieth year of my reign, or captivity, which
you please, (the last three of which, blefsed with the com-
pany of my man Friday, ought not to be reckoned) I kept
the anniversary of my landing here, with the same thank.
fulness to God, for his tender mercies, as I did before j and
certainly, as I had great cause for a thankful acknowledg-
ment for my deliverance at first, I had much greater now
for such singular and additional testimonies of the care of
Providence over me, in all my distresses of both body and
mind, and the great hopes I had of being effectually and
speedily delivered; for I had a strong impression upon my
mind, that I should not be another year in this island. But,
however, I still continued on with my husbandry, digging, planting, and fencing, as usual; gathering and curing my
grapes, and doing all other things that were necessary.
And now the rainy season beginning to come on, obliged
me to keep thelonger within doors; but before this, I brought
my new vessel into the creek, where I had landed my rafts
from the ship, and haling her up to the shore, I ordered my
man Friday to dig a dock sufficient to hold her in, and deep enough to give her water, wherein slit; might float; and
when the tide was out, we made a strong dam acrof*
the end of it, to keep out the water; by which means she
lay dry, as to the tide, from the sea; and to keep the rain
from her, we thatched her over, as it were, with boughs of
trees, like a house, so we waited for the months of Novem-
ber and December, in which I designed to venture over the
ocean.
Xo sooner did the seasonable weather begin to draw
near, but so. much was I elevated with this new designed
adventure, "that 1 daily prepared for the voyage. The first
thing I thought on was, to lay by a certain quantity of pro-
.visions, as a sufficient store for such an expedition, intend-
ing in a week or fortnight's time to open the dock, and to
launch out the boat for that purpose. But one morning as I
was very busy upon something necefsary for this occasion,
I called Friday to me, and bid him go to the sea shore, and
see if he could find u turtle or tortoise, a thing which we
commonly had once a week, as much upon account of the eggs, as for the sake of the flesh. He had not been long gone, before he came running back, as though he was pursued
for life, and as it were flciv ovcr my outer wall, or fence,
like one that felt not the ground,or had steps to set his ftct on,
and before I had time to inquire the reasen of his precipi-
tation, he cries out, '' Q dear MasU'r, O sorrow,. sorrow!
"Bad! O bad!" Why what's the matter, Friday, said I. "O yonder, yonder!" said he, " there be one, two, or three.
"seaaoes! two three!'" Surely, thought I, there must ha;

six, by ray man's way of reckoning; but on a stricter
inquiry, 1 found there were but three. Well, Friday, said I,
don't be terrified, I warrant you we will not only defend
ourselves against them, but kill the most of these cruel sa-
vages. But though I comforted him in the best manner I
could, the poor creature trembled so, that I scarce knew
what to do with him : " O master," said he," they comelook
"Friday, cut pieces Friday, cut a me up." Why, Friday,
said I, they will eat me up as well as you, and my danger is
us great as yours. But since it is so, we must resolve to
fight for our lives. What say you? Can you fight, Friday?
"Yes," said he, very faintly, "me shoot, me kill what I
"can, but there come a great many number." That's no
matter, said I again, our guns will terrify those we do not
kill; I am very willing to stand by you to the last drop of
my blood. Now tell me if you will do the like by me, and
obey my orders in whatsoever 1 command? Friday then
answered, "O master me lose life for )ou, me die when
"you bid die." Thus concluding all questions concerning
bis fidelity, immediately 1 fetched him a good dram of rum,
(of• which I had been a very good husband) and gave it him
to comfort his heart. After he had drank it, I ordered him
to take the two fowling-pieces, which we always carried,.
and load them with large swan shot, as big as small pistol
bullets; then I took four muskets, and loaded them with
two slugs; and five small bullets each, charging my two
pistols each with a brace; I hung my great sword, as cus-
tomary, naked to my side, and gave Friday his hatchet, as a
most excellent weapon for defence.
Thus prepared, I thought as well of myself as any knight-
errant that ever handled a sword and spear. 1 took my per-
spective glafs, and went up to the side of the hill, to see
what I could discover; and I perceived very soon, by my
glafs,that there were eneand twentysavages, three prisoners,
and three canoes, and that their chief concern seemed to
be the triumphant banquet upon the three poor human
bodies, a thing which by this time I had observed was very
common with them. I also remarked, that they did not
land at that place from whence Friday made his escape, but
rearer to the creek, where the shore was low, and where a
thick wood came very close to the sea. My soul was then
filled with indignation and abhorrence at such inhuman
wretches, which put a period to all my former thought* 'id
their vindication, neither would 1 give myself timn to con*
«F ROBINSON cnrsea 119
sider their right of.conquest, as I had done before: but de-
scending from the mountain, I came down to Friday, and
told him I was resolved to go speedily to them, and kill
them all; asking him again, in the same breath, if he would
stand by me: when by this time being recovered from his
fright, and his spirits much cheered with the dram I had
given him, he was very pleasant, yet seriously telling me,
as he did before, " When I bid die, "he would die."
And now it was, having fixed my resolution in so strong
si manner, that nothing could divest my breast of its uncom-
mon fury, I immediately divided the loaded arms betwixt
us. To my man Friday I gave a pistol to stick in his gir-
dle, with three guns upon his shoulder, a weight too great,
I confess, to bear; but what must a poor king do, who had
but one soldier in the world? but to show I made him bear
no more than what I would lay on myself, I stuck the other
pistol in my girdle, and the other three guns upon my
shoulders; nay, something more, but that was like ./Esop's
burden, a small bottle of rum, which was soon lightened to
our exceeding refreshment. Thus we marched out, under
a ponderous load of armour, like two invincible champions,
with a quantity of powder and bullets to stand our battle,
and load again when the pieces were discharged. And
now my orders being to be obeyed, I charged Friday to keep close behind me, and not to stir, or shoot, or attempt
any thing till I commanded him; and in the interim, not to
speak so much as one word. It was in this order I fetched
a compass to the right hand, of near a mile, as well to get
over the creek, as to attain the wood; and by this I thought
to come within shot of them before I could be discerned, as
I found, by my glass, would not be difficult to accomplish.
But how fickle and wavering is the mind of men, even in
our greatest fury and strongest inclinations f For while I was taking this march, my resolution began to abate, not
through fear of their numbers, who were a parcel of naked
unarmed wretches, but iihose reflections occured to my
thoughts: what powerwas I commissioned with, or what
occasion or necessity had I to go and imbrue my hands in
human blood, and mmrder people that had neither done nor
intended to do me any wrong? they were innocent in
particular as to me; and their barbarous custom was not
only their misfortune, but a sign that God had left them in
the most immense stupidity; but yet did not warrant me to be a judge of their actions, much less an executioner of hi*
righteous judgments: That on the contrary, whenever he
thought fit, he would take vengeance on them himself, and
punish them in a national way, according to their national
crimes; but this was nothing at all to me, who had no con-
cern with them. Indeed my man Friday might justify him-
self, because they were his declared enemies, of that very
same nation that went to sacrifice him before; and, indeed,
it was lawful for him to attack them, which I could not say
was so with respect to me. So warmly did these things press
upon my thoughts all the wav I went, that I only resolved
to place myself so as to behold their bloody entertainment
without falling upon them, except something more than or-
dinary, by God's special direction, should oblige me. thereto.
Thus fixed in my resolution, I entered into the thick wood,
(my man Friday following me close behind) when with all
possible wariness and silence, [ marched till I came to the
skirt of it, on that side which was the nearest to them; for
only one end of the wood interposed between me and them.
Upon which I called very softly to Friday, and showing him
a great tree, that was just at the corner of the wood, I or-
dered him to repair thither, and bring me word if lie could
plainly perceive their actions; accordingly he did as I com-
manded him, and came back with this melancholy story,
that they were all about their fire, eating the flesh of one of
their prisoners; and that another lay bound upon the sand,
at a little distance from them, which they designed for the
next sacrifice, and this he told me was not one of their na?
tion, but one of those very bearded men, who were driven
by a storm into their country, and of whom he had so often
talked to me about. You may be sure, that upon hearing this,
my soul was ready to sink within me: when, ascending into
a tree, I saw plainly, by my glass, a white man, who lay upon
, tne beach of the sea, with his hands and feet tied with flags,
or things resembling rushes, being covered with clothes,
and seemed to be an European. From the tree where 1 took
this prospect, 1 perceived another tree and a thicket be)Ond
it, about fifty yards nearer to them than where I was, which,
by taking a small.circle round, I might come at undiscovered,
and then I should be within half a shot of these devourers.
And this consideration alone, to be more perfectly revenged
upon them, made me withhold my passion, though I w.as
enraged. to .the highest degr«s imaginable; when goinj
back about twenty paces, I got behind some bushes, which
held all the way till I came to the other tree; and then I
ascended to a little rising ground, not above eighteen yards
distance, and there I had a full view of these creatures, and
I could perceive all their actions.
Such a sight did then appear as obliged me not to lose
a moment's time. No less then nineteen of these dreadful
wretches sat upon the ground, close huddled together, ex-
pressing all the delight imaginable at so barbarous an en-
tertainment; and they had just sent the other two to murder
this poor unhappy Christian, and bring him limb by limb
to their fire; for they were then just going to untie the
bands from his feet, in order for death, as fetters are knock-
ed off the feet of malefic.tors before they go to the place of
execution. Hereupon, immediately turning to my man,
now, Friday, said I, mind what I say, fail in nothing, but
do exactly as you see me do. All which he promising he
would perform, I set down one of my muskets and fowling-piece upon the ground, and Friday did the same by his; and
with the other musket 1 took my aim at the savages, bidding
him do the like: are you ready? said I: " Yes, Master,"
said he; why then fire at them, said I; and that very mo-
ment I gave fire likewise.
I only killed one and wounded two; but my man Friday,
taking his aim much better than I, killed two and wounded
three. You may be sure they were in a dreadful consterna-
tion at such an unexpected disaster, and those who had yet
escaped our penetrating shot, immediately jumped upon
their feet, but were in such a confusion, that they knew not
which way to run or look, not knowing from whence their
destruction came. We threw down our pieces and took up
others, giving a second dreadful volley ; but as they were
loaded only with swan shot, or small pistol bullets, we per-
ceived only two of them fall; though many were wounded,
who tun yelling and screaming about like mad creatures.
Now, Friday, said I, lay down your piece, and take up the
musket, and follow me. He did so, with great courage;
when, showing ourselves to the savages, we gave a great
shout, and made directly to the poor victim, who would
have been sacrificed had not our first fire obliged the butch-
ers, with three others, to jump into a canoe. By my order
Friday fired at them, at which shot I thought he had killed
them all, by reason of their falling to the bottom of the boat;
however, he killed two, and mortally wounded a third. 1»
the mean time, I cut the flags that tied the hands and feet
of tlie poor creature, and lifting him up, asked him in the
Portuguese tongue, What kewas? He'answeredme in Latin,
Christianas: but so very weak and faint, that lie could scarce
stand or speak. Immediately i gave him a dram, and a
piece of bread to cherish him, and askedhim what country-
man he was? He said, Hispaniola, and then uttered all the
thanktulr.ef& imaginable for his deliverance. Signior, said I,
with as much Spanish as I was master of, let us talk after-
wards, but fight now; here take th's sword and pistol, and
do what you can. And, indeed, hn did so with such cou-
rage and intrepidity, that he cut two of them in pieces in
an instant, tite savages not having the power to fly lor their
lives. I ordered Friday to run for ilvt'e pieces we had Itli
at ihe tree, which he brought me with great swiftnefs, and
then I gave him my musket, while 1 loaded the rest. Bat
now thiTe happened a riert;e encounter between the Spani-
ard aud one of the savages who had made at him with one
of their woodsn swords; and though the former was as
hrave as could be expected, having twice wounded his ene-
my in the head, yet beiog weak airi faint, the Indian had
thrown him upon the ground, and was wresting my sword
out ofliis hand, which the Spaniard very wisely quitting,
drew out his pistol, and shot him through the body before I
could come near him, though 1 was running to his afsistance.
As to Friday, he pursued the (lying wretches with his hatch-
et, despatching three, but the rest were too nimble for him.
The Spaniard taking one qf the fowling-pieces, wounded
two, who running into the wood, Friday pursued and killed;
but the other, notwithstanding his wounds, plunged/himself
into the sea, and swam to those who were left in the cauoe,
which, with one wounded, were all that escaped out of on«
and twenty. The account is as follows:

TJie savages in the canoe worked very hard to get out
efour reach, and Friday was as eager in pursuing them;
and indeed I was no less anxious about their escape, lesi,
aiter the news had been carried to their people, they should
return in multitudes, and destroy us. So being resolved to
pursue them, I jumped into one of their canoes, and bid
Friday follow me; but no sooner was I in, than, to my sur-
prise, I found another poor creature bound hand and foot
for the slaughter, just as the Spaniard had been, with very
little life in him. Immediately I unbound him, and would
have helped him up, but he could neither stand nor speak,
but groaned so piteously, as thinking he was only unbound
in order to be slain. Hereupon I bid Friday speak to him,
and tell him of his deliverance; when pulling out my
bottle, I made the poor wretch drink a dram, which, with
the joyful news he had received, so revived his heart, that
he sat up in the boat. As soon as Friday began to hear him
speak, and look more fully in his face, it would have moved
any one to tears to perceive his uncommon transports of
joy; for he kissed, embraced him, hugged him, cried,
laughed, hallooed, jumped about, danced, sung, then cried
again, wrung his hands, beat his face and head, then sung
and jumped about again, like a distracted creature; so that
it was a great while before 1 could make him speak to me
or tell me what was the matter with him; but when he
came to the liberty of his speech, at last he told me it was
his father.
Here indeed I was infinitely moved to see that dutiful
and tender affection this poor savage had to his aged parent.
He would sit down by him in the boat, open his breast, and
hold his father's head close to his bosom, half an hour toge-
ther, to cherish him: then he took his arms and ancles,
which were stiff and numbed, with binding, and chafed and
rubbed them with his hands; by which means perceiving
what the case was, I gave him tome rum, which proved of
great benefit to him.
While we were busy in this. action. the savages had got-
ten almost out of sight; and happy it was we did not pur-
sue them : For there arose from the north-west which con-
tfnued all night 1.mg, such a violent storm, that 1 could not
suppose otherwise but that they were all drowned. After
this I called Friday to me, and asked him if he had given
h'u father anv bread ?- He shoke his head and said,"
"not one bit, me eat a-up all;" so [ gave him a cake of
bread out of a little pouch I carried for this end. I like-
wise gave him a dram for himself, and two or three bunches
of raisins for his father. Both these he carried to him, for
he would make him drink the dram to comfort him.
Away then he runs out of the boat as if he was bewitched,
with such an extraordinary swiftness, that he was out of
sight as it were in an instant; but at his return, I perceived
him slacken his pace, because he had somthing in his hand.
And this I found to be, as he approached nearer, an earthen
jug with some water for his father, with two more cakes of
bread, which he delivered into my hands. Being very
thirsty myself, I drunk some of the water, of which when
his father had drank sufficiently, it more revived his spirits
than all the rum I had given him.
I then called Friday to me, and ordered him to carry the
Spaniard one of the cakes, and some water, who was
reposing himself upon a green place, under the shade of a
tree, but so weak,that though he exerted himself, he could
not stand upon his feet. Upon which I ordered Friday to
rub and bathe his ancles with rum, as he did his father's.—But every minute he was employed in this he would cast a
wishful eye towards the boat, where he left his father sit-
ting; who suddenly disappearing, he flew like lightning
to him, and finding he had only laid himself down to ease
his limbs, he returned back to me presently, and then I
spoke to the Spaniard to let Friday help him, and lead him
to the boat, in order to be conveyed to my dwelling, where
I would take care of him. Upon which Friday took him
upon his back, and so carried him to the canoe, setting him
close by his father; and presently stepping out again,
launched the boat off, and paddled it along the shore faster
than I could walk, though the wind blew very hard too,
and having brought them safe to the creek, away he runs to
fetch the other canoe, which he brought to the creek almost
as soon as I got to it by land, when wafting me over, we took our new guests out of the boat; but so weak were they
that I was forced to make a kind of a hand-barrow; and
when I came to my castle, not being willing to make an
entrance into my wall, we made them a handsome tent,
covered with old sails, and boughs oftrees, making two
good beds of rice straw, with blankets to lie upon and cover
them. Thus, like an absolute king over subjects who owed
6
their lives to me, I thought myself very considerable, espe-
cially as I had now three religions in my kingdom, my man
Friday being a Protestant, his father a Pagan, and the Spa-
niard a Papist: but I gave liberty of conscience to them all.
To get provisions for.my poor weak subjects, I ordered
Friday to kill me a yearling goat; which when he had done,
I cut off the hinder quarters, and chopping it into small
pieces, boiled and stewed it, putting barley and rice into
the broth. This I carried into their tent, set a table, dined
with them myself, and enconragcd them. Friday was my
interpreter to his father, and indeed to the Spaniard too,
who spoke the language of the savages pretty well. After
dinner, I ordered Friday to fetch home all our arms from the
field of battle, and the next day to bury the dead bodies,
which he did accordingly.
And now I made Friday inquire of his father, whether
he thought these savages had escaped the late storm in their
canoe? and if so, whether they would not return with a
power too great for us to resist? he answered, that he
thought it impossible they could outlive the storm; or, if
they were driven southwardly, they would come to a land
where they would be as certainly devoured, as iithey were
drowned in the sea. And suppose they had attained their
own country, the strangeness of their fatal and bloody attack, would make them tell their people, that the rest of
them were killed by thunder and lightning, not by the
hand of man, but by two heavenly spirits, (meaning Friday
and me) who were sent from above to destroy them. And
this, he said, he knew, because he heard them say the same
to one another. And indeed he was in the right on't; for
I have heard since, that these four men gave out that who-
ever went to that enchanted island, would be destroyed by
fire from the gods.
No canoes appearing soon after, as I expected, my ap-
prehensions ceased: Instead of which my former thoughts
of a voyage took place, especially when Friday's father as-
sured me, I should have good usage in his nation. As to
the Spaniard, he told me that sixteen more of his country-
men and Portuguese, who had been shipwrecked, made their escape thither; that though they were in union with
the savages, yet they were very miserable for want of pro-
visions and Bother. necel*aries. Whea I asked him about L
the particulars of his voyage, he answered that their ship
was bound from Rio de la Plata to the Havannah; that
when the ship was lost, only five men perished in the ocean;
the rest, having saved themselves in the boat, were now
landed on the main continent. And what do they intend
to do there? said I. He replied, they have concerted mea-
tures to escape, by building a vessel, but that they had nei-
ther tools nor provisions, so that all their designs came to
nothing. Supposing, said I, I should make a proposal, and
invite them here, would they not carry me prisoner to New
Spain? he answered no; for he knew them to be such ho-
nest men, as would scorn to act such inhuman baseness to
their deliverer: that, if I pleased, he and the old savage
would go over to them, talk with them about it, and bring
me an answer: that they should all swear fidelity to me
as their leader, upon the Holy Sacrament; and, for his part,
he would not only do the same, but stand to the last drop
of his blood, should there be occasion.
These solemn afsurances made me resolve to grant them
relief, and to send these two over for that purpose; but
when everything was ready, the Spaniard raised an objec-
tion, which carried a great deal of weight in it: "You
." know, sir," said he, "that having been some time witb
"you, I cannot but be sensible of your stock of rice and
*' corn, sufficient, perhaps, for us at present, but not for them,
should they come over presently; much less to victual a
"vefsel for an intended voyage. Want might be as great
an occasion for them to disagree and rebel, as the children
of Israel did against God himself, when they wanted
bread in the wildernefs. And, therefore, my advice is,
to wait another harvest, and in the mean time cultivate
and improve soine more land, whereby we may have
plenty of provisions, in order to execute our design."
This advice of the Spaniard's I approved extremely, and
so satisfied was I of his fidelity, that I esteemed him ever
after. And thus we all four went to work upon some more
land, and against seed-time we had gotten so much cured
and trimmed up, as was sufficient to sow twenty-two bushels
of barley on, and sixteen jars of rice, which was, in short,
all the seed we had to spare. As we were four in number,
and by this time all in good health, we feared not a hun-
dred Indians, should they venture to attack us; and while
the corn was growing, I pitched upon some trees, fit t«
127
build us a large vessel, in case the Spaniards came over;
which being marked, I ordered Friday and his father to cut
them down, appointing the Spaniard, who was now my
privy counsellor, to oversee and direct the whole. I like-
wise increased my flocks of goats, by shooting the wild
dams, and bringing home their kids to my inclosure. Nor
did I neglect the grape season, but cured them as usual,
though I had such a quantity now, as would have filled
eighty barrels with raisins. And thus all of us being employed, they in working, and I in providing for them, till
harvest came, God Almighty blessed the increase of it so
much, that from twenty-two barrels of barley, we thrashed
out two hundred and twenty, and the like quantity of rice,
sufficient to victual a ship tit to carry me and all the Spaniards to any part of America.
Thus the principal objection being answered, by a suffi-
cient stock of provisions, I sent my two ambassadors over
to the main land, with a regal authority to administer the
oaths of allegiance and fidelity, and have an instrument
signed under their hands, though I never asked whether
they had pen, ink, or paper; when gWing each of them a musket, eight charges of powder and ball, and provisions
enough for eight days, they sailed away with a fair gale,
on a day when the moon was at full.
Scarce a fortnight had passed over my head, but impa-
tient for their return, I laid me down to sleep one morning,
when a strange accident happened, which was ushered in.
by Friday's coming running to me, and calling aloud,
"Master, master, they are come, they are come." Upon
which, not dreaming of any danger, out I jumped from my
bed, put on my clothes, and hurried through my little grove;
when looking towards the sea, I perceived a boat about a
league and a half distant, standing in for the shore with the
wind fair. I beheld they did not come from the side where
the land lay on, but from the southernmost end of the island:
So these being none of the people we wanted, I ordered
Friday to lie still, till such time as I came down from the
mountain, which with my ladder, I now ascended, in order
to discover more futly what they were; and now with the
help of my perspective glass, I plainly perceived an Eng-
lish ship, which I concluded it to be, by the fashion of its
long boat; and which fHied me with such uncommon trans-
it .-'
ports of joy, fhat I cannot tell how to describe; and yet
some secret doubts hung about me, proceeding from I know
not what cause, as though T had reason to be upon my
guard. And, indeed, I would have no man contemn the
secret hints and intimations of danger, which very often are
given, when we may imagine there is no possibility of its
being real; for had I not been warned by this silent admo-
nition, I had been in a worse situation than before, and
perhaps inevitably ruined.
Not long it was, before I perceived the boat to approach
the shore, as though they looked for a place where they
might conveniently land; and at last they ran their boat on
shore upon the beach, about half a mile's distance; which proved so much the happier for me; since, had they come
into the creek, they had landed just at my door, and might
not only have forced me out of my castle, but plundered
me of all I had in the world. Now I was fully con-
vinced they were all Englishmen, three of which were un-
armed an.d bound; when immediately the first four or fiva
leaped on shore, and took those three out of the boat as
prisoners; one of whom I could perceive used the most
passionate gestures of entreaty, affliction, and despair, while
the others, in a lesser degree, showed abundance of concern.
Not knowing the meaning of this, I was very much as*
stonished, and I beckoned to Friday, who was below, to
ascend the mountain, and likewise to view this sight. "O
"master," said he to me, "you see English mans eat pri-
"soners as well as Savage mans." And do you think they
will eat them, Friday? said I, "Yes," said Friday, " ihey
"eat-a all up." No, no, said I, Friday, I am much more
concerned lest they murder them, but as for eating them
up, that I am sure they will never do.
And now I not only lamented my misfortune in not hav.t
ing the Spaniard and the savage with me, but also that I
could not come within shot of them unperceived, (they hav-
ing no fire arms among them) and save these three men,
whom I thought they were going to kill with their swords.
But some comfort it was to me, that I perceived they were
set at liberty to go where they pleased, the rascally seamen
scattering about as though they had a mind to see the place;
and so long did they negligently ramble, that the tide had
ebbed ^o low as to leave the boat aground. Nor where the
two men who were in her more circumspect; for having
drunk a little too much liquor, they fell fast asleep; but one
of them waking before the other, and perceiving the boat
too fast aground for his strength to move it, he hallooed out
to the rest, who made all pofsible expedition to come to
him; but as Providence ordered it, all their force was in-
effectual to launch her, when I could hear them speak to
one another, "Why let her alone, Jack, can't ye; she'll
float next tide;" by which words I was fully convinced they
were my own countrymen. I all this while lay very quiet,
as being fully sensible it could be no less than ten hours be-
fore the boat could be afloat, and then it would be so dark,
that they could not easily perceiveme, by which means'I
should be at more liberty to hear their talk, and observe all
their motions; not but that I prepared for my defence: yet,
as I had another sort of an enemy to combat with, I acted
with more caution. I took two fusees on my shoulder, and
gave Friday three muskets; besides my formidable goat-
skin coat and monstrous cap made me look as fierce and
terrible as Hercules of old, especially when two pistols were
stuck in my belt, and my naked sword hanging by my side.
It was my design at first not to make any attempt till it
was dark; and it being now two o'clock, in the very heat
of the day, the sailors were all straggling in the woods, and
undoubtedly were lain down to sleep. The three poor dis-
trefsed creatures, too anxious to get any repose, were how-
ever seated under the shade of a great tree, about a quarter
of a mile from me. Upon which, without any more ado, I
approached towards them, with my man following behind
me, and, before I was perceived, I called aloud to them in Spanish, "What are ye, Gentlemen r"
At these words, they started up in great confusion, when
they beheld the strange figure I made; they returned no
answer-, but seemed as if they would fly from me. "Gen-
**men," said I, in English, "don't be afraid; perhaps you
have a friend nearer than you expect." "He must be
from Heaven," said one of them, gravely, pulling off his
hat, "for we are past all help in this world." "All help
'"is from Heaven," said I; "but, Sir, as I have perceived
every action between you and these brutes since your
landing, only inform me how to afstsi you,.and I will do
it to the utmost of my power."

"Am I talking with God or man," said he, in melting
tears. "Are you of human kiud or auangel?" "Sir/"
*aid I, "my poor habit will tell you I am a man, and an
"Englishman, willing to assist you, having but this servant
"only: here are arms and amunition; tell freelv your

"is too long to relate, since our butchers arc so near; but
"Sir, I was master of that ship, my men have mutinied,
"and it is a favour they have put my mate, this patsenger,
"and me, on shore without murdering us, though we ex-
"pect nothing but perishing here." "Are your enemies
"gone ?" said I, "No," replied he, pointing to a thicket,
"there they lie, while my heart trembles, lest having seen
and heard us, they should murder us all." "Have they
*' fire arms?" said I. "They have but two pieces," said
he, "one of which is left in the boat." He also told me
there were two enormous villains among them, that were
the authors of this mutiny, who, if they were killed or
seized, might induce the rest to return to their obedience.—
"Well, well," said I, "let us retire farther under the
*' covering of the woods;" and there it was I made these
conditions wilh him.
I. That, while they staid in the island, they should not
pretend to any authority; but should entirely conform to
my orders, and return me the arms which I should put in
iheir hands.
II. That, if the ship was recovered, they should afford
Friday and myself a passage gratis to England.
When he had given me all the satisfaction I could desire,
I gave him and his two companions each of them a gun,
with powder and ball sufficient, advising them to fire upon
them as they lay sleeping. The Captain modestly said, that
he was sorry to kill them j though, on the other hand, to let these villains escape, who were the authors of his misery, might be the ruin of us all. "Well," said he, "do as you
think fit;" and so accordingly, I fired, killed one of the
captain's chief enemies and wounded the other, who eagerly
called for assistance j but the captain who had reserved
his piece, coming up to him, "Sirrnh," said he, "'tis too>
<' late to call for assistance, you should rather cry to God to
pardon your villany;" and so knocked him down with
the stock of his gun; three others were also slightly wound-
ed, who at my approach cried out for help. This the captain granted, upon condition that they would swear to be
true to him in recovering the ship, which they solemnly did}
however I obliged the captain to keep them bound. After
which I sent Friday and the captain's mate to secure the
boat and bring away the oars and sails; when, at their re-
turn, three men coming back, and seeing their late distrefsed
Captain now their conqueror, submitted to be bound also.
And then it was, that having more liberty, I related the ad-
ventures of my whole life, which he heard with a serious
and wonderful attention. After this, I carried him and his
two companions into my little fortified castle; showed them
all my conveniences, and refreshed them with such provi-
sions, as I could afford. When this was over, we began to
consider about regaining the ship. He said that there were
twenty-six hands on board, who knowing their lives were
forfeited by the law for conspiracy and mutiny, were so very
hardened, that it would be dangerous for our small company
to attack them. This was a reasonable inference indeed;
but something we must resolve on, and immediately put in
execution. We therefore heaved the boat upon the beach
so high that she could not shoot off at high water mark, and
broke a hole in her not easily to be stopped; so that all the
signals they gave for the boat to come on board were in
vain. This obliged them to send another boat ashore, with
ten men armed, whose faces the captain plainly descried,
the boatswain being the chief officer; but he said there
were three honest lads among them, who were forced
into the conspiracy. Hereupon I gave him fresh courage
(for I had perceived he was in concern) in the mean while securing our prisoners, except two, whom we took to our
assistance, we thought ourselves able enough to adventure
a battle. When the sailors landed, and beheld their boat
in that condition, they not only hallooed, but.fired for their
companions to hear, yet they received no answer. This
struck them with horror and amazement; and thinking their
companions were murdered, they made as if they would re-
turn to the ship. I could |. tceivc the captain's counte-
nance change at this, till of a sudden, three men were or-
dered to look after the boat, while the other seven leapt on
shore in order to search for their companions; and, indeed,
they came to the brow of the hill, near my ancient castle,
from whence they could see to a great distance in the woods,
and there shouting and hallooing, till tired and weary, they
at length seated themselves under a spreading tree. My
opinion was, that nothing could be done till night, when I might use some artifice to get them all out of the boat; But
of a sudden they started up, and made to the sea-side;
hereupon I ordered Friday and the Captain's mate to go
over the creek, and halloo as loud as they could, and so de-
coying them into the woods, come round to me again. And
this, indeed, had good effect; for they followed the noise,
till coming westward to the creek, they called for their boat
to carry them over, and, taking one of the men out of her, left two to look alter her, having fastened her to the stump
of a little tree on shore. Hereupon immediately the captain and our party passing the creek, out of their sight, w»
surprised them both, by tlve Captain's knocking down one,
and ordering the other to surrender upon pain of death,
and who being the honestest of them all, sincerely joined
with us. By this time it was pretty late; when the rest
returning to their boat, which they found aground in the
creek, the tide out, and the men gone, they ran about wring-
ing their hands, crying it was an enchanted island, and that
they should be all murdered by spirits or devils. My men
would willingly have fallen upon them, but I would not
agree to hazard any of our party. But, to be more certain,
Friday and the captain crawled upon their hands and feet,
as near as possible; and when the boatswain approached
in sight, so eager was the captain that he fired and killed
him on the spot; Friday wounded the next man, and a third
ran away. Hereupon I advanced with my whole army;
and, it being dark, I ordered the man we had surprised in
the boat, to call them by their names, and to parley with
them. Accordingly he called out aloud, "Tom Smith,
Tom Smith!" He answered, "Who's that?" « Robinson!"
answered the other. "For God's sake Tom, surrender
"immediately, or you're all dead men." "Who must we
surrender to r" says Smith. "To.our Captain and fifty men
here, who have taken me prisoner, wounded Will Frye,
and killed the boatswain." "Shall we have quarters,
then?" said he. Hereupon the captain calls out, "You
"Smith, you know my voice, surrender immediately, and
you shall have all yourlives granted, except Will Atkins."
Hereupon Atkins cried out, " What have I done, Captain,
'.' more than the rest, who have betn-as bad as me f" But
that was a lie, for he was the person that laid hold of him, and bound him, However, he was ordered to submit to the
governor's mercy, for such was I called. And so, laying'
down their arms, we bound them all, and seized on their
boat.
After this, the captain expostulated with them, telling
them that the governor was an Englishman, who might ex.-
ecute them there; but he thought they would all be sent to
England, except Will Atkins, who was ordered to prepare
for death the nextmorning. Hereupon Atkins implored the
Captain to intercede for his life, and the rest begged they
might not be sent to England. This answered our project
for seizing the ship. For after sending Atkins and two of
the worst fast bound to the cave, and the rest being com-
mitted to my bower, I sent the captain to treat with them
in the governor's name, offering them pardon if they would
assist in recovering the ship. Upon which they all promis-
ed to stand by him to the last drop of their blood; and who-
ever acted treacherously, should be hanged in chains upon the beach. They were all released on these assurances;
and then the captain repaired to the other boat, making his
passenger Captain of her, and gave him four men well arm-
ed; while himself, his mate, and five more, went in the
other boat. By midnight they came within call of the ship,
when the Captain ordered Robinson to hail her, and tell
them that with great difficulty they had found the men at
last. But while they were discoursing, the captain, his
mate, and the rest entered, and knocked down the second
mate and carpenter, secured those that were upon the deck,
by putting them under hatches, while the other boat's crew
entered and secured the forecastle; they then broke into
the roundhouse, where the mate, after some resistance, shot
the pirate captain through the head, upon which all the rest
yielded themselves prisoners. And thus the ship being re-
covtred, the joyful signal was fired, which I heard with
the greatest joy imaginable: nor was it long before he
brought the ship to an anchor at the creek's mouth, where
coming to me unawares, "There," says he, "my dearest
"friend and deliverer, there is your ship, and we are your
"servants :'' a comfort so unspeakable, as made me swoon
in his arms, while, with gratitude to heaven, we were ten-
derly embracing each other.
Nothing now remained, but to consult what we should
do with the prisoners, whom he thought it was not safe to
take on board. Hereupon concerting with the captain, I
dressed myself in one of his suits, and sending for them, told
them, that I was going to leave the island with all my peo>
pTe, if they would tarry there, their lives should be spared,
if not, they should be hanged at the first port they came at.
They agreed to stay. Hereupon I told them my whole story,
charging them to be kind to the Spaniards, that were ex-
pected, giving them al^my armsrand informing them ofevery
thing necessary for their subsistence, after which, I and my
man Friday went on board. But the next morning, twoofth*
men came swimming to the ship's side, desiring the captain to take them on board, though he hanged them afterwards,
complaining mightily how barbarously the others used them. Upon which I prevailed with the captain to take them in;
and being severely whipt and pickled, they proved more
honest for the future. And so 1 bid farewell to this island,
carrying along with me my money, my parrot, umbrella, and goat-skin cap; setting sail December 12, 1686, after
twenty-eight years, two months, and nineteen days resi-
dence, that same day and month that I'escaped from Salee,.
landing in England June II, 1687, after fiv-e and thirty
years absence from my own country, which rendered me
altogether a stranger there.
Here I found my first Captain's widow alive, who had-
buried a second husband, but in very mean circumstances,
and whom I made easy upon his account. Soon after, I
went down to Yorkshire, where all my family was expired,
except two sisters, and as many of one of my brother's
children. I found no provision had been made for me, they concluding I had been long since dead; so that I was
but in a very slender station. Indeed the captain did me
a great kindness, by his report to the owners, how I had
delivered their ship on the Desolate Island, upon which they
made me a present of 2001. sterling. 1 nex.t went to Lis-
bon, taking my man Friday with me, and there arriving in
April, I met the Portuguese captain, who had taken me on
board on the African coast; but, being ancient, he had left
off the sea, and resigned all his business to his son, who
followed the Brazil trade. So altered both of us were, that
we did not know each other at first, till I discovered my-
self more fully to him. After a few embraces, I began to
inquire of my concerns; and then the old gentleman told
me, that it was nine years since he had been at Brazil,
where my partner was then living, but my trustees were
both dead; that he believed I should have a good account
of the product of my plantation; that the imagination of my being lost had obliged my trustees to give an estimate
of my share to the procurator fiscal, who, in case of my not
returning, had given one-third to the king, and the rest to
the monastery of St. Augustine; but if I put in my claim,
or anyone for me, it would be returned,except the yearly
product which was given to the poor. I then desired them
to tell me what improvement he thought had been made on my plantation, and whether he imagined it was worth my
while to look after it? he answered he did not know how
much it was improved; but this he was certain of, that my
partner was grown vastly rich upon his half of it; and, that
he had been informed, that the king had 200 moidores per
annum for his third part. He added, that the survivors of
my trustees were persons of an ingenuous character: that
my partner could witness my title, my name being register-
ed in the country, by which means I should indispensably
recover considerable sums of money. But, answered I, how could my trustees dispose of my effects, when I mad*
you only my heir? This, said he, was true; but, there be-
ing no affidavit made of my death, he could not act as my
executor. However, he had ordered his son, (then at Bra-
zil) to act by procuration upon my account, and he had
taken possession of my sugar-house, having accounted him-
self for eight years with my partner and trustees for the pro-
fits, of which he would give me a very good account.
And indeed, this he performed very faithfully in a few
days, making himself indebted to me 470 moidores of gold,
over and above what had been lost at sea, after I had left
the place. And then he recounted to me what misfortunes
he had gone through, which forced my money out of his
hands, to buy a part in a new ship: "But," says he, " you
"shall not want, take this; and, when my son returns,
"every farthing shall be paid you." Upon which he put
into my hand a purse of 150 moidores in gold; as likewise
the instrument, containing the title to the ship which his
son was in, and which he offered as security for the remain-
der. But really when I saw so much goodnefs, generosity,
tenderness, and real honesty, I had not the heart to accept
it, for fear he should straiten himself upon my account.--
"It is true," said he, " it may be so; but then the money
is yours, not mine, and you may have the greatest occa-
"sion for it." However I returned fifty of them back
again, promising that 1 would freely forgive him tiic other

hundred when I got my effects into my hands, and fhat I
designed to go myself for that purpose. But he told me
he could save me that trouble, and so caused me to enter
my name with a public notary, as likewise my affidavit, with
a procuration affixed to it; and this he ordered me to send
in a letter to one of his acquaintance, a merchant in Brazil;
and indeed, nothing could be more faithfully and honour-
ably observed; for, in seven months time, I had a very faith-
ful account of all my effects, what sums of money were
raised, what expended, and what remained for my use: in a word I found myself to be worth 50001. sterling, and 10001.
per annum. Nor was this all; for my partner congratulated
me upon my being alive, telling me how much my planta-
tion was improved; what Negroes were at work, and how
many Ave Marias he had said to the Virgin Mary for my
preservation; desiring me to accept kindly some presents he
had sent me, which I found showed the greatest generosity.'
No sooner did the ship arrive, but I rewarded my faith-
ful Captain, by returning him the hundred moidores, and
not only forgave him all he owed me, but I allowed him yearly
a hundred more, and fifty to his son, during their lives. And
now being resolved to go to England, I returned letters of
thanks to the Prior of St. Augustine, and in particular to my
old partner, with very suitable presents. By the Captain's
advice, I was persuaded to go by land to Calais, and there
take pafsage for England; when, as it happened, I got a
young English gentleman, a merchant's son at Lisbon, to ac-
company me, together with two English, and two Portu-
fuese gentlemen; so that with a Portuguese servant, an
English sailor, and my man Friday, there were nine of us in
number.
Thus armed and equipped, we set out, and came to Ma-
drid, when the summer decaying, we hasted to Navarre,
where we were informed, that there was scarcely any pas-
sing, by reason of the prodigious quantity of snow; so that
we were obliged to abide near twenty days at Pampeluna,
and at last to take a guide to conduct us safe towards Tho-
louse. And now twelve other gentlemen joining with us,
together with their servants, we had a very jolly company.
Away our guide led us by frightful mountains, and through
so many intricate mazes and windings, that we insensibly
passed them, which, as we travelled along, ushered us into the prospect of the fruitful and charming provinces of Languedoc and Gascoigne.
But now came on two adventures, both tragical and co-
mical. First, our guide was encountered by three wolves
and a bear, who set upon him and his horse, and wounded
him in three places; upon which my man, riding up to his
assistance, shot one of them dead upon the spot, which
made the others retire into the woods. But the pleasanteH
adventure was to behold my man attack the bear. Tii
»uch a creature, that if you let him alone, he will never
meddle with you; and this my man very well knew, and
so begging leave of me in broken English, he told us, " he
"would make good laugh." "Why, you silly fool," said
I, " he'll eat you up at a mouthful." "Eatee me up," re-
plied he, by way of scorn, "me not only eatee him, but
"make much good laugh." Upon which, pulling off his
boots, he claps on his pumps, and running after the monstrous
beast, he called out that he wanted to discourse with him,
and then throwing stones on purpose to incense him, the
beast turns about in fury, and, with prodigious strides,"
shuffles after him. But though he was not swift enough to
keep pace with Friday, who made up to us as it were
for help; yet being angry, " You dog," said 1, '' immedi-
'* ately take horse, and let us shoot the creature." But he
cried, "Dear master, no shoot, me make you laugh much."
And so he turned about, making signs to follow, while the
bear ran after, till coming to a great oak, he ascended in a.
minute, leaving his gun at the bottom of it. Nor did the
bear make any difficulty of it, but ascendediikeacat, though
his weight was very great. You mu,t consider I was not
a little amazed at the folly of my man, as not perceiving any
thing to occasion our laughter, till such time as we rode up
nearer and beheld the beast mounted upon the oak, on the beginning of the same branch, to which Friday clung at th*
farther end, where the bear durst not come. Hereupon
Friday cried out, "Now, master, me make much laugh, me make bear dance." Upon which he fell a shaking th«
bough, which made the creature look behind him, to see how he could retreat. Then, as if the bear had understood
his stammering English; "Why you no come farther,Mr.
"Bearr" said he; " pray Mr. Bear, come far here;" and
then indeed we all burst into a laughter, especially when
we perceived Friday drop like a squirrel upon the ground,
leaving the beast to make the best of his wav down the tiee. M
And now thinking it the most convenient time to shoot the
creature, Friday cried out, "O dear master, no shoot, me
"shoot by and by"; when taking up the gun, "me no
shoot yet," said he, "me make one more much laugh."
And accordingly he was as good as his word; for the crea-
ture descending backward from the tree very leisurely, be-
fore he could lay one foot on the ground, Friday shot him
through the ear, stone dead; and looking to see whether
we were pleased, he burst out into a hearty laughter, say-
ing, " So we kill de bear in my country, not with the gun,
"but with much long arrows." Thus ended our diversion
to our great satisfaction; especially in a place where the
terrible howlings struck us with a continual terror. But
the snows now growing very deep, particularly on the
mountains, the ravenous creatures were then obliged to seek
for sustenance in the villages, where coming by surprise on
the country people, killed several of them, besides a great
number of their sheep and horses. Our guide told us, we had yet one more dangerous place
to pass by; and if there were any more wolves in the coun-
try, there we should find them. This was a small plain
encompassed with woods, to get through a long lane to the
village where we were to lodge. When we entered the
wood, the sun was within half an hour of setting; and a
little after it was set, we came into the plain, which was
not above two furlongs over", and then we perceived five
great wolves cross the road, without taking notice of us,
and so swilt as though they were pursuing after their prey.
Hereupon our guide, believing there were more coming,
desired us to be upon our guard. Accordingly our eyes
were very circumspect, till about half a league farther, we
perceived a dead horse, and near a dozen of wolves devour-
ing its carcase. My man Friday fain would have firtd at
them, but I would not permit him; nor had we gone half
over the plain, but we heard dreadful howlings in a wood
on our left, when presently we saw a hundred come up
against us, as though they had been an experienced ai i;.\.
This obliged us to tbrm ourselves in the best manner^ paA
then I ordered that every other man should fire; and those
who did not, might be ready to give a second volley, should they advance upon us; and then every man should make
use of his pistols. But there was no necessity for this; for
enemy being terrified, stopped at the noise of the fire; four of them Were shot dead, and several others being
wounded, went bleeding away, as we could very plainly
discover by the snow. And now remembering what had
been often told me, that such was the majesty of a man's
voice, as to strike terror even in the fiercest creatures, I or-
dered all our companions to halloo, as loud as pofsible ; and
in this notion I was not altogether mistaken; for they im-
mediately turned about upon the first halloo, and began to
retire; upon which, ordering a second volley in their
rear, they gallopped into the woods with great precipitation.
Thus we had some small time to load our pieces again,
and then made all the haste we could on our way; but we
had not rode far, before we were obliged to put ourselves
in a posture of defence as before, being alarmed with a very
dreadful noise in the same wood, on our left hand, the same
way as we were to pass, only that it was some distance
from us. By this time the darksome clouds began to spread
over the elements, and the night growing very dusky, made
it so much the more to our disadvantage; but still the noise
increasing, we were fully afsured that it was the howling
and yelling ot those ravenous creatures; when presently
three troops of wolves on our front, appeared in sight, as
though a great number of them had a design to surround us,
and devour us in spite of fate. But as they did not fail
upon us immediately, we proceeded on our journey in as s wiit
a manner as the roads would permit our horses, which was
only a large trot. It was in this manner we travelled, till
such a time as we discovered another wood, and had the
prospect of its entrance, through which we were to pass, at
the farthest side of the plain. But surely none can express the terror we were in, when approaching the lane, we per-
ceived a confused number of ihe fiercest wolves, standing,
as it were, guarding its entrance. Nor were we long in
this amazement, before another occasion of horror present-
ed itself; for suddenly we heard the report of a gun at ano-
ther opening in the wood; and looking that way, out ran a
horse bridled and saddled, flying with the greatest swiftness, and no less than sixteen or seventeen wolves pursuing after
him, in order to devour the poor creature; and unquestion-
ably they did so, after thev had run him down, not being able
to hold out that swiftness with which he at first escaped
them.
MS
When we rode up to that entrance from whence the horse
came forth, there lay the carcase of another horse and two
men, mangled and torn by these devouring wolves: and un-
doubtedly one of these men was the person who fired the
gun which we had heard, for the piece lay by him; but,
alas! most of the upper part of his body and his head were
entombed in the bowels of these ravenous creatures.
What course to take, whether to proceed or retreat, we
could not tell; but it was not long before the wolves them-
selves made us to come to a resolution; for such numbers
surrounded us, every one of whom expected their prey,
that were our bodies to be divided among them, there would
not be half a mouthful a-piece. But happy, very happy it
was for us, that but a little way from the entrance, there lay
some very large timber trees, which I supposed had been
rut down and laid there for sale; amongst which I drew my
little troop, placing ourselves in a line behind one long tree,
which served us for a breast-work, when desiring them to
alight, we stood in a triangle, or three fronts, closing our
bodies in the centre, the only place where we could pre-
serve them.
Never certainly was there a more furious charge than
what the wolves made upon us in this place: and the sight
of the horses, which was the principal prey they aimed at,
provoked their hunger and added to their natural fiercenefs.
They came on us with a most dreadful noise, that made the
woods ring again; and beginning to mount the pieces of
timber, 1 ordered every man to fire, as before directed:
and, indeed, so well did they take their aim, that they killed
several of the wolves at the first volley; but still we were
obliged to keep a continual firing, by reason they came on
like devils, pushing one another with the greatest fury.—
But our second volley something abated their courage, when
stopping a little, we hoped they would have made the best
of their way; however, it did not prove so, for others made
a new attempt upon us; and though in four firings we killed
seventeen or eighteen of them, laming twice as many, yet
they several times successively came on, as though they
valued not their lives for the sake of their prey.
Unwilling was 1 to spend our last shot too suddenly, and
therefore calling my other servant, and giving him a horn
of powder, bid him lay a large train quite along the timber,
which he did, while Friday was charging my fusee and his own, with the greatest dexterity. By this time the wolves
coming up the timber, I set fire to the train, by snapping a
discharged pistol close to the powder. This so scorched
and terrified them, that some fell down, and others jumped
in among us; but these were immediately dispatched,
when all the rest, frightened with the light, which the dark-
some night caused to appear more dreadful, began at length
to retire; upon which, ordering our last pistols to be fired
at once, giving at the same time a great shout, the wolves
were obliged to have recourse to their swiftness, and turn
tail; and then we sallied out upon twenty lame ones, cut-
ting them in pieces with our swords, which obliged them
to howl lamentably, to the terror of their fellows, who re-
signed to us the fields as victorious conquerors. And, in-
deed, I question whether Alexander, king of Macedonia,
in any of his conquests, had more occasion for triumph than
we had; for he was but attacked with numerous armies of
soldiers, whereas our little army was obliged to combat a
legion of devils, as it were, worse than the cannibals, who,
the same moment they had slain us, would have sacrificed
us, to satisfy their voracious appetites.
Thus ended our bloody battle with the beasts, having
killed threescore of them, and saved our lives from their
fury. We still had a league farther to go, when, as we
went, our ears were saluted with their most unwelcome
howlings, and we expected every moment another attack.
But, in an hour's time, we arrived at the town where we
were to lodge; and here we found the place strictly guard-
ed, and all in terrible confusion, as well they might, for
fearofthebearsand wolves breaking intothe village, in order
to prey upon their cattle and people. The next morning
we were obliged to take a new guide, by reason the other
fell very bad of his wounds, which he had received, as be-
fore mentioned. After we had reached Tho.ulouse, we
came into a warm, pleasant, and fruitful country, not infest-
ed with wolves, nor any sort of ravenous creatures; and
when we told our story there, they much blamed our guide,
for conducting us through the forest at the foot of the moun-
tains, in such a severe season, when the snow obliged the
wolves to seek for shelter in the woods. When we inform-
ed them in what manner we placed ourselves, and the
horses in the centre, they exceedingly reprehended us, and
M 3
tokl us, it was an hundred to one but we had been all destroyed; for that it was the very sight of the horses, (their
so much desired prey) that made the wolves more ragingly
furious than they would have been, which was evident, by
their beingat other times really afraid of a gun; but then
being exceedingly hungry and furious upon that account,
their eagerness to come at the horses made them insensible
of their danger; and that, if we had not, by a continual
fire. and at last by the cunning stratagem of the train of
powder, got the better of them, it had been great odds if
their number had not overpowered us; besides, it was a
great mercy we alighted from our horses, and fought them
with that courage and conduct, which, had we failed to do,
every man of us, with our beasts, had been devoured; and,
indeed, this was nothing but truth; for never, in my life,
was I so sensible of danger, as when three hundred devils
came roaring upon us, to shun whose unwelcome company,
ir 1 was sure to meet a storm every week, I would rather
go a thousand leagues by sea.
I think I have nothing uncommon in my passage through
France to take notice of, since other travellers of greater
learning and ingenuity, have given a more ample account
than my pen is able to set forth. From Thoulouse I travel-
led to Paris, from thence to Calais, where I took shipping,
and landed at Dover the 14th of January, in a very cold
.season.
Thus come to the end of my travels, I soon discovered
my new found estate, and all the bills of exchange I had
were currently paid. The good ancient widow, my only
privy-counsellor, thought no pains or cares too great to pro-
cure my advantage; nor had I ever occasion to blame her
fidelity, which drew from me an ample reward. I was for
leaving my effects in her hands, intending to set out for
Lisbon, and to the Brazils; but, as in the Desolate Island,
I had some doubts about the Romish religion, so I knew
there was little encouragement to settle there, unless I
would apostatize from the orthodox faith, or live ir. conti-
nual fear of the inquisition. Upon this account I resolved
to sell my plantation; and, for that intent, I wrote to my
old friend at Lisbon, who returned me an answer to my great
satisfaction; which was, that he would sell it to good ac-
count; however, if I thought it convenient to give him li-
beriy to offer it in my name to the two merchants, the sur.
6
vivors of my trustees, residing at Brazils, who consequently
knew its intrinsic value, having lived just upon the spot,
and who I was sensible were very rich, and therefore might
be the more willing to purchase it: he did not in the least
doubt, but that I should make four or five thousand pieces
of eight more of it, than I could if I disposed of it in any
other manner whatsoever.
You may be sure I could not but agree with this kind and
ingenuous proposal; and immediately I sent him an order to offer it to them, which he accordingly did; so that about
eight months after, the ship being in that time returned, he
gave me a satisfactory account, that they not only willingly
accepted the offer, but that they had also remitted 33,OOO
pieces of eight to a correspondent of their own at Lisbon,
in order to pay for the purchase.
Hereupon, in return, I signed the instrument of sale, ac-
cordingto form, which they had sent from Lisbon, and re-
turned it again to my old friend, he having sent me, for my
estate, bills of three hundred and twenty-eight thousand
pieces of eight, reserving the payment of one hundred moidores per annum, which I had allowed him during life,
likewise fifty to his son during life also, according to my
faithful promise, which the plantation was to make good at
a rent charge.
And thus having led my reader to the knowledge of th«
first parts of my life, so remarkable for the many peculiar
providences that attended it, floating in the ocean of uncer-
tainty and disappointment, of adversity and prosperity, beginning foolishly, and yet ending happily; methinks, now that I am come to a safe and pleasant haven, it is time to
cast out my anchor, and, laying up my yefsel, bid, fo»ia
while, adieu to foreign adventures. I had no other concerns
to look after, but the care of my brother's two sons, which,
with the good widow's persuasions, obliged me to continue
at home seven years. One of these children I bred up a
gentleman, and the other an experienced sailor, remarkable
for his courage and bravery. Besides this, I married a vir-
tuous young gentlewoman, of a very good family, by whom
I had two sons and one daughter. But my dear and tender
wife leaving this earthly stage, (as in the second part of my
life you will hear) which rent my soul, as it were, asunder,
my native country became weary and tiresome to me; and
my nephew happening to come from sea, tempted me tc
venlure another voyage to the East-Indies, which did in
the year 1694, at which time I visited my island, and in-
formed myself of every thing that happened since my de-
parture.
One might reasonably imagine, that what I had suffered,
together with advanced age, and the fear of losing, not only
what I had gotten, but my life also, might have choaked
up all the seeds of youthful ambition and curiosity, and put
a lasting period to my wandering inclinations, feut as no-
thing but death can fully allay the active part of my life, no
less remarkable for the many various contingencies of it,
you will next perceive how I visited my little kingdom,
saw my succefsors the Spaniards, had an account of the
usage they met with from the Englishmen, agreeing and
disagreeing, uniting and separating, till at last they were
subjected to the Spaniards, who yet used them very ho-
nourably, together with the wonderful and succefsful battles
over the Indians who invaded, and thought to have con-
quered the island, but were repelled by their invincible
courage and bravery, having taken eleven men and five
women prisoners, by which, at my return, I found about
twenty young children on my little kingdom. Here I staid
twenty days, left them supplies of all necessary things, as
also a carpenter and smith, and shared the island into parts,
reserving the whole property to myself. Nor will you be
insensible, by the account of these things, of several new
adventuresl have been engaged in, the battles I have fought,
the deliverances I have met with: and while, in the sur-
prising relations of such remarkable occurrences, I shall de-
scribe many of God's kindest providences to me in particular, no less conspicuous in the same goodness, power, and
majesty of our great Creator, shown one way or other, over
the face of the earth, if duly adverted to.
THE FURTHER ADVENTURES Of
ROBINSON CRUSOE.
Wherein are contained several strange and surprising account*
- of his Travels, and Ids most remakaible ^Transactions both by
Sea and land; with his •wonderful vision of the dngelic World.
WHEN we consider the puifsant force of Nature, and
what mighty influence it has many times over the
temper of the mind, it will be no such great wonder to tliink,
that my powerful reason should be overcome by a much
stronger inclination. My late acquired kingdom ran con-
tinually in my thoughts all the day, and I dreamed of it in
the night: nay, I made it the continual subject of my talk,
even to impertinence, when I was awake. I had such va-
pours in my head, that I actually supposed myself at my
casile ; .that I not only perceived Friday's father, the old
Spaniard, and the wicked sailors, but that I talked and dis-
coursed with them about their manner of living; thai 1 heard
the things related to me, which I found afterwards to bs
too true; and that I executed my judgments with the greatest
severity upon the offenders. And, indeed, this anticipating
all the pleasing joys of my life, scarcely afforded iv.s one
pleasant hour: my dear and tender wife could not but take
notice of it, which drew those affectionate speeches from
her: "My dear," said she, " I am really persuaded that
"some secret impulse from Heaven occasions in you a de-
"termination to see the island again ; nor am I lefs sensible,
but your being engaged to me and these dear children, is
the only hindrance ofyour departure. I know, my dear,
if I were in the grave, you would not long continue at
home; prevent not your happinefs on my account, whose
only comfort centres in you. All that 1 can. object is, that
such an hazardous undertaking is no way consistent with
a person of your years; but if you are resolved to go,"
added she, weeping, "only permit me to bear you com-
"pany, and that is all that I desire."
Such endearing tenderness, graced with the most inno-
cent, and yet most powerful charms, brought me insensibly
into my right understanding ; and when I considered all the transactions of my life, and particularly my new engage-
ment; that I had now one child already born, and my wife*
big of another; and that I had no occasion to seek for more
riches, who already was blessed with sufficiency, with much struggling I altered my resolutions at last, resolving to apply
myself to some business or other, which might put a period
to such wandering inclinations. Hereupon I bought a little
farm in the county of Bedford, with a resolution tc move
thither; upon this there was a pretty convenient house,
surrounded with land, very capable of improvement, which
suited my temper, as to planting, managing, and cultivating.
Nor was 1 long before I entered upon my new settlement,
having bought ploughs, harrows, carts, waggons, horses,
cows, and sheep ; so that I now led the life of a country
gentleman, and as happy in my retirement as tht: greatest
monarch in the world. And what made me think my happiness the greater was, that I was in the middle state of
life, which my father had so often recommended, much re-
sembling the felicity of a rural retirement, which is elegantly
described by the poet in these lines:
Free from att vfces* free from care,
Age has no pain, and youth no snare.
But in the midst of this my happiness, I wss suddenly
plunged in the greatest sorrow that I could possibly endure;
for, when I least expected it, my dear and tender wife was
forced to submit to the irresistible power of death, leaving
this transitory life for a better. It is impossible for me to
express the beauties of her mind, or the loveliness of her
Eerson; neither can I too much lament her loss, which my
latest breath shall record; her influence was greater over
me than the powers of my own reason, the importunities of
friends, the instructions of a father, or the melting tears of a
tender and disconsolate mother; in a word, she was the
spirit of all my affairs, and the centre of my enterprizes—But now, since the cruel hand of death had closed my dear-
est'seyeSj 1 seemed in my thoughts a stranger to the world;
my privy-counsellor being gone, I was like a ship without a
pilot, that could only run before the wind. And when I
looked around me in this busy world, one part labouring
for bread, and the other squandering away their estates;
this put me in mind how I had lived in my little kingdom,
wliere both reason and religion dictated to me, that there
was something that certainly was the reason and end of life,
which was far superior to what could be hoped for on this
side the grave. My country delights were now as insipid
and dull, as music and science to those who have neither
taste nor ingenuity. In short, resolving to leave off house-
keeping, 1 left my farm, and in a few months returned to
London.
But neither could that great city, so famous for its variety
of entertainment, afford me any agreeable delight; a state
of idleness I found to be the very dregs of life, and most
hurtful to body and soul. It was now the beginning of the
year 1(584, at which time my nephew (who, as I before ob-
served had been brought up to the sea, and advanced to be
captain of a ship) was returned from a short voyage to Bil-
boa, the first he had made in that station. He comes to me
one morning, telling me, that some merchants of his ac-
quaintance had proposed to him to go a voyage for them to
the East-Indies and China, in the manner of private traders;
"and now uncle," said he, "if you'll accompany me thither,
I'll engage to land you upon your own island, to visit the
state of your little kingdom."
Just before he came in, my thoughts were fixed to get a
patent for its possession, and then to fill it with inhabitants.
After I had paused a while, and looked stedfastly on him,
"Wliat devil or spirit," said I, " sent you with this un-
lucky errand r" He started at first; but recovering him-
self, when he perceived I was not offended, "Sir," replied
he, "what I have proposed cannot, I hope, be styled un-
lucky, since certainly you must be desirous to see your little
territory, where you reigned with more content than any of
your brother kings in the universe."—" Nephew," said I,
"if you will leave me there, and call for me as you come
back, I care not if I give my consent:" but he answered,
that the merchants would not allow their vessel, loaded with an infinite value, to return there again, which was a
month's sail out of the way; "besides, Sir," said he, "if I
should miscarry, was your request granted, why then you
would be locked up as before." This, indeed, carried a
great deal of reason in it; but we found out a remedy, an I
that was to carry a framed sloop on board, ready to be set
up in the island, by the assistance of some carpenters, which
we should carry with us, that might be fitted in a few days to go to sea. I was not long in forming my resolution,
which overswayed my good friend, the widow's, persuasions,
and the natural affection I bore to my young children. I
made my will, and settled my estate in' such manner, that I
was perfectly sure my poor infants would have justice done
them. The good widow not only undertook to make pro-
vision for my voyage, but also took the charge of my do-
mestic affairs, and to provide for my children's education;
and indeed no mother could take more care, or understood
the office better; for which I lived to reward and refurn
her my hearty thanks.
The beginning of January, 1694-5, my nephew being
ready to sail, I and Friday went on board in the Downs on
the 8th, having, besides that sloop already mentioned, a
very considerable cargo for my new colony. First, I had
'ome servants, whom I proposed to leave there, as they
should appear willing; there were two carpenters, a smith,
and a very ingenious fellow who was Jack-of-all-trades; for
he was not only a cooper by trade, but also was dextrous at
making wheels, and hand-mills to grind corn, likewise a
good turner, and a good pot-maker. 1 also carried a tailor,
who consented to stay in my plantation, and proved a most
necessary fellow in the island. As to my cargo, it consisted
of a sufficient quantity of linen, and English stuffs for cloth-
ing the Spaniards that I expected to find there; as likewise
gloves, hats, shoes, stockings; together with beds, bedding,
and household stuff, especially kitchen utensils, with pots,
kettles, pewter, brass, &c. also nails, tools of all sorts,
staples, hooks, hinges, and all other things necessary ; all
which, I think, cost me about three hundred pounds. Nor
was this all; for I carried a hundred spare arms, markets
and fusees, besides some pistols, a considerable quantity of
several sorts of shot, two brass cannon, besides swords,
cutlasses, and the iron part of some pikes and halberts. I made my nephew take with us two small quarter-deck
guns, more than he had occasion for in his ship, to leave be-
hind, if there was a necessity; so that we might build a
fort there, and man it against all opposers whatsoever. Well, we put out to sea, and though I can't say this
voyage was so unprosperous as my others ha.d been, yet
contrary winds drove us so far nothward, that we were
obliged to put in at Galway, in Ireland, where we lay
wind-bound Iwo and twenty days. Here, indeed, our j ro-
visions were very cheap, and we added to our ship's stores
by taking several live hogs, two cows and calves, which I
then resolved to put on shore in my island, if our necessities did not call for them. On the Sth of February we sailed
from Ireland, with a very fair gale, which lasted for some
days; and I think it was about the 20th of the same monthj
late in the evening, when the mate informed us, that he
saw a flash of fire, and heard a gun fired t and when he was
speaking, a boy came in and told us, that the boatswain had
heard another. Upon which vfe all ran to the quarter deck>
from whence, in a few moments, we perceived a terrible
fire at a distance. We had immediately recourse to our
reckonings, in which we were all of opinion, that there
could be no land that way, it appearing to be atN. N. W.
Hereupon we concluded that some ship had taken fire at
sea, and that it could not be far off, by the report of the
guns which we had heard. We made up directly to it, and
in half an hour's time, the wind being fair, we could plainly
perceive a great ship on fire, in the middle of the sea.—
Touched with this unhappy disaster, and considering my
former circumstances, when the Portuguese Captain took
me up, I immediately ordered five guns to be fired, that the
poor creatures, not seeing us, it being dark, (though we
could perceive their flame) might be sensible there was de-
liverance at hand, and consequently might endeavour to
save themselves in their boat. Nor was it long before the
ship blew up in the air, and the fire was extinguished in
the ocean. But supposing them all to be in their boats, we hung out our lanterns, and kept firing till eight o'clock in
the morning; when, with our perspectives, we beheld two
boats full of people, making towards us, though the tide was
against them: then spreading out our ancient, and hanging
out a waft, as a signal for them to come on board, in half an hour's time we came up with them, and took them all in,
there being no less than sixty-four men, women, and chil-
dren. It was a French merchant ship of three hundred tons,
homeward-bound from Quebec, in the river of Canada.—
The master informed me how, by the negligence of the
steersman, the steerage was set on tire: that, at his outcry for help, the fire was, as he thought, totally extinguished;
but that some sparks getting between the timber and within
the ceiling, it proceeded into the hold, where there was na
resisting it; and then they got into their boats, as creatures
in the last extremity, with what provision they had, together
with oars, sails, and a compass, intending to go back to
Newfoundland, the wind blowing at S. E. and by E. though
there were several chances against them, as storms to over-
set and founder them, rains and colds to benumb and perish
their limbs, and contrary winds to keep them back and
starve them; but, said he, in this our great distress, we
heard the welcome report of your guns, when, with unspeak-
able joy, taking down our masts and sails, we were resolved
to lie by till morning; but perceiving your light, we set
our oars at work, to keep our boat ahead, the sooner to
attain your ship, the happy instrument of our deliverance. Indeed no one can express the joy of these poor crea-
tures on this occasion; fear and grief are easily set forth;
sighs and tears, with a few motions of the hands and head,
all are the demonstrations of these passions; but an excess of joy carries in it a thousand extravagances; especially,
I think, among the French, whose temper is allowed to be
more volatile, passionate, sprightly, and gay, than that of
other nations. Some were weeping, tearing themselves in
the greatest agonies of sorrow, and running stark mad about
the ship, while the rest were stamping with their feet,
wringing their hands, singing, laughing, swooning away,
vomiting, fainting, with a few returning hearty thanks to
the Almighty, and crossing themselves. I think, if I am
not mistaken, our surgeon was obliged to let thirty of them
blood. But among the passengers, there were two priests,
the one an old, and the other a young man; but what amazed
me more was, that the oldest was in the worst plight; for
no sooner did he perceive himself freed from danger, but he dropped down, as it were, without life, and to every one's ap-
pearance quite dead; but the surgeon chafing and rubbing
his arm, opened a vein, which at first dropped, and then
flowing more freely, the old man began to open his eyes,
and in a quarter of an hour was well again. But soon re-
Tnembering this happy change, the joy of which whirled his
blood about faster than the vefsels could convey it, he be-
came so feverish, as made him more fit for bedlam than any
other place; but the surgeon giving him a sleepy dose,
he was perfectly composed the next morning.
Remarkable, indeed, was the behaviour of the young
priest. At his entrance on board the ship, he fell on his face in the most humble prostration to the Almighty. I thought,
indeed, he had fallen into a swoon, and so ran to help him
up; but he modestly told me, he was returning thanks to
the Almighty, desiring me to leave him a few moments,
and that, next to his Creator, he would return me thanks
also. And indeed he did so, about three minutes after, with
great seriousness and affection, while the tears stood in his
eyes, which convinced me of the gratitude of his soul. Nor
did he less show his piety and wisdom, in applying himseit
'to his country people, and labouring to compost: ti.e:ii, by
the most powerful reasons, arguments, and persuasions.--.
And when, indeed, these people had taken their night's re-
pose, in such lodgings as our ship would allow, we found
nothing but the best of manners, and the most civil acknow-
ledgments, for which the French are eminently remarkable.
The next day the captain and one of the priests desired to
speak with me and my nephew the commander. They
told us, that they had saved some money and valuable things
out of the ruined vessel, which was at our service; only that they desired to be set on shore some where in our way.
At the first my nephew was for accepting the money; but
I (who knew how hard my case would have been, had the
Portuguese captain served me so) persuaded him to the con-
trary; and therefore told them, that as we had done nothing
but what we were obliged to do, by nature and humanity,
and what we ourselves might expect from others in such
calamity, so we took them up to save them, not to plunder
them, or leave them naked upon the land,to perish for
want of subsistence, and therefore would not accept their
money: but as to landing them, that was a great difficulty;
for being bound to the East-Indies, it was mipofsible, wil-
fully, to change our voyage upon their particular account,
nor could my nephew (who was under charter party to
pursue it by way of Brazil) answer it to the freighters.—
All that we could do, was to put ourselves in the way of
meeting some ships homeward-bound from the West-Indies,
that, if possible, they might get a passage to France or
England. Indeed, they were very thankful for our first
kindnefa; but were under great concern, especially the
passengers; at their being carried to the East-Indies. They
begged, therefore, I would keep on the banks of Newfound-
land, where probably they might meet with some ship or N 2
sloop, to carry them to Canada, whence they came. As this was but a reasonable request, I was inclined to grant it,
since it was no breach of charter party, and the laws of God
and nature obliged us to do what good we could to our
fellow-creatures; and besides the danger we ourselves should be in for want of provisions: so we consented to
carry them to Newfoundland, if wind and weather would
permit; if not that we should carry them to Martinico in
the West-Indies. But, as it happened, in a week's time we made the banks of Newfoundland, where the French
people hired a bark to carry them to France. But the young
priest being desirous to goto the East-Indies, I readily agreed
to it, because I liked his conversation, and two or three of
the French sailors also entered themselves on board our ship.
. Now, directing our course for the West-Indies, steering
S. and S. by E. about twenty days, with little wind, ano-
ther adventure happened to exercise our humanity. In the
latitude of 27 degrees, 5 minutes north, the IDth of March,
j 694-5, we perceived a sail, (our course S. E. and by S.)
which bore upon us, nnd then she appeared to be a larg«
vefsf), having lost her tnain.top-mast and boltsprit; when
fi:ing a gun as a signal of distrefs, windN. N. W. we soon
can:e to speak with her. She was a ship from Bristol, bound
jiumelromBarbadoes, out of which road she had been forced
in a hurricane to the west.war*!, in which they lost their masts.
They told us, their expectations were to see the Bahama
islands, but were driven away by a strong wind at N. N. W.
and having no sails to work the ship with, but the main-
Bourse, and a kind of a square sail upon a jury fore-mast,
because they could not come near the land, were endeavour-
ing to stand for theCanaries: nay, what was worse, besides
all their fatjgue, they were almost starved for want of pro-
Vision, having ate nothing for eleven days; all that they had
aboard was sugar, a barrel of fresh water, and seven casks
of rum. In this ship were pafsengers, a youth, his mother,
and a maid-servant, who were in a most deplorable condition
for want of food. If I had not gone on board their ship,
the knowledge of their misery had been concealed from me,
and they would have inevitably perished, though, indeed,
their second mate who was captain, by reason the true
captain was not on board when the hurricane happened,
had before informed me that there were such persons on
board, whom he supposed to be dead, being afraid to inquire after them, because he had nothing to give them for relief. Hereupon we resolved to let them have what we could
spare, ordering the mate to bring some of his men on board
us, which he did accordingly: as he and they looked like
skeletons, when meat was set before them I ordered them
to eat sparingly. But, however, they soon fell sick; which
obliged the surgeon to mix something in their broth, which
was to be to them both food and physic. When they weru
fed, we ordered our mate to carry them a sack of bread,
and four or five piects of beef; but the surgeon charged
them to see it boiled,and keep a guard on the cook-room, to prevent the men from eating it raw, and consequently
killing themselves with what was designed for their relief.
But, particularly, I desired the mate to see what condition
the poor pafsengers were in, and the surgeon gave him a
pitcher of the same broth which he had prepared for the men. And being curious to see this scene of misery myself,
I took the Captain (as we called the mate of the ship) in .
our own boat, and sailed after them.
Here was a sad sight indeed! scarce were the victuals
half boiled in the pot, but they were ready to break open
the cook-room door. To stay their stomachs, the mate gave
them biscuits, which were dipped and softened with the
liquor of the meat, which they call bruise; telling them it
was for their own safety, that he was obliged to give them
but a little at a time; and so feeding them gradually, their
bellies were comfortably filled, and the men did very well
again. But when they came to the poor gentlewoman in
the cabin, who for several days had continued without food, giving what she had to her son, they found her, as it were, in the arms of death. She was sitting upon the floor of the
deck, with her back up against the sides, between two
chairs, which were lashed fast, and her head shrunk be-
tween her shoulders, like a senseless corpse. Nothing was
wanting in my mate to revive and encourage her; opening
her lips, and putting some broth into her mouth with a spoon. But not having strength to speak, she lifted up her head
with much difficulty, intimating that it was now too late!
at the same time pointing to the youth her son, as though
she desired him to do what he could to save the lad; and,
in a little time after, she died.
The youth, indeed, was not so far gone, yet lay stretched
out on the cabin bed. like one that had scarce anv life, in
N 3
his mouth was a piece of an old glove, the rest of which he
had ate up. At first he vomited what the mate had given
him; but at length began sensibly to revive, though in the
greatest concern for the death of his tender mother. As to the poor maid, she lay by her mistress, like one in
the last pangs of death: her limbs were distorted, one of her
hands was clasped round the frame of a chair, which she
grasped so hard, that it was with some difficulty we sepa-
rated her from it; her other arm lay over her head, and her
feet lay both together, set fast against the frame of the cabin
table; not only being starved with hunger, but overcome
with grief at the loss of her mistress, whom she loved most
tenderly. It was a great while before the surgeon could
bring her to life, and a much longer time before she came
to her senses. After we had sailed with them some days, we sent them
five barrels of beef, one of pork, two hogsheads of biscuit,
with pease, flour, and other things; taking three casks of
sugar, some rum, and some pieces of eight as payment, we
left them, but took the youth and maid with us, with all
their goods. The lad was about seventeen years old, very
haiidsome, modest, sensible, and well-bred, but mightily
concerned for the loss of his honoured mother, having lost
his father at Barbadoes but a few months before. He be-
seeched the surgeon to intercede with me to take him out
of the ship; for that the sailors, not sparing a small suste-
nance, had starved his mother. But hunger has no bounds,
no right, and consequently is incapable of any compassion. When the surgeon told him, our voyage might put him in
bad circumstances, and farther from his friends, he said he
did not care, if he was delivered from that terrible crew;
that as the captain (meaning me) had saved him from death,
so he was sure he would do him no harm; and, as for the
maid, when she was restored to her senses, she would be
no lefs thankful, let us carry them where we would. And
indeed the surgeon so represented their case to me, that I
consented, and took them on board, with all their goods,
except eleven hogsheads of sugar; but the youth having a
bill of lading, I made the commander oblige himself to de-
liver a letter and the deceased widow's goods to Mr. Rogers,
a men ban I in Bristol; but I believe the ship was lost at sea,
for we never could hear win' became of her afterwards. We
were now in the latitude 19 dog. 32 min. having as yet a tolerable good voyage. But, passing by several little incidents relating to wind and weather, I shall relate what is most re-
markable concerning my little kingdom, to which I was
then drawing near. I had great difficulty in finding it, for
as I came to, and went from it before, on the south and east
side of the island, as coming from the Brazils, so now ap-
proaching between the main and the island, not having any
chart of the coast, nor land mark, it obliged us to go on
shore on several islands in the mouth of the river Oroonoko,
but to no purpose. Thus I perceived, that what I thought
was a continent before, was no such thing, but a long island,
or rather a ridge of sands. On one of these islands I found
some Spaniards, but they belonged to the isle de Trinidad,
who came hither in a sloop to make salt, and try to find
some pearl muscles. But at length I came fair on the
south-side of my island, and then I presently knew the
countenance of my little kingdom: so we brought the ship
safe to an anchor, broadside within the creek, where stood
my ancient and venerable castle.
No sooner did I see the place, but calling for Friday, I
asked him where he was? but when he looked a little, he
clapped his hands, crying,-"O joy, O there, O yes, O
there!" pointing to our old abode, and then fell a dancing
and capering as if he was mad, and I had much ado to keep
him from jumping into the sea, to swim ashore. "Friday,"
said I, "what do you think, shall we go to see your father?"
at the mentioning his father's name, the poo'r affectionate
creature fell a weeping: "No, no," says he, " me see him
no more, never^see poor father more! he long ago die, die
long ago; he much old man." "Youdon't know that,"
said I, "but shall we see anybody "else?" He looks about,
and pointing to the hill above my house, cries out, "We
see, wesee there much men and there;" which, though I
could not perceive them with my perspective glass, was
true, by what the men themselves told me the next day.
When the English ancient was spread, and three guns
fired, as a signal of friendship, we perceived a smoke rise
from the creek; upon which I ordered the boat out, taking
Friday with me, and hanging out a white flag of truce, I
went on shore, accompanied also by the young friar, to
whom I had related the history of the first part of my life;
besides, we had sixteen men well armed, in case we had
met with any opposition,
After we had rowed directly into the creek, the first man
t fixed my eye upon was the Spaniard, whose life I had
saved, and whose face I perfectly well knew. I'ordered
them all to stay in the boat for a while; but Friday, per-
ceiving his father at a distance, would have jumped into the
sea, had they not let the boat go. No sooner was he on
shore, but he flew like a swift arrow out of a bow to em-
brace his aged father. Certainly it would melt a man of
the firmest resolution into the softest tears, to see with what
uncommon transports of joy he saluted him; he first kifsed
him, then stroked his face, took him in his arms, laid him
under a shady tree, sat down by him, then looked as ear-
aiestly at him, as one would do at a picture, for a quarter of
an hour together. After this he would lie upon the ground,
stroke his legs and kiss them, then get up and stare at him,
as though he was bewitched; but the next day one could
not forbear laughter to see his behaviour; for he would walk
several hours with his father along the shore, leading him
by the hand, as though he was a lady: while, every now and
then, he would run to the boat to get something for him, as
a lump of sugar, dram, biscuit, or something or other that
was good. His frolics ran in another channel in the after-
noon; when he set old Friday on the ground, he would
dance round him, making comical postures and gestures;
and all this while would be telling him one story or another
of his travels and adventures.
It was on the ] Oth" of April, anna 1695, that I set my
foot upon the island a second time. When my faithful
Spaniard, accompanied by one more, approached the boat,
he little knew who I was, till I discovered myself to him.
"Seignior," said I, in Portuguese, "don't you know me?"
He spoke never a word, but giving his musket to his attend-
ant, extended his arms, and sajing something in Spanish
that I did not then understand, he came forward and em-
braced me, saying, he was inexcusable not to know his de-
liverer, who like an angel sent from heaven, had saved his
life. He then beckoned to the man to call out his com-
panions; asked me if I would walk to my own habitation,
and take possession, where I should find some mean im-
provements; but indeed they were extraordinary ones; for
they had planted so many trees so close together, that the
place was like a labyrinth, which none could find out ex-
cept themselves, who knew its intricate windings. I asked him the meaning of all these fortifications? he fold me he
would give a large account of what had pafsed since my
departure till this time, and how he had subdued some Eng.
lish, who thought to be their murderers, hoping I would
not be displeased, since necessity compelled them to it.—As I knew they were wicked villains, so I told him, that I
was not only far from finding fault with it, but was rather
heartily glad that they had subdued them. While we were
thus talking, the man whom he sent, returned, accompanied
by eleven more, but in such habits, that it was impossible to tell what nations they were of. He first turned to me,
and pointing to them, "These, Sir," said he, "are some of
the gentlemen who owe their lives to your goodness;" then
turning to them, and pointing to me, he made them sensi-
ble who I was; and then indeed they saluted me one by
one, not as ordinary men, but as though they had been am-
ba(sadors or noblemen, and 1 a triumphant conqueror; for
their behaviour not only agreed with a manlike, majestic
gravity, but at the same time was so obliging and courteous,
as made them agreeable to the last degree.
Before I relate the history of the transactions of my king-
dom, as I had it from the Spaniard's own mouth, 1 must
here insert what I omitted in my former relation. The
matter is this: just before we weighed anchor and set sail,
there happened a quarrel on board the ship, which had like to
have occasioned a second mutiny, till such time as the cou-
rageous captain, taking twoof the most refractory prisoners,
laid them in irons, threatening, as they were concerned in
the former disorders, to have them hanged in England for
running away with the ship. This frightened some of the
rest, as thinking the captain would serve them in the
same manner, though he seemed to give them good words
for the present. But the mate having intelligence of this,
made me acquainted with their fears; so that, to make
them more easy, and ourselves more safe from their conspi-
racies, I was obliged to go down, and pass my honour's
word for it, that upon their good behaviour, all that was
past should be forgiven; in testimony of which, I ordered
the two men's irons to be taken off, and themselves for-
given. But as this had brought us to an anchor at night,
in which there was a calm, the two men that had been in
irons, stole each of them a musket, and some other weapons,
and taking the ship's pinnace, not yet hauled up, ran away L .
to their brother rogues. The next morning we sent the long-boat, with men to pursue them, but all in vain; the
mate, in revenge, would have demolished my little castle,
burnt its furniture, and destroyed their plantations, but
having no orders for it, he did not put'it in execution.—And thus there were five Englishmen in the island, which
caused great differences, as my faithful Spaniard gavemea
perfect accountof, in the following manner:
"You cannot, Sir, but remember the embassy you sent
me about, and what a disappointment we met with, by your
absence, at our return. There is but little variety in the
relation of all our voyage, beijig blefsed with calm weather,
and a smooth sea. Great indeed was the joy of my coun-
trymen to see me alive, having acted as the principal man
on board, the captain of the shipwrecked vefsel dying before;
nor was their surprise less, as knowing I wastaken prisoner
by the savages of another nation, they had thought me long
since entombed in their monstrous bowels. But when I
showed them the arms, ammunition, and provisions I had
brought for them, they looked upon me as a second Joseph
advanced in Pharaoh's court, and immediately prepared to
come along with me. Indeed they were obliged to trespass upon their friendly savages, by borrowing two of their
canoes, under a pretext for fishing; and they came away the next morning, but without any provisions of their own,
except a few roots, which served them instead of bread.—After three weeks' absence, we arrived at our habitation.
Here we met with three English sailors, who, I confeP;,
gave us provisions, and that letter of direction you had left
for us, which informed us how to bring up tame goats, plant
corn, cure grapes, make pots, and, in short, every thing
that was necessary for our use. As, in particular, I knew
your method best, so taking Friday's father to assist me, we
managed all the affairs; nor were the rest of the Spaniards
wanting in their kind offices, dressing food for the English-
men, who did nothing but ramble and divert themselves in
the woods, either shooting parrots, or catching tortoises.
But we had not been long ashore, before we were informed
of two more Englishmen, naturally turned out of their com-
mon place of residence, by the three others above mention-
ed; this made my Spaniards and me (whom they now
looked upon as theirgovernor in your absence) endeavour to
persuade them to take them in,thatwemight be as one family; but all our entreaties were in vain, so that the poor fellows.
finding nothing to be done without industry, pitched their
tents on the north side of the island, a little inclining to the
west, for fear of savages. Here they built two huts, one to
lodge, and the other to lay their stores in; for my good natur-
ed Spaniard giving them some seeds, they dug and planted as I had done, and began to live prettily. But while they
were thus comfortably going on, the three unnatural brutes,
their countrymen, in a mere bullying humour, insulted them,
by saying, the governor, (meaning you) had given them a
pofsefsion of the island, and d—mn 'em they should build no
houses upon their ground, without paying rent. The two
honest men (for so let me now distinguish them)thought their
three countrymen only jested, and one of them invited them
in, to see their fine habitations; while the other facetiously
told them, that since they built tenements with great im-
provements, they should, according to the custom of lords,
give him a longer lease; at the same time desiring them to
tetch a scrivener to draw the writings. One of these
wretches swearing he should pay for the jest, snatches up a
fire-brand, and clapping it to the outside of their hut, very
fairly set it on fire, which would soon have consumed it,
had not the honest man thrust him away, and trod it out
with his feet. Hereupon the fellow returns with his pole,
with which he would have ended his days, had not the
poor man avoided the blow, when fetching his musket, he
knocked down the villain that began the quarrel. The
other two coming to assist their fellow, obliged the honest
man to take his musket also, and both of them presenting
their pieces, bid the villains stand off; and if they did not
lay down their arms, death should decide the dispute one
way or other. This brought them to a parley, in which
they agreed to take their wounded man and begone; but
they were in the wrong that they did not disarm them when
they had the power, and then make their complaint to me
and^my Spaniards for justice, which might have prevented
their farther designs against them. And, indeed, so many
trespafses did they afterwards commit, by treading down
their corn, shooting their young kids and goats, aud plagu-
ing them night and day, that they resolved to come to my
castle, challenge all the three, and decide their right by one
plain battle, while the Spaniards stood by to see fair play.
One day it happened, that two of my Spaniards (one of -whom understood English) being in the woods, were met
by one of the honest men, who complained how barbarous
their countrymen had been in destroying their corn, killing
their milk-goat, and three kids, which deprived them of their
subsistence; and tbat if we did not grant them relief, they
must be inevitably starved, and so they parted; but when
my Spaniards came home at night, and supper being on the
taWe, one of them began to reprehend the Englishmen, but
in a very mannerly way; which they resenting, replied,
"Whut businefs had their countrymen in that place without
leave, when it was none of their ground?" "Why," said
•Qy Spaniard, calmly, "laglise, they must not starve:" but
they replied, " Let them starve and be damn'd, they should
neither plant nor build; and damn them, they should be
their servants, and work tor them, for the island was theirs,
and they would burn all the huts they shpuld find in the
island." *4 By this rule," said my Spaniard, smiling,"' We
shall be your servants too-" "Aye, by G—d, and so you
shall," replied the impudent rascal. Upon which, starting
up, Will Atkins cries, "Come, Jack, let's have t'other
brush with them, who dare to build in our dominions?''—
Thus leaving us something heated with just pafsion, away
they trooped, every man having a gun, pistol, and sword,
muttering soti!e threatening words, that we could then but
imperfectly t. iderstand. That night they designed to mur-
der their two companions, and slept till midnight in the
bower, thihV:ng .to Tall upon them in their sleep; nor were
the honest men Iefs thoughtful concerning them; for at this
juncture thev v. ere coming to find them out, but in a much
fairer way. As soon as the villains came to the huts, and
found no body tin re> they concluded that I and my Spaniard
had given them notice, and therefore swore to be revenged
on us. Then they demolished the poor men's habitations;
not by fire as they attempted before, but pulled down their
houses limb from limb, not leaving stick or stone on the
ground where they stood, broke their household stuff in
pieces, tore up their trees, spoiled their inclosure, and, in
short, quite ruined them of every thing they had. Had
these people met together, no doubt but there would have
been a bloody battle; but Providence ordered it lor the
better; for just as the three were got together, the two
xvere at our castle; and when they left us, the three came
back again, but in great rage, scoffing!/ telling us what they had done; when one taking hold of a Spaniard's hat,
twirls it round, saying, "And you, Seignior Jack Spaniard,
shall have the same sauce, if you don't mend your manners."
My Spaniard, a grave but courageous man, knocked him
down with one blow of his tist; at which another villain
fired his pistol, and narrowly milled his body, but wounded
him a little in the ear. Hereat enraged, the Spaniard takes
up the fellow's musket whom he had knocked down, and would have shot him, if I and the rest had not com*: our,
and taken their arms from every one of them.
"These Englishmen perceiving they had made all of us
their enemies, began to cool; but notwithstanding their
bitter words, the Spaniards would not return them their arms again, telling them they would do them no manner of
harm, if they would live peaceably; but if they offered any injury to the plantation or castle, they would shoot them as
they would do ravenous beasts. This made them so mad,
that they went away raging like furies of hell. They were
no sooner gone, but in came the two honest men, fired with
the justest rage, if such can be, having been ruined as afore-
said. And indeed it was very hard, that nineteen of us
should be bullied by three villains, continually offending
with impunity."It was a great while, Sir, before we could persu..ide the
two Englishmen from pursuing, and undoubtedly killing
them with their fire-atms; but we promised them justice
should be done them; and, in the mean time, they should
reside with us in our habitation. In about five days after,
these three vagrants, almost starved with hunger, drew near
our grove, and perceiving me, the governor, and two others
walking by the side of the creek, they very submifsively
rit.sirud to be received into the family again. We told
them of their great incivility to us, and of their unnatural
barbarity to their countrymen; but yet we would see what
the rest agreed to, and in half an hour's time would bring
them word. Alter some debate, we called them in, where
their two countrymen laid a heavy charge against them,
for not only ruining, but designing to murder them, which
they could not deny. But here I was forced to interpose
as a mediator, by obliging the two Englishmen not to hurt
them, being naked and unarmed; and that the other three
should make them restitution, by building their two huts,
f62 LifK AKD AOVEVTVR«i
«rd fencHig their ground in the same manner as it was be-
fore. Well, being in a miserable condition, they submitted
to this at present, and lived some time regularly enough,
except as to the working part, which they did not care for,
but the Spaniards would have dispensed with that, had they continued easy and quiet. Their arms being given them
again, they scarce had them a week when they became as
troublesome as ever; but an accident happening soon after,
obliged us to lay aside private resentments, and look to our
common preservation.
"One night, Sir, I went to bed, perfectly well in health,
and yet by no means could I compose myself to sleep; upon
which, being very uneasy, 1 got up and looked out, but it
being dark, I could perceive nothing but the trees around
.the castle. I went to bed again, but it was all one, I could
riot sleep; when one of my Spaniards hearing me walk
about, asked who was up; I answered, " It is I." When
I told him the occasion, "Sir," said he, ** such things are not to be slighted; for certainly there is some mischiefplot-
ting ngtfinst us." "Where pro. the Englishmen;'' said I. He answered, "In their hutsj for they lay separate from
us, Sir, since the last mutiny," Well," said I, "some
kind spirit gives this information for advantage, Come let
us go abroad, and see if any thing offers tojustify our fear*,'*
Upon which 1 and some of my Spaniards went up the moun-
tain, not by the ladder, but through the grove, and then we
were struck wiih a panic fear on seeing a light, as though
it were a fire, at a very little distance, and hearing the voices of several men. Hereupon we retreated immediate"
Iv, and raised the rest of our forces, and made them sensible
of the impending danger j but with all my authority, I could
not make them stay where they were, so earnest were they
to see how thing? went• Indeed, the darkness of the night
gave them opportunity enough to view them by the light of
the fire, undiscovered, As they were in different parties,
end straggling over the shore, we were much afraid that
they should find out our habitations, and destroy eur flocks
of goat* j to prevent which, we sent immediately an Eng,
liflnrpii isiid two Spaniards to drive the goats into the vaV
lt•y where the cave lay i or, if there was occasion, into the
cave iuelf: AS to onr.elve*, resuming our native courage
prudent conduct, had we not been divided, we duitt
iu.e to attack a hundred of them { but before it WM
'fy light, We resolved to send out Friday's fattier as a.spy,
who immediately stripping himself naked, gets among them
undiscovered, and in two hour's time brings word, that they
were two parties of two different nations, who lately having
fc bloody battle with one another, happened to land by mere
chance in the same island, to devour their miserable pri-,

appeared, there would be a terrible engagement. Old Fri-
day had scarce ended his relation, when we heard an un.
eeffimun neise, and .perceived that there was a horrid en-
gagement between the two armies,
i' 8tt«h was the curiosity of our party, especially the Eng-
lishmen, that they wotild not lie close, tho' Old Friday told
them their saiely" depended upon it j and that if we had
patience, we should behold the savages kill one another.
However they used some caution, by going farther into
the woods, and placing themselves in a convenient place to behold the battle,
MNever could there be a more bloody engagement, or
went)? more invincible spirits and prudent conduct, ac-
cording to their manner and way of fighting. It lasted near
two hours, till the party which was nearest our castle began
to decline, and at last to fly from their conquerors. We
were undoubtedly put into a great consternation on this
account, lest they should run into our grove, and conse-
quently bring us into the like danger. Hereupon we re-
solved to kill the first that came, to prevent discovery, and
that too with our swords, and the butt end of our muskets,
tor fear the report of our guns should be heard.
"And so indeed, as we thought, it happened; for three of the vanquished army crossing the creek, ran directly to
the place, as to a thick wood for shelter; nor was it long
before our scout gave us notice of it; as also that, the vic-
tors did not think tit to pursue them. Upon this I would
not suffer them to be slain, but had them surprised and taken
by our party; afterwards they proved very good servants
to us, being stout young creatures, and able to do a great
deal of work. The remainder of the conquered savages
tied to their canoes, and put out into the ocean, while the
conquerors, joining together, shouted by way of triumph, O '.»
and about three in the afternoon they also embarked for
their own country. Thus we were freed at once from those
savages and our fears, not perceiving any of these creatures
for some considerable time after. We found two and thirty
men dead in the field of battle; some were slain with long
arrows, which we found sticking in their bodies; and the
rest were killed with great unweildy wooden swords, which
denoted their vast strength, and of which we found seven-
teen, besides bows and arrows: but we could not find one
wounded creature among them alive; for they either kill
their enemies quite,or carry those wounded away with them.
"This terrible sight tamed the Englishmen for some time,
considering how unfortunate thev might have been had they
fallen into their hands, who would not only kill them a?
enemies, but also for food, as we do cattle: and indeed so
much did this nauseate their stomachs, that it not only made
them very sick, but more tractable to the common necefsary
husinefs of the whole society, planting, sowing, and reap-
ing, with the greatest sign's of amity and friendship; so,
that being now all good friends, we began to consider of
circumstances in general; and the first thing we thought
of was, whether, as we perceived the savages haunted that
side of the island, and there being more retired parts of it,
and yet as well suited to our manner of living, and equally
to our advantage, we ought not rather to move our place
of residence, and plant it in a much safer place, both for
the security of our corn and cattle.
"After a lor.g deb:ite on this head, it was resolved, or
rather voted, nemine cmtradicente, not to remove our ancient
castle, and that for this very good reason, that some time
or other we expected to hear from our supreme governor,
(meaning you, Sir.) whose messengers not finding us there,
might think the place demolished, and all his subjects de-
stroyed by the savages.
"As to the next concern relating to our corn and cattle,
we consented to have them removed to the valley where
the cave was, that being most proper and sufficient for both.
Hut yet, when we considered farther, we altered one part
of our resolution, which was to remove part of our cattle
thither, and plant only part of our corn there; so that in
case one part was destroyed, the other might be preserved.
Another resolution we took, which really had a great deal
of prudence in it, and that was, in not trusting the three savages whom we had taken prisoners, with any knowledge
of the plantations we had made in the valley, of what num-
ber of cattle we had there, much less of the cave, wherein
we kept several arms, and two barrels of powder you left
for us at your departure from this island. But though we
could not change our habitation, we resolved to make it
more fortified and more secure. To this end, Sir, as you
planted trees at some distance before the entrance of your
palace; so we, imitating your example, planted and filled
up the whole space of ground, even to the banks of the
creek, nay, into the very ooze where the tide flowed, not
leaving a place for landing; and among those I had planted,
they had intermingled so many short ones, all of which
growing wonderfully fast and thick, a little dog could
scarcely find a passage through them. Nor was this suffi-
cient, as we thought, for we did the same to all the ground,
on the right and left hand of us, even to the top of the hill,
without so much as leaving a passage for ourselves, except
by the ladder, which being taken down, nothing but what had wings or witchcraft could pretend to come near us.
And indeed this was exceedingly well contrived, especially
to serve that occasion, for which we afterwards found it.
necefsary.
"Thus we lived two years in a happy retirement, hav-
ing, all this time, not one visit from the savages. Indeed
one morning we had an alarm, which put us in some amaze-
ment; for a few of my Spaniards being out very early,
perceived no less than twenty canoes, as it were, coming
on shore: upon which returning home with great precipi-
tation, they gave us the alarm, which obliged us to keep
at home all that day and the next, going out only in the
night-time to make our observations; but, as good luck
would have it, they were upon another design, and did not land that time upon the island.
"But now there happened another quarrel between the
three wicked Englishmen, and some of my Spaniards.—
The occasion was this: One of them being enraged at one
of the savages, whom he had taken prisoner, lor not being
able to comprehend something which he was showing him, snatched up a hatchet in a great fury, not to correct, but to
kill him; yet mifsing his head, gave him such a barbarous
cut in the shoulder, that he had like to have struck. $ff his
03
arm; at which one of my good-natured Spaniards toter-
po'.ing between the Englishman and the savage, beseechedthe former not to murder the poor creature; but this kind-
ue fs had like to have cost the Spaniard his life, for the
Englishman struck at him in the same manner; which he
nimbi)' and wisely avoided, returned suddenly upon him
with his shovel, (being all at workabout their corn land) and
very fairly knocked the brutish creature down. Hereupon,
another Englishman coming to his fellow's afsistance, laid the
good Spaniard on the earth; when immediately two others
coming to his relief, were attacked by the third Englishman,
armed with an old cutlass, who wounded them both. This
uproar soon reached our ears, when, we rushing out upon
them, took the three Englishmen prisoners, and then our next
question was, what should be done to such mutinous and
i'mpudent fellows, so furious, desperate, and idle, that they
were mischievous to the highest degree, and consequently
not safe for the society to let them live among them.
"Now, Sir, as I was governor in your absence, so I also
took the authority of a judge: and, having them brought
before me, I told them, that if they had been of my country,
I would have hanged every mother's son of them; but,
since it was an Englishman, (meaning you, kind Sir,) to
whom we were indebted for our preservation and deliver-
ance, I would, in gratitude, use them with all pofiible mild-
jiefs; but, at the same time, leave them to the judgment of
the other two Englishmen, who, I hoped, forgetting their
resentments, would deal impartially by them.
"Hereupon one of his countrymen stood up: "Sir,"
said he, "leave it not to us, for you may be sensible we
have reason to sentence them to the gallows: besides, Sir,
this fellow, Will Atkins, and the two others, proposed to us,
that we might murder you all in your sleep, which we could
not consent to: but knowing their inability, and your vigi-
lance, we did not think fit to discover it before now."
"Now, Seignior," said I, "do you hear what is alleged
against your What can you say to justify so horrid an action
as to murder us in cold blood?" So far, Sir, was the wretch
from denying it, that he swore, d—mn him but he would do
it still. "But what have we done to jou, Signior Atkins,"
said I; "or what will you gain by killing us? what shall
we do to prevent your Must we kill you, or you kill us?
why will you, Signior Atkins," said I, smiling, "put us to such an unhappy dilemma, such a fatal necefsity?" But so
great a rage did my scoffing and yet severe jest, put him
into, that he was going to fly at me, and undoubtedly had
attempted to kill me if he had been pofsefsed of weapons,
and had not been prevented by three Spaniards. This un-
paralleled and villanous carriage, made us seriously consider
what was to be done. The two Englishmen and the Spa-
niard, who had saved the poor Indian's life, mightily peti-
tioned me to hang one of them for an example to the others,
which should be him that had twice attempted to commit
murder with his hatchet, it being at that time thought im-
pofsible the poor slave should recover. But they could
never gain my consent to put him to death, for the reasons
above-mentioned, since it was an Englishman (even your-
self) who was my deliverer; and as merciful counsels are
most prevailing when earnestly prefsed, so I got them to be
of the same opinion as to clemency. But to prevent them
doing us any farther mischief, we all agreed, that they should
have no weapons, as sword, gun, powder, or shot, but be
expelled from the society, to live as they pleased by them-
selves; that neither the two Englishmen, nor the rest of the Spaniards, should have conversation with them upon any ac-
count whatsoever; that they should be kept from coming
within a certain distance of our castle; and if they dared
to offer us any violence, either by spoiling, burning, killing,
or destroying any of the corn, plantings, buildings, fences,
or cattle, belonging to the society, we would shoot them as
freely as we would do beasts of prey, in whatsoever places
we should find them.
"This sentence seemed very just to all but themselves;
when, like a merciful judge, I called out to the two honest
Englishmen, saying, " You must consider they ought not to
^ie starved,neither; and since it will be some time before they
can raise corn and cattle of their own, let us give them soma
corn to last them eight months, and for seed to sow, by which
time they'll raise some for themselves; let us also bestow
upon them six milch goats, four he ones, and six kids, as
well for their present support, as for a further increase:
with tools necessary for their work, as hatchets, an axe, saw,
and other things convenient to build them huts: all which
\vere agreed: but before they took them into pofsefsion, I
obliged them solemnly to swear, never to attempt anything
against us, or their countrymen, for the future. Thus dis-
{68 IIPI AMD ADVE9XUEX£
mifsing them from our society, they went away, sullen and
refractory, as though neither willing to go nor stay; how-
ever seeing no remedy, they took what provision was given
them, proposing to choose a convenient place where the/
fliight live by themselves.
"About five days after, they came to those limits appoint-
ed, in order for more victuals, and sent me word by one of
my Spaniards, whom they called to, where they had pitched
their tents, and marked themselves out a habitation and
plantation, at the N. E. and most remote part of the island.
And, indeed, there they built themselves two very handsome
cottages, resembling our little castle, being under the side of
a mountain, with some trees already growing on three sides
of it; so that planting a few more, it would be obscured from
sight, unless particularly soughLfor. When these huts were
finished, we gave them some dry goat-skins for bedding and
covering; and upon their giving us fuller afsurances oi their
good behaviour for the future, we gave them some peas, bar-
ley, and rice for sowing, and whatever tools we could spare.
"Six months did'they live in this separate condition, in
which they got their first harvest in, the quantity of which
was but small, because they had planted but little land; for,
indeed, all their plantations being to form, made it more
difficult, especially as it was a thing out of their element; and when they were obliged to make their boards and pots,
&c. they could make little or nothing of it. But the rainy
season coming on, put them into a greater perplexity, for
want of a cave to keep their corn dry, and prevent it from
spoiling: and so much did this humble them, that they beg-
ged of my Spaniards to help them, to which the good-natured
men readily consented, and in four days space, worked a
great hole in the side of the hill for them, large enough for
their purpose, to secure their corn and other things from the
rain, though not comparable to ours, which had several ad-
ciitiona! apartments.
"But a new whim possessed these rogues about three
quarters of a year after, which had like to have ruined us,
and themselves too; for it seems, being tired and weary of
this sort of living, which made them work for themselves, without hopes of changing their condition, nothing would
serve them, but that they would make a voyage to the continent, and try if they could seize upon some of the savages,
and bring them over as s'aves, to do their drudgery, while they lived at ease and pltasure. ^
Indeed the project was not so preposterous, if they had
not gone farther; but they neither did, nor proposed any
thing, but what had mischief in the design, or the event.—One morning, these three fellows came down to the limited
station, and humbly desired to be admitted to talk with us,
which we readily granted; they told us, in short, that be-
ing tired of their manner of living, and the labour ot their
hands in such employments, not being sufficient to procure
the necefsaries of life, they only desired one of ihe canots
we came over in, with some arms and ammunition for their
defence, and they would seek their fortunes abroad, and
never trouble us any more. To be sure, we were glad
enough to get rid of such wretched plagues; but yet
honesty made us ingenuously represent to them, by what
we ourselves hadsufTered, the certain destruction they were
running into, either of being starved to death or murdered
by the savages. To this they very audaciously replied,
that they neither could nor would work; and consequently
that they might as well be starved abroad as at home;
and as to their falling into the hands of the savages, why, if
they were murdered, that was nothing to us, there was an
end of them: neither had they any wives or children to cry
after them: nay, so intent were they upon their voyage, that
if the Spaniards had not given them arms, so they had but
the canoe they would have gone without them.
"Though we could not well spare our fire-arms, rather
than they should go like naked men, we let them have two
muskets, a pistol, a cutlass, and three hatchets, which were
thought very sufficient; we gave them also goats' flesh, a
great basket full of dried grapes, a pot of tresh butter, a
young live kid, and a large canoe sufficient to carry twenty men. And thus, with a mast made of a long pole, and a
sail of six large goat-skins dried, having a fair breeze, and
flood-tide with them, they merrily sailed away, the Spa-
niards calling after them, Bon vejajo, no man ever expecting
to see them more."When they were gone, the Spaniards and Englishmen
would often say to one another, "O how peaceably do we
now live, since those turbulent fellows iiave left us!"—
Notffing could be farther from their thoughts than to behold
their faces any more; and yet scarce two and twenty days
had palscd over their heads, but one of the Englishmen, be-
ing abroad a planting, perceived, at a distance, three men,

where or other, they put over to one of the western islands(
Pere they found the natives very courteous to them, giving
them several roots and dried fishf nay, even their women
too were willing to supply them with what they could
procure them to eat, bringing it a great way to them upon
their heads. Among those hospitable Indians they con-
tinued some days, inquiring, by signs and tokens, what na-
tions lay around them; and were informed, that there were
»everal fierce and terrible people lived every way, accus-
tomed to eat mankind; but for themselves they never used
such diet, except those that were taken in battle, |^$.<f
them they made a solemn feast.
"The Englishmen inquired how long it was since they
had a feast of that kind; They answered, about tw» o:to: •
*a°i"pointing to the moon; and then two fingersj that,
at this time, their king had two hundred prisoners, which
were fattening up for the slaughter. The Englishmen

were a, good as their word j for by that time they brought

bullets ; things which, tho* they were wholly ignorant of,
yet they seemed entirely contented with; ana dragging the
poor wretches into the boat, with their hands bound behind
them, delivered them to the Englishmen. 8«t this obliged
them to put off as soon as they had these presents, lest the
donors should have expected two or three of them to be
killed, and to be invited to dinner the next day; and «Q
taking leave with all possible respect and thanks, though
neither of them understood what the others said, they sailed
away back to the Just island, and there set eight of the
prisoners at liberty. In their voyage they endeavoured ta
t-'omjbrt, and have some conversation with the poor cap*
tivesj but it was impossible to make them sensible of any
thing j and nothing they could say or give, or do for thenif

unbound only to be devoured: if they gave them any

j|?.«gbterj or looked at any one more particularly, the
poor creature supposed itself to be the first sacrifices and
even when we brought them to our island, and began to use them with the greatest humanity and kindness, yet they
expected every day that their new roasters wpula devour
them,
« And thus, Sir, did these three strange wanderers con.
slwcie their unaccountable relation of their vovuge, which
ti
was both amazing and entertaining. Hereupon, I asked them, where their new family was f They told me, they had
put them into one of their huts, and they came to beg some
victuals for them. This, indeed, made us all long to see
them; and taking Friday's father with us, leaving only two
at our castle, we came down to behold these poor creatures.
"When we arrived at the hut, (they being bound again
by the Englishmen, for fear of escaping) we found them
stark naked, expecting their fatal tragedy: they were
three lusty men, well shaped, with straight and good limbs,
between thirty and five and thirty years old; and five wo-
men, two of them might be from thirty to forty, two more
not above four andtwenty; and the last, a comely tall
maiden of about seventeen. Indeed, all the women were
very agreeable, both in proportion and features, except
that they were tawny, which their modest behaviour, and
other graces, made amends for, when they afterwards
came to be clothed.
"This naked appearance, together with their miserable
circumstances, was no very comfortable sight to my Spa-
niards, who, for their parts, I may venture, Sir, without
flatterv, to say, are men of the best behaviour, calmest
tempers, and sweetest nature, that can possibly be; for
they immediately ordered Friday's father to see if he knew
any of them, or if he understood what they could say.
No sooner did the old Indian appear, but he looked at
them with great seriousness; yet as they were not of his
nation, they were utter strangers to him, and none could
understaud'his speech or signs, but one woman. This was
enough to answer his design, which was to assure them
they would not be killed, being fallen into the hands of
Christians, who abhorred such barbarity. When they
were fully satisfied of this, they expressed their joy by such
strange gestures, and uncommon tones, as it is not possible for me to describe. But the woman, their interpreter, was
ordered next to inquire, whether they were content to be
servants, and would work for the men who had brought
them hither to save their lives? hereupon, (being at this
time unbound) they fella capering and dancing, one taking
this thing upon her shoulders, and the others that, intimat-
ing, that they were.willing to do any thing for them. But
iiow, Sir, having women amongst us, and dreading that
it might occasion some strife, if not blood, I asked lh« tlwte
men what they would do, and how they intended to use
these creatures, whether as servantsor women r Oneol them
very pertly and readily answered, they would use them as
both. Gentlemen, said I, as you are your own masters, I
am not going to restrain you from that; but, methiuks, lor
avoiding dissensions among you, I would only desire you to
engage, that none of you will take more than one fora wo-
man or wife, and that having taken this one, none else should
presume to touch her; for though we have not a priestly
authority to marry you, yet it is but reasonable, that who-
ever thus takes a woman, should be obliged to maintain her,
since nobody has any thing to do with her; and this, in-
deed,appeared so just to all present, that.it was unanimously
agreed to. The Englishmen then asked my Spaniards, whe-
ther they designed to take any of them? but they all an-
swered, No; some declaring they had already wives in
Spain; and others that they cared not to join with infidels.
On the reverse, the Englishmen took each of them a tem-
porary \vile, and so set up a new method of living. As to
Friday's father, the Spaniards, and the three savage servants
we had taken in the late battle, they all lived with me in
our ancient castle ; and indeed we supplied the main part
of the island with food, as necessity required. But the most
remarkable part of the story is, how these Englishmen, who
had been so much at variance, should agree about the choice
of those women; yet they took a way good enough to pre-
vent quarrelling among themselves. They set the five wo-
men in one of their huts, and going themselves to the other,
drew lots which should have the first choice. Now, he
that had the first lot went to the hut, and fetched out her -
lie chose; and it is remarkable, that he took her that was
the most homely and eldest of the number, which made the
rest of the Englishmen exceedingly merry; the Spaniards
themselves could not but smile'at it; but, as it happened,
the fellow had the best thought, in choosing one fit for ap-
plication and business; and, indeed, she proved the best
wife of all the parcel.
But when the poor creatures perceived themselves placed
in a row, and separated one by one, they were again seized
with an unspeakable terror, as now thinking they were going
to be slain in earnest; and when the Englishman came to
take the first, the rest set up a lamentable cry, clasped their
arms round her neck, and hanging about her, took their
1ast farewell, as they thought, in such trembling agonie<,
ai.d affectionate embraces, as would have softened the hard-
est heart in the world, and made the driest eyes melt into
tears; nor could they be persuaded but that they were going
to die, till such time as Friday's father made them sensible
that the Englishmen had chosen them for their wives, which
ended all their terror and concern upon this occasion.
"Well, after this, the Englishmen, went to work, and, be-
ing assisted by my good-natured Spaniards, in a few hours
they erected every one of them a new hut or tent for their
separate lodging, since those they had already were filled
vi ith tools, household stuff, and provision. They all con-
tinued on the north shore of the island, but separate as be-
for«; the three wicked ones pitched farther off, and the two
honest men nearer our castle; so that the island seemed to
be peopled in three places, three towns beginning to be built
for that purpose. And here I cannot but remark, what is
very common, that the two honest men had the worst wives,
(I mean as to industry, cleanlinefs, and ingenuity) while the
three reprobates enjoyed women of contrary qualities.
"But another observation I made was, in favour of the
two honest men, to show what disparity there is between a
diligent application to business, on the one hand, and a sloth-
ful, negligent, and idle temper, on the other. Both of
them had the same parcel of ground laid out, and corn to
sow sufficient for them; but both did not make the same
improvements, either in their cultivation or their planting.
The two honest men had a multitude of young trees planted
about their habitations, so that when you approached near
them, nothing appeared but a wood, very pleasing and de-
ligh f il. Every thing they did prospered and flourished;
their grapes planted in order, seemed as though managed in a vii e»ard, and were infinitely preferable to any of the others.
Nor were they wanting to find out a place of retreat, but
dug a cave in the most retired part of a thick wood, to se-
cure their wives and children, with their provision and chief-
tisi goods, surrounded with innumerable stakes, and having
a iro-tsub e entrance, in case any mischief should happen,
either from their fellow country men, or the devouring savages.
"As to the reprobates, (though I must own Uiey were
much more civilized than before) instead of adelightful wood
surrounding their dwellings, we found the words of Jung
Solomon too truly verified; "I went by the vineyard of the
"slothful, and it was all overgrown with thorns." In many
places their crop was obscured by weeds; the hedges having
several gaps in them, the wild goats had got in, and eaten up the corn, and here and there was a dead bush to stop
these gaps for the present, which was no more than shutting
the stable door after the steed was stolen away. But as to
their wives, they (as I observed before) were more diligent,
and cleanly enough, especially in their victuals, being in-
structed by one of the honest men, who had been a cook's
mate on board a ship: and very well it was so; for as he
cooked himself, his companion and their families lived as well as the idle husbands, who did nothing but loiter about,
.fetch turtle's eggs,catch fish and birds, and do any thing but
work, and lived accordingly; while the diligent lived very
handsomely and plentifully, in the most comfortable manner.
"And now, Sir, I come to lay before your eyes a scene
quite different from any thing that ever happened to us be-
fore, and perhaps ever befel you in all the time of your
residence on this island.' 1 shall inform you of its original
in the following manner: .
"One morning, Sir, very early, there came five or six
canoes of Indians on shore, indisputably upon their old cus-
tom of devouring their prisoners. All that we had to do
upon such an occasion, was to lie concealed, that they, not
having any notice of inhabitants, might depart quietly, after
performing their bloody execution: whoever first discovered
the savages, was to give notice to all the three plantations
to keep within doors, and then a proper scout was to be
placed to give intelligence of their departure. But, not-
withstanding these wise measures, an unhappy disaster dis-
covered us to the savages, which was like to have caused
the desolation of the whole island; for, after the savages
were gone off in their canoes, some of my Spaniards and I
looking abroad, and being inflamed w'uh. a curiosity to see
what they had been doing, to our great amazement beheld
three savages fast asleep on the ground, who, either being
gorged, could not awake when the others went off, or having
wandered too far into the woods, did not come back in time.
"What to do with them at first, we could not tell; as for
slaves we had enough of them already; and as to killing
them, neither Christianity nor humanity would sufler Hi to

shed the blood of persons who never did us wrong. We
perceived they had no boat left them to transport them to
their own nation; and that, by letting them wander about,
they might discover us, and inform ihe first savages that
should happen to land upon the same bloody occasion, which
information might entirely ruin us: and therefore I coun-
selled my Spaniards to secure them, and set them about some
work or other, till we could better dispose of them.
"Hereupon we all went back, and making them awake, took them prisoners. It is impossible to cxprcfs the horror
they were in, especially when bound, as thinking they were going to be murdered and eaten, but we soon cased them of
their fear as to that point. We first took them to the bower,
where the chief of our country'work lay, as keeping
planting corn, &c. and then carried them to the
lishmen's habitation, to help them in their bnsi
happy it was for us all we did not carry them to ousstle,
as by the sequel will appear. The Englishm
found them work to do; but whether they did not guard
them strictly, or that they thought they could not better them-
selves, I cannot tell; but certainly one of them ran away into
the woods, and t hey coulcl not hear of him for a long time after.
"Undoubtedly there was reason enough to suppose he got
home in some of the canoes, the savages returning in about
four weeks time, and going off in the space of two days. You may be certain, Sir, this thought could not but terrify
us exceedingly, and make us justly conclude, that the savage
would inform his countrymen of our abode in the island,
how few and weak we were in comparison to their numbers;
and we expected it would not be long before the English-
men would be attacked in their habitations: but the savages
had not seen their places of safety in the woods, nor our
• 'astfe, which it was a great happiness they did not know.
"Nor were we mistaken in our thoughts upon this oc-
casion; for about eight months after this, six canoes, with about ten men in each canoe, came sailing by the north-side
of Iheisland, which they were never accustomed to do'belore',
and landed about an hour after sunrise, near a mile from the
dwelling of the two Englishmen, who, it seems, had trw
good fortune to discover them about a league off: so that it
was an hour before they could attain the shore, and some
time longer before they could come at them. And now being comirwed in this opinion that they were certainly betrayed, they immediately bound the two slaves which were
left, causing two of the three men, whom they brought with the women, and who proved very faithful, to lead them with
their wives, and other conveniences, into their retired cave
in the wood,and there to bind the two fellows hand and
foot, till they had further orders. They then opened their
fences, where they kept their milch goats, and drove them
all out, giving the goats liberty to ramble in the woods, to
make the savages believe that they were wild ones; but the
slave had given a truer information, which made them come
to the very inclosures. The two frightened men sent the
other slave of the three, who had been with them by acci-
dent, to alarm the Spaniards, and desire their assistance; in
the mean time they took their arms and ammunition, and
made to the cave where they had sent their wives, and se-
curing their slaves, seated themselves in a private place, from whence they might behold all the actions of'the savages.
Nor had they gone far, when, ascending a rising ground,
they.could see a little army of Indians approach to their
beautiful dwelling, and in a few moments more, perceive
the same, and their furniture, to their unspeakable grief, burning in a consuming flame: and when this was done,
they spread here and there, searching every bush and place
for the people, of whom it was evident they had information.
Upon which the two Englishmen, not thinking themselves
secure where they stood, retreated about half a mile higher
in the country, rightly concluding, that the farther the
savages strolled, there would be less numbers together: upon
which they next took their stand by the trunk of an old tree,
very hollow and large, whence they resolved to see what
would offer; but they had not stood long there, before two
savages came running directly towards them, as though having knowledge of their being there, who seemed resolved
to attack them; a little farther were three more, and five
more behind them again, all running the same way. It
cannot be imagined the perplexity the poor men were in at
this sight, thinking that if afsistance did not speedily come,
their cave in the wood would be discovered, and consequentlv .
all therein lost; so they resolved'to resist them there, and,
when overpowered, to ascend to the top of the 'trees, where
they might defend themselves as long as their ammunition
lasted, and sell their lives as dear as pofsible to those
P3
devouring savages. Thus fixfid in their resolution, they
next considered, whether they should fire at the first two, or
wait for the three, and so take the middle party, by which
the two first and the five last would be separated. In this
regulation the two savages also confirmed them, by turning
a little to another part of the wood; but the three, and the
five alter them, came directly towards the tree. Hereupon
they resolved to take them in a direct line, as they approach-
ed nearer, because, perhaps, the first shot might hit them all
three; and upon this occasion, the man who was to fire,
charged his piece with three or four bullets. And thus
while they were waiting, the savages came on, one of them
was the runaway, who had caused all the mischief: so they
resolved he should not escape, if they both fired at once.
But, however, though they did not fire together, they were
ready charged; when the first that let fly, was too good a
marksman to miss his aim; for he killed the foremost out-
-right, the second (who was the runaway Indian) fell to the
ground, being shot through the body, but not dead, and the
third was a little wounded in the shoulder, who, sitting
down on the ground, fell a screaming in a most fearful man-
ner. The noise of the guns, which not only made the most
resounding echoes, from one side to the other, but raised
the birds of all sorts, fluttering with the most confused noise,
so much terrified the five savages behind, that they stood
still at first, like so many inanimate images. But when all
things were in profound silence, they came to the place where
their companions lay; and here, not being sensible that
they were liable to the same late, stood over the wounded
man, undoubtedly inquiring the occasion of this calamity;
and'tis as reasonable to suppose, he told them,that it came
by thunder and lightning from the gods, having never seen
or heard of a gun before, in the whole course of their lives.
By this time the Englishmen, having loaded their pieces,
iired both together a second time, when seeing them all fall
immediately on the ground, they thought they had killed
every creature of them. This made them come up boldly
before they had charged their guns, which, indeed, was a
wrong step; for, when they came to the place, they found
four alive, two of them very little wounded, and one not at
all, which obliged them to fall upon them with their muskets;
they first knocked the runaway savage on the head, and another that was but little wounded in the arm, and then 
put the other languishing wretches out of their pain; while
he that was not hurt, with bended knees and uplift hands, made piteous moans and signs to them to spare his life;
nor, indeed, were they unmerciful to the poor wretch, but
pointing to him to sit down at the foot of a tree hard by: and
then, one of the Englishmen, with a piece of rope twine he
had in his pocket, by mere chance, tying his feet fast to-
gether, and his two hands behind him, they left him there,
making all the haste they could after the othertwo, fearing
they should find out their cave; but though they could not
overtake them, they had the satisfaction to perceive them
at a distance cross a valley, towards the sea, a quite con-
trary way to their retreat; upon which they returned to the
tree, to look after their prisoner; but when they came there
he was gone, leaving the piece of rope-yarn, wherewith he
was bound, behind him.
"Well, now they were as much concerned as ever,-as
not knowing how near their enemies might be, or in what
numbers. Immediately they repaired to the cave, to see it'
.all was well there, and found every thing safe, except the
women, who were frightened upon their husbands' account,
whom they now loved entirely. They had not been long
here, before seven of my Spaniards came to assist them;
while the other ten, their servants, and Friday's father, were
gone to defend their bower, corn, and cattle, in case the
savages should have rambled so far. There accompanied
the seven Spaniards, one of the three savages that had for-
merly been taken prisoner; and with them also that very
Indian whom the Englishmen had, a little before, left under
the tree; for it seems, they passed by that way where the
slaughter was made, and so carried along with them that
poor wretch that was left bound. But so many prisoners
now becoming a burden to us, and fearing the dreadful
consequence of their escaping, most of the Spaniards and
English urged the absolute nectfsity there was of killing
them for our common preservation; but, Sir, the authority
I bore, as governor, over-ruled that piece of cruelty; and
- then I ordered them to be sent prisoners to the old cave in
the valley, bound hands and feet, with two Spaniards to
guard them.
^ "So much encouraged were the Englishmen at the ap-
'proach of the Spaniards, andso great were their fury against the savages for destroying their habitations, that thev had
not patience to stay any longer; but, taking five Spaniards
along with them, armed with four muskets, a pistol, and a
quarter-staff, away they went in pursuit of their enemies.
As they passed by the place where the savages were slain,
it was very easy to be perceived that more of them had
been there, having attempted to carry off their dead bodies,
but found it impracticable. From a rising ground, our party
had the mortification to see the smoke that proceeded from
the ruins; when coming farther in sight of the shore, they
plainly perceived that the savages had embarked in their
canoes, and were putting out to sea. This they were very
sorry for, there being no coming at them to give them a
parting salute; but, however, they were glad enough to
get clear of such unwelcome guests.
"Thus the two honest, but unfortunate Englishmen, be-
ing ruined a second time, and their improvements quite de-
stroyed, most of my good-natured Spaniards helped them to rebuild, and we all assisted them with needful supplies; nay,
what is more remarkable, their three mischievous country-
men, when they heard of it, (which was after all these disasters
were over, they living more remote eastward) very friendly
sympathized with them, and worked for them several days;
so that in all ttle their habitations were rebuilt, their necefsities -
supplied, and themselves restored to their former tranquillity.
"Though the savages had nothing to boast of in this ad-
venture, (several canoes being driven ashore, followed by
two drowned creatures, having undoubtedly met with a storm at sea, that very night they departed) yet it was natural
to be supposed, that those whose better fortune it was to
attain their native shore, would inflame their nation to
another ruinous attempt, with a greater force to carry all
before them. And, indeed, so it happened: for about seven
months after, our island was invaded with a most formidable
navy, no less than eight andtwenty canoes full of savages, armed with wooden swords, monstrous clubs, bows and
arrows, and such like instruments of war, landing at the
east-end of the island.
"You may well, Sir, imagine, what consternation our
men were in upon this account, and how speedy they were
to execute their resolution, having only that night's time
allowed them. They knew, that since they could not with-
stand their enemies, concealment was the only way to pro-
cure their safety; and, therefore, they took down the huts that were built for the two Englishmen, and drove their
flock of goats, together with their own at the bower, to the
old cave in the valley, leaving as little appearance of in-
habitants as possible; and then posted themselves, with all
their force, at the plantation of the two men. As they ex-
pected, so it happened; for early the next morning, the
Indians, leaving their canoes at the east-end of the island,
came running alongthe shore, about two hundred and fifty
in number, as near as could be'guefsed. Our army was but
little indeed; and what was our greatest misfortune, we had
not arms sufficient for them. The account, as to the men,
Sir, isas follows: viz. 17 Spaniards, .5 Knelishmen, old Fri-
day, the three savages, taken with the five women, who
proved faithful servants, and three other slaves, living with
the Spaniards. To arm these, they had 11 muskets, 5 pis-
tols, 3 fowling-pieces, 2 swords, 3 old halberts, 5 muskets,
or fowling-pieces, taken from the sailors whom you reduced.
As to the slaves, we gave three of them halberts, and the
other, three long staves, with great iron spikes at the end
of them, with hatchets by their sides; we also had hatchets
sticking in our girdles, besides the fire arms; nay, two of
the women, inspired with Amazonian fortitude, could not
bo difiuadcd from fighting along with their dear husbands, and if they died, to die with them. Seeing their resolution,
we gave them hatchets likewise; but what pleased them best, were the bows and arrows (which they dexterously
knew how to use) that the Indians had left behind them,
after their memorable battle one against another.
"Over this army, which, though little, was of great in-
trepiditv, I was constituted chief general and commander;
and knowing Will Atkins, though exceedingly wicked, yet
a man of invincible courage, I gave him the power of com-
manding under me; he had six men with their muskets
loaded with six or seven bullets a piece, and were planted
just behind a small thicket of bushes, as an advanced guard,
having orders to let the first pafs by; and then, when he
lired into the middle of them, make a nimble retreat round
a part of the wood, and so come in the rear of the Spaniards,
who were shaded by a thicket of.trees: for, though the sa-
.vages came on with the fierceneis of lions, yet they wanted
the subtilty of foxes, being out of all manner of order, and
straggling in heaps every way; and, indeed, when Witt
Sj after fifty of the savages had passed by, had ordered three of his men to give fire, so great was their consterna-
tion, to see so many men killed and wounded, and hear such
3 dreadful noise, and yet knew not whence it came, that
they were frightened to the highest degree ;- and when the second volley was given, they concluded no less but that
their companions were slain by thunder and lightning from
Heaven. In this notion they would have continued, had
Will Atkins and his men retired, as soon as they had fired,
according to order; or had the rest been near them to pour
in their shot continually, there might have been a complete
victory obtained; but staying to load their pieces agaiiv
discovered the whole matter. They were perceived by
some of the scattering savages at a distance, w.ho let fly their
arrows among them, wounded Atkins himselfrand killed his
fellow Englishman, and one of the Indians taken with the
women. Our party did not fail to answer them, and in their
retreat killed about twenty savages. Here I cannot but
take notice of our poor dying slave, who, though stopt from his retreat by a fatal arrow, yet with his staff and hatchet
desperately and gallantly assailed his pursuers, and killed.
five of the savages before his life submitted to a multiplicity of wounds. Nor is the cruelty or malice of the Indians to
be less remarked, in breaking the arms, legs, and heads of
the two dead bodies, with their clubs and wooden swords,
after a most wretched manner. As Atkins retreated, our
party advanced, to interpose between him and the savages:
but, after three vollies, we were obliged to retreat also;
for they were so numerous and desperate, that they came
up to our very teeth, shot their arrows like a cloud, and
their wounded men enraged with cruel pain, fought like
madmen. They did not, however, think fit to follow us, but
drawing themselves up in a circle, they gave two triumphant
shouts in token of victory, though they had the grief to see
several of their wounded men bleed to death before them.
"After I had, Sir,drawn up my little army together, upon
a rising ground, Atkins, wounded as he was, would have
had us attack the whole body of the savages at once. I
was extremely well pleased with the gallantry of the man:
but upon consideration, I replied, " You perceive, Seig-
"nior Atkins, how their wounded men fight, let them
alone till morning, when they will be faint, stiff, and sore,.
** and then we shall have fewer to combat with." To
which Atkins, smiling, replied, "That's very true, Seig-
or ROBINSON cRtsoi. 183
"nior, so sliall I too; and that's the reason I would fight
"them now I am warm." We all answered, Seignior
Atkins for your part, you have behaved very gallantly; and
ifyou are not able to approach the enemy in the morning,
we will fight for you, till then we think it convenient to
wait, and so we tarried.
"By the brightness of the moon that night, we perceived
the savages in great disorder about their dead and wounded
men. This made us change our resolution, and resolve to
fall upon them in the night, if we could give them one vol-
ley undiscovered. This we had a fair opportunity to do,
by one of the two Englishmen leading us round, between
the woods and the sea-side westward, and turning short
south, came privately to a place where the thickest of them
were. Unheard and unperceived, eight of us fired among
them, and did dreadful execution; and in half a minute
after, eight more of us let fly, killing and wounding abund-
ance of them; andthen dividing ourselves into three bodies,
eight persons in each body, we marched from among the
trees, to the very teeth of the enemy, sending forth the
greatest shouts and acclamations. The savages hearing a
.different noise from three quarters at once, stood in the
utmost confusion; but coming in sight of us, let fly a volley
of arrows, which wounded poor old Friday, yet happily it
did not prove mortal. We did not, however, give them a
second opportunity; but rushing in among them, we fired
three several ways, and then fell to work with our swords,
staves, hatchets, and the butt end of our muskets, with a
fury not to be resisted; so that, with the most dismal scream-
ing and howling, they had recourse to their feet, to save their
lives by a speedy flight. Nor must we forget the valour
of the two women; for they exposed themselves to the
greatest dangers, killed many with their arrows, and va-
liantly destroyed several more with their hatchets.
"In fighting these two battles, we were so much tired,
that we did not then trouble ourselves to pursue them to
their canoes, in which we thought they would presently
put to the ocean; but there happening a dreadful storm at
sea, which continuing all that night, it not only prevented their
voyage, but dashed several of their boats to pieces against
the beach, and drove the rest so high upon the shore, that it
required infinite labour to get them off. After our men had
taken some refreshment and a little repose, they resolved
6
early in the morning to go towards the place of their land-
ing, and see whether they were gone off, or in what posture
they remained. This necessarily led them to the place of
battle, where several of the savages were expiring, a sight
no way pleasing to generous minds, to delight in misery,
though obliged to conquer them by the law of arms; but
our own Indian slaves put them out of their pain, bv de-
spatching them with their hatchets. At length coming in
view of the remainder of the army, we found them leaning
upon their knees, which were bended toward their mouth, and the head between the two hands. Hereupon, coming
within musket-shot of them, I ordered two pieces to be fired
without ball, in order to alarm them, that we might plainly
know, whether they had the courage to venture another
battle, or were utterly dispirited from such an attempt, tliat
so we might accordingly manage them. And, indeed, the
project took very weli; for, no sooner did the savages hear
the first gun, and perceive the flash of the second, but they
suddenly started upon their feet, in the greatest conster-
nation; and when we approached towards them, they ran
howling and screaming away up the hill into the country.
"We could rather, at first, have wished that the weather
had permitted them to have gone ott'to the sta; but when
we consider that their escape might occasion the approach
of multitudes, to our utter ruin and desolation, we were
very well pleased the contrary happened: Will Atkins
(who, though wounded, would not part from us all this while)
advised us not to let slip this advantage, but clapping be-
tween them and their boats, deprive them of the capacity
of ever returning to plague the island: "1 know," said he,
"there is but one objection you can make, which is, that
these creatures living like beasts in the woods, may make
excursions, ritle the plantations, and destroy the tame
"goals; but then, consider, we had better to do with an
"hundred men, whom we can kill, or make slaves of at
leisure, than with an hundred nations, whom it is ira-
"pofsible we should save ourselves from, much lefs sub-
"due." This advice, and these arguments being approved
of, we set fire to their boats; and though they were so wet
that we could not burn them entirely, yet we made them
incapable for swimming in the seas. As soon as the Indians
perceived what we were doing, many of them ran out of the
woods, in sight oi us and kneeling down, pitcously cried out,
Oa, Oa, Waramalma. Intimating, Isuppose, that, if we would
but spare their canoes, they would never trouble us again.
"But all their complaints, submissions, and entreaties,
were in vain; for self-preservation obliging us to the con-
trary, we destroyed every one of them that had escaped the
fury of the ocean. When the Indians perceived this, they
raised a lamentable cry, and ran into the woods, where they continued ranging about, making the woods ring with their
lamentations. Here we should have considered, that making these creatures thus desperate, we ought, at the same time,
to have set a sufficient guard upon the plantations: for the
savages, in their ranging about, found out the bower, destroyed the fences, trod the corn down under their feet, aiul
tore up the vines and grapes. It is true, we were always
able to fight these creatures; but as they were too swift for
us, and very numerous, we durst not go out single, for fear
of them; though that too was needles*, they having nt
weapons, nor any materials to make them: and indeed, their extremity appeared in a little time after.
"Though the savages, as already mentioned, had de-
stroyed our bower, and all our corn, grapes, &c. yet we
had still left our stock of cattle in the valley, by the cave,
witli some little corn that grew there, and the plantation of Will Atkins and his companions, one of whom being killed by an arrow, they were now reduced to two: it is renjd.k-
u'jie ttiat this was the fellow who cut the poor Indian witn
his hatchet, and had a design to murder me and my coun-
trymen the Spaniards. As our condition was so loyv, we
came to the resolution to drive thesavages up to the iarther
part of the island, where no Indians landed; to kill as many
of them as we could, till we had reduced their number; and then to give the remainder some corn toplant, and to teach them how to live by their daily labour. Accordingly we
pursued them with our guns, at the hearing of which they were so terrified, that they would iall to the ground.
Evvry day we killed and wounded some of them, and many
were found starved to death, so that our hearts began tore-
ii..nt at the sight of such miserable objects. At last, witlj
great difficulty, taking one of them alive, and using him
with kindness, and tenderness, we brought him to old Fri-
day, who talked to him, and told him how good we would
be to them all, giving them corn and land to plant and live
in, and present nourishment, provided they should keep Q
within such bounds as should be allotted them, and not do
prejudice to others: "Go then," said he, "and inform
your countrymen of this; which, if they will not agree to,
every one of them shall be slain."
"The poorcreatures, thoroughly humbled, being reduced
to about thirty-seven, joyfully accepted the offer, and earn-
estly begged for food; hereupon we sent twelve Spaniards
and two Englishmen, well armed, together with old Friday,
and three Indian slaves were loaded with a large quantity
of bread and rice cakes, with three live goats: and the
poor Indians being ordered to sit down on the side of the
hill, they ate the victuals very thankfully, and have proved
faithful to the last, never trespassing beyond their bounds,
where at this day they quietly and happily remain, and
where we now and then visit them. They are confined to
n neck of land about a mile and a half broad, and three or
four in length, on the south.east corner of the island, the
sea being before, and lofty mountains behind them, free
from the appearance of canoes; and indeed their country-
men never made any inquiry after them. We gave them
twelve hatchets, and three or four knives; have taught
them to build huts, make wooden spades, plant corn, make
bread, breed tame goats and milk them, as likewise to make
wicker-work, in which, I must ingenuouslv confess, they
infinitely outdo us, having made themselves several pretty
necessaries and fancies, as baskets, sieves, birdcages, and
cupboards, as also stools, beds, and couches, no less useful
than delightful; and now they live the most innocent and
inoffensive creatures that ever were subdued in the world,
wanting nothing but wives to make them a nation.
"Thus, kind Sir, have I given you, according to my
ability an impartial account of the various transactions that
have happened in the island since your departure, to this
day; and we have great reason to acknowledge the kind
providence of Heaven in our merciful deliverance. When
you inspect your little kingdom, you will find in it some
little improvement, your flocks increased, and your subjects
augmented, so that from a desolate island, as this was before
your wonderful deliverance upon it, here is a visible pros-
pect of its becoming a populous and well governed little
kingdom, to your immortal fame and glory."
There is no doubt to suppose but that the preceding re-
lation of my faithful Spaniard was very agreeable, and no less surprising to me, to the young priest, and to all who
heard it: nor were these people less pleased with those necessary utensils that I brought them, such as the knives,
scissars, spades, shovels, and pick-axes, with which they
now adorned their habitations.
So much had they addicted themselves to wicker-work,
prompted by the ingenuity of the Indians, who assisted them,
that when I viewed the Englishmen's colonies, they seemed
at a distance as though they had lived like bees in a hive:
it.iT Will Atkins, who has now become a very industrious
and sober man, had made himself a tent of basket-work
round the outside; the walls were worked in as a basket,
in pannels or strong squares of thirty-two in number, stand-
ing about seven leet high: in the middle was another, not
above twenty-two paces round, but much stronger built, being of an octagonal form, and in the eight corners stood
eight strong posts, round the top of which he laid strong
pieces, pinned with wooden pins, from which he raised a pyramid for the roof, mighty pretty, I assure you, and joined
very well together with iron spikes, which he made him-
self; for he had made him a forge, with a pair of wooden
bellows, and charcoal for his work, forming an anvil out of one of the iron crows, to work upon, and in this manner
would he make himself hooks, staples, spikes, bolts, and
hinges. After he had pitched the roof of his innermost tent,
he made it so rirm between the rafters with basket-work,
thatching that over again with rice-straw, and over that a
large leaf of a tree, that his house was as dry as if it had
been tiled or slated. The outer circuit was covered as a
lean-to, quite round this innerapartment, laying long rafters
from the thirty-two angles to the top posts of the inner
house, about twenty feet distant, so that there was a space
like a wall between the outer and inner wall, near twenty
leet in breadth. The inner place he partitioned off with
the same wicker-work, dividing it into six neat apartments,
every one of which had a door, first into the entry of the
main tent, and another into the space and walk that was
round it, not only convenient for retreat, but for family ne-
cessaries. Within the door of the outer circle, there was a
passage directly to the door of the inner-house; on either
side was a wicker partition, and a door, by which you got
into a room twenty-two feet wide, and about thirty long, Qa
and through that into another of a smaller length; so that ia
the outer circle were ten handsome rooms, six of which
were only to be come at through the apartments of the in-
ner tent, serving as retiring rooms to the respective cham-
bers of the inner circle, and four large warehouses, which
went in through one another, two on either hand of the
passages that led through the outer door to the innertent.—
In short nothing could be built more ingeniously, kept more
neat, or have better conveniences; and here lived the
three families, Will Atkins, his companion, their wives and
children, and the widow of the deceased. As to religion,
the men seldom taught their wives the knowledge of God,
any more than the sailor's custom of swearing by his name.
The greatest improvement their wives had, was, they
taught them to speak English, so as to be understood. None of their children were then above six years old;
they were all fruitful enough, and I think the cook's mate's
wife was big of her sixlh .child.
When I inquired of the Spaniards about their circum.
Ktances while among the savages, they told me, that they
abandoned themselves to despair, reckoning themselves a
poor and miserable people, that had no means put into their
hands, and consequently must soon be starved to death.—They owned, however, that they were in the wrong to think
so, and for refusing the assistance that reason offered for
their support, as well as future deliverance, confessing that
grief was a most insignificant passion, as it looked upon
things as without remedy, and having no hope of things to
come; all which verified this noted proverb,
In trouble to he'troohled,
Is to have your troubte doubted.
Nor did these remarks end here; for, making observa-
tions upon my improvement, and on my condition at first,
infinitely worse than theirs, he told me, that Englishmen
had, in their distress, greater presence of mind than those
of any other country that he had met with; and that they
and the Portuguese were the worst men in the world to
struggle under misfortunes. When they landed among the
savages, they found but little provision, except they would
turn cannibals, there being but a few roots and herbs, witu
lutle substance in them, and of which the natives gave them
But very sparingly. Many were the ways they took to
tivilize and teach the savages, but in vain; for they would
not own them to be their instructors, whose lives were ow-
ing to their bounty. Their extremities were very great,
being many days entirely without food, the savages there
being more indolent and less devouring than those who
had better supplies. When they went out to battle they
were obliged to assist these people, in one of which my
faithful Spaniard being taken, had like to have been de-
voured. They had lost their ammunition, which rendered
their fire-arms useless; nor could they use the bows and
arrows that were given them, so that while the armies were
at a distance they had no chance, but when close, then they
could be of service with halbsrts,-and sharpened sticks put
into the muzzles of their muskets. They made themselves
targets of wood, covered with the skins of wild beasts; an:l
when one happened to be knocked down, the rest of the
company fought over him till he recovered : and then stand-
ing close in a line, they would make their way through a
thousand savages. At the return of their friends, who they
thought had been entombed in the bowels of their enemies,
their joy.was inconceivable. Nor were they less surprised
at the sight of the loaves of bread I had sent them, things
that they had not seen for several years, at the same time crossing and blessing it, as though it was manna sent from Heaven: but when they knew the errand, and perceived
the boat which was to carry them to the person and place
from whence such relief came, this struck them with such
a surprise of joy as maue some of them .faint away, and
others burst out into tears.
This was the summary account that I had from them.—
I shall now inform the reader what I next did for them, and
in what condition I left them. As we were all of opinion
that as the savages would scarce trouble them any more, so
we had no apprehensions on that score. I told them I was
come purely to establish, and not to remove them; and
upon that occasion, had not only brought them necessaries
for convenience and defence, but also artificers, and other
persons, both for their necessary employments, and to add
toiheir number. They were all together when I thus talked
to them; and before I delivered to them the stores I brought,
I asked them one by one, if they had entirely forgot theic..
Q3 '.
tifit animosities, would engage in the strictest friendship,
and shake hands with one another? On this Will Atkins,
with abundance of good humour, said, they had afflictions
enough to make them all sober, and enemies enough to
make them all friends: as for himself he would live and
die among them, owning that what the Spaniards had done
to him, his own mad humour had made necessary for them
to do. Nor had the Spaniards occasion to justify their pro-
ceedings to me; but they told me, that since Will Atkins
had behaved himself so valiantly in fight, and at other times
showed such a regard to the common interest of them all,
they had not only forgotten all that was past, but thought
he ought as much to be trusted with arms and necessaries
as any of them, which they tesiified by making him next in
command to the governor: and they most heartily embraced
the occasion of giving me this solemn assurance, that they
would never separate their interest again as long as they lived.
After these kind declarations of friendship, we appointed
all of us to dine together the next day; upon this I caused
the ship's cook and his mate to come on shore for that pur-
pose, to assist in dressing our dinner. We brought from
the ship six pieces of beef, and four of pork, together with
our punch-bowl, and materials to fill it; and in particular I
gave them ten bottles of French claret, and ten of English
beer, which was very acceptable to them. The Spaniards
added to our feast five whole kids, which being roasted,
three of them were sent as fresh meat to the sailors on board,
and the other two we eat ourselves. After our merry and
innocent feast was over, I began to distribute my cargo
among them. First, I gave them linen sufficient to make
every one of them four shirts, and at the Spaniard's request
made them up six. The thin English. stuffs 1 allotted to
make every one a light coat like a frock, agreeable to th«
climate., and left them such a quantity as to make more upon
their decay; as also pumps, shoes, hats, and stockings. It
is not to be expressed the pleasing satisfaction which sat
upon the countenances of these poor men, when they per-
ceived what care I took of them, asifl had been a common
inther to them all; and they all engaged never to leave the
island, till I gave my consent for their departure. I then
prest-'nted U> them the people I brought, viz. the tailor,
smith, and the two carpenters; but my Jack-of-all-Trades
was the most acceptable present I could make them. Mjr
tailor fefl hnmediately to work, and made every one of them
a shirt; after which, he learned j^e-women how to sew and
stitch, thereby to become the moFe helpful to their husbands.
Neither were the carpenters less useful, taking in pieces their
clumsy things; instead of which they made convenient and
handsome tables, stools, bedsteads, cupboards, lockers, and
shelves. But when I carried them to see Will Atkins's
basket-house, they owned they never saw such a piece of
natural ingenuity before: "I am sure," said one of the car-
penters, " the man that built this has no need of us; you
"'need, Sir, do nothing but give him tools."
I divided the tools among them in this manner: to every
man I gave a digging spade, a shovel, and a rake, as having
no harrows or ploughs; and to every separate place a pick-
-axe, a crow, a broad ax, and a saw, with a store for a general
supply, should any be broken or worn out. I left them also
nails, staples, hinges, hammers, chissels, knives, scissars, and
all sorts of tools and iron work; and for the use of the
smith, gave them three tons of unwrought iron, for a sup-
ply; and as to arms and ammunition, I stored them even to
profusion; or at least, to equip a sufficient little army
against all opposers whatsoever.
The young man (whose mother was unfortunately starved
to death) together with.the maid, a pious and well educated
young woman, seeing things so well ordered on shore, (for
I made them accompany me) and considering they had no
occasion to go so far a voyage as to the East-Indies, they
both desired of me, that I would leave them there, and
enter them among my subjects. This I readily agreed to,
ordering them a plat of ground, on which were three little
houses erected, environed with basket-work, pallisadoed
like Atkins's, andadjoining to his plantation. So contrived
were their tents, that each of them had a room apart to
lodge in, while their middle tent was not only their store-
-house, but their place for eating and drinking. At this
time the two Englishmen removed their habitation to their
former place; so that now the island was divided into three
colonies: first, Those I have just now mentioned; secondly,
That of Will Atkins, where there were four families of
Englishmen, with their wives and children, the widow and
her children; the young man and the maid, who, by the
way, we made a wife of before our departure; three sa-
vages, who were slaves; the tailor, smith, (who served also as a gunsmith) and my other celebrated person called Jatkr-
of-all-Trades: Thirdly, My chief colony, which consisted of
the Spaniards with Old Friday, who still remained at my
old habitation, which was my capital city; and surely never
was there such a metropolis, it being now hid in so obscure
a grove, that a thousand men might have ranged the island
a month, and looked purposely for it, without being able to
find it, though the Spaniards had enlarged its boundaries,.
bolh without and within, in a most surprising manner.
But now I think it high time to speak of the young French
priestoftheorderofSt. Benedict, whose judicious and pious
discourses, upon sundry occasions, merit an extraordinary
observation; nor can his being a French papist priest, I pre-
sume, give offence to any of my readers, when they have
this assurance from me, that he was a person of a most
courteous disposition, extensive charity, and exalted piety.
His arguments were always agreeable to reason, and his
conversation the most acceptable of any person that I had
ever yet met with in my life."Sir," said he, to me, one day, "since, under God,"
at the same time crossing his breast, "you have not only
.saved my life; but by permitting me to go this voyage,
have granted me the happiness of free conversation, I
think it my duty, as my profession obliges me, to save
what souls I can, by bringing them to the knowledge of
some catholic doctrine, necessary to salvation; and since
these people are under your immediate government, in
gratitude, justice, and decency, for what you have done
for me, I shall offer no farther points in religion, than
what merit your approbation." Being pleased with the
modesty of his carriage, I told him he should not be worse
used for being of a different persuasion, if upon that very
account we did not differ in points of faith, not decent in
a part of the country where the poor Indians ought to be
instructed in the knowledge of the true God, and his Son
Jesus Christ. To this he replied, that conversation might
easily be separated from disputes; that he would discourse
with me rather as a gentleman than on religion; but that,
if we did enter upon religious arguments, upon my desiring
the same, I would give him liberty to defend his own prin-
ciples. He farther added, that he would do all that became
him in his office, as a priest as well as a Christian, to pro-
core the happiness of all that were in the ship: that though he could not pray with, he would pray for us on all occa-
sions; and then he told me several extraordinary events of
his lite, within a few years past; but particularly in this last, which was the most remarkable: that in this voyage,
he had the misfortune to be five times shipped and unshipped:
his first design was to have gone to Martinico; for which
taking ship at St. Maloes, he was forced into Lisbon by bad
weather, the vessel running a-ground in the mouth of the
Tagus; that from thence he went on board a Portuguese
ship, bound to the Madeiras, whose master being but an in-
different mariner, and out of his reckoning, they were drove
to Fial, where selling their commodity, which was corn, they
resolved to take in their loading at the isle of May, and to
sail to Newfoundland; at the Banks of which, meeting a
French ship bound to Quebec, in the river of Canada, and
from thtnce to Martinico, in this ship he embarked; the
master of which dying at Quebec, that voyage was sus-
pended; and lastly shipped himself for France, this last
ship was destroyed by fire, as before has been related.
At this time we talked no further; but another morning
he comes to me, just as I was going to visit the English-
men's colony, and tells me, that as he knew the prosperity
of the island was my principal desire, he had something to
communicate agreeable to my design, by which perhaps he might put it, more than he yet thought it was, in the way
of the benediction of Heaven. "How, Sir!" said I, in a
surprise, "are we not yet in the way of God's blessings,
after all these signal providences and deliverances, of which
you have had such an ample relation?" He replied, " I hope,
Sir, you are in the way, and that your good design will
prosper: but still there are some among you that are not
equally right in their actions; and remember, I beseech
you, Sir, that Achan, by his crime, removed God's blessing
from the camp of the children of Israel; that though six
and thirty were entirely innocent, yet they became the ob-
jects of divine vengeance, and bore the weight of his punish-
ment accordingly." So sensibly was I touched with this discourse, and so sa-
tisfied with that ardent piety that inflamed his soul, that I
desired him to accompany me to the Englishmen's planta-
tions, which he was very glad of, by reason they were the
subject of what he designed to discourse with me about:
and while we walked on together, he began in the follow-
ing manner:
"Sir, said he, I must confess it is a great unhappiness
that we disagree in several doctrinal articles of religion; but
surely both of us acknowledge this, that there is a God,
who having given us some stated rules for our service and
obedience, we ought not willingly and knowingly to offend
him; either by neglecting what he has commanded, or by
doing what he has forbidden. This truth every Christian
owns, that when any one presumptuously sins against God's
command, the Almighty then withdraws his blessing from
him; every good man therefore ought certainly to prevent
such neglect of, or sin against, God and his commands. I
thanked the young priest for expressing so great a concem
<or us, and desired him to explain the particulars of what
he had observed, that according to the parable of Achan, I
"mighi remove that accursed thing from among us." Whythen, Sir, said he, in the first place, you have four English-
men, who huve tuki'n savage women to their wives, by
whom they have several children, though none of them are legally married, as the law of God and man requires; they,
I say, Sir, arc no less than adulterers, and as they still live
in adultery, are liable to the curse of God. I know, Sir,
you may object the want of a priest, or clergyman of any
kind; as also, pen, ink, and paper, to write down a contract of marriage, and have it signed between them. But
neither this, nor what the Spanish governor has told you of
their choosing by consent, can be reckoned a marriage, nor
any more than an agreement to keep them from quarrelling
among themselves: for, Sir, the essence or sacrament of
matrimony (so he called it) not only consists in mutual con-
sent, but in the legal obligation, which compels them to
own and acknowledge one another, to abstain trum other
persons, the men to provide for their wives and children,
and the women to the same and like conditions, mutatis mu-
tandis, on their side: whereas, Sir, these men, upon their
own pleasure, on any occasion, may forsake those women,
and marry others, and by disownmg their children, sailer
them utterly to perish." "Now, Sir," added he, "can
God be honoured in such an unlawful liberty as this? how can a blessing succeed to the best endeavours, if men are
allowed to live in so licentious a way {" I was indeed struck
with the thing myself, and thought that they were much to
blame, that no formal contract had been made, though it
had been but breaking a stick between them, to srgagc
them to live as man and wife, never to separate, but love,
cherish, and comfort one another all their lives; "yet,
Sir," said I, " when they took these women, I was not here,
and if it is adultery, it is past my remedy, and I cannot help
it." "True, Sir," answered the young priest, "you can-
not be charged with that part of the crime which was done
in your absence: but I beseech you don't flatter yourself,
that you are under no obligation now to put a period to it:
which if you neglect to do, the guilt will be entirely on you
alone, since it is certainly in nobody's power but yours, to
alter their condition." I must confess, 1 was so dull, that I
thought he meant I should part them, and knowing that
this would put the whole island into confusion, 1 told him I
could not consent to it upon any account whatsoever. "Sir,"
said he, in great surprise, "I do not mean that you should
separate, but marry them, by a written contract, signed by
both man and woman, and by all the witnesses present,
which all the European laws decree to be of sufficient ef-
ficacy." Amazed with such true piety and sincerity, and
considering the validity of a written contract, I acknowledged
all that he said to be very just and kind, and that I would
discourse with the men about it; neither could I see what
reason they could have not to let him marry them, whose authority in that affair is owned to be as authentic as if they
were married byany of our clergymen in England.
The next complaint he had to make to me was this, that
though these English subjects of mine have lived with these
women seven years, and though they were of good under-
standing, and capable of instruction, having learned not
only to speak, but to read English, yet all thjs while they
had never taught them any thingof the Christian religion,
or the knowledge of God, much less in what manner he
ought to be served. And is not this an unaccountable
neglect?" said he warmly. "Depend upon it, God Al-
mighty will call them to account for such contempt. And
though I am not of your religion, yet I should be glad to
see these people released from the devil's power, and be
saved by the principles of the Christian religion, the know-
ledge of God. "f a Redeemer, the resurrection, and of a
future state. But as it is not too late, if you please to give
me leave to instruct them, I doubt not but I shall supply
this great dtfect, by bringing them into the great circle of Christianity, even while you continue in the island,"
I could hold no longer, but embracing him, told him,
with a thousand thanks, I would grant whatever he request-
ed, and desired him to proceed in the third article, which
he did in the following manner:
"Sir," said he, "it should be a maxim among all Christ-
ians, that Christian knowledge ought to be propagated
by all possible means, and on all occasions. Upon this
accountour church sends missionaries into Persia, India, and
China, men who are willing to die for the sake of God and
the Christian faith, in order to bring poor infidels into the
way of salvation. Now, Sir, as here is an opportunity to
convert seven and thirty poor savages, I wonder how you
can pass by such an occasion of doing good, which is really worth the expense of a man's whole life."
I must confess I was so confounded at this discourse, that
I could not tell how to answer him. "Sir," said he, seeing
me in disorder, " I shall be very sorry if I have given you
offence." "No, Sir," said I, " I am rather confounded;
and you know my circumstances, that being bound to the
East-Indies in a merchant ship, I cannot wrong the owners
to much, as to detain the ship here, the men laying at victuals and wages on their account. If I stay above twelve
days, I must pay 3/. sterling per diem demurrage, nor must
the ship stop above eight days more; so that I am unable to engage in this work, unless I would leave the ship, and
be reduced to my former condition." The priest, ihcugii
he owned this was hard upon me, yet laid it to my con-
science, whether the blessing of saving seven and thirty
souls was not worth venturing all that 1 had in the world?"
"Sir," said I, "it is very true: but as you are an ecclesias-
tic, it naturally falls into your profession; why, therefore,
don't you rather offer to undertake it yourself, than press
me to it i" upon this he turned about, making a very low
bow, "I most humbly thank God and you, Sir, (said he)
for so blessed a call; and most willingly undertake so glo-
rious an office, which will sufficiently compensate all the hazards and difficulties I have gone through in a long and
uncomfortable voyage."
While he was thus speaking, I could discover a rapture
in his face, by his colour going and coming; at the same
time his eyes sparkled like lire, and all tlie signs oi" the
most zealous transports. And when I asked whether he
was in earnest ?" Sir," said he, "it was to preach to the 6
Indians I consented to come along with you; these infidels,
even in this little Island, are infinitely of more worth than
my poor life: if so that Ishould prove the happy instrument
of saving these poor creatures' soul?, I care not if 1 never
see my native country again. One thing I only beg of you
more is, that you would leave Friday with me, to be my
interpreter, without whose assistance neither of us will
understand each other."
This request very sensibly troubled me: first upon Fri-
day's being bred a Protestant; and secondly, for the af-
fection I bore to him for his fidelity: But immediately the
remembrance of Friday's father coming into my head, I re-
commended him to him as having learned Spanish, which
the priest also understood; and so was thoroughly satisfied
with him.
When we came to the Englishmen, after I had told them
what necessary things I had done for them, I talked to them
of the scandalous life thev led ; told them what notice the
clergymen had taken of it, and asked them if they were
married men or bachelors? they answered, two of them
were widowers, and the other three single men. But said
I, with what conscience can you call these your wives, by
whom you have so many children, and yet are not lawfully
married? they all said, that they took them before the
Governor as such, having nobody else to marry them, which they thought as legal, as if they had a parson. No
doubt, said I, but in the eye of God it is so: but unless I
am assured of your honest intent, never to desert these poor
creatures, I can do nothing more for you, neither can you
expect God's blessing while you live in such an open course
of adultery. Hereupon Will Atkins, who spoke for the rest,
told me, that they believed their wives the most innocent
and virtuous creatures in the world; that they would never
forsake them while they had breath; and that, if there was
a clergyman in the ship, they would be married to them
with all their hearts. I told you before, said I, that I have
a minister with me, who shall marry you to-morrow morn-
ing, if you are willing; so I would have you consult to-
night with the rest about it. I told him the clergyman was
a Frenchman, and knew not a word of English, but that I
would act as clerk between them. And indeed this busi-
ness met with such speedy success, that they all told me, in a few minutes after, that they were ready to be formally
married, as soon as I pleased; with which informing the
priest, he was exceedingly rejoiced.
Nothing now remained, but that the women should he
made sensible of the meaning of the thing: with which be-
ing well satisfied, they with their husbands attended at my
apartment the next morning; there was my priest, habited
in a black vest, something like a cassock, with a sash round
it, much resembling a minister, and 1 was his interpreter.
But the seriousness of his behaviour, and the scruples he
made of marrying the women, who were not baptized, gave
them an exceeding reverence for his person: nor indeed
would he marry them at all, till he obtained my liberty to
discourse both with the men and women, and then he told
them, that in the sight of all indifferent men, and in the
sense of the laws of society, they had lived in open adultery,
which nothing now, but their consent to marry, or final
separation, could put an end to; and even here was a diffi-
culty with respect to thelaws of Christian matrimony, in
marrying a professed Christian to a heathen idolater, unbaptized; but yet there was time enough to make them
profess the name of Christ, without which nothing could be
done; that, besides, he believed they were very indifferent
Christians: and consequently had not discoursed with their
wives upon that subject; and that unless they promised
him to do so, he could not marry them, as being expressly
forbidden by the laws of God.
All this they heard attentively, and owned readily."But, Lord, Sir," said Will Atkins to me, " how should
we teach them religion, who know nothing ef it ourselves?
how can we talk to our wives of God, Jesus Christ, hea-
ven and hell? why they would only laugh at us, who never
yet have practised religion, but on the contrary all manner
of wickedness." "Will Atkins," said I, "cannot you tell your wife she is in the wrong, and that her gods are id:tls,
which can neither speak nor understand; but that our God,
who has made, can destroy all things; thai he rewards the
good and punishes the wicked; and at last will bring us 'o
judgment- cannot you tell her these things?" "Thai's
true," said Will Atkins, "but then she'll te:l mo it is utterly
false, since I am not punished and sent to the devil, who
hath been such a wicked creature." These words I inter-
preted to the priest. '' Oh!" suidhe, "tell him his repent-
ance will make him a very good minister to his spouse, and
qualify him to preach on the mercy and long-suffering of a
merciful Being, who desires not the death of a sinner, and
even defers damnation to the last judgment; this will lead
him to the doctrine of the resurrection, and will make him
an excellent preacher to his wile." I repeated this to Atkins,
who being more than ordinary affected with it, replied,
"I know all this, Sir, and a great deal more | but how can
1 litvo the impudence to talk thus to my wife, when my
conscience witnesses against me?" " Alas!" said he (with tears in hi* eye*, and giving a great sigh) " as for repenting,
that U for ever past me." "Past you! Atkins," said I
"what do you mean?" "You know well enough," said he,
"what I mean; I mean it is too late."
When I told the priest what he said, the poor affectionate
man could not refrain from weeping; but recovering
himself, " Pray, Sir," said he, "ask him if he is contented
that it is too late; or is he concerned, and wishes it were
not so?" this question I put fairly to Atkins, who replied
in a passion," How can I be easy in a state which I know
must terminate in my ruin? for I really believe, some time
or other, I shall cut my throat, to put a period both to my
life, and to the terrors of my conscience."
At this the clergyman shook his head: "Sir," said he,
"pray tell him it is not too late; Christ will give him re-
pentance, if he has recourse to the merit of his passion.—
Does he think he is beyond the power of Divine Mercy?
there may indeed be a time when provoked mercy will no
longer strive, but never too late for men to repent in this
world." I told Atkins every word the priest had said, who
then parted from us to walk with his wife, while we dis-
coursed with the rest. But these were very stupid in reli-
gious matters: yet all of them promised to do their endea-
vours to make their wives turn Christians; and upon which
promises the priest married the three couple. But as At-
kins was the only sincere convert, and of more sense than
the rest, my clergyman was earnestly inquiring after him:
"Sir," said he, "let us walk out of this labyrinth, and I
dare say we shall find this poor man preaching to his wife
already." And indeed we found it true; for coming to the
edge of the wood, we perceived Atkins and his savage wife
titting under the shade of a bush, in very earnest discourse; R2
he pointed to the sun, to the quarters of the earth, to himself,
to her, the woods, and the trees. Immediately we could
perceive him start upon his feet, fall down upon his knees,
and lift up both his hands; at which the tears ran downmy
clergyman's cheeks; but our great misfortune was, we
could not hear one word that passed between them. Ano-
ther time he would embrace her, wiping the tears from her
eyes, kissing her with the greatest transports, and then both
kneel down for some minutes together. Such raptures of
joy did this occasion in my young priest, that he could
scarcely contain himself: And a little after this we observed
by her motion, as frequently lifting up her hands, and laying
them on her breast, that she was mightily affected with
his discourse, and so they withdrew from our sight.
When we came back we found them both waiting to be
called in; upon which he agreed to examine him alone, and
so 1 began thus to discourse to him. "Prithee, Will Atkins,"
said I, "what education have you? what was your Father?"
IV. A. A better man than ever I shall be; he was, Sir, a
clergyman, who gave me good instruction, or correction,
which 1 despised, like a brute as I was, and murdered my
poor father.
Pr. Ha! a murderer!
[Here the Priest started and icoi.'i/ fale, as thinking be had really
I':lledhis Fatber.]
R. C. What, did you kill him with your hands?
U'.A, No, Sir, 1 cut not his throat, but broke his heart
by the most unnatural turn of disobedience to the tendersst
an"! best of fathers.
R.C. Well, I pray God grant you repentance: I did
not ask you to extort a confession ; but I ask you because I
see you have more knowledge of what is good than your
companions.
W.A. O Sir, whenever I look back upon my past life,
conscience upbraids me with my father: the sins against
our parents make the deepest wounds, and their weight lies
the heaviest upon the mind.
R. C. You talk, Will, too feelingly and sensibly for me;
I am not able to bear it.
W. A. You bear it, Sir! you know nothing of it!
R. C. But yes, Atkins, I do; and every shore, valley,
ai:d tree in the island, witness the anguish of my soul far
my undutifidnesg to my kind father, whom I have murder-
ed likewise: yet my repentance falls infinitely short of
yours. Bur, Will, how comes the sense of this matter to touch you just now?
W.A. Sir, the work you have set me about, has occa-
sioned it; for talking to my wife about God and religion,
she has preached me such a sermon, that I shall retain it in
lasting remembrance.
R, C. No, no, it is your own moving pious arguments to
her, has made conscience fling them back upon you. But
pray, Atkins, inform us what passed between you and your
wife, and in what manner did you begin.
W. A, I talked to her of the laws of marriage, the reason
of such compacts, whereby order and justice is maintained;
without which men would run from their wives and chil-
dren, to the dissolution of families or inheritances.
R. C. Well, and what did she say to all this?
W, d. Sir, we began our discourse in the following man-
ner, which I shall exactly repeat according to my mean ca-
pacity, if you think it worth your while to honour it with
your attention.
THE DIALOGUE BETWEEN WILL ATKINS AND
HIS WIFE, IN THE WOOD.
Wife.—YOU tell me marriage God appoint, have you -
God in your country f
W. A. Yes, child, God is in every nation.
Wife. No; great old Benamuckee God is in my country,
not yours.
IV. A. My dear, God is in heaven, which he made; he
also made the earth, the sea, and all that is therein.
IVife. Why you not tell me much long ago?
W.A. My dear, I have been a wicked wretch, having.
a long time lived without the knowledge of God in the
world.
Wife. What, not know great God in own nation? No
do good ting? no say O to him? that's strange!
W. A. But, my dear, many live as if there was no God
in heaven for all that.
Wife. Why God suifer them; why makee not live well?
W. A. It is our own faults, child.
Wife. But if he is much great, can makee kill, why no
makee kill when no serve him? no be good mans, no cry
O to him? R 3
IV. A. That's true, my dear, he may strike us dead, but
his abundant mercy spareth us.
Wife. Did not you tell God tankee for that?
W. A. No, I have neither thanked him for his mercy,
nor feared him for his power.
Wife. Then me not believe your God be good, nor
makee kill, when you make him angry.
W.A. Alas! must iny wicked life hinder you from be-
lieving in him?
Wife. How can me tink your God live there? (pointing
to Heaven ) Sure he no ken what do you here. W. A. Yes, my dear, he hears us speak, sees what we
do, and knows what we even think.
Wife. Where then makee power strong, when he hears
you curse, swear de great damn?
W. A. My dear this shows indeed he is a God and not
a man, who has such tender mercy.
Wife. Mercy! what you call mercy?
W. A. He pities and spares us: as he is our great Crea-
tor, so he is also our tender Father,
Wife, So God never angry, never kill wicked, then he
no good, no great mighty.
. W..4. O my dear, don't say so, he is both; and many
times he shows terrible examples of his judgment and ven-
geance.
Wife. Then you makee de bargain with him; you do
bad ting, he no hurt you, he hurt other mans.
W. A. No, indeed, my sins are all presumptions upon
his goodness.
Wife. Well, and yet no makee you dead; and you give
him no tankee neither?
W. A. It is true I am an ungrateful, unthankful dog, that
I am.
Wife. Why, you say, he makee you, why makee you no
much better then?
W. A. It is I alone that have deformed myself, and abused
his goodness.
Wife. Pray makee God know me, me no makee him
angry, no do bad ting.
W. A. You mean, my dear, that you desire I would teach
you to know God: alas! poor deat creature, he must teach
thec, and not I. But I'il pray earnestly to htm to direct
thee, and to forgive me a mist.iabie sinner, ^Hcr
went a little distance, and kneeling down, prayed earnestly to God to enlighten her mind, and to pardon his sins; when this was done, they continued their discourse thus.)
Wife. What you put down knee for? for what hold up
hand? Who you speak to?
W. A. My dear, I bowed in token of submission to him
that made me, and prayed that he would open your eyes
and understanding.
Wife. And can he do that too? and will he hear what
you say f
W, A. Yes, my dear, he bids us pray, and has given us
promise that he will hear us.
Wife. When did he bid you pray? what! do you hear
him speak?
W. A. No, my dear, but God has spoken formerly to
good men from heaven: and by divine revelation they have
written all his laws down in a book.
Wife. O where that good book f
W. A. I have it not now by me; but one time or other I
shall get it for you to read. Then he embraced her with
great affection.
Wife. Pray tell a mee, did God teachee them write that
book?
W. A. Yes, and by that rule we know him to be God.
Wife. What way, what rule you know him?
W. A. Because he teaches what is good, just, and holy; and forbids all wicked and abominable actions that incur
his displeasure.
Wife. O me fain understand that, and if he do all things
you say he do, surely he hear me say O to him; he make
me good if I wish to be good; he not kill me if I love him;
me tink, believe him great God; me say O to him, along
with you, my dear.
Here the poor man fell upon his knees, and made her
kneel down by him, praying with the greatest fervency,
that God would instruct her-by his holy Spirit ' and that
God by his providence would send them a Bible for both
their instructions. And such was the early piety of this
new convert, that she made him promise never to forsake
God any more, lest being made dead, as she called it, she
should not only want her instructor, but himself be miser-
able in a long eternity.
Such a surprising account as this was, proved very af-
ccting to as beUi, b.n particularly to the young clergyman, 
who was mightily concerned he could not talk to her himself.
"Sir," said he, "there is something more to be done to
this woman than to marry her: I mean that she ought to
be baptized." To this I presently agreed: "Pray," said
he, "ask her husband, whether he has ever talked to her of
Jesus Christ, the salvation of sinners, the nature of faith, and
redemption in and by him, and of the Holy Spirit, the resur-
rection, last judgment, and a future state;" but the poor
fellow melted into tears at this question, saying that he had
said something to her of these things, but his inability to
talk of them, made him afraid, least her knowledge of them
should rather make her contemn religion, than be benefited
by it; but that if I would discourse with her, it would be
very evident my labour would not be in vain. Accord-
ingly I called her in, and placing myself as interpreter be-
tween the religious priest and the woman, I entreated him to go on; but surely never was such a sermon preached by
any clergyman in these latterdays, with so much zeal, know-
ledge, and sincerity: in short, he brought the woman to
embrace the knowledge of Christ, and of redemption by
him, with so surprising a degree of understanding, that she
made it her own request to be baptized.
He then performed his office in the sacrament of baptism,
first, by saying some words over to himself in Latin, and
then asking me to give her a name, as being her godfather;
and pouring a whole dishful of water upon the woman's
head, he said, " Mary, I baptize thee, in the name of the
Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost;" so that
none could know of what religion he was. After this he
pronounced the benediction in Latin. Thus the woman
being made a Christian, he married her to Will Atkins;
which being finished, he affectionately exhorted him to
lead a holy life for the future; and since the Almighty, for
the convictions of his conscience, had honoured him to be the instrument of his wife's conversion, he should not dis-
honour the grace of God, that while the savage was con-
verted, the instrument should be cast away. Thus ended
a ceremony, to me the most pleasant and agreeable I ever
witnessed in my life.
The affairs of the island being settled, I waspreparing to
go on board, when the young man (whose mother was^tarv-ed) came to me, saying, that as he understood I had a cler-
gyman with me, who had married the Englishmen with 
savages, he had a match to make between two Christians,
which he desired might be finished before I departed.—
Thinking that it was he himself thathad courted his mother's
maid, I persuaded him not to do any thing rashly upon the
account of his solitary circumstances; that the maid was an
unequal match for him, both in respect to substance and
years; and that it was very probable he would live to re-
turn to his own country, where he might have a far better choice. At these words, smiling,he interrupted me, thank-
ing me for my good advice; that as he had nothing to beg
of me but a small settlement, with a servant or two, or some
new necessaries, so he hoped I would not be unmindful of
him when I returned to England, but give Itia letter to his
friends; and that when he was redeemed, the plantation,
and.all its improvements, however valuable, should be re-
turned to me again. But as for the marriage he proposed,
that it was not himself, but that it was between my Jack-ot-
all-trades and the maid Susan.
I wasindeed agreeably surprised at the mentioning this
match, which seemed very suitable, the one being a very
ingenious fellow, and the other an excellent, dexterous, and
sensible housewife, fit to be governess of the whole island:
so we married them the same day; and as 1 was her father
and gave her away, so I gave her a handsome portion, ap-
pointing her and her husband a convenient large spot of
ground for their plantation. The sharing out of the land I
left to Will Atkins, who really divided it very justly, to
every person's satisfaction; they only desired one general
writing under my hand for the whole, which 1 caused to be
drawn up, signed, and sealed to them setting out iheir
bounds, and giving them a right to the whole possession of
their respective plantations, with their improvements, to
them and their heirs, reserving all the rest of the island as
my own property, and a certain rent for every particular
plantation, after eleven years. As to their laws and go-
vernment, I exhorted them to love one another; and as to
the Indians who lived in a nook by themselves, I allotted
three or four of them plantations, and the rest willingly
chose to become servants to the other families, by which
means they were employed in useful labour, and fared
much better than they did before. Besides the savages be-
ing thus mixed with the Christians, the work of their con-
version might be set on foot by the latter, in the clergy-
man's absence, to ourequal satisfaction. The young priest,
however, was a little anxious lest the Christians should not
be willing to do their parts in instructing these poor Indi-
ans j I therefore told him we should call them all-together}
that he should speak to the Spaniards who were Papists,
and I to the English who were Protestants, and make them
promise that they would never make any distinction in re-
ligion, but teach the general true knowledge cf God, and
hi* Son Jtmn Chrbt, in order to convert the poor savages. And this, indeed, they all promised us accordingly.
When I fame lo Will Atkins's Itntme, 1 found his baptised
will•, and the young woman newly married to my Jack•uf.
ell Irurtes, wore become great intimates, ond discoursing of
religion toother, "O, Sir," nays Will Atkins, "when
God luis MItItLTS to reconcile to himself, he never wants an
instructor; I knew I was unworthy of so good a work, and
therefore this young woman has been sent hither as it were
from heaven, who is sufficient to convert a whole nation of
savages." The young woman blushed, and wan going to
rise; but I desired her to sit still, and hoped that God
would bless her tn so good a work j and then pulling out
a Bible (which 1 brought on purpose in my pocket for him,)
"Here Atkins," said I, " here is an assistant that perhaps
you had not before.'' So confounded was the poor man,
that it was some time before he could speak; at last turning
to his wife, "My dear," said he, "did I not tell you that God could hear what we said.' Here's the book I prayed
for, when you and I kneeled under the bush; God then
heard us, and now has sent it." The woman was surprised,
and thought really God had sent that individual book from
heaven; but I turned to the young woman, and desired her
to explain to the young convert, that God may properly be
said to answer our petitions, when, in the course of his pro-
vidence, such particular things came to pass as we petition-
ed for. This the young woman dtd effectually; but surely
Will Atkins's joy cannot be expressed; no man being more
thankful for any thing in the world, than he was tor his
Bible, nor desired it from a better principle.
After several religious discourses, I desired the young
woman to give me an account of the anguish she felt when
she was starving to death with hunger; to which she rea-
dily consented, and began in the following manner:
"Sir," said she, " all our victuals being gone, after I bad
fasted one day, my stomach was very sickly, and, at the ap-
preach of night, I was inclined to yawning and sleepy.—When I slept upon the couch three hours, I awaked a lit-
tle refreshed: three hours after, my stomach being more
and more sickly, I lay down again but could not sleep, be-
ing very faint and ill. Thus I passed the second day with
a strange variety, first hungry, then sick again, with Teachings to vomit: that night I dreamed I was at Barbadoes,
buying plenty of provisions, and dined heartily. But when
I awaked, my spirits were exceedingly sunk, to find myself
in the extremity of famine. There was but one glass of
wine, which being mixed with sugar, I drank up; but for
want of substance to digest upon, the fumes of it got into
my head, and made me senseless for some time. The third
day I was so ravenous and furious, that I could have eaten
a little child if it had come in my way; during which time
I was as mad as any creature in Bedlam. In one of these
fits I feil down, and struck my face against the corner of
a pallet-bed, were my mistress lay; the blood gushed out
of my nose, but by my excessive bleeding, both the violence
of the fever, and the ravenous part of the hunger abated.-—
After this, I grew sick again, strove to vomit but cou'd notj
then bleeding a second time, I swooned away as dead 5
when I came to myself, I had a dreadful gnawing pain in
my stomach, which went off towards night, with a longing
desire for food. I took a draught of water and sugar, but
it came up again; then I drank water without sugar, and
that staid with me. I laid me down on the bed, praying
God would take me away: after I had slumbered, I thought myself a-dying, therefore recommended my soul to God,
and wished somebody would throw me into the sea. All
this while my departing mistress lay by me: the last bit of
bread she had, she gave 18•her dear child, my young master.
The morning after I fell into a violent passion of crying,
and after that into hunger. I espied the blood that came
from my nose in a basin, which I immediately swallowed
up. At night I had the usual variations, as the pain in the stomach, sick, sleepy, and ravenous; and I had no thought
but that I should die before morning. In the morningcama
on terrible gripings in my bowels. At this time I heard my
young master's lamentations, by which I understood his
mother was dead. Soon after this, the sailors cried, 'A
tail t a sail!' hallooing as if they were distracted for joy of
that relief, which afterwards we received i'rom your hands,"
Surely never was a more distinct account of starving to
death than this. But to return to the disposition of tiiings
among my people, I did not take any notice to them of the
sloop that I had framed, neither would 1 leave them the
two pieces of brass cannon, or the two quarter-deck guns
that I had on board, lest, upon any disgust, they should
have separated, or turned pirates, and so make the island a
den of thieves, instead of a plantation of sober, pious peo-.
pie: but leaving them in a flourishing condition, with a
promise to send them further relief from Brazil, as sheep,
hogs, and cows, (being obliged tokill the latter at sea, having
no hay to feed them) I went on board the ship again, the
first of May, 1695, after having been twenty days among
them; and next morning, giving thenra salute of five guns
at parting, we set sail for the Brazils. The third day, to-
wards evening there happening a calm, and the current
being very strong, we were drove to the N. N. E. towards
the land. Some hours after, we perceived the sea covered
as it were with something very black, not easily at first to
be discovered: upon which our chief mate ascending the
shrouds a little way, and taking a view with the perspec-
tive glass, he cries out, " An army! an army !" " you fool,"
said I, " what do you mean?" "Nay, Sir," said he " don't
be angry, I assure you, it is not an army, but a fleet too,
for I believe thereare a thousand canoes paddling along,
and making with great haste towards us.''
- Indeed every one of us were surprised at this relation;
and my nephew, the captain, could not tell what to think
of it, but thought we should all be devoured. Nor was I
free from concern, when I considered how much we were becalmed, and what a strong current set towards the shore;
however, I encouraged him not to be afraid, but bring the
ship to an anchor, as soon as we were certain that we must
engage them. Accordingly we did so, and furled all our
sails; as to the savages we feared nothing, but only that
they might set the ship on fire; to prevent which, I ordered
them to get their boats out, and fasten them, one close by
the head, and another by the stern, well manned, \\ita
skeetaud buckets to extinguish the flames, should it so hap pen.
The savages soon came up with us, but there were not so
many as the mate had said, for instead of a thousand canoes
there wereonly one hundred and twenty; too many indeed
for us, several of their canoes containing about sixteen jot
seventeen men. As they approached us, they seemed to be in the great-
est amazement, not knowing what to make of us. They
rowed round the ship, which occasioned us to call to the
men in the boats not to suffer them to come near them.—
Hereupon they beckoned to the savages to keep back, which
they accordingly did; but at their retreat they let fly about
filty arrows among us, and very much wounded one of our
men in the long-boat. I called to them not to fire upon
any account, but handing them down some deal boards, the
carpenters made them a kind of fence to shield them from
the arrows. In half an hour after they carru; so near astern
of us, that we had a perfect sight of them; then they rowed
a little further out, till they came directly along-side of us,
and then approached so near, that they could hear us speak:
this made me order all my men to keep close, and get their
guns ready. In the mean time I ordered Friday to go out
upon deck, and ask them in his language what they meant.
No sooner did he do so, but six of the savages, who were
in the foremost canoe;, stooping down, showed us their
jmked backsides, as much as to say in English, Kiss our
———: but Friday quickly knew what this meant, by im-
mediateiv crving out they were going to shoot; unfortunately lor him, poor creature, who fell under the cloud of
three hundred arrows, no less than seven piercing through
his body, killing one of the best servants, and faiti.ifallesL of
companions in all my solitudes and afflictions.
So enraged was I at the death of poor Friday, that the
guns, which before were charged only with powder, to
frighten them, I ordered to be loaded with small shot; nor
did the gunners fail in their aim, but at this broadside split
and overset thirteen or fourteen of their canoes, which
killed numbers of them, and set the rest a swimming: the
others, frightened out of their wits, little regarding their
fellows drowning, scoured away as fast as they could. One
poor wretch our people took up, swimming for his life, an
hour after. He was verv sullen at first, so that he would
neither eat nor speak; but I took a way to cure him, by
ordering them to throw him into the sea, which they did,
and then he came swimming back like a cork, calling in his
tongue, as I suppose, to save him. So we took him on
board, but itwasalong time before we could make him speak
or understand English: yet when we had taught him, he told us, they were going with their kings to fight a ^rcat
S
battle; and when we asked him, what made them come up
to us? he said," to makee de great wonder look;" here
it is to be noted, that those natives, and those of Africa,
always add two e's at the end of English words, as makes,
takee, and the like, from which it is a very difficult thing to
make them break off.
Being now under sail, we took our last farewell of poor
honest Friday, and interred him with all possible decency
and solemnity, putting him in a coffin,.and committing
him to the deep, at the same time causing eleven guns to
be fired over him. Thus ended the life of one of the most
grateful, faithful, honest, and affectionate servants, that ever
any man was blessed with in the world.
Having now a fair wind for Brazil, in about twelve days
time we made land in the latitude of five degrees south of
the line. Four days we kept on S. by E. in sight of shore,
when we made Cape St. Augustine, and in three days we
came up to an anchor off the Bay of all Saints. I had great
difficulty here to get leave to hold correspondence on shore;
for neither the figure of my partner, my two merchant trus-
tees, nor the fame of my wonderful preservation in the
Island, could procure me the favour, till such time as the
prior of the monastery of the Augustines (to whom I had
given 50O-moidores) obtained leave from the Governor, lor
me, personally, with the captain and one more, together
with eight sailors, to come on shore; upon this condition,
that we should not land any goods out of the ship, nor
carry any person away without licence: I found means,
however, to get on shore three bales of English goods, such
as fine broad cloths, stuffs, and some linen, which I brought
as a present for my partner, who had sent me on board a
present of fresh provision?, wine, and sweetmeats, worth
about thirty moidores, including some tobacco, and three
or four fine gold medals.
Here I delivered my partner in goods to the value of
JOOl. sterling, and obliged him to fit up the sloop I bought
for the use of my island, in order tosendthem refreshments;
and so active was he in this matter, that he had the vessel
finished in a few days, to the master of which I gave par-
ticular instructions to find the place. I soon loaded him
with a small cargo; and one of our sailors offered to settle
there, upon myletter to the Spanish governor, if I would
allot him tools and a plantation. This I willingly granted, and gave him the savage we had taken prisoner to be his
slave. All things being ready for the voyage, my old
partner told me there was an acquaintance of his, a Brazil
planter, who having fallen under the displeasure of the
church, and in fear of the Inquisition, which obliged him to
be concealed, would be glad of such an opportunity to
make his escape, with his wife and two daughters; and if I
would allot them a plantation in my island, he would give
them a small stock to begin with, forthat the officers had al-
ready seized his effects and estate, and left him nothing but
a little household stuff and two slaves. This request I pre-
sently granted, concealing him and his family on board our
ship, till such time as the sloop (where all the effects were)
was gone out of the bay, and then we put them on board,
who carried some materials, and plants for planting sugar-canes, along with them. By this sloop, among other things,
I sent my subjects three milch cows and five calves, about
22 hogs, three sows big with pig, two mares and a stone-horse. I also engaged three Portugal women to go for sake
of the Spaniards, which, with the persecuted man's two
daughters, were sufficient, since the rest had wives of their
own, though in another country; all which cargo arrived safe
no doubt to their exceeding comfort, who, with this addi-
tion, were about sixty or seventy people, besides children.
At this place, my truly honest and pious clergyman left
me; for a ship, being ready to set sail for Lisbon, he asked
me leave to go thither; but I assure you it was with the
greatest reluctance I parted from a person, whose virtue
and piety merited the greatest esteem.
From the Brazils we made directly over the Atlantic
Ocean to the Cape of Good Hope, having a tolerable good
voyage, steering for the most part S. E. We were on a
trading voyage, and had a supercargo on board, who was
to direct all the ship's motions after she arrived at the Cape,
only being limited to a certain number of days, for stay, by
charter party, at the several ports she was to go to. At the
Cape we only took in fresh water, and then sailed for the
coast of Coromandel; we were there informed, that a French
man of war of 50 guns, and two large merchant ships, were
sailed for the Indies, but we heard no more of them.
In our passage, we touched at the Island of Madagascar,
where, though the inhabitants are naturally fierce and treaS2
cherous, and go constantly armed with bows and lances,
yet for some time they treated us civilly enough; and, in
exchange for knives, scissars, and other trifles, they brought
us eleven good fat bullocks, which we took partly for pre-
sent victuals, and the remainder to salt for the ship's use.
So curious was I to view every corner «f the world where
I came to, that I went on shore as often as I could. One
evening when on shore, we observed numbers of the people
stand gazing at us at a distance. We thought ourselves in
no danger, as they had hitherto used us kind'y. However,
we cut three boughs out of a tree, sticking them at a distance
from us, which it seems in that country, is not only a token
of truce and amity, but when poles or boughs are set upon
the other side, it is a sign the truce is accepted. In
these treaties, however, there is one principal thing to be
regarded, that neither party come beyond one another's
three poles or boughs; so that the middle space is not only
secure, but is aiso allowed as a market for traffic and com-
merce. When the truce is thus accepted, they stick up
theirjavelins and lances at the first poles, and come on un-
armed; but if any violence is offered, away they run to
their poles, take up their weapons, and then the truce is
at an end. This evening it happened that a greater num-
ber of people than usual, both men and women, traded
among usfor such toys as we had, with such great civility,
that we made us a little tent, of large boughs of trees, some
ol the men resolving to lie on shore all night; but for my
part, 1 and some others took our lodgings in the boat, with
boughs of trees spread over it, having a sail spread at the
bottom to lie upon. About two o'clock in the morning we
were awakened by the firing of muskets, and our men cry-
ing out for help, or else they would all be murdered. Scarce
had we time to get the boat a.shore, when our men came
plunging themselves into the water, with about fbur hun-
dred of the islanders at their heels. We took up seven of
the men, three of them very much wounded, and one left
behind killed, while the enemy poured their arrows so
thick among us, that we were forced to make a barricado,
with boards lying at the side of the boat, to shield us from
danger; and, having got ready our fire.arms, we returned
them a volley, which wounded several of them, as we could
hear by their cries. In this condition we lay till break of
day, and then making signals of distress to the ship, which
mv nephew the captain heard and understood, he weighed
anchor, and stood as near the shore as possible, and then
sent another boat with ten hands in her to assist us; but we
called to them not to come near, informing them of our un-
happy condition. However they ventured; when one of
the men taking the end ofa tow-line in one hand, and keep-
ing our boat between him and our adversaries, swam to us,
and slipping our cables, they towed us out of reach of their
arrows, and quickly after a broad-side was given them from
the ship, which made a most dreadful havock among them.
When we got on board, we examined into the occasion of
this fray. The men who fled informed us, that an old wo-
man, who sold milk within the poles, had brought a young
woman with her, who carried roots and herbs, the sight of
whom so much tempted our men, that they offered rude-
ness to the maid, at which the old woman set up a great cry; nor would the sailors part with their prize, but carried
her among the trees, while the old woman went, and
brought a whole army down upon them. At the beginning
of the attack, one of our men was killed with a lance, and
the fellow who began the mischief, paid dear enough for
his mistress, though as yet we did not know what had b:.-
comeofhim; the rest tuckily escaped. The third night
after the action, being curious to understand how ariairs
stood, I took the supercargo and twenty stout fellows with
me, and landed about two hours before midnight at the same
place where those Indians stood the night before, and .there
we divided our men.into two bodies, the boatswain com-
manding one, and I another. It was so dark, that we
could see nobody, neither did we hear any voice near us:
but by and by the boatswain falling over a dead body, we
agreed to halt till the moon should rise, which we knew
would be an hour after. We perceived here no fewer than
two and thirty bodies upon the ground, whereof two were
not quite dead. Satisfied with this discovery I was forgo-
ing on board again; but the boatswain and the rest told me,
they would make a visit to the Indian town, where these
dogs, so they called them, resided, asking me at the same
time to go along with them: for they did not doubt, besides
getting a good booty, but they should find Tom Jeftery
there, for that was the unhappy man we missed. But I
utterly refused to go, and commanded them back, being S..3,
unwilling to hazard their lives, as the safety of the ship
wholly depended upon them. Notwithstanding all I could
say to them, they all left me but one, and the supercargo;
so we three returned to the boat, where a boy was left, re-
solving to stay till they returned. At parting I told them
I supposed most of them would run the same fate with Tom
Jeffery. To this they replied, "Come boys, come along,
we'll warrant we'll come off safe enough;" and so away
they went notwithstanding all my admonitions, either con-
cerning their own safety or the preservation of the ship.—Indeed they were gallantly armed, every man having a
musket, bayonet, and a pistol, besides cutlasses, hangers,
pole-axes, and hand grenades. They came to a few In-
dian houses at first, which not being the town they expected,
they went farther, and finding a cow tied to a tree, they
concluded that she would be a sufficient guide, and so it
proved; for, after they untied her, she led them directly
to the town, which consisted of above two hundred houses,
several families living in some of the huts together. At
their arrival, all being in profound sleep, the sailors agreed
to divide themselves into three bodies, and set three parts
of the town on fire at once, to kill those that were escaping,
and plunder the rest of the houses. Thus desperately re-
solved, they went to work; but the first party had not
gone far btfore they called to the rest that they had found
Tom Jeffery; whereupon they all ran up to the place, and
found the poor fellow indeed hanging up naked by one
arm, and his throat almost cut from ear to ear. In a house
that was hard by the tree, they found sixteen or seventeen
Indians, who had been concerned in the fray; two or three
of them being wounded, were not gone to sleep: this house
they set on fire first, and in a few minutes after, five or six
places more in the town appeared in flames. The confla-
gration spread like wild-fire, their houses being all of wood,
and covered with flag' or rushes. The poor affrighted in-
liabihints endeavoured to run out to save their lives, but
they were driven back into the flames by the sailors, and
ki!!ed without mercy. At the first house above-mentioned,
after the boatswain had slain two with his po'e-ax, ho threw
a hand grenade into the house, which bursting, made a ter-
tibie havock, killing and wounding most of them: and their
king and most of his train, who were in that house, fell
victims to their lury, every creature of them being either smothered or burnt. All this while they never fired a gun,
least the people should awaken faster than they could over-
power them. But the fire awakened them fast enough,
which obliged our fellows to keep together in bodies. By
this time the whole town was in a flame, yet the fury ra-
ther increased, calling out to one another to remember Tom
Jeffery. The terrible light of this conflagration made me
very uneasy, and roused my nephew the captain, and the
rest of his men, who knew nothing of the matter. When
he perceived the dreadful smoke, and heard the guns go
off, he readily concluded his men were in danger; he there-
fore takes another boat, and comes ashore himself, with
thirteen men well armed. He was greatly surprised to see
me and only two men in the boat, but more so when I told
him the story: but though I urged with him, as I did
with the men, about the dangers ofthe voyage, the interests
of the merchants and owners, and the safety of the ship, yet
my nephew, like the rest, declared, that he would rather
lose the ship, his voyage, his life and all, than his men should
be lost for want of help; and so away he went. For my
part, seeing him resolved to go, I had not power to stay
behind. He ordered the pinnace back again for twelve
men more, and then we marched directly as the flame
guided us. But surely never was such a scene of horror
beheld, or more dismal cries heard, except when Oliver
Cromwell took Drogheda in Ireland, where he neither
spared man, woman, nor child.
The first object, I think, we met with, was the ruins of
one of their habitations, before which lay four men and three
women killed, and two more burnt to death among I he fire,
which was now decaying. Nothing could appear more
barbarous than this revenge; none more cruel than the
authors of it. As we went on, the fire increased, and the
cry proceeded in proportion. We had not gone much far-
ther, when we beheld three naked women, followed by six-
teen or seventeen men, flying with the greatest swiftness
from our men, who shot one of them in our sight. When
they perceived us, whom they supposed also thuir murderers,
they set up a most.dreadful shriek, and both of them swoon-
ed away in fright. This was a sight which might have
softened the hardest heart; and in pity we took some ways
to let them know we would not hurt them, while tae poor
creatures, with bended knees and lifted-up hands, made piteous lamentations to us to save their lives. I ordered
our men not to hurt any of the poor creatures whatsoever;
but being willing to understand the occasion of all this, I
went among these unhappy wretches, who neither under-
stood me nor the good I meant them. However, being
resolved to put an end to this barbarity, I ordered the men
to follow me. We had not gone fifty yards before we came
up with the boatswain, with four of our men at his heels, all
of them covered with blood and dust, and in search of more
people to satiate their vengeance. As soon as we saw them
we called out and made them understand who we were;
upon which they came up to us, setting up a halloo of tri-
umph, in token that more help was come. "Noble captain," said he to my nephew, "I'm glad you're come; we have
not half done with these villainous hellhound dogs; we'll
root out the very nation of them from the earth, and kill
more than poor Tom has hairs upon his head:" and thus he
went on till I interrupted him.—" Blood-thirsty dog," said
I, "will your cruelty never end? I charge you touch not one
creature more; stop your hands, and stand still, or you're a dead man this moment." "Why, Sir," said he, "you
neither know whom you are protecting, nor what they have
done: but pray come hither and behold an instance of
compassion, if such can merit your clemency;" and with that he showed me the poor fellow with his throat cut,
hanging upon the tree.
Indeed, here was enough to fill their breasts with rage,
which, however, I thought had gone too far, agreeable to
these words of Jacob to his sons Simeon and Levi: "Cursed
be their anger, for it was fierce; and their wrath, for it
was cruel." But this sight made my nephew and the
rest as bad as they: nay, my nephew declared, his con-
cern was only for his men; as for the people, not a soul
of them ought to live. Upon this, the boatswain and eight
more directly turned about, and went to finish the intended
tragedy; which being out of my power to prevent, I re-
turned back from the dismal sight, and the piteous cries of
those unfortunate creatures, who were made victims to their
fury. Indeed it was an egregious piece of folly in me to
return to the boat with but one attendant; and I had very
nearpaid for it, having narrowly escaped forty armed In-.
dians, who had been alarmed by the conflagration; but
having passed the place where they stood, I got to the boat accompanied with the supercargo, and so went on board,
sending the pinnace back again, to assist the men in what
might happen. When I had got to the boat, the fire was
almost extinguished, and the noise abated; but I had scarce
been half an hour on board the ship, when I heard another
volley given by our sailors, and a great smoke, which, as I
afterwards found, was our men falling upon those houses
and persons that stood between them and the sea; but here
they spared the wives and children, and killed only the men,
to the number of about sixteen or seventeen. By the time
they got to the shore, the pinnace and the ship's boat were
ready to receive them, and they all got safe on board, not
a man of them having received the least hurt, except two,
one of them having strained his foot, and the other burnt his
hand a little; for they met with no resistance, the poor
Indians being unprepared, amazed, and confounded.
I was extremely angry with every one of them, but par-
ticularly with the captain, who instead of cooling the rage
of the men had prompted them on to further mischief: nor
could he make me any other excuse, but that as he was a
man, he could not master his passions at the sight of one of
his men so cruelly" murdered. As for the rest, knowing
they were not under my command, they took no notice of
my anger, but rather boasted of their revenge. According
to all their accounts, they killed or destroyed about 150
men, women, and children, besides burning the town to
ashes. They took their companion Tom Jeffery from the
tree, covered him with some of the ruins, and so left him.
But however this action of our men might seem to them
justifiable, yet I always openly condemned it with the ap-
pellation of the Massacre of Madagascar. For though the
natives had slain this Jeffery, yet certainly he was the first
aggressor, by attempting to violate the chastity of a young
innocent woman, who ventured down to them, on the faithof
the public capitulation, which was so treacherously broken.
While we were under sail, the boatswain would often
defend his bloody action, by saying, that the Indians had
bioke the truce the night before, by shooting one of our men without just provocation: and what if the poor fellow
had taken a little liberty with the wench, he ought not to
have been murdered in so villainous a manner; and that
they had acted nothing but what the divine laws commis-
sioned to be done to such homicides. However I was in the same mind as before, telling them that they were mur-
derers, and bid them depend upon it that God would blast
their voyage, for such an unparalleled piece of barbarity.
When we came to the Gulf of Persia, five of our men,
who ventured on shore, were either killed or made slaves
by the Arabians, the rest of them having scarce time to
escape to their boat. This made me upbraid them afresb
with the retribution of Heaven for such actions; upon
which the boatswain very warmly asked me, "Whether
those men on whom the tower of Siloam fell, were greater
sinners than the rest of the Gallileans? and besides, Sir,"
said he, "none of these five poor men that are lost, were
with us at the Massacre of Madagascar, as you call it, and
therefore your representations are very unjust, andyourap-
plication improper. Besides," added he, "you are con-
tinually using the men very ill upon this account, and, be-
ing but a passenger yourself, we are not obliged to bear it;
nor can we tell what evil designs you may have to bring uj
to judgment for it in England; and, therefore, if you do
not leave this discourse, as also not concern yourself with
any of our affairs, I will leave the ship, and not sail among
such dangerous company."
All this I heard very patiently; but, it being often re-
peated, I at length told him, the concern I had on board
was none of his business; that I was a considerable owner
in the ship, and therefore had a right to speak in common,
and that I was no way accountable to him, nor any body
else. As no more passed for some time after, I thought
all had been over. At this time we were in the road of
Bengal, where, going on shore with the supercargo one day,
in the evening, as I was preparing to go on board, one of
the men came to me, and told me, I need not trouble my-
self to come to the boat, for that the cockswain and others
had ordered him not to carry me on board anymore. This
insolent message much surprised me; yet I gave him no
answer to it, but went directly and acquainted the super-
cargo, entreating him to go on board, and, by acquainting
the captain with it, prevent the mutiny which I perceived
would happen. But before I had spoke this, the matter
was effected on board; for no sooner was he gone off in
the boat, but the boatswain, gunner, carpenter, and all the
inferior officers, came to the quarterdeck, desiring to speak
with the captain; and there the boatswain made a long
harangue, exclaiming against me, as before mentioned, that
if I had not gone on shore peaceably for my own diversion,
they, by violence, would have compelled me, for their sa-
tisfaction: that as they had shipped with the Captain, so
they would faithfully serve him; but if I did not quit the
ship, or the captain oblige me to it, they would leave the
ship immediately: hereupon, turning his face about, by
way of signal, they all cried out, "ONE and ALL! ONE
and ALL!"
You may be sure, that though my nephew was a man of
great courage, yet he could not but be surprised at their
sudden and unexpected behaviour; and though he talked
stoutly to them, and afterwards expostulated with them,
that in common justice to me, who was a considerable ow-
ner in the ship, they could not turn me as it were out of my
own house, which might bring their lives in danger should
they ever be taken in England; nay, though he invited the
boatswain on shore to accommodate matters with me, yet
all this I say signified nothing; they would have nothing to
do with me; and they were resolved to go on shore if I
came on board. "Well," said my nephew, "if you are
so resolved, permit me to talk with him, and then I have
done;" and so he came to me, giving me an account of their
resolution, how one and all designed to forsake the ship
when I came on board, for which he was mightily concern-
ed. "I am glad to see you nephew," said I, "and rejoice
it is no worse, since they have not rebelled against you;
I only desire you to send my necessary things on shore,
with a sufficient sum of money, and I will find my way to
England as well as I can." Though this grieved my ne-
phew to the heart, yet there was no remedy but compliance:
in short all my necessaries were sent me, anJ'SO this matter
was over in a few hours.
I think I was now near a thousand leagues farther off
England by sea, than at my little kingdom, except this dif-
ference, that I might travel by land over the Great Mogul's
country to Surat, from thence to Bassora, bv sea up the
Persian Gulf, then take the way of the caravans over the
Arabian desert to Aleppo and Scanderoon, there take ship-
ping to Italy, and so travel by land into France, and from
thence across the sea to England.
My nephew left me two persons to attend me; one of
them was his servant, and the other clerk to the purser, 6
who engaged to be mine. I took lodgings-in an English
woman's house, where several French, one English, and two
Italian merchants resided. The Handsome entertainment
I met with here, occasioned me to stay nine months, con-
sidering what course I should take. Some English goods
I had with me of great value, besides a thousand pieces of
eight, and a letter for more, if there was such necessity.—
The goods I soon disposed of to advantage, and bought here
several good diamonds, which I could easily carry about
with me. One morning the English merchant came to me,
as being very intimate together, "Countryman," said he,
"I have a project to communicate to you, which I hope
will suit to both our advantage. To be short, Sir, we are
both in a remote part of the world from our country; but
yet in a place where men of business may get a great deal
of money. Now, if you will put a thousand pounds to my thousand pounds, we will hire a ship to our satisfaction;
you shall be captain, I will be merchant; and we'll go a
trading voyage to China, for why should we lie still like
drones, while the whole world is in a continual motion."
This proposal soon got my consent, being very agreeable
to my rambling genius; and the more so, because I looked
upon my countryman to be a very sincere person; it re-
quired some time before we could get a vessel to our mind,
and sailors to man it accordingly; at length we bought a
ship, and got an English mate, boatswain, and gunner, a
Dutch carpenter, and three Portuguese foremast-men; and,
for want of others, made shift with Indian seamen. We first
sailed to Achin, in the Island of Sumatra, and then to Siam, where we bartered our wares tor some arrack and opium,
the last of which bore a great price among the Chinese; in
a word, we went up to Suskan, making a very great voyage;
and, after eight months time I returned to Bengal, very well
satisfied with this advantage, having not only got a sufficient
quantityof money, bntaninsightofgettingagreatdeal more.
The next voyage my friend proposed to me, was to go
among the Spice Islands, and bring home a load of cloves
from the Manillas, or thereabouts; islands belonging part-
ly to Spain, but where the Dutch trade very considerably.
We were not long in preparing for this voyage, which we
made no less successful than the last, touching at Borneo,
and several other places which I do not perfectly remem-
ber, and returned home in about five months time. We soon sold our spices, which were chiefly cloves and some
.nutmegs, to the Persian merchants, who carried them away
for the Gulf; and, in short, making five to one advantage,
we were loaded with money.
Not long after my friend and I had made up our accounts,
to our entire satisfaction, there came in a Dutch coaster
from Batavia, of about two hundred tons. The crew of
this vessel pretended themselves so sickly, that there were
not hands sufficient to undertake a voyage; and the captain having given out that he intended to go to Europe, public
notice was given that the ship was to be sold. No sooner
did this come to our ears, but we bought the ship, paid the
master, and took possession. We would also have very
willingly entertained some of the men; but they having
received their share of booty, were not to be found, being
altogether fled to Agra, the great city o( the Mogul's resi-
dence: and from thence went to travel to Surat, and so by
the sea to the Persian Gulf. And indeed they had reason
to fly in this manner; for the truth of it was, the pretended
captain was the gunner only, and not the commander;
that having been on a trading voyage, they were attacked
on the shore by the Malayans, who killed three men and
the captain; after whose death the other eleven men run
away with the ship to the Bay of Bengal, and left the mate
and five men more on shore; but of this affair we shall
have occasion to speak more at length hereafter.
However they came by the ship, we thought we bought
it honestly: neither did we suspect any thing of the matter;
when the man showed us a bill of sale for the ship (undoubt-
edly forged) to one EmanuelClostershoven, which name he
went by. And so without any more to do, we picked up
some Dutch and English seamen, resolving for another voy-
age for cloves among the Philippine and. Molucca islands:
in short, we continued thus five or six years, trading from
port to port with extraordinary success. In the seventh
year, we undertook a voyage to China, designing to touch
at Siam, and buy some rice by the way. In this voyage
contrary winds beat us up and down for a considerable time
among the Islands in the Straits of Molucca. No sooner
were we clear of those rugged seas, but we perceived
our ship had sprung a leak, which obliged us to put into the
river Cambodia, which lies northward of the Gulf, and
goes up to Siam.
T
One day, as I was on shore refreshing myself, there
came to me an Englishman, who was gunner's mate on
board an English East-India ship, riding up the river near
the city of Cambodia: "Sir," said he, "you may wonder
at my business, having never seen me in your life; but tho'
] am a stranger, I have something to tell you that very near-
ly concerns you; and indeed it is the imminent danger you
are in has moved me to give you this timeiv notice."—
"Danger!" said I, "what danger? I know of none, ex-
cept my .•.hip being leaky, for which I design to have her
run agicunri to.morrow morning." "I hope you will be
better employed when you shall hear what I have to say to
you. You know the town of Cambodia is about fifteen
leagues up this ri\er; about three leagues on this side of it,
there lie two Dutch and three English ships. And would
vent venture here without considering what strength you
have to engage them?" I knew not what he meant by this
discourse, and turning short upon him, "Sir," said 1, "I
know no reason I have to be afraid either of any Dutch or
English ships. I am no interloper, and what business have
they with me:" "Well, Sir," said the man, "if you do
think yourself secure, all as I-can say, you must take your
chance; however I am very sorry you are so deaf to good
advice; but I assure you, if you do not put to sea immedi-
ately, you will be attacked by five long-boats full of men,
hanged for a pirate, if you are taken, and the par-
ticulars examined afterwards. I thought, Sir," added
he, " I might have met a better reception for such a singu-
lar piece of service." "Sir," said I, "I never was un-
grateful to any man; but pray explain yourself, and I'll go
on board this minute, whether the leak be stopped or no."
"Why, Sir," said he, "to be short, because time is precious,
the matter is this: you know well enough that you was
with the ship at Sumatra, when your captain was murdered
by the Malayans, with three of his sailors; and that either
you, or some who were on board you, ran away with the
ship, and are since turned pirates at sea. Now, Sir, this
is the sum of what I had to say; and I can positively assure
you, that if you are taken, you will be executed without
much ceremony, for undoubtedly you cannot but be sen-
sible what little law merchant ships show to pirates, when-
ever they fall into their hands."
"Sir," said F, "1 thank you for your kind information;
and though I am sure no man coukl couie more honest!/
by the ship than I have done, yet knowing their enterprize,
and being satisfied of your honest intention, I'll be upon my
defence." "Pr'ythee, Sir," said the man, "don't talk of
being upon your defence, the best that you can make is to
be out of danger; and therefore if you have any regard for
your life, and the lives of your men, take the advantage,
without fail of putting out to sea at high-water: by which
means, as you have a whole tide before you, you will be gone
too far out of their reach before they can come down."
"I am mightily well satisfied,'' said I, " in this p.articu!ar;
and for your kindness, which merits my great esteem, pray,
Sir, what amends shall I makevou ?" he replied, " I know
not what amends you are willing to make, because you
may have seme doubts of its certainty: but, to convince
you of the truth of what I say, I have one offer to make to
you. On board one of the English ships, I have nineteen
months pay due to me, and this Dutchman that is with me,
has seven months pay due to him, which if you will make
good to us, we will go along with you. If you shall tind
that there is nothing in what we have said, then we shall
desire nothing; but when you are convinced that we have
saved the ship, your life, and the lives of the men, we will
leave the'whole to your generosity."
So reasonable did this every way appear, that I immedi-
ately consented, and we went directly on board. As soon
as we came on board, my partner calls joyfully out, "That
they had stopped the leak!" " Well, thank God," said I
"but pray let us weigh anchor forthwith."—"Weigh!"
said he, "what is the meaning of this hurry r" "Fray ask
no questions," said I, "but all hands to work, without
losing a moment's time." Upon which, in great surprise,
the Ci'ptain wascal'ed, who immediately ordered the anchor
to be got up; and though the tide was not quite down,
yet being assisted with a little land breeze, we stood to sea.
I then called to mv partner into the cabin, and related the
story at large, which was confirmed and more amplified by
the two men I had brought on board. Scarce had wu
finished our discourse upon this head, but a sailor came to
the cabin door, with a message from the captain, that we were chased by five sloops full of armed men. "Very
well," said I, "it is plain now there is something in it."—And so, going upon deck, I told all the men there was a T •2
design for seizing the ship, and of executing us for pirates;
and asked them whether they would faithfully stand by us,
and by one another?" to which they unanimously replied)
"That they would fight to their last drop of blood." I
then asked the captain, which way he thought best for us
to manage the battle? "Sir," said he, "the only method
is to keep them off with our great shot as long as we are
able, and then have recourse to our small arms; and when
both these fail us, then retire to close quarters, when perhaps the enemy, wanting materials, can neither break open
our bulk heads, nor get in upon us." Mean time the gun-
ner was ordered to bring two guns to bear fore and aft out
of the steerage, and so load them with musket-bullets and
small pieces of old iron; and the deck being cleared, we
prepared for the engagement, still, however, keeping out
at sea. The boats followed us with all the sail they could
make, and we could perceive the two foremost were Eng-
Iish, which outsailed the rest by two leagues, and which we
found would come up with us: hereupon, we fired a gun
without a ball, intimating that they should bring to, and we
put out a flag of truce, as a signal for parley; but rinding
them crowding after uc, til! they came within shot, we took
in our white, and hanging out the red flag, immediately
fired at them with ball: we then called to them with a
speaking trumpet, bidding them at their peril keep off.'
But all this signified nothing; for depending upon the
strength that followed them, they were resolutely bent for
mischief: hereupon I ordered them to bring the ship to, by
which means, they lying upon our broadside, we let fly at
them at once, one of whom carried away the stern of the
hindermost boat, and obliged them not only to take down
their sail, but made them all run to the head of the boat, to
keep her from sinking, and so she lay by, having enough
of it. In the mean time, we prepared to welcome the fore-
most boat in the same manner. While we were doing this,
one of the three hindermost boats came up to the relief of
that which was disabled and took the men out of her. We
again called to parley with them•; but, instead of an answer,
one of the boats came close under our stern; whereupon
our gunner let ily his two chase guns, but missing, the men
in the boat shouted, and waving their caps, came on with
greater fury. To repair this seeming disgrace, the gunner
soon got ready, and firing a second time, did a great deal of mischief among the enemy. We waved again, and, bring-
ing our quarter to bear upon them, fired three guns more,
when we found the boat a sinking, and several men already
in the sea; hereupon, manning our pinnace, I gave orders
to save as many as they could, and instantly to come on
board, because the rest of their boats were approaching:
accordingly they did so, and took up three of them, one of
whom was almost past recovery; and then crowding all the sail we could, after our men came on boa'rd, we stood out
farther to sea, so that the other three boats gave over the chase, when they came up to the first two. Thus delivered
from imminent danger, we changed our course to the east-
-ward, quite out of the course of all European ships.
Being now at sea, and inquiring more particularly of the
two seamen the meaning of all this, the Dutchman at once
let us into the secret. He told us, that the fellow who sold
'us the ship was an arrant thief, who had run away with her;
that the captain was treacherously murdered on the coast
of Molucca by the natives there, with three of his men;
that he, the Dutchman, and four more, being obliged to
have recourse to the woods for their safety, at length escaped
by means of a Dutch ship, in its way to China, which had
sent their boat on shore for fresh water: that, after this,
he went to Batavia, where two of the seamen belonging to
the ship (who had deserted the rest in their travels) arrived, and there gave an account that the• fellow who ran away
with the ship had sold her at Bengal to a set of pirates, who went a cruising, and had already taken one English and
two Dutch ships richly laden.
Now though this was absolutely false, my partner truly
said, that our deliverance was to be esteemed so much the
more, by reason, had we fallen into their hands, we could
have expected nothing from them but immediate death,
considering our accusers would have been our judges; and,
therefore, his opinion was to return directly to Bengal,
where, being known, we could prove how honestly we came
by the^ship, of whom we bought her, and the like, and
where we were sure of some justice; at least would not be
hanged first and judged afterwards. I was at first of my
partner's opinion, but when I had more seriously consider- -
ed of the matter, I told him, we ran a great hazard in at-
tempting to return, being on the wrong side of the Straits .
T3 .
of Molucca, and that, if, upon alarm given, we should be
taken by the Dutch at Batavia, or English elsewhere, our
running away would be a sufficient evidence to condemn us.
This danger indeed startled not only my partner, but like-
wise all the ship's company; so we changed our former re-
solution, and resolved to go to the coast of Tonquin, and
so to that of China, where, pursuing our first design as to
trade, we might likewise have an opportunity to dispose of
the ship some way or other, and to return to Bengal in any
country vessel we could procure. This being agreed to,
we steered away N.N. E. about 50 leagues off the usual
course to the east, which put us to some inconveniences.
As the wind blew steadily against us, our voyage became
more tedious, and we began to be afraid of want of provi-
sion? and what was still worse, we apprehended, that as
those ships, from whose boats we had escaped, were bound
to China, they might get before us, and have given fresh
information, which might create another vigorous pursuit.
Indeed, I could not help being grieved, when I considered
that I who had never wronged or defrauded any person in
my life, was now pursued like a common thief, and, if taken,
to run the greatest danger of being executed as such; and,
though innocent, I found myself under the necessity of fly-
ing tor my safety; and thereby escape being brought to
shame, of which I was even more afraid than of death itself.
It was easy to read my dejection in my countenance. My
mind was oppressed, like those unhappy, innocent persons,
who being overpowered by blasphemous and perjured evi-
dences, wickedly resolved to take away their lives, or ruin
their reputation, have no other recourse in this world to
ease their sorrow, but sighs, prayers, and tears. My partner
seeing me so concerned, encouraged me as well as he could;
and after describing to me the several ports of that coast,
he told me, he would either put me in on the coast of Co-
ching China, or else in the Bay ofTonquin, from whence we
might go to Macao, a town once possessed by the Portu-
guese, and where still many European families resided.
To this place we steered, and early next morning came
in sight of the coast; but thought it advisable to put into
a small river where we could, either overland, or by the
ship's pinr.ace, know what vessels were in any ports there-
vb'iuts. This happy step proved our deliverance; for, nest
g, there came to the ijay of Tonquin two Dutcli
ships, and a third, without any colours; and in the evening
two English ships steered the same course. The river
where we were was but small, and run but a few leagues up
the country northward; the country was wild and barbarous
and the people thieves, having no correspondence with any
other nation; dealing only in fish, oil, and such gross com-
modities; and one barbarous custom they still retained, that
when any vessel was unhappily shipwrecked upon their
coast, they make the men prisoners or slaves; so that now
we might fairly say we were surrounded by enemies both
by sea and land.
As the ship had been leaky, we took the opportunity, in
this place, to search her, and to stop up the places which
let in the water. We accordingly lightened her, and bring-
ing our guns and other moveable things to one side, we assayed to bring her down, that we might come to her bot-
tom; but upon second consideration, we did not think it
safe to let her lie on dry ground, neither indeed was the
place convenient for it. The inhabitants, not used to such
a sight as to sec a^ship lie down on one side, and heel in to-
wards the shore, and not perceiving the men, who were at
work on her bottom, with stages and boats on the off-side,
presently imagined the ship had been cast away, and lay
fast on the ground. Agreeable to this supposition, they
surrounded us with ten or twelve large boats, with a reso-
lution, undoubtedly, to plunder the ship, and carry away
those they found alive for slaves to their king. But when
they perceived our men hard at work on the ship's bottom
and side, washing, graving, and stopping her, it rill«d them
all with such surprise, that they stood gazing as though they
were confounded. Nor could we imagine what their de-
sign was; however, for fear of danger, we handed down
arms and ammunition to those at work, in order to defend
themselves; and, indeed, this precaution was absolutely
necessary; for, in a quarter of an hour after, the natives,
concluding it was really a shipwreck, and that we were sa-
ving our lives and goods, which they thought belonged to
them, came down upon our men, as though it had been in
line of battle. We lay at present but in a very unfit posture
to fight; and before the stages could be got down, or the
men in the boat come on board as they were ordered, the
Cochin Chinese were upon them, and two of their boats
boarding our long-boat, they began to lay hold of our mc;n
as prisoners. The first they seized was a stout English
sailor, who never fired his musket, like a fool as I imagined,
but laid it down in the boat: but he knew what he was
doing; for by main force, he dragged the Pagan out of the
boat into ours by the two ears, and knocked his brains out
against the boat's gunnel; a Dutchman that was next him
snatched up the musket, and knocked down five more with
the butt-end of it; however this was doing very little to their number; but a strange unexpected accident, which
rather merits laughter than any thing else, gave our men a
complete victory over them.
It seems the carpenter, who was preparing to grave the
outside of the ship, as well as to pay the seams, where he
caulked to stop the leaks, had gotten two kettles just let
down in the boat, one filled with boiling pitch, and the
other with rosin, tallow, oil, and such stuff as the ship-
wrights use; the carpenter's man had a great iron ladle
with which he used to supply the workmen with hot stuff,
and as two of the enemies entered the boat where the fel-
low stood, he saluted them with a full'ladle of the hot boil-
ing liquor, which, the poor creatures being half naked, made
them roar out, and jump into the sea. "Well done, Jack,"
says the carpenter, "give them the other dose;" and so
stepping forward himself, takes a mop, and dipping it into
the pitch pot, he and his man so plentifully flung it among
them, as that none escaped being scalded; upon which they
all made the best of their way, crying and howling in such
a frightful manner, that, in all my adventures, I never heard
the like. And, indeed, never was I better pleased with
any conquest than I was with this, there being so little
bloodshed, and having an aversion to killing such savage wretches, (more than was necessary) as knowing they came
on errands, which their law and customs made them think
were just and equitable. By this time, all things being in
order, and the ship swimming, they found their mistake, so
they did not venture a second attack. Thus ended our
merry fight; and having got rice, bread, roots, and sixteen
good hogs on board the day before, we set sail, not daring
to go into the bay of Tonquin, but steered N. E. toward
the island of Formosa, or as tho' we would go to the Ma-
nillas, or Philippine islands, for fear of meeting with any
European ships; when we anchored at the isle of Formosa,
the inhabitants not only courteously supplied us with provisions G .
Visions and fresh water, but dealt very fairly and honestly
with us in their bargains and agreements. From this place
we steered north, keeping still off the coast of China, till
we were beyond all its ports where European ships usually
come; and, at length, being come to the latitude of thirty
degrees, we resolved to.put into the first trading port we
should come at j and standing for the shore, a boat came off
two leagues to us, with an old Portuguese pilot on board,
who offered his service; we very gladly accepted him, and
sent the boat back again. And now, having the old man
on board, I talked to him of going to Nanquin, the most
northward part of the coast of China. "What will you do
there?" said he, smiling. I told him we would sell our
cargo, and purchase calicoes, raw and wrought silks, tea,
&c. and so return the same way back. "O," said he, "you
had better put in at Macao, where you may buy China wares
as cheap as at Nanquin, and sell your opium at a greater
advance." "But," said I, "we are gentlemen, as well as
merchants, and design to see the great cityofPekin, and
the magnificent court of the monarch of China." "Why,
then," said he, "you should go to Ningpo, where there is
a navigable river that goes through the heart of that vast
empire, two hundred and seventy leagues from the sea,
which crosses all the rivers, passes considerable hills, by
the help of the sluices and gates, and goes even up to the
city of Pekin. You may go to Nanquin, if you please, and
travel to Pekin, and there is a Dutch ship just before bound
that way." At the name ofa Dutch or English ship, I was
struck with confusion; they being as great a terror to me in this vessel, as an Algerine man of war is to them in the
Meuiterran!.an. The old man finding me troubled, "Sir,"
said. he, "I hope the Dutch are not now at war with your
nation." "No," said 1, "but God knows what liberty they
may take when out of the reach of the law." "Why," says he, "what occasion is there for peaceable merchants to fear?
for believe me, they never meddle with any but PIRATES 'f
At the mentioning the word Pirates, my countenance
turned to that of scarlet; nor was it possible forme to con-
ceal it from the old pilot; who taking notice of it, "Sir,"
said he, " take what course you please, I'll do you all the
service I can." "Seignior," said I, "I am a little con-
cerned at your mentioning pirates; I hope there are none
such in these seas, because you see in what weak condition we are to defend ourselves." "O, Sir," said he, " if that's
all, don't be concerned; I don't remember one in these seas
these fifteen years, except about a month ago, one was seen
in the bay of Siam, but he is gone to the southward; nei-
ther was she built for a privateer, but was run away with
by a reprobate captain, and some of his men, the right
captain having been murdered by the Malayans."
"What \" said I, (as though ignorant of what had hap-
pened) " did they kill the Captain i" " No,"said he, " it n
generally thought the Malayans murdered him; but perhaps
they might procure them to do.it, and therefore they justly
deserve hanging. The rogues were lately discovered in
the Bay of Siam, in the river of Cambodia, by some Dutch-
men who belonged to the ship, and had much ado to escape
the five boats that pursued them, but they have solemnly
sworn to give no quarter to the captain or the seamen, but
hang them every one up at the yard-arm, without any formal
business of bringing them to a court of judicature."
Being sensible, that, having the old man on board, he
was incapable of doing me any mischief, "Well, Seignior,"
said I, "it is for this very reason I would have you carry
us up to Nanquin, where neither English nor Dutch ships
come; and I must tell you, their captains are a parcel of
rash, proud, insolent rascals, that neither know what belongs
to justice, nor how to behave themselves as the laws of God
or nature direct; follows that would prove murderers to
punish robbers, and take upon them to adjudge innocent
men to death, without any proof to prove them guilty; bat
perhaps I may live to call them to account for it, in a place
where they may be taught how justice is to be executed."
And so 1 told him all the story of buying the ship, and how
we were saved by the means of two men: that the murder
of the Captain by the Malayans, as also the running away
with the ship, I believed to be true; but that we, who
bought it, were turned pirates, was a mere fiction, to cover
their cowardice and foolish behaviour, when they attacked
us; and the blood of those men we killed in our own just de-
fence lay at their door, who were sent to attack us by surprise.
"Sir," said the old man amazed, "you have taken the
right course to steer to the north, and if I might advise
you, I would have you sell your ship in China, and buy or
build another in that country; and I'll procure people to
buy the one and sell the other." "Well, but Seignior,"
said I, "if I sell the ship in this manner, I may bring some
innocent persons into the same dangers I have gone through,
perhaps worse, even death itself; whereby I should be as
guilty of their murder as their villanous executioners."—
"That need not trouble you," says the old man, " I'll find
a way to prevent that; for these commanders, you talk of,
I know very well, and will inform them rightly of the mat-
ter as you have related, and I am persuaded they will not
only believe me, but act more cautiously for the future."—
"And will you deliver one message from me to them -"
"Yes," said he, "if you will give it under your hand, that
I may prove it is not of my own production." Hereupon
I wrote a large account of their attacking me in their long-
-boat, the pretended reason and unjust design of it; that
they had done what they might be ashamed of, and could
not answer for at any tribunal in England. But this letter
was writ in vain. Providence ordered things another way.
We sailed directly for Nanquin, and in about thirteen days
sail, came to an anchor at the south-west point of the great
gulf of that place, where we learned, that two Dutch
ships were gone the length before us, and that we should
certainly fall into their hands. We were all at a great loss
in this exigency, and would very gladly have been on shore
almost any where; but our old pilot told me, that if I
would sail to the southward about two and forty leagues,
there was a little port called Quinchange, where no Euro-
pean ships ever came, and where we might consider what
was further to be done. Accordingly we weighed anchor
the next day, calling only twice on shore by the way to
get fresh water. The country people very courteously
sold us roots, tea, rice, fowls, and other provisions. After
five days sail we came to the port, and landed with unspeak-
able joy. We resolved to dispose of ourselves and effects
in any other way possible, than enteron board that ill-fated
vesset more; lor no state can be more miserable than a
continued fear, which is a life of death, a confounder of
our understandings, that sets the imagination at work to
form a thousand frightful things that may never happen.
And we scarce slept one night, withoutdreaming of halters,
yard arms', or gibbets, of fighting, being taken, and being
killed; nay, so violent were our apprehensions, that we
would bruise our hands and heads against the sides of the
cabin, as though actually engaged. The story of the Dutch cruelty at Amboyna, often came into our thoughts when
awake; and for my part, I thought my condition very
hard, that after so many difficulties and such signal deliver-
ances, I should be hanged in my old age, though innocent
of any crime that deserved such punishment; but then re-
ligion would seem to represent to me, as though the voice
of it had said, consider, O man! what sins you have been
formerly guilty of; which now thou art called to an account
for, to expiate with thy blood! and as to thy innocence,
what art thou more innocent than thy blessed redeemer Jesus Christ, who suffered for thy offences, and to whose
providence you ought to submit, let what will happen?
after this, natural courage would inspire me to resist to
the last drop of blood, and sooner die than suffer myself to
be taken by boorish, rascally Dutchmen, who had arts to
torment beyond death itself.
But now, thank kind heaven, being ashore, our old pilot
procured us a lodging and warehouse for our goods; it
was a little hut, with a large warehouse joining to it, all
built with canes, and pallisadoed round with large ones, to
keep out pilfering thieves, which are very numerous in that
country. The magistrates allowed us a little guard during
the night, and we employed a centinel with a kind of hal-
bert for threepence a day. The fair, or mart, we found
had been over for some time; however, there remained in
the river four junks and two Japan ships, the merchants of
the latter being on shore. In the first place, our old pilot
brought us acquainted with the missionary Roman priests,
who were converting the people to Christianity: two of
them were reserved, rigid, and austere, applying themselves
to the work they came about with great earnestness; but
the third, who was a Frenchman, called Father Simeon, was
of a freer conversation, not seemingly so serious and grave,
vet no worse Christian than the other two, 'one of whom
was a Portuguese, and thuother a Genoese. Father Simeon,
it seems, was appointed to go to Pekin, the royal seat of the emperor of the Chinese; and he only waited for ano-
ther priest, who was ordered from Macao to accompany
him. We never met together, but he was prompting me
to accompany' him in that journey: "Sir," said he, "I
will show you the glorious things of this mightv empire,
and a city,.the city of Pekin, far exceeding London and
Paiis, jnit them both together. One day in particular, be-
ing at dinnerwith him, I showed some inclination to go;
which made him press the more upon me and my partner,
to gain our perfect consent. "But, Father Simeon," said
my partntir, " what satisfaction can you have in our com-
pany whom you esteem as heretics, and consequently objects
not worthy your regard?" "O," said he," you may be as
good Catholics in time as those I hope to convert to our
religion." "And so,'' said I, "we shall have you preach-
ing to us all the way, instead of pleasing us with a descrip-
tion of the country." "Sir," said he, "however our reli-
gion may be villified by some people, it is very certain it
neither divests us of good manners or Christian charity;
and as we are gentlemen, as such we may converse toge-
ther, without making one another uneasy."
But we shall leave him awhile, to consider our ship and
the merchandise which we had to dispose of. There was
but very little trade in the place where we were; and I
was once resolved to venture to sail to the river Kilam, and
so to the city of Nanquin; but Providence ordered it other-
wise, by our old pilot's bringing a Japan merchant to us, to
see what goods we had. He immediately bought our opium,
for which he gave us a very good price in gold by weigh),
some wedges of which were about ten or eleven ounces.
It came into my head that perhaps he might buy the ship
too; and I ordtred his interpreter to propose it to him.—He said nothing then, but shrugged up his shoulders; yet
in a few days after he came, accompanied by a missionary
priest, who was his interpreter, with this proposal, "That
as he had bought a great quantity of our goods, he had not
money enough to purchase our ship; but if I pleased he
would hire her, with all my men, to go to Japan, and from
thence with another loading to the Philippine islands, the
freight of which he would very willingly pay to us before;
and at their return to Japan, would buy the ship." Upon
this we asked the captain and his men, if they were willing
to go to Japan; to which they unanimously agreed. While
this was in agitation, the young man my nephew left to
attend me, told me, "That as I did not care to accept this
prospect of advantage, he would manage it for me as I
pleased, and render me a faithful account of his success,
which would be wholly mine." Indeed I was very unwil-
ling to part with him; but considering it might be for the young man's good, I discoursed with my partner about it,
who of his own generosity, gave him his share of the vessel,
so that I could do no otherwise than give him mine: but,
however we let him have but the proper half of it, and
preserved a power, that when we met in England if he
had obtained success, he should account to us for one half of
the profits of the ship's freight, and the other should be his
own. Thus having taken a writing under his hand, away
he sailed to Japan, where the merchant dealt very honestly
by him, got him a licence to come on shore, sent him loaded
to the Philippines with a Japanese supercargo, from whence
he came back again loaded with European goods, cloves, and
other spices. By this voyage he cleared a considerable
sum of money, which determined him not to sell his ship,
but to trade on his own account; so he returned to the Ma-
nillas, where, getting acquaintance, he made his ship free,
was hired by the governor privately to go to Acapulco in
America, on the Mexican coast, with a licence to travel to
the great city of Mexico. This traffic turned out greatly
to account, and my friend finding means to get to Jamaica, returned nine years after exceedingly rich into England.
In parting with the ship, it comes in course to consider
of those men who had saved our lives when in the river of
Cambodia; and though, by the way, they were a couple of
rogues, who thought to turn pirates themselves, yet we
paid them what they had before demanded, and gave each
of them a small sum of money, making the Englishman a
gunner, and the Dutchman a boatswain, with which they
were very well contented.
We were now about 1000 leagues fart her from home,
than when at Bengal.. All the comfort we could expect
was, that there being another fair to be kept in a month's
time, we might not only purchase all sons of that country's
manufactures, hut very possibly find some Chinese junks,
or vessels from Tonquin, to be sold, which would carry us
and our goods wheresoever we pleased. Upon these hopes,
we resolved to continue; and to divert ourselves, we took
several little journies in the country. About ten days after
we parted with our ship, we travelled to see the city oi'
Kanquin. The city lies in latitude 30 degrees^ north o&he
line: it is regularly built, and the streets are exactly straight,
Hi.d cross ore another in direct lines, which sets it out to
the greatest advantage. At our return, we found the priest was come from Macao, that was to accompany father Si-
meon to Pekin. That father earnestly solicited me to ac-
company him, and i referred him to my partner. In short,
we both agreed, and prepared accordingly; and we were
so lucky as to have liberty to travel among the retinue of
one of their Mandarines, who is a principal magistrate, and
much reverenced by the people.
We were five and {wen tv day stravelling through this miser-
able country, infinitely populous, but as indifferently cul-
tivated; and yet their pride is infinitely greater than their
poverty, insomuch that the priests themselves deride them.
As we passed by the house of one of their country gentle-
men, two leagues off Nanquin, we had the honour, forsooth,
-to ride with the Chinese squire about two miles. Never
was Don Quixote so exactly imitated! never such a com-
pound of pomp and poverty seen before 1
His habit, made of calico, was dirty, greasy, and very
proper for a Merry Andrew or Scaramouch, with all its
tawdry trappings, as hanging sleeves, tassels, &c. though
torn and rent in almost every part; his vest underneath it
was no less dirty, but more greasy, resembling the most ex-
quisite sloven or greasy butcher: his horse (worse than Ro-
sinante, or the fumous steed of doughty Hudibras) was a
poor starved, decrepid thing, that would not sell for thirty
shillings in England; and yet this piece of worshipful pomp
was attended with ten or twelve slaves who guarded their
master to his country seat. We stopped at a little village
for refreshment; and when we came by the country-seat of
this great man, we found him sitting under a tree before his
door, eating a mess of boiled rice, with a great piece of
garlic in the middle, and a bag filled with green pepper by
him, and another plant like ginger, together with a piece
of lean mutton in it: this was his worship's repast: but
pray observe the state of the food ', two women slaves brought
him his food, which being laid before him, two others ap-
peared to perform their respective offices; one fed him
with a spoon, while the other scraped off what fell upon his
beard and taffety vest, and gave it to a particular favourite
to eat. And thus we left the wretch pleased with the con-
ceit ofour admiring his magnificence, which rather merited
our scorn and detestation.
At length we arrived at the great city of Pekin, accom-
panied by two servants, and the old Portuguese pilot, whose U2
charges we bore, and who served us as an interpreter by
the way. We had scarce been a week at Pekin, but he
comes laughing to us, "Ah! Seignior Inglise," said he,
"me something tell you make your heart glad, but make
me sorry; for you bring me here twenty-five days journey,
and now you leave me go back alone j and which way
shall I make my port after, without de ship, without de
horse, without pecune I" so he called money in his broken
Latin. He then informed me, that there was a great ca-
ravan of Muscovite and Polish merchants in the city, who
were preparing to set out for Muscovy by land within six
weeks; and, that he was certain we would take this oppor-
tunity, and consequently that he must gohome by himself.
Indeed this news infinitely surprised and pleased me.—
"Are you certain of this ?" said I. "Yes, Sir," says he,
"me sure it's true." And so he told me that having met
an old acquaintance of his, an Armenian, in the street, who
was among them, and who had come from Astracan, with
a design to go to Tonquin, but for certain reasons having
altered his resolutions, he was now resolved to go with the
caravan, and to return by the river Wolga to Astracan.—
"Well, Seignior," said 1, "don't be discontented about
your returning alone: and if, by this means, I can find a
passage to England, it will be your own fault if you return
to Macao at all." And so consulting with my partner what
was best to be done, he referred it to me as I pleased, hav-
ing our affairs so well settled at Bengal, that, if he could
convert the good voyage he had made in China silks,
wrought or raw, he would be satisfied to go to England,
and so return to Bengal in the company's ships. Thus re-
solved, we agreed that if our pilot would go with us, we
would bear his charges either to Moscow or England; and
to give him in a present the sum of one hundred and seventy
pounds sterling. Hereupon we called him in, and told
him the cause of his complaint should be removed, if he
would accompany us with the caravans; and, therefore, we
desired to know his mind. At this he shook his head,
"Great long journey," said he, "me no pecune carry me
to Moscow, or keep me there." But we soon put him out
of that concern, by making him sensible of what we would
give him here to lay out to the best advantage; and, as for
his charges, we would set him sale on shore, God willing,
either in Muscovy or England, as he pleased, at our own charge, except the carriage of his goods. At this proposal,
he was like a man transported, telling us, he would go with
us all the world over; and we made preparations for our
journey; but it was near four months before all the mer-
chants were ready.
In the mean time, my partner and the pilot went express
to the port where me first put in, to dispose of what goods
had been left there, while I accompanied a Chinese mer-
chant who was going to Nanquin, and there bought twenty-
nine pieces of damask, with about three hundred more of
other fine silks; and by the time my partner returned to
Pekin, I had them all carried thither; our cargo in silks
amounted to 4-5001. sterling, which, together with tea, fine
calicoes, nutmegs, and cloves, loaded eighteen camels for
our share, besides what we rode upon, with two or three
spare horses, and two more loaded with provisions; the
company now was very great, making about four hundred
horse, and above one hundred and twenty men, well armed and provided. We were of several nations, among whom
were five Scotch merchants, inhabiting in Moscow, and
well experienced in trade.
We set out from Pekin the beginning of February, our.
style; and in two days inore, We passed through the gate
of the great China wall, which was erected as a fortifica-
tion against the Tartars, being one hundred English miles
Iong. We then entered a country not near so populous,
chiefly under the power of plundering Tartars, several com-
panies of whom we perceived riding on poor starved horses,
contemptible as themselves, without order or discipline.—One time our leader, for the day gave us leave to go a hunting; but what do you think we hunted r only a parcel
of sheep, which indeed exceeded any in the world for wildness and swiftness; but while we were pursuing this game, it was our chance to meet with about forty Tartars, who
no sooner perceived us, but one of them blew a horn,.at
the sound of which there soon appeared a troop of forty or
fifty more, at about a mile's distance. Hereupon one of the Scotch merchants (who knew their ways) ordered us to
advance towards them, and attack them immediately. As
we advanced, they let fly a volley of arrows, which happi'y.
fell a little short of us; this made us halt a little, to return
the compliment with bullets; and then being led up by U J
the bold Scot, we fired our pistols in their faces, and drew
'nitour swords; but there was no occasion; for they flew
like timorous sheep, and only three of them remained,
beckoning to the rest to come back. But our brave com-
mander gallopped up to them by himself, shot one dead,
knocked another off' his horse, while the third ran away;
and thus ended our battle with the Tartars. We travelled a month more through the Emperor of
China's dominions; and at length coming to one of their
towns about a day and a half's journey from the city of
Naum, I wanted to buy a camel. The person 1 spoke to
would have brought me one, but, like a fool, I must go
along with him, about two miles from the village. My
old pilot and I walked on foot, forsooth, for some variety,
vi hen coming to the place where the camelswere kept as
in a park guarded by Chinese soldiers, ve there agreed
and bought one, which the Chinese man that came along
with me led along the road. But we had not gone far, be-
fore we were attacked by five Tartars, mounted on horse-
hack, two of whom seized the man, took the camel from
him, and rode awa\, while the other three approached us, the first of whom suddenly seized me as I was drawing my
sword, the second knocked me down, but my old trusty
Portuguese, taking a pistol out of his pocket, which I knew
nothing of, and coming up to the fellow that struck me, he
with one hand pulled him offhis horse, and then shot him
dead upon the spot; then taking his scymitar, he struck
at the man that stopped us, but missing him, cutoff one of
his horse's ears, the pain of which made him throw his
rider to the ground. The poor Chinese who had led the
camel, seeing the Tartar down, runs to him, and seizing
upon his pole-ax, wrenched it from his hands, and knocked
his brains out. But there was another Tartar to deal with,
who seeming neither inclined to fight nor fiy, and my old
man having begun to charge his pistol, the sight of it struck
such a terror into the wretch, that away he scoured, leav-
ing my old pilot, rather my champion and defender, an
absolute victory.
By this time being awakened from my trance, I began
to open n y eves, wondering where I was, having quite
forgot all thai gassed; but my senses returning, and feeling
a great pain in my head, and seeing the blood was running
over my clothe?, i insiar.tly jumped upon my lett, ar.J
grasped my sword in my hand, with a resolution to take re-
venge: but no enemies now remained, except the dead
Tartar, with his horse standing by him. The old man
seeing me recovered, whom he thought slain, ran towards
me, and embraced me with the greatest tenderness, at the
same time examining into my wound, which was far from
being mortal. When we returned to the village, the man
demanded payment for his camel, which I refusing, we
brought the cause before a Chinese judge, who acted with
great impartiality: having heard both sides, he asked the
Chinese man that went with me, whose servant he was?
"Sir," said he, "I am nobody's, bat went with the stran-
ger at his request:" " Why then," said the judge, "you
are the stranger's servant for the time, and the camel be-
ing delivered to his servant, it is the same as though de-
livered to himself, and accordingly he must pay for it."—Indeed the case was so fairly stated, that I had nothing ip
object to it; so having paid for that I was robbed of, I sent for another, but did not go myself to fetch it, as I had
enough of that sport before.
The city of Naum is a frontier of the Chinese Empire, so
fortified, as some will tell you, that millions of Tartars cannot batter down their walls; by which certainly one might
think one of our cannons would do more execution than'all
their legions.
When we were within a day's march of that city, we
had information that the governor had sent messengers to
every part of the road, to inform the travellers and caravans
to halt, till a guard was sent to protect them from the nu-
merous bodies of Tartars that lately appeared about the
city. This news put us into great consternation: but
obeying the orders, we stopt; and two days after, there
came two hundred soldiers from a garrison of the Chinese,
and three hundred more from Naum; thus guarded both
in the front and rear, with our own men in the flanks, we
boldly advanced, thinking we were able to combat with
ten thousand Mogul Tartars, if they appeared.
Early next.morning, in our march from a little well situ-
ated town called Changu, after having passed a river and
entered upon a desert of about fitte. n or sixteen mi:es over
we soon beheld, by a cloud of dust that was raised, that
the enemy was approaching. This much dispirited the
Chinese. My old pilot took notice of it, and culled out
"Seignior Inglise, those fellows must be encouraged, or thej
wjll ruin us all; and I am afraid if the Tartars attack us,
they will all run away." "Why, Seignior," said I, "what
shall be done in this case?" "Done," says he, "why let
fifty of our men advance, and flank them on each wing. I
know the fellows will fight well enough in company. We
accordingly took his advice, and marched fifty to the right
wing, and the same number to the left, and with the rest
made a line of reserve, leaving the last two hundred men
to guard the camels, or to assist us, as occasion required.
Thus prepared, a party of the enemy came forward, view-
ing our posture, and traversing the ground on the front of
our line. Hereupon we ordered the two wings to move
on, and give them a salute with their shot; which accordingly was done. This put a stop to their proceedings;
for immediately wheeling off to their left, they all marched
away, and we saw no more of them. They had undoubtedly
given an account to their companions of what reception
they might expect, which made them so easily give over
their enterprize.
When we came to the city of Naum, we returned the
governor hearty thanks, and distributed a hundred crowns
among the soldiers that guarded us. We rested there one
day, and then proceeded on our travel?, passing several
great rivers and deserts; and on the 13th of April we came
to the frouliers of Muscovy, the first town of which was
called Argun.
This happy occasion, as I thought, of coming into a
Christian country, made me congratulate the Scotch mer-
chant upon it. He smiled at that, telling me not to rejoice
too soon; "fo*,'t said he, "except the Russian soldiers in
garrison, and a few inhabitants of the cities upon the road,
all the rest of this country, for above a thousand miles, is
inhabited by the most ignorant and barbarous Pagans."
We advanced from the river Arguna by moderate jour-
nies, and found convenient garrisons on the road, filled with
Christian soldiers, for tfie security of commerce, and for
the convenient lodgings of travellers: but the mhabitants
of the country were mere Pagans, worshipping the sun, moon,
ar.d stars. We particularly observed this idolatry near the
river Arguna, at a city inhabited by Tartars and Russians,
called Nerisinkey. Being curious to see their way of liv-
ing while the caravan continued to rest themselves in that city, I went to one of their villages, where there was
to be one of their solemn sacrifices. There I beheld,
upon the stump ot an old tree, an idol of wood, more ugly
than the representation of the devil himself: its head
resembling no living creature; its ears were as big and as
high as goats' horns, a crooked nose, four cornered mouth,
and horrible teeth: it was clothed in sheep-skins, had a
great Tartar bonnet, with two horns growing through it,
and was eight feet high, without feut, legs, or proportion. Before this idol there lay sixteen or seventeen people. who
brought their offerings, and were making iheir prayer.*,
while at a distance stood three men, and one bullock, as
victims to this ugly monster.
Such stupendous sacrilege as this in robbing the true God of his honour, filled me with the greatest astonishment
and reflection: which soon turmng to rage and Jury, I rode
up to the image, and cut in pieces th/; bonnet that was upon
his head with my sword, so that it hung down by one of
the horns, while one of my men that was with me pulled at
it by his sheep skin garment. Immediately an hideous
howling and outcry ran through the village, and two or three hundred people coining about our ears, we were
obliged to fly for it.
But I had not done with the monster; for the caravan
being to rest three nights in the town, I told the Scotch mer-
chant what I had seen, and that 1 was resolved to take four or five men well armed with me, in order to destroy the
idol, and show the people how liitle reason they had to trust
in a god who could not save himself. At first he laughed
at me, representing the danger of it; and when it was
destroyed, what time had we to preach to them better
things, whose zeal and ignorance was in the greatest degree,
and both unparalleled i that if I should be taken by them, I
should be served as a poor Ruflian who condemned their
worship; that is, to be stripped naked, and tied to the top
of the idol, there shot at with arrows till my body was lull
of them, and then burnt as a sacrifice to the monster; "but
Sir," said he, "since your zeal carries you so far, rathtr
than you should be alone I will accompany you, and bring
a stout fellow equal to yourself, if you will, to assist you in
this design:" and accsrdingly he brought one captain Rich-
ardson, who, hearing the story, readily consented; but my
partner declined it, being altogether out of his way: and
so we three, and my servant, resolved, to execute this ex-
plott about midnight; but upon second thoughts we defer-
red it to the next night, by reason that the caravan being
to go from hence the next morning, we should be out of
the governor's power. The better to effectuate my design,
1 procured a Tartar's sheep-skin robe, a bonnet, with bow
and arrows, and everyone of us got the like habits. The
first night we spent in mixing combustible matter with aqua-
vit,E, gunpowder, &c. having a good quantity of tar in a
little pot: next ni^ht we came up to the idol about eleven
o'clock, the moon being up. We found none guarding
it; but we perceived a light in the house, where we had
seen thepriests before. One of our men was for firing the
hut, another for killing the people, and a third for mak-
ing them prisoners, while the idol was destroyed. We
agreed to the latter; so knocking at the door, we seized
the first that opened it, and stopping his mouth and tying
his feet, we left him. We served the other two in the like
manner; and then the Scotch merchant set fire to the com-
position, which frightened them so much that we brought
them all away prisoners to their wooden god. There we
fell to work with him, daubing him all over with tar mixed
with tallow and brimstone, stopping his eyes, ears, and
mouth full of gunpowder, with a great piece of wild fire in
his bonnet, and environed it with dry forage. All this be-
ing done, we unloosed and ungagged the prisoners, and set
the idol on fire, which the gunpowder blowing up, the
shape of it was deformed, rent and split, which the forage
utterly consumed: for we stayed to see its destruction, lest
the ignorant, idolatrous people should have thrown them-
selves into the flames. And thus we came away undisco-
vered, in the morning appearing as busy among our fellow
travellers, as nobody could have suspected any other, but
that we had been in our beds all night.
Next morning we set out, and had gone but a small
distance from the city, when there came a multitude of
people of the country to the gates of the city, demanding
satisfaction of t he Russian governor for insulting their priest *,
and burning their great Cham Chi-Thaungu, who dwelt in
the sun, and no mortal would violate this image but some
Christian miscreants; and being already no less than thirty
thousand strong, they announced war against him and all
his Christians.
The governor assured them he was ignorant of the matter, and that none of his garrison had been abroad; that in-
deed there was a caravan that went away that morning, and
that he would send after them to inquire into it; and who-
ever was the offender, should be delivered into their hands.
This satisfied them for the present, but the governor sent
to inform us, that if any of us had done it, we should make
all the haste away possible, while he kept them in play as
long as he could. Upon this we marched two days and
two nights, stopping but very little, till at last we arrived
at a village called Plothus, and hastened to Jarawena, another
of the Czar's colonies. On the third day, having entered
the desert, and passed the lake called Shaks Oser, we be-
held a numerous body of horse on the other side of it to the
north, who supposed we had passed on that side the lake;
but either having found the mistake, or being certainly in-
formed of the way we took, they came upon us towards the
dusk of the evening, just as we had pitched our camp be-
tween two little but very thick woods, with a little river
running before our front and some felled trees with which
we covered our rear; a precaution we always took, and
which we had just finished when the enemy came up.—They did not fall on us immediately, but sent three messen-
gers, demanding the men who had insulted their priests,
and burnt their god Cham Chi-Thaungu, that they might
be burnt with fire; that if this was complied with, they
would peaceably depart; but if not, they would de-
stroy one and all of us. Our men stared at one another
on receipt of this message, but nobody was the word, as
indeed nobody knew it, but he who did it. Upon which
the leader of the caravan returned for answer, "That they
were peaceable merchants, who meddled with none of then-
priests and gods; and therefore desired them not to disturb
us, and put us under the necessity of defending ourselves."
But so far was this from satisfying them, that the next morning coming to our right, they fet fly a volley of arrows among
us, which happily did not hurt any, because we sheltered
ourselves behind our baggage. We expected however to
come to closer engagement: but were happily saved by
a cunning fellow, a Cossack, who obtaining leave of the
leader to go oul, mounts his horse, rides directly from our
rear, and taking a circutt, comes up to the Tartars, as
though he had been sent express, andtells them a formal
story, that the wretches who had burnt the Cham Chi-
Tliaungu, were gone to Shihcilka, with a resolution to burn Ihe
god Shal-Isar, belonging to the Tongueses. Upon which,
believing this cunning Tartar, who was servant to our Mus-
covites, away they drove toShiheilka, and in less than three
minutes were out of sight, nor did we ever hear of them more.
When we came to the city of Jarawena, we rested five
days, and then entered into a frightful desert, which held us
twenty three days march, infested with several small com-
panies of robbers, or Mogul Tartars, who never had the
courage to attack us. After we had passed over this desert,
we found several garrisons to defend the caravans from the
violence of the Tartars: in particular the governor of Adin-
skoy offered us a guard of fifty men to the next station, if
we apprehended any danger. The people here retained
the same paganism and barbarity, only they were not so
dangerous, being conquered by the Muscovites. The cloth-
ing, both of men and women, is.of the skins of beasts, living
under the ground in vaults and caves, which have a com-
munication with one another. They have idols almost in
every family; besides, they adore the sun and stars, water
and snow; and the least uncommon thing that happens in
the elements alarms them as much as thunder and lightning
does the unbelieving Jews.
Nothing remarkable occurecl in our march through this
country. When we had gone through the desert, after two
days farther travel, we came to Jenezoy, a Muscovite city,
on the great river so called, which we were told rrarted Eu-
rope from Asia. The inhabitants here were very little bet-
ter, though intermixed with the Muscovites, but the won-
der will cease, when I inform my reader of what was ob-
served to me, that the Czar rather converts the Tartars
with soldiers than clergymen, and is more proud to make
them faithful subjects, than good Christians.
From this city to the river Oby, we travelled over a
pleasant, fruitful, but very uncultivated country, for want
ofgood management and people, and those few are mostly
Pagans. This is the place where the Muscovite criminals
are banished to, if they are not put to death. The next
city we came to, was the capital city of Siberia, called To-
bolski, when having been almost seven months on our jour-
ney, and winter drawing on apace, my partner and I con-
sulted about our particular affairs, in what manner we should
dispose of ourselves. We had been told of sledges and
rem-deer to carry us over the snow in the winter season,
6
the snow being frozen so hard, that the sledges can run
upon the surface without any danger of going down. As I was bound to England, I now behoved either to go with the
Caravan to Jereslaw, from thence west to Narva, and the
gulf of Finland, and so by land or sea to Denmark; or
else I must leave the caravan at a tittle town on the Dwina,
and so to Archangel, where I was certain of shipping either
to England, Holland, or Hamburgh. One night I happened
to get into the company of an illustrious, but banished Prince,
whose company and virtues were such as made me pro-
pose to him a method how he might obtain his liberty.—
"My dear friend," said he, "as 1 am here happily free from
my miserable greatness, with all its attendants of pride, am-
bition, avarice, and luxury, if I should escape from this place,
those pernicious seeds may again revive, to my lasting dis-
quietude; therefore let me remain in a blessed confinement,
lor I am but flesh, a mere man, with passionsand affections
as such; O be not my friend and tempter too r" Struck
dumb with surprise, I stood silent awhile; nor was he less
in disorder, by which perceiving he wanted to give vent to
his mind, I desired him to consider of it, and so withdrew.
But about two hours after he came to my apartment: "Dear
friend," said he, "though I cannot consent to accompany
you, I shall have this satisfaction in parting, that you leave
me an honest man still; but as a testimony of my affection
to you, be pleased to accept this present of sables."
In return for his compliment; I sent my servant next
morning to his lordship with a small present of tea, two
pieces of China damask, and four little wedges of gold;
hut he only accepted the tea, one piece of damask, and one
piece of gold, for the curiosity of the Japan stamp that was
upon it. Not long after he sent for me, and told me that
what he had refused himself, he hoped, upon his account, I
would grant to another, whom he should name: In short it
was his only son, who was about two hundred miles distant
from him, on the other side of the city, whom he said he
would send for, if j gave my consent. This I soon com-
plied with; upon which he sent his servant next day for
in> son, who returned in twenty days time, bringing seven
horses loaded with valuable furs. At night the young lord was conducted incognito into our apartment, where his fa--
ther presented him to me. We then concerted the best
X
\vays for travelling, and after having bought a considerable
quantity of sables, black fox skins, fine ermines, &c.
fwhich I sold at Archangel at a good price) we set out from
this city the beginning ofJune, making a small caravan,be-
ing about thirty-two horses and camels, of which I repre-
sentecTlhe head. My young lord had with him a very
faithful Siberian servant, well acquainted with the roads.
We shunned the principal towns and cities, asTumen, Soli
Kamoskoi, and several others, by reason of their strictness
in examining travellers, lest any of the banished persons of
distinction should escape. Having passed the river Kama,
we came to a city on the European side, called Soloy Ka-
mosko., where we found the people mostly Pagans asbefore.
\Ve then passed a desert of about two hundred miles over;
but in other places it is near seven hundred. In passing
this wild place, we were beset by a troop of men on horse-
back, and about five and forty men armed with bows and
arrows. At first they looked earnestly on us, and then
placed themselves in our way. We wire above sixteen
men, and drew up a little line before our camels. My
young lord sent out his Siberian servant, to know who
they were; but, when he approached them, he neither
knew a word they said, nor would they admit him to come
near them at his peril, but prepared to shoot him. At his
return, he told us he believed them to be Calmuck Tar-
tars; and that there were more upon the desert. This was
but a small comfort to us; yet seeing a little grove, about
a quarter of a mile distant, we moved to it, by the old
Portuguese pilot's advice, without meeting with any oppo-
sition. Here we found a marshy piece of ground, and a
spring of water running into a little brook on one side,
which joined another like it a little farther off, and these
two formed the head of the river called^Vritska. As soon
as we arrived, we went to work, cutting great arms oft the
trees, and laying them hanging not quite off from one tree
to another. In this situation we waited the motion of the
enemy, without perceiving any advancement they made
towards us. About two hours bef,re night, being joined by some other?, in ail about fourscore horses, among whom
we fancied were some women, they came upon us with great
fur\. V\'e tired without ball, calling to them in the Russian
tongue, to know their business;. but they either not know-
ing, or seeming not to understand us, came directly to the 
6
. wood-side, not considering that we were so fortified, as that
they could not break in. Our old pilot, the Portuguese,
proved both our captain and engineer, and desired us not
to fire till they came within pistol shot; and when he gave
the word of command, then to take the surestaim; but he
didnotbidus give fire, till they were within two pikes length
of us, and then we killed fourteen of them, wounded seve-
ral, as also their horses, having every one of us loaded our
pieces with two or three bullets at least. So much were
they surprised at our undauntedness, that they retired about
a hundred roods from us. In the mean while we loaded
our pieces again, and sallying out, secured four or five of
their horses, whose riders we found were killed, and per-
ceived them'to be Tartars. About an hour after, they
made another attempt, to see where they might break iii; .
but finding us ready to receive them, they retired.
All that night we wrought hard, in strengthening our
situation, and barricading the entrance into the woods;
but when daylight came we made a very unwelcome dis-
covery; for the enemy being encouraged by their num-
bers, had set up eleven or twelve tents, in form of ac"amp,
about three quarters of a mile from us. I must confess, I
was never more concerned in my life, giving myself and
all that I had over for lost. And my partner declared, that
as the loss of his goods would be his ruin, before they should
be taken from him, he would fight to the last drop of his
blood. As we could not pretend to force our way, we had
recourse to a stratagem; we kindled a large fire, which
burnt all night; and no sooner was it dark, but we pursued
our journey towards the pole or north star; and travelling
all night, by six o'clock in the morning we came to a Rus-
sian village, called Kertza, and from thence came to a large
town named Ozonzoys, where we heard that several troops
of Calmuck Tartars had been abroad upon the desert, but
that we were past all danger. In five days after we came
to Veuslima, upon the river Witzedga; from thence we
came to Lawrenskoy, on the third of July, where, provid-
ing ourselves with two luggage boats, and a convenient
bark, we embarked the seventh, and arrived at Archangel
the eighteenth, after a year, five months,,and three days
journey, including the eight months and odd days at To-
bolsjti. We came from Archangel the 20th of August in X 2.
the same year, and arrived at Hamburgh the 30th of Sep-
tember. Here my partner and I made a very good sale of
our goods, both those of China and Siberia; when, dividing
our effects, my share came to 34751. 17s. 3d. after all the
losses we had sustafned, and charges we had been at.—Here the young lord took his leave of me, in order to go
to the court of Vienna, not only to seek protection, but to
correspond with his father's friends. After we had staid
four months in Hamburgh, I went from thence over-land
to the Hague, where embarking in the packet, 1 arrived in
London the I Oth of January, 170i, after ten years and nine
months absence from England.
VISION OF THE ANGELIC WORLD.
CHAF. I.
OF SOLITUDE.
HOWEVER solitude is looked upon as a restraint to the
pleasure of the world, in company and conversation, yet it
is a happy state of exemption from a sea of trouble, an
inundation of vanity and vexation, of confusion and disap-
pointment. While we enjoy ourselves, neither the joy nor
sorrow of other men affect us.: We are then at liberty,
with the voice of our soul, to speak to God. By this we
shun such frequent trivial discourse, as often becomes an ob-
struction to virtue: and how often do we find that we hail
reason to wish we had not been in company, or said nothing
when we were there? for either we offend God by the im-
piety of our discourse, or lay ourselves open to the violence
of designing people by our unguarded expressions; and
frequently feel the coolness and treachery of pretended
friends, when once involved in trouble and affliction; of
such unfaithful intimates, (I should say enemies) who rather
by false inuendoes would accumulate miseries upon us, than
honestly assist us when under thehard hand of adversity.
But in a state of solitude, when our tongues cannot be heard,
except from the great Majesty of Heaven, how happy are
we, in the blessed enjoyment of conversing with our Ma-
ker! it is then we make him our friend, which sets us above the envy and contempt of wicked men. When a man converses with himself, he is sure that he does not
converse with an enemy. Our retreat should be to good
company, and good books. I mean not by solitude, that
a man should retire into a cell, a desert, or a monastery:
which would be altogether an useless and unprofitable re-
straint: for as men are formed for society, and have an
absolute necessity and dependence upon one another, so
there is a retirement of the soul, with which it converses in
heaven, even in the midst of men; and indeed no man is
more fit to speak freely, than he who can, without any
violence to himself, refrain his tongue, or keep silence atto- -gether. As to religion, it is by this the soul gets acquaint-
ed with the hidden mysteries of the holy writings; here
she finds those floods of tears, in which good men wash themselves day and night, and only makes a visit to God, and his holy angels. In this conversation the truest peace and
most solid joy are to be found; it is a continual feast of
contentment on earth, and the means of attaining everlast-.-ing happiness hi heaven.
CHAP. II.,
OF HONESTY^.
Honesty is a virtue beloved by good men, and pretended
to by all other persons. In this there are several degrees: to pay every man his own is the common law of honesty;
but to do good to all mankind, is the chancery law of ho-
nesty; and this chancery-court is in every man's breast,
where his conscience is a Lord Chancellor. Hence it" is,
that a miser, though he pays every body their own, cannot
be an honest man, when he does not discharge the good
offices that are incumbent on a friendly, kind, and generous
person: for, saith the prophet Isaiah, chap, xxxii. ver, 7, 8.
"The instruments of a churl are evil: he deviseth wicked
devices to destroy the poor with lying words, even when
the needy speaketh right. But the liberal soul deviseth
liberal things, and by liberal things shall he stand." It is
certainly honest to do every thing the law requires; but
should we throw every poor debtor into prison till he has X3
paid the utmost farthing, hr.ng every malefactor without
mercy, exact the penalty of every bond, and the forfeiture
of every indenture, this would be downright cruelty, and
not honesty; and it is contrary to that general rule, "To do
to another, that which you would havedone unto you." Some-
times necessity makes an honest man a knave; and a rich
man an honestman, because he has no occasion to be a knave.
The trial of honesty is this: did you ever want bread, and
had your neighbour's loaf in keeping, and would starve ra-
ther than eat it? were you ever arrested, having in your
custody another man's cash, and would rather go to gaol,
than break it? if so, this indeed may be reckoned honesty.
For King Solomon tells us, "That a good name is better
than life, and is a precious ointment, and which, when a
man has once lost, he has nothing left worth keeping."
CHAP. III.
Of tlie pment sMr if RELIGION in the World.
I doubt, indeed, there is much more devotion than reli-
gion in the world; more adoration than supplication; and
more hypocrisy than sincerity: and it is very melancholy
to consider, what numbers of people there are furnished
with the powers of reason and gifts of nature, and yet aban-
doned to the grossest ignorance and depravity. But it would
be uncharitable for us to imagine (as some Papists, abound-
ing with too much ill-nature, the only scandal to religion,
do) that they will certainly be in a state of damnation after
this life; for how can we think it consistent with the mercy
and goodness of an. infinite Being, to damn those creatures,
when he has not furnished them with the light of the gos-
pel - or how can such proud, conceited, and cruel bigots,
prescribe rules to the justice and mercy of God?
We are told by some people, that the great image which
king Nebuchadnezzar set up to be adored by his people,
held the representation of the sun in its right hand, as the
principal object of adoration. But to wave this discourse of
Heathens, how many self-contradicting principles are there
held among Christians? and how do we doom one another
to the devil, while all profess to worship the same deity, and to expect the same salvation?
When I was at Portugal, there was held at that time the
court of justice of the inquisition. All the criminals were
carried in procession to the great church, where eight of
them were habited in gownsand caps of canvas, whereon
the torments of hell were displayed, and they were con-
demned and burnt for crimes against the catholic faith and
blessed Virgin.
I am sorry to make any reflections upon Christians; but, indeed in Italy the Roman religion seems the most cruel and mercenary upon earth; and a very judicious person, who travelled through Italy from Turkey, tells, "That
"there is only the face and outward pomp of religion there:
"that the church protects murderers and assassins, and
"then delivers the civil magistrates over to Satan for doing
"justice; interdicts whole kingdoms, and shuts up the
'churches for want of paying a few ecclesiastical dues, and
'so puts a stop to religion for want of their money: that
'the court of inquisition burnt two men for speaking dis-
'honourably of the blessed Virgin; and the missionaries
'of China tolerated the worshipping thedevil by their new
'converts: that Italy was the theatre, where religion was.
'the grand opera; and that the popish clergy were no
* oth'er than the stage players."
As to religion in Poland, they deny Christ to be the
Messiah, or that the Messiah has come in the flesh. And
as to their Protestants, they are the followers of Laelius
Socinus, who denied our Saviour's divinity; and have no
concern about the divine inspiration of the Holy Ghost.
In Muscovy their churches are built of wood, and, in-
deed, they have but wooden priests,'though of the Greek
church; they pray as much to saint Nicholas, as the Papists
do to the Virgin Mary, for protection in all their difficulties
or afflictions.
As to Lutherans, they only differ from the Romans in
believing consubstantiation, instead of transubstantiation;
but, like them, they are much pleased with the external gal-
lantry and pomp, more than the true and real practice of it.
In France I found a world of priests, the streets every
where crowded with them, and the churches full of women:
but surely never was a nation so full of blind guides, so ig-
norant of religion, and even so void of morals, as those
people who confess their sins to them.
Does it not seem strange, that, while all men own the
divine Being, there should be so many different opinions as to the manner of paying him obedience in the Christian
church? I know not what reason to assign for this, except
it be their different capacities and faculties.
And, indeed, upon this account, we have perceived, in
all Christian countries, what mortal feuds have beerf about
religion; what wars and bloodshed have molested Europe,
till the general pacification of the German troubles at the
treaty of Westphalia, and since those times, what persecu-
tion in the same country among the churches of the Lutherans; and should I take a prospect at home, what unhappy
divisions are between Christians in this kingdom, about
Episcopacy and Presbytery; the church of England and
the Dissenters opposing one another like St. Paul and St.
Peter, even to the face; that is, they carry on the dispute
to the utmdst extremity.
It might be a question, why there are such differences in
religious points, and why these breaches should be more hot
and irreconcilable? All the answer I can give to this, is,
that we inquire more concerning the truth of religion, than
any other nation in the world; and the anxious concern we
have about it, makes us jealous of every opinion and tenacious of our own; and this is not because we are niore
furious and rash than other people; but the truth is, we are
more concerned about them, and being sensible that the
scripture is the great rule of faith, the standard for life and
doctrine, we have recourse to it ourselves, without subuiit-
tiijg to any pretended infallible judge upon earth.
There is another question, pertinent to the former, and
that is, what remedy can we apply to this malady? And to
this I must negatively answer, not to be less religious, that
we may differ the less. This is striking at the very root of
all religious differences; fur, certaioiy, were they to be
carried on with a peaceable spirit, willing to be informed,
our variety of opinions would not have the name of differ-
ences; nor should we separate in communion of charity, though we did not agree in several articles of religion.
Nor is there a less useful question to start, namely, where will our unhappy religious differences end? to which, I
hope, I may answer, in heaven; there all unchristian and unbrotherly differences will find a period; there we shall
embrace many a sinner, that here we think it a dishonour
to converse with; and perceive many a heart we have bro-
ken here with censures, reproachings, and revilings, made
whole again by the balm of the same Redeemer's blood
L
Here we shall perceive there have been other flocks than
those of our fold; that those we have excommunicated have
been taken into that superior communion; and in a word,
that those contradicting notions and principles which we
thought inconsistent with true religion, we shall then find
reconcilable to themselves, to one another, and to the
fountain of truth. If any man ask me, why our differences
cannot be ended on earth? (answer, Were we all thorough-
ly convinced, that then they would be reconciled, we would
put an end to them before; but this is impossible to be done;
for as men's certain convictions of truth are not equal to
one another, or the weight of significancy of such veracity,
so neither can a general effect of this affair be expected on this side of time.
Before I conclude this chapter, 1 shall beg leave to dis-
course a little of the wonderful excellency of negative re-
ligion and negative virtue. The latter sets out, like the
Pharisee, with—God, I thank thcej it is a piece of religi-
ous pageantry, the hypocrite's hope: and in a word, it is
positive vice: for it is either a mask to deceive others, or a
mist to deceive ourselves. A man that is clothed with ne-
gatives, thus argues: I am not such a drunkard as my land-
lord, such a thief as my tenant, such a swearer as his neigh-
bour; neither am la cheat, an atheist, a rakish fellow, or
a highwayman; no! I live a sober, regular, retired life: I
am a good man, I go to church; God, 1 thank thee. Now,
though a man boasts of his virtue in contradiction to the
vices mentioned, yet a person had better have them alto-
gether than the man himself; for he is full of himself, so
persuaded that he is good and religious enough already,
that he has no thoughts of any thing, except it be to pull off
his hat to God Almighty now and then, and thank him that
he has no occasion for him; and has the vanity to think
that his neighbours must imagine well of h:m too.
The negative man, though he is no drunkard, is yet in-
toxicated with the pride of his own worth; a good neigh-
bour and peace-maker in other families, but a tyrant in his
own; appears in a church for a show, but never falls upon -
his knees in his closet; does all his alms before men, to be seen of them; eager in the duties of the second table, but
regardless of the first: appears religious, to betaken notice
of by men, but without intercourse or communication
between God and his own soul: pray, what is this man? or what comfort is there of the life he lives? he isinsensib!e
of faith, repentance, and a Christian mortified life: in a word
he is perfectly a stranger to the essential part of religion.
Let us for a while enter into the private and retired part
of his conversation: what notions has he of his mispent
hours, and of the progress of time to the great centre and gulf of life, eternity "'. Does he know how to put a right
value on time, or esteem the life-blood of his soul, as it
really is, and act in a!! the moments of it, as one that must
account for them? iftlu.n you can form an equality between
what he can do and what he shall receive, less can be
founded upon his negative virtue, or what he hasforeborne
to do: and if neither his negative nor positive piety can
be equal to the reward, and to the eternity that reward is to
last for, what then is to become of the Pharisee, when he is
to be judged by the sincerity ofhis repentance, and reward-
ed, according to the infinite grace of God, with a state of
blessedness to an endless eternity?
When the negative man converses with the invisible
world, he is rilled with as much horror and dread as Felix,
when St. Paul reasoned to him of temperance, righteous-
ness, and of judgment to come; for Felix, though a great
philosopher, of great power and. reverence, was a negative
man, and he was made sensible by the apostle, that, as a.
life of virtue and temperance was its own reward, by giving
a healthy body, a clear head, and a composed life, so eter-
ral happiness must proceed from another spring; namely,
the infinite unbounded grace of a provoked God, who hav-
ing erected a righteous tribunal, Jesus Christ would sepa-
rate such as by faith and repentance he had brought home
and united to himself by the grace of adoption, and on the
foot of his having laid down his life as a ransom fpr them,
had appointed them to salvation, when all the philosophy,
temperance, and righteousness in the world besides had
been ineffectual. And this, I say, it was, that made Felix,
this negative man,. tremble.
CHAP. IV.
Gf listening to the voice of Prtrvidcnce.
The magnificent and wise king Solomon bids us cry after
knowledge, and lift up our voice for understanding; by
which is meant, religious knowledge; for it follows: "T'
shalt thou understand the fear of the Lord, and find the
knowledge of God." By which undoubtedly he meant to
inquire after every thing he has permitted us to know, and
not to search into those ways that are unsearchable, and are
effectually locked up from our knowledge.—Now, "as
listening to the voice of Providence"4s my present subject,
I intend, in the first place, to write to those who own—1.
That there is a God, a first great movingcause of all things,
an eternal power, prior, and consequently superior to all
created power or being.—2. That this eternal power, which
is God, is the sovereign creator and governor of heaven and
earth.
To avoid all needlessdistinctions, what persons in the God-
head exercise the creating, and what the governing power,
I offer that glorious text, Psal. xxiii. 6. where the whole
Trinity is entitled to the whole creating work: and therefore,
in the next place, I shall lay down these two propositions:
I. That the eternal God guides by his providence, the
whole universe, which was created by his power.
II. That this Providence manifests a particular care over,
and concern in, the governing and directing man, the most
noble creature upon earth.
It is plain, that natural religion proves the first, by inti-
mating the necessity of a Providence guiding and govern-
ing the world, from the consequence of the wisdom, justice,
prescience, and goodness of the Almighty Creator: for
otherwise it would be absurd to think, that God should
create a world, without any care or providence over it, in
guiding the operations of nature, so as to preserve the or-
der of his creation.
Revealed religion gives us a light into the care and con-
cern of his providence, by the climate's being made habit-
able, the creatures subjected and made nourishing, and all
vegetative life made medicinal; and all this for the sake of
man, who is made viceroyto the king of the earth. The
short description I shall give of providence is this: "That
it is that operation of the power, of the wisdom, justice,
and goodness of God, by which he influences, governs, and
directs, not only the means, but the events of all things,
which concerns us in this sublunary world; the sovereign!
of which we ought always to reverence, obey its motions, observe its dictates, and listen to its voice. The pruj^- t.
."man.lbrtseeth the evil, and hideth himself; that is, a 1 - i, '.
it, there is a secret providence intimates to us, that some
danger threatens, if we strive not to shun it."
The same day that Sir John Hotham kept out Hull
against the royal Martyr King Charles I. the same day Sir
John Hotham was put to death by the parliament for that
very action: the same day that the King himself signed the
warrant for the execution of the earl of Straffbrd, the same
day of the month was he barbarously murdered by the blood-
-thirsty Oliverian crew: and the same day that king James
II. came to the crown against the bill of exclusion, the same
day he was voted abdicated by the parliament, and the
throne filled with King William and Queen Mary.
The voice of signal deliverances from sudden danger, is
not only a just call to repentance, but a caution against fall-
ing into the like danger; but such-who are utterly careless
of themselves after, show a lethargy of the worst nature,
which seems to me to be a kind of practical atheism, or at
least living in a contempt of heaven, when he receives
good at the hand of his Maker, but is unconcerned from
whence it comes, or to thank the bountiful hand that gave
it; neither, when he receives evil, does it alter his manner
of life, or bring him to any state of humiliation.
We have a remarkable story of two soldiers being con-
demned to death in Flanders. The general being prevailed
upon tospare one of them, ordered them to cast dice upon
the drum head for their lives; the first having thrown two
sixes, the second fell a wringing his hands, having so poor a
chance to escape; however, having thrown, he was surpris-
ed when he also throw-other two sixes. Theotlicer appoint-
ed to see the execution, ordered them to throw again; they
did so and each of them threw fives; at which. tlie soldiers
that stood round, shouted, and said, neither ot them was to
die. Upon this, the officer acquainted the council of war,
who ordered them to throw a third time, when they threw
two fours: the general being acquainted with it, sent for
the men, and pardoned them: I love, saidhe, in such ex-
traordinary cases, to listen to the voice of Providence.
We read in the holy writings, how God speaks to men
by appearance of angels, or by dreams and visions of the
night. As God appeared to Abraham, Lot, and Jacob:
so angels have appeared to many in other cases, as to Ma-
noan and his wite, Zachariah, the Virgin Mary, and to the
apostles; others have been warned in a dream, as King
Abimelecb, the false prophet Balaam, and many others."
It is certainly a very great and noble inquiry, "What we
shall be after this life?" for there is scarce a doubt, that
there is a place reserved for the reception of our souls after
death: for if we are to be, we must have a where, which
the scriptures assert by the examples of Dives and Lazarus.
The doctrine of spirits was long believed before our Sa-
viour's time; for when the disciples of the blessed Jesus
perceived our Saviour walking on the sea, they were as
much surprised as though they had seen a spirit. Nay, in
those ages of the world, it was believed that spirits inter-
meddled in the affairs of mankind; and throughout the Old
Testament, I do not find any thing that in the least con-
tradicts it. All the pains and labour that some learned men
have taken, to confute the story of the witch of Endor, and
the appearance of an old man personating Samuel, cannot
make such apparitions inconsistent with nature or religion;
and it is plain, that it was either a good or a bad spirit, that
prophetically told the unfortunate king what should happen
the next day; for, said the spirit, "The Lord will deliver
thee into the hands of the Philistines; and to-morrow shalt
thou and thy sons be with me."
Abundance of strange notions possessed me, when I was
in the desolate island; especially on a moonshine night,
when every bush seemed a man, and every tree a man on
horseback. When I crept into the dismal cave where the
old goat lay expiring, whose articulate groans even resem-
bled those of a man, how was I surprised! my blood chil-
led in my veins, a cold sweaty dew sat on my forehead,
my hair stood upright, and my joints, like Belshazzar's
knees, struck against one another. And, indeed, though I
afterwards found what it was, the remains of this surprise did not wear off for a great while; and I had frequently
returns of those vapours on different occasions, and some-
times without any occasion at all.
One night, after having seen some appearance in the air,
as I had just laid down in my bed, one of my tci t pained
me; after that came a numbness, succeeded with a tingling
in my blood; when on a sudden I thought something alive
lay upon me, from my knee to above half my leg. Upon
tiiis 1 flung myself out of bed where I thought tlio CiCdture
lay; but finding nothing, "Lord deliver me from an evil
spirit," said I; "what can this be?" When 1 lighted a
candle, I could perceive no living creature in the place i
with me, but the poor parrot, who being frightened, cried
nut, "Hold your tongue," and "What's the matter with
you?" which words I had taught him by saying so to him,
when he had made such screaming noises as I did not like. "Lord," said I aloud, "surely the devil has been here."
"Hold your tongue," says poll. I was then mad at the
bird, and putting on my clothes, cried, "I am terribly
frightened." "What's the matter with you ?" says Poll.
"You toad," said I, "I'll knock your brains out." "Hold
your tongue," cried he again, and so fell a chattering.,
and calling Robinson Crusoe, as he did before. But, after
I had composed myself, and went to bed again, I began
plainly to see it was a distemper that affected my nerves,
and so my terrors vanished at once. i
How intelligences are given or received, we do not know;
nor are we sensible how they are conveyed from spirits em-
bodied to ours that are in life; or, on the contrary, from us
to them; the latter is certainly done without the help of the
organs, and the former is conveyed by the understanding,
and the retired faculties of the soul.
The spirits, without the help of voices, converse, and the
more particular discoveries of converse of the spirits, seem to me as follow: to wit, dreams, voices, noises, impulses,
hints, apprehensions, involuntary sadness, &c. Dreams of old were the ways by which God himself was
pleased to warn men what services to perform, and what to
shun. Joseph was directed of God in a dream to go to
Egvpt j and so were the wise men warned in a dream to
depart into their own country another way, to avoid the
fury of Herod. I am not like those who think dreams are
the mere designs of a delirious head, or the relics of a day's
perplexities or pleasures; but on the contrary, I must beg
Lave to say, I never met with any capital mischief in my
life, but I ha.1 some notice of it by a dream; and had I not
been a thoughtless, unbelieving creature, I mtght have taken
many a warning, and avoided many of the evils I after-
wards fell into, merely by total neglect of those dreams.
i was once present at a dispute between a layman and a
clergyman, upon the subject ot dreams, The first thought
r.o ivg.ird should be given unto them; that their communi-
cation from the invisible to the visible world was a mere
chimera; without any solid foundation. For. tiist, said he, if Jceanis weie from the agency of anyprescient bsing, the
motives would be more direct, and the discoveries more
plain, and not by allegories and emblematic .fancies, ex-
pressing things imperfect and obscure. 2. Since, with the
notice of evil, there was not a power given to.avoid it, it
is not likely to proceed from a spirit, but merely fortuitous. 3. That the inconstancy of such notices, in cases equally
important, proves they did not proceed from any such agent. 4. That as our most distinct dreams had nothing in them of
any significany, it would be irrational and vain to think
that they came from heaven. And, 5. That as men were not always thus warned or supplied with notice of good or
evil, so all men are not alike supplied with them; and what
reason could we give, why one man or one woman should
not have the same hints as another? To all this the clergyman gave answer: 1. That as to
the signification of dreams, and the objections against them,
as being dark and doubtful, they are expressed generally by
hieroglyphical representations, similies, allusions, and figura-
tive emblematic ways, by which means, for want of inter-
pretation, the thing was not understood, and, consequently,
the evil not shunned. 2. That we charge God foolishly,
to say, that he has given the notice of evil, without the
power to avoid it; for, if any one had not power to avoid
the evil, it was no notice to him; and it was want of giving
due heed to thatnotice, that men first neglected themselves,
and then charged the Judge of all the earth with injustice.
3. That we ought not to find fault with the inconstancy of
these notices, but rather with our weak understandings,
by pretending dreams were not to be regarded, and negli-
gent when the voice really spoke to us for our good. It is
a mistake to say dreams have no import at all: we might,
with more reason, have said, none that we could perceive
the reason of, owing to our blindness and supine negligence,
too secure at one time, and too much alarmed at another;
so that the spirit, which we might be said to be conversing
with in a dream, was constantly and equally kind and care-
ful; but our powers are not always in the same state of
action, not equally attentive to, or retentive of the hints
I hat were given. And, 5. To answer the last question,
why people are not equally supplied? this seems to be
no question: for providence itself might have some share in
the direction of it, and then that providence might be li-
mited by a superior direction; that as to the converse of.

Y2
spirits, he could not call it a stated converse: such a thing
there was, but why there was so much of it, and no more,
was none of his business, and that no such discovery had
ever yet been made to mankind. Nbrwere we to imagine
less of waking dreams, trances, visions, noises, hints, im-
pulses, and all the waking testimonies of an invisible world,
and of the communication that there is between us and
them, which commonly entertain us with our open eyes.
One time my fancy soared on high, to see what disco-
veries I could make in those clearer regions. I found that
such immense bodies of the sun, stars, planets and moon,
in the great circle of the lower heaven, are far from being
found in the study of nature on the surface of the earth.
Here I saw many things that we can entertain little or no
notion of, in a state of common lift-, and the emptiness of
our notion, that the planets are habitable worlds; that is,
created like ours, for the subsistence and existence of man
and beast, and the preservation of the vegetative and sensi-
tive life: no, no; this is, I assure you, a world of spirits;
for here I saw a clear demonstration of satan being the
prince of the ficiuer of the air, keeping his court or camp,
with innumerable angels to attend him; but his power is
not so great as we imagine, he can tempt us to the crime,
but cannot force us to commit: Humanum cst fcccatc. Nei-
ther has the devil power to force the world into a rebellion
against heaven, though his legions are employed among
savage nations, to set up their master for a god, who make
the heathens either worship him in person, or by his repre-
sentatives, idols and monsters, with the cruel sacrifices of
human blood. Now, as tothelimitationsofthedevil's power,
you must understand, that, as there are numbers of evil
spirits employed in mischief, so there are numbers of good
angels sent from the higher and blessed abodes to discon-
cert and oppose their measures; and this every Christian,
I hope, believes, when he prays to God, the father of spi-
rits, to give his angels charge over him while he slumbereth and sleepeth. For if by these preventing powers the devil was not restrained, the earth would be subjected to
dearth, droughts, and famine; the air in-fected'vwth noxious
fumes; and, in a word, mankind would be utterly destroyed,
which might oblige our Maker (if I may be allowed the
expression) to the necessity of a new fat, or else have no
more creatures to honour and worship him.
As the devil never wanted insinuators, I shall observe, that I learned a way how to make a man dream of what I
pleased. For instance, letussupposeone to be sound asleep;
let another lay his mouth close to his ear, and whisper any
tiiing so softly as not to awake him, the sleeping man shall
dream of what has been so whispered in his ear; nay, I can
assure you, those insinuating devils can do this even when
we are awake, which I call impulses of the mind: for from
whence, but from these insinuators, come our causeless pas-
sions, involuntary wickedness, or sinful desires? who else
Ibrm ideas in the mind of man when he is asleep, or pre-
sent terrible or beautiful figures to his fancy? Mr. Milton
represents the devil tempting Eve in the shape of a toad,
lying just at her ear, when in her bower she lay fast asleep;
and brings in Eve telling Adam what an uneasy night's rest she had, and relating her dream to him. And likewise
I believe that good spirits have the same intercourse wiili
us, in warning us against those things that are evil, and
prompting us to that which is good.
Were we to have the eyes of our souls opened, through
the eyes of our bodies, we should see this very immediate
region of air which we breathe in, thronged with spirits
now invisible, and which otherwise would be the most ter-
rible; we should view the secret transactions of those mes-
sengers who are employed when the parting soul takes its
leave of the reluctant body, and perhaps see things nature
would shrink back from with the utmost terror and amaze-
ment. In a word, the curtain of providence for the dis-
position of things here, and the curtain of judgment for the
determination of the state of souls hereafter, would be alike
drawn buck; and what heart could support here its future
state in life; much less that of its future state after life,
even good or bad. A gentleman of my acquaintance, being about seven miles distant from London, a friend that came to dine with him,
solicited him to go to the city. "What," said the gentle-
man, "is there any occasion for me?" " No, Sir," said the
other, "nothing at all, except the enjoyment of your good
company:" and so gave over importuning him. Just then
a strong impulse of mind urged the gentleman, and pursued
him like a voice, with," Go to London, Go to London." "Hark ye," says he to his friend, "is all well at London?"
Am 1 wanted there? or, did you ask me to go with you on any particular account? Are all my family well?" "Yes,
indeed, Sir," said he, " I perceived them all very hearty;
and I did not ask you to go to London upon any particular
account whatsoever, except it was for the sake of your good
company." Again he put off his resolution: but still the
impulse suggested to him, " Go to London;" and at length
he did so. When he came there, he found a letter, and a
messenger had been there to seek him, and to tell him of a
particular business, which was at first and last above a thou-
sand pounds to him, and which might inevitably have been
lost, had he not gone to London that night.
The obeying of several hints, or secret impulses, argues
great wisdom. I knew a man that was under misfortune?,
being guilty of misdemeanors against the government;
when, absconding for fear of his ruin, all his friends advi-
sing him not to put himself in the hands of the law, one
morning as he awaked, he felt a strong impulse-darting in-
to his mind thus, " Write a letter to them;" and thiaSftta
repeated several times to his mind, and at last he answered
to it, as if it had been a voice, "Whom shall I write tor"
Immediately it. replied, "Write to the judge:" and this
impulse pursued him for several days, till at length he took
pen, ink, and paper, and sat down to write to him: when
immediately words flowed from his pen like streams from
a fair fountain, that charmed even himself with hopes of
success. In short, the letter was so strenuous in argument,
so pathetic in its eloquence, and so persuasively moving,
that when the judge had read it, he sent him an answer;, h*
might be easy, he would endeavour to make that matter
light to him: and, indeed, never left exerting himself till
he had stopt the prosecution, and restored him to his liberty
and family.
While I am mentioning these things, methinks it is very
hard that we should obey the whispers of evil spirits, and
not much rather receive the notices which good ones are
pleased to give. We never perceive the misfortune of this,
but when in real danger; and then we cry, "My mind mis-
gave me when I was going about it:" but if so, why do you
slight the caution t Why not listen to it as to a voice ? and
then there had been no reason to make this complaint.
1 remember about fourteen or fifteen years. ago (as to
time I cannot be very positive) there was a young clergy-
man in the cit)s.pf Dublin, in Ireland, who dreamed a very *? ROBINSON causers. 263

uncommon dream, that a gentleman had killed his wife, a
relation of his, by stabbing her in several places; the fright
of this awaked him, but finding it a dream, he composed
himself again to sleep, when he dreamed a second time the
same dream. This made him a little uneasy; but thinking
it proceeded from the impression made on his mind by the
former, he went to sleep again, and dreamed the same
dream a third time also. So troubled was he at this, that he rose, and knocked at his mother's chamber-door, told his
concern, and his apprehensions that all was not right at his
relation's house. "Dear Son," says the good old gentle-
woman, "do not mind those foolish dreams; and I very
much wonder, that you, being a person in holy orders, should
have regard to such illusions." Upon this he went to bed
again, fell asleep, and dreamed a fourth time as before.—
then indeed he put on his night-gown, and went to
Afield, the place where his relation dwelt. Here it
was, alas! he perceived his dream too sadlv fulfilled, by
seeing his relation the young lady, big with child, who was
a protestant, stabbed in several places by her barbarous
husband, Mr. Eustace, a violent Papist, onlv for some dis-
courses of religion that happened the day before. After
the wretch had stabbed her in three places, he went to
make his escape out at a window; but she cried out,
*' My dear! don't leave me, come back and I shall be well
again." At which he returned in a hellish rage, and gave
her four wounds more; when even in this condition, rising
from her bed, she wrapped herself in her nightgown, and
went to the Lord Bisj»p of Rapho's chamber door, (the
Bishop lodging at that^ime in the house) " My lord," said
she, "O my lord, make haste unto me;" but as' soon as
his Lordship came, she expired in his arms, resigning her
precious soul into the hands of Almighty God. The cruel
wretch, her husband, was shot by the pursuers; too good a
death for one who deserved the gibbet: and the lady was
universally lamented by all tender and religious people.
And this tragical relation I have mentioned, upon the ac-
count of that impulse, or dream, that the clergyman had at
the fata! time of the bloody action.
Some people make a very ill use of the general notion,
that there are no apparitions nor spirits at all: which is
worse than those who fancy they see them upon every oc-
casion; for those carry their notions farther, even to an-
mhilate the devil, and believe nothing about him, neither
of one kind or other: the next step they come to, is to
conclude, "There is no God," and so atheism takes its
rise in the same sink, with a carelessness about futurity.
But there is no occasion to enter upon an argument to prove
the being of the Almighty, or to illustrate his power by
words, whohasso many undeniable testimonies in the breasts
of every rational being to prove his existence: and we have
sufficient proofs enough to convince us of the great superintendency of divine providence in the minutest affairs of
this world; the mamfest existence of the invisible world;
the reality of spirits, and intelligence between us and them.
What I have said, I hope, will not mislead any person, or
be a means whereby they may delude themselves; for I
have spoken of these things with the utmost seriousness of
mind, and with a sincere and ardent desire for the good and benefit of the world.

PREFACE.
AF ever the story of any private man's adven-
tures in the world were worth making pub-
lic, and were acceptable when published, the
Editor of this account thinks this will be so.
The wonders of this man's life exceed all
that (he thinks) is to be found extant j the
life of one man being scarce capable of a
greater variety.
The story is told with modesty, with seri-
ousness, and with a religious application of
events to the uses to which wise men always
apply them, viz. to the instruction of others
by this example, and to justify and honour the
wisdom of Providence in all the variety of our
circumstances, let them happen how they will.
The Editor believes this narrative to be a
just history of fact; neither is there any appear-
ance of fiction in it: and though he is well
aware there are many who, on account of the
very singular preservations the Author met
with, will give it the name of romance; yet,
in which ever of these lights it shall be viewed,
he imagines, that the improvement of it, as
well as the diversion, as to the instruction of
the reader, will be the same; and as such, he
thinks, without farther compliment to the
world, he does them a great service in the.
publication.
Life and Adventures
OF
ROBINSON CRUSOE.
I WAS born at York, in the year 1632, of a reputable fa-
mily. My father was a native of Bremen, who by mer-
chandizing at Hull for some time, gained a very plentiful
fortune. He married my mother at York, who received
her first breath in that county ; and as her maiden name
was Robinfon, I was called Robinson Kreutznacr; which not
being easily pronounced in the English tongue, we are
commonly known by the name of Crusoe.
1 was the youngest of three brothers. The eldest was a
lieutenant-colonel in Lockhart's regiment, but slain by the
Spaniards: what became of the other I could never learn.
No charge or pains were wanting in my education.—
My father designed me for the law; yet nothing would
serve me but I must go to sea, both against the will of my
father, the tears of my mother, and the entreaties of friends.
One morning my fattier expostulated very warmly with me:
What reason, says he, have you to leave your native coun-
try, where there must be a more certain prospect of con-
tent and happiness, to enter into a wandering condition of
uneasiness and uncertainty? He recommended to me
Augur's wish, "Neither to desire poverty nor riches:"
that a middle state of life was the most happy, and that
the high towering thoughts of raising our condition by wan-
dering abroad, were surrounded with misery and danger,
and often ended with confusion and disappointment. I entreat you, nay, I command you, (says he) to desist from
these intentions. Consider your elder brother, who laid
down his life for his honour, or rather lost it for his disobe-
dience to my will. If you will go (added he) my prayers
shall however be offered for your preservation; but a time
may come, when desolate, opprefsed, or forsaken, you A
may wish you had taken your poor despised father's counsel.
He pronounced these words with such a moving and pater-
nal eloquence, while floodsof tears ran down his aged cheeks,
that it seemed to stem the torrent of my. resolutions. But
this soon wore off, and a little after I informed my mother,
that I could not settle to any business, my resolutions were
so strong to see the world; and begged she would gain my
father's consent only to go one voyage; which if it did not
prove prosperous, I would never attempt a second. But my
desire was as vain as my folly in asking. My mother paf-
sionatcly exprelied 1ier dislike of this proposal, telling me, "That as she saw I was bent upon my own destruction, con-
"trary to their will and my duty, she would say no more,
"but leave me to myself to do whatever I pleased."
I was then, I think, nineteen yearsold, when one timebe- .ing at Hull, I met a school-fellow of mine going along with
his father, who was master of a ship, to London; and ac-
quainting him with my wandering desires, he assured me of
a free passage, and a plentiful share of what w.as necefsary.
Thus, without imploring ablefsing, or taking farewell of my
parents, I took shipping on thefirst of September, 1631. We
set sail soon after, and our ship had scarce left the Humbcr
a-stern, when there arose so violent a storm, that b«ing exrtremely sea-sick, I concluded the judgment of God deserv-
edly followed me for my disobedience to my dear parents. It was then I called to mind the good advice of my father;
how easy and comfortable was a middle state of life; and
I firmly resolved, if it pleased God to set me on dry land
once more, I would return to my parents, implore their for*
givenefs, and bid a final adieu to my wandering inclinations.
Such were my thoughts while the storm continued; but
these good resolutions decreased with the danger; more
especially when my companion came to me clapping me on
the shoulder: "What, Bob \" said he, "sure you was not
frightened last night with scarce a capful of wind ?"—
"And do you," cried I, " call such a violent storm a capful
"of wind?" "A storm you fool you," said he, "this is no-
"thing; a good ship and sea-room always baffles such a
"foolish squall of wind as that: But you're a fresh water
"sailor: Come boy, turn out, see what tine weather we have
now, and a good bowl of punch will drown all your past
"sorrows." In short, the punch was made, I was drunk, and
in one night's time drowned both my repentance and
resolutions, forgetting entirely the vows and promises
I made in my distress: and whenever any reflections would
return on me, what by company, and what by drinking, I
soon mastered those fits, as I deridingly called them. But
this only made way for another trial, whereby I could not
but see how much I was beholden to kind Providence.
Upon the sixth day we came to an anchor in Harwich
road, where we lay wind-bound with some Newcastle ships;
and there being good anchorage, and our cables sound, the
seamen forgot their late toil and danger, and spent the time as merry as ifthey had been on shore. But on the eighth day
there arose a brisk gale of wind, which prevented our tiding
it up the river; and still increasing, our ship rode forecastle
in, and shipped several large seas.
It was not long before horror seized the seamen them-
selves, and I heard the master express this melancholy ejacu-
lation, '* Lord have mercy upon us, we shall be all lost and
undone!" For my part, sick unto death, I kept my cabin,
till the universal and terribly dreadful apprehensions of our speedy fate made me get upon deck; and there I was af-
frighted indeed. The sea went mountains high: I could
see nothing but distrefs around us; two ships had cut their
masts on board, and another was foundered; two more that
had lost their anchors, were forced out to the mercy of the
ocean: and to save our lives we were forced to cut out
foremast and mainmast quite away.
Who is there so ignorant as not to judge of my dreadful
condition? I was but a fresh water sailor, and therefore it
seemed more terrible. Our ship was very good, but over-
loaded 5 which made the sailors often cry out, "She would
"founder!" Words I then was ignorant of. All this while
the storm continuing, and rather increasing, the master and
the most sober part of his men went to prayers, expecting
death every moment. In the middle of the night one cried
out, "We had sprung a leak;" another, " That there was
"four feet water in the hold." I was just ready to expire
with fear, when immediately all hands were called to the
pump; and the men forced me also in that extremity to
share with them in their labour. While thus employed, the
master espying some light colliers, fired a gun as a signal of
distress; and I, not understanding what it meant, and think-
ing that either the ship broke, or some dreadful thing hap-
pened, fell into a swoon. Even in that common condition A 2
of woe, nobody minded me, excepting to thrust me aside
with their feet, thinking me dead, and it was a great while
before I recovered.
Happy it was for us, when upon the signal given, they
ventured out their boats to save our lives. All our pumping
had been in vain, and vain had all our at tempts beeu, had they
not come to our ship's side, and our men cast them a rope over
the stern with a buoy to it, which after great labour they got
hold o!, and we hauling them up to us, got into their boat,
and left our ship, which we perceived sink within less than a
quarter of an hour; and thus I learned what was meant by
four,aering at sea,. And now the men incessantly laboured to
recover their own ship; but the sea ran so high, and the wind
blew so hard, that they thought it convenient to hale within
shore; which, with great difficulty and danger, at last we
happily effected, landing at a place called Cramer, not far from
Winterton light-house; from whence we all walked to Yar-
mouth, where as objects of pity, many good people furnished
us \viih necef'aries to carry us either to Hull or London.
Strange, after all this, like the prodigal son, I did not re-
turn to my father; who hearing of the ship's calamity, for a
long time thought me entombed in the deep. No doubt
but I should have shared on his fatted calf, as the scripture
exprelstth it; but my ill /ate stiil pushed me on, in spite of
the powerful convictions of reason and conscience.
When we had been at Yarmouth three days, I met my
old companion, who had given me the invitation to go on
board along with his father. His behaviour and speech
were altered, and in a melancholy manner asked me howl
did. telling his father who I was, and how I had made this
voyage only for a trial to proceed further abroad. Upon
which the old gentleman turning to me gravely, said,
"Young man, you ought never to go to sea any more, but to
take this for a certain sign that you never will prosper in
a seafaring condition." "Sir," answered I, "will you
take the same resolution?" " U is a different case," said
he, "it is my calling, and consequently my duty; but as
you have made this voyage for a trial, you see what ill
"succels Heaven has set before your eyes; and perhaps
our miseries have been on your account, likejena/i in the
ship of Taishisli. But pray, what are you, and on what
"account did you go to sea?" Upon which 1 verv freely
declared my whole story: at the end of which he made this *'
exclamation: "Ye sacred powers: what had I committed,
"that such a wretch should enter into my ship to heap upon
me such a deluge of miseries!" But soon recollecting
his passion, "Young man," said he, " ifyou do not go back,
"depend upon it, wherever you go, you will meet with
disasters and disappointments till your father's words arfc
"fulfilled upon you." And so we parted.
I thought at first toreturn home; but shame opposed that
good motion, as thinking I should be laughed at by my neighbours and acquaintance. So strange is the nature of youth,
who are not ashamed to sin, but yet ashamed to repent; and
so far from being ashamed of those actions, for which they
may be accounted fools, they think it folly to return to their
duty, which is the principal mark of wisdom. In short, I
travelled up to London, resolving upon a voyage; and a
voyage I soon heard of, by my acquaintance with a captain
who took a fancy to me, togo to thecoast of Guinea. Hav-
ing some money, and appearing like a gentleman, I went
on board, not as a common sailor or foremast man; nay,
the commander agreed I should go that voyage with him
without any expense; that I should be his messmate and
companion, and I was very welcome to carry any thing
with me, and make the best merchandise I could.
1 blefsed my happy fortune, and humbly thanked my cap-
tain for this offer; and acquainting my friends in Yorkshire,
forty pounds were sent me, the greatest part of which my
dear father and mother contributed to, with which I bought
toys and trifles, as the captain directed me. My captain
also taught me navigation, how to keep an account of the
ship'scourse, take an observation, and led me into the know-
ledge of several useful branches of the mathematics. And
indeed this voyage made me both a sailor and a merchant;
for I brought home five pounds nine ounces of gold-dust for
my adventure, which produced, at my return to London,
almost three hundred pounds. But in this voyage I was ex-
tremely sick, being thrown into a violent calenture through
the excessive heat, trading upon the coast from the latitude
of fifteen degrees north, even to the line itself.
But alas! my dear friend, the captain, soon departed this
life after his arrival. This was a sensible grief to me: yet
1 resolved to go another voyage with his mate, who had
now got command of the ship. This proved a very unsuc-
cdsful one; for though I did not carry quite a hundred
A a
pounds of my late acquired wealth, (so that I had two hun-
dred pounds left, which I reposed with the Captain's widow,
who was an honest gentlewoman) yet my misfortunes in
this unhappy voyage were very great. For our ship sailing
towards the Canary islands, we were chased by a Salee
rover; and in spiteof all the haste we could make, by crowd-
ing as much canvass as our yards could spread, or our masts
carry, the pirate gained upon us, so that we prepared our-
selves to fight. They had eighteen guns, and we had but
twelve. About three in the afternoon there was a desperate
engagement, wherein many were killed and wounded on
both sides; but finding ourselves overpowered with num-
bers, our ship disabled, and ourselves too impotent to have
the least hopes of success, we were forced to surrender; and
accordingly were all carried prisoners into the port of Salee.
Our men were sent to the Emperor's court to be sold there;
but the pirate captain taking notice of me, kept me to be
his own slave.
In this condition, I thought myself the most miserable
creature on earth, and theprophecy of myfathercameairesh
into my thoughts. However, my condition was better than
I thought it to be, as will soon appear. Some hopes indeed
I had that my new patron would go to sea again, where he
might be taken by a Spanish or Portuguese man of war, and
then I should be set at liberty. But in this I was mistaken;
for he never took me with him, but left me to look after his
little garden, and do the drudgery of his house, and when he
returned from sea, would make me lie in the cabin, and
look after the ship. I had no one that I could communicate
my thoughts to, which were continually meditating my
escape; r,o Englishman, Irishman, or Scotchman here, but
myself; and for two years I could see nothing practicable,
but only pleased myself with the imagination.
After some length of time, my patron, as I found, grew so
poor that he could not fit out his ship as usual; and then he
used constantly, once or twice a week, if the weather was
fair,-togo out a fishing, taking me and ayoungMorescoboy
to row the boat; aud so much pleased was he with me for
my dexterity in catching the fish, that he would often send
me with a Moor, who was one of his kinsmen, and the Mo-
resco youth. to catch a dish offish for him.
One morning, as we were at the sport, there arose such
a thick fog, that we lost sight of the shore; and rowing we knew not which way, we laboured all the night, and in the
morning found ourselves in the ocean, two leagues from
land. However, we attained there at length, and made the
greater haste, because ourstomachs were exceedingly sharp
and hungry. In order to prevent such disasters for the
future, my patron ordered a carpenter to build a little state
room or cabin in the middle of the long-boat, with a place
behind it to steer and hale home the main sheet, with other
conveniences to keep in from the weather, as also lockers to
put in all manner of provisions, with a handsome shoulder
of mutton sail, gibing over the cabin.
In this he frequently took us out a fishing; and one time
inviting two or three persons of distinction togo with him,
made provision extraordinary, providing also three fusees,
with powder and shot, that they might have some sport at
fowling along the sea-coast. The next morning the boat
was made clean, her ancient and pendants out, and every
thing ready; but their minds altering, my patron ordered
us to go a fishing, for that his guests would certainly sup
with him that night.
And now I began to think of my deliverance indeed. In
order to this I persuaded the Moor to get some provisions on board, as not daring to meddle with our patron's; and
he taking my advice, we stored ourselves with rusk biscuit,
and three jars of water. Besides, I privately conveyed
into the boat a bottle of brandy, some twine, thread, a ham-
mer, hatchet, and a saw; and, in particular, some bees' wax,
which was a great comfort to me, and served to make can-
dles. I then persuaded Muley (for so was the Moor called)
to procure some powder and shot, pretending to kill seacur-
leus, which he innocently and readily agreed to. In short,
beingprovided with all things necessary, we sailed out, re-
solving for my own part tomake my escape, though itshould
cost me my life.
When we had pafsed the castle, we fell a fishing; but
though I knew there was a bite, I dissembled the matter, in
order to put out further to sea. Accordingly we ran a league
further; when giving the boy the helm, and pretending to
stoop for something, I seized Muley by surprise and threw
him overboard. As he was an excellent swimmer, he soon
arose, and made towards the boat; upon which, I took out
H fusee, and presented at him: "Muley," said 1} " I never
yet designed to do you any harm, and seek nothing now u but my redemption. I know you are able enough to swim
to shore, and save your life; but if you are resolved to
follow me, to the endangering of mine, the very moment
you proceed, I will shoot you through the head." The
harmless creature at these words, turned himself from me,
and I make no doubt got safe to land. Then turning to the
boy Xury, I perceived he trembled at the action; but I put
him out of all fear, telling him, that if he would be true and
faithful to me, I would do well by him. "And therefore,"
said I, "you must stroke yourface to be faithful; and, as the
"Tu iks have learned you, swear by Mahomet, and the beard
of your father, or else I will throw you into the sea also."
So innocent did the child then look, and with such an oblig-
ing smile consented, that I readily believed him, and from
that day forward began to love him entirely.
We then pursued our voyage; and least they should think
me gone to the Straits' mouth, I kept to the southward to
the truly Barbarian coast; but in the duskof the evening, I
changed my course, and steering directly S. and byE. that I
might keep near the shore; and having a fresh gale of wind,
with a pleasant smooth sea, by three o'clock next day I was
onehundredand fifty miles beyond the Emperorof Morocco's
dominions. Yet still having the dreadful apprehension of
being retaken, I continued sailing for five days successively, till such time as the wind shifting to the south ward, made me
conclude, that if any vessel was in chase of me, they would
proceed no farther. After so much fatigue and thought, I
anchored at the mouth of a little river, I knew not what or
where: neitherdidlthenseeany people. What (principally
wanted was fresh water; and I was resolved about dusk to
swim ashore. But no sooner did the gloomy clouds of night
begin to succeed the declining day, when we heard such
barking, roaring, and howling of wild creatures, that one might have thought the very strongest monsters of nature, or
infernal spirits had their residence there. Poor Xury, almost
dead with fear, entreated me not to go on shore that night.
"Supposing I don't, Xury," said I, " and in the morning we
should see men who are worse than those we fear, what
"then?" "O den we may givedemde shoot gun,"repliedXury,
laughing," and de gun makedem all run away."The wit and
brokenEr.^lish which the boy had learned among the captives
of our nation, pleased me entirely; and to add to his cheer-
fulnfcfs, I gave him a dram of the bottle: we could get but little sleep all the night for those terrible bowlings they made;
and, indeed, we were both very much affrighted, when, by
the rollings of the water, and other tokens, we justly con-
cluded one of those monsters made towards our boat. I could
not see, till it came within two oars' length, when taking my
fusee, I let fly at him. Whether I hit him or no, I cannot
tell; but he made towards the shore, and the noise of my
gun increased the stupendous noise of the monsters.
The next morning I was resolved to go on shore to get
fresh water, and venture my life among the beastser savages,
should either attack me. Xury said, he would take one of
the jars and bring me some. I asked him, why he would
go, and not I? The poor boy answered, "If wild manscome,
they eat me, you go away." A mind scarcely now to be
imitated, so contrary to self-preservation, the most powsrful
law of Nature. This indeed increased my affection to the
child. "Well, dearXury," said I, "we will both go ashore,
both kill wild mans, and they shall eat neither of us." So
giving Xury a piece of rusk-bread to eat, and a dram, we
waded ashore, carrying nothing with us but our arms, and
two jars for water. I did not go out of sight of the boat, as
dreading the savages coming down the river in their canoes;
but the boy seeing a low descent or vale about a mile in the
country, he wandered to it: and then running back to me
with great precipitation, I thought he was pursued by some
savage or wild beast; upon which I approached, resolving
to perish or protect him from danger. As he came nearer
to me, I saw something hanging over his shoulders, which
was a creature he had shot like a hare, but different in colour,
and longer legs; however we were glad of it, for it proved
wholesome and nourishing meat: but what added to our joy
was, my boy assured me there was plenty of water, and that
he xenonutidmans. And greater still was our comfort, when
the tide was out, without going so far up into the country.
In this place I began to consider that the Canary and Cape
de Verde islands lay not far off; but having no instrument, I knew not what latitude, or when to stand off to sea for
them; yet my hopes were I should meet some of the Eng-
lish trading vessels, who would relieve and take us in.
The place I was in was no doubt that wild country, in-
habited only by a few, that lies between the Emperor of
Morocco's dominions and the Negroes. It is filled with
wild beasts, and the Moors use it for hunting caierly. From 'this place I thought I saw the top of the mountain Teneriff
in the Canaries; which made me try twice to attain it;
-but as often was I drove back, and so forced to pursue my
fortune along shore.
Early one morning we came to an anchor under a little
point of land, but pretty high; and the tide beginning to
*ow, we lay ready to go further in. But Xury, whose
youthful and penetrating eyes were sharper than mine, in a
softione, desired me to keep far from land, lest we should
be devoured. "For look yonder, mayter," said he, " and see
de dreadful monster fast asleep on de side of de hill."—.
Accordingly looking where he pointed, I espied a fearful
monster indeed. It was a terrible great lion that lay on
shore, covered as it were by a shade of a piece of the hill.
"Xury," said I, " you shall go on shore and kill him." But
the'boy looked amazed: "Me kill him !" says he, ''he eat
me at one mouth;" meaning one mouthful. Upon which I
bid him lie still, and charging my biggest gun with two slugs, and a good charge of powder, I took the best aim I
could to shoot him through the head, but his leg lying over
his nose, the slug broke his knee-bone. The lion awaking
with the pain, got up, but soon fell down, giving the most
hideous groan I ever heard: but taking my second piece,
I shot him through the head, and then he lay struggling for
life. Upon this Xury took heart, and desired my leave to
go on shore. "Go then," said I. Upon which taking a
little gun in one hand, he swam to shore with the other, and coming close to the lion, put a period to his life by shooting
him again through the head.
But this was spending our ammunition in vain, the flesh
not being good to eat. Xury was like a champion, and
comes on board for a hatchet, to cut off the head of his ene-
my; but not having strength to perform it, he cut off and
brought me a foot. I bethought me, however, that his skin
would be of use. This work cost Xury and me a whole
day; when spreading it on the top of our cabin the hot
beams of the sun effectually dried it in two days time, and
it afterwards served me for a bed to lie on.
And now we sailed southerly, living sparingly on our pro-
visions, and wentnooftener on shore than we were obliged
for fresh water. My design was to make the river Gambia
or Senegal, or any where about the Cape de Verde, in hopes
to meet some European ship. If Providence did not so fit-
vour me, my next course was to seek for the islands, or lose my life among the Negroes. And,. in a word, I put my
whole stress upon this, "Either that "I must meet with
some ship or certainly perish."
One day as we were sailing along, we saw people stand.
on the shore looking at us; we could also perceive they
were black and stark naked. I was inclined to go on »liore»
butXury cried, "No, no;" however, I approached nearer,
and I found they run along the shore by me a good way.
They had no weapons in their hands, except one, who held
a long stick, which Xury told me was a lance, with which
they could kill at a great distance. I talked to them by signs
and made them sensible I wanted something to eat; they beckoned me to stop my boat, while two of them ran up into the country, and in less than half an hour came back,
and brought with them two pieces of dried flesh, and some
corn, which we kindly accepted; and to prevent any fears
on either side, they brought the food to the shore, laid it
down, then went and stood a great way off till we fetched
it on board, and then came close to us again.
But while we were returning thanks to them, being all we
could afford, two mighty creatures camefrom the mountains;
one as it were pursuing the other with great fury, which we
were the rather inclined to believe, as they seldom appear
but in the night; and both these swiftly pafsing by the ne-
groes, jumped into the sea, wantonly swimming about, as
tho' the'divcrsionof the waters had put a stop to their fierce-
ftefs. At last one of diem coming nearer to my boat than I
expected or desired, I shot him directly thro' the head; upon
which he sunk immediately, yet rising again, would have
willingly made the shore; but between the wound and the
strangling of the water, he died before he could reach it.
It.isimpoisible to express the consternation the poor Ne-
groes were in at the firing of my gun; much less can I men-
tion their surprise, when they perceived the creature to be
slain by it. I made signs to them to draw near it with a
rope, and then gave it them to hale on shore. It was a beau-
tiful leopard, which made me desire its skin: and the Ne-
groes seeming to covet the.carcase, I freely gave it to them.
As for the other leopard, it made to shore, and ran with pro-
digious swiftness out of sight. The Negroes having kindly
furmshed me with water, and with what roots and grains
their country afforded, I took my leave, and, after eleven*
days sail, came in sight of the Cape de Verde, and those islands called by its name. But thegreatdistancel was from
it, and fearing contrary winds would prevent my reaching
them, I began to grow melancholy and dejected, when, upon
a sudden, Xury cried out, " Master! Master! a ship with a
sail!" and looked as affrighted as if it was his master's ship
sent in search of us. But 1 soon discovered she was a Por-
tuguese ship, as I thought bound to the coast of Guinea for
Negroes. Upon which I strove for life to come up to them.
But vain had it been, if through their perspective glasses they
had not perceived me, and shortened their sail to letmecome
up. Encouraged at this, I set up my patron's ancient, and
fired a gun, both as signals of distress; upon which they
very kindly lay to, so that in three hours time I came up
with them. They spoke to me in Portuguese, Spanish, and
French, but neither of these did I understand; till at length
a Scots sailor called, and then I told him I was an English-
man, who had escaped from the Moors at Salee; upon
which they took me kindly on board, with all my effects.
Surely none can express the inconceivable joy I felt at
this happy deliverance! who from being a late miserable
and forlorn creature, was not only relieved, but in favour
with the master of the ship, to whom, in return for my de-
liverance, I offered all I had. "God forbid," said he,
"that I should take any thing from you. Every thing shall
be delivered to you when you come to Brazil. Ifl have
saved your life, it is no more than I should expect to re-
"ceive myself from any other, when in the same circum-
"stances I should happen to meet the like deliverance.—
"And should I take from you what you have, and leave you
at Brazil, why, this would be only taking away a life I
had given. My charity teaches me better. Those effects
"you have will support you there, and provide you a pat
"sage home again." And, indeed, he acted with the strict-
est justice in what he did, taking my thingsjnto his possession, and giving me an exact inventory, even to my earthen
jars. He bought my boat of me for the ship's use, giving
me a note of eighty pieces of eight, payable at Brazil; and
if any body offered more he would make it up. He also
gave me sixty pieces for my boy Xury. It was with great
reluctance 1 was prevailed upon to sell the child's liberty,
who hud seived me so faithfully; but the boy was willing
himself; and it was agreed, that after ten years he should
4
be made free, upon his renouncing Mahometanism, and
embracing Christianity.
Having a pleasant voyage to the Brazils, we arrived in
the Bay de Todos los Santos, or All Saints' Bay, in twenty
two days after. And here I cannot forget the generous
treatment of the captain. He would take nothing for my
pafsage, gave me twenty ducats for the leopard's skin, and
thirty for the lion's. Every thing he caused to be delivered,
and what I would sell he bought. In short I made about
220 pieces of my cargo; and with this stock I entered
once more, as I may say, into the scene of life.
Being recommended to an honest planter, I lived with
him till such time as I was informed of the manner of their
planting and making sugar; and seeing how well they
lived, and how suddenly they grew rich, I was filled with a
desire to settle among them, and resolved to get my money
remitted to me, and to purchase a plantation.
To be brief, I bought a settlement next door to an honest
and kind neighbour, born at Lisbon, of English parents, whose plantation joining to mine, we improved it very ami-
cably together. Both our stocks were low, and for two
years we planted only for food: but the third year we
planted some tobacco, and each of us drelsed a large piece
of ground the ensuing year for planting canes. But now
I found how much I wanted assistance, and repented the
loss of my dear boy Xary.
Having none to assist me, my father's words came into
my mind; and I used to ask myself, if what I sought was
only a middle station ol'life, why could it not as well be ob-
tained in England as here? When I pondered on this with
regret, the thoughts of my late deliverance forsook me. I
had none to converse with but my neighbour; no work to be
done but by my own hands; it often made me say, my con-
dition was like to that of a man cast upon a desolate island.
So unhappy are we in our reflections, so forgetful of what
good things we receive ourselves, and so unthankful for
our deliverance from those calamities that others endure.
I was in some measure settled, before the captain who
took me up departed from the Brazils. One day I went to
him, and told him what stock I had in London, desiring his
assistance in getting it remitted; to which the good gentle-
man readily consented, but would only have me send for half my money, lest it should miscarry; which, if it did, L
fi
might still have the remainder to support me: and so taking
letters of procuration of me, bid me trouble myself no far-
ther about it.
And indeed wonderful was his kindness towards me; for
he not only procured the money I had drawn for upon my
captain's widow, but sent me over a servant with a cargo
proportionable to my condition. He also sent me over
tools of all sorts, iron-work, and utensils necessary for my
plantation, which proved to be of the greatest use to me
in my business.
Wealth now accumulating on me, and uncommon success crowning my prosperous labours, I might have rested happy
in that middle state of life my father had so often recom-
mended: yet nothing would content me, such was my evil
genius, but I must leave this happy station, for a foolish am-
bition in rising; and thus, once more, I cast myself into the
greatest gulph of misery that ever poor creature fell into.
Having lived four years in Brazil, I had not only learned
the language, but contracted acquaintance with the most
eminent planters, and even the merchants of St. Salvador;
to whom, once, by way of discourse, having given account
of my two voyages to the coast of Guinea, and the manner
of trading there for mere trifles, by which we furnish our
plantations with negroes, they gave such attention to what I
said that three of them came one morning to me, and told
me they had a secret proposal to make. After enjoining me
to secresy (it being an infringementon the powers of the
kings of Portugal and Spain) they told me they had a mind
to fit out a ship to go to Guinea, in order to stock the plan-
tation with Negroes, which as they could not be publicly
.sold, they would divide among them; and if I would go
their supercargo in the ship to manage the trading part, I
should have an equal share of the Negroes, without provid-
ing any stock. The thing indeed was fair enough had I
been in another condition. But I was born to be my own
destroyer, could not resist the proposal, but accepted the of-
fer upon condition of their looking after my plantation. So
making a formal will, I bequeathed my effects to my good
friend the captain, as my universal heir; but obliged him to dispose of my effects as directed, one half of the produce
to himself, and the other to be shipped to England.
The ship being fitted out, and all things ready, we set
sail the first oi September, 1659, being the same dayeigh:
years I left my father and mother in Yorkshire. We sailed
northward upon the coast, in order to gain Africa, till we
made Cape Augustine; from whence going farther into the
ocean, out of sight of land, we steered as though we were
bound for the isle Fernand de Norenba, leaving the islands
on the east; and then it was that we met with a terrible
tempest, which continued for twelve days succefsively, so
that the winds carried us wheresoever they pleased. In this
perplexity one of our men died, and one man and a boy
were washed overboard. When the weather cleared up a
little, we found ourselves eleven degrees north latitude, upon
the coast of Guinea. Upon this the captain gave reasons
for returning; which I opposed, counselling him to stand
away for Barbadoes, which, as I supposed, mtght beattained
in fifteen days. So altering our course, we sailed north-
west and by west, in order to reach the Leeward islands ; -
but a second storm succeeding, drove us to the westward;
so that we were justly afraid of falling into the hands of
cruel savages, or the paws of devouring beasts of prey.
In this great distress, one of our men, early in the morn-
ing cried out, " Land, land!" which he had ho sooner cried
out, but our ship struck upon a sand-bank, and in a moment
the sea broke over her in such a manner, that we expected
we should all have perished immediately. We knew no-
thing where we were, or upon what land we were driven;
whetheran island or the main, inhabited or not inhabited;
and we could not so much as hope that the ship would hold out
many minutes, without breaking in pieces, except the wind
by a miracle, should turn about immediately. While we
stood looking at one another, expect ing death every moment,
the mate lays hold of the boat, and with the help of the rest
got her flung over the ship's side, and getting all into her,
being eleven of us, committed ourselves to God's mercy and
the wild sea. And now we saw that this last effort would
not be sufficient protection from death; so high did the sea
rise, that it was impofsible the boat should live. As to
making sail, we had none; neither if we had could we
make use of any. So that when we had rowed, or rather
were driven about a league and a half, a raging wave, like
a lofty mountain, came rolling a-stern of us, and took us
with such fury, that at once it overset the boat. Thus being
swallowed up in a moment, we had hardly time to call upon
the tremendous nameof God; much less to implore, in dying
ejaculations, hisinfinite mercy to receive our departing souU.
Men are generally counted insensible when struggling in
the pangs of death; but while I was overwhelmed with
water, I had the most dreadful apprehensions imaginable.
For the joys of heaven and the torments of hell, seemed to
present themselves before me in these dying agonies, and
even small space of time, as it were, between life and death.
I was going I thought I knew not whither, into a dismal
gulph unknown, and as yet unperceived, never to behold
my friends, nor the light of this world any more! Could I
even have thought of annihilation, ora total dissolution of
soul as well as body, the gloomy thoughts of having no far-
ther bemg, no knowledge of what we hoped for, but an
cternai quietus, without life or sense: even that, I say,
\vou!d lnwe been enough to strike me with horror and con-
fusion! I strove, however, to the last extremity, while all
my companions were overpowered and entombed in the
tieep: and it was with great difficulty I kept my breath till
the wave spent itself, and retiring back, left me on the shore
half dead with the water I had taken in. As soon as I got
on my feet, I ran as fast as I could, least another wave
should pursue me, and carry me back again. But for all
the haste 1 made, I could not avoid it: for the sea came
after me like a high mountain, or furious enemy; so that
my business was to hold my breath, and by raising myself
on the water, preserve it by swimming. The next dread-
ful wave buried me at once twenty or thirty feet deep but at
the same time carried me with a mighty force and swiftness toward the shore; when raising myself, I held out as well
as possible, till at length the water having spent itself, be-
gan to return, at which I struck forward and feeling ground
with my feet, I took to my heels again. Thus being served
twice more, I was at length dashed against a piece of rock,
in such a manm.r as left me senseless; but recovering a
little before the return of the wave, which, no doubt, would
then have overwhelmed me, I held fast by the rock till those
succeeding waves abated; and then fetching another run,
was overtaken by a small wave, which was soon conquered.
But before any more could overtake me, I reached the main
land, where clamberingup the cliffs of the shore, tired and
jilmost spent I sat down on the grass, free from the dangers
of the foaming ocean.
No tongue can express the ecstasies and transports that
my sou! felt at the happy deliverance. It was like a reprieve to a dying malefactor, with a halter about his neck, and
ready to be turned off. I was wrapt up in contemplation,
and often lifted up my hands, with the profoundest humility,
to the Divine Powers, for saving my life, when the rest of
my companions were all drowned. And now I began to
cast my eyes around, to behold what place I was in, and
what I had next to do. I could see no house nor people; I
was wet, yet had no clothes to shift me; hungry and thirsty,
yet had nothing to cat or drink; no weapon to destroy any
creature for my sustenance, nor defend myself against de-
vouring beasts; in short, I had nothing but a knife, a
tobacco-pipe, and a box half filled with tobacco. The
darksome night coming on upon me, increased my fears of
being devoured by wild creatures; my mind was plunged
in despair, and having no prospect, as I thought, of life be-
fore me, I prepared for another kind of death than what I
had lately escaped. I walked about a furlong to see if I
could find any fresh water, which I did to my great joy:
and taking a quid of tobacco to prevent hunger, I got up
into a thick bushy tree, and seating myself so that I could
not fall, a deep sleep overtook me, and for that night buried
my sorrows in a quiet repose.
It was broad day the next morning before I awaked;
when I not only perceived the tempest was ceased, but saw
the ship driven almost as far as the rock before-mentioned,
which the waves had dashed me against, and which was about a mile from the place where I was. When I came
down from my apartment in the tree, I perceived the ship's
Loat two miles distant on my right-hand, lying on shore, as
the waves had cast her. I thought to have got to her; but
there being an inlet of water of about half a mile's breadth
between it and me, I returned again towards the ship, as
hoping to find something for my more immediate subsistence.
About noon, when the sea was calm, that I. could come
within a quarter of a mile of her, it was to my grief that I perceived, that if we had kept on board all our lives had
been saved. These thoughts, and my solitude, drew tears
from my eyes, though all in vain. So resolving to get to
the ship, I stripped and leapt into the water, when swim-
ming round her, I was afraid I should not get any thing to
lay hold of; but it was my good fortune to espy a small piece of rope hang down by the fore-chains, so low that, by
the help of it, though with great difficulty, I got into u*«.
forecastle of the ship. Here I found that the ship was
bulged, and had a great deal of water in her hold; her stern
was lifted up against a bank, and her head almost to the
water. All her quarter, and what was there, was free and
dry. The provisions I found in good order, with which I
crammed my pockets, and losing no time, ate while I was
doing other things; I also found some mm, of which I took
a hearty dram; and now I wanted for nothing except a
boat, which indeed was all, to carry away what was need-
ful for me.
Necessity occasions quickness of thought. We had se-
veral spare yards, a spare topmast or two, and two or three
large spars of wood. With these I fell to work, and slung
as many of them overboard as I could manage, tying every
one of them with a rope, that they might not drive away.
This done, I went'down to the ship's side, and tied four of
them fast together at both ends, in form of a raft, and laying
two or three short pieces of plank upon them crosswise, I
found it would bear me, but not any considerable weight.
Upon which I went to work again, cutting a spare topmast
into three lengths, adding them to my raft with a great deal
of labour and pains. I then considered what I should load
it with, it being not able to bear a ponderous burden. And
this I SQon thought of, first laying upon it all the planks and
boards I.could get; next I lowered down three of the sea-
men's chests, after 1 had filled them with bread, rice, three
Dutch cheeses, five pieces of dried goat's flesh, and some
European corn, what little the rats had spared; and for
liquors, I found several cases of bottles belonging to our
skipper, in which were some cordial waters, and four or
rive gallons of rack, which I stowed by themselves. By
this time the tide beginning to flow, I perceived my coat,
waistcoat, and shirt, swim away, which I had left on the
shore; as for my linen-breeches and stockings, I swam with
them to the ship; but I soon found clothes enough, though I
took no more than I wanted for the present. My eyes were
chiefly on tools to work with; and, after a long search, I
found out the carpenter's chest, which I got safe down on my
raft. I then looked for arms and ammunition, and in the
great cabin found two good fowling-pieces, two pistols, se-
veral powder-horns filled, a small bag of shot, and two old
rusty swords. I likewise found three barrels of powder,
two of which were good, but the third had taken water, also two or three broken oars, two saws, an ax, and a ham-
mer. I then put to sea, and in getting to shore had three
encouragements. I. A smooth calm sea. 2. The tide
rising and setting in to shore. 3. The little wind there was
blew towards the land. After I had sailed about a mile, I
found the raft to drive a little distance from the place where
I first landed; and then I perceived a little opening of the
land, with a strong current of the tide running into it: up-
on which I kept the middle of the stream. But great was
my concern, when on a sudden the forepart of my raft ran
aground, so that had I not, with great difficulty, for near
half an hour, kept my back straining against the chests to
keep my effects in their places, all I had would have gone
into the sea. But after some time, the rising of the water
caused the raft to float again, and coming up a little river
with land on both sides, I landed in a little cave, as near the
mouth as possible, the better to discover a sail, if any such
providentially pafsed that way.
Not far off, I espied a hill of stupendous height, sur-
rounded with lefser hills about it, and thither I was resolved
to go and view the country, that I might see what part
was best to fix my habitation. Accordingly, arming my-
self with a pistol, a fowling-piece, powder and ball, I as-
cended the mountain. There I perceived I was in an
island, encompassed by the sea; no distant lands to be seen
but scattering rocks that lay to the west: that it seemed to
be a barren place, and as I thought, inhabited only by wild
beasts. I perceived abundance of fowls, but ignorant of
what kind, or whether good for nourishment; I shot one of
them at my return, which occasioned a confused screaming
among the other birds, and I found it by its colour and beak
to be a kind of hawk, but its flesh was perfect carrion.
When I came to my raft, 1 brought. my effects on shore,
which work spent that day entirely; and fearing that some
cruel beasts might devour me in the night time while I slept, I
made a kind of hut or barricade with the chests and boards
I had brought on shore. That night I slept very comfort-
ably; and the next morning my thoughts were employed to
make a further attempt on the ship, and bring away what
necelsaries 1 could find, before another storm should break
her to pieces. Accordingly I got on board as before, and
prepared a second raft far more nice than the first, upon
which I brought away the carpenter's stores, two o"r three
bags full of nails, a great jack-screw, a dozen or two of
hatchets, and a grind-stone. I also took away several things
that belonged to the gunner, particularly two or three iron
crows, two barrels of musket-bullets, another fowling-piece,
a small quantity of powder, and a large bagful of small shot.
Besides these, I took all the men's clothes I could find, a
spare fore top-sail, a hammock, and some bedding; and
thus completing my second cargo, I made all the haste to
shore I could, fearing some wild beast might destroy what
I had there already. But I only found a little wild cat
sitting on one of the chests, which seeming not to fear me
or the gun that I presented at her, I threw her a piece of
biscuit, which she instantly ate and departed.
When I had gotten these effects on shore, I went to work,
in order to make me a little tent with the sail and some poles
which I had cut for that purpose; and having finished it,
what things might be damaged by the weather I brought
in, piling all the empty chests and casks in a circle, the better to fortify it against any sudden attempt of man or
beast. After this I blocked up the doors with some boards,
and an empty chest, turned the long way out. I then charged my gun and pistol, and laying my bed on the
fround, slept as comfortably, till next morning, as though I
had been in a Christian country.
Now, though I had enough to subsist me along time, yet
despairing of a sudden deliverance, or that both ammunition
and provision might be spent before such thing happened, I
coveted as much as I could; and so long as the ship re-
mained in that condition, I daily brought away one neces-
sary or other; particularly the rigging, sails, and cordage,
some twine, a barrel of wet powder, some sugar, a barrel
of meal, three casks of rum, and, what indeed was most
welcome to me, a whole hogshead of bread.
The next time I went I cut the cables in pieces, carried
off a hawser whole, with a great deal of iron-work, and
made another raft with the mizen and sprit-sajl-yard; but
this being so unwieldy, by the too heavy burden I had upon
it, and not being able so dextrously to-guide it as the former,
both my cargo and I were overturned. For my part, all
the damage I sustained was a wet skin; and, at low water,
after much labour in diving, I got most of the cables, aud
some pieces of iron.
'
Thirteen days I had now been in the island, and eleven
times on board, bringing away all that was possible; and I believe had the weather been calm, I should have brought
away the whole ship piece by piece. As I was going the
twelfth time, the wind began to rise; however, I ventured
at low water, and rummaging the cabin, in a locker I found
several razors, scifsors, and some dozens of knives and
forks; and in another thirty-six pounds of pieces of eight,
silver and gold. "Ah! simple vanity," said I, "whom
this world so much doats on, where is now thy virtue, thy
excellency to me? You cannot procure me one thing
"needful, nor remove me from this desolate island to a
place of plenty. One of these knives, so meanly esteemed,
is to me more preferable than all this heap. E'en there-
"fore remain where thou art, to sink in the deep as unre-
"garded, even as a creature whose life is not worth preserv-
"ing." Yet, after all this exclamation, 1 wrapt it up in a
piece of canvass, and began to think of making another raft:
but I soon perceived the wind began to arise, a fresh gale
blowing from the shore, and the sky overcast with clouds
and darkness; so thinking a raft to be in vain, I let myself
into the water, with what things I had about me, and it was
with much difficulty I got ashore, when soon after it blew a
fearful storm.
That night I slept very contentedly in my little tent, sur-
rounded with all my effects; but when I looked out in the
morning no more ship was to be seen. This much sur-
prised me forthe present; yet, when I considered I had lost
no time, abated no pains, and had got every thing useful
out of her, I comforted myself in the best manner, and en-
tirely submitted to the will of Providence.
My next thoughts were, how I should defend and secure
myself from savages and wild beasts, if any such were in
the island. At one time I thought of digging a cave, at
another I was for erecting a tent; and, at length, I resolved
to do both: the manner or form of which will not, I hope,
be unpleasing to describe.
When I considered the ground where I was, that it was
moorish, and had no fresh water near it, my resolutions
were to search for a soil healthy and well watered, where I
might not only be sheltered from the sun's scorching heat,
but be more conveniently situated, as well to be secured
from wild men and beasts of prey, as more easily to dis-
cover any distant sail, should it ever so happen.
And, indeed, it was not long before I had my desire. I
found a little plain near a rising hill, the front towards
which being as steep as a house-side, nothing could descend
on me from the top. On the side of this rock was a little
hollow place, resembling the entrance or door of a cave.
Just before this place, on the circle of the green, I resolved
sny tent should stand. This plain did not much exceed
a hundred yards broad, and about twice as long, like a de-
Jightfu! green before my door, with a pleasing, though an
irregular descent every way to the low grounds by the sea-
-side, lying on the N. W. side of the hill, so that it was
sheltered from the excessive heat of the sun. After this, I
drew a semicircle, containing ten yards in a semi-diameter,
and twenty yards in the whole, driving down two rows of
strong stakes, not six inches from each other. Then with a
piece of cable which I had cut on board, I regularly laid
them in a circle between the piles up to their tops, which
were more than five feet out of the earth, and after drove
another row of piles looking within side against them, be-
tween two or three feet high, which made me conclude it a
little impregnable castle against men and beasts. And for
my better security I would have no door, but entered in and
came out by the help of a ladder, which I also made.
Here was my fence and fortress, into which I carried all
my riches, ammunition and stores. After which, working
on the rock, what with dirt and stones I dug out, 1 not
only raised my ground two feet, but made a little cellar to
my mansion-house; and this cost me many days labour and
pains. One day in particular a shower or rain falling,
thunder and lightning ensued, which put me in terror lest
my powder should take fire, and not only hinder my ne-
cefsary subsistence, my killing me food, but even blow up
Bie and my habitation. To prevent which, I fell to making
boxes and bags, in order to separate it, having by me near
150lb. weight. And thus being established as king of the
island, every day I went out with my gun to see what I
could kill that was fit to eat. I soon perceived numbers of
goats, but very shy; yet having watched them narrowly,
and seeing I could better shoot off the rocks than when in
the low grounds, I happened to shoot a she goat suckling a
young kid; which not thinking its dam slain, stood by her
unconcerned: and when I took the dead creature up, the
young one followed me even to the inclosure. I lifted the
Jcid over the pales, and would willingly have kept it alive;
but finding it could not be brought to eat, I was forced to
slay it also for my subsistence.
Thus entering into as strange a scene of life as ever any
man was in, I had most melancholy apprehensions concern-
ing my deplorable condition: and many times the tears
would plentifully run down my face, when I considered
how I was debarred from all communication with human
kind. Yet while these desponding cogitations would seem
to make me accuse Providence, other good thoughts would
interpose and reprove me after this manner: Well, suppos-
ing you are desolate, is it not better to be so than totally
perish? Why were you singled out to be saved, and the rest
destroyed? Why should you complain, when not only your
life is preserved, but the ship driven even into your reach, in
order to take what was necefsary out of her for your subsistence? But to proceed. It was, by the account I kept,
the 30th of September, when I first landed on this Island.
About twelve days after, fearing least I should lose my
reckoning of time, nay, even forget the Sabbath days, for
want of pen, ink, and paper, I carved with a knife upon a
large post, in great letters, and set it up, in the similitude of
a cross, on the sea-shore where I landed, / came on shore,
Se/it. 30, 1659. Every day I cut a notch with my knife on
the sides of this square post, and that on the Sabbath was as
long again as the rest; and every first day of the month as
long again as that long one. In this manner I kept my ca-
lendar, weekly, monthly, or yearly reckoning of time. But
had I made a more strict search (as afterwards I did) I
needed not have set up this mark; for among the parcels
belonging to the gunner, carpenter, and captain's mate, I
found those very things I wanted; particularly pens, ink,
and paper; also I found two or three compafses, some ma-
thematical instruments, dials, perspective glasses, books of
navigation, three English Bibles, and several other good
books, which I carefully put up.—Here I cannot but call to
mind our having a dog and two cats on board, whom I
made inhabitants with me in my castle. Though one might
think I had all the necessaries that were desirable, yet still
I found several.things wanting. My ink was daily wasting;
I wanted needles, pins, and thread to men•* or keep my
clothes together; and particularly a spade, pickax, or
shovel, to remove the earth. It was a year before I finished my little bulwark; and having some intervals of relaxation,
after my daily wandering abroad for provision, I drew up
this plan, alternately, as creditor and debtor, to remind me
of the miseries and blessings of my life, under so many
various circumstances.
EVIL.
/ am cast upw a des'late
istand, having no hojits, no pro-
spec t of a. welcome deliverance.
. How miserable am I singled
out from the enjoyment or company
of all mankind.
Like an hermit (rather should
I say a lonety anchorite) am I
forced from human conversation.
My clothes after tome time
will be twin out; and then I
shall have none to covet me.
When my ammunition is
wasted, then shalt 1 remain
without any dtfenee against wild
men and beasts.
I have no creature, no soul
to fpe.uk to; nine to beg afsist-
ancefnm. Some ccmfoit would
it be to resound my woes where
I am understood, and beg as-
sistance•whet e 1 might hope for
relief.
GOOD.
But yet I am preserved,
while my companions are pe-
rished in the raging ocean.
Yet set apart to be spared
from death. And he, who has
so preserved me, can deliver me
ft am this condiuon.
Hotoever, I have food to eat,
and even a happy prospect of
subsistence whilst life endures.
At present I enjoy tuliaf is
absolutely needful; and the cli-
mate is so hot, that had I never
so many, I should hardly wear
tliem.
Yet if it does, I see nt dan-
ger of any hurt to me, as in
Africa: and what if 1 had
been cast away upon that coast.
Is there not God to converse
to, and is not he able to re-
lieve thee? Already has he
afforded thee sustenance, and
put it in thy power to pr'videfor
thysetf till he tends thee a de-
liverance.
And now easing my mind a little by these reflections,
I began to render my life as easy as pofsible.
I must here add, to the description I have given of my
habitation, that having raised a turf-wall against the outside
of it, I thatched it so close, as might keep it from the incle-
mency of the weather; I also improved it within, enlarged
my cave, and made a passage and door in the rock, which
came out beyond the pale of my fortification. I next pro-
ceeded to make a chair and a table, and so he^an to study
such mechanical arts as seemed to me practicable. VVbeo
I wanted a plank or board, I hewed down a tree with my
hatchet, making it as thin with my ax as possible, and then
smooth enough with an adz to answer my designs: yet
though I could make no more this way than one board out
of a tree, in length of time I got boards enough to shelter
all my stores, every thing being regularly placed, and my
guns securely hanging against the side of the rock. This
made it a very pleasant sight to me, as being the result of
vast labour and diligence; which leaving for a while, and
me to the enjoyment of it, I shall give the reader an account
of my Journal from the day of my landing, till the fixing
and settling «f my habitation, as heretofore shown.
JOURNAL.
30th, 1659, I, unhappy Robinson Crusoe,
having suffered shipwreck, was driven on this desolate
Island, which I named the Desolate Island of Despair, my
companions being swallowed up in the tempestuous ocean.
The next day I spent in consideration of my unhappy cir-
cumstances, having no prospect butof death, either to be
starved with hunger, or devoured with beasts or merciless savages.
Oct. 1. That morning, with great comfort I beheld the
ship drove ashore. Some hopes I had, that when the stc rm
was abated, I might be able to get some food and neces-
saries out of her, which I conceived were not damaged, be-
cause the ship did stand upright. At this time I lamented
the loss of my companions, and our misfortune in leaving the
vefsel. When I perceived the ship as it were lie dry, I
waded through the sands, then swam aboard, the weather
being very rainy, and with scarcely any wind.
To the 14.th of this month, my time was employed in
making voyages, every tide getting what I could out of the
ship. The weather very wet and uncertain.
Oct. 20. My raft and all the goods thereon were over-
set; yet I recovered most again at low water.
Oct. 25. It blew hard, and rained night and day, when the ship went in pieces, so that nothing was seen of her but
the wreck at low water. This day 1 stcured my goods from the inclemency of the weather.
C
Oct. 26. I wandered to see where I cquld find a place
convenient for my abode. I fixed upon a rock in the even-
ing, marked out a half-moon, intending to erect a wall^
fortified with piles, lined within with pieces of cables, and
covered with turf.
Nov. 1. I erected my tent under a rock, and took up
my lodgings very contentedly in a hammock that night. Nov. 2. This day I fenced myself in with timber, chests,
and boards.
Nov. 3. I shot two wild fowl, resembling ducks, which
were good to eat, and in the afternoon made me a table.
Nov. 4.. I began to live regularly. In the morning I
allowed myself two or three hours to walk out with my gun;
I then worked till near eleven o'clock, and afterwards re-
freshed myself with what I had to eat. From twelve to
two I would lie down to sleep. Extremely sultry weather.
In the evening go to work again.
Nov. 5. Went out with my gun and dog, shot a wild
cat with a soft skin, but her flesh was good for nothing.
The skins of those I killed, I preserved. In my return, I
perceived many wild birds, and was terrified by some seals,
which made off to sea.
Nov. 6. Completed my table.
Nov. 7. Fair weather. I worked till the 12th, but
omitted the ] 1th, which, according to my calculation, I sup-
posed to be Sunday.
Nov. 13. Rain in abundance, which, however, much cooled the air; with thunder and lightning, caused in me a terrible surprise. The weather clearing, I secured my pow-
der in separate parcels.
Nov. 14—16. I made little boxes for my powder, lodg-
ing them in several places. I also shot a large fowl, which
proved excellent meat.
Nov. 17. I began to dig in the rock, yet was obliged to
desist for want of a pickax, shovel, and wheelbarrow. Iron
crows I caused to supply the place of the first j but with all
my art I could not make a wheelbarrow.
Nov. 18. It was my fortune to find a tree, resembling
vvhat Brazilians call an iron-tree. I had like to have spoiled
my ax with cutting it, being very hard and exceedingly
heavy; yet with much labour and industry, I made a sort,
qf a'spade out of it.
Nov. 23. These tools being made, I daily carried on my
business; eighteen days I allowed for enlarging my cave,
that it might serve me, not only for a warehouse, but kit-
chen, parlour, and cellar. I commonly lay in the tent, un-
lefs the weather was rainy that I could not lie dry. So wet
would it be at certain seasons, that I was obliged to cover
all within the pale with long poles, in the form of rafters,
leaning against the rock, and loaded them with flags and
large leaves of trees, resembling a thatch.
Dec. 10. No sooner did I think my habitation finished,
but suddenly a great deal of the top broke in, so that it was
a mercy I was not buried in the ruins. This occasioned a
great deal of pains and trouble tome, before I could make it firm and durable.
Dec. 17. I nailed up some shelves, and drove nails and
staples in the wall and posts, to hang things out of the way.
Dec. 20 Evey thing I got into its place, then made a sort
of a dresser, and another table. Dec. 24, 25. Rain in abundance. Dec. 26. Very fair weather.
Dec. 27. I chanced to light on some goats, shot one, and
wounded another. I led it home in a string, bound up its
leg, and cured it in a little time; at length it became so
tame and familiar as to feed before the door, and follow me where I pleased. This put me in mind to bring up tame
creatures, in order to supply me with food after my ammunition was spent.
Dec. 28, 29,30. The weather being excefsively hof,
with little air, obliged me for the most part, to keep within
doors.
Jan. 1. Still sultry, however, obliged by necessity, I went
out with my gun, and found a great store of goats in the valleys; they were exceedingly shy, nor could my dog
hunt them down.
Jan. 3 to 14. My employment this time was to finish the
wall before described, and search the island. I discovered
a kind of pigeons, like our house pigeons, in a nest among the
rocks. I brought them home, nursed them till they coulil
fly, and then they left me. After this, I shot some, which.
proved excellent food. Some time I spent vainly in con-
triving to make a cask; I may well say it was vain, because
I could neither joint the staves, nor fix the heads, so as to
make it tight: So, leaving that, took some goat's talloyv .I
had about me, and a little oakum for the wick, and provided.
myself with a lamp, which served me instead of candles.
Cr '. J
But now a very strange event happened. For being in
the height of my search, what should come into my hand,
but a bag, which used to hold corn (as I supposed) for the
fowls; so immediately resolving to put gunpowder in it, I
shook all the husks and dirt upon one side of the rock, little
expecting what the consequence would be. The rain had
fallen plentifully a few days before: and about a month
after, to my great amazement, something began to look out
very green and flourishing; and when I came to view it
more nicely every day as it grew, I found about ten or
twelve ears of green barley appeared in the very same
shape and make as that in England
1 can scarce exprefs the agitations of my mind at this
sight. Hitherto, I had looked upon the actions of this life
no otherwise than only as the events of blind chance and
fortune. But now the appearance of this barley, flourishing
in a barren soil, and my ignorance in not conceiving how it
should come there, made me conclude, that miracles were not
yet ceastd.: nay, I even thought that God had appointed it
to grow there without any seed, purely for my sustenance
in this miserable and desolate island. And indeed such
great effect this had upon me, that it often made me melt
into tears, through a grateful sense of God's mercies; and
the greater still was my thankfulnefs, when I perceived
about this little field of barley some rice stalks, also wonder-
fu:ly flourishing.
While thus pleased in mind, I concluded there must be
more corn in the island; and therefore made a diligent
search narrowly among the rocks; but not being able to
find a-iy, on a sudden it came into mind, how I had shaken
the husks of corn out of the bag, and then my admiration
ceased, with my gratitude to the Divine Being, as thinking
it iua.: but natural, and not to be conceived a miracle; though
even the manner of its preservation might have made me
own it was a wonderful event of God's kind Providence.
It was about the latter end of June when the ears of
this corn ripened, which I laid up very carefully together
with 20 or 30 stalks of rice, expecting one day I should reap
the fruit of my labour; yet four years were expired be-
fore I could allow myself to eat any barley bread, and much
longer time before I had any rice. After this, with indefa-
tigable pains and industry, for three or four months, at last I
fimshed my wall on the 14th of April, having no way to go
into it, but by a ladder against the wall.
April n. I finished my ladder, and ascended it; after-
wards pulled it up, then let it down on the other side, and
descended into my new habitation, where I had space
enough, and so fortified that nothing could attack me with-
out scaling the walls.
But what does all human pains and industry avail, if the
blessing of God does not crown our labours? Or who can
stand before the Almighty, when he stretcheth forth his arm?
For one time as I was at the entrance of my cave, there hap-
pened such a dreadful earthquake, that not only the roof of
the cave came tumbling about my ears, but the posts seemed
to crack terribly at the same time. This put me in great
amazement; and running to the ladder, and getting over the
wall, I then plainly knew it was an earthquake; the place I
stood on sustained three terrible shocks in less than three
minutes. But judge of my terror when I saw the top of a
great rock roll into the sea; I then expected the island would
be swallowed up every moment: and what made the scene
still more dreadful, was to see the sea thrown into the most
violent agitations arid disorders by this tremendous accident.
For my part, I stood like a criminal at the place of execu-
tion, ready to expire. At the moving of the earth, I was, .
as it were, sea-sick; and very much afraid lest the rock,
under which was my fence and habitation, should over-
whelm it and myself in a lasting tomb.
When the third dreadful shock had spent itself, my spirits began to revive; yet still I would not venture to ascend
the ladder, but continued sitting, not knowing what I should
do. So little grace had I then, as only to say, Lard have
mercy upon me! and no sooner was the earthquake over, but
that pathetic prayer left me.
It was not long after, when a horrible tempest arose, at the same time attended with a hurricane of wind. The sea
seemed mountains high, and the waves rolled so impetuously,
that nothing could be perceived but froth and foam. Three
hours did this storm continue, and in so violent a manner, as
to tear the very trees up by the roots, which was succeeded by abundance of rain. When the tempest was over, I went
to my tent: but the rain coming on in a furious manner, I was obliged to take shelter in the cave, where I was forced
to cut a channel through my fortification to let the water out.
It continued raining all that night, and some time the next
day. These accidents made me resolve, as soon as the C3
weather cleared up, to build me a little hut in some open
place, walled round to defend me from wild creatures and
savages; not doubting but at the next earthquake, the
mountain would fall upon my habitation and me, and swal-
low up all in its bowels.
April 16—20. These days I spent in contriving how
and in what manner I should fix my place of abode. All
this while I was under the most dreadful apprehensions.—When I looked round my habitation, every thing I found in
its proper place. I had several resolutions whether I should
move or not; but at length resolved to stay where I was, till
I found out a convenient place where I might pitch my tent.
April 22. When I began to put my resolution in prac-
tice, I was stopt for want of tools and instruments to work
with. Most of my axes and hatchets were useless, occa-
sioned by cutting the hard timber that grew on the island.
It took me up a full week to make my grindstone of use to
me, and at last I found out a way to turn it about with my
foot, by help of a wheel and a string.
April 28, 29. These days were spent in grinding my tools.
April 30. My bread falling short, 1 allowed myself but
one biscuit a day.
May 1. As I walked along the sea-shore, I found a barrel
of gunpowder, and several pieces of the wreck, the sea had
flung up. Having secured those, I made to the ship, whose
stern was tore off, and washed a great distance ashore; but
the rest lay in the sands. This I supposed was occasioned
by the earthquake. I now resolved to keep my old place
of abode: and also to go to the ship that day, but then
found it impossible.
May 3. This day I went on board, and with my saw
«awed off' one of the beams, which kept the quarter-deck.
I then cleared the sand till flood.
May 4. I caught some fish, but they were not wholesome.
The same day I also catched a young dolphin.
May 5. This day 1 also fepaired to the wreck, and sawed
another piece of timber, and when the flood came, I made
a float of three great planks, which were driven ashore by
the tide.
May 6, 7, 8, 9. These days I brought off the iron bolts,
opened the deck with the iron crow, and carried two planks
to land, having made a way into the very middle of the
wreck.
May 10, II, 12, 13, 14.. All this time I spent in bringing
off great quantities of iron and timber.
May 15. Took with me two hatchets on purpose to cut
nff some lead from the roll, but all in vain; for it lay too
low under water.
May 16, I omitted going to the wreck this day, for em-
ploying myself to look for pigeons, I outstayed my time.
May 17. I perceived several pieces of the wreck driven
ashore, which I found belonged to the head of the ship. May 24. To this day I worked on the wreck, and with
great difficulty loosened some things so much with the crow,
that at the first flowing tide, several casks floated out, and
many of the seamen's chests; yet that day nothing came to
land but pieces of timber, and a hogshead which had some
Brazil pork in it. I continued working to the lothof June;
(except necessary time for food or rest) and, had I known
how to have built a boat, I had timber and planks enough:
I had also near 100 weight of sheet lead.
June 16. As I was wandering towards the sea-side, I
found a large tortoise or turtle, being the first I had seen on
the island; though, as I afterwards found, there were many
on the other side of it.
June 17. This day I spent in cooking it, found in her
threescore eggs, and her flesh the most savoury and pleasant
I ever tasted in my life.
June 18. I staid within this day, there being a continual
rain: and it was somewhat more chilly and cold than usual.
June 19. Exceedingly bad, being taken with a trembling
and shivering.
June 20. Awake all night, my head racked with pain and
feverish.
June 21. Sick unto death, and terrified with the dismal
apprehensions of my condition. Prayed to God more fre-
quently, but very confusedly.
June 22. Something better, but still uneasy in my mind.
June 23. Again relapsed much as before.
June 24. Mended a second time.
June 25. A violent ague for seven hours, cold and hot
fits succeeded with faint sweats.
June 26. Better, but very weak, yet I scrambled out, shot
a she-goat, brought it home and boiled some of it; I would
willingly have stewed it, and made some broth, but had no
pot.
June 27. All this day I was afflicted with an ague;
thirsty, yet could not help myself to water: Prayed to God
in these words: "Lord, in pity look upon me: Lord have
mercy upon me: have mercy upon me!" After this [
fell asleep, which I found had much refreshed me, when I
awaked. I fell fast asleep a second time, and fell into this
strange and terrible sort of dream.
Methought I was sitting on the same spot of ground at the
outside of the wall where I sat when the storm blew after
the earthquake; and that I saw a man descending from a
great black cloud, and alight upon the ground. He was all
over as bright as a flash of fire that a little before surrounded
him; his countenance inconceivably terrible; the earth, as
it were, trembled when he stept upon the ground, and flashes
of fire seemed to fill all the air. No sooner, I thought, he
landed upon the earth, but with a long spear, or other wea-
pon, he made towards me; but first ascending a rising
ground, his voice added to my amazement, when I thought
I heard him pronounce these dreadful words, "Unhappy
"wretch! seeing all these things have not brought thee to
"repentance, thou shalt immediately die." In pronouncing
this dreadful sentence, I thought he meant to kill me with the spear that was in his hand.
Any body may think it impossible for me to exprefs th£
horrors of my mind at this vision: and even when I awaked,
this very dream made a deep impression upon my mind.—
The little divine knowledge I had, I received from my fa-
ther's instructions, and that was worn out by an uninter-
rupted series of sea. faring impiety for eight years space. Ex-
cept what sickness forced from me, I do not remember-I had
once thought of lifting up my heart towards God, but rather
had a certain stupidity of soul, not having the least sense ot
fear of the Omnipotent Being when in distress, nor of gra-
titude to him for his deliverances. Nay, when I was on the
desperate expedition on the desert African shore,*"! cannot
remember I had one thought of what would become of me,
or to beg his consolation and assistance in my sufferings and
distrefs. When the Portugal captain took me up, and ho-
nourably used me, nay, farther, when I was even delivered
from drowning, by escaping to this island, I never looked
upon it as a judgment, but only said I was an unfortunate
dog, and that's,all. Indeed, some secret transports of soul I
had, which was not through grace, but only a common flight of joy, that I was yet alive, when my companions were all
drowned, and no other joy could I conceive but what is
common with the sailors over a bowl of punch, after they
have escaped the greatest dangers.
The likelihood of wanting for neither food nor conveni-
ences, might have called upon me for a thankful acknow-
ledgment to Providence. Indeed the growth of my corn
touched me with some sense; but that soon wore off again.
The terrible earthquake pointed to me, as it were, the fin-
ger of God, but my dreadful amazement continued no longer
than its duration. Butnow, when my spirits began to sink
under the burden of a strong distemper, and I could leisurely
view the miseries of death present themselves before my
eyes, then my awakened conscience began to reproach me
with my past life, in which I had so wickedly provoked the
justice of God to pour down his vengeance upon me.
Such reflections as these,opprefsed me even in the violence
ofdistempen Some prayers I uttered, which only proceeded
from the fear of death. But when I considered my father's
advice and prophecy, I could not forbear weeping: for he
told me, " That if I did persist in my folly, I should not only
be deprived of God's blefsing, but have time enough to
•' reflect upon my despising his instructions, and this in a
wretched time, when none could help me." And now
concluding it to be fulfilled, having no soul in the island to
administer any comfort to me, I prayed earnestly to the
Lord, that he would help me in this my great calamity.—And this, I think, was the first time I prayed in sincerity for
many years. But now I must return to my journal.
June 28. Something refreshed with sleep, and the fit
quite off, I got up. My dream still occasioned in me a great
consternation; and, fearing that the ague might return the
succeeding day, 1 concluded it time to getsometliing to com-
fort me. I filted a case-bottle with water, and set it within
reach of my bed; and, to make it more nourishing and lels
rhilly, I put some rum in it. The next thing I did was to
broil me a piece of goat's flesh, of which I ate but little; I
was very weak; however, walked about, dreading the return
of my distemper; and at night I supped on three of the
turtle's eggs, which I roasted and ate, begging God's bles-
sing therewith.
After I had eaten, I attempted to walk again out of doors
with my gun; but was so weak, that I sat down, and look-
ed at the sea, which was smooth and calm. While I con-
tinued here, these thoughts came into my mind.
In what manner is the production of the earth and sea, ot
which I have seen so much? From whence came myself,
and all other creatures living, and of what are they made?
Our beings were assuredly created by some almighty in-
visible Power, who framed the earth, the sea, and air, and
all therein. But what is that Power?
Certainly it must follow that God has created it all. Yet,
said I, if God has made all this, he must be the Ruler of
them all, and what is relating thereto; for certainly the
Power that makes, must indisputably have a power to guide
and direct them. And if this be so, (as certainly it must)
nothing can happen without his knowledge and appoint-
ment. Then, surely, if nothing happens without God's ap-
pointment, certainly God has appointed these my sufferings
to befal me. And here I fixed my firm belief that it was
his will that it should be so; and then proceeded to inquire, why should God deal with me in this manner? Or what
have I done thus to deserve his indignation?
Here conscience flew in my face, reprehending me as a
blasphemer; crying with a loud and piercing voice, "Un-
"worthy wretch! how dare you ask what you have done?
Look on your past life, and see what you have left undone?
"Ask thyself, why thou wert not long ago in the mercilels
"hands of death? Why not drowned in Yarmouth roads,
or killed in the fight, when the ship was taken by the
"Salee man of war? Why not entombed in the bowels of
"wild beasts on the African coast, or drowned here when
all thy companions suffered shipwreck in the ocean f
Struck dumb with these reflections, I rose up in a pen-
sive manner, being so thoughtful that I could not go to
sleep; and fearing the dreadlul return of my distemper, it
caused me to remember, that the Brazilians use tobacco for
almost all diseases. I then went to my chest in order to
find some, where Heaven, no doubt, directed me to find a
cure for both soul and body; for there I found one of the
Bibles, which, till this time, I had neither leisure nor incli-
nation to look into. I took both the tobacco and that out of
the chest, and laid them on the table. Several experiments
did I try with the tobacco: First, I took a piece of leaf, and
chewed it; but it being very green and strong, almost
stupified me. Next I steeped it in some cum an hour ot
two, resolving when I went to bed to take a dose of it:
and in the third place, I burnt some over a pan of fire,
holding my nose over it as long as I could endure it with-
out suffocation.
In the intervals of this operation, though my head was
giddy and disturbed by the tobacco, I took up the Bible to
read. No sooner did I open it, but there appeared to me
these words, "Call on me in the day of trouble, and I will
deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify me."
At first, this sentence made a very deep imprefsion on
my heart, but it soon wore off again, when I considered the
word deliver was foreign to me. And as the children of
Israel said, when they were promised flesh to eat, "Can
God spread a table in the wildernefs?" In like manner I
began to say, " Can Godhimself deliver me from this deso-
late island?" However the words would still return to my
mind, and afterwards made a greater imprefsion upon me.
As it was now very late, and the tobacco had dozed my
head, I was inclined to sleep; but before I would lie down
I fell on my knees, and implored the promise that God had
made me in the Holy Scriptures, that " if I called upon him
in the day of trouble, he would deliver me." With much
difficulty, i afterwards drank the rum, wherein I had steeped
the tobacco, which flying into my head, threw me into such
a profound sleep, that it was three o'clock the next day before
I awaked; or rather, I believe, I slept two days, having cer-
tainly lost a day in my account, and I could never tell any
other way. When I got up, my spirits were lively and
cheerful; my stomach much better, being very hungry;
and, in short, no fit returned the next day, which was the
29th, but 1 found myself much altered for the better.
The 30th I went abroad with my gun, but not far, and
killed a sea-fowl or two, resembling a brand goose, which,
however, I cared not to eat when I brought them home,
but dined on two more of the turtle's eggs. In the evening
I renewed my medicine, excepting that I did not take so
large a quantity, neither did I chew the leaf, or hold my
head over the smoke: but the next day, which was the 1st
of July, having a little return of the cold fit, I again took
my medicine as I did the first time.
July 3. The fit quite left me, but very weak. In this
condition, I often thought of these words, "1 will deliver
thee;" and while, at some times, I would think of the im-
pofsibilily of it, other thoughts would reprehend me for dis-
regarding the deliverances I had received, even from the
most foriornand distressed condition. I asked myself, what
regard have I had to God for his abundant mercies? Have
I done my part?" He has delivered me, but I have not
glorified him:"—as if I had said, I had not owned and
been thankful for these as deliverances, and how could I
expect greater? So much did this sensibly touch my heart,
that I gave God thanks for my recovery from sickness in
the most humble prostration.
July 4. This morning I began seriously to ponder on what
is written in the New Testament, resolving to read a chap-
ter every morning and night as long as my thoughts would
engage me. As soon as I set about this work seriously, I
found my heart deeply affected with the impiety of my past
life; these words that I thought were spoken to me in my
dream, revived, " All these things have not "brought thee to
repentance." After this, I begged of God to assist me
with his Holy Spirit in returning to my duty. One day, in
perusing the Scriptures, I came to these words, "Him hath
God exalted to be a Prince and a Saviour, to give repentance
and to give remifsion:" immediately I laid down the
book, and with uplifted hands to Heaven, loudly cried, " O
blefsed Jesus, thou son of David, Jesus, thou exalted Prince
and Saviour, give me repentance!" And now indeed I prayed
with a true sense of my condition, and a more certain hope,
founded on the word of God. Now I had a different sense
of these words, " Call on me and I will deliver thee," that
is, from the dreadful load of guilt which oppressed my sinful
soul, and not from a solitary life, which might rather be
called a blessing, seeing I wanted neither food nor rai-
ment, when compared with living among the human race,
surrounded with so much opprefsion, misery, and affliction:
In a word, I came to this conclusion, that a deliverance
from sin was a much greater blefsing, than a deliverance
friim affliction. But again I proceed to my journal. To the 14ih of July. 1 walked about with my gun, little
and little at a time, having been reduced to the greatest
extremity of weakness. The applications and experiments
I used, were perfectly new: neither could I recommend
them to any one's practice. For, though it carried off the
iit, it very much weakened me, and I had frequent convul-
sions in my.nerves and limbs lor some time. From this, I learned, that going abroad in rainy weather, especially when
it was attended with storms and hurricanes of wind, was
most pernicious to health. I had now been about ten
months in the island; and, as I never had seen any of the
human kind, 1 therefore accounted myself as sole monarch;
and as I grew better, having secured my habitation to my
mind, I resolved to make a tour round my kingdom, in or-
der to make new discoveries.
The 15th of July, I began my journey; I first went to
the creek, where I had brought my rafts on shore; and, tra-
velling farther, found that the tide went no higher than two
miles up, where there was a little brook of running water,
on the bank of which were many pleasant savannahs or
meadows, plain, smooth, and covered with grafs. On the
rising parts, where I supposed the water did not reach, I
perceived a great deal of tobacco growing to a very strong
stalk. Several other plants I likewise found, the virtues of
which I did not understand. I searched along time for the
Cafsava root, which I knew the Indians in that climate
made their bread of, but all in vain. There were several
plants of aloes, though at that time I knew not what they were; likewise I saw several sugar canes, but imperfect for
want of cultivation. With these few discoveries, I came
back that night, and slept contentedly in my little castle.
The next day, being the 16th, going the same way, but
farther than the day before, I found the country more a Jorned
with woods and trees. Here I perceived different fruits in
great abundance. Melons in plenty lay on the ground, and
clusters of grapes, ripe and very rich, spread over the trees. You may imagine I was glad of this discovery, yet ate very sparingly, lest 1 should throw myself into a flux or fever.
The grapes I found of excellent use; for when I had dried
them in the sun, which preserved them as dried raisins are
kept, they proved very wholesome and nourishing, and
served me in these seasons when no grapes were to be had.
The night drawing on apace, I ascended up a tree, and
slept very comfortably, though it was the first time I had
lain out of my habitation. And when the morning came, I
proceeded with great pleasure on my way, travelling about
iour miles, as I imagined, by the length of the valley, di-
iccting my course northward, there being a ridge of hills on
the south and north side of me. At the end of this D
I came to an opening, where the country seemed to descend
to the west; there I found a little spring of fresh water,
proceeding out of the side of the hill, with its crystal streams
running directly east. And, indeed, here my senses were
charmed with the most beautiful landscape nature could af-
ford; for the country appeared flourishing, green, and de-
lightful; that to me it seemed like a planted garden. I then
descended on the side of that delicious vale, when I found
abundance of cocoa, orange, lemon and citron trees, but very wild and barren at that time. As for the limes, they
were delightful and wholesome, the juice of which I after
used to mix in water, which made it very cooling and re-
freshing. And now I was resolved to carry home and lay
up a store of grapes, limes, and lemons, against theapproach-ing wet season. So laying them up in several parcels, and
then taking a few of each with me, I returned to my little
castle, after having spent three days in this journey. Before
] got home, the grapes were so bruised that they were
utterly spoiled; the limes, indeed, were good; but of those
I could bring only a few.
July 19. Having prepared two bags, I returned thither
again, but, to my great surprise, found all the grapes spread
about, trod to pieces, tind abundance eaten, which made me
conclude there were wild beasts thereabouts. To prevent
this happening again, I gathered a large quantity of the
grapes, and hung them upon the out-branches of the tree,
both to keep them unhurt, and that they might cure and dry
in the sun: and having well loaded myself with limes and
itmons, 1 returned once more to my old place of residence.
And now contemplating on the iruitfulnels of this valley,
and pleasantnels of its situation, its security from storms,
and the delightfuinefs of the adjacent woods, I concluded
I was settled in the worst part of the country, and there-
lore was thinking to remove my habitation.
But when I considered again, that, though it was pleasant,
it was off from the sea-side, where there was a possibility, some time or other, a ship might either be driven or sail by;
and, that to inclose myself among hills and woods, must cer-
tainly put an end to my hopes of deliverance; I resolved
to let my castle remain where Providence had first aisigned
it. Vet so ravished was I with this place, that I made me
a little kind of bower, surrounding it with a double hedge,
as high as I could reach. Well staked and filled with bail-
rushes: and having spent a great part of the month of July,
I think it was the first of August before I began to enjoy
my labour.
Aug. 3. Perceiving my grapes to be dry, I took them from
the trees, and they proved excellent good raisins of the sun:
the most of which I carried to my cave; and happy for me
I did so; by which I saved the best part of my winter food.
Aug. 14. This day it began to rain; and though I had
made me a tent like the other, yet having no shelter ot'a hill
to keep me from storms, nor a cave behind me to retreat to,
I was obliged to return to my old castle. The rain con-
tinued more or less every day, till the middle of October;
and sometimes so violent, that I could not stir out of my
cave for several days. This season I found my family to
increase; for one of my cats that ran away from me, and
which I thought had been dead, returned about August,
with three kittens at her heels, like herself, which I thought
strange, because both my cats were females, and the wild
cats of the island seemed to be of a different kind from our
European cats; but from these cats proceeded such num-
bers, that I was forced to kill and destroy them as I would
do wild beasts and vermine.
To the 26ih of this month, I could not stir out, it raining
incefsantly; when beginning to want food, I was compelled
to venture twice; the first of whick 1 shot a goat, and af-
terwards found a very large tortoise. The manner of my regulating my food was thus: a bunch of raisins served ma
for my breakfast, a piece of goat's Mesh, or turtle, boiled, for
my dinner, and two or three turtle's eggs for my supper.
While the rain lasted, I daily worked two or three hours at
enlarging my cave, and by degrees worked it on towards
one side, till I came to the outside of the hill, and made a
door or way out, which came beyond my fence or wall, and
so I came in and out this way. But after I had done this, I
was troubled to see myself thus exposed; though I could
not perceive any thing to fear, a goat being the biggest
creature I had seen upon this island.
Sept. 30. Casting up my notches on my post, which
amounted to 365, I concluded this to be the anniversary of
my landing; and, therefore, humbly prostrating myself on
the ground, confefsing my sins, acknowledging God's
righteous judgments upon me, and praying to Jesus Christ
to have mercy upon me, I fasted for twelve hours till the D2
going down of the sun; and then eating a biscuit and a
bunch of grapes, laid me on the bed, and with great comfort
took my night's repose. Till this time, I never had distin-
guished the Sabbath-day: but now I made a longer notch
than ordinary for the days of rest, and divided the week as
well as I could, though I found I had lost a day or two in
my account. My ink failing soon after, I omitted in my
daily memorandum, things of an indifferent nature, and con-
tented myself to write down only the most remarkable events
of my life. The rainy and dry seasons appeared now regular
to me, and experience taught me how to provide for them;
yet,in one thing I am going to relate, myexperience very
much failed me. You may call to mind what I have men-
tioned of some barley and rice, which I had saved; about
thirty stalks of the former and twenty of the latter: and, at
that time, the sun being in its southern position, going from
me, together with the rains, made me conclude it a very
proper season to sow it. Accordingly I dug up a piece of
ground with my wooden spade, and divided it into two
parts, sowed about two thirds of my seed, preserving by
me about a handful each. And happy it was I did so; for
no rains falling, it was choaked up, and never appeared
above the earth till the wet season came again; and then
part of it grew as if it had been newly sown.
I was resolved still to make another trial; and seeking
for a moister piece of ground near my bower, I there sowed
Ihe rest of my seed in February, a little before the vernal
equinox; which having the rainy months of March and
April to water it, yielded a noble crop, and sprang up very
pleasantly. 1 had still saved part of the seed, not daringto
venture all; and by the time I found out the proper seasons
to sow it in, and that I might expect every year two seed-
-times and two harvests, my stock amounted to above half a
peck of each sort of grain.
No sooner were the rains over, but the stakes which I had
cut from the trees, shot out like willows, the first year after
lopping their heads. I was ignorant of the tree I cut them
from: but they grew so regularly beautiful, that they made
a most lively appearance, and so flourished in three years
time, that I resolved to cut more of them; and these soon
growing, madeaglorious fence, as afterwards I shall observe.
And now I perceived that the seasons of the year might
generally be divided not into summer and winter, as in
Europe, but into wet and dry seasons, as in this manner:

The wet season would continue longer or shorter, as the
winds happened to blow. But having found the ill conse-
quences of being abroad in the rain, I took care beforehand
to furnish myself with provisions; and, during the wet
months, sat within doors as much as possible. At this time I
contrived to make many things that I wanted, though it cost
me much labour and pains, before I could accomplish them.
The first 1 tried was to make a basket, but all the twigs I
could get proved so brittle, that I could not then perform it.
It now proved of great advantage to me, that, when a boy, I
took a great delight at standing at a basket-maker's in the
same town where my father lived, to view them at work;
and like other boys, curious to see the manner of their
working these things, and very officious to assist, I perfectly
learned the method of it, and wanted nothing but the tools.
And it coming into my mind, that the twigs of that tree. of
of which I made my stakes, might be as tough as a sallow-
willow or-osiers, growing in England, I resoved to make an experiment, and went the next day to my country-seat, and found some fit for my turn; and after cutting down a
quantity with my hatchet, I dried them in my pale, and,
when fit to work with, carried them to my cave, where I
employed myself in making several sorts of baskets, inso-
much that I could put in whatsoever I pleased. It is true,
they were not cleverly made, yet they served my turn upon all occasions.
D 3
But still I wanted two necessary things. I had no cask
to hold my liquor, except two runlets almost full of rum, a
few bottles of an ordinary size, and some square case bottles;
neither had I a pot to boil any thing in, only a large kettle
unfit to make broth, or stew a bit of meat: I wanted like-
wise at the beginning of this dry season, a tobacco pipe;
but for this I afterwards found an expedient.
I kept myself employed in planting my second row of
stakes. But remembering that when I travelled up to the
brook, I had a mind to see the whole island, I now resumed
my intention; and taking my dog, gun, hatchet, two biscuit
cakes, a great bunch of raisins, with a larger quantity of
powder and shot than usual, I began my journey. Having
passed the vale where my bower stood, I came within view
of the sea, lying to the west; when it being a clear day, I
riirly descried land, extending from the W. to the S. W.
about ten or fifteen leagues, as I concluded; but could not
say whether it was an island or a continent. Neither
could I tell what this place might be; only thought it was
part of America, and where I might have been in a miser-
able condition, had I landed. Again, I considered, that if
this was the Spanish coast, certainly one time or other, I
should see some ship pass by; and if it was not, then it
must be the savage coast, between the Spanish country and
Brazil, which abounds with cannibals or man-eaters.
As I proceeded forward, I found this side of the island
much more pleasant than mine; Ihe fields fragrant, adorned
with sweet flowers and verdant grass, together with several
very fine woods. There were parrots in plenty, which
made me long for one to be my companion; but it was with
great difficulty I could knock one down with my stick; and
I kept him at home some years before I could get him to
call me by my name.
In the low grounds, I found various sorts of hares and
foxes, as I took them to be, but much different from those in
England. Several of these I killed, but never ate them;
neither, indeed, had I any occasion; for abounding with
goats, pigeons, turtle, and grapes, I could defy Leadenhall
market to furnish me a better table. In this journey, I did
not travel above two miles a day, because I took several
turns and windings, to see what discoveries I could make,
returning weary enough to the place where I designed to
rest all night, which was either in a tree, or in a piace
which I surrounded with stakes, that no wild creature might
suddenly surprise me. When I came to the sea-shore, I was
amazed to see the splendor of it. Its strand was covered
with shells of the most beautiful fish, and constantly abound-
ing with innumerable turtles, and fowls of many kinds,
which I was ignorant of, except those called penguins. I
might have shot as many as I pleased, but was sparing of
my ammunition; rather choosing to kill a she-goat, which I
did with much difficulty, on account of the flatnefs of the
country.
Now though this journey produced me the most pleasing
satisfaction, yet my habitation was so much to my liking,
that I did not repine at my being seated on the worst part
of the island. I continued my journey, travelling about
twelve miles further towards the east, where I set a great
pile on the shore for a mark, concluding that my next jour-
ney should bring me to the other side of the island, east from
my castle, and so round till I came to my post again. As I
had a constant view of the country, I thought I could not
miss my way; but scarce had I travelled three miles, when
I descended into a very large valley, so surrounded with
hills covered with wood, that I having no guide but the sun,
nor even this, unless I knew well the position at the time at
that time of the day: and, to add to my misfortune, the wea-
ther proving very hazy, 1 was obliged to return to my post
by the seaside, and so backwards the same way I came.—
In this journey my dog surprised a kid, and would have
killed it, had I not prevented him. As I had often been
thinking of getting a kid or two, and so raising a breed of
tame goats to supply me after my ammunition was spent, I
took this opportunity of beginmng: and having made a
collar for this little creature, with a string made of rope-
yarn, I brought it to my bower, and there inclosed and left
him; and having spent a month in this journey, at length
I returned to my own habitation.
Nobody can doubt of my satisfaction, when I returned to
my little castle, and reposed myself in my hammock. After
my journey, I rested myself a week, which time I employed
in making a cage for my pretty Poll. I now began to
consider my poor kid I had left in the bower, and I imme-
diately went to fetch it home. When I came there, 1 found
the young creature almost starved; I gave it some food, and
tied it as before: but there was no occasion, for it followed -
me like a dog; and, as I constantly fed it, it became so
loving, gentle, and fond, that it commenced one of my do-
mestics, and would never leave me.
The rainy season of the autumnal equinox being now
come, I kept the"30th of September in the most solemn
manner, as usual; it being the third year of my abode in
the island. I spent the whole day in acknowledging God's
mercies, in giving him thanks for making this solitary life as
agreeable and lefs sinful, that that of human society; and
for the communications of his grace to my soul, in support-
ing, comforting, and encouraging me to depend upon his
Providence, and hope for his eternal presence in the world
to come.
Indeed, I often did consider how much more happy I was
in this state of life, than in that accursed manner of living I
formerly used; and sometimes when hunting, or viewing the country, the anguish of my soul would break out upon
me, and my very heart would sink within me, to think of the
woods, the mountains, the deserts I was in; and how I was
a prisoner locked up within the eternal bars and bolts of the
ocean, in an uninhabited wildernefs, without hopes, and
without redemption. In this condition I would often wring
my hands, and weep like a child: and even sometimes, in
the middle of my work, this fit would take me; and then I
would sit down and sigh, looking on the ground for an hour
or two together, till such time as my grief got vent in a flood
of tears.
One morning as I was sadly employed in this manner, I
opened my Bible, when I immediately fixed my eyes upon
these words, "1 will never leave thee, nor forsake thee!"
Surely, thought I, these words are directed to me,or else why
should they appear just at a moment when I am bemoaning my forlorn condition? and if God does not forsake, what
matters it, since he can make me more"happy in this state of
life, than if I enjoyed the greatest splendour in the world?
But while I was going to return God thanks for my present
state, something seemed to shock my mind, as if it had thus
said: Unworthy wrqtch, can you pretend to be thankful
for a condition from Which you would pray to be delivered!
Here I stopt;—and though I could not say, I thanked the
Divine Majesty for being there, yet I gave God thanks for
placing to my view my former course of life, and granting
me a true knowledge of repentance. And whenever 1 opened
49
wr shut the Bible, I blessed kind Providence, that directed
my good friend in England to send it among my goods with-
out any order, and for assisting me to save it from the power
of the raging ocean.
And now beginning my third year, my several daily em-
ployments were these: First, My duty to Heaven, and di-
ligently reading the Holy Scriptures; which I did twice or thrice every day: Secondly, Seeking provisions with my gun,
which commonly took me up, when it did not rain, three
hours every morning: Thirdly, The ordering, curing, pre-
serving and cooking what I killed, or catched for my sup-
ply, which took me up great part of the day: for, in the
middle of the day, the sun being in its height, it was so hot,
that I could not stir out; so that I had only but four hours
in the evening to work in: and then the want of tools, of
assistance, and skill, wasted a great deal of time to little
purpose. I was no less than two and forty days making a
board fit for a long shelf, which two sawers, with their
tools and saw-pit, would have cut off the same tree in
half a day. It was of a large tree, as my board was to be
broad. I was three days in cutting it down, and two more
in lopping off the boughs, and reducing it to a piece of tim-
ber. This 1 hacked and hewed off each side, till it became
light to move; and then I turned it, made one side of it
smooth and flat as a board from end to end, then turned it
downwards, cutting the other side, till I brought the plank
to be about three inches thick, and smooth on both sides.
Any body may judge my great labour and fatigue in such a
piece of work; but this I went through with patience, as
also many other things that my circumstances made neces-
sary for me to do.
The harvest months, November and December, were
now at hand, in which I had the pleasing prospect of a very
good crop. But here I met with a new misfortune; for
the goats and hares, having tasted of the sweetness of the
blade, kept it so short, that it had not strength to shoot up
into a stalk. To prevent this, I inclosed it with a hedge,
and by day shot some of its devourers; and my dog which I
had tied to the field-gate, keeping barking all night, so
frightened those creatures, that I got entirely rid of them.
But no sooner did I get rid of these, than other enemies
appeared, to wit, whole flocks of several sorts of birds who
only waited till my back was turned, to ruin me. So much did this provoke me, that I let fly, and killed three of the
malefactors; and afterwards served them as they do notori-
ous thieves in England, hung them up in chains, as a terror
to others. And, indeed, so good an effect had this, that they
not only forsook the corn, but all that part of the island, so
long as these criminals hung there.
My corn having ripened apace, the latter end of Decem-
ber, which was my second harvest, I reaped it with a scythe,
made of one of my broad swords. I had no fatigue in cut-
ting down my first crop, it was so slender. The ears I car-
ried home in a basket, rubbing it with my hands, instead of
thrashing it; and when the harvest was over, found nay
half peck of seed produced near two bushels of rice and
two bushels and a half of barley. And now I plainly fore-
saw, that, by God's goodnefs, I should be furnished with
bread; but yet I was concerned, because I knew not how
to grind or make meal of my corn, or bread, neither knew
how to bake it. I would not, however, taste any of the
crop, but resolved to preserve it against next season, and,
in the mean while, use my best endeavours to provide my-
self with other food.
But where were my labours to end? The want of a
plough to turn up the earth, or shovel to dig it, I conquered
by making me a wooden spade. The want of a harrow I
supplied myself with dragging over the corn a great bough
of a tree. When it was growing, I was forced to fence it;
when ripe to mow it, carry it home, thrash it, part it from
the chaffand save it. And, after all, I wanted a mill to grind
it, sieve to dress it, yeast and salt to make it into bread, and
an oven to bake it. This set my brains to work to find
some expedient for every one of these necessaries against
the next harvest.
And now having more seed, my first care was to prepare
me more land, i pitched upon two large flat pieces of
ground near my castle, for that purpose, in which I sowed
my seed, and fenced it with a good hedge. This took me
up three months: by which time the wet season coining on,
and the rain keeping me within doors, I found several oc-
casions to employ myself; and, while at work, used to di-
vert myself in talking to my parrot, learning him to know
and speak his own name Poll, the first welcome word I ever
heard spoke in the island. I had been a long time con-
triving how to make earthen vessels, which I wanted ex-
fremely and when I considered the beat of the climate, 1 did
not doubt but if 1 could find any such clay, I might botch up a pot, strong enough, when dried in the sun, to bear
handling, and to hold any thing that was dry, as corn, meal,
and other things.
To be short the clay I found; but it would occasion the
most serious person to smile, to see what awkward ways I
took, and what ugly mishapen things I made; how many
either fell out or cracked by the violent heat of the sun, and
fell in pieces when they were removed: so that I think it
was two months before 1'could perfect anything: and
even then but two clumsy things in imitation of earthen jars,
These, however, I very gently placed in wicker baskets,
made on purpose for them, and between the pot and the
baskets, stuffed it full of rice and barley-straw, and these I
presumed would hold my dried corn, and perhaps the meal
when the corn was bruised. As for the smaller things, I
made them with better success; such as little round pots,
flat dishes, pitchers, and pipkins, the sun baking them very
hard.
Yet still I wanted one thing absolutely necefsary, and that
was an earthen pot, not only to hold my liquid, but also to
bear the fire, which none of these could do 1t once hap-
pened, that as I was putting out my fire, I found therein a
broken piece of one of my vessels burnt as hard as rock, and
red as a tile. This made me think of burning some pots;
and having no notion of a kiln, or of glazing them with lead,
1 fixed three large pipkins, and two or three pots in a pile
one upon another. The fire i piled round the outside, and
dry wood on the top, till I saw the pots in the inside red
hot, and found that they were not cracked at all: and when
I perceived them perfectly red, I let one of them stand in
the fire about five or six hours, till the clay melted by the ex-
tremity of the heat, and would have run to glals hud 1 suf-
fered it: upon which I slackened my fire by degrees, till the
rednefs abated; and watching them till the morning, I found
I had three very good pipkins, and two earthen pots, as
well burnt and fit tor my turn as I could desire.
No joy could be greater than mine at this discovery. For
after this, I may say,I wanted for no sort of earthen ware.
1 filled one of my pipkins with water to boil me some meat,
which it did admirably well, and with a piece of kid, I made
me some good broth, as well as my circumstances would
afford me at that time.
The next concern I had, was to get me a stone mortar to
beat some corn in, instead of a mill to grind it. Here, in-
deed, I was at a great loss, as not being fit fora stonecutter; and many days I spent to find out a great stone big enough
to cut hollow and make fit for a mortar, and strong enough
to bear the weight of a pestle, and that would break the corn
without filling it with sand. But all the stones of the island
being of a mouldering nature, rendered my search fruitless; and then I resolved to look out for a great block of hard
wood, which having found, I formed it with my axe and
hammer, and then, with infinite labour, made a hollow in it,
just as the Indians of Brazil make their canoes. When I
had finished this, I made a great pestle of iron wood, and
then laid them up against my succeeding harvest.
My next business was to make a sieve to sift my meal,
and part it from the bran and husk. Having no fine thin
canvafs to search the meal through, I could not tell what to
do. What linen I had was reduced to rags: I had goat's
hair enough, but neither tools to work.it, nor did I know
how to spin it: at length I remembered I had some neck-
cloths of calico or muslin of the sailors, which I had brought
out of the ship, and with these I made three small sieves
proper enough for the work.
I come now to consider the baking part. The want of
an oven I supplied by making some earthen pans very broad
but not deep. When 1 had a mind to bake, I made a great
fire upon the hearth, the tiles of which I had made myself;
and when the wood was burnt into live coals, i spread them
over it, till it became very hot; then sweeping them away,
I set down my loaves, and whelming down the earthen pots
upon them, drew the ashes and coals all around the outsides
of the pot to continue the heat; and in this manner I baked
my barley loaves, as well as if I had been a complete pastry-
-cook, and also made of the rice several cakes and puddings.
It is no wonder that these things took me up the best
part of a year, since what intermediate time I had was be-
stowed in managing my new harvest and husbandry; for in
the proper season I reaped my corn, carried it home, and
laid it up in the ear in my large baskets, tilt 1 had time to
rub, instead of thrashing it. And now, indeed, my corn
increased so much, that it produced me twenty bushels of
barley, and as much rice, that I not only began to use it
freely, but was thinking how to enlarge my barns, and re-
solved to sow as much at a time as would be sufficient for
me for a whole year.
All this while, the prospect of land, which I had seen
from the other side of the island, ran in my mind. I still
meditated a deliverance from this place, though the fear:
of greater misfortunes might have deterred me from it. For,
allowing that I had attained that place, I ran the hazard of being killed and eaten by the devouring cannibals; and if they were not so, yet I might be slain, as other Europeans
had been, who felt into their hands. ^Notwithstanding ail
this, my thoughts ran continually upon that shore. I now wished for my boy Xury, and the long-boat, with the shoul-
der of mutton sail: 1 went to the ship's boat that had been cast a great way on the shore in the late storm. She was
removed but a little; but her bottom being turned up by the impetuosity and fury of the waves and wind, I fell to
work with all the strength I had, with levers and rollers I
had cut from the wood, to turn her, and repair the damages
she had sustained. This work took me up three or four
weeks, when finding my little strength all in vain, I fell to
undermining it by digging away the sand, and so to make it fall down, setting pieces of wood to thrust and guide it
in the fall. But after this was done, I was still unable to
stir it up, or to get under it, much less to move it forward
towards the water, and so I was forced to give it over.
This disappointment, however, did not frighten me. I began to think whether it was not possible for m.e.to make a canoe or perigua, such as the Indians make of the trunk of a tree. But here I lay under particular inconveniences;want of tools to make it, and want of hands to moveit in the water when it was made. However, to work I went.
jipon it, stopping all the inquiries I could make, with this
,very simple answer I made to myself, Let's first make it,
J'll wa-rrant I'll find some way or other to get it along when
.it is done.
1 first cut down •a cedar-tree, which was five feet ten
inches diameter at the lower part next the stump, and four
1'eet eleven inches diameter at the end of twenty-two feet,
after which it lessened for a space, and then parted into
branches. Twenty days was I a hackingand hewing this
tree at the bottom, fourteen more in cutting offthe branches
and limbs, and a whole'month in shaping it like the bottom
of a boat. As for the inside, I was three weeks with a E
mallet and chisel, clearing it in such a manner, as that it was big enough to carry twenty-six men, much bigger than any canoe I ever saw in my life, and consequently sufficient
to transport me and all my effects to that wished-for shore
I so ardently desired.
Nothing remained now, but, indeed, the greatest diffi-
culty to get it into the water, it lying about one hundred
yards from it. To remedy the first inconvenience, which
was a rising hill between the boat and the creek, with won-
derful pains and labour 1 dug into the bowels of the earth,
and made a declivity. But when this was done, all the
strength I had was as insufficient to remove it, as it was when
I attempted to remove the boat. I then proceeded tomeasure
the distance of ground, resolving to make a canal in order
to bring the water to the canoe, since I could not bring the
canoe to the water. But as this seemed to be impracticable
to myself alone, under the space of eleven or twelve years,
it brought me into some sort of consideration; so that I
concluded this also to be impofsible, and the attempt alto-
gether vain. I now saw, and not before, what stupidity it
is to begin work before we reckon its cost, or judge rightly
our own abilities to go through with its performance.
In the height of this work my fourth year "expired, from
the time I was cast on this island. At this time I did not
forget my anniversary; but kept it with rather greater dt£.
voiion than before. For now my hopes being frustrated, I
looked upon this world as a thing I had nothing to do with;
and very well might I say, as father Abraham said unto Dives,
"Between thee and me there is a gulf fixed." And in-
deed I was separated from its wickedness too, having nei-
ther the lust of the flesh, the lustof the eye, nor the pride
of life; I had nothing to covet, being lord, king, and em-
peror over the whole country I had in poftefsion, without
dispute and without control: I had loading of corn, plenty
of turtles, timber in abundance, and grapes above measure.
What was all the rest tome? The money I had lay by me
as despicable dross, which I would freely have given for a
gross of tobacco pipes, or a hand mill to grind my corn: in
a word, the nature and experience of these things dictated
f o me this just reflection: That the good things of this world
are no farther good to us, than they are for our use ; -and
t.hat whatever we may heap up to give to others, we can
but enjoy as much as we use and no more.
These thoughts rendered my mind more easy than usual.
Every time 1 sat down to meat, I did it with thankfulnefs,
admiring the providential hand of God, who, in thiswilder-
nefs, had spread a table to me. And now I considered what
I enjoyed, rather than what I wanted; compared my present
condition with what I at first expected it should be; how
1 should have done, if I had got nothing out of the ship;
that I must have perished before I had caught fish or turtles;
or lived, had I found them, like a mere savage, by eating
them raw, and pulling them to pieces with my claws, like a
beast. I next compared my station to that which I deserv-
ed; howundutiful I had been to my parents: how destitute
of the fear of God: how void of every thing that was good;
and how ungrateful for those abundant mercies I had re-
ceived from Heaven, being fed, as it were, by a miracle,
even as great as Elijah's being fed by ravens; and cast on
a place where there is no venomous creatures to poison or
devour me; in short, making God's tender mercies matter
of great consolation, I relinquished all sadness, and gave
way to contentment.
As long as my ink continued, which with water I made
last as long as I could, I used to minute down the days of the
month, on which any remarkable event happened.—And,
First, I observed, that the same day I forsook my parents
and friends, and ran away to Hull, in order to go to sea; the
same day afterwards in the next year, I was taken and made
a slave by the Salpe rovers.
That the very day I escaped out of the wreck of the ship
in Yarmouth roads, a year after, on the same day, I made
my escape from Salee in my patron's fishing.boat.
And, on the .30th of September, being the day in the year
I was born on, on that day twenty-six years after, was I
miraculously saved, and cast ashore on this island.
The next thing that wasted after my ink, was the bis-
cuit which I had brought out of the ship; and though I al-
lowed myself but one cake a day for above a twelvemonth,
yet I was quite out of bread for near a year, before I got
any corn of my own.
In the next place, my clothes began to decay, and my
linen had been gone long before. However, 1. had pre-
served about three dozen of the sailors' chequered shirts,
which proved a great refreshment to me, when the violent
beams of the sun would not suffer me to bear any of the seaE2
men's heavy watch-coats; which made me turn tailor, and
after a miserable botching manner, convert them to jackets.
To preserve my head, I made me a cap of goat's skin, with
the hair outwards to keep out the rain; which indeed served
me so wel!,that afterwards I made me a waistcoat and opened-
kneed breeches of the same: and then I contrived a
sort of an umbrella,. covering it with skins, which not only
kept out the heat of the sun, but rain also. Thus being easy
and settled in my mind, my chief happiness was to converse
with God, in most heavenly and comfortable ejaculations.
For five years after this I cannot say any extraordinary
thing occurred to me. My chief employment was to cure
my raisins, and plant my barley and rice, both of which I
hud a year's provision beforehand. But though I was dis-
appointed in my first canoe, I made it, at intermediate times, my business to make a second, of much inferior size ; and it
was two years before I had finished it. But as I perceived it would no wise answer my design of sailing to the other
'shore, my thoughts were confined to take a tour round the
island, to see what further discoveries I could make. To
this intent, after having moved her to the water, and tried
how she would sail, I fitted up a little mast to my boat, and
made a sail of the ship's sail that lay by me. I then made
lockers or boxes, at the end of it, to put in necessaries, pro-
vision, and ammunition, which would preserve them drv,
either from rain or the spray of the sea; and in the inside
of the boat, I cut me a long hollow place to lay my gun in,
and to keep it dry, made a flag to hang over it. My um-
breila I fixed in a step in the stern, like a mast, to keep the
heat of the sun off me. And now resolving to see the cir-
cumference of my little kingdom, I victualled my ship for
the voyage, putting in two dozen of my barley-bread loaves,
an earthen pot full of parched rice, a little bottle of rum,
half a goat, powder and shot, and two watch-coats. It was
the 6th of November, in the 6th year of my reign, or capti-
vity, that 1 set out in this voyage; which was much longer
than I expected, being obliged to put farther out, by reason
of the rocks that lay a great way in the sea. And indeed
so much did these rocks surprise me, that I was for putting
back, fearing that if I ventured farther it would be out of
my power to return. In this uncertainty I came to an an-
chor just offshore, to which I waded with my gun on my
shoulder, and then climbing up a hill, which overlooked that point, I saw the full extent of it, ajid so resolved to run
all hazards.
In this prospect from the hill, I perceived a violent cur-
rent running to the east, coming very close to the point;
which I the more carefully observed, thinking it dangerous,
and that when I came to it, I might be drove into the sea
by its force, and not able to return to the island; and cer-
tainly it must have been so, had I not made this observation;
for on the other side was the like current, with this differ-
ence, that it set off at a greater distance; and I perceived
there was a strong eddy under the land; so that my chief
business was to work out of the first current, and conveni-
ently get into the eddy. Two days I staid here, the wind
blowing very briskly E. S. E. which being contrary to the
current, leaves a great breach of the sea upon the point;
so it was neither lit for me to keep too near the shore, on
account of the breach; nor stand at too great a distance, for
fear of the streams. That night the wind abating, it grew
so calm that I ventured out; and here I may be a monu-
ment to all rash and ignorant pilots; for I was no sooner
come to the point, and not above the boat's length from
shore, but I was got into deep water, with a current like
a mill, which drove my boat along so violently, that it was
impossible for me to keep near the edge of it, but forced
me more and more out from the eddy to the left of me; and
all I could do with my paddles were useless, there being no
wind to help me.
Now I began to look upon myself as quite lost, since as
the current ran on both sides of the island, I was very certain they must join again, and then I had no hopes but of
perishing for want in the sea, after what provisions I had
was spent, or before, if a storm should happen to arise.
Who can conceive the present anguish of my mind at
this calamity? With longing eyes did I look upon my little
kingdom, and thought the island the ple.asantest place in
the universe. Happy, thrice happy desert, said I, shall I
never see thee more? Wretched creature! whither atn I
going? Why did I murmur at my lonesome condition, when
now I would give the whole world to bif thither again?
While I was thus complaining, I found myself to be driven
about two leagues into the sea; however, I laboured till my strength was far spent, to keep my boat as far north as
pofsib|y 1 could, to that side of the current where the eddy E 3***
lay on. About noon I perceived a little breeze of wind
spring up from the S. S. E. which overjoyed my heart; and
was still more elated, when in about half an hour, it blew a
fentle fine gale. Had any thick weather sprung up, I had
been lost another way; for having no compafs on board, I
should never have found the way to steer towards the island,
if once it had disappeared; but it proving the contrary, I
set up my mast again, spread my sail, and stood away northward as much as I could, to get rid of the current. And
no sooner did the boat begin to stretch away, but I perceir-
ed, by the clearness of the water, a change of the current
was near; for, where it was strong, the water was foul;
and where it was clear, the current abated. To the east, 1
soon saw about half a mile, a breach of the sea upon some
rocks, which caused it again to separate; and as the main force of it drove away more southerly, leaving the
rocks to the'north-east ; so the other came back by the re-
pulse of the rocks, making a sharp eddy, which returned
back again to the north-west with a very swift stream.
They who have experienced what it is to be reprieved
upon the ladder, or to be saved from thieves, just going to
take away their lives, or such as have been in the like cala-
mities with my own, may guefs my present excefs of joy;
how heartily I ran my boat into the stream of this eddy, and
how joyfulfy 1 spread my sail to the refreshing wind, stand-
ing cheerfully before it, with a smart tide under foot. By
the afsistance of this eddy, I was carried above a league home again, when being in the wake of the island, btJtwixt
the two currents, I found the water to be in a sort of a stand.
About four o'clock in the afternoon, I reached within a
league of the island, and perceived the points of the rock,
which caused this disaster, stretching out, as I observed be-
fore, to the southward, which throwing off the current more
southwardly, had occasioned another eddy to the north. But
having a fair brisk gale, I st retched acrofs this eddy, and in
an hour came within a mile of the shore, where 1 soon
landed to my unspeakable comfort; and after an humble
prostration, thanking God for my deliverance, with a res*'.
lution to lay all thoughts of escaping aside, I brought my
boat safe to a little cove, and laid me down to take a wel-
come repose. When I awoke, I was considering how I
might get my boat home; and coasting along the shore, I
came to^a good bay which ran up to a rivulet or brook,
* . ?*@&&"
where finding a safe harbour, 1 stowed her as safe as if she
had been in a dry dock made on purpose for her.
I now perceived myself not far from the place where be-
fore I had travelled on foot; so taking nothing with me,
except my gun, and umbrella, I began my journey, and in
the evening came to my bower, where I again laid me down
to rest. I had not slept long before I was awakened in
great surprise, by a strange voice that called me several
times, "Robin, Robin, Robinson Crusoe, poor Robin!
"Where are you Robinson Crusoe? Where are you?
"Where have you been f"
So fast was I asleep at first, thai I did not awake thorough-
ly; but half asleep and half awake, I thought I dreamed
that somebody spoke to me. But, as the voice repeated
Robinson. Crusoe several times, being terribly affrighted, I
started up in the utmost confusion; and, no sooner were
my eyes fully open, but I beheld my pretty Poll sitting on
the top of the hedge, and soon knew that it was he that cal-
led me; for just in such bewailing language I used to talk
and teach him; which he so exactly learned, that he would
sit upon my finger, and lay his bill close to my face, and
cry, "Poor Robinson Crusoe, where are you? where have
you been? how came you here r" and such like prattle I
had constantly taught him. But even though I knew it to
be the parrot, it was a great while before I could adjust my-
self; being amazed how the creature got thither, and that
he should fix about that place, and nowhere else. But
now being assured it could be no other than my honest
Poll, my wonder ceased, and reaching out my hand, and
calling familiarly Poll, the creature came to me, and perch-
ed upon my thumb as he was wont, constantly prating to
me with "Poor Robinson Crusoe, and how did I come here,
and where had I been?" as if the bird was overjoyed to
see me; and so I took him home along with me.
I was now pretty well cured of my rambling to sea; yet
I could wish iny boal, which had cost me so much trouble
and pains, on this side the island once more, but which in-
deed was impracticable. I therefore began to lead a very
retired life, 1iving near a twelvemonth in a very contented
manner, wanting for nothing except conversation. As to
mechanic labours, which my necessities obliged me to, I
fancied I could, upon occasion, make a tolerable carpenter,
were the poor tools I had to work withal but good. Be-
sides, as I improved in my earthen ware, 1 contrived to make them with a wheel, which I found much easier and
better, making my work shapely, which before was rude
and ugly. But, I think, I was never so elated with my
own performance or project, than for being able to make a
tobacco-pipe, which, though it proved an awkward clumsy
thing, yet it was very sound, and carried the smoke per-
fectly well, to my great satisfaction.
I also improved my wicker ware, making me abundance of
necessary baskets, which, though not very handsorrie, were
very handy and convenient to fetch things home in, as also
for holding my stores, barley, rice, and other provisions. -
My powder beginning to fail, made me examine after
what manner I should kill the 'goats or birds to live on after
it was all gone. Upon which I contrived many ways to
ensnare the goats, and see if I could catch them alive, parti-
cularly a she-goat with young. At last I had my desire;
for, making pitfalls and traps baited with barley and rice, I
found one morning, in one of them, an old he-goat, and in
the other, three kids, one male, the other two females.
So boisterous was the old one, that I could not bring him
away. But I forgot the old proverb, "That hunger will
"tame a lion:" For had I kept him three or four days with-
out provisions, and then given him some water, with a little
corn, he would have been as tame as a young kid. The
other creatures I bound with strings together; but I had
great difficulty before I could bring them to my habitation.
It was some time before they would feed; but throwing them sweet corn, it so much tempted them, that they began
to be tamer. From thence I concluded, that if I designed
to furnish myself with goat's flesh, when my ammunition was spent, the tamely breeding them up, like a flock of
sheep, about my settlement, was the only method I could
take. I concluded, also, I must separate the wild from the
tame, or else they would always run wild as they grew up;
and the best way for this, was to have some inclosed piece
of ground well tenced, either with a hedge or pale, to keep
them so effectually, that those within might not break out,
or those without break in. Such an undertaking was very
great for one pair of hands; but as there was an absolute
necefsity for doing it, my first care was to find a convenient
piece of ground where there was likely to be herbage for
them to eat, water to drink, and cover to keep them from
the sun.
Here again I gave another instance of my ignorance and
inexperience, pitching upon a piece of meadow land so large,
that had I inclosed it, the hedge or pale had been at least
two miles about. Indeed, had it been ten miles, I had
time enough to do it in; but then I did not consider that my
goats would be as wild in so much compafs, as if they had
had the whole island, and consequently as difficult for me
to catch them. This thought came into my head, after I
had carried it on, I believe, about fifty yards; I therefore
altered my scheme, and resolved to inclose a piece of ground
about one hundred and fifty yards in length, and one hun-
dred in breadth, sufficient enough for as many as would main-
tain me, till such time as my flock increased, and then I could
add more ground. I now vigorously prosecuted my work,
and it took me about three months in hedging the first piece,
in which time I tethered the three kids in the best part of
it, feeding them as near me as possible, to make them fami-
liar: and indeed I very often would carry some ears of bar-
ley or a handful of rice, and feed them out of my hand; by
which they grew so tame, that when my inclosure was
finished, and I had let them loose, they would run after me
for a handful of corn. This indeed answered my end; and
in a year and a half's time, I had a flock of about twelve
goats, kids and all; and in two years after, they amounted
to forty-three, besides what I had taken and killed for my
sustenance. After which I inclosed five several pieces of
ground to feed them in, with pens to drive them into, thai
-1 might take them as I had occasion.
In this project I likewise found additional blessings; for
I not only had plenty of goat's flesh, but milk too, which in
my beginning I did not so much as think of. And, indeed,
though I had never milked a cow, much lefs a goat, or seen
butter or cheese made, yet, after some efsays and miscar-
riages, I made me both, and never afterwards wanted.
How mercifully can the omnipotent Power comfort his
creatures, even in the midst of their greatest calamities?
.How can he sweeten the bitterest Providences, and give us
reason to magnify him in dungeons and prisons! what a
bounteous table was here spread in a wilderness for me,
where I expected nothing at first but to perish for hunger!
Certainly a Stoic would have smiled to see me at dinner.
There sat my royal majesty, an absolute prince and ruler
of my kingdom, attended by my dutiful subjects, whom, if I pleased, I could either hang, draw, quarter, give them
liberty, or take it away. When I dined, I seemed a king,
eating alone, none daring to presume to do so till I had-
done. Poll, as if he had been my principal court favourite,
was the only person permitted to talk with me. My old,
but faithful dog, now grown exceedingly crazy, and who
had no species to multiply his kind upon, continually sat on
my right hand; while my two cats sat on each side of th?
table, expecting a bit from my hand, as a principal mark of
my royal favour. These were not the cats I had brought
from the ship, they had been dead long before, and interred
near my habitation by my own hand. But one of them, as
I suppose, generating with a wild cat, a couple of their
young I had made tame; the rest run wild into the woods,
and in time grew so impudent as to return and plunder me
of my stores, till such time as I shot a great many, and the rest left me without troubling me arty mora. In this plen-
tiful manner did I live, wanting for nothing but conversa-
tion. One thing indeed concerned me, the want of my
boat; I knew not which way to get her round the island.
One time I resolved to go along the shore by land to her;
but had any one in England met such a figure, it would
either have affrighted them, or made them burst into
laughter; nay, I could not but smile to myself at my habit,
which I think in this place will be very proper to describe.
The cap I wore on my head, was great, high, and shape-
lefs, made of a goat's skin, with a flap or penthouse hang-
ing down behind, not only to keep the sun from me, but to
shoot the rain oft' from running into my neck, nothing being more pernicious than the rain falling upon the flesh in these
climates. I had a short jacket pf goat's. skin, whose hair
hung down such a length on each side, that it reached down
to the calves of my legs. As for shoes and stockings, I had
none, but made a semblance of something, I know not what
to call them; they were made like buskins, and laced on
the sides like spatterdashes, barbarously shaped like the rest
of my habit. I had a broad belt of goat's skin dried, girt
found me with a couple of thongs, instead of buckles; on
each pf wl}icn, to supply tjie deficjency of sword and dag-
ger, hung my hatchet and saw. I had another belt, not so
broad, yet fastened in the same manner, which hungover
my shoulder, and at the end of it, under my left arm, hung
two pouches, ffade $f gpaf? skjij to hold my powder M<*
shot. My basket 1 carried on my back, and my gun on my
shoulder; and over my head a great clumsy ugly goat's
skin umbrella, which, however, next to my gun, Was thfe
most necefsary thing about me. As for my face, the colour
was nol so swarthy as the Mulattoes, as might have been
expected from one who took so little care of it, in a climate
within nine or ten degrees of the equinox. At one time
my beard grew so 1ong that it hung down about a quarter
of a yard; but as I had both razors and scifsors in store, I
cut it all off, and suffered none to grow, except a large pair
of Mahometan whiskers, the like of which I had seen wore
by some Turks at Salee, not long enough indeed to hang a
hat upon, but of such a monstrous size, as would have
amazed any in England to have seen.
But all this was of no consequence here, there being none
to observe my behaviour or habit. And so, without fear
and without control, I proceeded on my journey, the prose-
cution of which took me up five Or six days. I first travelled
along the sea shore, directly to the place where I first brought
my boat to an anchor, to get upon the rocks; but now hav-
ing no boat to take care of, I went overland a nearer way
to the same height that I was before upon; when looking
forward to the point of the rock, which lay out, and which
I was forced to double with my boat, I was amazed to see
the sea so.smooth and quiet, there being no rippling motion,
nor current, any more than in other places. This made me
ponder some time to guess the reason of it, when at last I
was convinced that the ebb setting from the west and joining
with the current of water from some great river on shore,
must be the occasion of these rapid streams; and that, con-
sequently, as the winds blew more westwardly or more
southwardly, so the current came the nearer, or went the
farther from the shore. To satisfy my curiosity, 1 waited
there till evening, when the time of ebb being made, I
plainly perceived from the rock the current again as before,
with this difference, that it ran farther off, near half a league
from the shore; whereas, in my expedition, it set close up-
on it, furiously hurrying me and my canoe along with it,
which at another time it would not have done. And now
I was convinced, that, by observing the ebbing and flowing
of the tide, I might easily bring my boat round the island
again. But when I began to think of putting it in practice,
the remembrance of the late danger struck me with such 6
horror, that I changed my resolution, and formed another,
which was more sate, though more laborious; and this was
to make another canoe, and so have one for one side of the
island, and one for the other.
1 had now two plantations in the island; the first my
little fortification, fort, or castle, with many large and spa-
cious improvements; for by this time I had enlarged the cave
behind me with several little caves, one within another,
to hold my baskets, corn, and straw. The piles with which
I made my wall, were grown so lofty and great, as obscured
my habitation. And near this commodious and pleasant
settlement, lay my well-cultivated and improved corn-fields
which kindly yielded me their fruit in the proper season.
My second plantation was that near my country-seat, or
little bower, where my grapes flourished, and where, having
planted many stakes, I made inclosures for my goats, so
strongly fortified by labour and time, that it was much stronger
than a wall, and consequently impossible for them to break
through. As for my bower itself, I kept it constantly in
repair, and cut the trees in such a manner, as made them
grow thick and wild, and form a most delightful shade. In
the centre of this stood my tent, thus erected: I had driven
four piles in the ground, spreading over it a piece of the
ship's sail; beneath which I made a sort of a couch with the
skins of the creatures I had slain, and other things; and
having laid thereon one of the sailor's blankets, which I had
saved from the wreck of the ship, and covering myself with a
great watch-coat, I took up this place for my country retreat.
Very frequently from this settlement did I use to visit
my boat, and keep her in very good order. And sometimes
I would venture in her a cast or two from the shore, but
no farther, lest either a strong current, a sudden stormy
wind, or some unlucky accident should hurry me from the
island as before. But now I entreat your attention, whilst
I proceed to inform you of a new, but most surprising
scene of life which here befel me.
YOU may easily suppose, that after having been here so
^ong, nothing could be more amazing than to see a human
creature. One day it happened, that, going to my boat, I saw the print of a man's naked foot on the shore, very evi-
dt.nt on the sand, as the toes, heel, and every part of it.—Had I seen an apparition of the most frightful shape, I could
not have been more confounded. My willing ears gave the strictest attention. I cast my eyes around, but could
satisfy neither the one nor the other. I proceeded alter-
nately to every part of the shore, but with equal effect;
neither could I see any other mark, though the sand about
it was as susceptible to take impression, as that which was
so plainly stamped. Thus, struck with confusion and hor-
ror, I returned to my habitation, frightened at every bush
'and tree, taking every thing for men; and possessed with
the wildest ideas: that night my eyes never closed. I
formed nothing but the most dismal imaginations, concluding
it must be the mark of the devil's foot which I had seen.
For otherwise how could any mortal come to this island?
where was the ship that transported them r and what signs
of any other footsteps? Though these seemed very strong
reasons for such a supposition, yet (thought I) why should
the devil make the print of his foot to no purpose, as I can
see, when he might have taken other ways to have terrified
me? why should he leave his mark on the other side of the
island, and that too on the sand, where the surging waves
of the ocean might soon have erased the impression. Surely
this action is not consistent with the subtilty of Satan, said
I to myself; but rather must be some dangerous creature,
some wild savage of the main land over against me, that,
venturing too far in the ocean, has been driven here, either
by the violent currents or contrary winds; and not caring to
stay on this desolate island, has gone back to sea again.
Happy, indeed, said I to myself, that none of the savages
had seen me in that place: yet I was not altogether with-
out fear, lest, having found my boat, they should return in
numbers and devour me, or at least carry away all my corn
and destroy my flock ot tame goats. In a word, all my reli-
gious hopes vanished, as though I thought God would not
now protect me by his power, who had so wonderfully pre-
served me so long.
What various chains of Providence are there in the life
of man! How changeable are our affections, according to
different circumstances? We love to day, what we hate
to-morrow; we shun one hour what we seek the next.
This was evident in me in the most conspicuous manner:
for I, who before had so much lamented my condition, in being banished from alljmman kind, was now even ready
to expire, when 1 considered that a man had set his foot on F
this desolate island. But when I considered my station of
life decreed by the infinitely wise and good providence of
God, that I ought not to dispute my Creator's sovereignty,
who has an undoubted right to govern and dispose of his
creatures as he thinks convenient; and that his justice and
mercy could either punish or deliver me: I say, when I
considered all this, I comfortably found it my duty to trust
sincerely in him, pray ardently to him, and humbly resign
myself to his divine will.
One morning lying on my bed, these words of the sacred
writings came into my mind, "Call upon me in the day of
trouble, and I will deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify me."
Upon this sentence, rising more cheerfully from my bed, 1
offered up my prayers in the most heavenly manner: and
when I had done, taking up my bible to read, these words
appeared first in my sight:—" Wait on the Lord, and be
of good cheer, and he shall strengthen thy heart: Wait
I say on the Lord." Such divine comfort did this give me,
as to remove all cause of sadness upon that occasion.
Thus, after a world of apprehensions and fears, for three
days and nights, I at last ventured out of my castle, and
milked my goats, one of which was almost spoiled for want
of it. I next (though in great fear) visited my bower, and
milked my flocks there also; when, growing bolder, I went
down to the shore again, and measuring the print of the foot
to mine, to see, perhaps, whether I myself had not occasion-
ed that mark, I found it much superior in largeness: and so
returned home, now absolutely.convinced that either some
men had been ashore, or that the island must be inhabited,
and therefore that I might be surprised before I was aware.
I now began to think of providing for my security, and
resolved in my mind many different schemes for that pur-
pose. I first proposed to cut down my inclosures, and turn
my tame cattle wild into the woods, that the enemy might
not find them, and frequent the island in hopes of killing
the same. Secondly, I was for digging up my corn fields
for the very same reason. And, lastly, I concluded to de-
molish my bower, lest, seeing a place of human contrivance,
they might come farther, and find out, and attack me in my
little castle.
Such notions did the fear of danger suggest to me: and I
looked, I thought, like the unfortunate king Saul, when not
only opprefsed fay the Philistines, but also forsaken by God
himseTf. And, it is strange, that a little before, having en-
tirely resigned myself to the will of God, I should now have
little confidence in him, fearing those more who could kill
this fading body, than him who could destroy my immortal
soul.
Sleep was an utter stranger to my eyes that night; yet
nature spent and tired, submitted to a silent repose the next
morning, and then joined reason with fear, i considered
that this delightful and pleasant island might not be so en-
tirely forsaken as I might think ; but that the inhabitants
from the other shore might sail, either with a design or from.
necefsity, by cross winds; and, if the latter circumstance,
I had reason to believe they would depart the first oppor-
tunity. However, my fear made me think of a place for re- "treat upon an attack, 1 now repented that I had made my
door to come out beyond my fortification; to remedy whicti
I resolved to make me a second one: I fell to work, there-
fore, and drove betwixt that double rows of trees, which I
planted above twelve years before, several strong piles, thickening it with pieces of timber and old cables, and
strengthening the foot of it with earth which I dug out of my
cave; I also made me seven holes, wherein I planted my
muskets like cannon, fitting them into frames resembling
carriages. This being finished wilh indefatigable industry,
for a great way every where, I planted sticks of osiers like a
wood, about twenty thousand of them, leaving a large space
between them and my wall, that I might have room to see
an enemy, and that they might not be sheltered among the
young trees, if they offered to approach the outer wall.—And, indeed, scarce two years had passed over my head,
when there appeared a lovely shady grove, and in six years
it became a thick wood, perfectly impafsible. For my safe-
ty, I left no avenue to go in or out; instead of which I set
two ladders, one to a part of a rock which was low, and
then broke in, leaving room to place another ladder upon
that; so that when I took these down, it was impossible for
any man to descend without hurting himself; and if they
had, they would still be at the outside of my outer wall.—
But while I took all these measures of human prudence for
my own preservation, I was not altogther unmindful of other
affairs. To preserve my stock of tame goats, that the ene-
my should not take all at once, I looked out for the most F2
retired part of the island, which was the place where I had lost myself before-mentioned, and there finding a clear piece
ofIand, containing three acres, surrounded with thick woods,
I wrought so hard, that in less than a month's time, I fenced
it so well round, that my flocks were very well secured in
it, and put therein two he-goats and ten she-goats.
All this labour was occasioned purely by fearful appre-
hensions, on account of seeingthe print of a man's foot.—
And not contented yet with what I had done, I searched
for another place towards the west point of the island,
where I might also retain another flock. Then wandering
on this errand more to the west of the island than ever 1 had
yet done, and casting my eyes towards the sea, methought
\ perceived a boat at a great distance, but could not polsi-
Lly tell what it was for want of my perspective glass. I
considered then it was no strange thing to see the print of
a man's foot; and concluding them cannibals, blessed God
for being cast on the other side of the island, where none of
the savages, as I thought, ever came. But when I came
down the hill to the shore, which was the S. W. point of
the island, I was soon confirmed in my opinion; nor can
any one describe my horror and amazement, when I saw
the ground spread with skulls, hands, feet, and bones of
human bodies; and, particularly I perceived a space like
a circle, in the midst of which had been a fire, about which
I conjectured these wretches sat, and unnaturally sacrificed
and devoured their fellow-creatures.
The horror and loathsomenefs of this dreadful spectacle,
both confounded my senses, and made me discharge from my
stomach in aii exctfsive manner. I then returned towards
my habitation; and, in my way thither, shedding floods of
tears, und falling down on my bended knees, gave God
thanks for making my nature contrary to these wretches,
and delivering me so long out of their hands.
Though reason and my long residence here had assured me, that these savages never came up to the thick woody
part of the country, and that I had no reason to be appre-
hensive of a discovery; yet such an abhorrence did I still
retain, that, for two years after, J confined myself only to
my fhree plantations; I mean my castle, country-seat, and
inclosure in the woods. And though in proce's of time my
dreadful apprehensions began to wear away, yet my
were more vigilant for fear of being surprised, and I
w
very cautious of firing my gun,lest, being heard by those
creatures, they should proceed to attack me. I resolved,
however, manfully to lose my life if they did, and went
armed with three pistols stuck to my girdle, which, added
to the description I have given of myself before, made me
look with a very formidable appearance.
Thus my circumstances for some time remained very
calm and undisturbed: and when I compared my condition
to others, I found it far from being miserable. And, indeed,
would all persons compare their circumstances, not with
those above them, but with those innumerable unhappy ob-
jects beneath them, I am sure we should not hear fhose
'daily mdrmurings and complainings that are in the world.
For my part, I wanted but few things. Indeed, the terror
which the savages had put me in, spoiled some inventions
for my own conveniences. One of my projects was to brew
me some beer; a very whimsical one indeed, when it is
considered that I had neither casks sufficient, nor could I
make any to preserve it in; neither had I hops to make it
keep, yeast to make it work, nor a copper or kettle to boil it in. Perhaps, indeed, after some years I might bring
this to bear, as I had done other things. But now my inven-
tions were placed another way; and day and night 1 could
think of nothing but how I might destroy some of these
cannibals, when proceeding to their bloody entertainments;
and so saving a victim from being sacrificed, that he might
after become my servant. Many were my contrivances
after this purpose, and as many more objections occurred,
after I had hatched them. I once contrived to dig a hole under the place where they made their fire, and put therein
five or six pounds of gunpowder, which would consequent! v
blow up all those that were near it; and then I was loth to.
spend so much upon them, lest it should not do that certain
execution I could desire, and but only affright and not kili
tfjein. Having laid this design aside, 1 again proposed to
myself to lie privately in ambush, iu some convenient place, with my three guns double loaded, and let fly at them in the midst of their dreadful ceremony : and having killed
two or three of them at every shot, tall upon the rest sud-
denly with my three pistols, and not let one inethtr's si..n
escape... This imagination pleased my fancy so much, th i? t'!TK'• T.o T1"'1 ":.v deaigu.
L 't

in execution, I was not long in seeking for a place conve-
nient for my purpose, where unseen I might behold every
action of the savages. Here I placed my two muskets,
each of which was loaded with a brace of slugs, and four
or five smaller bullets about the size of pistol bullets -T the
fowling-piece was charged with near a handful of the largest
swan shot, and in every pistol was about four bullets.—And thus all things being prepared, no sooner would the
welcome light spread over the element, but, like a giant re-
freshed iuit& ivine, as the Scripture has it, would I ifsue forth
from my castle, and from a lofty hill, three miles distant,
view if I could see any invaders approach unlavrfully to
my kingdom. But having waited in vain two or three
months, it not only grew very tiresome to me, but brought
me to some consideration, and made me examine myself,
what right I had to kill these creatures in this manner.
If (argued I to myself) this unnatural custom of theirs be
a sin offensive to Heaven, it belongs to the Divine Being, who alone has the vindictive power in his hands, to shower
down his vengeance upon them. And, perhaps he does so,
in making them become one another's executioners. Or,
if not, if God thinks these doings just, according to the
knowledge they conceive, what authority have I to pretend to thwart the decrees of Providence, which has permitted
these actions for so many ages, perhaps from almost the beginning of the creation? they never offended me, what right have I then to concern myself in their shedding one
another's blood? and, indeed, I have since known, they value no more to kill and.devour a captive taken in war,
than we do to kill an ox, or eat mutton. I then concluded
it necelsnrily followed, that these people were no more
murderers than Christians, who many times put all troops to the sword, after throwing down their arms.—Again, I considered, that if I fell upon them, I should be as much in
il.e wrong as the Spaniards, who had committed the great-
iLs.t barbarities upon these people who had never offended
them in their whole lives; as if the kingdom of Spain was
eminent for a race of men without common compassion to
the miserable, a principal sign of the most generous temper:
these considerations made me pause, and made me think I
had taken wrong measuresin my resolution: I now argued
with myself, it was better for me never to attack, but to re-
main undiscovered as long as 1 pofsi.bly could; that an op-
posite conduct would certainly prove destructive; for as it
was scarcely to be supposed I could kill them all, I might
either be overpowered by the remaimng, or that some
escaping, might bring thousands to my certain destruction.
And, indeed, religion took their part so much as to convince
me how contrary it was to my duty to be guilty of shedding human blood, innocent as to my particular, whatever they
are to one another; that I had nothing to do with it, but
leave it to the God of all power and dominion, as I said
before, to do therein what seemed convenient to his heavenly
wisdom. And, therefore on my knees I thanked the Al-
mighty for delivering me from blood guiltiness, and begged
his protection that I might never fall into their hands.
Thus giving over an attempt which I had rashly begun, I
never ascended the hill on that occasion afterwards: 1 only
removed my boat, which lay on the other side of the island, and every thing that belonged to her, towards the east,- into
a little cove, that there might not be the least shadow of any
boat near, or habitation upon the island.—My castle then
became my cell, keeping always retired in it, except when
I went out to milk my she-goats, and order my little flock in
the wood, which was quite out of danger: for sure I was
that these savages never came here with expectations to
find any thing, and consequently never wandered from the
coast: however, as they might have been several times on
shore, as well before as after my dreadful apprehensions, I
looked back with horror to think in what stute 1 might have
been, had I suddenly met them slenderly armed, with one
gun only loaded with small shot; and how great would
have been my amazement, if, instead of one man's foot, I
had perceived fifteen or twenty savages, who having once
set their eyes upon me, by the swiftnefs of their feet would
have left me no possibility of escaping? These thoughts
would sink my verv soul, so that I would fall into a deep
melancholy, till such time as the consideration of my grati-
tude to the Divine Being moved it from my heart. 1 then-
fell into a contemplation of the sacred springs of Providence, and how wonderfully we are delivered, when insensible of
it; and when intricated in uncertain mazes or labyrinths of
doubt or hesitation, what secret hints direct us in the right
way, when we intended to go out of it; nay,. perhaps contrary to our business, sense, or inclination. Upon which, I

secret impressions of the mind, to the acting or not acting
any thing that offered, for which I yet could assign no rea-
son. But let it be how it will, the advantage of this con-
duct very eminently appeared in the latter part of my abode
on this island; I am a stranger in determining whence these
secret intimations of Providence derive; yet methinks thev
are not only some proof of the converse of spirits, but also
of the secret communications they are supposed to have
with those that have not passed through the gloomy vale of
death.
These anxieties of mind, and the care of my preservation,
put a period to alt future inventions and contrivances, either
for accommodation or convenience. 1 now cared not to
drive a nail, chop a stick, fire a gun, or make a fire, lest
either the noise should be heard, or the smoke discover me.
And on this account I used to burn my earthen ware privately
in a cave which I found in the wood, and which I made
convenient for that purpose; the principal cause that
brought me here was to make charcoal, so that I might bake
and dress my bread and meat without any danger. At that
time a curious accident happened me, which 1 shall now
relate.
While I was cutting down some wood for making my
charcoal, I perceived a cavity behind a very thick branch
of underwood. Curious to look into it, I attained its mouth,
and perceived it sufficient for me to stand upright in. But
when I had entered, and took a further view, two rolling
shining eyes, liky flaming stars, seemedjo dart themselves
at me; so that I made all the haste out that I could, as not
knowing whether it was a devil or a monster that had' taker*
his residence in that place. When I recovered a little from
my surprise, I called myself a thousand fools, for being
afraid to see the devil one moment, who had now lived
almost twenty years in the most retired solitude. And
therefore resuming all the courage I had, I took a flaming
firebrand, and in I rushed again. I had not proceeded
above three steps, when I was more affrighted than before;
for then I heard a very loud sigh, like that of a human crea-
ture in the greatest agony, succeeded with a broken noise,
resembling words half expressed, and then a broken sigh
again. Stepping back, Lord ! (thought I to myself) where
am I got, into what enchanted place have I plunged my-
self, such as are reported to contain miserable captives; tili
death puts an end to their sorrows? and, indeed, in such
great amazement was I, that it struck me into a cold sweat;
and had my hat been on my head, I believe my hair would
have moved it off. But again encouraging myself with the
hopes of God's protection, I proceeded forward, and by the
light of my firebrand, pcrcieved it to be a monstrous he-goat,
lying on the ground, gasping for life, and dying of mere old
age. At first J stirred him, thinking to drive him out, and
the poor ancient creature strove to get upon his feet, but
was not able; so I e'en let him lie still to affright the sava-
ges, should they venture into this cave. I now looked
round me and found the place but small and shapelefs. At
fhe farther side of it, I perceived a sort of an entrance, yet
so low, it must oblige me to creep upon my hands and
knees to it; so, having no candle, I suspended my enter-
Erise till the next day, and then I came provided with two
irge ones of my own making.
Having crept upon my hands and feet through this strait,
I found the roof higher up, I think about twenty feet. But
surely mortal never saw such a glorious sight before! The
roof and walls of this cave reflected a hundred thousand
lights to me from my two candles, as though they were in-
dented with shining gold, precious stones, or sparkling
diamonds. And, indeed, it was the most delightful cavity or
grotto of its kind, that could be desired, though entirely
dry. The floor was dry and level, and had a kind of
gravel upon it; no nauseous venomous creatures to be seen
there, neither any damp or wet about it. I could find no
fault but in the entrance, and I began to think that even
this might be very necessary for my defence, and therefore
resolved to make it my most principal magazine. I brought
hither two fowling-pieces, and three muskets, leaving only
live pieces at my castle, planted in the nature of cannon.
Of the barrel of gunpowder which I took up out of the sea,
I brought away about sixty pounds of good powder, which
was not damaged; and this, with a great quantity of lead
for bulic-iSj I removed from my castle to this retreat, now
fortified both by art and nature.
I fancied myself now like one of the giants of old, who
were said to live in caves and holes among the rocks, inac-
cefsible to any but themselves; or, at least, a most danger-
ous attempt. And now I despised both the cunning and
strength of the savages, either to find me out or to hurt me.
I.IFB AND ADVENTURES
But I must not forget the old goat, which caused my late
dreadful amazement. The poor creature gave up the
ghost the day after my discovery; and it being difficult to
drag him out, I dug his grave, and honourably entombed
him in the same place where he departed, with as much
ceremony as any Welch goat that has been interred about
the high mountain Penmanmawr.
I think I now was in the twenty-third year of my reign,
and my thoughts much easier than formerly, having contri-
ved several pretty amusements and diversions to pass away
the time in a pleasant manner. By this time my pretty Poll
had learned to speak English, and pronounce his words
very articulately and plain; so that for many hours we used
to chat together after a familiar manner, and he lived with
me no less than twenty-six years. My dog, which was
nineteen years old, sixteen of which he lived with me, died
some time ago of mere old age. As for my cats, they mul-
tiplied so fast, that I was forced to kill or drive them into
the woods, except two or three which became my particular
favourites. Besides these, I continually kept two or three
household kids about me, which I learned to feed out of my
hand, and two more parrots which could talk indifferently,
and rail Rcbimon Crusoe, but not so excellently as the first,
as not taking that pains with them. I had also several sea-
fowls which I had wounded and cut their wings; and
growing tame, they used to breed among the low trees
about my castle wall?, all which made my abode very
agreeable.
But what unforeseen events suddenly destroy the enjoy-
ment of this uncertain state of lift•, when we least expect
them! It was now the month of December, in the southern
solstice, and particular time of my harvest, which required
my attendance in the fields; when going out pretty early
one morning, before it was day-light, there appeared to me
from the sea-shore, a flaming light, about two miles from me
at die east end of th': Island, where I had observed some
savages had been beiore, not on the other side, but to my
great affliction, it was on my side the island.
Struck with a terrible surprise, and my usual apprehen-
sions, that the savages would perceive my improvements, I
returned directly to my castle, pulled the ladder after me,
making all things look as wild and natural as I possibly could. In the next place, I put myself in a posture of defence, loaded my muskets and pistols, and committing
myself to God's protection, I resolved to defend myself till
my last breath. Two hours after, impatient for intelligence,
I set my ladder up to the side of the hill, where there was
a flat place, and then pulling the ladder after me, ascended
to the top, where, laying myself on my belly, with my per-
spective glass, I perceived no less than nine naked savages,
sitting round a small fire, eating, as I supposed, human flesh,
with their two canoes haled on shore, waiting for the flood
to carry them off again. You cannot easily express the
consternation I was in at this sight, especially seeing them
near me; but when I perceived their coming must be
always with the current of the ebb, I became more easy in
my thoughts, being fully convinced that I might go abroad
with security all the time of flood, if they were not before
landed. And, indeed, this proved just as I imagined; for
no sooner did they all take boat and paddle away, but the
tide made N. W. Before they went off, they danced,
making ridiculous postures and gestures, for above an hour,
all stark-naked: but whether men or women, or both, I
could not perceive. When I saw them gone, I took two
guns upon my shoulders, and placing a couple of pistols in
my belt, with my great sword hanging by my side, I went
to the hill, where at first I made a discovery of these can-
nibals and then saw there had been three canoes more of
the savages on shore at that place, which with the rest were
making over to the main land.
But nothing could be more horrid to me, when going to
the place of sacrifice, the blood, the bones, and other mangled
parts of human bodies appeared in my sight; and so fired
was I with indignation, that I was fully resolved to be re-
venged on the first that came there, though I lost my life
in the execution. It then appeared to me, that the visits
which they make to this island are not very frequent, it be-
ing fifteen months before they came again: but still
I was very uneasy, by reason of the dismal apprehensions of their surprising me unawares; nor dared I offer to fire a
gun on that side of the island where they used to appear,
lest, taking the alarm, the savages might return with many
hundred canoes, and then God knows in what manner I
should have made my end. Thus was I a year or more be-
fore I saw any of these devouring cannibals again.

But to wave this, the following accident, which demands
attention, for a while eluded the force of my thoughts in
revenging myself on those heathens.
On the 16th of May (according to my wooden calendar)
the wind blew exceedingly hard, accompanied with abun-
dance oflightening and thunder all day, and succeeded by a
very stormy night. The seeming anger of the Heavens
made me have recourse to my bible. Whilst I was seri-
ously pondering upon it, I was suddenly alarmed with the
noise of a gun, which I conjectured was fired upon the
ocean. Such an unusual surprise made me start up in a
minute, when, with my ladder, ascending the mountain as
before, that very moment a flash of fire presaged the report
of another gun, which I presently heard, and found it was
from that part of the sea where the current drove me away.
I could not but then think, that this must be a ship in dis-
trels, and that these were the melancholy signals for a
speedy deliverance. Great, indeed, was my sorrow upon
this occasion; but my labours to assist them must have
proved altogether vain and fruitless. However, I brought
together all the dry wood that was at hand, and making a
pretty large pile, set it on fire on the hill. I was certain
they plainly perceived it, by their firing another gun as soon
as it began to blaze, and after that several more from the
same quarter. All night long I kept up my fire: and
when the air cleared up, I perceived something a great way
at sea directly E. but could not distinguish what it was,
even with my glass, by reason the weather was so very
foggy out at sea. However, keeping my eyes directly fixed
upon it, and perceiving it did not stir, I presently concluded
it must be a ship at anchor, and so very hasty I was to be
satisfied, that taking the gun, I went to the S. E. part of the
island, to the same rocks where I had been formerly drove
away by the current: in which time the weather being
perfectly cleared up, to my great sorrow, I perceived the
wreck of a ship cast away upon those hidden rocks I found
when I was out with my boat; and which, by making a
kind of an eddy, were the occasion of my preservation.
Thus, what is one man's safety is another's ruin; for un
-doubtedly thisMiip had been driven on them in the night,
the wind blowing strong at E. N. E. Had they perceived
the island, as I now guess they had n6t, eertainlft instead
of firing their guns for help, they would rather rave ven•
tured in their boat, and saved themselves that way. I then
thought, that perhaps they had done so, upon seeing mv
.'ire, and were cast away in the attempt; for 1 psrceived
no boat in the ship. But then I again imagined, that, per-
haps they had another vessel in company, which, upon
signal, saved their lives, and took the boat up: or that the
boat might be driven into the main ocean, where these poor
creatures might be in the most miserable condition. But as all these conjectures were very uncertain, I could do no
more than commiserate their distress, and thank God for
delivering me, in particular, when so many perished in the raging ocean.
When I considered seriously every thing concerning this
wreck, and could perceive no room to suppose any of then*.
saved, I cannot explain, by any possible force of words, what
longings my soul felt on this occasion, often breaking out
in this manner: "O that there had been but two or three,
nay, even one person saved, that we might have lived
"together, conversed with, and comforted one another!"
and so much were my desires moved, that when I repeated
these words, "Oh! that there had been but one!" my
hands would clench together, and my fingers prefs the
palms of my hands so close, that, had any soft thing been
between, it would have crushed it involuntarilv, while my
teeth would strike together, and set against each other so
strong, that it required sdme time for me to part them.
Till the last year' of n^y being on this island, I never
knew whether or not any had been saved out of this ship.
I had the affliction, some time after, to see the corpse of a
drowned boy come on shore, at the end of the island which
was next the shipwreck; there was nothing on him but a
seaman's waistcoat, a pair ot opened-kneed linen drawers,
and a blue linen shirt, but no particular mark to guess what
nation he was of. In his pocket were two pieces of eight, and a tobacco-pipe, the lavt ot which I preferred much
more than I did the first Ar.d now the calmness of the
sea tempted me to venture out in my boat to this wreck,
not only to get something necessary out of the ship, but
perhaps" some livirg creature might be on board, whose
life I might preserve. This had such an influence upon
my mind, that immediately I went home, and prepared
every thing necefsary for the voyage, carrying on board * G"
my boat provisions of all sorts, with a good quantity of rum,
fresh water, and a compass: so putting off, I paddled the
canoe along the shore, till I came at last to the north-east
part of the island, from whence I was to launch into the
ocean; but here the currents ran so violently, and appeared
so terrible, that my heart began to fail me; foreseeing that
if I was driven into any of these currents, I might be car-
ried not only out of reach or sight of the island, but even
inevitably lost in the boiling surges of the ocean.
So oppressed was I at these troubles, that I gave over
my enterprise, sailing to a little creek on the shore, where
stepping out, I set me down on a rising hill, very pensiv*
and thoughtful. 1 then perceived that the tide was turned,
and the flood came on, which made it impracticable for me
to go out for so many hours. To be more certain how the
sets of the tides or currents lay when the flood came in, I
ascended a higher piece of ground, which overlooked the
sea both ways; and here I found that as the current of the
ebb set out close by the south point of the island, so the
current of the flood set in close by the shore of the north
side; and all that I had to do, was to keep to the north of
the island in my return.
That night I reposed myself in my canoe, covered with
ciy watch-coat, instead of a blanket, the heavens being my
tester. I set out with the first of the tide lull north, till I
fir It the benefit of the current, which carried me at a great
rate eastward, yet not with such impetuosity as before, as
to take from me all government of my canoe; so that in
two hours time 1 came up to the wreck, which appeared
to me a most melancholy sight. It seemed to be a Spanish
vessel by its building, stuck fast between two rocks; her
stern and quarter beaten to pieces by the sea; her main-
mast and foremast were brought offby the board, that is,
broken off short. As I approached near, I perceived a dog
on board, who, seeing me coming, yelped and cried, and
«o sooner did I call him, but the poor creature jumped into
the sea, out of which I took him up, almost famished with
hunger and thirst; so that when I gave him a cake of bread,
no ravenous wolf could devour it more greedily; and ha
tlrank to that degree of fresh water, that he would have
burst himself, had I suffered him.
The first sight I met with in the ship, were two men
drowned in the cook-room or foreeaitle, inclosed in one another's arms: hence I very probably supposed,thai when
(he vefsel struck in the storm, so high and incessantly did
the waters break in and over her, that the men not being
able to bear it, were strangled by the constant rushing in of
the waves. There were several casks of liquor, whether
wine or brandy I could not be positive, which lay in the
lower hold, as were plainly perceptible by the ebbing out
of the water, yet were too large for me to pretend to med-
dle with; likewise I perceived several chests, which I
supposed to belong to the seamen, two of which I got into
my boat, without examining what was in them. Had the
stern of the ship baen fixod, ttnrl the forepart broken off', I
should have made a very prosperous voyage; since, by
what I after found in these two cheats, 1 "could not other-
wise conclude, but that the ship must have abundance of
wealth on board 5 nay, if I must guess by the course sh«
iteered, she must have been bound from Buenos Ayres, or the Rio de la Plata, in the southern parts of America,
beyond the Brazils, to the Havannah, in the gulf of Mexico,
and so perhapi to Spain. What became of the rest of the
tailors, I could not certainly tell; and all her riches signi-
fied nothing at that time to any body.
Searching farther, I found a cask, containing about
twenty gallons, full of liquor, which, with some labour, I
got into my boat \ in her cabin were several muskets, which
Ilet remain there, but took away with me a great powder-horn, with about four pounds of powder in it. I took also
* fire-shovel and tongs, two brass kettles, a copper pot to
make chocolate, and a gridiron: all which were extremelv
necel'sary to me, especially the fire-shovel and tongs. And
so with this cargo, accompanied with my dog, I came
away, the tide serving for that purpose: and the same
evening, about an hour within night, I attained the island,
after the greatest toil and fatigue imaginable.
That night I reposed my weary limbs in the boat, re-
solving the next morning to harbour what I had gotten in
my new-found subterraneous grotto; and not to carry
my cargo home to my ancent castle. Having refreshed
myself, and got all my effects on shore, I next proceeded
to examine the particulars; and so tapping the cask, I
found the liquor to be a kind of rum, but not like what we
had at the Brazils, nor indeed near so good. At the openG2
ing of the chest, several things appeared verv useful kt me,
for instance, I found in one a very fine case of bottles, con-
taining the finest and best sorts of cordial waters; each
botile he'd about three pints, curiously tipt with silver. I
found also two pots full of the choicest sweetmeats, and
two more which the water had utterly spoiled. There
were likewise several good shirts, exceedingly welcome to
me, and about one dozen and a half of white linen handker-
chiefs and coloured neckcloths, the former of which was
absolutely ntcclsary fi.r wiping my face in a hot day; and,
in the til1, I found three bags of pieces of eight, about eleven
hundred in all, in one of which, decently wrapped up in a
piece of paper, wcre six doubloons of gold, and some small
bars and wedges of the same metal, which I believe might
weigh near a pound. In the other chest, which I guelsed
to belong to the gunner's mate, by the mean circumstance*
which attended :t, 1 found onlv some clothes of very little
A.ilue, except about two pounds of fine glazed powder, in
tl.ree tla.sks,-kept, a, I believe, forchjrghg their fowiing-
| it.ct.3 on any occasion; so that in the whole, I had no
great advantage by this voyage. The money was indeed
a.i ruLre dirt to me, useless and unprofitable, all which I
would have freely parted with for two or three pair ol Eng-
]:sh shoes and stockings; things that for many years I had
not worn, except lately those which I had taken off the feet
of those unfortunate men I found drowned in the wreck,
yet not so go!:d as English shoes, either for ease or service.
I also found in the seaman's chest about fifty pieces of eight
in royals, but no gold; so concluded that what I took
from the fust belonged to an officer, the latter appearing
to have a much inferior person tor its owner. However,
as despicable as the money seemed, I likewise lugged it to
my cave, laying it up securely as I did the rest of my
cargo; and after I had done all this, I returned back to
my boat, rowing and paddling her along till I came to my
i.ld hail:onr, where I carefully laid her up, and so made the
best of my way to my castle. When I arrived there, every
thing seemed safe and quiet: so that now my only business was LO repose. myself after my wonted manner, and take
care of my domestic affairs. But though I might have lived
very easy, as wanting nothing absolutely needful; yet
si ilt I was more vigilant than usual upon account of the sa-
vages, never going much abroad; or, if I did, it was to Ike
east part of the island, where I was well assured that the
savages never came, and where I might not be troubled to
carry that heavy load of weapons for my defence, as I was
obliged to do if I went the other way.
Two years did I live in this anxious condition, in all which
time, contrary to my former resolutions, my head was filled
with nothing but projects and designs, how I might escape
from this island; and so much were my wandering thoughts
bent upon a rambling disposition, that had I had the same
boat that I went from Salee in, I should have ventured
once more to the uncertainty of the raging ocean.
I cannot, however, but consider myself as one of the un-
happy persons, who make themselves wretched by their
dissatisfaction with the station which God has placed them
in; for not to take a review of my primitive condition, and
my father's excellent advice, the going contrary to which
was, as I-may say, my original sin, the following mistakes
of the same nature certainly had been the means of my pre-
sent unhappy station. What business had I to leave a set-
tled fortune and well stocked plantation, improving and
increasing, where, by this time, I might have been worth
a hundred thousand moidores, to turn super-cargo to
Guinea, to fetch Negroes, when time and patience would
so much enlarge my stock at home, as to be able to employ
those whose more immediate business was to fetch them
home even to my door. But as this is commonly the fafe of young heads, so a se-
rious reflection upon the folly of it ordinarily attends the
exercise of future years, when the dear-bought experience
of time teaches us repentance. Thus was it with me; but
notwithstanding the thoughts of my deliverance ran so
strongly in my mind, that it seemed to check all the dictates
of reason and philosophy. And now to usher in my kind
reader, with greater pleasure to the remaining part of my
relation, I flatter myself it will not be taken amiss, to give
him an account of my first conceptions of the manner of
escaping, and upon what foundation I laid my foolish
schemes.
Having retired to my castle, after my late voyage to the
ship, my frigate laid up and secured, as usual, and my con-
dition the same as before, except being richer, though I had
as little occasion for riches as the Indians of Peru had for G 3
gold, before the cruel Spaniards came among them: one night in March, being the rainy season, in the four and
twentieth year of my solitude, I lay down to sleep, very
well in health, without distemper, pain, or uncommon un-
easinefs either of body or mind; yet, notwithstanding, I
could not compose myself to sleep all the night long. All this tedious while, it is impossible to express what innumer-
able thoughts came into my head. I traced quite over the
whole history of my life in miniature, from my utmost re-
ir.embrance of things till I came to this island, and then
proceeded to examine every action and pafsage that had
occurred since I had taken possession of my kingdom. In
my reflections upon the latter, I was comparing the happy
posture of my affairs in the beginning of my reign, to this
life of anxiety, fear, and concern, since I had discovered a
print of a foot in the sand; that while I continued without
apprehension, I^was incapable of feeling the dread and ter-
ror I now suffered. How thankful rather ought I to
have been for the knowledge of my danger, since the
greatest happiness one can be pofsefsed of is to have suffi-
cient time to provide against it f How stupendous is the
goodness of Providence, which sets such narrow bounds to
the sight and knowledge of human nature, that while men
walk in the midst of so many dangers, they are kept serene
and calm, by having the events of things hid from their eyes,
and knowing nothing of those many dangers that surround
them, till perhaps they are dissipated and vanish away.
When I came more particularly to consider of the real
danger I had lor so many years escaped; how I had walked about in the greatest security and tranquillity, at a time,
perhaps, when even nothing but the brow of a hill, a great
tree, or the common approach of night, had interposed be-
tween me and the destructive hands of the cannibals, who
would devour me with as good an appetite, as I would a
pigeon or cinlcw; surely all this, I say, could not but
make me sincerely thankful to my great Preserver, whose
singular protection I acknowledge with the greatest humi-
lity, and without which I must inevitably have fallen into
the cruel hands of those devourers.
Having thus discussed my thoughts in the clearest man-
ner, according to my \\eak understanding•, I next proceeded
to consider the wretched nature of those destroying savages,
r.y seeming. though with great reverence, to mouire, \vhy
Cud should give up any of his creatures to such
even to brutality itself, to devour its own kind? but as this
was rather matter of abstruse speculation, and as my miser-
able situation made me think this of mine the most uncom-
fortable situation in the world, I then began rather to inquire
what part of the world these wretches lived in; how far oft'
the coast was from whence they came; why they ventured
over so far from home; what kind of boats conveyed them
hither; and why I could not order myself and my businufs
so, that I might be as able to attain their country, as they
were to come to my kingdom?
But, then, thought I, how shall I manage myself when I
come thither? what will become of me if I fall into the
hands of the savages? or how shall I escape from them, if
ttiey mike an attempt upon me? and supposing I should not
fall into their power, what shall I do for provisions, or which
way shall I bend my course? These counter-thoughts threw
me into the greatest horror and confusion imagmable; but
then I still looked upon my present condition to be the most
miserable that pofsible could be; and that nothing could be
worse, except death. For (thought I) could I but attain
the shore of the main, I might perhaps meet with some re-
lief, or coast it along, as I did with my boy Xury, on the
African shore, till i came to some inhabited country, where
I might meet with some relief, or fall in with some Christian
ship that might take me in; and if I failed, why then I could
but meet with death, which would putan end to all my mise-
ries. These thoughts, I insist confefs, were.the fruit of a dis-
tempered mind, an impatient temper made desperate, as it
were, by long continuance of the troubles and disappoint-
ments I had met with in the wreck, where I hoped to have
found some living persons to speak to, by whom I might
have known in what place I was, and of the probable means
of my deliverance. Thus, while my thoughts were agitated,
my resignation to the will of Heaven were entirely suspend-
ed, s:t that I had no power to fix my mind to any thing, but
to the project of a voyage to the main land. And, indeed,
so much was [ inflamed upon this account, that it set my
blood into a ferment, and my pulse beat high, as though I
had been in a lever; till nature being, as it were, fatigued
and exhausted with the thoughts of it, made ma sulmit
mj self to a silent repose.
In such a situation, it is very strange, that I did not
dream of what I was so irteiH up-tn ; but, instead of it, my
mind roved on a quite different thii'g, altogether forefgn.
1 dreamed, that as I was issuing from jny castle one morn-
ing, as customary, when 1 perceived upon the shore two
canoes, and eleven savages coming to land, who had brought
with them another Indian, whom they designed to make a
sacrifice of, in order to devour; but just as they were going
to give the fatal blow, methought the poor designed victim
jumped away, and ran directly into my little thick grove
before my fortification, to abscond from his enemies, when
perceiving that the others did not follow him that way, I
appeared to him; that he humbly kneeled down before
me, seemed to pray for my assistance; upon which I
showed him my ladder, made him ascend, carried him to
my cave, and he became my servant; and when I had
gotten this man, I said to myself, now surely I may have
some hopes to attain the main land; for this fellow will
serve me as a pilot, tell me what to do, and where I must
go for provisions, what places to shun, what to venture to,
and what to escape. But when I awaked, and found all
these inexprefsible imprefsions of joy entirely vanished, I
fell into the greatest dejection of spirits imaginable.
Yet this dream brought me to reflect, that one sure way
of escaping was to get a savage; that after I had ventured
my life to deliver him from the bloody jaws of his devourers,
the natural sense he might have of such a preservation,
might inspire him with a lasting gratitude and most sincere
affection. But then this objection reasonably interposed:
how can I effect this, thought I, without I attack a whole
company of them, and kill them all ? why should I proceed
on such a desperate attempt, which my scruples before had
suggested to be unlawful? and indeed my heart trembled
at the thoughts of so much blood, though it were a means
to procure my deliverance. 'Tis true, I might reasonably
enough suppose these men to be real enemies to my life,
men who would devour me, was it in their power; so that
it was self-preservation in the highest degree to free myself,
by attacking them in my own defence, as lawfully as if
they were actually assaulting me: though all these things,
I say, seemed to me to be of the greatest weight, yet, as I
just said before, the dreadful thoughts of shedding human
blood, struck such a terror to my soul, that it was a long
time before I could reconcile myself to it.
But how far will the ardency of desire prompt us on? for notwithstanding the many disputes and perplexities.! hud
with myself, I at length resolved, right or wrong, to get one
of these savages into my hands, cost what it would, or even
though I should lose my life in the attempt. Inspired with
this tirm resolution, I set all my wits at work, to find out
what methods I should take to answer my design: this, indeed, was so difficult a task, that I could not pitch upon any
probable means to execute it: I therefore resolved conti-
nually to be in a vigilant posture, to perceive when the sa-
vages came on shore, and to leave the rest to the event, let
the opportunities otter as they would.
Such was my fixed resolutions; and accordingly I set
myself upon the scout, as often as I could, till such time as I
was heartily tired of it. I waited for above a ye^r and. a
half, the greatest part of which I went out to the west and
south-west corner of the island, almost every day, to look
for canoes, but none appeared. This was a very great dis-
couragement; yet thoiigh 1 was very much concerned, the
edge of my design was as keen as ever, and the longer it
seemed to be delayed, the more eager was I for it; in a
word, I never before was so careful to shun the loathing
sight of these savages, as I was now eager to be with them;
and I thought mysetf sufficiently able to manage one, two,
or three savages, if I had them, so as to make them my en-
tire slaves, to do whatsoever I should direct them, and pre-
vent their being able at any time to do me a mischief. Many
times did I use to please myself with these thoughts, with
long and ardent expectations; but nothing prest.nting, all
my deep projected schemes and numerous fancies vanished
away, as though, while I retained such thoughts, the decrees
of Providence were such that no savages were to come near
me.
About a year and a half after, when I was seriously mus-
ing of sundry other ways how I should attain my end, one
morning early, I was very much surprised by seeing no less than five canoes all on shore together, on my side the island,
and the savages that belonged to them all landed, and out
of my sight. Such a number of them disconcerted all my
measures; for, seeing so many boats, each of which would
contain six, and sometimes more, I could not tell what to
think of it, or how to order my measures, to attack twenty
or thirty men, single-handed; upon which, much dispirited
and perplexed, I lay still in my castle; which, however, I
put in a proper posture for an attack; and'having formerly
provided all that was necefsary, was soon ready to enter upon an engagement, should they attempt. Having waited for some time, my impatient temper would let me bear it no
longer; I set my guns at the foot of my ladder, and, as
usual, ascended up to the top of the hill at two stages, stand-
ing, however, in such a manner, that my head did not ap-
pear above the hill, BO that they could not easily perceive
me; and here, by the assistance of my perspective glass, I
observed no fofo than thirty in number around u fire, feasting
upon what meat they had drafted i how they cooked it, or
what it wai,1 could not then perfectly tell; but they were
all dancing ond cnjiefing about the flamen, uitng many
frightful mid barbarous gestures.
But while, with a curious eve, I was beholding these wretches, my spirit! iitnk within me, when I perceived
them drag two miserable creatures from the boats, to act
nf'resh the dreadful tragedy, as I supposed they had done
"*1>ufore. It was not long before one of them fell upon the
ground, knocked down, as I suppose, with a club or wooden
sword, fur that was their manner j while two or three others went immediately to work, tutting him open for their cook*
cr,y, and then fell to devour him as they had done the for*
^ pier, while the last unhappy captive was left by himself,
'Jill such time as they were ready for him. The poor crea-
ture looked round him with a wishful eye, trembling at the
thoughts of death f yet, seeing himselfa little at liberty, na.
'lure, that very moment, as it were, inspired him with nopea
oflite: he started away from them, and ran, with incre-
dible swiftnefs, along the sands, directly to that part of the
coast where my ancient and venerable castle stood.
You may well imagine, I was dreadfully affrighted upon
this occasion, when, as I thought, they pursued him in a
whole body, all running towards my palace. And now,
indeed, I expected that part of my dream was going to
be fulfilled, and that he would certainly fly to my grove
for protection; but, for the rest of my dream, I could de-
pend nothing on it, that the savages would pursue him
thither, and find him there. However, my spirits begin-
ning to recover, 1 stiil kept upon my guard; and I now
plainly perceived there were but three men out of the num-
ber that pursued him. I was infinitely pleased with what
iwiftnefs the poor creature ran from his pursuers, gained so
much ground upon them, that I plainly perceived could he
thus hold out for'half an hour, there was not the least doubt
but he would save bis life from the power of his enemies.
Between them and my castle there was a creek, that
very same which I sailed into with all my effects from the
wreck of the ship, on the steep banks of which I very
much feared the poor victim would be taken, if he could
not swim for his escape: but soon was I out of pain for
him, when I perceived he made nothing of it, though at
full tide, but with an intrepid courage, spurred on by the
sense of danger, he plunged into the flood, swimming over
in about thirty strokes, and then landing, ran with the
same incredible strength and swiftness as before. When
the three pursuers came to the creek, one of them, who I
perceived could not swim, happily for iis part, returned
to his company, while the others, with equal courage, but
much lefs swiftnefs, attained the other side, as though they
were resolved never to give over the pursuit. And now
or never I thought was the time for me to procure me a
servant, companion, or afsistant; and that I was decreed
by Providence to be the instrument to save this poor crea-
ture's life. I immediately descended my two ladders with
the greatest expedition; I took up my two guns, which, I
said before, were at the bottom of them, and getting up
again with the same haste towards the hill, I made nearer
the sea. In a word, taking a short cut down the hill, I
interposed between the pursuers and pursued, hallooing
aloud to the latter, who, venturing to look back, was, no
doubt, as much terrified at me as I at them. I beckoned
to him with my hand, to return back; in the mean time
advancing towards the pursuers, and rushing on the fore-
most, I knocked him down with the stock of my piece,
and laid him flat on the ground. I was very unwilling to
fire, lest the rest should hear, though at a distance, I ques-
tioned whether they could or no; and being out of sight of
the smoke, they could not easily have known what to make
of it. The other savage seeing his fellow fall, stopped as
if he had been amazed; when, advancing towards him, I
could perceive him take his bow from his back, and, fix-
ing an arrow to it, was preparing to shoot at me, and, with-
out dispute, might have lodged the arrow in my breast;
but, in this absolutely necefsary case of self-preservation, I
immediately fired at him, and shot him dead, just as hit
haiid was going to draw the fatal string. All this while,
the savage who had iled before stood still, and had the s»-
tisfaction to see his enemies killed, as he thought, who de-
signed to take away his life; so affrighted was he with the
fire and nrise of my piece, that he stood, as it were, like
Lot's wife, fixed and immoveable, without either sense or
motion. This obliged me to halloo to him again, making
the plainest signs I could to him to draw nearer. I per-
ceived he understood those tokens by his approaching to
me a little way, when, as if afraid I should kill him too,
he stopped again. Several times did he advance, and as
often stop in this manner, till coming more to my view, I
perceived him trembling as if he was to undergo the same
tate. Upon which I looked upon him with a smiling
countenance, and still beckoning to him, at length he
came close to me and k"ecled down, kilsed the ground,
laid his head upon it, and taking me by the foot, set it
upon his head; and this, as I understood afterwards, was
a token of swearing to be my slave for ever. I took him
up, and, making much of him, encouraged him in the best
manner I could. But my work was not yet fimshed;
for I perceived the,savage whom Ihpd knocked down, was
not killed, but stunned with the blow, and began to come
to himself. Upon which I pointed to my new servant,and
showed him that his enemy was not yet expired; he spoke
some words to me, but which I could not understand; yet
being the first sound t.i'a man's voice I had heard for above
twenty-five }ears, tliey were very pleasing to me. But
there was no time for reflection now, the wounded savage
recovering himself so far as to sit upon the ground, which

The greatest astonishment that my.new servant conceived
was the manner of killing the savage at such a distance,
without a bow and arrow; and such was his longing desire
to know it, that he first pointed to the dead carcase, and
then made signs to me to grant him leave to go to him.
Upon which I bade him go, and, as well as I could, made
him sensible I granted his request. But when he came
there, how wonderfully was he struck with amazement!
First he turned him on one side, then on another, wonder-
ing he could perceive no quantity of blood, he bleeding
inwardly; and after sufficiently admiring the wound the bullets had made in his breast, he took up his bow and ar-
rows, and came back again: upon which I turned to go
away, making my signs to him to follow, lest the rest, mis-
sing their companions, might come in pursuit of them, and
this I found he understood very well; by his making me
understand that his design was to bury them, that they might
not be seen if it happened; and which by signs again I
made him sensible I very much approved of. Immediately
he fell to work, and never was grave-digger more dextrous
in the world than he was: for in an instant, as I might say,
he scraped a large hole in the sand with his hands, sufficient
to bury the first in; there he dragged him, and without any
ceremony he covered him over; in like manner he served
the other; so that I am sure no undertaker could be more
expert in his busineli j for all this was done in lef* than a
quarter of an hour. I then called him away, and mstead
ot carrying him directly to my castlu at first, 1 conveyed him
to my cave on the farther part of the island; and so my
dream was now fulfilled in that particular, that my grove
should prove an asylum or sanctnry to him.
Weary and iaint, hungry and thirsty, undoubtedly must
this poor creature be, supported chiefly by the vivacity of
spirit, and uncommon transports of joy thai iiis deliverances.
occasioned. Here I gave him bread and a bunch of raisins
to eat, and water to drink, on which he fed Very cheerfully,
to his exceeding refreshment. I then made him a conveni-
ent bed with a parcel of rice straw, and a blanket upon it,
(a bed which I used myself sometimes) and then pointing
to it, made signs lor him to lie down to sleep, upon which the poor creature went to take a welcome repose.
Indeed he was a very comely, handsome young fellow, eK-
tremdy wtH-made, with straight long limbs, not to« tare;.., 'H
but tall and well-shaped, and, as near as I could reckon,
about twenty-six years of age. His countenance had no-
thing in it fierce or surly, but rather a sort of majesty in his
face; and yet, especially when he smiled, he had all the
sweetness and softnels of an European. His hair was not
curled like wool, as many of the blacks are, but long and
black, with the most beautiful yet carelefs trefses spreading
over his shoulders. He had a very high and large forehead,
with a great vivacity and sparkling sharpnefs in his eyes.
His skin was not so tawney as the Virginian Brazilians, or
other Americans; but rather of a bright dun olive colour,
that had something agreeable in it, though not very easy to
give a description of. His face was round and plump, with
a small nose, very different from the flatnefs of the negroes,
a pretty small mouth, thin lips, fine teeth, very well set,
and white as the driven snow. In a word, such handsome
features, and exact symmetry in every part, made me con-
sider, that I had saved the life of an Indian prince, no lefs
graceful and accomplished than the great Oroonoko, whose
memorable behaviour, and unhappy contingencies of life,
have charmed the world, both to admiration of his person,
and compassion to his sufferings.
But let him be either prince or peasant, all my happinefs
centered in this, that I had now got a good servant or com-
panion, to whom, as he deserved, I was resolved to prove a
kind master, and a lasting friend. He had not, I think, slept
above an hour, when he awaked again, and while I was
milking my goats hard by, out he runs from the cave towards
me in my inclosure, and laying himself down on the
ground, in the lowest prostration, made all the antic gestures
imaginable, to express his thankfulness to me for being his
deliverer. I confefs, though the manner of his behaviour
seemed to be ludicrous enough to occasion laughter, yet I
was very much moved at his affection, so that my heart
melted within me, iearing he might die away in excess of
joy, like reprieved malefactors: especially as I was incapable
either to let him blood, or administer physic. It were
to be wished that Christians would take example by this
Heathen, to have a lasting remembrance of the benefits and
deliverances they have received, by the kind mediation
and powerful interposition of their benefactors and deliver-
ers: and it would be likewise happy for mankind, were there no occasion to blame many, who, instead ofthankfu
acknowledging favours and benefits, rather abase and con-
demn those who have been the instrumentsto save them
from destruction.
But leaving these just reflections, I return to the object
that occasioned them; for my man, to conclude the last
ceremony of obedience, laid down his head again on the
ground, close to my foot, and set my other foot upon his head, as he had done before, making all the signs of subjec-
tion, servitude, and submission imaginable, and let me un-
derstand he would serve me as long as his life endured. .As
I understood him in many things, I made him sensible I was
very well pleased with him; and, in a little time, I began
to speak to him, and learn him to talk to me again. In the
first place, I made him understand his name was to be Fri-
day, because it was upon that day I saved his lite; then I
taught him to say Master, which I made him sensible was
to be my name. I likewise taught him to say Yes and No,
and to know what they meant. I gave him sunn: milk man
earthen pot, making him view me while I drank it before
him, and soaked my bread in it; I gave him a cake of bread,
and caused him to soak it likewise, to which he readily con-
sented, making signs of the greatest satisfaction imaginable.
All that night did I keep him there; but no sooner did
the morning light appear, when I ordered him to arise,and
come along with me, with certain tokens that I would give
him some clothes like mine, at which he seemed very giad,
being stark naked, without the least covering whatever.—As we pafscd by the place where the two men had been
interred, my man pointed directly to their gruves, showing
me the marks that he had made to find them again, giving
me to understand, by signs, that we should dig them up,
and devour them. At this I appeared extremely displeased,
exprefsed my utmost abhorrence, as if 1 would vomit at the
apprehension of it, beckoning with my hand to come away,
which he did with the greatest reverence and submilsion.
After this I conducted him to the top of the hill, to view if
the rest of the savages were yet remaining there; but when
I looked through my perspective glals, 1 could see no ap-
pearance of them, nor of their canoes; so that it was very
evident they never minded their deceased companions whom
we had slam; which if they had, they would surely have
searched for, or left one boat behind for them to follow,
after they returned from their pursuit.
Curiosity, rind a desire of satisfaction, animating me with courage to see this scene of barbarity, I took my man Fri-
day with me, putting a sword into his hand, with the bow
and arrows at his back, which I perceived he could use
very dexterously, causing him to carry one gun for me, and
] two for myself; and thus equipped against all attacks,
away we marched directly to the place of their bloody en-
teitainment. Bat when I came there, I was struck with
the utmost horror at so dreadful a spectacle, whilst Friday
was noway concerned about it, being no doubt in his turn
one ofthese devourers. Here lay several human bones, there
several pieces of mangled flesh, half eaten, mangled and
scorched; whilst streams of blood ran promiscuously as
waters from a fountain. As I w.as musing on this dreadful
h:g!it, Friday took all the pains he could, by particular
signs, to make me understand, that they had brought over
four prisoners to/east upon, three of whom they had eaten
up, and that he was the fourth, pointing to himself; that
there having been a bloody battle between them and his great king, in the just defence of whom he was taken pri-
soner, with many others; all of these were carried off to
different places to be devoured by their conquerors; and
that it was his misfortune to be brought thither by these
wretches for the same purpose.
After I was made sensible of these things, I caused Fri-
day to gather those horrid remains, and lay them together
upon a heap, which* ordered to be set on fire, and burn
them to a«hes j My man, however, still retained the nature
of a cannibal, having a hankering stomach alter some of the
flesh; but such an extreme abhorrence did I express at the
least appearance of it, that he durst not but conceal it; for
I made him very sensible, that if he offered any such thing,
I would certainly shoot him.
This being done, I carried my man with me to my castle and gave him a pair of linen drawers, which I had taken
out of the poor gunner's chest beforementioned; and
which, with a little alteration, fitted him very well: in the
next place I made him a jerkin of goat's skin, such at iuy
skill was able to manage, and indeed I thought myself theji
» tolerable good tailor, 1 gave him also a cap which I
made of a hare'* skin, very convenient aud fashionable,,—
Thus being clothed tolerably well, my man was no less proud of his habit, than I was at seeing him in it. Indeed he went very awkwardly at first, the drawers being too heavy
on his thighs, not used to bear any weight, and the sleeves
of the waistcoat galled his shoulders and the inside of his
arms; but by a little easing where he complained they hurt
him, and by using himself to them, at length he took to
them very well.
My next concern was, where I should lodge him; and
that I might do well by him, and yet be perfectly easy my-
selfj ] erected a tent for him in the vacant place between
my two fortifications, in the inside of the last, and the out-
side of the first; and, as there was an entrance or door in-
to my cave, I made a formal framed door-case, and a door
to open on the inside; I barred it up in the night time, tak-
ing in my ladders too, so that, was my man to prove treach-
erous, there could be no way to come at me in the inside
of my innermost wall, without maiting so much noise in
getting over, that it must needs waken me; for my first
wall had now acomplete roof over it ol long poles, spread-
ing over my tent, and leaning up to the side of the moun-
tain, which was again laid across with smaller sticks instead of laths, and thatched over a great thickness with the rice
straw, which was as strong as reeds; and at the hole of the
place, left on purpose to go in and out by the ladder, I placed a kind of trap-door, which, if it had been attempted
on the outside, would not have opened at all, but have
iallen down, and made a great noise; and as to my wea-
pons, every night I took them all to my bedside.
But there was no occasion for this precaution; for surely
never master had a more sincere, faithful, and loving ser-
vant than Friday proved to mo. Without palsion, sullen-
nefs, or design, perfectly obliging and engaging, his affec-
tions were as much tied to me, as those of a child to its
parents; and I might venture to say, he would have sacri?
ficed his life for the saving mine, upon any occasion what-
soever. And, indeed, the many testimomes lie gave me of
this, sufficiently convinced me that I had no occasion to use
these precautions. And here I could not but reflect wi'tj
great \\onder, that,. however it hath pleased tlie Almighty
m his providence, and in the government of the creation,
to take From so great a part of the world of his creatures,
the noblest uses to which their faculties, and the powers of
beir soula are adapted; yet that he hss bestowed upon .
"" n s

them the same reason, affections sentiments of kindness and obligation, passions of resentment, sincerity, fidelity,
and all the capacities of doing and receiving good that he
has given us; and that when he is graciously pleased to
ofler them occasions of exerting these, they are as ready,
nay, more ready, to apply them to the proper uses for
which they were bestowed, than we often are. These
thoughts would make me melancholy, especially when I
considered how mean a use we make of all these, even
though we have these powers enlightened by the Holy
Spirit of God, and by the knowledge of this world, as an
addition to our understanding; and why it has pleased the
heavenly wisdom to conceal the like saving knowledge
Irom so many millions of souls, who would certainly make
a much better use of it than generally mankind do at this
time. These reflections would sometimes lead me so far
as to inveigh the sovereignty of Providence, and, as it were,
arraign the justice of such an arbitrary disposition of things,
that should obscure that light from some, and reveal it to
others, and yet expect a like duty from all. But I closed
it up, checking my thoughts with this conclusion; first,
That we were ignorant of that right and law by which
those should be condemned; but as the Almighty was ne-
cefsarily, and by the nature of his essence, infinitely just
and holy; so it could not be otherwise, but that if these
creatures were all destined to absence from himself, it was
on account of sinning against that light, which, as the
Scripture says, was a law to themselves, and by such a rule
as their consciences would acknowledge to be just, though
the first foundation was not discovered to us. And, se-
condly, Thai still as we were the clay in the hand of the
potter, no yefsel could thus say to him, " Why hast thou
- fashioned me after this manner."
i had not been above two or three days returned to my
castle, but my chief design was, how I should bring Friday
• fl' from this horrid way of feeding; and to take from him
that inhuman relish he by nature had been accustomed to,
I thought it my duty to let him taste other flesh, which
might the rather tempt him to the same abhorrence I so
often expressed against their accursed way of living. Upon
which, one morning I took him out with me, with an in-
tention to kill a kid out of the flock aad bring it home,. aw^
drefs it. As I was going, I perceived a she-goat ly^ng
down in the shade, and two young kids sitting by her.—
Immediately I catched hold of my man Friday, anu Hidiling
him stand still, and not stir, I presented my piece, and shot
one of the kids. My poor servant, who at a distance per-
ceived me kill his adversary, and yet did not know by what
means, or how it was done, stood trembling and surprised,
and looked so amazed, that I thought he would have sunk
into the earth. He did not see the kid I aimed at, or be-
hold I had killed it, but ripped up his waistcoat to see if he
was not wounded, thinking my resoiinion was to kill him;
for coming to me, he fell on his knees, earnestly pronounc-
ing many things which I did not understand the meaning
of; which at length I perceived was, that I would not
take away his life.
Indeed I was much concerned to see him in that con-
dition, where nature is upon the severest trial, when the
immediate hand of death is ready to put for ever a period
to this mortal life , and, indeed, so much compassion had I
to this creature, that it was with difficulty I refrained from tears. But, however, as another sort of countenance was
necessary, and to convince him that I would do him no
harm, I took him smiling by the hand, then laughing at
him, and pointing to the kid which I had slain, made signs
to him to fetch it, which accordingly he did. No less curious was he in viewing how the creature was killed, than
he had been before in beholding the Indian; which, while
he was admiring at, I charged my gun again, and presently
perceived a great fowl, like a hawk, perching upon a tree
within shot: and therefore, to let Friday understand what
I was going to do, I called him to me again, pointing at the
fowl, which I found to be a parrot. I made him under-
stand that I would shoot and kill that bird; accordingly I
fired, and bade him look, when immediately he saw the
parrot fall down. Again he stood like one amazed, not-
withstanding all I had said to him: and the more confound-
ed he was, because he did not perceive me put any thing
into my gun. Undoubtedly a thing so utterly strange,
carrying death along with it, far or near, either to man or
beast, must certainly create the greatest astonishment to one
who never had heard such a thing in his whole life; and
really his amazement continued so long, that had I allowed
it. ke would have prostrated himself before me and my gun,
with the greatest worship and adoration. As for the gun in particular, he would not so much as touch it for several
days afu r, but would come and communicate his thoughts
to it, and talk to it, as if the senseless piece had understood
and answered him; all this I could perceive him do, when
he thought my back was turned, the chief intent of which
was, to desire it not to kill him, as I afterwards came to
und&rstand.
I never strove to prevent his admiration, nor hinder him
from those comical gestures he used on such occasions; but
when his astonishment was a little over, I made tokens to
him to run and fetch the parrot that I had shot; which
accordingly he did, staying sometime longer than usual, by
reason the bird not being quite dead, had fluttered some
way further from the place where he fell. In the mean
time, he was looking for her, I took the advantage of
charging my gun again, so that I might be ready for any
other mark tliat ottered; but nothing more occurred at that
time. So I brought home the kid, and the same evening
took off the skin and divided the carcase as well as I could.
Part of the flesh 1 stewed and boiled in a pot I had for this purpose. And then spreading my table, I sat down, giv-
ing my man some of it to eat, who was wonderfully pleased,
and seemed to like it very well: but what was the most
surprising to him was to see me eat salt with it: upon
which he made me understand, that the salt was very bad
for m«; when putting a little into his mouth he seemed to
nauseate in such a manner, as to spit and splutter at it,
and then washed his mouth with fresh water: but to show
him how contrary his opinion was to mine, I put some
meat into my mouth without salt, and feigned to spit and
splutter as much for the want of it, as he had done at it;
yet all this proved of no signification to Friday; and it was
a long while before he could endure salt in his meat or broth,
and even then but a small quantity.
Thus having fed him sufficiently with boiled meat and
broth at that time, the next day I was resolved to feast him
with a roasted piece of the kid. And having to spit to
fasten it, nor jack to turn it, I made use of that common
artifice which many of the common people of England have,
that is, to set two poles upon each side of the fire, atfi
one across on the top, hanging the meat thereon wjlh Sft.
siting, and so turning round continually, roast it, itvC
same manner as we read bloody tyrants of old cruelly
ed the holy martyrs. This practice caused great admira-
tion in my man Friday, being quite another way than that
to which the savages were accustomed. But when he came
to taste the sweetness and tenderness of the flesh, he e.\-
prefsed his entire satisfaction above a thousand different
ways. And as I could not but understand his meaning, you
may be sure I was as wonderfully pleased, especially when
he made it also very plain to me, that he would never,
while he lived, eat man's flesh more.
It was now high time I should set my servant to work;
so next day I set him to beat out some corn, and sift it in
the same manner as I had done before. And really the fel-
low was very quick and handy in the execution of any thing
I ordered him to go about. I made him understand that it
was to make bread for us to eat, and afterwards let him see
me make it. In short, he did every thing as I ordered him,
and in a little time as well as I could perform it myself.
But now considering that I had two mouths to feed in-
stead of one, it was necessary that I must provide more
ground for my harvest, and plant a larger quantity of corn
than I commonly used to do; upon which I marked out a
larger piece of land, fencing it in, in the same manner as
I had done before; in the execution of which I must give
Friday this good word, that no man could work more hardy,
or with better will thanlie did; and when I made him sen-
sible that it was for bread to serve him as well as me, he
then very passionately made me understand, that he thought
1 had much more labour on his account, than 1 had for my-
self; and that no pains or diligence should be wanting in
him, if I would but direct him in those works wherein he
might proceed.
I must certainly own, that this was the most pleasant year
I ever had in the island; for alter some time, Friday began
to talk pretty well, and understood the names of those things
which I was wont to call for, and the places where I used
to send him. So that my long silent tongue, which had been
uselefs so many years, except in an exclamatory manner,
cither for deliverance or blelsingn, now began to bu occu-
ried in teaching, and talking to my man Friday; for indeed
had such a singular satisfaction in the fellow himself, so
innocent did his simple and unfeigned honesty appear more
and more to me every day, that I really began entirely to
; and for his part, I believe there was no love lost, and that his nature had been more charmed by his exceed-
ing kindness, and his affections more placed upon me, than
any other object whatsoever among his own countrymen.
I once had a great mind to try if he had any hankering in-
clination to his own country again; and by this time having
learned the English so well, that he could give me tolerable
answers to any question which I demanded; I asked him
whether that nation to which he belonged, ever conquered
in battle? the question made Friday to smile, and to which
he answered, "Yes, yes, we alwa)s fight the better;" as
much as to say they always got the better in fight. Upon
which we proceeded on the following discourse: You say,
said I, that you always fight the better; why, then, Friday,
how came you to be taken prisoner?
Friday. But for all that, my nation beat much.
Master, How say you, beat? if jour nation beat them, how came you to be taken prisoner.
Friday. They more many mans than my nation in the
place where me was; they take one, two, three, and me:
my nation much over beat them in the yonder place where
me no was, there my nation mans beat one, two, three great
tousand.
Master. Then why did not your nation recover you from
the hands of jour enemies?
Friday. Thiy run one, two, or three, and me: they make
all go in the canoe; my nation have no canoe that time.
Master, 'Tis very well, Friday; but what does your
nation do with the prisoners they take: Do they carry them
away and eat them, as these have done?
Friday. Yes, yes, my nation eats mans too, eat up all.
Alaster. To what place do they carry them to be devoured?
Ft'iiay. Go to other nations where they think.
Master Do they bring them hither?
Frit/ay. Yes come over hither, come over other place.
Matter. And have you been with them here, Friday?
Friday. Yes, me been here (pointing to tite KOI th--xest of the
island, being the side iu/tae tliey used to tand).
Thus having gotten what account I could from my man,
I plainly understood, that he had been as bad as any of the
rest of the cannibals, having been formerly among the sa-
vages who used to come on shore on the farthest part of the
island, upon the same bloody occasion as he was brought
hither for; and sosie time after I carried him to that'
where he pointed; and no sooner did he come there, but
he presently knew the ground, signifying to me that he was
once there when they ate up twenty men, two women, and
a young child: but as he could not explain the number in
English, he did it by so many stones in a row, making a
sign for me to count them.
This pafsage I had the rather mentioned, because it led
to things more important and useful for me to know; for
after i had the satisfactory discourse with him, my next
question was, how far it was from the island to the shore,
and whetherthe canoes were not often lost in the ocean?
to which he answered there was no danger; that no canoes
were ever lost; but, that after a little way out to the sea,
there was a strong current, and a wind always one way in
the afternoon. This I thought at first to be no more than
the sets of the tide, of going out or coming in; but I after-
wards understood it was occasioned by the great draught
and reflux of the mighty river Oroonoko, in the mouth or
gulf of which I imagined my kingdom lay; and that the
land which I perceived to the W. or N. W. must be the
great island Trinidad, on the north of the river. A thou-
sand questions (if that would satisfy me) did I ask Friday,
about the nature of the country, the sea, the coasts, the in-
habitants, and what nations were nearest them; to which
questions the poor fellow declared all he knew, with the
greatest openness, and utmost sincerity. When I demand-
ed of him the particular names of the various nations of his
sort of people, he could only answer me in general, that
they were called Carribce. Hence it was 1 considered that
these must be the Carribees, so much taken notice of by
our maps, to be on that part of America, which reaches
from the mouth of the river Oroonoko to Guiana, and so
on to St. Martha. Then Friday proceeded to tell me, that
up a great way beyond the moon, as much as to say, be-
yond the setting of the moon, which must be W. from their
country, there dwelt white-bearded men, such as I was,
pointing to my whiskers, and that they kill much mans. I
was not ignorant with what barbarity the Spaniards treated
these creatures; so that 1 presently concluded it must be
them, whose cruelties had spread throughout America, to
be remembered even to succeeding generations.
Well,iyou may be sure, this knowledge, which the im-
perfect .knowledge of my man had led me to, was very comfortable to me, and made me so curious as to ask him
how I might depart from this island, and get amongst those
white men? he told me, "Yes, yes, I might go in two
canoes." In two canoes, thought I, what does my man
mean? surely he means one for himself, and another tor me;
and if not, how must two canoes hold me without being
joined, or one part of my body being put in one, and ano-
ther in another? and indeed it was a long time before I
understood his meaning, which was, that it must be a large
boat as big as two canoes, able to bear with the waves, and
not so liable to be overwhelmed as a small one must be.
I believe there is no state of life but what may be happy,
if people would but endeavour for their part to make it so.
He is not the happiest man that has the most riches; but he
that is content with what he has. Before I had my ser-
vant, I thought myself miserable till I had him; and now that
I had enjoyed the happy benefits of him, I still complained,
and begged a deliverance from a place of retirement, ease,
and plenty, where Providence had sufficiently blefsed me.
In a word, from this time I entertained some hopes, that
one time or other I might find an opportunity to make my escape from this island, and that this poor savage might be
a great furtherance thereto.
All the time since my man became so intelligent as to un-
derstand and speak to me, I spared no pains nor diligence
to instruct him, according to my poor share of knowledge,
in the principals of religion, and the adoration that he ought
to pay to the True God. Onetime, as I very well remem-
ber, I asked him'who made him? At first the innocent
creaturedid not understand what I meant, but rather thought
I asked him who was his father? upon which I took ano-
ther way to make him sensible, by demanding from him an
answerto this question. Friday, said I, who is it that made
the sea, this ground whereon we walk, and all these hills
and woods which we behold? and here, indeed, I did not
miss my intention; for he told me it was Old Benamuckee
(the God whom I suppose these savages adored) who lived
a great way beyond all. But as to his attributes, poor Fri-
day was an utter stranger. He could describe nothing of
this great person; and all that he could say was, that he
was very old, much older than the sea.and land, the moon,
or the stars. Friday, said I again, if this great and old per-
son has made all things in the world, how comes it t*f
3
thai all things, as you in particular, do not adore and wor-
ship him? upon this, looking verv grave, with a perfect
sweet look of innocence, he repled, "Master, all things say
O to him," by which it may be reasonably supposed he
meant adoration. And where, said I, do the people of your
country go when they die? He answered to Benamuckee.
What, and those people that are eaten up, do they go there?
"Benamucki't!," said he, "love 'em dearly; me pray to
"Senamuekce in de canoe, and BenaiKUckce would love me
when dey eat me all up." Such discourses as these had I with my man, and sucli
made me sensible, that the true God is worshipped, though
under imperfect similitudes.; aixi that the fatse adoration
which the Heathens give to their imaginary Deity, is as
great an argument of the divine essence, as the most learned
Athiests (falsely jo called) can bring against it; for God
will be gtorified in his works, let their denomination be what it will; and I cannot be of that opinion which some
conceive, that God should decree men to be damned for
want of a right notion of faith, in a place where the wisdom
of the Almighty has not permitted it to be preached; and
therefore cannot but conclude, that, since obedience is the
best sacrifice, these poor creatures, acting by that light and
knowledge which they are polsefsed of, rnay, undoubtedly,
obtain a happy salvation, though not that enjoyment with
Christ, as his saints, confefsors, and martyrs must enjoy.
But laying these determinations aside, more fit for divines
than me to discut.-:, 1 began to instruct my servant in the
saving knowledge of the true Deity, in which the directions
of God's Holy Spirit assisted me. I lifted up my hands to
Heaven, and pointing thereto, told him, that the great
Maker of Heaven and Earth lived there; that, as his infinite
power fashioned this world out of a confused chaos, and
made it in that beautiful frame which we behold, so he
governs and preserves it by his unbounded knowledge,
sovereign greatness, and peculiar providence; that he was
omnipotent, could do every thing for us, give.ev,ry thmg to
u*, and take every thing away from us; that lie was a re-
warder ana punishtr ofg: od and evil actions; that there was
nothing but what he knew, no thoughts so secret bui. whathe,
couki bring to light: and thus by degrees I opened his c>es,
and desciiljed to hira ihe manner of the creation of the world, the situation of paradise, the transgression of oof
first parents, the wickedness of God's peculiar people, and
the universal sins and abominations of the whole earth. —
When these things were implanted in his mind, I told him,
that as God's justice was equal to his mercy, he resolved to
destroy this world, till his Son Jesus Christ interposed in our
behalf; and, to procure our redemption, obtained leave of
his heavenly Father to come down from Heaven into the
world, where he took human nature upon him, instructed us
in our way to eternal life, and died as a sacrifice for our sins;
that he was now ascended into Heaven, mediating for our
pardon, delivering our petitions and obtaining all those good
benefits which we ask in his name, by humble and hearty
p.rnyers, all which were heard at the throne of Heaven.—As very frequently I used to inculcate things into his mind,Friday one day told me, that if our great God could hear
us beyond the sun, he must surely be a greater God than
their Benamnckee, who lived but a little way off, and yet
could not Ivear them till they ascended the great mountains,
where he dwelt, to speak to him. What, said I, Friday,
did you go thither to speak to him too? he answered,
"No, they never went that were young men, none bat old
men, called their Ocivirkakee," meamng the Indian priests,
*' who went "to sa) O, fso he called saying their prayers)
and they ret. rued back, and told them what Benamuckce
"s^ici." From hence, I.could not but observe how happy
we Christians are, who have God's immediate revelation
for our certain guide; and that our faith is neither misled,
nor our reason imposed upon, by any set of men, such as
these Indian impostors.
But, to clear up this palpable »heat To my man Friday, I
told him, that the pretence of their ancient men going up to
the mountain to say O to their God Benamuckee, was an im-
po'ture, and that their bringing back an answer was all a
sham, it not worse; for that, if there was any suds thing
spoken to them, surely it must proceed from an infernal
spirit. And here I thought it necessary to enter into a long
discourse with him, which I did after this manner.
""Friday, said f, vou must know, that before this world
was made, there was an Almighty power existing, by whose
pow'er nil things were made, and whose Majesty shall have
no end. To be glorified ai.d adored by beings of a heaven-
by nsture, he created angels andarchangels, that is i
spirits resembling himself, to encompafs his throne, eter-
nally singing forth his praise in his most heavenly sounds
and divine harmony. And, among this heavenly choir,
Lucifer bore a great sway, as being then one of the peculiar
favourites of these celestial abodes; but he, contrary to that
duty he owed his heavenly Sovereign, with unbounded
ingratitude to his Divine Creator, not only envied him that
adoration which was his due, but thought to usurp that
throne, which he had neither power to keep, nor title to pre-
tend to. He raised a dissension and civil war in Heaven,
and had a number of angels to take his part. Unbounded
folly! stupendous pride! to hope for victory, and aspire
above his power.ful Creator! the Deity, not fearful of such
an enemy,. vet justly provoked at his rebellion, commissioned his archangel Michael to lead forth the heavenly host,
and give lum battle; the advantage of which was quickly perceived by Satan's being overthrown, and the prince of
the air, Rir so the devil is called, with all his fallen angels,
driven headlong into a dismal pi ice, which is called Hell.
The recital of this truth made my man give the greatest
attention, and he expressed a great satisfaction by his ges-
tures, that God had sent the devil into the deep hole.—
And then I desired him to give great heed to what I had
further to say.
No sooner, proceeded I, was God freed from, and the
Heaven clear of this arch-traitor, but the Father speaks to
the Son and Holy Spirit, who belonged to his essence, and
were equal to him in power and glory, Come let us make man, said he, in out man image, after our on'n likoirfs, Gtn. i. 16,
to have dominion over the creatures of I he work! whicii we
have created. And these he intended should glorify him
in Heaven, according to their obedience in this state of
probation on earth, which was, as it were, to be the school
to train them up for these heavenly mansions. Now, Satan
seeing himself foiled, yet that God had not taken the power
from him as prince of the air, which power Heaven design-
ed he should retain, whereby his creatures might be tried;
in revenge for the disgrace he had received, he tempts
Adam's wile, Eve, to taste of the Uee of knowiedge ofgood
and evil, which God had forbidden. He appears to her in
the shape of a Serpent, then a most beautiful .creature, and
tells her that it was no better than an imposition which God
had put upon her and her husband, not to eat of that fa'u
1 2
LIFE AND ADVENTURES
fruit which he had created; that the taste thereof would
make them immortal like God himself; and consequently
as great and powerful as he. Upon which she not only eat
thereof herself, but made her husband eat also, which brought
them both under the heavenly displeasure.
Here Friday expressed a great concern: "Ah,poor mans!"
cried he, "naughty womans! naughty devil! make God not
love de mans, make mans like devil himself."
Friday, said I, God still loved mankind; and though the
devil tempted human nature so far, he would not suffer him
to have an absolute power over them. I have told you be-
fore of his tender love to his people, till they, like Lucifer,
disobeyed his commands and rebelled against him; and
even then, how Jesus Christ, his only Son, came to save
sinners. But still every man that lives in the world is un-
der temptation and trial. The Devil has yet a power, as
prince of the air, to suggest evil cogitations in our minds,
and prompt us on to wicked actions, that he might glory in
our destruction. Whatever evil thoughts we have, proceed
from him; so that God, in this our distress expects we
should apply ourselves to him by fervent prayer for speedy
redress. He is not like Benamuckee, to let none come near
him but Cirwakakee, but suffers the people, as well as priests,
to offer themselves at his feet, thereby to be delivered from
the power and temptation of the devil.
But though at first my man Friday exprefsed some con-
cern atthe wickedness of Lucifer, I found it not so easy to
imprint the right notions of him in his mind, as it was about
the divine essence of God; for there nature assisted me in
all my arguments, to show to him plainly the necefsity ol a
Great First Cause, an over-ruling, governing power; of a
secret directing Providence, anit ot the equity aml reason—
abienels ol pay ing adoration to our Creator; whereas there
appeared nothing of all this in the notion of an evil spirit,
of his first beginning, his nature, and, above all, of his in-
clination to evil actions, and his power to tempt us to the
like. And indeed this ^inlearned Indian, by the mere force
of nature, puzzled me with one particular question, more
than ever I could have expected.
1 hait, it seems, one day, been talking to him of the om-
nipotent power of God, and his infip.ite abhorrence of sin,
insomuch that the Scriptures styled him a consu.fiing fire to
all the workers of iniquity; and that it was in his power, whenever he pleased, to destroy all the world in a moment,
the greater part of which are continually offending him.
When, with a serious attention, he had listened a great
while to what I said, after I had been telling him how the
devil was God's enemy in the hearts of men, and used all
his malice and skill to defeat the good designs of Providence,
and destroy the kingdom of Christ in the world, and so
forth: "Very well, Master," said Friday, "you say God is
"so strong, so great, is he not much strong, much mightier
than the naughty devil?"To be sure, Friday, said I, God
is more wise and stronger than the serpent: he is above the
devil, which makes uspray to him, that he would tread down Satan under his feet, enable us to resist the violent tempta-
tio'ns, and quench his fiery darts. "Why then," answered
Friday quickly, " if God, as you say, has much strong, much
might as the devil, why God no kill devil, make DO more
tempt, no more do wicked."
You may be certain I wasstrangely surprised at the ques-
tion of mv man's: and, though an old man, I was but a
young doctor, and consequently very ill qualified for a ca-
saist, or a resolver of intricate doubts in religion; and as it
required some time for me to study for an answer. 1 pre-
tended not to hear him, nor to ask him what he said; but,
so earnest was he for an answer, as not to forget his question, which he repeated in the very same broken words as above. When I had recovered myself a little ; Friday, said I, God
will at last punish him severely, being reserved for judg-
ment, and is to be cast into the bottomless pit, to remain in
fire everlasting. But all this did not satisfy Friday; for
returning upon me, he repeated my words," KESERVE AT
"LAST, me no understand; but, why not kill devil now,
not k ill devil great, great while ago I" Friday, said I, you
may as well ask me why God does not kill jou and me,
when, by our wicked actions, we so much offend his divine
Majesty? he gives us time to repent of our sins, that there-
by we may obtain pardon. At these words obtain pardon, Friday mused a great while; and, at last, looking me sted-
fastly in the face, " Well, w«ll, "said he,"that's very well;
"so you, I, devil, all wicked mans, all preserve, repent,
God pardon all.
Indeed, here I was run down to the last extremity, when
it became very evident to me, how mere natural notions 1 3
will guide reasonable creatures to the knowledgeof a Deity, and to the homage due to the Supreme Being of God; but
however, nothing but divine revelation can form the know-
ledge of Jesus Christ, and of a redemption purchased for
us, of the mediator of the new covenant, and of an inter-
cessor at the footstool of God's throne; and, therefore, the
Gospel of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ; that is, the
word and spirit of God, promised for the guide and sancti-
fier of his people, are his most necessarv instructors of the
souls of men, in the saving knowledge of the Almighty, and
the means to attain eternal happiness.
And now I found it necessary to put an end to this dis-
course between my man and me: for which purpose I rose
up hastily, and made as if I had some occasion to go out,
sending Friday for something that was a good way off. I
then fell on my knees, and beseeched God that he would
inspire me so far as to guide this poor savage in the know-
ledge of Christ, to answer his questions more clearly, that
his conscience might be convinced, his eyes opened, and
liis soul saved. When he returned again, I entered into a
very long discourse with him, upon the subject of the world's
redemption by the Saviour of it, and the doctrine ofrepent-
nnce preached from Heaven, together with an holy faith
of our blessed Redeemer Jesus Christ; and then I proceed-
ed to explain to him, according to my weak capacity, the
reason why our Saviour took not on him the nature of angels,
but rather the seed of Abraham: and how the fallen angels
had no benefit by that redemption: and, lastly, that h« came
only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel, and the like.—
GoJ knows 1 h•in m.ire sincerity than knowledge in all the
ways I took for the poor Indian's instruction; and I must
acknowledge what I believe every body that acts upon the
same principle will find, that in laying heavenly truths open
before him, I informed and instructed myself in many things
that either I did not know, or had not perfectly considered
.before ; so that, however this poor creature might be im-
proved by my instructions, certain it is, that I myself had
great reason to be thankful to Providence for sending him
to me. His company allayed my grief, and made ray ha-
bitation comfortable; and when I reflected that the sotitary
lite to which I had been so long confined, had made me to look further towards Heaven, by making me the instrument.
Providence, to save the life, am), for pught I know*
the soul of this poor savage, by bringing him to the know-
ledge of Jesus Christ, it caused a secret joy to spread through
every part of my soul; and I frequently rejoiced, that ever
I was brought to this place, which I once thought the most
miserable part of the world.
In this thankful frame of mind did I afterwards continue,
while I abode on the island, and for three years did my
man and I live in the greatest enjoyment of happiness. In-
deed, I believe the savage was as good a Christian as I;
and I hope we were equally penitent; and such penitents
as were comforted and restored by God's Holy Spirit; for
now we had the word of the Lord to instruct us in the right
way, as much as if we had been on the English shore.
By the constant application I made to the Scriptures, as
I read them to my man Friday, I earnestly endeavoured to
make him understand every part of it, as much as lay in my
power. He also, on the other hand, by his very serious
questions and inquiries, made me a much better proficient
in Scripture knowledge, than I should have been by my
own private reading and study. I must not omit another
thing, proceeding from the experience I had in my retire-
ment : It was that infinite and inexpressible blessing, the
knowledge of God through Jesus Christ, which was so plain
and easy to be understood, as immediately to direct me to
carry on the great work of sincere repentance for mv sins,
and laying hold of a Saviour for eternal life, to a practical
stated reformation, and obedience to all God's institutions,
without the assistance of a reverend and orthodox divine;
and especially by this same instruction, so to enlighten this
savage creature, as to make him so good a Christian, as very
lew could exceed him. And there was only this great thing
wanting, that I had no authority to administer the Holy Sa-
crament, that heavenly participation of Christ's body and
blood; yet, however, we rested ourselves content, that God
would accept our desires, and according to our faith, have
mercy on us. But what we wanted one way, was made up in another,
and that was universal peace in our little church. We had
no disputes and wranglings about the nature and equality of
the holy, blessed, and undivided Trinity; no niceties in
doctrine, or schemes of church government; no sour or
morose dissenters to impose more sublimated notions upon
us; no pedant sophisters to confound us with unintelligible mysteries: but instead of all this, we enjoyed the most cer-
tain guide to Heaven; that is, the word of God: besides
which, we had the comfortable views of his Spirit leading
us to the truth, and making us both willing and obedient to
the instruction of his word. As the knowledge and prac-
tice of this are the principal meansof salvation, 1 cannot see
what avails any Christian church, or man in the world,
to amuse himself with speculations and opinions, except it
be to display their particular vanity and affectation.
You may well suppose, that, by the frequent discourse we
had together, my man and I became most intimately ac-
quainted, and that there was but very little that I could say
but what Friday understood; and, indeed, he spoke very
fluently, though it was but broken English. I now took a
particular pleasure in relating all my adventures, especially
those that occurred since my being cast on this island. I
made him understand that wonderful mystery, as he con-
ceived, of gunpowder and bullet, and taught him how to
shoot. I also presented to him a knife, which pleased him exceedingly, making him a belt, with a frog hanging there-
to, like those in which we wear hangers in England; and,
instead of a hanger to put in the frog, I gave him a hatchet,
which was not only as good, but even a better weapon upon
many occasions. In a word, my man thus accoutred, look-
ed upon himself as great as Don Quixote, when that cele-
brated champion went to combat the windmill.
I next gave him a very particular description of the ter-
ritories of Europe, and in a particular manner of Old Eng-
land, the place of my nativity. I laid before him the man-
ner of our worshipping God, our behaviour one to another,
and how we trade in ships to every part of the universe.—
1 then told him my misfortunes in being shipwrecked, show-
ing, as near as I could, the place where the ship lay, which
had been gone long before; and I brought him to the ruins
of my boat, which before my whole strength could not move,
but now was almost rotten, and fallen to pieces. I observed
my man Friday to view this boat with an uncommon cu-
riosity; which, when he had done, he stood pondering a
great while, and said nothing. At last, said I, Friday, what
makes you ponder so much? he replied, "O master, me
see like boat come to place at my nation."
. It was some time, indeed, before I understood what my
man meant; but examining strictly into it, I plainly found, that such another boat resembling mine, had come upon the
country where he dwelt; that is to say, by his fart her explana-
tion, that the boat was driven therethrough stress of weather.
It then came into my mind that some European ship having
been cast away, the poor distressed creatures were forced
to have recourse to the boat to save their lives; and being
all, as I thought, drowned, I never concerned myself to ask
any thing concerning them, but my only inquiry was about
the boat, and what description my man could give of it.
Indeed, Friday answered my demands very well, making
every thing very plain to my understanding; but beyond
measure was I satisfied, when he told me with great warmth
and ardour, "O master, we save white mans from drown;"
upon which J immediately asked him, if there were any
white mans, as he called them, in the boat?" Yes, yes,"
said he, "the boat full, very full of white mans." How
many, Friday .' said I. Hereupon he numbered his fingers,
and counted seventeen. And when I asked him what be-
came of them all, and whether they lived or not? he replied,
"Yrs, master, they all ltve, thev be live among my nation."
This information put fresh thoughts into my head, that these
must be those very men who before I concluded had been
swallowed up in the ocean, after they had left the ship, that
had struck upon the rocks of my kingdom, and after escap-
ing the fury of the deep, landed upon the wild shore, and
committed themselves to the fury of the devouring Indians.
The manner of their cruelties to one another, which con-
sequently, asl thought, must be acted with greater barbarity
to strangers, created in me a great anxiety, and made me
still more curious to ask Friday concermng ihom. He told
me, he was sure they still lived there, having resided among
them above four years, and that the savages gave them vic-
tuals to live upon : But pray, Friday, said I, whence pro-
ceeded all this good-nature and generosity? how came it
to pass that they did not kill and eat them, to please their
devouring appetites, and occasion so splendid an entertain-
ment among \hc.m } " No, no," said Friday, " they not kill
'cm, thi.y m^ke brothers with 'em;" by which I understood
there was a truce between them. And then I had a more
favourable opinion of the Indians, upon Friday uttering
these words: " Aly nation, t'other nation no eat mans, but
when mans make war fight :-" as though he had said, that
neither those of his kingdom, nor any other nations that he
Vnew of, ever ate their fellow-creatures, but such as the'»
1aw of arms allowed to be devoured; that is, those miser-
able captives, whose misfortune it should be to be made pri-
soners of war. Some considerable time after, upon a very pleasant day,
in mast sere.ne weather, my man and I stood upon the top
of a hill, on the east side of the island, whence I had once
before beheld the continent of America. I could not tell
immediately what was the matter; for suddenly Friday fella jumping and dancing as if he had been mad; and upon
my demanding the reason of his behaviour, "O joy," said
he, "O glad! there see my country, there my nation, there
live white snans gether." And indeed such a rapturous
sense of pleasure appeared in his countenance, that his eyes
had an uncommon sparkling and brightness, and such a
strange eagerness, as if he had a longing desire tobe in his
country again. This made me not so well satisfied with
my man Friday as before; for by this appearance, I made
no dispute, but that if he could get back thither again, he
would not only be unmindful of what religion I had taught
him, but likewise of the great obligation he owed me for
his w.onderful deliverance; nay, that he would not only in-
form his countrymen of me, butaccompany hundreds of them
to my kingdom, and make me a miserable sacrifice, like
those unhappy wretches taken in battle.
Indeed I was very much to blame to have those cruel and
unjust suspicions, and must freely own I wronged the poor
creature very much, who was of a quite contrary temper.
And had he had that discerning acuteness which many Eu-
ropeans have, he would certainly have perceived my cold-
ness and indifference, and also have been very much con-
cerned upon that account ,' as 1 was now more circumspect,
I had much lessened my kindness and familiarity with him,
and while this jealousy continued, I used that artful way
(now too much m fashion, the occasion of strife and disseu-
tion) of pumping him daily, thereby to discover whether he
was deceitful in his thoughts and inclinations; but certainly
he had nothing in him but what was consistent with the best
principles, both as a religious Christian and agrateful friend;
and, indeed, I found every thing he said was ingenuous and
innocent, that I had no room for suspicion, and, in spite: «|$}
all uneasiness, he not only made me entirely his
but also caused me much to lament that I ever
one ill thought of him.
As we were walking up the same hill another day, when
the weather was so hazy at sea, that I could not perceive
the continent, Friday, s.aid f, don't you wish yourself to b&
in your own country, your nation, among your old friends
and acquaintances?" Yes," said he, "me much O glad to
"be at my own nation." "And what would you do there,
Friday? would you turn wild again, eat man's flesh, and
be as savage as you were formerly? " No, no," (answered
he, full of concern, and shaking his head) " Friday now tell
"them to live good, tell them pray God, tell them to eat
"corn, bread, cattle, flesh, mitk, no eat man again." But
surely, replied I, if you should offer to do all this, they will kill'
jou; and to manifest their contempt ot such instruction eat
you up when they had done. He then put on a grave,
yet innocent and smooth countenance, saying, "No, they
no kill me, they willing love learn:" that is, that they
would be very willing to learn: adding withal, "that they
had learned much of the bearded mans that came in the
boat." Will you, said I, go back again, Friday? he smiled at that, and told me, that he could not swim so far.
Buf, said f, 1 will make a canoe for you. "Yes, master,"
said he, "me go if you go, me no go if you stay." I go,
Friday! why would you have them to eat me up, and de-
vonr your kind master ?" No, no," said he,"me make
"them not eat master, and me make them much love you;"
that is, he would tell them how I had slain his enemies, and
thereby saved his life, for.wliich reason he would make them
love me: and then he related to me, as well as he was able,
how exceedingly kind those of his nation were to the white,
or bearded, men, as he called them, who, in their great cala-
mity, were driven into their country.
It was from this time, indeed, I had strong inclinations to
venture over, and use my utmost efforts, if possible, to join
these white bearded men, who undoubtedly were Spaniards
or Portuguese; for, thought I, it must certainly be a better
and safer way to escape when there is a good company, than
for me alone, from an island forty miles offthe shore, and
without any assistance. Some days after, Friday and I be-
ing at work, as usual, at the same time diverting ourselves
with various discourses, I told him I had a boat which I
would bestow upon him, whenever he pleased to retuin to
his own nation; and to convince him of the truth of what I
said, I took him with me to the other side of iheislaiid, where'
my frigate lay, and then taking it from under tho water, (for
I always kept it sunk for fear of a discovery) we went both
into it to see how it would manage such an expedition.
And really never could any be more dextrous in rowing
than my faithful servant, making the boat go as fast again as
I could. Well now, Friday, said I, shall we now go to
your so much admired nation? but instead of meeting with
that heerfulness I expected, he looked very dull and me-
lancholy at my saying so; which indeed at first surprised
me, till he made me sensible, that his concern was about
the boat being too small to go so far a voyage. Upon
which I let him understand 1 hid a much bigger; and, ac-
cordingly, the next day went to the place were the first
boat lay, which I had made, when all the strength I had, or
art I could use, failed me in my attempt to get it into the
water: but now it having lain in the sun two and twenty
years, and no care being taken of it all that while, it became
in a manner rotten. My man told me, that such a boat
would do very well for the purpose, sufficient to carry
enough vittle, dtink, bread, for that was his manner of talking.
In short, my mind being strongly fixed upon my designs of
going over with him to the Continent, 1 very plainly told
him that we would both go and make a boat full as big, and
more proportionable than that, wherein he might safely re-
turn to his own nation. These words made Friday look so icry pensive, that I
thought he would have fallen at my feet. It was some time
before he could speak a word, which made me ask him what
was the matter with him? He- replied, in a very soft and
moving tone, "What has poor Friday done? why are you
angry, mad with poor servant? what me done, O what
me done? " Friday, said I, you never yet have offended
me, what makes you think I am angry with you, when I am
not angry at all. "You no angry, no angry," said he, several
times; " it you be no angry, why den send Friday over
great water to my own nation?" Why, surely, Friday, an-
swered I, did not you wish to be there, when from a moun-
tain you beheld the place where you was born? and is it
not to satisfy your desires that I am willing to give you
leave to return thither? "Yes, yes," said Friday, "me wish
." to be there sure enough, but then me wish master there
too : no wish Friday there, no master there." In short, he could not endure the thoughts of going there without i
•
I go there! Friday, said I, what shall I do there? he an-
swered very quickly, "O master, you do great deal much
good, you teach all de wild mans to be good tame mans:
you learn dem to be sober, life good live, to know God,
"and pray God." Alas! poor Friday, said I, what can I
do against their priests of Benamuckee, or indeed what
good can 1 make your nation sensible of, when I my self ant
but a poor ignorant man ?" No, no, master," said he, "you
be no ignorant, you teachee "me good, you teachee derm
"good." You shall go without me, Friday, said I, for I don't care to accompany you thither; I would rather live
in this solitude than venture among such inhuman savages. Go your way since you desire it, and leave me alone by
myself, as I was, before I saved your life.
Never was any creature more thunderstruck than Friday
was at these words. "Go me away, leave master away,"
said he, after a long silence, " no, no, Friday die, Friday live
not master gone," as though he had said, I neither can nor will live, if my master sends me from him. And here I
cannot but take notice of the strong ties of friendship, which
many times surpass those of consanguinity: For often w»
find a great disagreement among kindred; and when there is any seeming regard for each other, it is very seldom true,
and scarce ever lasting, if powerful interest does not bear
the sway; and that alone is often the occasion of the great-
est hatred in the world, which is to desire the death of
parents and relations, for the sake of acquiring their fortunes.
But there was no such thing between my servant and me;
instead of which there was the greatest gratitude and the most sincere love; he found me not only his deliverer, but
his preserver and comforter; not a severe and cruel tyrant,
but a kind, loving, and affable friend. He wanted for no
manner of sustenance; and when he was ill or out of order,
I was his physician, not only for his body but his soul: and
therefore no wonder was it, that such an innocent creature, long since divested of his former natural cruelty, should have an uncommon concern at so cruel a separation from me,
which pierced him to the very soul, and made him desire
even to die, rather than live without me.
After I had told Friday, in a very careless manner, that
lie should be at his liberty as soon as the boat was made, the language of his eyes expressed all imaginable confusion;
Mrhtn, immediately running xoonu of his hatchets, which he &' K
used to wear as a defensive weapon, he gives it into my hand, with a heart so lull, that he could scarcely speak.—Friday, said I, what is it you mean? what must I do with
this? ''Only kill Friday," said he, "Friday care not live
long." But what must I kill you for? replied I again.
"Ah! dear master, what made you Friday save from eat a
me up, so keep long Friday, make Friday love God, and
love not Benamuckee, and now Friday send away; never
see Friday more." As though the poor creature had said,
Alas! my dearest kind master, how comes it to pass, that
after having ventured your precious life to save me from the
jaws of devouring cannibals, like myself, after such a tender
regard to provide for me such a comfortable nourishment,
and c: ntii.uing so long a kind master, and a most sincere
-fiiend; and after making me forsake the false notion of an
Indian deity, and worship the true God in spirit and in
truth; and after all this, how comes it now, that you are
willing to send me away to my former course of living, by
which means undoubtedly we shall be dead to each other;
but greater must be my misfortune, that I shall never behold
my best friend I have in the world any more. And this un-
doubtedly, though he could not express himself so clearly,
must be his sentiments; for the tears ran down his cheeks
in such a plentiful manner, that I had much ado to refrain from
weeping alsoj when I beheld the poor creature's affection;
so that I was forced to comfort him in the best manner I
could, which I did, by telling him, if he was content to abide
with me, I should be ever willingto keep him.
After Friday's grief was somewhat abated, more fully to
convince me of his affection, he said, "O master, me not
•' care to be in my nation, leave you here; me desire nation
"learn good that's all;" meaning, that his desire was for the
conversion of that barbarous people. But as I had no apos-
tolic mission, nor any concern about their salvation, so I
had not the least intention or desire of undertaking it; and
the strength of my inclination, in order to escape, proceed-
ed chk.tiy i'rom my late discourse with Friday, about these
seventeen white bearded men, that had been driven upon
the Barbarian coast, whom I designed to join as the only
means to further our escape. To which intent my
and I went to search for a proper tree to fell, whereof
imght make a large perigua or canoe, to undertake the
voyage; and, indeed, we were not long in finding one fit tj*
cnr purposei there being enough of wood in the island to
have built a fleet of large vessels; but the thing we princi-
pally wanted, was to get one so near the water, tliat wo
might launch it after it was finished, and not commit so
horrid a mistake as I had done once before.
Well, after a great search for what was best and most
convenient, Friday, at last, whose judgment in such affairs was much superior to mine, pitches upon a kmd oi wood
the most fiting for it. To this day I cannot tell the name
of the tree, nor describe it any other way, than only by say-
ing, that it is very like what we call fustic, or between that and the Niacaragua wood, being much of the same colour
and smell. But though my man exceeded me in my know-
ledge of the most proper tree, yet I showed him a much better and clearer way to make a canoe than ever he knew
before; for he was for burning the hollow or cavity oi tin:
tres, in ord^r t.i make this boat; but I then told him how he
might do it with tools, learning hi:nat the same time how
to use them, which indeed he did very dexterouslv - so that
in a month's tinu we finished it, making it very ha.ii.>'.ma
by cutting the outside in the true shape of a bo it. A ft ^i'
this it took us a full fortnight before we could get her into the water, which we did as it were inch by inch, upon gr-..r.t
rollers; but when she was in, she would have carried twen-
ty men, with all the ease imaginable.
As I was very well pleased, you may be sure, at the launching of this man of war of mine, I was no less amazed
to behold with what dexterity my man would manage her,
turn her, and paddle her along. Well, Friday, said I, what
do you think of it now? Do you think this will carry u.:
over? "Yes, master," said he, "me venture over wolf,
"though great blow wind." But my design wjs jet far-
ther, which he was insensible of; and that was to make a mast and a sail, and to provide her with an anchor and ca-
ble. As to a mast, that was no difficult thing at all to pro-
cure: so I fixed upon a straight young cedar-tree, which I found near the place, great plenty of it abounding in the island; and setting Friday to cut it down, I gave him parti-
cular directions how to shape and order it; but as to the
sail, that I managed myself. I very well knew I had som«
old ones, or pieces of sails enough, which had lain six and
twenty years by me; but not being careful to preserve them,
as thinking I should have no occasion to use them any more, K2
when I came to overlook them, I found them almost all
rotten, except two; and with these I went to work, and
after a great deal of pains and awkward tedious stitching
for want of needles, at length 1 finished a three-cornered
ugly thing, like what we call in England a shoulder of mut-
ton sail, to go with a boom at bottom, and a little small sprit
at the top, like those which our long-boats use, and which
I very well knew how to manage, especially since it was
like that which I had in my patron's fishing-boat, when,
with my boy Xury, I made my escape from the Barbarian
shore.
It was near two^months, I think, before I completed this
work, that is, the rigging and fitting my masts and sails;
and indeed they were nicely done, having made a small stay
and a sail, ora foresail to it, to afsist, if we should turn to
the westward; and, what is still more, I fixed a rudder to
the stern of her, to steer with; and though I was but a very
indifferent shipwright, yet, as I was sensible of the great
nfefulnefs and absolute necessity of a thing like this, I ap-
plied myself to it with such a constant application, that I at
tast accomplished my design; but what with the many dull
contrivances I had about it, and the failure of many things,
it cost me as much pains in ordering as in making the boat.
Besides, when all this was done, I had my man to teach
what belonged to its navigation; for though he very well
understood how to paddle a canoe along, he was an utter
stranger to a sail and a rudder, and was amazed when he
saw me work the boat to and fro in the sea, by them, and
how the sail gibbed and filled this way or that way, as the
course we sailed changed. After some time and a little
use, I made all these things very familiar to him, so that he
became an expert sailor, except in relation to the compass, and that I could make him understand but little of. But as
it happened, there was seldom occasion for it, there being
but little cloudy weather, and scarce any fog in those parts;
the stars were always visible in the night, and the shore
perspicuous by day, except in the rainy season, which con-
fined every one to his habitation. Thus entered in the
seven and twentieth year of my reign, or captivity, which
you please, (the last three of which, blefsed with the com-
pany of my man Friday, ought not to be reckoned) I kept
the anniversary of my landing here, with the same thank.
fulness to God, for his tender mercies, as I did before j and
certainly, as I had great cause for a thankful acknowledg-
ment for my deliverance at first, I had much greater now
for such singular and additional testimonies of the care of
Providence over me, in all my distresses of both body and
mind, and the great hopes I had of being effectually and
speedily delivered; for I had a strong impression upon my
mind, that I should not be another year in this island. But,
however, I still continued on with my husbandry, digging, planting, and fencing, as usual; gathering and curing my
grapes, and doing all other things that were necessary.
And now the rainy season beginning to come on, obliged
me to keep thelonger within doors; but before this, I brought
my new vessel into the creek, where I had landed my rafts
from the ship, and haling her up to the shore, I ordered my
man Friday to dig a dock sufficient to hold her in, and deep enough to give her water, wherein slit; might float; and
when the tide was out, we made a strong dam acrof*
the end of it, to keep out the water; by which means she
lay dry, as to the tide, from the sea; and to keep the rain
from her, we thatched her over, as it were, with boughs of
trees, like a house, so we waited for the months of Novem-
ber and December, in which I designed to venture over the
ocean.
Xo sooner did the seasonable weather begin to draw
near, but so. much was I elevated with this new designed
adventure, "that 1 daily prepared for the voyage. The first
thing I thought on was, to lay by a certain quantity of pro-
.visions, as a sufficient store for such an expedition, intend-
ing in a week or fortnight's time to open the dock, and to
launch out the boat for that purpose. But one morning as I
was very busy upon something necefsary for this occasion,
I called Friday to me, and bid him go to the sea shore, and
see if he could find u turtle or tortoise, a thing which we
commonly had once a week, as much upon account of the eggs, as for the sake of the flesh. He had not been long gone, before he came running back, as though he was pursued
for life, and as it were flciv ovcr my outer wall, or fence,
like one that felt not the ground,or had steps to set his ftct on,
and before I had time to inquire the reasen of his precipi-
tation, he cries out, '' Q dear MasU'r, O sorrow,. sorrow!
"Bad! O bad!" Why what's the matter, Friday, said I. "O yonder, yonder!" said he, " there be one, two, or three.
"seaaoes! two three!'" Surely, thought I, there must ha;

K3
six, by ray man's way of reckoning; but on a stricter
inquiry, 1 found there were but three. Well, Friday, said I,
don't be terrified, I warrant you we will not only defend
ourselves against them, but kill the most of these cruel sa-
vages. But though I comforted him in the best manner I
could, the poor creature trembled so, that I scarce knew
what to do with him : " O master," said he," they comelook
"Friday, cut pieces Friday, cut a me up." Why, Friday,
said I, they will eat me up as well as you, and my danger is
us great as yours. But since it is so, we must resolve to
fight for our lives. What say you? Can you fight, Friday?
"Yes," said he, very faintly, "me shoot, me kill what I
"can, but there come a great many number." That's no
matter, said I again, our guns will terrify those we do not
kill; I am very willing to stand by you to the last drop of
my blood. Now tell me if you will do the like by me, and
obey my orders in whatsoever 1 command? Friday then
answered, "O master me lose life for )ou, me die when
"you bid die." Thus concluding all questions concerning
bis fidelity, immediately 1 fetched him a good dram of rum,
(of• which I had been a very good husband) and gave it him
to comfort his heart. After he had drank it, I ordered him
to take the two fowling-pieces, which we always carried,.
and load them with large swan shot, as big as small pistol
bullets; then I took four muskets, and loaded them with
two slugs; and five small bullets each, charging my two
pistols each with a brace; I hung my great sword, as cus-
tomary, naked to my side, and gave Friday his hatchet, as a
most excellent weapon for defence.
Thus prepared, I thought as well of myself as any knight-
errant that ever handled a sword and spear. 1 took my per-
spective glafs, and went up to the side of the hill, to see
what I could discover; and I perceived very soon, by my
glafs,that there were eneand twentysavages, three prisoners,
and three canoes, and that their chief concern seemed to
be the triumphant banquet upon the three poor human
bodies, a thing which by this time I had observed was very
common with them. I also remarked, that they did not
land at that place from whence Friday made his escape, but
rearer to the creek, where the shore was low, and where a
thick wood came very close to the sea. My soul was then
filled with indignation and abhorrence at such inhuman
wretches, which put a period to all my former thought* 'id
their vindication, neither would 1 give myself timn to con*
sider their right of.conquest, as I had done before: but de-
scending from the mountain, I came down to Friday, and
told him I was resolved to go speedily to them, and kill
them all; asking him again, in the same breath, if he would
stand by me: when by this time being recovered from his
fright, and his spirits much cheered with the dram I had
given him, he was very pleasant, yet seriously telling me,
as he did before, " When I bid die, "he would die."
And now it was, having fixed my resolution in so strong
si manner, that nothing could divest my breast of its uncom-
mon fury, I immediately divided the loaded arms betwixt
us. To my man Friday I gave a pistol to stick in his gir-
dle, with three guns upon his shoulder, a weight too great,
I confess, to bear; but what must a poor king do, who had
but one soldier in the world? but to show I made him bear
no more than what I would lay on myself, I stuck the other
pistol in my girdle, and the other three guns upon my
shoulders; nay, something more, but that was like ./Esop's
burden, a small bottle of rum, which was soon lightened to
our exceeding refreshment. Thus we marched out, under
a ponderous load of armour, like two invincible champions,
with a quantity of powder and bullets to stand our battle,
and load again when the pieces were discharged. And
now my orders being to be obeyed, I charged Friday to keep close behind me, and not to stir, or shoot, or attempt
any thing till I commanded him; and in the interim, not to
speak so much as one word. It was in this order I fetched
a compass to the right hand, of near a mile, as well to get
over the creek, as to attain the wood; and by this I thought
to come within shot of them before I could be discerned, as
I found, by my glass, would not be difficult to accomplish.
But how fickle and wavering is the mind of men, even in
our greatest fury and strongest inclinations f For while I was taking this march, my resolution began to abate, not
through fear of their numbers, who were a parcel of naked
unarmed wretches, but iihose reflections occured to my
thoughts: what powerwas I commissioned with, or what
occasion or necessity had I to go and imbrue my hands in
human blood, and mmrder people that had neither done nor
intended to do me any wrong? they were innocent in
particular as to me; and their barbarous custom was not
only their misfortune, but a sign that God had left them in
the most immense stupidity; but yet did not warrant me to be a judge of their actions, much less an executioner of hi*
righteous judgments: That on the contrary, whenever he
thought fit, he would take vengeance on them himself, and
punish them in a national way, according to their national
crimes; but this was nothing at all to me, who had no con-
cern with them. Indeed my man Friday might justify him-
self, because they were his declared enemies, of that very
same nation that went to sacrifice him before; and, indeed,
it was lawful for him to attack them, which I could not say
was so with respect to me. So warmly did these things press
upon my thoughts all the wav I went, that I only resolved
to place myself so as to behold their bloody entertainment
without falling upon them, except something more than or-
dinary, by God's special direction, should oblige me. thereto.
Thus fixed in my resolution, I entered into the thick wood,
(my man Friday following me close behind) when with all
possible wariness and silence, [ marched till I came to the
skirt of it, on that side which was the nearest to them; for
only one end of the wood interposed between me and them.
Upon which I called very softly to Friday, and showing him
a great tree, that was just at the corner of the wood, I or-
dered him to repair thither, and bring me word if lie could
plainly perceive their actions; accordingly he did as I com-
manded him, and came back with this melancholy story,
that they were all about their fire, eating the flesh of one of
their prisoners; and that another lay bound upon the sand,
at a little distance from them, which they designed for the
next sacrifice, and this he told me was not one of their na?
tion, but one of those very bearded men, who were driven
by a storm into their country, and of whom he had so often
talked to me about. You may be sure, that upon hearing this,
my soul was ready to sink within me: when, ascending into
a tree, I saw plainly, by my glass, a white man, who lay upon
, tne beach of the sea, with his hands and feet tied with flags,
or things resembling rushes, being covered with clothes,
and seemed to be an European. From the tree where 1 took
this prospect, 1 perceived another tree and a thicket be)Ond
it, about fifty yards nearer to them than where I was, which,
by taking a small.circle round, I might come at undiscovered,
and then I should be within half a shot of these devourers.
And this consideration alone, to be more perfectly revenged
upon them, made me withhold my passion, though I w.as
enraged. to .the highest degr«s imaginable; when goinj
back about twenty paces, I got behind some bushes, which
held all the way till I came to the other tree; and then I
ascended to a little rising ground, not above eighteen yards
distance, and there I had a full view of these creatures, and
I could perceive all their actions.
Such a sight did then appear as obliged me not to lose
a moment's time. No less then nineteen of these dreadful
wretches sat upon the ground, close huddled together, ex-
pressing all the delight imaginable at so barbarous an en-
tertainment; and they had just sent the other two to murder
this poor unhappy Christian, and bring him limb by limb
to their fire; for they were then just going to untie the
bands from his feet, in order for death, as fetters are knock-
ed off the feet of malefic.tors before they go to the place of
execution. Hereupon, immediately turning to my man,
now, Friday, said I, mind what I say, fail in nothing, but
do exactly as you see me do. All which he promising he
would perform, I set down one of my muskets and fowling-piece upon the ground, and Friday did the same by his; and
with the other musket 1 took my aim at the savages, bidding
him do the like: are you ready? said I: " Yes, Master,"
said he; why then fire at them, said I; and that very mo-
ment I gave fire likewise.
I only killed one and wounded two; but my man Friday,
taking his aim much better than I, killed two and wounded
three. You may be sure they were in a dreadful consterna-
tion at such an unexpected disaster, and those who had yet
escaped our penetrating shot, immediately jumped upon
their feet, but were in such a confusion, that they knew not
which way to run or look, not knowing from whence their
destruction came. We threw down our pieces and took up
others, giving a second dreadful volley ; but as they were
loaded only with swan shot, or small pistol bullets, we per-
ceived only two of them fall; though many were wounded,
who tun yelling and screaming about like mad creatures.
Now, Friday, said I, lay down your piece, and take up the
musket, and follow me. He did so, with great courage;
when, showing ourselves to the savages, we gave a great
shout, and made directly to the poor victim, who would
have been sacrificed had not our first fire obliged the butch-
ers, with three others, to jump into a canoe. By my order
Friday fired at them, at which shot I thought he had killed
them all, by reason of their falling to the bottom of the boat;
however, he killed two, and mortally wounded a third. 1»
the mean time, I cut the flags that tied the hands and feet
of tlie poor creature, and lifting him up, asked him in the
Portuguese tongue, What kewas? He'answeredme in Latin,
Christianas: but so very weak and faint, that lie could scarce
stand or speak. Immediately i gave him a dram, and a
piece of bread to cherish him, and askedhim what country-
man he was? He said, Hispaniola, and then uttered all the
thanktulr.ef& imaginable for his deliverance. Signior, said I,
with as much Spanish as I was master of, let us talk after-
wards, but fight now; here take th's sword and pistol, and
do what you can. And, indeed, hn did so with such cou-
rage and intrepidity, that he cut two of them in pieces in
an instant, tite savages not having the power to fly lor their
lives. I ordered Friday to run for ilvt'e pieces we had Itli
at ihe tree, which he brought me with great swiftnefs, and
then I gave him my musket, while 1 loaded the rest. Bat
now thiTe happened a riert;e encounter between the Spani-
ard aud one of the savages who had made at him with one
of their woodsn swords; and though the former was as
hrave as could be expected, having twice wounded his ene-
my in the head, yet beiog weak airi faint, the Indian had
thrown him upon the ground, and was wresting my sword
out ofliis hand, which the Spaniard very wisely quitting,
drew out his pistol, and shot him through the body before I
could come near him, though 1 was running to his afsistance.
As to Friday, he pursued the (lying wretches with his hatch-
et, despatching three, but the rest were too nimble for him.
The Spaniard taking one qf the fowling-pieces, wounded
two, who running into the wood, Friday pursued and killed;
but the other, notwithstanding his wounds, plunged/himself
into the sea, and swam to those who were left in the cauoe,
which, with one wounded, were all that escaped out of on«
and twenty. The account is as follows:

TJie savages in the canoe worked very hard to get out
efour reach, and Friday was as eager in pursuing them;
and indeed I was no less anxious about their escape, lesi,
aiter the news had been carried to their people, they should
return in multitudes, and destroy us. So being resolved to
pursue them, I jumped into one of their canoes, and bid
Friday follow me; but no sooner was I in, than, to my sur-
prise, I found another poor creature bound hand and foot
for the slaughter, just as the Spaniard had been, with very
little life in him. Immediately I unbound him, and would
have helped him up, but he could neither stand nor speak,
but groaned so piteously, as thinking he was only unbound
in order to be slain. Hereupon I bid Friday speak to him,
and tell him of his deliverance; when pulling out my
bottle, I made the poor wretch drink a dram, which, with
the joyful news he had received, so revived his heart, that
he sat up in the boat. As soon as Friday began to hear him
speak, and look more fully in his face, it would have moved
any one to tears to perceive his uncommon transports of
joy; for he kissed, embraced him, hugged him, cried,
laughed, hallooed, jumped about, danced, sung, then cried
again, wrung his hands, beat his face and head, then sung
and jumped about again, like a distracted creature; so that
it was a great while before 1 could make him speak to me
or tell me what was the matter with him; but when he
came to the liberty of his speech, at last he told me it was
his father.
Here indeed I was infinitely moved to see that dutiful
and tender affection this poor savage had to his aged parent.
He would sit down by him in the boat, open his breast, and
hold his father's head close to his bosom, half an hour toge-
ther, to cherish him: then he took his arms and ancles,
which were stiff and numbed, with binding, and chafed and
rubbed them with his hands; by which means perceiving
what the case was, I gave him tome rum, which proved of
great benefit to him.
While we were busy in this. action. the savages had got-
ten almost out of sight; and happy it was we did not pur-
sue them : For there arose from the north-west which con-
tfnued all night 1.mg, such a violent storm, that 1 could not
suppose otherwise but that they were all drowned. After
this I called Friday to me, and asked him if he had given
h'u father anv bread ?- He shoke his head and said,"
"not one bit, me eat a-up all;" so [ gave him a cake of
bread out of a little pouch I carried for this end. I like-
wise gave him a dram for himself, and two or three bunches
of raisins for his father. Both these he carried to him, for
he would make him drink the dram to comfort him.
Away then he runs out of the boat as if he was bewitched,
with such an extraordinary swiftness, that he was out of
sight as it were in an instant; but at his return, I perceived
him slacken his pace, because he had somthing in his hand.
And this I found to be, as he approached nearer, an earthen
jug with some water for his father, with two more cakes of
bread, which he delivered into my hands. Being very
thirsty myself, I drunk some of the water, of which when
his father had drank sufficiently, it more revived his spirits
than all the rum I had given him.
I then called Friday to me, and ordered him to carry the
Spaniard one of the cakes, and some water, who was
reposing himself upon a green place, under the shade of a
tree, but so weak,that though he exerted himself, he could
not stand upon his feet. Upon which I ordered Friday to
rub and bathe his ancles with rum, as he did his father's.—But every minute he was employed in this he would cast a
wishful eye towards the boat, where he left his father sit-
ting; who suddenly disappearing, he flew like lightning
to him, and finding he had only laid himself down to ease
his limbs, he returned back to me presently, and then I
spoke to the Spaniard to let Friday help him, and lead him
to the boat, in order to be conveyed to my dwelling, where
I would take care of him. Upon which Friday took him
upon his back, and so carried him to the canoe, setting him
close by his father; and presently stepping out again,
launched the boat off, and paddled it along the shore faster
than I could walk, though the wind blew very hard too,
and having brought them safe to the creek, away he runs to
fetch the other canoe, which he brought to the creek almost
as soon as I got to it by land, when wafting me over, we took our new guests out of the boat; but so weak were they
that I was forced to make a kind of a hand-barrow; and
when I came to my castle, not being willing to make an
entrance into my wall, we made them a handsome tent,
covered with old sails, and boughs oftrees, making two
good beds of rice straw, with blankets to lie upon and cover
them. Thus, like an absolute king over subjects who owed
6
their lives to me, I thought myself very considerable, espe-
cially as I had now three religions in my kingdom, my man
Friday being a Protestant, his father a Pagan, and the Spa-
niard a Papist: but I gave liberty of conscience to them all.
To get provisions for.my poor weak subjects, I ordered
Friday to kill me a yearling goat; which when he had done,
I cut off the hinder quarters, and chopping it into small
pieces, boiled and stewed it, putting barley and rice into
the broth. This I carried into their tent, set a table, dined
with them myself, and enconragcd them. Friday was my
interpreter to his father, and indeed to the Spaniard too,
who spoke the language of the savages pretty well. After
dinner, I ordered Friday to fetch home all our arms from the
field of battle, and the next day to bury the dead bodies,
which he did accordingly.
And now I made Friday inquire of his father, whether
he thought these savages had escaped the late storm in their
canoe? and if so, whether they would not return with a
power too great for us to resist? he answered, that he
thought it impossible they could outlive the storm; or, if
they were driven southwardly, they would come to a land
where they would be as certainly devoured, as iithey were
drowned in the sea. And suppose they had attained their
own country, the strangeness of their fatal and bloody attack, would make them tell their people, that the rest of
them were killed by thunder and lightning, not by the
hand of man, but by two heavenly spirits, (meaning Friday
and me) who were sent from above to destroy them. And
this, he said, he knew, because he heard them say the same
to one another. And indeed he was in the right on't; for
I have heard since, that these four men gave out that who-
ever went to that enchanted island, would be destroyed by
fire from the gods.
No canoes appearing soon after, as I expected, my ap-
prehensions ceased: Instead of which my former thoughts
of a voyage took place, especially when Friday's father as-
sured me, I should have good usage in his nation. As to
the Spaniard, he told me that sixteen more of his country-
men and Portuguese, who had been shipwrecked, made their escape thither; that though they were in union with
the savages, yet they were very miserable for want of pro-
visions and Bother. necel*aries. Whea I asked him about L
the particulars of his voyage, he answered that their ship
was bound from Rio de la Plata to the Havannah; that
when the ship was lost, only five men perished in the ocean;
the rest, having saved themselves in the boat, were now
landed on the main continent. And what do they intend
to do there? said I. He replied, they have concerted mea-
tures to escape, by building a vessel, but that they had nei-
ther tools nor provisions, so that all their designs came to
nothing. Supposing, said I, I should make a proposal, and
invite them here, would they not carry me prisoner to New
Spain? he answered no; for he knew them to be such ho-
nest men, as would scorn to act such inhuman baseness to
their deliverer: that, if I pleased, he and the old savage
would go over to them, talk with them about it, and bring
me an answer: that they should all swear fidelity to me
as their leader, upon the Holy Sacrament; and, for his part,
he would not only do the same, but stand to the last drop
of his blood, should there be occasion.
These solemn afsurances made me resolve to grant them
relief, and to send these two over for that purpose; but
when everything was ready, the Spaniard raised an objec-
tion, which carried a great deal of weight in it: "You
." know, sir," said he, "that having been some time witb
"you, I cannot but be sensible of your stock of rice and
*' corn, sufficient, perhaps, for us at present, but not for them,
should they come over presently; much less to victual a
"vefsel for an intended voyage. Want might be as great
an occasion for them to disagree and rebel, as the children
of Israel did against God himself, when they wanted
bread in the wildernefs. And, therefore, my advice is,
to wait another harvest, and in the mean time cultivate
and improve soine more land, whereby we may have
plenty of provisions, in order to execute our design."
This advice of the Spaniard's I approved extremely, and
so satisfied was I of his fidelity, that I esteemed him ever
after. And thus we all four went to work upon some more
land, and against seed-time we had gotten so much cured
and trimmed up, as was sufficient to sow twenty-two bushels
of barley on, and sixteen jars of rice, which was, in short,
all the seed we had to spare. As we were four in number,
and by this time all in good health, we feared not a hun-
dred Indians, should they venture to attack us; and while
the corn was growing, I pitched upon some trees, fit t«
127
build us a large vessel, in case the Spaniards came over;
which being marked, I ordered Friday and his father to cut
them down, appointing the Spaniard, who was now my
privy counsellor, to oversee and direct the whole. I like-
wise increased my flocks of goats, by shooting the wild
dams, and bringing home their kids to my inclosure. Nor
did I neglect the grape season, but cured them as usual,
though I had such a quantity now, as would have filled
eighty barrels with raisins. And thus all of us being employed, they in working, and I in providing for them, till
harvest came, God Almighty blessed the increase of it so
much, that from twenty-two barrels of barley, we thrashed
out two hundred and twenty, and the like quantity of rice,
sufficient to victual a ship tit to carry me and all the Spaniards to any part of America.
Thus the principal objection being answered, by a suffi-
cient stock of provisions, I sent my two ambassadors over
to the main land, with a regal authority to administer the
oaths of allegiance and fidelity, and have an instrument
signed under their hands, though I never asked whether
they had pen, ink, or paper; when gWing each of them a musket, eight charges of powder and ball, and provisions
enough for eight days, they sailed away with a fair gale,
on a day when the moon was at full.
Scarce a fortnight had passed over my head, but impa-
tient for their return, I laid me down to sleep one morning,
when a strange accident happened, which was ushered in.
by Friday's coming running to me, and calling aloud,
"Master, master, they are come, they are come." Upon
which, not dreaming of any danger, out I jumped from my
bed, put on my clothes, and hurried through my little grove;
when looking towards the sea, I perceived a boat about a
league and a half distant, standing in for the shore with the
wind fair. I beheld they did not come from the side where
the land lay on, but from the southernmost end of the island:
So these being none of the people we wanted, I ordered
Friday to lie still, till such time as I came down from the
mountain, which with my ladder, I now ascended, in order
to discover more futly what they were; and now with the
help of my perspective glass, I plainly perceived an Eng-
lish ship, which I concluded it to be, by the fashion of its
long boat; and which fHied me with such uncommon trans-
it .-'
ports of joy, fhat I cannot tell how to describe; and yet
some secret doubts hung about me, proceeding from I know
not what cause, as though T had reason to be upon my
guard. And, indeed, I would have no man contemn the
secret hints and intimations of danger, which very often are
given, when we may imagine there is no possibility of its
being real; for had I not been warned by this silent admo-
nition, I had been in a worse situation than before, and
perhaps inevitably ruined.
Not long it was, before I perceived the boat to approach
the shore, as though they looked for a place where they
might conveniently land; and at last they ran their boat on
shore upon the beach, about half a mile's distance; which proved so much the happier for me; since, had they come
into the creek, they had landed just at my door, and might
not only have forced me out of my castle, but plundered
me of all I had in the world. Now I was fully con-
vinced they were all Englishmen, three of which were un-
armed an.d bound; when immediately the first four or fiva
leaped on shore, and took those three out of the boat as
prisoners; one of whom I could perceive used the most
passionate gestures of entreaty, affliction, and despair, while
the others, in a lesser degree, showed abundance of concern.
Not knowing the meaning of this, I was very much as*
stonished, and I beckoned to Friday, who was below, to
ascend the mountain, and likewise to view this sight. "O
"master," said he to me, "you see English mans eat pri-
"soners as well as Savage mans." And do you think they
will eat them, Friday? said I, "Yes," said Friday, " ihey
"eat-a all up." No, no, said I, Friday, I am much more
concerned lest they murder them, but as for eating them
up, that I am sure they will never do.
And now I not only lamented my misfortune in not hav.t
ing the Spaniard and the savage with me, but also that I
could not come within shot of them unperceived, (they hav-
ing no fire arms among them) and save these three men,
whom I thought they were going to kill with their swords.
But some comfort it was to me, that I perceived they were
set at liberty to go where they pleased, the rascally seamen
scattering about as though they had a mind to see the place;
and so long did they negligently ramble, that the tide had
ebbed ^o low as to leave the boat aground. Nor where the
two men who were in her more circumspect; for having
drunk a little too much liquor, they fell fast asleep; but one
of them waking before the other, and perceiving the boat
too fast aground for his strength to move it, he hallooed out
to the rest, who made all pofsible expedition to come to
him; but as Providence ordered it, all their force was in-
effectual to launch her, when I could hear them speak to
one another, "Why let her alone, Jack, can't ye; she'll
float next tide;" by which words I was fully convinced they
were my own countrymen. I all this while lay very quiet,
as being fully sensible it could be no less than ten hours be-
fore the boat could be afloat, and then it would be so dark,
that they could not easily perceiveme, by which means'I
should be at more liberty to hear their talk, and observe all
their motions; not but that I prepared for my defence: yet,
as I had another sort of an enemy to combat with, I acted
with more caution. I took two fusees on my shoulder, and
gave Friday three muskets; besides my formidable goat-
skin coat and monstrous cap made me look as fierce and
terrible as Hercules of old, especially when two pistols were
stuck in my belt, and my naked sword hanging by my side.
It was my design at first not to make any attempt till it
was dark; and it being now two o'clock, in the very heat
of the day, the sailors were all straggling in the woods, and
undoubtedly were lain down to sleep. The three poor dis-
trefsed creatures, too anxious to get any repose, were how-
ever seated under the shade of a great tree, about a quarter
of a mile from me. Upon which, without any more ado, I
approached towards them, with my man following behind
me, and, before I was perceived, I called aloud to them in Spanish, "What are ye, Gentlemen r"
At these words, they started up in great confusion, when
they beheld the strange figure I made; they returned no
answer-, but seemed as if they would fly from me. "Gen-
**men," said I, in English, "don't be afraid; perhaps you
have a friend nearer than you expect." "He must be
from Heaven," said one of them, gravely, pulling off his
hat, "for we are past all help in this world." "All help
'"is from Heaven," said I; "but, Sir, as I have perceived
every action between you and these brutes since your
landing, only inform me how to afstsi you,.and I will do
it to the utmost of my power."
-tears
"Am I talking with God or man," said he, in melting
tears. "Are you of human kiud or auangel?" "Sir/"
*aid I, "my poor habit will tell you I am a man, and an
"Englishman, willing to assist you, having but this servant
"only: here are arms and amunition; tell freelv your
"condition: Can we save you?" "The story," said he,
"is too long to relate, since our butchers arc so near; but
"Sir, I was master of that ship, my men have mutinied,
"and it is a favour they have put my mate, this patsenger,
"and me, on shore without murdering us, though we ex-
"pect nothing but perishing here." "Are your enemies
"gone ?" said I, "No," replied he, pointing to a thicket,
"there they lie, while my heart trembles, lest having seen
and heard us, they should murder us all." "Have they
*' fire arms?" said I. "They have but two pieces," said
he, "one of which is left in the boat." He also told me
there were two enormous villains among them, that were
the authors of this mutiny, who, if they were killed or
seized, might induce the rest to return to their obedience.—
"Well, well," said I, "let us retire farther under the
*' covering of the woods;" and there it was I made these
conditions wilh him.
I. That, while they staid in the island, they should not
pretend to any authority; but should entirely conform to
my orders, and return me the arms which I should put in
iheir hands.
II. That, if the ship was recovered, they should afford
Friday and myself a passage gratis to England.
When he had given me all the satisfaction I could desire,
I gave him and his two companions each of them a gun,
with powder and ball sufficient, advising them to fire upon
them as they lay sleeping. The Captain modestly said, that
he was sorry to kill them j though, on the other hand, to let these villains escape, who were the authors of his misery, might be the ruin of us all. "Well," said he, "do as you
think fit;" and so accordingly, I fired, killed one of the
captain's chief enemies and wounded the other, who eagerly
called for assistance j but the captain who had reserved
his piece, coming up to him, "Sirrnh," said he, "'tis too>
<' late to call for assistance, you should rather cry to God to
pardon your villany;" and so knocked him down with
the stock of his gun; three others were also slightly wound-
ed, who at my approach cried out for help. This the captain granted, upon condition that they would swear to be
true to him in recovering the ship, which they solemnly did}
however I obliged the captain to keep them bound. After
which I sent Friday and the captain's mate to secure the
boat and bring away the oars and sails; when, at their re-
turn, three men coming back, and seeing their late distrefsed
Captain now their conqueror, submitted to be bound also.
And then it was, that having more liberty, I related the ad-
ventures of my whole life, which he heard with a serious
and wonderful attention. After this, I carried him and his
two companions into my little fortified castle; showed them
all my conveniences, and refreshed them with such provi-
sions, as I could afford. When this was over, we began to
consider about regaining the ship. He said that there were
twenty-six hands on board, who knowing their lives were
forfeited by the law for conspiracy and mutiny, were so very
hardened, that it would be dangerous for our small company
to attack them. This was a reasonable inference indeed;
but something we must resolve on, and immediately put in
execution. We therefore heaved the boat upon the beach
so high that she could not shoot off at high water mark, and
broke a hole in her not easily to be stopped; so that all the
signals they gave for the boat to come on board were in
vain. This obliged them to send another boat ashore, with
ten men armed, whose faces the captain plainly descried,
the boatswain being the chief officer; but he said there
were three honest lads among them, who were forced
into the conspiracy. Hereupon I gave him fresh courage
(for I had perceived he was in concern) in the mean while securing our prisoners, except two, whom we took to our
assistance, we thought ourselves able enough to adventure
a battle. When the sailors landed, and beheld their boat
in that condition, they not only hallooed, but.fired for their
companions to hear, yet they received no answer. This
struck them with horror and amazement; and thinking their
companions were murdered, they made as if they would re-
turn to the ship. I could |. tceivc the captain's counte-
nance change at this, till of a sudden, three men were or-
dered to look after the boat, while the other seven leapt on
shore in order to search for their companions; and, indeed,
they came to the brow of the hill, near my ancient castle,
from whence they could see to a great distance in the woods,
and there shouting and hallooing, till tired and weary, they
at length seated themselves under a spreading tree. My
opinion was, that nothing could be done till night, when I might use some artifice to get them all out of the boat; But
of a sudden they started up, and made to the sea-side;
hereupon I ordered Friday and the Captain's mate to go
over the creek, and halloo as loud as they could, and so de-
coying them into the woods, come round to me again. And
this, indeed, had good effect; for they followed the noise,
till coming westward to the creek, they called for their boat
to carry them over, and, taking one of the men out of her, left two to look alter her, having fastened her to the stump
of a little tree on shore. Hereupon immediately the captain and our party passing the creek, out of their sight, w»
surprised them both, by tlve Captain's knocking down one,
and ordering the other to surrender upon pain of death,
and who being the honestest of them all, sincerely joined
with us. By this time it was pretty late; when the rest
returning to their boat, which they found aground in the
creek, the tide out, and the men gone, they ran about wring-
ing their hands, crying it was an enchanted island, and that
they should be all murdered by spirits or devils. My men
would willingly have fallen upon them, but I would not
agree to hazard any of our party. But, to be more certain,
Friday and the captain crawled upon their hands and feet,
as near as possible; and when the boatswain approached
in sight, so eager was the captain that he fired and killed
him on the spot; Friday wounded the next man, and a third
ran away. Hereupon I advanced with my whole army;
and, it being dark, I ordered the man we had surprised in
the boat, to call them by their names, and to parley with
them. Accordingly he called out aloud, "Tom Smith,
Tom Smith!" He answered, "Who's that?" « Robinson!"
answered the other. "For God's sake Tom, surrender
"immediately, or you're all dead men." "Who must we
surrender to r" says Smith. "To.our Captain and fifty men
here, who have taken me prisoner, wounded Will Frye,
and killed the boatswain." "Shall we have quarters,
then?" said he. Hereupon the captain calls out, "You
"Smith, you know my voice, surrender immediately, and
you shall have all yourlives granted, except Will Atkins."
Hereupon Atkins cried out, " What have I done, Captain,
'.' more than the rest, who have betn-as bad as me f" But
that was a lie, for he was the person that laid hold of him, and bound him, However, he was ordered to submit to the
governor's mercy, for such was I called. And so, laying'
down their arms, we bound them all, and seized on their
boat.
After this, the captain expostulated with them, telling
them that the governor was an Englishman, who might ex.-
ecute them there; but he thought they would all be sent to
England, except Will Atkins, who was ordered to prepare
for death the nextmorning. Hereupon Atkins implored the
Captain to intercede for his life, and the rest begged they
might not be sent to England. This answered our project
for seizing the ship. For after sending Atkins and two of
the worst fast bound to the cave, and the rest being com-
mitted to my bower, I sent the captain to treat with them
in the governor's name, offering them pardon if they would
assist in recovering the ship. Upon which they all promis-
ed to stand by him to the last drop of their blood; and who-
ever acted treacherously, should be hanged in chains upon the beach. They were all released on these assurances;
and then the captain repaired to the other boat, making his
passenger Captain of her, and gave him four men well arm-
ed; while himself, his mate, and five more, went in the
other boat. By midnight they came within call of the ship,
when the Captain ordered Robinson to hail her, and tell
them that with great difficulty they had found the men at
last. But while they were discoursing, the captain, his
mate, and the rest entered, and knocked down the second
mate and carpenter, secured those that were upon the deck,
by putting them under hatches, while the other boat's crew
entered and secured the forecastle; they then broke into
the roundhouse, where the mate, after some resistance, shot
the pirate captain through the head, upon which all the rest
yielded themselves prisoners. And thus the ship being re-
covtred, the joyful signal was fired, which I heard with
the greatest joy imaginable: nor was it long before he
brought the ship to an anchor at the creek's mouth, where
coming to me unawares, "There," says he, "my dearest
"friend and deliverer, there is your ship, and we are your
"servants :'' a comfort so unspeakable, as made me swoon
in his arms, while, with gratitude to heaven, we were ten-
derly embracing each other.
Nothing now remained, but to consult what we should
do with the prisoners, whom he thought it was not safe to
take on board. Hereupon concerting with the captain, I
dressed myself in one of his suits, and sending for them, told
them, that I was going to leave the island with all my peo>
pTe, if they would tarry there, their lives should be spared,
if not, they should be hanged at the first port they came at.
They agreed to stay. Hereupon I told them my whole story,
charging them to be kind to the Spaniards, that were ex-
pected, giving them al^my armsrand informing them ofevery
thing necessary for their subsistence, after which, I and my
man Friday went on board. But the next morning, twoofth*
men came swimming to the ship's side, desiring the captain to take them on board, though he hanged them afterwards,
complaining mightily how barbarously the others used them. Upon which I prevailed with the captain to take them in;
and being severely whipt and pickled, they proved more
honest for the future. And so 1 bid farewell to this island,
carrying along with me my money, my parrot, umbrella, and goat-skin cap; setting sail December 12, 1686, after
twenty-eight years, two months, and nineteen days resi-
dence, that same day and month that I'escaped from Salee,.
landing in England June II, 1687, after fiv-e and thirty
years absence from my own country, which rendered me
altogether a stranger there.
Here I found my first Captain's widow alive, who had-
buried a second husband, but in very mean circumstances,
and whom I made easy upon his account. Soon after, I
went down to Yorkshire, where all my family was expired,
except two sisters, and as many of one of my brother's
children. I found no provision had been made for me, they concluding I had been long since dead; so that I was
but in a very slender station. Indeed the captain did me
a great kindness, by his report to the owners, how I had
delivered their ship on the Desolate Island, upon which they
made me a present of 2001. sterling. 1 nex.t went to Lis-
bon, taking my man Friday with me, and there arriving in
April, I met the Portuguese captain, who had taken me on
board on the African coast; but, being ancient, he had left
off the sea, and resigned all his business to his son, who
followed the Brazil trade. So altered both of us were, that
we did not know each other at first, till I discovered my-
self more fully to him. After a few embraces, I began to
inquire of my concerns; and then the old gentleman told
me, that it was nine years since he had been at Brazil,
where my partner was then living, but my trustees were
both dead; that he believed I should have a good account
of the product of my plantation; that the imagination of my being lost had obliged my trustees to give an estimate
of my share to the procurator fiscal, who, in case of my not
returning, had given one-third to the king, and the rest to
the monastery of St. Augustine; but if I put in my claim,
or anyone for me, it would be returned,except the yearly
product which was given to the poor. I then desired them
to tell me what improvement he thought had been made on my plantation, and whether he imagined it was worth my
while to look after it? he answered he did not know how
much it was improved; but this he was certain of, that my
partner was grown vastly rich upon his half of it; and, that
he had been informed, that the king had 200 moidores per
annum for his third part. He added, that the survivors of
my trustees were persons of an ingenuous character: that
my partner could witness my title, my name being register-
ed in the country, by which means I should indispensably
recover considerable sums of money. But, answered I, how could my trustees dispose of my effects, when I mad*
you only my heir? This, said he, was true; but, there be-
ing no affidavit made of my death, he could not act as my
executor. However, he had ordered his son, (then at Bra-
zil) to act by procuration upon my account, and he had
taken possession of my sugar-house, having accounted him-
self for eight years with my partner and trustees for the pro-
fits, of which he would give me a very good account.
And indeed, this he performed very faithfully in a few
days, making himself indebted to me 470 moidores of gold,
over and above what had been lost at sea, after I had left
the place. And then he recounted to me what misfortunes
he had gone through, which forced my money out of his
hands, to buy a part in a new ship: "But," says he, " you
"shall not want, take this; and, when my son returns,
"every farthing shall be paid you." Upon which he put
into my hand a purse of 150 moidores in gold; as likewise
the instrument, containing the title to the ship which his
son was in, and which he offered as security for the remain-
der. But really when I saw so much goodnefs, generosity,
tenderness, and real honesty, I had not the heart to accept
it, for fear he should straiten himself upon my account.--
"It is true," said he, " it may be so; but then the money
is yours, not mine, and you may have the greatest occa-
"sion for it." However I returned fifty of them back
again, promising that 1 would freely forgive him tiic other
"3
hundred when I got my effects into my hands, and fhat I
designed to go myself for that purpose. But he told me
he could save me that trouble, and so caused me to enter
my name with a public notary, as likewise my affidavit, with
a procuration affixed to it; and this he ordered me to send
in a letter to one of his acquaintance, a merchant in Brazil;
and indeed, nothing could be more faithfully and honour-
ably observed; for, in seven months time, I had a very faith-
ful account of all my effects, what sums of money were
raised, what expended, and what remained for my use: in a word I found myself to be worth 50001. sterling, and 10001.
per annum. Nor was this all; for my partner congratulated
me upon my being alive, telling me how much my planta-
tion was improved; what Negroes were at work, and how
many Ave Marias he had said to the Virgin Mary for my
preservation; desiring me to accept kindly some presents he
had sent me, which I found showed the greatest generosity.'
No sooner did the ship arrive, but I rewarded my faith-
ful Captain, by returning him the hundred moidores, and
not only forgave him all he owed me, but I allowed him yearly
a hundred more, and fifty to his son, during their lives. And
now being resolved to go to England, I returned letters of
thanks to the Prior of St. Augustine, and in particular to my
old partner, with very suitable presents. By the Captain's
advice, I was persuaded to go by land to Calais, and there
take pafsage for England; when, as it happened, I got a
young English gentleman, a merchant's son at Lisbon, to ac-
company me, together with two English, and two Portu-
fuese gentlemen; so that with a Portuguese servant, an
English sailor, and my man Friday, there were nine of us in
number.
Thus armed and equipped, we set out, and came to Ma-
drid, when the summer decaying, we hasted to Navarre,
where we were informed, that there was scarcely any pas-
sing, by reason of the prodigious quantity of snow; so that
we were obliged to abide near twenty days at Pampeluna,
and at last to take a guide to conduct us safe towards Tho-
louse. And now twelve other gentlemen joining with us,
together with their servants, we had a very jolly company.
Away our guide led us by frightful mountains, and through
so many intricate mazes and windings, that we insensibly
passed them, which, as we travelled along, ushered us into the prospect of the fruitful and charming provinces of Languedoc and Gascoigne.
But now came on two adventures, both tragical and co-
mical. First, our guide was encountered by three wolves
and a bear, who set upon him and his horse, and wounded
him in three places; upon which my man, riding up to his
assistance, shot one of them dead upon the spot, which
made the others retire into the woods. But the pleasanteH
adventure was to behold my man attack the bear. Tii
»uch a creature, that if you let him alone, he will never
meddle with you; and this my man very well knew, and
so begging leave of me in broken English, he told us, " he
"would make good laugh." "Why, you silly fool," said
I, " he'll eat you up at a mouthful." "Eatee me up," re-
plied he, by way of scorn, "me not only eatee him, but
"make much good laugh." Upon which, pulling off his
boots, he claps on his pumps, and running after the monstrous
beast, he called out that he wanted to discourse with him,
and then throwing stones on purpose to incense him, the
beast turns about in fury, and, with prodigious strides,"
shuffles after him. But though he was not swift enough to
keep pace with Friday, who made up to us as it were
for help; yet being angry, " You dog," said 1, '' immedi-
'* ately take horse, and let us shoot the creature." But he
cried, "Dear master, no shoot, me make you laugh much."
And so he turned about, making signs to follow, while the
bear ran after, till coming to a great oak, he ascended in a.
minute, leaving his gun at the bottom of it. Nor did the
bear make any difficulty of it, but ascendediikeacat, though
his weight was very great. You mu,t consider I was not
a little amazed at the folly of my man, as not perceiving any
thing to occasion our laughter, till such time as we rode up
nearer and beheld the beast mounted upon the oak, on the beginning of the same branch, to which Friday clung at th*
farther end, where the bear durst not come. Hereupon
Friday cried out, "Now, master, me make much laugh, me make bear dance." Upon which he fell a shaking th«
bough, which made the creature look behind him, to see how he could retreat. Then, as if the bear had understood
his stammering English; "Why you no come farther,Mr.
"Bearr" said he; " pray Mr. Bear, come far here;" and
then indeed we all burst into a laughter, especially when
we perceived Friday drop like a squirrel upon the ground,
leaving the beast to make the best of his wav down the tiee. M
And now thinking it the most convenient time to shoot the
creature, Friday cried out, "O dear master, no shoot, me
"shoot by and by"; when taking up the gun, "me no
shoot yet," said he, "me make one more much laugh."
And accordingly he was as good as his word; for the crea-
ture descending backward from the tree very leisurely, be-
fore he could lay one foot on the ground, Friday shot him
through the ear, stone dead; and looking to see whether
we were pleased, he burst out into a hearty laughter, say-
ing, " So we kill de bear in my country, not with the gun,
"but with much long arrows." Thus ended our diversion
to our great satisfaction; especially in a place where the
terrible howlings struck us with a continual terror. But
the snows now growing very deep, particularly on the
mountains, the ravenous creatures were then obliged to seek
for sustenance in the villages, where coming by surprise on
the country people, killed several of them, besides a great
number of their sheep and horses. Our guide told us, we had yet one more dangerous place
to pass by; and if there were any more wolves in the coun-
try, there we should find them. This was a small plain
encompassed with woods, to get through a long lane to the
village where we were to lodge. When we entered the
wood, the sun was within half an hour of setting; and a
little after it was set, we came into the plain, which was
not above two furlongs over", and then we perceived five
great wolves cross the road, without taking notice of us,
and so swilt as though they were pursuing after their prey.
Hereupon our guide, believing there were more coming,
desired us to be upon our guard. Accordingly our eyes
were very circumspect, till about half a league farther, we
perceived a dead horse, and near a dozen of wolves devour-
ing its carcase. My man Friday fain would have firtd at
them, but I would not permit him; nor had we gone half
over the plain, but we heard dreadful howlings in a wood
on our left, when presently we saw a hundred come up
against us, as though they had been an experienced ai i;.\.
This obliged us to tbrm ourselves in the best manner^ paA
then I ordered that every other man should fire; and those
who did not, might be ready to give a second volley, should they advance upon us; and then every man should make
use of his pistols. But there was no necessity for this; for
enemy being terrified, stopped at the noise of the fire; four of them Were shot dead, and several others being
wounded, went bleeding away, as we could very plainly
discover by the snow. And now remembering what had
been often told me, that such was the majesty of a man's
voice, as to strike terror even in the fiercest creatures, I or-
dered all our companions to halloo, as loud as pofsible ; and
in this notion I was not altogether mistaken; for they im-
mediately turned about upon the first halloo, and began to
retire; upon which, ordering a second volley in their
rear, they gallopped into the woods with great precipitation.
Thus we had some small time to load our pieces again,
and then made all the haste we could on our way; but we
had not rode far, before we were obliged to put ourselves
in a posture of defence as before, being alarmed with a very
dreadful noise in the same wood, on our left hand, the same
way as we were to pass, only that it was some distance
from us. By this time the darksome clouds began to spread
over the elements, and the night growing very dusky, made
it so much the more to our disadvantage; but still the noise
increasing, we were fully afsured that it was the howling
and yelling ot those ravenous creatures; when presently
three troops of wolves on our front, appeared in sight, as
though a great number of them had a design to surround us,
and devour us in spite of fate. But as they did not fail
upon us immediately, we proceeded on our journey in as s wiit
a manner as the roads would permit our horses, which was
only a large trot. It was in this manner we travelled, till
such a time as we discovered another wood, and had the
prospect of its entrance, through which we were to pass, at
the farthest side of the plain. But surely none can express the terror we were in, when approaching the lane, we per-
ceived a confused number of ihe fiercest wolves, standing,
as it were, guarding its entrance. Nor were we long in
this amazement, before another occasion of horror present-
ed itself; for suddenly we heard the report of a gun at ano-
ther opening in the wood; and looking that way, out ran a
horse bridled and saddled, flying with the greatest swiftness, and no less than sixteen or seventeen wolves pursuing after
him, in order to devour the poor creature; and unquestion-
ably they did so, after thev had run him down, not being able
to hold out that swiftness with which he at first escaped
them.
MS
When we rode up to that entrance from whence the horse
came forth, there lay the carcase of another horse and two
men, mangled and torn by these devouring wolves: and un-
doubtedly one of these men was the person who fired the
gun which we had heard, for the piece lay by him; but,
alas! most of the upper part of his body and his head were
entombed in the bowels of these ravenous creatures.
What course to take, whether to proceed or retreat, we
could not tell; but it was not long before the wolves them-
selves made us to come to a resolution; for such numbers
surrounded us, every one of whom expected their prey,
that were our bodies to be divided among them, there would
not be half a mouthful a-piece. But happy, very happy it
was for us, that but a little way from the entrance, there lay
some very large timber trees, which I supposed had been
rut down and laid there for sale; amongst which I drew my
little troop, placing ourselves in a line behind one long tree,
which served us for a breast-work, when desiring them to
alight, we stood in a triangle, or three fronts, closing our
bodies in the centre, the only place where we could pre-
serve them.
Never certainly was there a more furious charge than
what the wolves made upon us in this place: and the sight
of the horses, which was the principal prey they aimed at,
provoked their hunger and added to their natural fiercenefs.
They came on us with a most dreadful noise, that made the
woods ring again; and beginning to mount the pieces of
timber, 1 ordered every man to fire, as before directed:
and, indeed, so well did they take their aim, that they killed
several of the wolves at the first volley; but still we were
obliged to keep a continual firing, by reason they came on
like devils, pushing one another with the greatest fury.—
But our second volley something abated their courage, when
stopping a little, we hoped they would have made the best
of their way; however, it did not prove so, for others made
a new attempt upon us; and though in four firings we killed
seventeen or eighteen of them, laming twice as many, yet
they several times successively came on, as though they
valued not their lives for the sake of their prey.
Unwilling was 1 to spend our last shot too suddenly, and
therefore calling my other servant, and giving him a horn
of powder, bid him lay a large train quite along the timber,
which he did, while Friday was charging my fusee and his own, with the greatest dexterity. By this time the wolves
coming up the timber, I set fire to the train, by snapping a
discharged pistol close to the powder. This so scorched
and terrified them, that some fell down, and others jumped
in among us; but these were immediately dispatched,
when all the rest, frightened with the light, which the dark-
some night caused to appear more dreadful, began at length
to retire; upon which, ordering our last pistols to be fired
at once, giving at the same time a great shout, the wolves
were obliged to have recourse to their swiftness, and turn
tail; and then we sallied out upon twenty lame ones, cut-
ting them in pieces with our swords, which obliged them
to howl lamentably, to the terror of their fellows, who re-
signed to us the fields as victorious conquerors. And, in-
deed, I question whether Alexander, king of Macedonia,
in any of his conquests, had more occasion for triumph than
we had; for he was but attacked with numerous armies of
soldiers, whereas our little army was obliged to combat a
legion of devils, as it were, worse than the cannibals, who,
the same moment they had slain us, would have sacrificed
us, to satisfy their voracious appetites.
Thus ended our bloody battle with the beasts, having
killed threescore of them, and saved our lives from their
fury. We still had a league farther to go, when, as we
went, our ears were saluted with their most unwelcome
howlings, and we expected every moment another attack.
But, in an hour's time, we arrived at the town where we
were to lodge; and here we found the place strictly guard-
ed, and all in terrible confusion, as well they might, for
fearofthebearsand wolves breaking intothe village, in order
to prey upon their cattle and people. The next morning
we were obliged to take a new guide, by reason the other
fell very bad of his wounds, which he had received, as be-
fore mentioned. After we had reached Tho.ulouse, we
came into a warm, pleasant, and fruitful country, not infest-
ed with wolves, nor any sort of ravenous creatures; and
when we told our story there, they much blamed our guide,
for conducting us through the forest at the foot of the moun-
tains, in such a severe season, when the snow obliged the
wolves to seek for shelter in the woods. When we inform-
ed them in what manner we placed ourselves, and the
horses in the centre, they exceedingly reprehended us, and
M 3
tokl us, it was an hundred to one but we had been all destroyed; for that it was the very sight of the horses, (their
so much desired prey) that made the wolves more ragingly
furious than they would have been, which was evident, by
their beingat other times really afraid of a gun; but then
being exceedingly hungry and furious upon that account,
their eagerness to come at the horses made them insensible
of their danger; and that, if we had not, by a continual
fire. and at last by the cunning stratagem of the train of
powder, got the better of them, it had been great odds if
their number had not overpowered us; besides, it was a
great mercy we alighted from our horses, and fought them
with that courage and conduct, which, had we failed to do,
every man of us, with our beasts, had been devoured; and,
indeed, this was nothing but truth; for never, in my life,
was I so sensible of danger, as when three hundred devils
came roaring upon us, to shun whose unwelcome company,
ir 1 was sure to meet a storm every week, I would rather
go a thousand leagues by sea.
I think I have nothing uncommon in my passage through
France to take notice of, since other travellers of greater
learning and ingenuity, have given a more ample account
than my pen is able to set forth. From Thoulouse I travel-
led to Paris, from thence to Calais, where I took shipping,
and landed at Dover the 14th of January, in a very cold
.season.
Thus come to the end of my travels, I soon discovered
my new found estate, and all the bills of exchange I had
were currently paid. The good ancient widow, my only
privy-counsellor, thought no pains or cares too great to pro-
cure my advantage; nor had I ever occasion to blame her
fidelity, which drew from me an ample reward. I was for
leaving my effects in her hands, intending to set out for
Lisbon, and to the Brazils; but, as in the Desolate Island,
I had some doubts about the Romish religion, so I knew
there was little encouragement to settle there, unless I
would apostatize from the orthodox faith, or live ir. conti-
nual fear of the inquisition. Upon this account I resolved
to sell my plantation; and, for that intent, I wrote to my
old friend at Lisbon, who returned me an answer to my great
satisfaction; which was, that he would sell it to good ac-
count; however, if I thought it convenient to give him li-
beriy to offer it in my name to the two merchants, the sur.
6
vivors of my trustees, residing at Brazils, who consequently
knew its intrinsic value, having lived just upon the spot,
and who I was sensible were very rich, and therefore might
be the more willing to purchase it: he did not in the least
doubt, but that I should make four or five thousand pieces
of eight more of it, than I could if I disposed of it in any
other manner whatsoever.
You may be sure I could not but agree with this kind and
ingenuous proposal; and immediately I sent him an order to offer it to them, which he accordingly did; so that about
eight months after, the ship being in that time returned, he
gave me a satisfactory account, that they not only willingly
accepted the offer, but that they had also remitted 33,OOO
pieces of eight to a correspondent of their own at Lisbon,
in order to pay for the purchase.
Hereupon, in return, I signed the instrument of sale, ac-
cordingto form, which they had sent from Lisbon, and re-
turned it again to my old friend, he having sent me, for my
estate, bills of three hundred and twenty-eight thousand
pieces of eight, reserving the payment of one hundred moidores per annum, which I had allowed him during life,
likewise fifty to his son during life also, according to my
faithful promise, which the plantation was to make good at
a rent charge.
And thus having led my reader to the knowledge of th«
first parts of my life, so remarkable for the many peculiar
providences that attended it, floating in the ocean of uncer-
tainty and disappointment, of adversity and prosperity, beginning foolishly, and yet ending happily; methinks, now that I am come to a safe and pleasant haven, it is time to
cast out my anchor, and, laying up my yefsel, bid, fo»ia
while, adieu to foreign adventures. I had no other concerns
to look after, but the care of my brother's two sons, which,
with the good widow's persuasions, obliged me to continue
at home seven years. One of these children I bred up a
gentleman, and the other an experienced sailor, remarkable
for his courage and bravery. Besides this, I married a vir-
tuous young gentlewoman, of a very good family, by whom
I had two sons and one daughter. But my dear and tender
wife leaving this earthly stage, (as in the second part of my
life you will hear) which rent my soul, as it were, asunder,
my native country became weary and tiresome to me; and
my nephew happening to come from sea, tempted me tc
venlure another voyage to the East-Indies, which did in
the year 1694, at which time I visited my island, and in-
formed myself of every thing that happened since my de-
parture.
One might reasonably imagine, that what I had suffered,
together with advanced age, and the fear of losing, not only
what I had gotten, but my life also, might have choaked
up all the seeds of youthful ambition and curiosity, and put
a lasting period to my wandering inclinations, feut as no-
thing but death can fully allay the active part of my life, no
less remarkable for the many various contingencies of it,
you will next perceive how I visited my little kingdom,
saw my succefsors the Spaniards, had an account of the
usage they met with from the Englishmen, agreeing and
disagreeing, uniting and separating, till at last they were
subjected to the Spaniards, who yet used them very ho-
nourably, together with the wonderful and succefsful battles
over the Indians who invaded, and thought to have con-
quered the island, but were repelled by their invincible
courage and bravery, having taken eleven men and five
women prisoners, by which, at my return, I found about
twenty young children on my little kingdom. Here I staid
twenty days, left them supplies of all necessary things, as
also a carpenter and smith, and shared the island into parts,
reserving the whole property to myself. Nor will you be
insensible, by the account of these things, of several new
adventuresl have been engaged in, the battles I have fought,
the deliverances I have met with: and while, in the sur-
prising relations of such remarkable occurrences, I shall de-
scribe many of God's kindest providences to me in particular, no less conspicuous in the same goodness, power, and
majesty of our great Creator, shown one way or other, over
the face of the earth, if duly adverted to.
ROBINSON CRUSOE.
Wherein are contained several strange and surprising account*
- of his Travels, and Ids most remakaible ^Transactions both by
Sea and land; with his •wonderful vision of the dngelic World.
WHEN we consider the puifsant force of Nature, and
what mighty influence it has many times over the
temper of the mind, it will be no such great wonder to tliink,
that my powerful reason should be overcome by a much
stronger inclination. My late acquired kingdom ran con-
tinually in my thoughts all the day, and I dreamed of it in
the night: nay, I made it the continual subject of my talk,
even to impertinence, when I was awake. I had such va-
pours in my head, that I actually supposed myself at my
casile ; .that I not only perceived Friday's father, the old
Spaniard, and the wicked sailors, but that I talked and dis-
coursed with them about their manner of living; thai 1 heard
the things related to me, which I found afterwards to bs
too true; and that I executed my judgments with the greatest
severity upon the offenders. And, indeed, this anticipating
all the pleasing joys of my life, scarcely afforded iv.s one
pleasant hour: my dear and tender wife could not but take
notice of it, which drew those affectionate speeches from
her: "My dear," said she, " I am really persuaded that
"some secret impulse from Heaven occasions in you a de-
"termination to see the island again ; nor am I lefs sensible,
but your being engaged to me and these dear children, is
the only hindrance ofyour departure. I know, my dear,
if I were in the grave, you would not long continue at
home; prevent not your happinefs on my account, whose
only comfort centres in you. All that 1 can. object is, that
such an hazardous undertaking is no way consistent with
a person of your years; but if you are resolved to go,"
added she, weeping, "only permit me to bear you com-
"pany, and that is all that I desire."
Such endearing tenderness, graced with the most inno-
cent, and yet most powerful charms, brought me insensibly
into my right understanding ; and when I considered all the transactions of my life, and particularly my new engage-
ment; that I had now one child already born, and my wife*
big of another; and that I had no occasion to seek for more
riches, who already was blessed with sufficiency, with much struggling I altered my resolutions at last, resolving to apply
myself to some business or other, which might put a period
to such wandering inclinations. Hereupon I bought a little
farm in the county of Bedford, with a resolution tc move
thither; upon this there was a pretty convenient house,
surrounded with land, very capable of improvement, which
suited my temper, as to planting, managing, and cultivating.
Nor was 1 long before I entered upon my new settlement,
having bought ploughs, harrows, carts, waggons, horses,
cows, and sheep ; so that I now led the life of a country
gentleman, and as happy in my retirement as tht: greatest
monarch in the world. And what made me think my happiness the greater was, that I was in the middle state of
life, which my father had so often recommended, much re-
sembling the felicity of a rural retirement, which is elegantly
described by the poet in these lines:
Free from att vfces* free from care,
Age has no pain, and youth no snare.
But in the midst of this my happiness, I wss suddenly
plunged in the greatest sorrow that I could possibly endure;
for, when I least expected it, my dear and tender wife was
forced to submit to the irresistible power of death, leaving
this transitory life for a better. It is impossible for me to
express the beauties of her mind, or the loveliness of her
Eerson; neither can I too much lament her loss, which my
latest breath shall record; her influence was greater over
me than the powers of my own reason, the importunities of
friends, the instructions of a father, or the melting tears of a
tender and disconsolate mother; in a word, she was the
spirit of all my affairs, and the centre of my enterprizes—But now, since the cruel hand of death had closed my dear-
est'seyeSj 1 seemed in my thoughts a stranger to the world;
my privy-counsellor being gone, I was like a ship without a
pilot, that could only run before the wind. And when I
looked around me in this busy world, one part labouring
for bread, and the other squandering away their estates;
this put me in mind how I had lived in my little kingdom,
wliere both reason and religion dictated to me, that there
was something that certainly was the reason and end of life,
which was far superior to what could be hoped for on this
side the grave. My country delights were now as insipid
and dull, as music and science to those who have neither
taste nor ingenuity. In short, resolving to leave off house-
keeping, 1 left my farm, and in a few months returned to
London.
But neither could that great city, so famous for its variety
of entertainment, afford me any agreeable delight; a state
of idleness I found to be the very dregs of life, and most
hurtful to body and soul. It was now the beginning of the
year 1(584, at which time my nephew (who, as I before ob-
served had been brought up to the sea, and advanced to be
captain of a ship) was returned from a short voyage to Bil-
boa, the first he had made in that station. He comes to me
one morning, telling me, that some merchants of his ac-
quaintance had proposed to him to go a voyage for them to
the East-Indies and China, in the manner of private traders;
"and now uncle," said he, "if you'll accompany me thither,
I'll engage to land you upon your own island, to visit the
state of your little kingdom."
Just before he came in, my thoughts were fixed to get a
patent for its possession, and then to fill it with inhabitants.
After I had paused a while, and looked stedfastly on him,
"Wliat devil or spirit," said I, " sent you with this un-
lucky errand r" He started at first; but recovering him-
self, when he perceived I was not offended, "Sir," replied
he, "what I have proposed cannot, I hope, be styled un-
lucky, since certainly you must be desirous to see your little
territory, where you reigned with more content than any of
your brother kings in the universe."—" Nephew," said I,
"if you will leave me there, and call for me as you come
back, I care not if I give my consent:" but he answered,
that the merchants would not allow their vessel, loaded with an infinite value, to return there again, which was a
month's sail out of the way; "besides, Sir," said he, "if I
should miscarry, was your request granted, why then you
would be locked up as before." This, indeed, carried a
great deal of reason in it; but we found out a remedy, an I
that was to carry a framed sloop on board, ready to be set
up in the island, by the assistance of some carpenters, which
we should carry with us, that might be fitted in a few days to go to sea. I was not long in forming my resolution,
which overswayed my good friend, the widow's, persuasions,
and the natural affection I bore to my young children. I
made my will, and settled my estate in' such manner, that I
was perfectly sure my poor infants would have justice done
them. The good widow not only undertook to make pro-
vision for my voyage, but also took the charge of my do-
mestic affairs, and to provide for my children's education;
and indeed no mother could take more care, or understood
the office better; for which I lived to reward and refurn
her my hearty thanks.
The beginning of January, 1694-5, my nephew being
ready to sail, I and Friday went on board in the Downs on
the 8th, having, besides that sloop already mentioned, a
very considerable cargo for my new colony. First, I had
'ome servants, whom I proposed to leave there, as they
should appear willing; there were two carpenters, a smith,
and a very ingenious fellow who was Jack-of-all-trades; for
he was not only a cooper by trade, but also was dextrous at
making wheels, and hand-mills to grind corn, likewise a
good turner, and a good pot-maker. 1 also carried a tailor,
who consented to stay in my plantation, and proved a most
necessary fellow in the island. As to my cargo, it consisted
of a sufficient quantity of linen, and English stuffs for cloth-
ing the Spaniards that I expected to find there; as likewise
gloves, hats, shoes, stockings; together with beds, bedding,
and household stuff, especially kitchen utensils, with pots,
kettles, pewter, brass, &c. also nails, tools of all sorts,
staples, hooks, hinges, and all other things necessary ; all
which, I think, cost me about three hundred pounds. Nor
was this all; for I carried a hundred spare arms, markets
and fusees, besides some pistols, a considerable quantity of
several sorts of shot, two brass cannon, besides swords,
cutlasses, and the iron part of some pikes and halberts. I made my nephew take with us two small quarter-deck
guns, more than he had occasion for in his ship, to leave be-
hind, if there was a necessity; so that we might build a
fort there, and man it against all opposers whatsoever. Well, we put out to sea, and though I can't say this
voyage was so unprosperous as my others ha.d been, yet
contrary winds drove us so far nothward, that we were
obliged to put in at Galway, in Ireland, where we lay
wind-bound Iwo and twenty days. Here, indeed, our j ro-
visions were very cheap, and we added to our ship's stores
by taking several live hogs, two cows and calves, which I
then resolved to put on shore in my island, if our necessities did not call for them. On the Sth of February we sailed
from Ireland, with a very fair gale, which lasted for some
days; and I think it was about the 20th of the same monthj
late in the evening, when the mate informed us, that he
saw a flash of fire, and heard a gun fired t and when he was
speaking, a boy came in and told us, that the boatswain had
heard another. Upon which vfe all ran to the quarter deck>
from whence, in a few moments, we perceived a terrible
fire at a distance. We had immediately recourse to our
reckonings, in which we were all of opinion, that there
could be no land that way, it appearing to be atN. N. W.
Hereupon we concluded that some ship had taken fire at
sea, and that it could not be far off, by the report of the
guns which we had heard. We made up directly to it, and
in half an hour's time, the wind being fair, we could plainly
perceive a great ship on fire, in the middle of the sea.—
Touched with this unhappy disaster, and considering my
former circumstances, when the Portuguese Captain took
me up, I immediately ordered five guns to be fired, that the
poor creatures, not seeing us, it being dark, (though we
could perceive their flame) might be sensible there was de-
liverance at hand, and consequently might endeavour to
save themselves in their boat. Nor was it long before the
ship blew up in the air, and the fire was extinguished in
the ocean. But supposing them all to be in their boats, we hung out our lanterns, and kept firing till eight o'clock in
the morning; when, with our perspectives, we beheld two
boats full of people, making towards us, though the tide was
against them: then spreading out our ancient, and hanging
out a waft, as a signal for them to come on board, in half an hour's time we came up with them, and took them all in,
there being no less than sixty-four men, women, and chil-
dren. It was a French merchant ship of three hundred tons,
homeward-bound from Quebec, in the river of Canada.—
The master informed me how, by the negligence of the
steersman, the steerage was set on tire: that, at his outcry for help, the fire was, as he thought, totally extinguished;
but that some sparks getting between the timber and within
the ceiling, it proceeded into the hold, where there was na
resisting it; and then they got into their boats, as creatures
in the last extremity, with what provision they had, together
with oars, sails, and a compass, intending to go back to
Newfoundland, the wind blowing at S. E. and by E. though
there were several chances against them, as storms to over-
set and founder them, rains and colds to benumb and perish
their limbs, and contrary winds to keep them back and
starve them; but, said he, in this our great distress, we
heard the welcome report of your guns, when, with unspeak-
able joy, taking down our masts and sails, we were resolved
to lie by till morning; but perceiving your light, we set
our oars at work, to keep our boat ahead, the sooner to
attain your ship, the happy instrument of our deliverance. Indeed no one can express the joy of these poor crea-
tures on this occasion; fear and grief are easily set forth;
sighs and tears, with a few motions of the hands and head,
all are the demonstrations of these passions; but an excess of joy carries in it a thousand extravagances; especially,
I think, among the French, whose temper is allowed to be
more volatile, passionate, sprightly, and gay, than that of
other nations. Some were weeping, tearing themselves in
the greatest agonies of sorrow, and running stark mad about
the ship, while the rest were stamping with their feet,
wringing their hands, singing, laughing, swooning away,
vomiting, fainting, with a few returning hearty thanks to
the Almighty, and crossing themselves. I think, if I am
not mistaken, our surgeon was obliged to let thirty of them
blood. But among the passengers, there were two priests,
the one an old, and the other a young man; but what amazed
me more was, that the oldest was in the worst plight; for
no sooner did he perceive himself freed from danger, but he dropped down, as it were, without life, and to every one's ap-
pearance quite dead; but the surgeon chafing and rubbing
his arm, opened a vein, which at first dropped, and then
flowing more freely, the old man began to open his eyes,
and in a quarter of an hour was well again. But soon re-
Tnembering this happy change, the joy of which whirled his
blood about faster than the vefsels could convey it, he be-
came so feverish, as made him more fit for bedlam than any
other place; but the surgeon giving him a sleepy dose,
he was perfectly composed the next morning.
Remarkable, indeed, was the behaviour of the young
priest. At his entrance on board the ship, he fell on his face in the most humble prostration to the Almighty. I thought,
indeed, he had fallen into a swoon, and so ran to help him
up; but he modestly told me, he was returning thanks to
the Almighty, desiring me to leave him a few moments,
and that, next to his Creator, he would return me thanks
also. And indeed he did so, about three minutes after, with
great seriousness and affection, while the tears stood in his
eyes, which convinced me of the gratitude of his soul. Nor
did he less show his piety and wisdom, in applying himseit
'to his country people, and labouring to compost: ti.e:ii, by
the most powerful reasons, arguments, and persuasions.--.
And when, indeed, these people had taken their night's re-
pose, in such lodgings as our ship would allow, we found
nothing but the best of manners, and the most civil acknow-
ledgments, for which the French are eminently remarkable.
The next day the captain and one of the priests desired to
speak with me and my nephew the commander. They
told us, that they had saved some money and valuable things
out of the ruined vessel, which was at our service; only that they desired to be set on shore some where in our way.
At the first my nephew was for accepting the money; but
I (who knew how hard my case would have been, had the
Portuguese captain served me so) persuaded him to the con-
trary; and therefore told them, that as we had done nothing
but what we were obliged to do, by nature and humanity,
and what we ourselves might expect from others in such
calamity, so we took them up to save them, not to plunder
them, or leave them naked upon the land,to perish for
want of subsistence, and therefore would not accept their
money: but as to landing them, that was a great difficulty;
for being bound to the East-Indies, it was mipofsible, wil-
fully, to change our voyage upon their particular account,
nor could my nephew (who was under charter party to
pursue it by way of Brazil) answer it to the freighters.—
All that we could do, was to put ourselves in the way of
meeting some ships homeward-bound from the West-Indies,
that, if possible, they might get a passage to France or
England. Indeed, they were very thankful for our first
kindnefa; but were under great concern, especially the
passengers; at their being carried to the East-Indies. They
begged, therefore, I would keep on the banks of Newfound-
land, where probably they might meet with some ship or N 2
sloop, to carry them to Canada, whence they came. As this was but a reasonable request, I was inclined to grant it,
since it was no breach of charter party, and the laws of God
and nature obliged us to do what good we could to our
fellow-creatures; and besides the danger we ourselves should be in for want of provisions: so we consented to
carry them to Newfoundland, if wind and weather would
permit; if not that we should carry them to Martinico in
the West-Indies. But, as it happened, in a week's time we made the banks of Newfoundland, where the French
people hired a bark to carry them to France. But the young
priest being desirous to goto the East-Indies, I readily agreed
to it, because I liked his conversation, and two or three of
the French sailors also entered themselves on board our ship.
. Now, directing our course for the West-Indies, steering
S. and S. by E. about twenty days, with little wind, ano-
ther adventure happened to exercise our humanity. In the
latitude of 27 degrees, 5 minutes north, the IDth of March,
j 694-5, we perceived a sail, (our course S. E. and by S.)
which bore upon us, nnd then she appeared to be a larg«
vefsf), having lost her tnain.top-mast and boltsprit; when
fi:ing a gun as a signal of distrefs, windN. N. W. we soon
can:e to speak with her. She was a ship from Bristol, bound
jiumelromBarbadoes, out of which road she had been forced
in a hurricane to the west.war*!, in which they lost their masts.
They told us, their expectations were to see the Bahama
islands, but were driven away by a strong wind at N. N. W.
and having no sails to work the ship with, but the main-
Bourse, and a kind of a square sail upon a jury fore-mast,
because they could not come near the land, were endeavour-
ing to stand for theCanaries: nay, what was worse, besides
all their fatjgue, they were almost starved for want of pro-
Vision, having ate nothing for eleven days; all that they had
aboard was sugar, a barrel of fresh water, and seven casks
of rum. In this ship were pafsengers, a youth, his mother,
and a maid-servant, who were in a most deplorable condition
for want of food. If I had not gone on board their ship,
the knowledge of their misery had been concealed from me,
and they would have inevitably perished, though, indeed,
their second mate who was captain, by reason the true
captain was not on board when the hurricane happened,
had before informed me that there were such persons on
board, whom he supposed to be dead, being afraid to inquire after them, because he had nothing to give them for relief. Hereupon we resolved to let them have what we could
spare, ordering the mate to bring some of his men on board
us, which he did accordingly: as he and they looked like
skeletons, when meat was set before them I ordered them
to eat sparingly. But, however, they soon fell sick; which
obliged the surgeon to mix something in their broth, which
was to be to them both food and physic. When they weru
fed, we ordered our mate to carry them a sack of bread,
and four or five piects of beef; but the surgeon charged
them to see it boiled,and keep a guard on the cook-room, to prevent the men from eating it raw, and consequently
killing themselves with what was designed for their relief.
But, particularly, I desired the mate to see what condition
the poor pafsengers were in, and the surgeon gave him a
pitcher of the same broth which he had prepared for the men. And being curious to see this scene of misery myself,
I took the Captain (as we called the mate of the ship) in .
our own boat, and sailed after them.
Here was a sad sight indeed! scarce were the victuals
half boiled in the pot, but they were ready to break open
the cook-room door. To stay their stomachs, the mate gave
them biscuits, which were dipped and softened with the
liquor of the meat, which they call bruise; telling them it
was for their own safety, that he was obliged to give them
but a little at a time; and so feeding them gradually, their
bellies were comfortably filled, and the men did very well
again. But when they came to the poor gentlewoman in
the cabin, who for several days had continued without food, giving what she had to her son, they found her, as it were, in the arms of death. She was sitting upon the floor of the
deck, with her back up against the sides, between two
chairs, which were lashed fast, and her head shrunk be-
tween her shoulders, like a senseless corpse. Nothing was
wanting in my mate to revive and encourage her; opening
her lips, and putting some broth into her mouth with a spoon. But not having strength to speak, she lifted up her head
with much difficulty, intimating that it was now too late!
at the same time pointing to the youth her son, as though
she desired him to do what he could to save the lad; and,
in a little time after, she died.
The youth, indeed, was not so far gone, yet lay stretched
out on the cabin bed. like one that had scarce anv life, in
N 3
his mouth was a piece of an old glove, the rest of which he
had ate up. At first he vomited what the mate had given
him; but at length began sensibly to revive, though in the
greatest concern for the death of his tender mother. As to the poor maid, she lay by her mistress, like one in
the last pangs of death: her limbs were distorted, one of her
hands was clasped round the frame of a chair, which she
grasped so hard, that it was with some difficulty we sepa-
rated her from it; her other arm lay over her head, and her
feet lay both together, set fast against the frame of the cabin
table; not only being starved with hunger, but overcome
with grief at the loss of her mistress, whom she loved most
tenderly. It was a great while before the surgeon could
bring her to life, and a much longer time before she came
to her senses. After we had sailed with them some days, we sent them
five barrels of beef, one of pork, two hogsheads of biscuit,
with pease, flour, and other things; taking three casks of
sugar, some rum, and some pieces of eight as payment, we
left them, but took the youth and maid with us, with all
their goods. The lad was about seventeen years old, very
haiidsome, modest, sensible, and well-bred, but mightily
concerned for the loss of his honoured mother, having lost
his father at Barbadoes but a few months before. He be-
seeched the surgeon to intercede with me to take him out
of the ship; for that the sailors, not sparing a small suste-
nance, had starved his mother. But hunger has no bounds,
no right, and consequently is incapable of any compassion. When the surgeon told him, our voyage might put him in
bad circumstances, and farther from his friends, he said he
did not care, if he was delivered from that terrible crew;
that as the captain (meaning me) had saved him from death,
so he was sure he would do him no harm; and, as for the
maid, when she was restored to her senses, she would be
no lefs thankful, let us carry them where we would. And
indeed the surgeon so represented their case to me, that I
consented, and took them on board, with all their goods,
except eleven hogsheads of sugar; but the youth having a
bill of lading, I made the commander oblige himself to de-
liver a letter and the deceased widow's goods to Mr. Rogers,
a men ban I in Bristol; but I believe the ship was lost at sea,
for we never could hear win' became of her afterwards. We
were now in the latitude 19 dog. 32 min. having as yet a tolerable good voyage. But, passing by several little incidents relating to wind and weather, I shall relate what is most re-
markable concerning my little kingdom, to which I was
then drawing near. I had great difficulty in finding it, for
as I came to, and went from it before, on the south and east
side of the island, as coming from the Brazils, so now ap-
proaching between the main and the island, not having any
chart of the coast, nor land mark, it obliged us to go on
shore on several islands in the mouth of the river Oroonoko,
but to no purpose. Thus I perceived, that what I thought
was a continent before, was no such thing, but a long island,
or rather a ridge of sands. On one of these islands I found
some Spaniards, but they belonged to the isle de Trinidad,
who came hither in a sloop to make salt, and try to find
some pearl muscles. But at length I came fair on the
south-side of my island, and then I presently knew the
countenance of my little kingdom: so we brought the ship
safe to an anchor, broadside within the creek, where stood
my ancient and venerable castle.
No sooner did I see the place, but calling for Friday, I
asked him where he was? but when he looked a little, he
clapped his hands, crying,-"O joy, O there, O yes, O
there!" pointing to our old abode, and then fell a dancing
and capering as if he was mad, and I had much ado to keep
him from jumping into the sea, to swim ashore. "Friday,"
said I, "what do you think, shall we go to see your father?"
at the mentioning his father's name, the poo'r affectionate
creature fell a weeping: "No, no," says he, " me see him
no more, never^see poor father more! he long ago die, die
long ago; he much old man." "Youdon't know that,"
said I, "but shall we see anybody "else?" He looks about,
and pointing to the hill above my house, cries out, "We
see, wesee there much men and there;" which, though I
could not perceive them with my perspective glass, was
true, by what the men themselves told me the next day.
When the English ancient was spread, and three guns
fired, as a signal of friendship, we perceived a smoke rise
from the creek; upon which I ordered the boat out, taking
Friday with me, and hanging out a white flag of truce, I
went on shore, accompanied also by the young friar, to
whom I had related the history of the first part of my life;
besides, we had sixteen men well armed, in case we had
met with any opposition,
After we had rowed directly into the creek, the first man
t fixed my eye upon was the Spaniard, whose life I had
saved, and whose face I perfectly well knew. I'ordered
them all to stay in the boat for a while; but Friday, per-
ceiving his father at a distance, would have jumped into the
sea, had they not let the boat go. No sooner was he on
shore, but he flew like a swift arrow out of a bow to em-
brace his aged father. Certainly it would melt a man of
the firmest resolution into the softest tears, to see with what
uncommon transports of joy he saluted him; he first kifsed
him, then stroked his face, took him in his arms, laid him
under a shady tree, sat down by him, then looked as ear-
aiestly at him, as one would do at a picture, for a quarter of
an hour together. After this he would lie upon the ground,
stroke his legs and kiss them, then get up and stare at him,
as though he was bewitched; but the next day one could
not forbear laughter to see his behaviour; for he would walk
several hours with his father along the shore, leading him
by the hand, as though he was a lady: while, every now and
then, he would run to the boat to get something for him, as
a lump of sugar, dram, biscuit, or something or other that
was good. His frolics ran in another channel in the after-
noon; when he set old Friday on the ground, he would
dance round him, making comical postures and gestures;
and all this while would be telling him one story or another
of his travels and adventures.
It was on the ] Oth" of April, anna 1695, that I set my
foot upon the island a second time. When my faithful
Spaniard, accompanied by one more, approached the boat,
he little knew who I was, till I discovered myself to him.
"Seignior," said I, in Portuguese, "don't you know me?"
He spoke never a word, but giving his musket to his attend-
ant, extended his arms, and sajing something in Spanish
that I did not then understand, he came forward and em-
braced me, saying, he was inexcusable not to know his de-
liverer, who like an angel sent from heaven, had saved his
life. He then beckoned to the man to call out his com-
panions; asked me if I would walk to my own habitation,
and take possession, where I should find some mean im-
provements; but indeed they were extraordinary ones; for
they had planted so many trees so close together, that the
place was like a labyrinth, which none could find out ex-
cept themselves, who knew its intricate windings. I asked him the meaning of all these fortifications? he fold me he
would give a large account of what had pafsed since my
departure till this time, and how he had subdued some Eng.
lish, who thought to be their murderers, hoping I would
not be displeased, since necessity compelled them to it.—As I knew they were wicked villains, so I told him, that I
was not only far from finding fault with it, but was rather
heartily glad that they had subdued them. While we were
thus talking, the man whom he sent, returned, accompanied
by eleven more, but in such habits, that it was impossible to tell what nations they were of. He first turned to me,
and pointing to them, "These, Sir," said he, "are some of
the gentlemen who owe their lives to your goodness;" then
turning to them, and pointing to me, he made them sensi-
ble who I was; and then indeed they saluted me one by
one, not as ordinary men, but as though they had been am-
ba(sadors or noblemen, and 1 a triumphant conqueror; for
their behaviour not only agreed with a manlike, majestic
gravity, but at the same time was so obliging and courteous,
as made them agreeable to the last degree.
Before I relate the history of the transactions of my king-
dom, as I had it from the Spaniard's own mouth, 1 must
here insert what I omitted in my former relation. The
matter is this: just before we weighed anchor and set sail,
there happened a quarrel on board the ship, which had like to
have occasioned a second mutiny, till such time as the cou-
rageous captain, taking twoof the most refractory prisoners,
laid them in irons, threatening, as they were concerned in
the former disorders, to have them hanged in England for
running away with the ship. This frightened some of the
rest, as thinking the captain would serve them in the
same manner, though he seemed to give them good words
for the present. But the mate having intelligence of this,
made me acquainted with their fears; so that, to make
them more easy, and ourselves more safe from their conspi-
racies, I was obliged to go down, and pass my honour's
word for it, that upon their good behaviour, all that was
past should be forgiven; in testimony of which, I ordered
the two men's irons to be taken off, and themselves for-
given. But as this had brought us to an anchor at night,
in which there was a calm, the two men that had been in
irons, stole each of them a musket, and some other weapons,
and taking the ship's pinnace, not yet hauled up, ran away L .
to their brother rogues. The next morning we sent the long-boat, with men to pursue them, but all in vain; the
mate, in revenge, would have demolished my little castle,
burnt its furniture, and destroyed their plantations, but
having no orders for it, he did not put'it in execution.—And thus there were five Englishmen in the island, which
caused great differences, as my faithful Spaniard gavemea
perfect accountof, in the following manner:
"You cannot, Sir, but remember the embassy you sent
me about, and what a disappointment we met with, by your
absence, at our return. There is but little variety in the
relation of all our voyage, beijig blefsed with calm weather,
and a smooth sea. Great indeed was the joy of my coun-
trymen to see me alive, having acted as the principal man
on board, the captain of the shipwrecked vefsel dying before;
nor was their surprise less, as knowing I wastaken prisoner
by the savages of another nation, they had thought me long
since entombed in their monstrous bowels. But when I
showed them the arms, ammunition, and provisions I had
brought for them, they looked upon me as a second Joseph
advanced in Pharaoh's court, and immediately prepared to
come along with me. Indeed they were obliged to trespass upon their friendly savages, by borrowing two of their
canoes, under a pretext for fishing; and they came away the next morning, but without any provisions of their own,
except a few roots, which served them instead of bread.—After three weeks' absence, we arrived at our habitation.
Here we met with three English sailors, who, I confeP;,
gave us provisions, and that letter of direction you had left
for us, which informed us how to bring up tame goats, plant
corn, cure grapes, make pots, and, in short, every thing
that was necessary for our use. As, in particular, I knew
your method best, so taking Friday's father to assist me, we
managed all the affairs; nor were the rest of the Spaniards
wanting in their kind offices, dressing food for the English-
men, who did nothing but ramble and divert themselves in
the woods, either shooting parrots, or catching tortoises.
But we had not been long ashore, before we were informed
of two more Englishmen, naturally turned out of their com-
mon place of residence, by the three others above mention-
ed; this made my Spaniards and me (whom they now
looked upon as theirgovernor in your absence) endeavour to
persuade them to take them in,thatwemight be as one family; but all our entreaties were in vain, so that the poor fellows.
finding nothing to be done without industry, pitched their
tents on the north side of the island, a little inclining to the
west, for fear of savages. Here they built two huts, one to
lodge, and the other to lay their stores in; for my good natur-
ed Spaniard giving them some seeds, they dug and planted as I had done, and began to live prettily. But while they
were thus comfortably going on, the three unnatural brutes,
their countrymen, in a mere bullying humour, insulted them,
by saying, the governor, (meaning you) had given them a
pofsefsion of the island, and d—mn 'em they should build no
houses upon their ground, without paying rent. The two
honest men (for so let me now distinguish them)thought their
three countrymen only jested, and one of them invited them
in, to see their fine habitations; while the other facetiously
told them, that since they built tenements with great im-
provements, they should, according to the custom of lords,
give him a longer lease; at the same time desiring them to
tetch a scrivener to draw the writings. One of these
wretches swearing he should pay for the jest, snatches up a
fire-brand, and clapping it to the outside of their hut, very
fairly set it on fire, which would soon have consumed it,
had not the honest man thrust him away, and trod it out
with his feet. Hereupon the fellow returns with his pole,
with which he would have ended his days, had not the
poor man avoided the blow, when fetching his musket, he
knocked down the villain that began the quarrel. The
other two coming to assist their fellow, obliged the honest
man to take his musket also, and both of them presenting
their pieces, bid the villains stand off; and if they did not
lay down their arms, death should decide the dispute one
way or other. This brought them to a parley, in which
they agreed to take their wounded man and begone; but
they were in the wrong that they did not disarm them when
they had the power, and then make their complaint to me
and^my Spaniards for justice, which might have prevented
their farther designs against them. And, indeed, so many
trespafses did they afterwards commit, by treading down
their corn, shooting their young kids and goats, aud plagu-
ing them night and day, that they resolved to come to my
castle, challenge all the three, and decide their right by one
plain battle, while the Spaniards stood by to see fair play.
One day it happened, that two of my Spaniards (one of -whom understood English) being in the woods, were met
by one of the honest men, who complained how barbarous
their countrymen had been in destroying their corn, killing
their milk-goat, and three kids, which deprived them of their
subsistence; and tbat if we did not grant them relief, they
must be inevitably starved, and so they parted; but when
my Spaniards came home at night, and supper being on the
taWe, one of them began to reprehend the Englishmen, but
in a very mannerly way; which they resenting, replied,
"Whut businefs had their countrymen in that place without
leave, when it was none of their ground?" "Why," said
•Qy Spaniard, calmly, "laglise, they must not starve:" but
they replied, " Let them starve and be damn'd, they should
neither plant nor build; and damn them, they should be
their servants, and work tor them, for the island was theirs,
and they would burn all the huts they shpuld find in the
island." *4 By this rule," said my Spaniard, smiling,"' We
shall be your servants too-" "Aye, by G—d, and so you
shall," replied the impudent rascal. Upon which, starting
up, Will Atkins cries, "Come, Jack, let's have t'other
brush with them, who dare to build in our dominions?''—
Thus leaving us something heated with just pafsion, away
they trooped, every man having a gun, pistol, and sword,
muttering soti!e threatening words, that we could then but
imperfectly t. iderstand. That night they designed to mur-
der their two companions, and slept till midnight in the
bower, thihV:ng .to Tall upon them in their sleep; nor were
the honest men Iefs thoughtful concerning them; for at this
juncture thev v. ere coming to find them out, but in a much
fairer way. As soon as the villains came to the huts, and
found no body tin re> they concluded that I and my Spaniard
had given them notice, and therefore swore to be revenged
on us. Then they demolished the poor men's habitations;
not by fire as they attempted before, but pulled down their
houses limb from limb, not leaving stick or stone on the
ground where they stood, broke their household stuff in
pieces, tore up their trees, spoiled their inclosure, and, in
short, quite ruined them of every thing they had. Had
these people met together, no doubt but there would have
been a bloody battle; but Providence ordered it lor the
better; for just as the three were got together, the two
xvere at our castle; and when they left us, the three came
back again, but in great rage, scoffing!/ telling us what they had done; when one taking hold of a Spaniard's hat,
twirls it round, saying, "And you, Seignior Jack Spaniard,
shall have the same sauce, if you don't mend your manners."
My Spaniard, a grave but courageous man, knocked him
down with one blow of his tist; at which another villain
fired his pistol, and narrowly milled his body, but wounded
him a little in the ear. Hereat enraged, the Spaniard takes
up the fellow's musket whom he had knocked down, and would have shot him, if I and the rest had not com*: our,
and taken their arms from every one of them.
"These Englishmen perceiving they had made all of us
their enemies, began to cool; but notwithstanding their
bitter words, the Spaniards would not return them their arms again, telling them they would do them no manner of
harm, if they would live peaceably; but if they offered any injury to the plantation or castle, they would shoot them as
they would do ravenous beasts. This made them so mad,
that they went away raging like furies of hell. They were
no sooner gone, but in came the two honest men, fired with
the justest rage, if such can be, having been ruined as afore-
said. And indeed it was very hard, that nineteen of us
should be bullied by three villains, continually offending
with impunity."It was a great while, Sir, before we could persu..ide the
two Englishmen from pursuing, and undoubtedly killing
them with their fire-atms; but we promised them justice
should be done them; and, in the mean time, they should
reside with us in our habitation. In about five days after,
these three vagrants, almost starved with hunger, drew near
our grove, and perceiving me, the governor, and two others
walking by the side of the creek, they very submifsively
rit.sirud to be received into the family again. We told
them of their great incivility to us, and of their unnatural
barbarity to their countrymen; but yet we would see what
the rest agreed to, and in half an hour's time would bring
them word. Alter some debate, we called them in, where
their two countrymen laid a heavy charge against them,
for not only ruining, but designing to murder them, which
they could not deny. But here I was forced to interpose
as a mediator, by obliging the two Englishmen not to hurt
them, being naked and unarmed; and that the other three
should make them restitution, by building their two huts,
«rd fencHig their ground in the same manner as it was be-
fore. Well, being in a miserable condition, they submitted
to this at present, and lived some time regularly enough,
except as to the working part, which they did not care for,
but the Spaniards would have dispensed with that, had they continued easy and quiet. Their arms being given them
again, they scarce had them a week when they became as
troublesome as ever; but an accident happening soon after,
obliged us to lay aside private resentments, and look to our
common preservation.
"One night, Sir, I went to bed, perfectly well in health,
and yet by no means could I compose myself to sleep; upon
which, being very uneasy, 1 got up and looked out, but it
being dark, I could perceive nothing but the trees around
.the castle. I went to bed again, but it was all one, I could
riot sleep; when one of my Spaniards hearing me walk
about, asked who was up; I answered, " It is I." When
I told him the occasion, "Sir," said he, ** such things are not to be slighted; for certainly there is some mischiefplot-
ting ngtfinst us." "Where pro. the Englishmen;'' said I. He answered, "In their hutsj for they lay separate from
us, Sir, since the last mutiny," Well," said I, "some
kind spirit gives this information for advantage, Come let
us go abroad, and see if any thing offers tojustify our fear*,'*
Upon which 1 and some of my Spaniards went up the moun-
tain, not by the ladder, but through the grove, and then we
were struck wiih a panic fear on seeing a light, as though
it were a fire, at a very little distance, and hearing the voices of several men. Hereupon we retreated immediate"
Iv, and raised the rest of our forces, and made them sensible
of the impending danger j but with all my authority, I could
not make them stay where they were, so earnest were they
to see how thing? went• Indeed, the darkness of the night
gave them opportunity enough to view them by the light of
the fire, undiscovered, As they were in different parties,
end straggling over the shore, we were much afraid that
they should find out our habitations, and destroy eur flocks
of goat* j to prevent which, we sent immediately an Eng,
liflnrpii isiid two Spaniards to drive the goats into the vaV
lt•y where the cave lay i or, if there was occasion, into the
cave iuelf: AS to onr.elve*, resuming our native courage
prudent conduct, had we not been divided, we duitt
iu.e to attack a hundred of them { but before it WM
who immediately stripping himself naked, gets among them
undiscovered, and in two hour's time brings word, that they
were two parties of two different nations, who lately having
fc bloody battle with one another, happened to land by mere
chance in the same island, to devour their miserable pri-,
•toners) that they were entirely ignorant of any person*
inhabiting here \ bitt father being ti'lltid with rage and furs'
agftiust tine amtiher, hj b«li«vea, that &* soon a* day,light'
appeared, there would be a terrible engagement. Old Fri-
day had scarce ended his relation, when we heard an un.
eeffimun neise, and .perceived that there was a horrid en-
gagement between the two armies,
i' 8tt«h was the curiosity of our party, especially the Eng-
lishmen, that they wotild not lie close, tho' Old Friday told
them their saiely" depended upon it j and that if we had
patience, we should behold the savages kill one another.
However they used some caution, by going farther into
the woods, and placing themselves in a convenient place to behold the battle,
MNever could there be a more bloody engagement, or
went)? more invincible spirits and prudent conduct, ac-
cording to their manner and way of fighting. It lasted near
two hours, till the party which was nearest our castle began
to decline, and at last to fly from their conquerors. We
were undoubtedly put into a great consternation on this
account, lest they should run into our grove, and conse-
quently bring us into the like danger. Hereupon we re-
solved to kill the first that came, to prevent discovery, and
that too with our swords, and the butt end of our muskets,
tor fear the report of our guns should be heard.
"And so indeed, as we thought, it happened; for three of the vanquished army crossing the creek, ran directly to
the place, as to a thick wood for shelter; nor was it long
before our scout gave us notice of it; as also that, the vic-
tors did not think tit to pursue them. Upon this I would
not suffer them to be slain, but had them surprised and taken
by our party; afterwards they proved very good servants
to us, being stout young creatures, and able to do a great
deal of work. The remainder of the conquered savages
tied to their canoes, and put out into the ocean, while the
conquerors, joining together, shouted by way of triumph, O '.»
and about three in the afternoon they also embarked for
their own country. Thus we were freed at once from those
savages and our fears, not perceiving any of these creatures
for some considerable time after. We found two and thirty
men dead in the field of battle; some were slain with long
arrows, which we found sticking in their bodies; and the
rest were killed with great unweildy wooden swords, which
denoted their vast strength, and of which we found seven-
teen, besides bows and arrows: but we could not find one
wounded creature among them alive; for they either kill
their enemies quite,or carry those wounded away with them.
"This terrible sight tamed the Englishmen for some time,
considering how unfortunate thev might have been had they
fallen into their hands, who would not only kill them a?
enemies, but also for food, as we do cattle: and indeed so
much did this nauseate their stomachs, that it not only made
them very sick, but more tractable to the common necefsary
husinefs of the whole society, planting, sowing, and reap-
ing, with the greatest sign's of amity and friendship; so,
that being now all good friends, we began to consider of
circumstances in general; and the first thing we thought
of was, whether, as we perceived the savages haunted that
side of the island, and there being more retired parts of it,
and yet as well suited to our manner of living, and equally
to our advantage, we ought not rather to move our place
of residence, and plant it in a much safer place, both for
the security of our corn and cattle.
"After a lor.g deb:ite on this head, it was resolved, or
rather voted, nemine cmtradicente, not to remove our ancient
castle, and that for this very good reason, that some time
or other we expected to hear from our supreme governor,
(meaning you, Sir.) whose messengers not finding us there,
might think the place demolished, and all his subjects de-
stroyed by the savages.
"As to the next concern relating to our corn and cattle,
we consented to have them removed to the valley where
the cave was, that being most proper and sufficient for both.
Hut yet, when we considered farther, we altered one part
of our resolution, which was to remove part of our cattle
thither, and plant only part of our corn there; so that in
case one part was destroyed, the other might be preserved.
Another resolution we took, which really had a great deal
of prudence in it, and that was, in not trusting the three savages whom we had taken prisoners, with any knowledge
of the plantations we had made in the valley, of what num-
ber of cattle we had there, much less of the cave, wherein
we kept several arms, and two barrels of powder you left
for us at your departure from this island. But though we
could not change our habitation, we resolved to make it
more fortified and more secure. To this end, Sir, as you
planted trees at some distance before the entrance of your
palace; so we, imitating your example, planted and filled
up the whole space of ground, even to the banks of the
creek, nay, into the very ooze where the tide flowed, not
leaving a place for landing; and among those I had planted,
they had intermingled so many short ones, all of which
growing wonderfully fast and thick, a little dog could
scarcely find a passage through them. Nor was this suffi-
cient, as we thought, for we did the same to all the ground,
on the right and left hand of us, even to the top of the hill,
without so much as leaving a passage for ourselves, except
by the ladder, which being taken down, nothing but what had wings or witchcraft could pretend to come near us.
And indeed this was exceedingly well contrived, especially
to serve that occasion, for which we afterwards found it.
necefsary.
"Thus we lived two years in a happy retirement, hav-
ing, all this time, not one visit from the savages. Indeed
one morning we had an alarm, which put us in some amaze-
ment; for a few of my Spaniards being out very early,
perceived no less than twenty canoes, as it were, coming
on shore: upon which returning home with great precipi-
tation, they gave us the alarm, which obliged us to keep
at home all that day and the next, going out only in the
night-time to make our observations; but, as good luck
would have it, they were upon another design, and did not land that time upon the island.
"But now there happened another quarrel between the
three wicked Englishmen, and some of my Spaniards.—
The occasion was this: One of them being enraged at one
of the savages, whom he had taken prisoner, lor not being
able to comprehend something which he was showing him, snatched up a hatchet in a great fury, not to correct, but to
kill him; yet mifsing his head, gave him such a barbarous
cut in the shoulder, that he had like to have struck. $ff his
03
arm; at which one of my good-natured Spaniards toter-
po'.ing between the Englishman and the savage, beseechedthe former not to murder the poor creature; but this kind-
ue fs had like to have cost the Spaniard his life, for the
Englishman struck at him in the same manner; which he
nimbi)' and wisely avoided, returned suddenly upon him
with his shovel, (being all at workabout their corn land) and
very fairly knocked the brutish creature down. Hereupon,
another Englishman coming to his fellow's afsistance, laid the
good Spaniard on the earth; when immediately two others
coming to his relief, were attacked by the third Englishman,
armed with an old cutlass, who wounded them both. This
uproar soon reached our ears, when, we rushing out upon
them, took the three Englishmen prisoners, and then our next
question was, what should be done to such mutinous and
i'mpudent fellows, so furious, desperate, and idle, that they
were mischievous to the highest degree, and consequently
not safe for the society to let them live among them.
"Now, Sir, as I was governor in your absence, so I also
took the authority of a judge: and, having them brought
before me, I told them, that if they had been of my country,
I would have hanged every mother's son of them; but,
since it was an Englishman, (meaning you, kind Sir,) to
whom we were indebted for our preservation and deliver-
ance, I would, in gratitude, use them with all pofiible mild-
jiefs; but, at the same time, leave them to the judgment of
the other two Englishmen, who, I hoped, forgetting their
resentments, would deal impartially by them.
"Hereupon one of his countrymen stood up: "Sir,"
said he, "leave it not to us, for you may be sensible we
have reason to sentence them to the gallows: besides, Sir,
this fellow, Will Atkins, and the two others, proposed to us,
that we might murder you all in your sleep, which we could
not consent to: but knowing their inability, and your vigi-
lance, we did not think fit to discover it before now."
"Now, Seignior," said I, "do you hear what is alleged
against your What can you say to justify so horrid an action
as to murder us in cold blood?" So far, Sir, was the wretch
from denying it, that he swore, d—mn him but he would do
it still. "But what have we done to jou, Signior Atkins,"
said I; "or what will you gain by killing us? what shall
we do to prevent your Must we kill you, or you kill us?
why will you, Signior Atkins," said I, smiling, "put us to such an unhappy dilemma, such a fatal necefsity?" But so
great a rage did my scoffing and yet severe jest, put him
into, that he was going to fly at me, and undoubtedly had
attempted to kill me if he had been pofsefsed of weapons,
and had not been prevented by three Spaniards. This un-
paralleled and villanous carriage, made us seriously consider
what was to be done. The two Englishmen and the Spa-
niard, who had saved the poor Indian's life, mightily peti-
tioned me to hang one of them for an example to the others,
which should be him that had twice attempted to commit
murder with his hatchet, it being at that time thought im-
pofsible the poor slave should recover. But they could
never gain my consent to put him to death, for the reasons
above-mentioned, since it was an Englishman (even your-
self) who was my deliverer; and as merciful counsels are
most prevailing when earnestly prefsed, so I got them to be
of the same opinion as to clemency. But to prevent them
doing us any farther mischief, we all agreed, that they should
have no weapons, as sword, gun, powder, or shot, but be
expelled from the society, to live as they pleased by them-
selves; that neither the two Englishmen, nor the rest of the Spaniards, should have conversation with them upon any ac-
count whatsoever; that they should be kept from coming
within a certain distance of our castle; and if they dared
to offer us any violence, either by spoiling, burning, killing,
or destroying any of the corn, plantings, buildings, fences,
or cattle, belonging to the society, we would shoot them as
freely as we would do beasts of prey, in whatsoever places
we should find them.
"This sentence seemed very just to all but themselves;
when, like a merciful judge, I called out to the two honest
Englishmen, saying, " You must consider they ought not to
^ie starved,neither; and since it will be some time before they
can raise corn and cattle of their own, let us give them soma
corn to last them eight months, and for seed to sow, by which
time they'll raise some for themselves; let us also bestow
upon them six milch goats, four he ones, and six kids, as
well for their present support, as for a further increase:
with tools necessary for their work, as hatchets, an axe, saw,
and other things convenient to build them huts: all which
\vere agreed: but before they took them into pofsefsion, I
obliged them solemnly to swear, never to attempt anything
against us, or their countrymen, for the future. Thus dis-
mifsing them from our society, they went away, sullen and
refractory, as though neither willing to go nor stay; how-
ever seeing no remedy, they took what provision was given
them, proposing to choose a convenient place where the/
fliight live by themselves.
"About five days after, they came to those limits appoint-
ed, in order for more victuals, and sent me word by one of
my Spaniards, whom they called to, where they had pitched
their tents, and marked themselves out a habitation and
plantation, at the N. E. and most remote part of the island.
And, indeed, there they built themselves two very handsome
cottages, resembling our little castle, being under the side of
a mountain, with some trees already growing on three sides
of it; so that planting a few more, it would be obscured from
sight, unless particularly soughLfor. When these huts were
finished, we gave them some dry goat-skins for bedding and
covering; and upon their giving us fuller afsurances oi their
good behaviour for the future, we gave them some peas, bar-
ley, and rice for sowing, and whatever tools we could spare.
"Six months did'they live in this separate condition, in
which they got their first harvest in, the quantity of which
was but small, because they had planted but little land; for,
indeed, all their plantations being to form, made it more
difficult, especially as it was a thing out of their element; and when they were obliged to make their boards and pots,
&c. they could make little or nothing of it. But the rainy
season coming on, put them into a greater perplexity, for
want of a cave to keep their corn dry, and prevent it from
spoiling: and so much did this humble them, that they beg-
ged of my Spaniards to help them, to which the good-natured
men readily consented, and in four days space, worked a
great hole in the side of the hill for them, large enough for
their purpose, to secure their corn and other things from the
rain, though not comparable to ours, which had several ad-
ciitiona! apartments.
"But a new whim possessed these rogues about three
quarters of a year after, which had like to have ruined us,
and themselves too; for it seems, being tired and weary of
this sort of living, which made them work for themselves, without hopes of changing their condition, nothing would
serve them, but that they would make a voyage to the continent, and try if they could seize upon some of the savages,
and bring them over as s'aves, to do their drudgery, while they lived at ease and pltasure. ^
Indeed the project was not so preposterous, if they had
not gone farther; but they neither did, nor proposed any
thing, but what had mischief in the design, or the event.—One morning, these three fellows came down to the limited
station, and humbly desired to be admitted to talk with us,
which we readily granted; they told us, in short, that be-
ing tired of their manner of living, and the labour ot their
hands in such employments, not being sufficient to procure
the necefsaries of life, they only desired one of ihe canots
we came over in, with some arms and ammunition for their
defence, and they would seek their fortunes abroad, and
never trouble us any more. To be sure, we were glad
enough to get rid of such wretched plagues; but yet
honesty made us ingenuously represent to them, by what
we ourselves hadsufTered, the certain destruction they were
running into, either of being starved to death or murdered
by the savages. To this they very audaciously replied,
that they neither could nor would work; and consequently
that they might as well be starved abroad as at home;
and as to their falling into the hands of the savages, why, if
they were murdered, that was nothing to us, there was an
end of them: neither had they any wives or children to cry
after them: nay, so intent were they upon their voyage, that
if the Spaniards had not given them arms, so they had but
the canoe they would have gone without them.
"Though we could not well spare our fire-arms, rather
than they should go like naked men, we let them have two
muskets, a pistol, a cutlass, and three hatchets, which were
thought very sufficient; we gave them also goats' flesh, a
great basket full of dried grapes, a pot of tresh butter, a
young live kid, and a large canoe sufficient to carry twenty men. And thus, with a mast made of a long pole, and a
sail of six large goat-skins dried, having a fair breeze, and
flood-tide with them, they merrily sailed away, the Spa-
niards calling after them, Bon vejajo, no man ever expecting
to see them more."When they were gone, the Spaniards and Englishmen
would often say to one another, "O how peaceably do we
now live, since those turbulent fellows iiave left us!"—
Notffing could be farther from their thoughts than to behold
their faces any more; and yet scarce two and twenty days
had palscd over their heads, but one of the Englishmen, be-
ing abroad a planting, perceived, at a distance, three men,
l afro-fed, sppfoachtng towards him. Away he fiieS With

Pere they found the natives very courteous to them, giving
them several roots and dried fishf nay, even their women
too were willing to supply them with what they could
procure them to eat, bringing it a great way to them upon
their heads. Among those hospitable Indians they con-
tinued some days, inquiring, by signs and tokens, what na-
tions lay around them; and were informed, that there were
»everal fierce and terrible people lived every way, accus-
tomed to eat mankind; but for themselves they never used
such diet, except those that were taken in battle, |^$.<f
them they made a solemn feast.
"The Englishmen inquired how long it was since they
had a feast of that kind; They answered, about tw» o:to: •
at this time, their king had two hundred prisoners, which
were fattening up for the slaughter. The Englishmen
-were mighty desirous of seeing the prisoners, which the

bullets ; things which, tho* they were wholly ignorant of,
yet they seemed entirely contented with; ana dragging the
poor wretches into the boat, with their hands bound behind
them, delivered them to the Englishmen. 8«t this obliged
them to put off as soon as they had these presents, lest the
donors should have expected two or three of them to be
killed, and to be invited to dinner the next day; and «Q
taking leave with all possible respect and thanks, though
neither of them understood what the others said, they sailed
away back to the Just island, and there set eight of the
prisoners at liberty. In their voyage they endeavoured ta
t-'omjbrt, and have some conversation with the poor cap*
tivesj but it was impossible to make them sensible of any
thing j and nothing they could say or give, or do for thenif

j|?.«gbterj or looked at any one more particularly, the
poor creature supposed itself to be the first sacrifices and
even when we brought them to our island, and began to use them with the greatest humanity and kindness, yet they
expected every day that their new roasters wpula devour
them,
« And thus, Sir, did these three strange wanderers con.
slwcie their unaccountable relation of their vovuge, which
ti
was both amazing and entertaining. Hereupon, I asked them, where their new family was f They told me, they had
put them into one of their huts, and they came to beg some
victuals for them. This, indeed, made us all long to see
them; and taking Friday's father with us, leaving only two
at our castle, we came down to behold these poor creatures.
"When we arrived at the hut, (they being bound again
by the Englishmen, for fear of escaping) we found them
stark naked, expecting their fatal tragedy: they were
three lusty men, well shaped, with straight and good limbs,
between thirty and five and thirty years old; and five wo-
men, two of them might be from thirty to forty, two more
not above four andtwenty; and the last, a comely tall
maiden of about seventeen. Indeed, all the women were
very agreeable, both in proportion and features, except
that they were tawny, which their modest behaviour, and
other graces, made amends for, when they afterwards
came to be clothed.
"This naked appearance, together with their miserable
circumstances, was no very comfortable sight to my Spa-
niards, who, for their parts, I may venture, Sir, without
flatterv, to say, are men of the best behaviour, calmest
tempers, and sweetest nature, that can possibly be; for
they immediately ordered Friday's father to see if he knew
any of them, or if he understood what they could say.
No sooner did the old Indian appear, but he looked at
them with great seriousness; yet as they were not of his
nation, they were utter strangers to him, and none could
understaud'his speech or signs, but one woman. This was
enough to answer his design, which was to assure them
they would not be killed, being fallen into the hands of
Christians, who abhorred such barbarity. When they
were fully satisfied of this, they expressed their joy by such
strange gestures, and uncommon tones, as it is not possible for me to describe. But the woman, their interpreter, was
ordered next to inquire, whether they were content to be
servants, and would work for the men who had brought
them hither to save their lives? hereupon, (being at this
time unbound) they fella capering and dancing, one taking
this thing upon her shoulders, and the others that, intimat-
ing, that they were.willing to do any thing for them. But
iiow, Sir, having women amongst us, and dreading that
it might occasion some strife, if not blood, I asked lh« tlwte
men what they would do, and how they intended to use
these creatures, whether as servantsor women r Oneol them
very pertly and readily answered, they would use them as
both. Gentlemen, said I, as you are your own masters, I
am not going to restrain you from that; but, methiuks, lor
avoiding dissensions among you, I would only desire you to
engage, that none of you will take more than one fora wo-
man or wife, and that having taken this one, none else should
presume to touch her; for though we have not a priestly
authority to marry you, yet it is but reasonable, that who-
ever thus takes a woman, should be obliged to maintain her,
since nobody has any thing to do with her; and this, in-
deed,appeared so just to all present, that.it was unanimously
agreed to. The Englishmen then asked my Spaniards, whe-
ther they designed to take any of them? but they all an-
swered, No; some declaring they had already wives in
Spain; and others that they cared not to join with infidels.
On the reverse, the Englishmen took each of them a tem-
porary \vile, and so set up a new method of living. As to
Friday's father, the Spaniards, and the three savage servants
we had taken in the late battle, they all lived with me in
our ancient castle ; and indeed we supplied the main part
of the island with food, as necessity required. But the most
remarkable part of the story is, how these Englishmen, who
had been so much at variance, should agree about the choice
of those women; yet they took a way good enough to pre-
vent quarrelling among themselves. They set the five wo-
men in one of their huts, and going themselves to the other,
drew lots which should have the first choice. Now, he
that had the first lot went to the hut, and fetched out her -
lie chose; and it is remarkable, that he took her that was
the most homely and eldest of the number, which made the
rest of the Englishmen exceedingly merry; the Spaniards
themselves could not but smile'at it; but, as it happened,
the fellow had the best thought, in choosing one fit for ap-
plication and business; and, indeed, she proved the best
wife of all the parcel.
But when the poor creatures perceived themselves placed
in a row, and separated one by one, they were again seized
with an unspeakable terror, as now thinking they were going
to be slain in earnest; and when the Englishman came to
take the first, the rest set up a lamentable cry, clasped their
arms round her neck, and hanging about her, took their
1ast farewell, as they thought, in such trembling agonie<,
ai.d affectionate embraces, as would have softened the hard-
est heart in the world, and made the driest eyes melt into
tears; nor could they be persuaded but that they were going
to die, till such time as Friday's father made them sensible
that the Englishmen had chosen them for their wives, which
ended all their terror and concern upon this occasion.
"Well, after this, the Englishmen, went to work, and, be-
ing assisted by my good-natured Spaniards, in a few hours
they erected every one of them a new hut or tent for their
separate lodging, since those they had already were filled
vi ith tools, household stuff, and provision. They all con-
tinued on the north shore of the island, but separate as be-
for«; the three wicked ones pitched farther off, and the two
honest men nearer our castle; so that the island seemed to
be peopled in three places, three towns beginning to be built
for that purpose. And here I cannot but remark, what is
very common, that the two honest men had the worst wives,
(I mean as to industry, cleanlinefs, and ingenuity) while the
three reprobates enjoyed women of contrary qualities.
"But another observation I made was, in favour of the
two honest men, to show what disparity there is between a
diligent application to business, on the one hand, and a sloth-
ful, negligent, and idle temper, on the other. Both of
them had the same parcel of ground laid out, and corn to
sow sufficient for them; but both did not make the same
improvements, either in their cultivation or their planting.
The two honest men had a multitude of young trees planted
about their habitations, so that when you approached near
them, nothing appeared but a wood, very pleasing and de-
ligh f il. Every thing they did prospered and flourished;
their grapes planted in order, seemed as though managed in a vii e»ard, and were infinitely preferable to any of the others.
Nor were they wanting to find out a place of retreat, but
dug a cave in the most retired part of a thick wood, to se-
cure their wives and children, with their provision and chief-
tisi goods, surrounded with innumerable stakes, and having
a iro-tsub e entrance, in case any mischief should happen,
either from their fellow country men, or the devouring savages.
"As to the reprobates, (though I must own Uiey were
much more civilized than before) instead of adelightful wood
surrounding their dwellings, we found the words of Jung
Solomon too truly verified; "I went by the vineyard of the
"slothful, and it was all overgrown with thorns." In many
places their crop was obscured by weeds; the hedges having
several gaps in them, the wild goats had got in, and eaten up the corn, and here and there was a dead bush to stop
these gaps for the present, which was no more than shutting
the stable door after the steed was stolen away. But as to
their wives, they (as I observed before) were more diligent,
and cleanly enough, especially in their victuals, being in-
structed by one of the honest men, who had been a cook's
mate on board a ship: and very well it was so; for as he
cooked himself, his companion and their families lived as well as the idle husbands, who did nothing but loiter about,
.fetch turtle's eggs,catch fish and birds, and do any thing but
work, and lived accordingly; while the diligent lived very
handsomely and plentifully, in the most comfortable manner.
"And now, Sir, I come to lay before your eyes a scene
quite different from any thing that ever happened to us be-
fore, and perhaps ever befel you in all the time of your
residence on this island.' 1 shall inform you of its original
in the following manner: .
"One morning, Sir, very early, there came five or six
canoes of Indians on shore, indisputably upon their old cus-
tom of devouring their prisoners. All that we had to do
upon such an occasion, was to lie concealed, that they, not
having any notice of inhabitants, might depart quietly, after
performing their bloody execution: whoever first discovered
the savages, was to give notice to all the three plantations
to keep within doors, and then a proper scout was to be
placed to give intelligence of their departure. But, not-
withstanding these wise measures, an unhappy disaster dis-
covered us to the savages, which was like to have caused
the desolation of the whole island; for, after the savages
were gone off in their canoes, some of my Spaniards and I
looking abroad, and being inflamed w'uh. a curiosity to see
what they had been doing, to our great amazement beheld
three savages fast asleep on the ground, who, either being
gorged, could not awake when the others went off, or having
wandered too far into the woods, did not come back in time.
"What to do with them at first, we could not tell; as for
slaves we had enough of them already; and as to killing
them, neither Christianity nor humanity would sufler Hi to

shed the blood of persons who never did us wrong. We
perceived they had no boat left them to transport them to
their own nation; and that, by letting them wander about,
they might discover us, and inform ihe first savages that
should happen to land upon the same bloody occasion, which
information might entirely ruin us: and therefore I coun-
selled my Spaniards to secure them, and set them about some
work or other, till we could better dispose of them.
"Hereupon we all went back, and making them awake, took them prisoners. It is impossible to cxprcfs the horror
they were in, especially when bound, as thinking they were going to be murdered and eaten, but we soon cased them of
their fear as to that point. We first took them to the bower,
where the chief of our country'work lay, as keeping
planting corn, &c. and then carried them to the
lishmen's habitation, to help them in their bnsi
happy it was for us all we did not carry them to ousstle,
as by the sequel will appear. The Englishm
found them work to do; but whether they did not guard
them strictly, or that they thought they could not better them-
selves, I cannot tell; but certainly one of them ran away into
the woods, and t hey coulcl not hear of him for a long time after.
"Undoubtedly there was reason enough to suppose he got
home in some of the canoes, the savages returning in about
four weeks time, and going off in the space of two days. You may be certain, Sir, this thought could not but terrify
us exceedingly, and make us justly conclude, that the savage
would inform his countrymen of our abode in the island,
how few and weak we were in comparison to their numbers;
and we expected it would not be long before the English-
men would be attacked in their habitations: but the savages
had not seen their places of safety in the woods, nor our
• 'astfe, which it was a great happiness they did not know.
"Nor were we mistaken in our thoughts upon this oc-
casion; for about eight months after this, six canoes, with about ten men in each canoe, came sailing by the north-side
of Iheisland, which they were never accustomed to do'belore',
and landed about an hour after sunrise, near a mile from the
dwelling of the two Englishmen, who, it seems, had trw
good fortune to discover them about a league off: so that it
was an hour before they could attain the shore, and some
time longer before they could come at them. And now being comirwed in this opinion that they were certainly betrayed, they immediately bound the two slaves which were
left, causing two of the three men, whom they brought with the women, and who proved very faithful, to lead them with
their wives, and other conveniences, into their retired cave
in the wood,and there to bind the two fellows hand and
foot, till they had further orders. They then opened their
fences, where they kept their milch goats, and drove them
all out, giving the goats liberty to ramble in the woods, to
make the savages believe that they were wild ones; but the
slave had given a truer information, which made them come
to the very inclosures. The two frightened men sent the
other slave of the three, who had been with them by acci-
dent, to alarm the Spaniards, and desire their assistance; in
the mean time they took their arms and ammunition, and
made to the cave where they had sent their wives, and se-
curing their slaves, seated themselves in a private place, from whence they might behold all the actions of'the savages.
Nor had they gone far, when, ascending a rising ground,
they.could see a little army of Indians approach to their
beautiful dwelling, and in a few moments more, perceive
the same, and their furniture, to their unspeakable grief, burning in a consuming flame: and when this was done,
they spread here and there, searching every bush and place
for the people, of whom it was evident they had information.
Upon which the two Englishmen, not thinking themselves
secure where they stood, retreated about half a mile higher
in the country, rightly concluding, that the farther the
savages strolled, there would be less numbers together: upon
which they next took their stand by the trunk of an old tree,
very hollow and large, whence they resolved to see what
would offer; but they had not stood long there, before two
savages came running directly towards them, as though having knowledge of their being there, who seemed resolved
to attack them; a little farther were three more, and five
more behind them again, all running the same way. It
cannot be imagined the perplexity the poor men were in at
this sight, thinking that if afsistance did not speedily come,
their cave in the wood would be discovered, and consequentlv .
all therein lost; so they resolved'to resist them there, and,
when overpowered, to ascend to the top of the 'trees, where
they might defend themselves as long as their ammunition
lasted, and sell their lives as dear as pofsible to those
P3
devouring savages. Thus fixfid in their resolution, they
next considered, whether they should fire at the first two, or
wait for the three, and so take the middle party, by which
the two first and the five last would be separated. In this
regulation the two savages also confirmed them, by turning
a little to another part of the wood; but the three, and the
five alter them, came directly towards the tree. Hereupon
they resolved to take them in a direct line, as they approach-
ed nearer, because, perhaps, the first shot might hit them all
three; and upon this occasion, the man who was to fire,
charged his piece with three or four bullets. And thus
while they were waiting, the savages came on, one of them
was the runaway, who had caused all the mischief: so they
resolved he should not escape, if they both fired at once.
But, however, though they did not fire together, they were
ready charged; when the first that let fly, was too good a
marksman to miss his aim; for he killed the foremost out-
-right, the second (who was the runaway Indian) fell to the
ground, being shot through the body, but not dead, and the
third was a little wounded in the shoulder, who, sitting
down on the ground, fell a screaming in a most fearful man-
ner. The noise of the guns, which not only made the most
resounding echoes, from one side to the other, but raised
the birds of all sorts, fluttering with the most confused noise,
so much terrified the five savages behind, that they stood
still at first, like so many inanimate images. But when all
things were in profound silence, they came to the place where
their companions lay; and here, not being sensible that
they were liable to the same late, stood over the wounded
man, undoubtedly inquiring the occasion of this calamity;
and'tis as reasonable to suppose, he told them,that it came
by thunder and lightning from the gods, having never seen
or heard of a gun before, in the whole course of their lives.
By this time the Englishmen, having loaded their pieces,
iired both together a second time, when seeing them all fall
immediately on the ground, they thought they had killed
every creature of them. This made them come up boldly
before they had charged their guns, which, indeed, was a
wrong step; for, when they came to the place, they found
four alive, two of them very little wounded, and one not at
all, which obliged them to fall upon them with their muskets;
they first knocked the runaway savage on the head, and another that was but little wounded in the arm, and then 
put the other languishing wretches out of their pain; while
he that was not hurt, with bended knees and uplift hands, made piteous moans and signs to them to spare his life;
nor, indeed, were they unmerciful to the poor wretch, but
pointing to him to sit down at the foot of a tree hard by: and
then, one of the Englishmen, with a piece of rope twine he
had in his pocket, by mere chance, tying his feet fast to-
gether, and his two hands behind him, they left him there,
making all the haste they could after the othertwo, fearing
they should find out their cave; but though they could not
overtake them, they had the satisfaction to perceive them
at a distance cross a valley, towards the sea, a quite con-
trary way to their retreat; upon which they returned to the
tree, to look after their prisoner; but when they came there
he was gone, leaving the piece of rope-yarn, wherewith he
was bound, behind him.
"Well, now they were as much concerned as ever,-as
not knowing how near their enemies might be, or in what
numbers. Immediately they repaired to the cave, to see it'
.all was well there, and found every thing safe, except the
women, who were frightened upon their husbands' account,
whom they now loved entirely. They had not been long
here, before seven of my Spaniards came to assist them;
while the other ten, their servants, and Friday's father, were
gone to defend their bower, corn, and cattle, in case the
savages should have rambled so far. There accompanied
the seven Spaniards, one of the three savages that had for-
merly been taken prisoner; and with them also that very
Indian whom the Englishmen had, a little before, left under
the tree; for it seems, they passed by that way where the
slaughter was made, and so carried along with them that
poor wretch that was left bound. But so many prisoners
now becoming a burden to us, and fearing the dreadful
consequence of their escaping, most of the Spaniards and
English urged the absolute nectfsity there was of killing
them for our common preservation; but, Sir, the authority
I bore, as governor, over-ruled that piece of cruelty; and
- then I ordered them to be sent prisoners to the old cave in
the valley, bound hands and feet, with two Spaniards to
guard them.
^ "So much encouraged were the Englishmen at the ap-
'proach of the Spaniards, andso great were their fury against the savages for destroying their habitations, that thev had
not patience to stay any longer; but, taking five Spaniards
along with them, armed with four muskets, a pistol, and a
quarter-staff, away they went in pursuit of their enemies.
As they passed by the place where the savages were slain,
it was very easy to be perceived that more of them had
been there, having attempted to carry off their dead bodies,
but found it impracticable. From a rising ground, our party
had the mortification to see the smoke that proceeded from
the ruins; when coming farther in sight of the shore, they
plainly perceived that the savages had embarked in their
canoes, and were putting out to sea. This they were very
sorry for, there being no coming at them to give them a
parting salute; but, however, they were glad enough to
get clear of such unwelcome guests.
"Thus the two honest, but unfortunate Englishmen, be-
ing ruined a second time, and their improvements quite de-
stroyed, most of my good-natured Spaniards helped them to rebuild, and we all assisted them with needful supplies; nay,
what is more remarkable, their three mischievous country-
men, when they heard of it, (which was after all these disasters
were over, they living more remote eastward) very friendly
sympathized with them, and worked for them several days;
so that in all ttle their habitations were rebuilt, their necefsities -
supplied, and themselves restored to their former tranquillity.
"Though the savages had nothing to boast of in this ad-
venture, (several canoes being driven ashore, followed by
two drowned creatures, having undoubtedly met with a storm at sea, that very night they departed) yet it was natural
to be supposed, that those whose better fortune it was to
attain their native shore, would inflame their nation to
another ruinous attempt, with a greater force to carry all
before them. And, indeed, so it happened: for about seven
months after, our island was invaded with a most formidable
navy, no less than eight andtwenty canoes full of savages, armed with wooden swords, monstrous clubs, bows and
arrows, and such like instruments of war, landing at the
east-end of the island.
"You may well, Sir, imagine, what consternation our
men were in upon this account, and how speedy they were
to execute their resolution, having only that night's time
allowed them. They knew, that since they could not with-
stand their enemies, concealment was the only way to pro-
cure their safety; and, therefore, they took down the huts that were built for the two Englishmen, and drove their
flock of goats, together with their own at the bower, to the
old cave in the valley, leaving as little appearance of in-
habitants as possible; and then posted themselves, with all
their force, at the plantation of the two men. As they ex-
pected, so it happened; for early the next morning, the
Indians, leaving their canoes at the east-end of the island,
came running alongthe shore, about two hundred and fifty
in number, as near as could be'guefsed. Our army was but
little indeed; and what was our greatest misfortune, we had
not arms sufficient for them. The account, as to the men,
Sir, isas follows: viz. 17 Spaniards, .5 Knelishmen, old Fri-
day, the three savages, taken with the five women, who
proved faithful servants, and three other slaves, living with
the Spaniards. To arm these, they had 11 muskets, 5 pis-
tols, 3 fowling-pieces, 2 swords, 3 old halberts, 5 muskets,
or fowling-pieces, taken from the sailors whom you reduced.
As to the slaves, we gave three of them halberts, and the
other, three long staves, with great iron spikes at the end
of them, with hatchets by their sides; we also had hatchets
sticking in our girdles, besides the fire arms; nay, two of
the women, inspired with Amazonian fortitude, could not
bo difiuadcd from fighting along with their dear husbands, and if they died, to die with them. Seeing their resolution,
we gave them hatchets likewise; but what pleased them best, were the bows and arrows (which they dexterously
knew how to use) that the Indians had left behind them,
after their memorable battle one against another.
"Over this army, which, though little, was of great in-
trepiditv, I was constituted chief general and commander;
and knowing Will Atkins, though exceedingly wicked, yet
a man of invincible courage, I gave him the power of com-
manding under me; he had six men with their muskets
loaded with six or seven bullets a piece, and were planted
just behind a small thicket of bushes, as an advanced guard,
having orders to let the first pafs by; and then, when he
lired into the middle of them, make a nimble retreat round
a part of the wood, and so come in the rear of the Spaniards,
who were shaded by a thicket of.trees: for, though the sa-
.vages came on with the fierceneis of lions, yet they wanted
the subtilty of foxes, being out of all manner of order, and
straggling in heaps every way; and, indeed, when Witt
Sj after fifty of the savages had passed by, had ordered three of his men to give fire, so great was their consterna-
tion, to see so many men killed and wounded, and hear such
3 dreadful noise, and yet knew not whence it came, that
they were frightened to the highest degree ;- and when the second volley was given, they concluded no less but that
their companions were slain by thunder and lightning from
Heaven. In this notion they would have continued, had
Will Atkins and his men retired, as soon as they had fired,
according to order; or had the rest been near them to pour
in their shot continually, there might have been a complete
victory obtained; but staying to load their pieces agaiiv
discovered the whole matter. They were perceived by
some of the scattering savages at a distance, w.ho let fly their
arrows among them, wounded Atkins himselfrand killed his
fellow Englishman, and one of the Indians taken with the
women. Our party did not fail to answer them, and in their
retreat killed about twenty savages. Here I cannot but
take notice of our poor dying slave, who, though stopt from his retreat by a fatal arrow, yet with his staff and hatchet
desperately and gallantly assailed his pursuers, and killed.
five of the savages before his life submitted to a multiplicity of wounds. Nor is the cruelty or malice of the Indians to
be less remarked, in breaking the arms, legs, and heads of
the two dead bodies, with their clubs and wooden swords,
after a most wretched manner. As Atkins retreated, our
party advanced, to interpose between him and the savages:
but, after three vollies, we were obliged to retreat also;
for they were so numerous and desperate, that they came
up to our very teeth, shot their arrows like a cloud, and
their wounded men enraged with cruel pain, fought like
madmen. They did not, however, think fit to follow us, but
drawing themselves up in a circle, they gave two triumphant
shouts in token of victory, though they had the grief to see
several of their wounded men bleed to death before them.
"After I had, Sir,drawn up my little army together, upon
a rising ground, Atkins, wounded as he was, would have
had us attack the whole body of the savages at once. I
was extremely well pleased with the gallantry of the man:
but upon consideration, I replied, " You perceive, Seig-
"nior Atkins, how their wounded men fight, let them
alone till morning, when they will be faint, stiff, and sore,.
** and then we shall have fewer to combat with." To
which Atkins, smiling, replied, "That's very true, Seig-
"nior, so sliall I too; and that's the reason I would fight
"them now I am warm." We all answered, Seignior
Atkins for your part, you have behaved very gallantly; and
ifyou are not able to approach the enemy in the morning,
we will fight for you, till then we think it convenient to
wait, and so we tarried.
"By the brightness of the moon that night, we perceived
the savages in great disorder about their dead and wounded
men. This made us change our resolution, and resolve to
fall upon them in the night, if we could give them one vol-
ley undiscovered. This we had a fair opportunity to do,
by one of the two Englishmen leading us round, between
the woods and the sea-side westward, and turning short
south, came privately to a place where the thickest of them
were. Unheard and unperceived, eight of us fired among
them, and did dreadful execution; and in half a minute
after, eight more of us let fly, killing and wounding abund-
ance of them; andthen dividing ourselves into three bodies,
eight persons in each body, we marched from among the
trees, to the very teeth of the enemy, sending forth the
greatest shouts and acclamations. The savages hearing a
.different noise from three quarters at once, stood in the
utmost confusion; but coming in sight of us, let fly a volley
of arrows, which wounded poor old Friday, yet happily it
did not prove mortal. We did not, however, give them a
second opportunity; but rushing in among them, we fired
three several ways, and then fell to work with our swords,
staves, hatchets, and the butt end of our muskets, with a
fury not to be resisted; so that, with the most dismal scream-
ing and howling, they had recourse to their feet, to save their
lives by a speedy flight. Nor must we forget the valour
of the two women; for they exposed themselves to the
greatest dangers, killed many with their arrows, and va-
liantly destroyed several more with their hatchets.
"In fighting these two battles, we were so much tired,
that we did not then trouble ourselves to pursue them to
their canoes, in which we thought they would presently
put to the ocean; but there happening a dreadful storm at
sea, which continuing all that night, it not only prevented their
voyage, but dashed several of their boats to pieces against
the beach, and drove the rest so high upon the shore, that it
required infinite labour to get them off. After our men had
taken some refreshment and a little repose, they resolved
6
early in the morning to go towards the place of their land-
ing, and see whether they were gone off, or in what posture
they remained. This necessarily led them to the place of
battle, where several of the savages were expiring, a sight
no way pleasing to generous minds, to delight in misery,
though obliged to conquer them by the law of arms; but
our own Indian slaves put them out of their pain, bv de-
spatching them with their hatchets. At length coming in
view of the remainder of the army, we found them leaning
upon their knees, which were bended toward their mouth, and the head between the two hands. Hereupon, coming
within musket-shot of them, I ordered two pieces to be fired
without ball, in order to alarm them, that we might plainly
know, whether they had the courage to venture another
battle, or were utterly dispirited from such an attempt, tliat
so we might accordingly manage them. And, indeed, the
project took very weli; for, no sooner did the savages hear
the first gun, and perceive the flash of the second, but they
suddenly started upon their feet, in the greatest conster-
nation; and when we approached towards them, they ran
howling and screaming away up the hill into the country.
"We could rather, at first, have wished that the weather
had permitted them to have gone ott'to the sta; but when
we consider that their escape might occasion the approach
of multitudes, to our utter ruin and desolation, we were
very well pleased the contrary happened: Will Atkins
(who, though wounded, would not part from us all this while)
advised us not to let slip this advantage, but clapping be-
tween them and their boats, deprive them of the capacity
of ever returning to plague the island: "1 know," said he,
"there is but one objection you can make, which is, that
these creatures living like beasts in the woods, may make
excursions, ritle the plantations, and destroy the tame
"goals; but then, consider, we had better to do with an
"hundred men, whom we can kill, or make slaves of at
leisure, than with an hundred nations, whom it is ira-
"pofsible we should save ourselves from, much lefs sub-
"due." This advice, and these arguments being approved
of, we set fire to their boats; and though they were so wet
that we could not burn them entirely, yet we made them
incapable for swimming in the seas. As soon as the Indians
perceived what we were doing, many of them ran out of the
woods, in sight oi us and kneeling down, pitcously cried out,
Oa, Oa, Waramalma. Intimating, Isuppose, that, if we would
but spare their canoes, they would never trouble us again.
"But all their complaints, submissions, and entreaties,
were in vain; for self-preservation obliging us to the con-
trary, we destroyed every one of them that had escaped the
fury of the ocean. When the Indians perceived this, they
raised a lamentable cry, and ran into the woods, where they continued ranging about, making the woods ring with their
lamentations. Here we should have considered, that making these creatures thus desperate, we ought, at the same time,
to have set a sufficient guard upon the plantations: for the
savages, in their ranging about, found out the bower, destroyed the fences, trod the corn down under their feet, aiul
tore up the vines and grapes. It is true, we were always
able to fight these creatures; but as they were too swift for
us, and very numerous, we durst not go out single, for fear
of them; though that too was needles*, they having nt
weapons, nor any materials to make them: and indeed, their extremity appeared in a little time after.
"Though the savages, as already mentioned, had de-
stroyed our bower, and all our corn, grapes, &c. yet we
had still left our stock of cattle in the valley, by the cave,
witli some little corn that grew there, and the plantation of Will Atkins and his companions, one of whom being killed by an arrow, they were now reduced to two: it is renjd.k-
u'jie ttiat this was the fellow who cut the poor Indian witn
his hatchet, and had a design to murder me and my coun-
trymen the Spaniards. As our condition was so loyv, we
came to the resolution to drive thesavages up to the iarther
part of the island, where no Indians landed; to kill as many
of them as we could, till we had reduced their number; and then to give the remainder some corn toplant, and to teach them how to live by their daily labour. Accordingly we
pursued them with our guns, at the hearing of which they were so terrified, that they would iall to the ground.
Evvry day we killed and wounded some of them, and many
were found starved to death, so that our hearts began tore-
ii..nt at the sight of such miserable objects. At last, witlj
great difficulty, taking one of them alive, and using him
with kindness, and tenderness, we brought him to old Fri-
day, who talked to him, and told him how good we would
be to them all, giving them corn and land to plant and live
in, and present nourishment, provided they should keep Q
within such bounds as should be allotted them, and not do
prejudice to others: "Go then," said he, "and inform
your countrymen of this; which, if they will not agree to,
every one of them shall be slain."
"The poorcreatures, thoroughly humbled, being reduced
to about thirty-seven, joyfully accepted the offer, and earn-
estly begged for food; hereupon we sent twelve Spaniards
and two Englishmen, well armed, together with old Friday,
and three Indian slaves were loaded with a large quantity
of bread and rice cakes, with three live goats: and the
poor Indians being ordered to sit down on the side of the
hill, they ate the victuals very thankfully, and have proved
faithful to the last, never trespassing beyond their bounds,
where at this day they quietly and happily remain, and
where we now and then visit them. They are confined to
n neck of land about a mile and a half broad, and three or
four in length, on the south.east corner of the island, the
sea being before, and lofty mountains behind them, free
from the appearance of canoes; and indeed their country-
men never made any inquiry after them. We gave them
twelve hatchets, and three or four knives; have taught
them to build huts, make wooden spades, plant corn, make
bread, breed tame goats and milk them, as likewise to make
wicker-work, in which, I must ingenuouslv confess, they
infinitely outdo us, having made themselves several pretty
necessaries and fancies, as baskets, sieves, birdcages, and
cupboards, as also stools, beds, and couches, no less useful
than delightful; and now they live the most innocent and
inoffensive creatures that ever were subdued in the world,
wanting nothing but wives to make them a nation.
"Thus, kind Sir, have I given you, according to my
ability an impartial account of the various transactions that
have happened in the island since your departure, to this
day; and we have great reason to acknowledge the kind
providence of Heaven in our merciful deliverance. When
you inspect your little kingdom, you will find in it some
little improvement, your flocks increased, and your subjects
augmented, so that from a desolate island, as this was before
your wonderful deliverance upon it, here is a visible pros-
pect of its becoming a populous and well governed little
kingdom, to your immortal fame and glory."
There is no doubt to suppose but that the preceding re-
lation of my faithful Spaniard was very agreeable, and no less surprising to me, to the young priest, and to all who
heard it: nor were these people less pleased with those necessary utensils that I brought them, such as the knives,
scissars, spades, shovels, and pick-axes, with which they
now adorned their habitations.
So much had they addicted themselves to wicker-work,
prompted by the ingenuity of the Indians, who assisted them,
that when I viewed the Englishmen's colonies, they seemed
at a distance as though they had lived like bees in a hive:
it.iT Will Atkins, who has now become a very industrious
and sober man, had made himself a tent of basket-work
round the outside; the walls were worked in as a basket,
in pannels or strong squares of thirty-two in number, stand-
ing about seven leet high: in the middle was another, not
above twenty-two paces round, but much stronger built, being of an octagonal form, and in the eight corners stood
eight strong posts, round the top of which he laid strong
pieces, pinned with wooden pins, from which he raised a pyramid for the roof, mighty pretty, I assure you, and joined
very well together with iron spikes, which he made him-
self; for he had made him a forge, with a pair of wooden
bellows, and charcoal for his work, forming an anvil out of one of the iron crows, to work upon, and in this manner
would he make himself hooks, staples, spikes, bolts, and
hinges. After he had pitched the roof of his innermost tent,
he made it so rirm between the rafters with basket-work,
thatching that over again with rice-straw, and over that a
large leaf of a tree, that his house was as dry as if it had
been tiled or slated. The outer circuit was covered as a
lean-to, quite round this innerapartment, laying long rafters
from the thirty-two angles to the top posts of the inner
house, about twenty feet distant, so that there was a space
like a wall between the outer and inner wall, near twenty
leet in breadth. The inner place he partitioned off with
the same wicker-work, dividing it into six neat apartments,
every one of which had a door, first into the entry of the
main tent, and another into the space and walk that was
round it, not only convenient for retreat, but for family ne-
cessaries. Within the door of the outer circle, there was a
passage directly to the door of the inner-house; on either
side was a wicker partition, and a door, by which you got
into a room twenty-two feet wide, and about thirty long, Qa
and through that into another of a smaller length; so that ia
the outer circle were ten handsome rooms, six of which
were only to be come at through the apartments of the in-
ner tent, serving as retiring rooms to the respective cham-
bers of the inner circle, and four large warehouses, which
went in through one another, two on either hand of the
passages that led through the outer door to the innertent.—
In short nothing could be built more ingeniously, kept more
neat, or have better conveniences; and here lived the
three families, Will Atkins, his companion, their wives and
children, and the widow of the deceased. As to religion,
the men seldom taught their wives the knowledge of God,
any more than the sailor's custom of swearing by his name.
The greatest improvement their wives had, was, they
taught them to speak English, so as to be understood. None of their children were then above six years old;
they were all fruitful enough, and I think the cook's mate's
wife was big of her sixlh .child.
When I inquired of the Spaniards about their circum.
Ktances while among the savages, they told me, that they
abandoned themselves to despair, reckoning themselves a
poor and miserable people, that had no means put into their
hands, and consequently must soon be starved to death.—They owned, however, that they were in the wrong to think
so, and for refusing the assistance that reason offered for
their support, as well as future deliverance, confessing that
grief was a most insignificant passion, as it looked upon
things as without remedy, and having no hope of things to
come; all which verified this noted proverb,
In trouble to he'troohled,
Is to have your troubte doubted.
Nor did these remarks end here; for, making observa-
tions upon my improvement, and on my condition at first,
infinitely worse than theirs, he told me, that Englishmen
had, in their distress, greater presence of mind than those
of any other country that he had met with; and that they
and the Portuguese were the worst men in the world to
struggle under misfortunes. When they landed among the
savages, they found but little provision, except they would
turn cannibals, there being but a few roots and herbs, witu
lutle substance in them, and of which the natives gave them
But very sparingly. Many were the ways they took to
tivilize and teach the savages, but in vain; for they would
not own them to be their instructors, whose lives were ow-
ing to their bounty. Their extremities were very great,
being many days entirely without food, the savages there
being more indolent and less devouring than those who
had better supplies. When they went out to battle they
were obliged to assist these people, in one of which my
faithful Spaniard being taken, had like to have been de-
voured. They had lost their ammunition, which rendered
their fire-arms useless; nor could they use the bows and
arrows that were given them, so that while the armies were
at a distance they had no chance, but when close, then they
could be of service with halbsrts,-and sharpened sticks put
into the muzzles of their muskets. They made themselves
targets of wood, covered with the skins of wild beasts; an:l
when one happened to be knocked down, the rest of the
company fought over him till he recovered : and then stand-
ing close in a line, they would make their way through a
thousand savages. At the return of their friends, who they
thought had been entombed in the bowels of their enemies,
their joy.was inconceivable. Nor were they less surprised
at the sight of the loaves of bread I had sent them, things
that they had not seen for several years, at the same time crossing and blessing it, as though it was manna sent from Heaven: but when they knew the errand, and perceived
the boat which was to carry them to the person and place
from whence such relief came, this struck them with such
a surprise of joy as maue some of them .faint away, and
others burst out into tears.
This was the summary account that I had from them.—
I shall now inform the reader what I next did for them, and
in what condition I left them. As we were all of opinion
that as the savages would scarce trouble them any more, so
we had no apprehensions on that score. I told them I was
come purely to establish, and not to remove them; and
upon that occasion, had not only brought them necessaries
for convenience and defence, but also artificers, and other
persons, both for their necessary employments, and to add
toiheir number. They were all together when I thus talked
to them; and before I delivered to them the stores I brought,
I asked them one by one, if they had entirely forgot theic..
Q3 '.
tifit animosities, would engage in the strictest friendship,
and shake hands with one another? On this Will Atkins,
with abundance of good humour, said, they had afflictions
enough to make them all sober, and enemies enough to
make them all friends: as for himself he would live and
die among them, owning that what the Spaniards had done
to him, his own mad humour had made necessary for them
to do. Nor had the Spaniards occasion to justify their pro-
ceedings to me; but they told me, that since Will Atkins
had behaved himself so valiantly in fight, and at other times
showed such a regard to the common interest of them all,
they had not only forgotten all that was past, but thought
he ought as much to be trusted with arms and necessaries
as any of them, which they tesiified by making him next in
command to the governor: and they most heartily embraced
the occasion of giving me this solemn assurance, that they
would never separate their interest again as long as they lived.
After these kind declarations of friendship, we appointed
all of us to dine together the next day; upon this I caused
the ship's cook and his mate to come on shore for that pur-
pose, to assist in dressing our dinner. We brought from
the ship six pieces of beef, and four of pork, together with
our punch-bowl, and materials to fill it; and in particular I
gave them ten bottles of French claret, and ten of English
beer, which was very acceptable to them. The Spaniards
added to our feast five whole kids, which being roasted,
three of them were sent as fresh meat to the sailors on board,
and the other two we eat ourselves. After our merry and
innocent feast was over, I began to distribute my cargo
among them. First, I gave them linen sufficient to make
every one of them four shirts, and at the Spaniard's request
made them up six. The thin English. stuffs 1 allotted to
make every one a light coat like a frock, agreeable to th«
climate., and left them such a quantity as to make more upon
their decay; as also pumps, shoes, hats, and stockings. It
is not to be expressed the pleasing satisfaction which sat
upon the countenances of these poor men, when they per-
ceived what care I took of them, asifl had been a common
inther to them all; and they all engaged never to leave the
island, till I gave my consent for their departure. I then
prest-'nted U> them the people I brought, viz. the tailor,
smith, and the two carpenters; but my Jack-of-all-Trades
was the most acceptable present I could make them. Mjr
tailor fefl hnmediately to work, and made every one of them
a shirt; after which, he learned j^e-women how to sew and
stitch, thereby to become the moFe helpful to their husbands.
Neither were the carpenters less useful, taking in pieces their
clumsy things; instead of which they made convenient and
handsome tables, stools, bedsteads, cupboards, lockers, and
shelves. But when I carried them to see Will Atkins's
basket-house, they owned they never saw such a piece of
natural ingenuity before: "I am sure," said one of the car-
penters, " the man that built this has no need of us; you
"'need, Sir, do nothing but give him tools."
I divided the tools among them in this manner: to every
man I gave a digging spade, a shovel, and a rake, as having
no harrows or ploughs; and to every separate place a pick-
-axe, a crow, a broad ax, and a saw, with a store for a general
supply, should any be broken or worn out. I left them also
nails, staples, hinges, hammers, chissels, knives, scissars, and
all sorts of tools and iron work; and for the use of the
smith, gave them three tons of unwrought iron, for a sup-
ply; and as to arms and ammunition, I stored them even to
profusion; or at least, to equip a sufficient little army
against all opposers whatsoever.
The young man (whose mother was unfortunately starved
to death) together with.the maid, a pious and well educated
young woman, seeing things so well ordered on shore, (for
I made them accompany me) and considering they had no
occasion to go so far a voyage as to the East-Indies, they
both desired of me, that I would leave them there, and
enter them among my subjects. This I readily agreed to,
ordering them a plat of ground, on which were three little
houses erected, environed with basket-work, pallisadoed
like Atkins's, andadjoining to his plantation. So contrived
were their tents, that each of them had a room apart to
lodge in, while their middle tent was not only their store-
-house, but their place for eating and drinking. At this
time the two Englishmen removed their habitation to their
former place; so that now the island was divided into three
colonies: first, Those I have just now mentioned; secondly,
That of Will Atkins, where there were four families of
Englishmen, with their wives and children, the widow and
her children; the young man and the maid, who, by the
way, we made a wife of before our departure; three sa-
vages, who were slaves; the tailor, smith, (who served also as a gunsmith) and my other celebrated person called Jatkr-
of-all-Trades: Thirdly, My chief colony, which consisted of
the Spaniards with Old Friday, who still remained at my
old habitation, which was my capital city; and surely never
was there such a metropolis, it being now hid in so obscure
a grove, that a thousand men might have ranged the island
a month, and looked purposely for it, without being able to
find it, though the Spaniards had enlarged its boundaries,.
bolh without and within, in a most surprising manner.
But now I think it high time to speak of the young French
priestoftheorderofSt. Benedict, whose judicious and pious
discourses, upon sundry occasions, merit an extraordinary
observation; nor can his being a French papist priest, I pre-
sume, give offence to any of my readers, when they have
this assurance from me, that he was a person of a most
courteous disposition, extensive charity, and exalted piety.
His arguments were always agreeable to reason, and his
conversation the most acceptable of any person that I had
ever yet met with in my life."Sir," said he, to me, one day, "since, under God,"
at the same time crossing his breast, "you have not only
.saved my life; but by permitting me to go this voyage,
have granted me the happiness of free conversation, I
think it my duty, as my profession obliges me, to save
what souls I can, by bringing them to the knowledge of
some catholic doctrine, necessary to salvation; and since
these people are under your immediate government, in
gratitude, justice, and decency, for what you have done
for me, I shall offer no farther points in religion, than
what merit your approbation." Being pleased with the
modesty of his carriage, I told him he should not be worse
used for being of a different persuasion, if upon that very
account we did not differ in points of faith, not decent in
a part of the country where the poor Indians ought to be
instructed in the knowledge of the true God, and his Son
Jesus Christ. To this he replied, that conversation might
easily be separated from disputes; that he would discourse
with me rather as a gentleman than on religion; but that,
if we did enter upon religious arguments, upon my desiring
the same, I would give him liberty to defend his own prin-
ciples. He farther added, that he would do all that became
him in his office, as a priest as well as a Christian, to pro-
core the happiness of all that were in the ship: that though he could not pray with, he would pray for us on all occa-
sions; and then he told me several extraordinary events of
his lite, within a few years past; but particularly in this last, which was the most remarkable: that in this voyage,
he had the misfortune to be five times shipped and unshipped:
his first design was to have gone to Martinico; for which
taking ship at St. Maloes, he was forced into Lisbon by bad
weather, the vessel running a-ground in the mouth of the
Tagus; that from thence he went on board a Portuguese
ship, bound to the Madeiras, whose master being but an in-
different mariner, and out of his reckoning, they were drove
to Fial, where selling their commodity, which was corn, they
resolved to take in their loading at the isle of May, and to
sail to Newfoundland; at the Banks of which, meeting a
French ship bound to Quebec, in the river of Canada, and
from thtnce to Martinico, in this ship he embarked; the
master of which dying at Quebec, that voyage was sus-
pended; and lastly shipped himself for France, this last
ship was destroyed by fire, as before has been related.
At this time we talked no further; but another morning
he comes to me, just as I was going to visit the English-
men's colony, and tells me, that as he knew the prosperity
of the island was my principal desire, he had something to
communicate agreeable to my design, by which perhaps he might put it, more than he yet thought it was, in the way
of the benediction of Heaven. "How, Sir!" said I, in a
surprise, "are we not yet in the way of God's blessings,
after all these signal providences and deliverances, of which
you have had such an ample relation?" He replied, " I hope,
Sir, you are in the way, and that your good design will
prosper: but still there are some among you that are not
equally right in their actions; and remember, I beseech
you, Sir, that Achan, by his crime, removed God's blessing
from the camp of the children of Israel; that though six
and thirty were entirely innocent, yet they became the ob-
jects of divine vengeance, and bore the weight of his punish-
ment accordingly." So sensibly was I touched with this discourse, and so sa-
tisfied with that ardent piety that inflamed his soul, that I
desired him to accompany me to the Englishmen's planta-
tions, which he was very glad of, by reason they were the
subject of what he designed to discourse with me about:
and while we walked on together, he began in the follow-
ing manner:
"Sir, said he, I must confess it is a great unhappiness
that we disagree in several doctrinal articles of religion; but
surely both of us acknowledge this, that there is a God,
who having given us some stated rules for our service and
obedience, we ought not willingly and knowingly to offend
him; either by neglecting what he has commanded, or by
doing what he has forbidden. This truth every Christian
owns, that when any one presumptuously sins against God's
command, the Almighty then withdraws his blessing from
him; every good man therefore ought certainly to prevent
such neglect of, or sin against, God and his commands. I
thanked the young priest for expressing so great a concem
<or us, and desired him to explain the particulars of what
he had observed, that according to the parable of Achan, I
"mighi remove that accursed thing from among us." Whythen, Sir, said he, in the first place, you have four English-
men, who huve tuki'n savage women to their wives, by
whom they have several children, though none of them are legally married, as the law of God and man requires; they,
I say, Sir, arc no less than adulterers, and as they still live
in adultery, are liable to the curse of God. I know, Sir,
you may object the want of a priest, or clergyman of any
kind; as also, pen, ink, and paper, to write down a contract of marriage, and have it signed between them. But
neither this, nor what the Spanish governor has told you of
their choosing by consent, can be reckoned a marriage, nor
any more than an agreement to keep them from quarrelling
among themselves: for, Sir, the essence or sacrament of
matrimony (so he called it) not only consists in mutual con-
sent, but in the legal obligation, which compels them to
own and acknowledge one another, to abstain trum other
persons, the men to provide for their wives and children,
and the women to the same and like conditions, mutatis mu-
tandis, on their side: whereas, Sir, these men, upon their
own pleasure, on any occasion, may forsake those women,
and marry others, and by disownmg their children, sailer
them utterly to perish." "Now, Sir," added he, "can
God be honoured in such an unlawful liberty as this? how can a blessing succeed to the best endeavours, if men are
allowed to live in so licentious a way {" I was indeed struck
with the thing myself, and thought that they were much to
blame, that no formal contract had been made, though it
had been but breaking a stick between them, to srgagc
them to live as man and wife, never to separate, but love,
cherish, and comfort one another all their lives; "yet,
Sir," said I, " when they took these women, I was not here,
and if it is adultery, it is past my remedy, and I cannot help
it." "True, Sir," answered the young priest, "you can-
not be charged with that part of the crime which was done
in your absence: but I beseech you don't flatter yourself,
that you are under no obligation now to put a period to it:
which if you neglect to do, the guilt will be entirely on you
alone, since it is certainly in nobody's power but yours, to
alter their condition." I must confess, 1 was so dull, that I
thought he meant I should part them, and knowing that
this would put the whole island into confusion, 1 told him I
could not consent to it upon any account whatsoever. "Sir,"
said he, in great surprise, "I do not mean that you should
separate, but marry them, by a written contract, signed by
both man and woman, and by all the witnesses present,
which all the European laws decree to be of sufficient ef-
ficacy." Amazed with such true piety and sincerity, and
considering the validity of a written contract, I acknowledged
all that he said to be very just and kind, and that I would
discourse with the men about it; neither could I see what
reason they could have not to let him marry them, whose authority in that affair is owned to be as authentic as if they
were married byany of our clergymen in England.
The next complaint he had to make to me was this, that
though these English subjects of mine have lived with these
women seven years, and though they were of good under-
standing, and capable of instruction, having learned not
only to speak, but to read English, yet all thjs while they
had never taught them any thingof the Christian religion,
or the knowledge of God, much less in what manner he
ought to be served. And is not this an unaccountable
neglect?" said he warmly. "Depend upon it, God Al-
mighty will call them to account for such contempt. And
though I am not of your religion, yet I should be glad to
see these people released from the devil's power, and be
saved by the principles of the Christian religion, the know-
ledge of God. "f a Redeemer, the resurrection, and of a
future state. But as it is not too late, if you please to give
me leave to instruct them, I doubt not but I shall supply
this great dtfect, by bringing them into the great circle of Christianity, even while you continue in the island,"
I could hold no longer, but embracing him, told him,
with a thousand thanks, I would grant whatever he request-
ed, and desired him to proceed in the third article, which
he did in the following manner:
"Sir," said he, "it should be a maxim among all Christ-
ians, that Christian knowledge ought to be propagated
by all possible means, and on all occasions. Upon this
accountour church sends missionaries into Persia, India, and
China, men who are willing to die for the sake of God and
the Christian faith, in order to bring poor infidels into the
way of salvation. Now, Sir, as here is an opportunity to
convert seven and thirty poor savages, I wonder how you
can pass by such an occasion of doing good, which is really worth the expense of a man's whole life."
I must confess I was so confounded at this discourse, that
I could not tell how to answer him. "Sir," said he, seeing
me in disorder, " I shall be very sorry if I have given you
offence." "No, Sir," said I, " I am rather confounded;
and you know my circumstances, that being bound to the
East-Indies in a merchant ship, I cannot wrong the owners
to much, as to detain the ship here, the men laying at victuals and wages on their account. If I stay above twelve
days, I must pay 3/. sterling per diem demurrage, nor must
the ship stop above eight days more; so that I am unable to engage in this work, unless I would leave the ship, and
be reduced to my former condition." The priest, ihcugii
he owned this was hard upon me, yet laid it to my con-
science, whether the blessing of saving seven and thirty
souls was not worth venturing all that 1 had in the world?"
"Sir," said I, "it is very true: but as you are an ecclesias-
tic, it naturally falls into your profession; why, therefore,
don't you rather offer to undertake it yourself, than press
me to it i" upon this he turned about, making a very low
bow, "I most humbly thank God and you, Sir, (said he)
for so blessed a call; and most willingly undertake so glo-
rious an office, which will sufficiently compensate all the hazards and difficulties I have gone through in a long and
uncomfortable voyage."
While he was thus speaking, I could discover a rapture
in his face, by his colour going and coming; at the same
time his eyes sparkled like lire, and all tlie signs oi" the
most zealous transports. And when I asked whether he
was in earnest ?" Sir," said he, "it was to preach to the 6
Indians I consented to come along with you; these infidels,
even in this little Island, are infinitely of more worth than
my poor life: if so that Ishould prove the happy instrument
of saving these poor creatures' soul?, I care not if 1 never
see my native country again. One thing I only beg of you
more is, that you would leave Friday with me, to be my
interpreter, without whose assistance neither of us will
understand each other."
This request very sensibly troubled me: first upon Fri-
day's being bred a Protestant; and secondly, for the af-
fection I bore to him for his fidelity: But immediately the
remembrance of Friday's father coming into my head, I re-
commended him to him as having learned Spanish, which
the priest also understood; and so was thoroughly satisfied
with him.
When we came to the Englishmen, after I had told them
what necessary things I had done for them, I talked to them
of the scandalous life thev led ; told them what notice the
clergymen had taken of it, and asked them if they were
married men or bachelors? they answered, two of them
were widowers, and the other three single men. But said
I, with what conscience can you call these your wives, by
whom you have so many children, and yet are not lawfully
married? they all said, that they took them before the
Governor as such, having nobody else to marry them, which they thought as legal, as if they had a parson. No
doubt, said I, but in the eye of God it is so: but unless I
am assured of your honest intent, never to desert these poor
creatures, I can do nothing more for you, neither can you
expect God's blessing while you live in such an open course
of adultery. Hereupon Will Atkins, who spoke for the rest,
told me, that they believed their wives the most innocent
and virtuous creatures in the world; that they would never
forsake them while they had breath; and that, if there was
a clergyman in the ship, they would be married to them
with all their hearts. I told you before, said I, that I have
a minister with me, who shall marry you to-morrow morn-
ing, if you are willing; so I would have you consult to-
night with the rest about it. I told him the clergyman was
a Frenchman, and knew not a word of English, but that I
would act as clerk between them. And indeed this busi-
ness met with such speedy success, that they all told me, in a few minutes after, that they were ready to be formally
married, as soon as I pleased; with which informing the
priest, he was exceedingly rejoiced.
Nothing now remained, but that the women should he
made sensible of the meaning of the thing: with which be-
ing well satisfied, they with their husbands attended at my
apartment the next morning; there was my priest, habited
in a black vest, something like a cassock, with a sash round
it, much resembling a minister, and 1 was his interpreter.
But the seriousness of his behaviour, and the scruples he
made of marrying the women, who were not baptized, gave
them an exceeding reverence for his person: nor indeed
would he marry them at all, till he obtained my liberty to
discourse both with the men and women, and then he told
them, that in the sight of all indifferent men, and in the
sense of the laws of society, they had lived in open adultery,
which nothing now, but their consent to marry, or final
separation, could put an end to; and even here was a diffi-
culty with respect to thelaws of Christian matrimony, in
marrying a professed Christian to a heathen idolater, unbaptized; but yet there was time enough to make them
profess the name of Christ, without which nothing could be
done; that, besides, he believed they were very indifferent
Christians: and consequently had not discoursed with their
wives upon that subject; and that unless they promised
him to do so, he could not marry them, as being expressly
forbidden by the laws of God.
All this they heard attentively, and owned readily."But, Lord, Sir," said Will Atkins to me, " how should
we teach them religion, who know nothing ef it ourselves?
how can we talk to our wives of God, Jesus Christ, hea-
ven and hell? why they would only laugh at us, who never
yet have practised religion, but on the contrary all manner
of wickedness." "Will Atkins," said I, "cannot you tell your wife she is in the wrong, and that her gods are id:tls,
which can neither speak nor understand; but that our God,
who has made, can destroy all things; thai he rewards the
good and punishes the wicked; and at last will bring us 'o
judgment- cannot you tell her these things?" "Thai's
true," said Will Atkins, "but then she'll te:l mo it is utterly
false, since I am not punished and sent to the devil, who
hath been such a wicked creature." These words I inter-
preted to the priest. '' Oh!" suidhe, "tell him his repent-
ance will make him a very good minister to his spouse, and
qualify him to preach on the mercy and long-suffering of a
merciful Being, who desires not the death of a sinner, and
even defers damnation to the last judgment; this will lead
him to the doctrine of the resurrection, and will make him
an excellent preacher to his wile." I repeated this to Atkins,
who being more than ordinary affected with it, replied,
"I know all this, Sir, and a great deal more | but how can
1 litvo the impudence to talk thus to my wife, when my
conscience witnesses against me?" " Alas!" said he (with tears in hi* eye*, and giving a great sigh) " as for repenting,
that U for ever past me." "Past you! Atkins," said I
"what do you mean?" "You know well enough," said he,
"what I mean; I mean it is too late."
When I told the priest what he said, the poor affectionate
man could not refrain from weeping; but recovering
himself, " Pray, Sir," said he, "ask him if he is contented
that it is too late; or is he concerned, and wishes it were
not so?" this question I put fairly to Atkins, who replied
in a passion," How can I be easy in a state which I know
must terminate in my ruin? for I really believe, some time
or other, I shall cut my throat, to put a period both to my
life, and to the terrors of my conscience."
At this the clergyman shook his head: "Sir," said he,
"pray tell him it is not too late; Christ will give him re-
pentance, if he has recourse to the merit of his passion.—
Does he think he is beyond the power of Divine Mercy?
there may indeed be a time when provoked mercy will no
longer strive, but never too late for men to repent in this
world." I told Atkins every word the priest had said, who
then parted from us to walk with his wife, while we dis-
coursed with the rest. But these were very stupid in reli-
gious matters: yet all of them promised to do their endea-
vours to make their wives turn Christians; and upon which
promises the priest married the three couple. But as At-
kins was the only sincere convert, and of more sense than
the rest, my clergyman was earnestly inquiring after him:
"Sir," said he, "let us walk out of this labyrinth, and I
dare say we shall find this poor man preaching to his wife
already." And indeed we found it true; for coming to the
edge of the wood, we perceived Atkins and his savage wife
titting under the shade of a bush, in very earnest discourse; R2
he pointed to the sun, to the quarters of the earth, to himself,
to her, the woods, and the trees. Immediately we could
perceive him start upon his feet, fall down upon his knees,
and lift up both his hands; at which the tears ran downmy
clergyman's cheeks; but our great misfortune was, we
could not hear one word that passed between them. Ano-
ther time he would embrace her, wiping the tears from her
eyes, kissing her with the greatest transports, and then both
kneel down for some minutes together. Such raptures of
joy did this occasion in my young priest, that he could
scarcely contain himself: And a little after this we observed
by her motion, as frequently lifting up her hands, and laying
them on her breast, that she was mightily affected with
his discourse, and so they withdrew from our sight.
When we came back we found them both waiting to be
called in; upon which he agreed to examine him alone, and
so 1 began thus to discourse to him. "Prithee, Will Atkins,"
said I, "what education have you? what was your Father?"
IV. A. A better man than ever I shall be; he was, Sir, a
clergyman, who gave me good instruction, or correction,
which 1 despised, like a brute as I was, and murdered my
poor father.
Pr. Ha! a murderer!
[Here the Priest started and icoi.'i/ fale, as thinking be had really
I':lledhis Fatber.]
R. C. What, did you kill him with your hands?
U'.A, No, Sir, 1 cut not his throat, but broke his heart
by the most unnatural turn of disobedience to the tendersst
an"! best of fathers.
R.C. Well, I pray God grant you repentance: I did
not ask you to extort a confession ; but I ask you because I
see you have more knowledge of what is good than your
companions.
W.A. O Sir, whenever I look back upon my past life,
conscience upbraids me with my father: the sins against
our parents make the deepest wounds, and their weight lies
the heaviest upon the mind.
R. C. You talk, Will, too feelingly and sensibly for me;
I am not able to bear it.
W. A. You bear it, Sir! you know nothing of it!
R. C. But yes, Atkins, I do; and every shore, valley,
ai:d tree in the island, witness the anguish of my soul far
my undutifidnesg to my kind father, whom I have murder-
ed likewise: yet my repentance falls infinitely short of
yours. Bur, Will, how comes the sense of this matter to touch you just now?
W.A. Sir, the work you have set me about, has occa-
sioned it; for talking to my wife about God and religion,
she has preached me such a sermon, that I shall retain it in
lasting remembrance.
R, C. No, no, it is your own moving pious arguments to
her, has made conscience fling them back upon you. But
pray, Atkins, inform us what passed between you and your
wife, and in what manner did you begin.
W. A, I talked to her of the laws of marriage, the reason
of such compacts, whereby order and justice is maintained;
without which men would run from their wives and chil-
dren, to the dissolution of families or inheritances.
R. C. Well, and what did she say to all this?
W, d. Sir, we began our discourse in the following man-
ner, which I shall exactly repeat according to my mean ca-
pacity, if you think it worth your while to honour it with
your attention.
THE DIALOGUE BETWEEN WILL ATKINS AND
HIS WIFE, IN THE WOOD.
Wife.—YOU tell me marriage God appoint, have you -
God in your country f
W. A. Yes, child, God is in every nation.
Wife. No; great old Benamuckee God is in my country,
not yours.
IV. A. My dear, God is in heaven, which he made; he
also made the earth, the sea, and all that is therein.
IVife. Why you not tell me much long ago?
W.A. My dear, I have been a wicked wretch, having.
a long time lived without the knowledge of God in the
world.
Wife. What, not know great God in own nation? No
do good ting? no say O to him? that's strange!
W. A. But, my dear, many live as if there was no God
in heaven for all that.
Wife. Why God suifer them; why makee not live well?
W. A. It is our own faults, child.
Wife. But if he is much great, can makee kill, why no
makee kill when no serve him? no be good mans, no cry
O to him? R 3
IV. A. That's true, my dear, he may strike us dead, but
his abundant mercy spareth us.
Wife. Did not you tell God tankee for that?
W. A. No, I have neither thanked him for his mercy,
nor feared him for his power.
Wife. Then me not believe your God be good, nor
makee kill, when you make him angry.
W.A. Alas! must iny wicked life hinder you from be-
lieving in him?
Wife. How can me tink your God live there? (pointing
to Heaven ) Sure he no ken what do you here. W. A. Yes, my dear, he hears us speak, sees what we
do, and knows what we even think.
Wife. Where then makee power strong, when he hears
you curse, swear de great damn?
W. A. My dear this shows indeed he is a God and not
a man, who has such tender mercy.
Wife. Mercy! what you call mercy?
W. A. He pities and spares us: as he is our great Crea-
tor, so he is also our tender Father,
Wife, So God never angry, never kill wicked, then he
no good, no great mighty.
. W..4. O my dear, don't say so, he is both; and many
times he shows terrible examples of his judgment and ven-
geance.
Wife. Then you makee de bargain with him; you do
bad ting, he no hurt you, he hurt other mans.
W. A. No, indeed, my sins are all presumptions upon
his goodness.
Wife. Well, and yet no makee you dead; and you give
him no tankee neither?
W. A. It is true I am an ungrateful, unthankful dog, that
I am.
Wife. Why, you say, he makee you, why makee you no
much better then?
W. A. It is I alone that have deformed myself, and abused
his goodness.
Wife. Pray makee God know me, me no makee him
angry, no do bad ting.
W. A. You mean, my dear, that you desire I would teach
you to know God: alas! poor deat creature, he must teach
thec, and not I. But I'il pray earnestly to htm to direct
thee, and to forgive me a mist.iabie sinner, ^Hcr
went a little distance, and kneeling down, prayed earnestly to God to enlighten her mind, and to pardon his sins; when this was done, they continued their discourse thus.)
Wife. What you put down knee for? for what hold up
hand? Who you speak to?
W. A. My dear, I bowed in token of submission to him
that made me, and prayed that he would open your eyes
and understanding.
Wife. And can he do that too? and will he hear what
you say f
W, A. Yes, my dear, he bids us pray, and has given us
promise that he will hear us.
Wife. When did he bid you pray? what! do you hear
him speak?
W. A. No, my dear, but God has spoken formerly to
good men from heaven: and by divine revelation they have
written all his laws down in a book.
Wife. O where that good book f
W. A. I have it not now by me; but one time or other I
shall get it for you to read. Then he embraced her with
great affection.
Wife. Pray tell a mee, did God teachee them write that
book?
W. A. Yes, and by that rule we know him to be God.
Wife. What way, what rule you know him?
W. A. Because he teaches what is good, just, and holy; and forbids all wicked and abominable actions that incur
his displeasure.
Wife. O me fain understand that, and if he do all things
you say he do, surely he hear me say O to him; he make
me good if I wish to be good; he not kill me if I love him;
me tink, believe him great God; me say O to him, along
with you, my dear.
Here the poor man fell upon his knees, and made her
kneel down by him, praying with the greatest fervency,
that God would instruct her-by his holy Spirit ' and that
God by his providence would send them a Bible for both
their instructions. And such was the early piety of this
new convert, that she made him promise never to forsake
God any more, lest being made dead, as she called it, she
should not only want her instructor, but himself be miser-
able in a long eternity.
Such a surprising account as this was, proved very af-
ccting to as beUi, b.n particularly to the young clergyman, 
who was mightily concerned he could not talk to her himself.
"Sir," said he, "there is something more to be done to
this woman than to marry her: I mean that she ought to
be baptized." To this I presently agreed: "Pray," said
he, "ask her husband, whether he has ever talked to her of
Jesus Christ, the salvation of sinners, the nature of faith, and
redemption in and by him, and of the Holy Spirit, the resur-
rection, last judgment, and a future state;" but the poor
fellow melted into tears at this question, saying that he had
said something to her of these things, but his inability to
talk of them, made him afraid, least her knowledge of them
should rather make her contemn religion, than be benefited
by it; but that if I would discourse with her, it would be
very evident my labour would not be in vain. Accord-
ingly I called her in, and placing myself as interpreter be-
tween the religious priest and the woman, I entreated him to go on; but surely never was such a sermon preached by
any clergyman in these latterdays, with so much zeal, know-
ledge, and sincerity: in short, he brought the woman to
embrace the knowledge of Christ, and of redemption by
him, with so surprising a degree of understanding, that she
made it her own request to be baptized.
He then performed his office in the sacrament of baptism,
first, by saying some words over to himself in Latin, and
then asking me to give her a name, as being her godfather;
and pouring a whole dishful of water upon the woman's
head, he said, " Mary, I baptize thee, in the name of the
Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost;" so that
none could know of what religion he was. After this he
pronounced the benediction in Latin. Thus the woman
being made a Christian, he married her to Will Atkins;
which being finished, he affectionately exhorted him to
lead a holy life for the future; and since the Almighty, for
the convictions of his conscience, had honoured him to be the instrument of his wife's conversion, he should not dis-
honour the grace of God, that while the savage was con-
verted, the instrument should be cast away. Thus ended
a ceremony, to me the most pleasant and agreeable I ever
witnessed in my life.
The affairs of the island being settled, I waspreparing to
go on board, when the young man (whose mother was^tarv-ed) came to me, saying, that as he understood I had a cler-
gyman with me, who had married the Englishmen with 
savages, he had a match to make between two Christians,
which he desired might be finished before I departed.—
Thinking that it was he himself thathad courted his mother's
maid, I persuaded him not to do any thing rashly upon the
account of his solitary circumstances; that the maid was an
unequal match for him, both in respect to substance and
years; and that it was very probable he would live to re-
turn to his own country, where he might have a far better choice. At these words, smiling,he interrupted me, thank-
ing me for my good advice; that as he had nothing to beg
of me but a small settlement, with a servant or two, or some
new necessaries, so he hoped I would not be unmindful of
him when I returned to England, but give Itia letter to his
friends; and that when he was redeemed, the plantation,
and.all its improvements, however valuable, should be re-
turned to me again. But as for the marriage he proposed,
that it was not himself, but that it was between my Jack-ot-
all-trades and the maid Susan.
I wasindeed agreeably surprised at the mentioning this
match, which seemed very suitable, the one being a very
ingenious fellow, and the other an excellent, dexterous, and
sensible housewife, fit to be governess of the whole island:
so we married them the same day; and as 1 was her father
and gave her away, so I gave her a handsome portion, ap-
pointing her and her husband a convenient large spot of
ground for their plantation. The sharing out of the land I
left to Will Atkins, who really divided it very justly, to
every person's satisfaction; they only desired one general
writing under my hand for the whole, which 1 caused to be
drawn up, signed, and sealed to them setting out iheir
bounds, and giving them a right to the whole possession of
their respective plantations, with their improvements, to
them and their heirs, reserving all the rest of the island as
my own property, and a certain rent for every particular
plantation, after eleven years. As to their laws and go-
vernment, I exhorted them to love one another; and as to
the Indians who lived in a nook by themselves, I allotted
three or four of them plantations, and the rest willingly
chose to become servants to the other families, by which
means they were employed in useful labour, and fared
much better than they did before. Besides the savages be-
ing thus mixed with the Christians, the work of their con-
version might be set on foot by the latter, in the clergy-
man's absence, to ourequal satisfaction. The young priest,
however, was a little anxious lest the Christians should not
be willing to do their parts in instructing these poor Indi-
ans j I therefore told him we should call them all-together}
that he should speak to the Spaniards who were Papists,
and I to the English who were Protestants, and make them
promise that they would never make any distinction in re-
ligion, but teach the general true knowledge cf God, and
hi* Son Jtmn Chrbt, in order to convert the poor savages. And this, indeed, they all promised us accordingly.
When I fame lo Will Atkins's Itntme, 1 found his baptised
will•, and the young woman newly married to my Jack•uf.
ell Irurtes, wore become great intimates, ond discoursing of
religion toother, "O, Sir," nays Will Atkins, "when
God luis MItItLTS to reconcile to himself, he never wants an
instructor; I knew I was unworthy of so good a work, and
therefore this young woman has been sent hither as it were
from heaven, who is sufficient to convert a whole nation of
savages." The young woman blushed, and wan going to
rise; but I desired her to sit still, and hoped that God
would bless her tn so good a work j and then pulling out
a Bible (which 1 brought on purpose in my pocket for him,)
"Here Atkins," said I, " here is an assistant that perhaps
you had not before.'' So confounded was the poor man,
that it was some time before he could speak; at last turning
to his wife, "My dear," said he, "did I not tell you that God could hear what we said.' Here's the book I prayed
for, when you and I kneeled under the bush; God then
heard us, and now has sent it." The woman was surprised,
and thought really God had sent that individual book from
heaven; but I turned to the young woman, and desired her
to explain to the young convert, that God may properly be
said to answer our petitions, when, in the course of his pro-
vidence, such particular things came to pass as we petition-
ed for. This the young woman dtd effectually; but surely
Will Atkins's joy cannot be expressed; no man being more
thankful for any thing in the world, than he was tor his
Bible, nor desired it from a better principle.
After several religious discourses, I desired the young
woman to give me an account of the anguish she felt when
she was starving to death with hunger; to which she rea-
dily consented, and began in the following manner:
"Sir," said she, " all our victuals being gone, after I bad
fasted one day, my stomach was very sickly, and, at the ap-
preach of night, I was inclined to yawning and sleepy.—When I slept upon the couch three hours, I awaked a lit-
tle refreshed: three hours after, my stomach being more
and more sickly, I lay down again but could not sleep, be-
ing very faint and ill. Thus I passed the second day with
a strange variety, first hungry, then sick again, with Teachings to vomit: that night I dreamed I was at Barbadoes,
buying plenty of provisions, and dined heartily. But when
I awaked, my spirits were exceedingly sunk, to find myself
in the extremity of famine. There was but one glass of
wine, which being mixed with sugar, I drank up; but for
want of substance to digest upon, the fumes of it got into
my head, and made me senseless for some time. The third
day I was so ravenous and furious, that I could have eaten
a little child if it had come in my way; during which time
I was as mad as any creature in Bedlam. In one of these
fits I feil down, and struck my face against the corner of
a pallet-bed, were my mistress lay; the blood gushed out
of my nose, but by my excessive bleeding, both the violence
of the fever, and the ravenous part of the hunger abated.-—
After this, I grew sick again, strove to vomit but cou'd notj
then bleeding a second time, I swooned away as dead 5
when I came to myself, I had a dreadful gnawing pain in
my stomach, which went off towards night, with a longing
desire for food. I took a draught of water and sugar, but
it came up again; then I drank water without sugar, and
that staid with me. I laid me down on the bed, praying
God would take me away: after I had slumbered, I thought myself a-dying, therefore recommended my soul to God,
and wished somebody would throw me into the sea. All
this while my departing mistress lay by me: the last bit of
bread she had, she gave 18•her dear child, my young master.
The morning after I fell into a violent passion of crying,
and after that into hunger. I espied the blood that came
from my nose in a basin, which I immediately swallowed
up. At night I had the usual variations, as the pain in the stomach, sick, sleepy, and ravenous; and I had no thought
but that I should die before morning. In the morningcama
on terrible gripings in my bowels. At this time I heard my
young master's lamentations, by which I understood his
mother was dead. Soon after this, the sailors cried, 'A
tail t a sail!' hallooing as if they were distracted for joy of
that relief, which afterwards we received i'rom your hands,"
Surely never was a more distinct account of starving to
death than this. But to return to the disposition of tiiings
among my people, I did not take any notice to them of the
sloop that I had framed, neither would 1 leave them the
two pieces of brass cannon, or the two quarter-deck guns
that I had on board, lest, upon any disgust, they should
have separated, or turned pirates, and so make the island a
den of thieves, instead of a plantation of sober, pious peo-.
pie: but leaving them in a flourishing condition, with a
promise to send them further relief from Brazil, as sheep,
hogs, and cows, (being obliged tokill the latter at sea, having
no hay to feed them) I went on board the ship again, the
first of May, 1695, after having been twenty days among
them; and next morning, giving thenra salute of five guns
at parting, we set sail for the Brazils. The third day, to-
wards evening there happening a calm, and the current
being very strong, we were drove to the N. N. E. towards
the land. Some hours after, we perceived the sea covered
as it were with something very black, not easily at first to
be discovered: upon which our chief mate ascending the
shrouds a little way, and taking a view with the perspec-
tive glass, he cries out, " An army! an army !" " you fool,"
said I, " what do you mean?" "Nay, Sir," said he " don't
be angry, I assure you, it is not an army, but a fleet too,
for I believe thereare a thousand canoes paddling along,
and making with great haste towards us.''
- Indeed every one of us were surprised at this relation;
and my nephew, the captain, could not tell what to think
of it, but thought we should all be devoured. Nor was I
free from concern, when I considered how much we were becalmed, and what a strong current set towards the shore;
however, I encouraged him not to be afraid, but bring the
ship to an anchor, as soon as we were certain that we must
engage them. Accordingly we did so, and furled all our
sails; as to the savages we feared nothing, but only that
they might set the ship on fire; to prevent which, I ordered
them to get their boats out, and fasten them, one close by
the head, and another by the stern, well manned, \\ita
skeetaud buckets to extinguish the flames, should it so hap pen.
The savages soon came up with us, but there were not so
many as the mate had said, for instead of a thousand canoes
there wereonly one hundred and twenty; too many indeed
for us, several of their canoes containing about sixteen jot
seventeen men. As they approached us, they seemed to be in the great-
est amazement, not knowing what to make of us. They
rowed round the ship, which occasioned us to call to the
men in the boats not to suffer them to come near them.—
Hereupon they beckoned to the savages to keep back, which
they accordingly did; but at their retreat they let fly about
filty arrows among us, and very much wounded one of our
men in the long-boat. I called to them not to fire upon
any account, but handing them down some deal boards, the
carpenters made them a kind of fence to shield them from
the arrows. In half an hour after they carru; so near astern
of us, that we had a perfect sight of them; then they rowed
a little further out, till they came directly along-side of us,
and then approached so near, that they could hear us speak:
this made me order all my men to keep close, and get their
guns ready. In the mean time I ordered Friday to go out
upon deck, and ask them in his language what they meant.
No sooner did he do so, but six of the savages, who were
in the foremost canoe;, stooping down, showed us their
jmked backsides, as much as to say in English, Kiss our
———: but Friday quickly knew what this meant, by im-
mediateiv crving out they were going to shoot; unfortunately lor him, poor creature, who fell under the cloud of
three hundred arrows, no less than seven piercing through
his body, killing one of the best servants, and faiti.ifallesL of
companions in all my solitudes and afflictions.
So enraged was I at the death of poor Friday, that the
guns, which before were charged only with powder, to
frighten them, I ordered to be loaded with small shot; nor
did the gunners fail in their aim, but at this broadside split
and overset thirteen or fourteen of their canoes, which
killed numbers of them, and set the rest a swimming: the
others, frightened out of their wits, little regarding their
fellows drowning, scoured away as fast as they could. One
poor wretch our people took up, swimming for his life, an
hour after. He was verv sullen at first, so that he would
neither eat nor speak; but I took a way to cure him, by
ordering them to throw him into the sea, which they did,
and then he came swimming back like a cork, calling in his
tongue, as I suppose, to save him. So we took him on
board, but itwasalong time before we could make him speak
or understand English: yet when we had taught him, he told us, they were going with their kings to fight a ^rcat
S
battle; and when we asked him, what made them come up
to us? he said," to makee de great wonder look;" here
it is to be noted, that those natives, and those of Africa,
always add two e's at the end of English words, as makes,
takee, and the like, from which it is a very difficult thing to
make them break off.
Being now under sail, we took our last farewell of poor
honest Friday, and interred him with all possible decency
and solemnity, putting him in a coffin,.and committing
him to the deep, at the same time causing eleven guns to
be fired over him. Thus ended the life of one of the most
grateful, faithful, honest, and affectionate servants, that ever
any man was blessed with in the world.
Having now a fair wind for Brazil, in about twelve days
time we made land in the latitude of five degrees south of
the line. Four days we kept on S. by E. in sight of shore,
when we made Cape St. Augustine, and in three days we
came up to an anchor off the Bay of all Saints. I had great
difficulty here to get leave to hold correspondence on shore;
for neither the figure of my partner, my two merchant trus-
tees, nor the fame of my wonderful preservation in the
Island, could procure me the favour, till such time as the
prior of the monastery of the Augustines (to whom I had
given 50O-moidores) obtained leave from the Governor, lor
me, personally, with the captain and one more, together
with eight sailors, to come on shore; upon this condition,
that we should not land any goods out of the ship, nor
carry any person away without licence: I found means,
however, to get on shore three bales of English goods, such
as fine broad cloths, stuffs, and some linen, which I brought
as a present for my partner, who had sent me on board a
present of fresh provision?, wine, and sweetmeats, worth
about thirty moidores, including some tobacco, and three
or four fine gold medals.
Here I delivered my partner in goods to the value of
JOOl. sterling, and obliged him to fit up the sloop I bought
for the use of my island, in order tosendthem refreshments;
and so active was he in this matter, that he had the vessel
finished in a few days, to the master of which I gave par-
ticular instructions to find the place. I soon loaded him
with a small cargo; and one of our sailors offered to settle
there, upon myletter to the Spanish governor, if I would
allot him tools and a plantation. This I willingly granted, and gave him the savage we had taken prisoner to be his
slave. All things being ready for the voyage, my old
partner told me there was an acquaintance of his, a Brazil
planter, who having fallen under the displeasure of the
church, and in fear of the Inquisition, which obliged him to
be concealed, would be glad of such an opportunity to
make his escape, with his wife and two daughters; and if I
would allot them a plantation in my island, he would give
them a small stock to begin with, forthat the officers had al-
ready seized his effects and estate, and left him nothing but
a little household stuff and two slaves. This request I pre-
sently granted, concealing him and his family on board our
ship, till such time as the sloop (where all the effects were)
was gone out of the bay, and then we put them on board,
who carried some materials, and plants for planting sugar-canes, along with them. By this sloop, among other things,
I sent my subjects three milch cows and five calves, about
22 hogs, three sows big with pig, two mares and a stone-horse. I also engaged three Portugal women to go for sake
of the Spaniards, which, with the persecuted man's two
daughters, were sufficient, since the rest had wives of their
own, though in another country; all which cargo arrived safe
no doubt to their exceeding comfort, who, with this addi-
tion, were about sixty or seventy people, besides children.
At this place, my truly honest and pious clergyman left
me; for a ship, being ready to set sail for Lisbon, he asked
me leave to go thither; but I assure you it was with the
greatest reluctance I parted from a person, whose virtue
and piety merited the greatest esteem.
From the Brazils we made directly over the Atlantic
Ocean to the Cape of Good Hope, having a tolerable good
voyage, steering for the most part S. E. We were on a
trading voyage, and had a supercargo on board, who was
to direct all the ship's motions after she arrived at the Cape,
only being limited to a certain number of days, for stay, by
charter party, at the several ports she was to go to. At the
Cape we only took in fresh water, and then sailed for the
coast of Coromandel; we were there informed, that a French
man of war of 50 guns, and two large merchant ships, were
sailed for the Indies, but we heard no more of them.
In our passage, we touched at the Island of Madagascar,
where, though the inhabitants are naturally fierce and treaS2
cherous, and go constantly armed with bows and lances,
yet for some time they treated us civilly enough; and, in
exchange for knives, scissars, and other trifles, they brought
us eleven good fat bullocks, which we took partly for pre-
sent victuals, and the remainder to salt for the ship's use.
So curious was I to view every corner «f the world where
I came to, that I went on shore as often as I could. One
evening when on shore, we observed numbers of the people
stand gazing at us at a distance. We thought ourselves in
no danger, as they had hitherto used us kind'y. However,
we cut three boughs out of a tree, sticking them at a distance
from us, which it seems in that country, is not only a token
of truce and amity, but when poles or boughs are set upon
the other side, it is a sign the truce is accepted. In
these treaties, however, there is one principal thing to be
regarded, that neither party come beyond one another's
three poles or boughs; so that the middle space is not only
secure, but is aiso allowed as a market for traffic and com-
merce. When the truce is thus accepted, they stick up
theirjavelins and lances at the first poles, and come on un-
armed; but if any violence is offered, away they run to
their poles, take up their weapons, and then the truce is
at an end. This evening it happened that a greater num-
ber of people than usual, both men and women, traded
among usfor such toys as we had, with such great civility,
that we made us a little tent, of large boughs of trees, some
ol the men resolving to lie on shore all night; but for my
part, 1 and some others took our lodgings in the boat, with
boughs of trees spread over it, having a sail spread at the
bottom to lie upon. About two o'clock in the morning we
were awakened by the firing of muskets, and our men cry-
ing out for help, or else they would all be murdered. Scarce
had we time to get the boat a.shore, when our men came
plunging themselves into the water, with about fbur hun-
dred of the islanders at their heels. We took up seven of
the men, three of them very much wounded, and one left
behind killed, while the enemy poured their arrows so
thick among us, that we were forced to make a barricado,
with boards lying at the side of the boat, to shield us from
danger; and, having got ready our fire.arms, we returned
them a volley, which wounded several of them, as we could
hear by their cries. In this condition we lay till break of
day, and then making signals of distress to the ship, which
mv nephew the captain heard and understood, he weighed
anchor, and stood as near the shore as possible, and then
sent another boat with ten hands in her to assist us; but we
called to them not to come near, informing them of our un-
happy condition. However they ventured; when one of
the men taking the end ofa tow-line in one hand, and keep-
ing our boat between him and our adversaries, swam to us,
and slipping our cables, they towed us out of reach of their
arrows, and quickly after a broad-side was given them from
the ship, which made a most dreadful havock among them.
When we got on board, we examined into the occasion of
this fray. The men who fled informed us, that an old wo-
man, who sold milk within the poles, had brought a young
woman with her, who carried roots and herbs, the sight of
whom so much tempted our men, that they offered rude-
ness to the maid, at which the old woman set up a great cry; nor would the sailors part with their prize, but carried
her among the trees, while the old woman went, and
brought a whole army down upon them. At the beginning
of the attack, one of our men was killed with a lance, and
the fellow who began the mischief, paid dear enough for
his mistress, though as yet we did not know what had b:.-
comeofhim; the rest tuckily escaped. The third night
after the action, being curious to understand how ariairs
stood, I took the supercargo and twenty stout fellows with
me, and landed about two hours before midnight at the same
place where those Indians stood the night before, and .there
we divided our men.into two bodies, the boatswain com-
manding one, and I another. It was so dark, that we
could see nobody, neither did we hear any voice near us:
but by and by the boatswain falling over a dead body, we
agreed to halt till the moon should rise, which we knew
would be an hour after. We perceived here no fewer than
two and thirty bodies upon the ground, whereof two were
not quite dead. Satisfied with this discovery I was forgo-
ing on board again; but the boatswain and the rest told me,
they would make a visit to the Indian town, where these
dogs, so they called them, resided, asking me at the same
time to go along with them: for they did not doubt, besides
getting a good booty, but they should find Tom Jeftery
there, for that was the unhappy man we missed. But I
utterly refused to go, and commanded them back, being S..3,
unwilling to hazard their lives, as the safety of the ship
wholly depended upon them. Notwithstanding all I could
say to them, they all left me but one, and the supercargo;
so we three returned to the boat, where a boy was left, re-
solving to stay till they returned. At parting I told them
I supposed most of them would run the same fate with Tom
Jeffery. To this they replied, "Come boys, come along,
we'll warrant we'll come off safe enough;" and so away
they went notwithstanding all my admonitions, either con-
cerning their own safety or the preservation of the ship.—Indeed they were gallantly armed, every man having a
musket, bayonet, and a pistol, besides cutlasses, hangers,
pole-axes, and hand grenades. They came to a few In-
dian houses at first, which not being the town they expected,
they went farther, and finding a cow tied to a tree, they
concluded that she would be a sufficient guide, and so it
proved; for, after they untied her, she led them directly
to the town, which consisted of above two hundred houses,
several families living in some of the huts together. At
their arrival, all being in profound sleep, the sailors agreed
to divide themselves into three bodies, and set three parts
of the town on fire at once, to kill those that were escaping,
and plunder the rest of the houses. Thus desperately re-
solved, they went to work; but the first party had not
gone far btfore they called to the rest that they had found
Tom Jeffery; whereupon they all ran up to the place, and
found the poor fellow indeed hanging up naked by one
arm, and his throat almost cut from ear to ear. In a house
that was hard by the tree, they found sixteen or seventeen
Indians, who had been concerned in the fray; two or three
of them being wounded, were not gone to sleep: this house
they set on fire first, and in a few minutes after, five or six
places more in the town appeared in flames. The confla-
gration spread like wild-fire, their houses being all of wood,
and covered with flag' or rushes. The poor affrighted in-
liabihints endeavoured to run out to save their lives, but
they were driven back into the flames by the sailors, and
ki!!ed without mercy. At the first house above-mentioned,
after the boatswain had slain two with his po'e-ax, ho threw
a hand grenade into the house, which bursting, made a ter-
tibie havock, killing and wounding most of them: and their
king and most of his train, who were in that house, fell
victims to their lury, every creature of them being either smothered or burnt. All this while they never fired a gun,
least the people should awaken faster than they could over-
power them. But the fire awakened them fast enough,
which obliged our fellows to keep together in bodies. By
this time the whole town was in a flame, yet the fury ra-
ther increased, calling out to one another to remember Tom
Jeffery. The terrible light of this conflagration made me
very uneasy, and roused my nephew the captain, and the
rest of his men, who knew nothing of the matter. When
he perceived the dreadful smoke, and heard the guns go
off, he readily concluded his men were in danger; he there-
fore takes another boat, and comes ashore himself, with
thirteen men well armed. He was greatly surprised to see
me and only two men in the boat, but more so when I told
him the story: but though I urged with him, as I did
with the men, about the dangers ofthe voyage, the interests
of the merchants and owners, and the safety of the ship, yet
my nephew, like the rest, declared, that he would rather
lose the ship, his voyage, his life and all, than his men should
be lost for want of help; and so away he went. For my
part, seeing him resolved to go, I had not power to stay
behind. He ordered the pinnace back again for twelve
men more, and then we marched directly as the flame
guided us. But surely never was such a scene of horror
beheld, or more dismal cries heard, except when Oliver
Cromwell took Drogheda in Ireland, where he neither
spared man, woman, nor child.
The first object, I think, we met with, was the ruins of
one of their habitations, before which lay four men and three
women killed, and two more burnt to death among I he fire,
which was now decaying. Nothing could appear more
barbarous than this revenge; none more cruel than the
authors of it. As we went on, the fire increased, and the
cry proceeded in proportion. We had not gone much far-
ther, when we beheld three naked women, followed by six-
teen or seventeen men, flying with the greatest swiftness
from our men, who shot one of them in our sight. When
they perceived us, whom they supposed also thuir murderers,
they set up a most.dreadful shriek, and both of them swoon-
ed away in fright. This was a sight which might have
softened the hardest heart; and in pity we took some ways
to let them know we would not hurt them, while tae poor
creatures, with bended knees and lifted-up hands, made piteous lamentations to us to save their lives. I ordered
our men not to hurt any of the poor creatures whatsoever;
but being willing to understand the occasion of all this, I
went among these unhappy wretches, who neither under-
stood me nor the good I meant them. However, being
resolved to put an end to this barbarity, I ordered the men
to follow me. We had not gone fifty yards before we came
up with the boatswain, with four of our men at his heels, all
of them covered with blood and dust, and in search of more
people to satiate their vengeance. As soon as we saw them
we called out and made them understand who we were;
upon which they came up to us, setting up a halloo of tri-
umph, in token that more help was come. "Noble captain," said he to my nephew, "I'm glad you're come; we have
not half done with these villainous hellhound dogs; we'll
root out the very nation of them from the earth, and kill
more than poor Tom has hairs upon his head:" and thus he
went on till I interrupted him.—" Blood-thirsty dog," said
I, "will your cruelty never end? I charge you touch not one
creature more; stop your hands, and stand still, or you're a dead man this moment." "Why, Sir," said he, "you
neither know whom you are protecting, nor what they have
done: but pray come hither and behold an instance of
compassion, if such can merit your clemency;" and with that he showed me the poor fellow with his throat cut,
hanging upon the tree.
Indeed, here was enough to fill their breasts with rage,
which, however, I thought had gone too far, agreeable to
these words of Jacob to his sons Simeon and Levi: "Cursed
be their anger, for it was fierce; and their wrath, for it
was cruel." But this sight made my nephew and the
rest as bad as they: nay, my nephew declared, his con-
cern was only for his men; as for the people, not a soul
of them ought to live. Upon this, the boatswain and eight
more directly turned about, and went to finish the intended
tragedy; which being out of my power to prevent, I re-
turned back from the dismal sight, and the piteous cries of
those unfortunate creatures, who were made victims to their
fury. Indeed it was an egregious piece of folly in me to
return to the boat with but one attendant; and I had very
nearpaid for it, having narrowly escaped forty armed In-.
dians, who had been alarmed by the conflagration; but
having passed the place where they stood, I got to the boat accompanied with the supercargo, and so went on board,
sending the pinnace back again, to assist the men in what
might happen. When I had got to the boat, the fire was
almost extinguished, and the noise abated; but I had scarce
been half an hour on board the ship, when I heard another
volley given by our sailors, and a great smoke, which, as I
afterwards found, was our men falling upon those houses
and persons that stood between them and the sea; but here
they spared the wives and children, and killed only the men,
to the number of about sixteen or seventeen. By the time
they got to the shore, the pinnace and the ship's boat were
ready to receive them, and they all got safe on board, not
a man of them having received the least hurt, except two,
one of them having strained his foot, and the other burnt his
hand a little; for they met with no resistance, the poor
Indians being unprepared, amazed, and confounded.
I was extremely angry with every one of them, but par-
ticularly with the captain, who instead of cooling the rage
of the men had prompted them on to further mischief: nor
could he make me any other excuse, but that as he was a
man, he could not master his passions at the sight of one of
his men so cruelly" murdered. As for the rest, knowing
they were not under my command, they took no notice of
my anger, but rather boasted of their revenge. According
to all their accounts, they killed or destroyed about 150
men, women, and children, besides burning the town to
ashes. They took their companion Tom Jeffery from the
tree, covered him with some of the ruins, and so left him.
But however this action of our men might seem to them
justifiable, yet I always openly condemned it with the ap-
pellation of the Massacre of Madagascar. For though the
natives had slain this Jeffery, yet certainly he was the first
aggressor, by attempting to violate the chastity of a young
innocent woman, who ventured down to them, on the faithof
the public capitulation, which was so treacherously broken.
While we were under sail, the boatswain would often
defend his bloody action, by saying, that the Indians had
bioke the truce the night before, by shooting one of our men without just provocation: and what if the poor fellow
had taken a little liberty with the wench, he ought not to
have been murdered in so villainous a manner; and that
they had acted nothing but what the divine laws commis-
sioned to be done to such homicides. However I was in the same mind as before, telling them that they were mur-
derers, and bid them depend upon it that God would blast
their voyage, for such an unparalleled piece of barbarity.
When we came to the Gulf of Persia, five of our men,
who ventured on shore, were either killed or made slaves
by the Arabians, the rest of them having scarce time to
escape to their boat. This made me upbraid them afresb
with the retribution of Heaven for such actions; upon
which the boatswain very warmly asked me, "Whether
those men on whom the tower of Siloam fell, were greater
sinners than the rest of the Gallileans? and besides, Sir,"
said he, "none of these five poor men that are lost, were
with us at the Massacre of Madagascar, as you call it, and
therefore your representations are very unjust, andyourap-
plication improper. Besides," added he, "you are con-
tinually using the men very ill upon this account, and, be-
ing but a passenger yourself, we are not obliged to bear it;
nor can we tell what evil designs you may have to bring uj
to judgment for it in England; and, therefore, if you do
not leave this discourse, as also not concern yourself with
any of our affairs, I will leave the ship, and not sail among
such dangerous company."
All this I heard very patiently; but, it being often re-
peated, I at length told him, the concern I had on board
was none of his business; that I was a considerable owner
in the ship, and therefore had a right to speak in common,
and that I was no way accountable to him, nor any body
else. As no more passed for some time after, I thought
all had been over. At this time we were in the road of
Bengal, where, going on shore with the supercargo one day,
in the evening, as I was preparing to go on board, one of
the men came to me, and told me, I need not trouble my-
self to come to the boat, for that the cockswain and others
had ordered him not to carry me on board anymore. This
insolent message much surprised me; yet I gave him no
answer to it, but went directly and acquainted the super-
cargo, entreating him to go on board, and, by acquainting
the captain with it, prevent the mutiny which I perceived
would happen. But before I had spoke this, the matter
was effected on board; for no sooner was he gone off in
the boat, but the boatswain, gunner, carpenter, and all the
inferior officers, came to the quarterdeck, desiring to speak
with the captain; and there the boatswain made a long
harangue, exclaiming against me, as before mentioned, that
if I had not gone on shore peaceably for my own diversion,
they, by violence, would have compelled me, for their sa-
tisfaction: that as they had shipped with the Captain, so
they would faithfully serve him; but if I did not quit the
ship, or the captain oblige me to it, they would leave the
ship immediately: hereupon, turning his face about, by
way of signal, they all cried out, "ONE and ALL! ONE
and ALL!"
You may be sure, that though my nephew was a man of
great courage, yet he could not but be surprised at their
sudden and unexpected behaviour; and though he talked
stoutly to them, and afterwards expostulated with them,
that in common justice to me, who was a considerable ow-
ner in the ship, they could not turn me as it were out of my
own house, which might bring their lives in danger should
they ever be taken in England; nay, though he invited the
boatswain on shore to accommodate matters with me, yet
all this I say signified nothing; they would have nothing to
do with me; and they were resolved to go on shore if I
came on board. "Well," said my nephew, "if you are
so resolved, permit me to talk with him, and then I have
done;" and so he came to me, giving me an account of their
resolution, how one and all designed to forsake the ship
when I came on board, for which he was mightily concern-
ed. "I am glad to see you nephew," said I, "and rejoice
it is no worse, since they have not rebelled against you;
I only desire you to send my necessary things on shore,
with a sufficient sum of money, and I will find my way to
England as well as I can." Though this grieved my ne-
phew to the heart, yet there was no remedy but compliance:
in short all my necessaries were sent me, anJ'SO this matter
was over in a few hours.
I think I was now near a thousand leagues farther off
England by sea, than at my little kingdom, except this dif-
ference, that I might travel by land over the Great Mogul's
country to Surat, from thence to Bassora, bv sea up the
Persian Gulf, then take the way of the caravans over the
Arabian desert to Aleppo and Scanderoon, there take ship-
ping to Italy, and so travel by land into France, and from
thence across the sea to England.
My nephew left me two persons to attend me; one of
them was his servant, and the other clerk to the purser, 6
who engaged to be mine. I took lodgings-in an English
woman's house, where several French, one English, and two
Italian merchants resided. The Handsome entertainment
I met with here, occasioned me to stay nine months, con-
sidering what course I should take. Some English goods
I had with me of great value, besides a thousand pieces of
eight, and a letter for more, if there was such necessity.—
The goods I soon disposed of to advantage, and bought here
several good diamonds, which I could easily carry about
with me. One morning the English merchant came to me,
as being very intimate together, "Countryman," said he,
"I have a project to communicate to you, which I hope
will suit to both our advantage. To be short, Sir, we are
both in a remote part of the world from our country; but
yet in a place where men of business may get a great deal
of money. Now, if you will put a thousand pounds to my thousand pounds, we will hire a ship to our satisfaction;
you shall be captain, I will be merchant; and we'll go a
trading voyage to China, for why should we lie still like
drones, while the whole world is in a continual motion."
This proposal soon got my consent, being very agreeable
to my rambling genius; and the more so, because I looked
upon my countryman to be a very sincere person; it re-
quired some time before we could get a vessel to our mind,
and sailors to man it accordingly; at length we bought a
ship, and got an English mate, boatswain, and gunner, a
Dutch carpenter, and three Portuguese foremast-men; and,
for want of others, made shift with Indian seamen. We first
sailed to Achin, in the Island of Sumatra, and then to Siam, where we bartered our wares tor some arrack and opium,
the last of which bore a great price among the Chinese; in
a word, we went up to Suskan, making a very great voyage;
and, after eight months time I returned to Bengal, very well
satisfied with this advantage, having not only got a sufficient
quantityof money, bntaninsightofgettingagreatdeal more.
The next voyage my friend proposed to me, was to go
among the Spice Islands, and bring home a load of cloves
from the Manillas, or thereabouts; islands belonging part-
ly to Spain, but where the Dutch trade very considerably.
We were not long in preparing for this voyage, which we
made no less successful than the last, touching at Borneo,
and several other places which I do not perfectly remem-
ber, and returned home in about five months time. We soon sold our spices, which were chiefly cloves and some
.nutmegs, to the Persian merchants, who carried them away
for the Gulf; and, in short, making five to one advantage,
we were loaded with money.
Not long after my friend and I had made up our accounts,
to our entire satisfaction, there came in a Dutch coaster
from Batavia, of about two hundred tons. The crew of
this vessel pretended themselves so sickly, that there were
not hands sufficient to undertake a voyage; and the captain having given out that he intended to go to Europe, public
notice was given that the ship was to be sold. No sooner
did this come to our ears, but we bought the ship, paid the
master, and took possession. We would also have very
willingly entertained some of the men; but they having
received their share of booty, were not to be found, being
altogether fled to Agra, the great city o( the Mogul's resi-
dence: and from thence went to travel to Surat, and so by
the sea to the Persian Gulf. And indeed they had reason
to fly in this manner; for the truth of it was, the pretended
captain was the gunner only, and not the commander;
that having been on a trading voyage, they were attacked
on the shore by the Malayans, who killed three men and
the captain; after whose death the other eleven men run
away with the ship to the Bay of Bengal, and left the mate
and five men more on shore; but of this affair we shall
have occasion to speak more at length hereafter.
However they came by the ship, we thought we bought
it honestly: neither did we suspect any thing of the matter;
when the man showed us a bill of sale for the ship (undoubt-
edly forged) to one EmanuelClostershoven, which name he
went by. And so without any more to do, we picked up
some Dutch and English seamen, resolving for another voy-
age for cloves among the Philippine and. Molucca islands:
in short, we continued thus five or six years, trading from
port to port with extraordinary success. In the seventh
year, we undertook a voyage to China, designing to touch
at Siam, and buy some rice by the way. In this voyage
contrary winds beat us up and down for a considerable time
among the Islands in the Straits of Molucca. No sooner
were we clear of those rugged seas, but we perceived
our ship had sprung a leak, which obliged us to put into the
river Cambodia, which lies northward of the Gulf, and
goes up to Siam.
T
One day, as I was on shore refreshing myself, there
came to me an Englishman, who was gunner's mate on
board an English East-India ship, riding up the river near
the city of Cambodia: "Sir," said he, "you may wonder
at my business, having never seen me in your life; but tho'
] am a stranger, I have something to tell you that very near-
ly concerns you; and indeed it is the imminent danger you
are in has moved me to give you this timeiv notice."—
"Danger!" said I, "what danger? I know of none, ex-
cept my .•.hip being leaky, for which I design to have her
run agicunri to.morrow morning." "I hope you will be
better employed when you shall hear what I have to say to
you. You know the town of Cambodia is about fifteen
leagues up this ri\er; about three leagues on this side of it,
there lie two Dutch and three English ships. And would
vent venture here without considering what strength you
have to engage them?" I knew not what he meant by this
discourse, and turning short upon him, "Sir," said 1, "I
know no reason I have to be afraid either of any Dutch or
English ships. I am no interloper, and what business have
they with me:" "Well, Sir," said the man, "if you do
think yourself secure, all as I-can say, you must take your
chance; however I am very sorry you are so deaf to good
advice; but I assure you, if you do not put to sea immedi-
ately, you will be attacked by five long-boats full of men,
hanged for a pirate, if you are taken, and the par-
ticulars examined afterwards. I thought, Sir," added
he, " I might have met a better reception for such a singu-
lar piece of service." "Sir," said I, "I never was un-
grateful to any man; but pray explain yourself, and I'll go
on board this minute, whether the leak be stopped or no."
"Why, Sir," said he, "to be short, because time is precious,
the matter is this: you know well enough that you was
with the ship at Sumatra, when your captain was murdered
by the Malayans, with three of his sailors; and that either
you, or some who were on board you, ran away with the
ship, and are since turned pirates at sea. Now, Sir, this
is the sum of what I had to say; and I can positively assure
you, that if you are taken, you will be executed without
much ceremony, for undoubtedly you cannot but be sen-
sible what little law merchant ships show to pirates, when-
ever they fall into their hands."
"Sir," said F, "1 thank you for your kind information;
and though I am sure no man coukl couie more honest!/
by the ship than I have done, yet knowing their enterprize,
and being satisfied of your honest intention, I'll be upon my
defence." "Pr'ythee, Sir," said the man, "don't talk of
being upon your defence, the best that you can make is to
be out of danger; and therefore if you have any regard for
your life, and the lives of your men, take the advantage,
without fail of putting out to sea at high-water: by which
means, as you have a whole tide before you, you will be gone
too far out of their reach before they can come down."
"I am mightily well satisfied,'' said I, " in this p.articu!ar;
and for your kindness, which merits my great esteem, pray,
Sir, what amends shall I makevou ?" he replied, " I know
not what amends you are willing to make, because you
may have seme doubts of its certainty: but, to convince
you of the truth of what I say, I have one offer to make to
you. On board one of the English ships, I have nineteen
months pay due to me, and this Dutchman that is with me,
has seven months pay due to him, which if you will make
good to us, we will go along with you. If you shall tind
that there is nothing in what we have said, then we shall
desire nothing; but when you are convinced that we have
saved the ship, your life, and the lives of the men, we will
leave the'whole to your generosity."
So reasonable did this every way appear, that I immedi-
ately consented, and we went directly on board. As soon
as we came on board, my partner calls joyfully out, "That
they had stopped the leak!" " Well, thank God," said I
"but pray let us weigh anchor forthwith."—"Weigh!"
said he, "what is the meaning of this hurry r" "Fray ask
no questions," said I, "but all hands to work, without
losing a moment's time." Upon which, in great surprise,
the Ci'ptain wascal'ed, who immediately ordered the anchor
to be got up; and though the tide was not quite down,
yet being assisted with a little land breeze, we stood to sea.
I then called to mv partner into the cabin, and related the
story at large, which was confirmed and more amplified by
the two men I had brought on board. Scarce had wu
finished our discourse upon this head, but a sailor came to
the cabin door, with a message from the captain, that we were chased by five sloops full of armed men. "Very
well," said I, "it is plain now there is something in it."—And so, going upon deck, I told all the men there was a T •2
design for seizing the ship, and of executing us for pirates;
and asked them whether they would faithfully stand by us,
and by one another?" to which they unanimously replied)
"That they would fight to their last drop of blood." I
then asked the captain, which way he thought best for us
to manage the battle? "Sir," said he, "the only method
is to keep them off with our great shot as long as we are
able, and then have recourse to our small arms; and when
both these fail us, then retire to close quarters, when perhaps the enemy, wanting materials, can neither break open
our bulk heads, nor get in upon us." Mean time the gun-
ner was ordered to bring two guns to bear fore and aft out
of the steerage, and so load them with musket-bullets and
small pieces of old iron; and the deck being cleared, we
prepared for the engagement, still, however, keeping out
at sea. The boats followed us with all the sail they could
make, and we could perceive the two foremost were Eng-
Iish, which outsailed the rest by two leagues, and which we
found would come up with us: hereupon, we fired a gun
without a ball, intimating that they should bring to, and we
put out a flag of truce, as a signal for parley; but rinding
them crowding after uc, til! they came within shot, we took
in our white, and hanging out the red flag, immediately
fired at them with ball: we then called to them with a
speaking trumpet, bidding them at their peril keep off.'
But all this signified nothing; for depending upon the
strength that followed them, they were resolutely bent for
mischief: hereupon I ordered them to bring the ship to, by
which means, they lying upon our broadside, we let fly at
them at once, one of whom carried away the stern of the
hindermost boat, and obliged them not only to take down
their sail, but made them all run to the head of the boat, to
keep her from sinking, and so she lay by, having enough
of it. In the mean time, we prepared to welcome the fore-
most boat in the same manner. While we were doing this,
one of the three hindermost boats came up to the relief of
that which was disabled and took the men out of her. We
again called to parley with them•; but, instead of an answer,
one of the boats came close under our stern; whereupon
our gunner let ily his two chase guns, but missing, the men
in the boat shouted, and waving their caps, came on with
greater fury. To repair this seeming disgrace, the gunner
soon got ready, and firing a second time, did a great deal of mischief among the enemy. We waved again, and, bring-
ing our quarter to bear upon them, fired three guns more,
when we found the boat a sinking, and several men already
in the sea; hereupon, manning our pinnace, I gave orders
to save as many as they could, and instantly to come on
board, because the rest of their boats were approaching:
accordingly they did so, and took up three of them, one of
whom was almost past recovery; and then crowding all the sail we could, after our men came on boa'rd, we stood out
farther to sea, so that the other three boats gave over the chase, when they came up to the first two. Thus delivered
from imminent danger, we changed our course to the east-
-ward, quite out of the course of all European ships.
Being now at sea, and inquiring more particularly of the
two seamen the meaning of all this, the Dutchman at once
let us into the secret. He told us, that the fellow who sold
'us the ship was an arrant thief, who had run away with her;
that the captain was treacherously murdered on the coast
of Molucca by the natives there, with three of his men;
that he, the Dutchman, and four more, being obliged to
have recourse to the woods for their safety, at length escaped
by means of a Dutch ship, in its way to China, which had
sent their boat on shore for fresh water: that, after this,
he went to Batavia, where two of the seamen belonging to
the ship (who had deserted the rest in their travels) arrived, and there gave an account that the• fellow who ran away
with the ship had sold her at Bengal to a set of pirates, who went a cruising, and had already taken one English and
two Dutch ships richly laden.
Now though this was absolutely false, my partner truly
said, that our deliverance was to be esteemed so much the
more, by reason, had we fallen into their hands, we could
have expected nothing from them but immediate death,
considering our accusers would have been our judges; and,
therefore, his opinion was to return directly to Bengal,
where, being known, we could prove how honestly we came
by the^ship, of whom we bought her, and the like, and
where we were sure of some justice; at least would not be
hanged first and judged afterwards. I was at first of my
partner's opinion, but when I had more seriously consider- -
ed of the matter, I told him, we ran a great hazard in at-
tempting to return, being on the wrong side of the Straits .
T3 .
of Molucca, and that, if, upon alarm given, we should be
taken by the Dutch at Batavia, or English elsewhere, our
running away would be a sufficient evidence to condemn us.
This danger indeed startled not only my partner, but like-
wise all the ship's company; so we changed our former re-
solution, and resolved to go to the coast of Tonquin, and
so to that of China, where, pursuing our first design as to
trade, we might likewise have an opportunity to dispose of
the ship some way or other, and to return to Bengal in any
country vessel we could procure. This being agreed to,
we steered away N.N. E. about 50 leagues off the usual
course to the east, which put us to some inconveniences.
As the wind blew steadily against us, our voyage became
more tedious, and we began to be afraid of want of provi-
sion? and what was still worse, we apprehended, that as
those ships, from whose boats we had escaped, were bound
to China, they might get before us, and have given fresh
information, which might create another vigorous pursuit.
Indeed, I could not help being grieved, when I considered
that I who had never wronged or defrauded any person in
my life, was now pursued like a common thief, and, if taken,
to run the greatest danger of being executed as such; and,
though innocent, I found myself under the necessity of fly-
ing tor my safety; and thereby escape being brought to
shame, of which I was even more afraid than of death itself.
It was easy to read my dejection in my countenance. My
mind was oppressed, like those unhappy, innocent persons,
who being overpowered by blasphemous and perjured evi-
dences, wickedly resolved to take away their lives, or ruin
their reputation, have no other recourse in this world to
ease their sorrow, but sighs, prayers, and tears. My partner
seeing me so concerned, encouraged me as well as he could;
and after describing to me the several ports of that coast,
he told me, he would either put me in on the coast of Co-
ching China, or else in the Bay ofTonquin, from whence we
might go to Macao, a town once possessed by the Portu-
guese, and where still many European families resided.
To this place we steered, and early next morning came
in sight of the coast; but thought it advisable to put into
a small river where we could, either overland, or by the
ship's pinr.ace, know what vessels were in any ports there-
vb'iuts. This happy step proved our deliverance; for, nest
g, there came to the ijay of Tonquin two Dutcli
ships, and a third, without any colours; and in the evening
two English ships steered the same course. The river
where we were was but small, and run but a few leagues up
the country northward; the country was wild and barbarous
and the people thieves, having no correspondence with any
other nation; dealing only in fish, oil, and such gross com-
modities; and one barbarous custom they still retained, that
when any vessel was unhappily shipwrecked upon their
coast, they make the men prisoners or slaves; so that now
we might fairly say we were surrounded by enemies both
by sea and land.
As the ship had been leaky, we took the opportunity, in
this place, to search her, and to stop up the places which
let in the water. We accordingly lightened her, and bring-
ing our guns and other moveable things to one side, we assayed to bring her down, that we might come to her bot-
tom; but upon second consideration, we did not think it
safe to let her lie on dry ground, neither indeed was the
place convenient for it. The inhabitants, not used to such
a sight as to sec a^ship lie down on one side, and heel in to-
wards the shore, and not perceiving the men, who were at
work on her bottom, with stages and boats on the off-side,
presently imagined the ship had been cast away, and lay
fast on the ground. Agreeable to this supposition, they
surrounded us with ten or twelve large boats, with a reso-
lution, undoubtedly, to plunder the ship, and carry away
those they found alive for slaves to their king. But when
they perceived our men hard at work on the ship's bottom
and side, washing, graving, and stopping her, it rill«d them
all with such surprise, that they stood gazing as though they
were confounded. Nor could we imagine what their de-
sign was; however, for fear of danger, we handed down
arms and ammunition to those at work, in order to defend
themselves; and, indeed, this precaution was absolutely
necessary; for, in a quarter of an hour after, the natives,
concluding it was really a shipwreck, and that we were sa-
ving our lives and goods, which they thought belonged to
them, came down upon our men, as though it had been in
line of battle. We lay at present but in a very unfit posture
to fight; and before the stages could be got down, or the
men in the boat come on board as they were ordered, the
Cochin Chinese were upon them, and two of their boats
boarding our long-boat, they began to lay hold of our mc;n
as prisoners. The first they seized was a stout English
sailor, who never fired his musket, like a fool as I imagined,
but laid it down in the boat: but he knew what he was
doing; for by main force, he dragged the Pagan out of the
boat into ours by the two ears, and knocked his brains out
against the boat's gunnel; a Dutchman that was next him
snatched up the musket, and knocked down five more with
the butt-end of it; however this was doing very little to their number; but a strange unexpected accident, which
rather merits laughter than any thing else, gave our men a
complete victory over them.
It seems the carpenter, who was preparing to grave the
outside of the ship, as well as to pay the seams, where he
caulked to stop the leaks, had gotten two kettles just let
down in the boat, one filled with boiling pitch, and the
other with rosin, tallow, oil, and such stuff as the ship-
wrights use; the carpenter's man had a great iron ladle
with which he used to supply the workmen with hot stuff,
and as two of the enemies entered the boat where the fel-
low stood, he saluted them with a full'ladle of the hot boil-
ing liquor, which, the poor creatures being half naked, made
them roar out, and jump into the sea. "Well done, Jack,"
says the carpenter, "give them the other dose;" and so
stepping forward himself, takes a mop, and dipping it into
the pitch pot, he and his man so plentifully flung it among
them, as that none escaped being scalded; upon which they
all made the best of their way, crying and howling in such
a frightful manner, that, in all my adventures, I never heard
the like. And, indeed, never was I better pleased with
any conquest than I was with this, there being so little
bloodshed, and having an aversion to killing such savage wretches, (more than was necessary) as knowing they came
on errands, which their law and customs made them think
were just and equitable. By this time, all things being in
order, and the ship swimming, they found their mistake, so
they did not venture a second attack. Thus ended our
merry fight; and having got rice, bread, roots, and sixteen
good hogs on board the day before, we set sail, not daring
to go into the bay of Tonquin, but steered N. E. toward
the island of Formosa, or as tho' we would go to the Ma-
nillas, or Philippine islands, for fear of meeting with any
European ships; when we anchored at the isle of Formosa,
the inhabitants not only courteously supplied us with provisions G .
Visions and fresh water, but dealt very fairly and honestly
with us in their bargains and agreements. From this place
we steered north, keeping still off the coast of China, till
we were beyond all its ports where European ships usually
come; and, at length, being come to the latitude of thirty
degrees, we resolved to.put into the first trading port we
should come at j and standing for the shore, a boat came off
two leagues to us, with an old Portuguese pilot on board,
who offered his service; we very gladly accepted him, and
sent the boat back again. And now, having the old man
on board, I talked to him of going to Nanquin, the most
northward part of the coast of China. "What will you do
there?" said he, smiling. I told him we would sell our
cargo, and purchase calicoes, raw and wrought silks, tea,
&c. and so return the same way back. "O," said he, "you
had better put in at Macao, where you may buy China wares
as cheap as at Nanquin, and sell your opium at a greater
advance." "But," said I, "we are gentlemen, as well as
merchants, and design to see the great cityofPekin, and
the magnificent court of the monarch of China." "Why,
then," said he, "you should go to Ningpo, where there is
a navigable river that goes through the heart of that vast
empire, two hundred and seventy leagues from the sea,
which crosses all the rivers, passes considerable hills, by
the help of the sluices and gates, and goes even up to the
city of Pekin. You may go to Nanquin, if you please, and
travel to Pekin, and there is a Dutch ship just before bound
that way." At the name ofa Dutch or English ship, I was
struck with confusion; they being as great a terror to me in this vessel, as an Algerine man of war is to them in the
Meuiterran!.an. The old man finding me troubled, "Sir,"
said. he, "I hope the Dutch are not now at war with your
nation." "No," said 1, "but God knows what liberty they
may take when out of the reach of the law." "Why," says he, "what occasion is there for peaceable merchants to fear?
for believe me, they never meddle with any but PIRATES 'f
At the mentioning the word Pirates, my countenance
turned to that of scarlet; nor was it possible forme to con-
ceal it from the old pilot; who taking notice of it, "Sir,"
said he, " take what course you please, I'll do you all the
service I can." "Seignior," said I, "I am a little con-
cerned at your mentioning pirates; I hope there are none
such in these seas, because you see in what weak condition we are to defend ourselves." "O, Sir," said he, " if that's
all, don't be concerned; I don't remember one in these seas
these fifteen years, except about a month ago, one was seen
in the bay of Siam, but he is gone to the southward; nei-
ther was she built for a privateer, but was run away with
by a reprobate captain, and some of his men, the right
captain having been murdered by the Malayans."
"What \" said I, (as though ignorant of what had hap-
pened) " did they kill the Captain i" " No,"said he, " it n
generally thought the Malayans murdered him; but perhaps
they might procure them to do.it, and therefore they justly
deserve hanging. The rogues were lately discovered in
the Bay of Siam, in the river of Cambodia, by some Dutch-
men who belonged to the ship, and had much ado to escape
the five boats that pursued them, but they have solemnly
sworn to give no quarter to the captain or the seamen, but
hang them every one up at the yard-arm, without any formal
business of bringing them to a court of judicature."
Being sensible, that, having the old man on board, he
was incapable of doing me any mischief, "Well, Seignior,"
said I, "it is for this very reason I would have you carry
us up to Nanquin, where neither English nor Dutch ships
come; and I must tell you, their captains are a parcel of
rash, proud, insolent rascals, that neither know what belongs
to justice, nor how to behave themselves as the laws of God
or nature direct; follows that would prove murderers to
punish robbers, and take upon them to adjudge innocent
men to death, without any proof to prove them guilty; bat
perhaps I may live to call them to account for it, in a place
where they may be taught how justice is to be executed."
And so 1 told him all the story of buying the ship, and how
we were saved by the means of two men: that the murder
of the Captain by the Malayans, as also the running away
with the ship, I believed to be true; but that we, who
bought it, were turned pirates, was a mere fiction, to cover
their cowardice and foolish behaviour, when they attacked
us; and the blood of those men we killed in our own just de-
fence lay at their door, who were sent to attack us by surprise.
"Sir," said the old man amazed, "you have taken the
right course to steer to the north, and if I might advise
you, I would have you sell your ship in China, and buy or
build another in that country; and I'll procure people to
buy the one and sell the other." "Well, but Seignior,"
said I, "if I sell the ship in this manner, I may bring some
innocent persons into the same dangers I have gone through,
perhaps worse, even death itself; whereby I should be as
guilty of their murder as their villanous executioners."—
"That need not trouble you," says the old man, " I'll find
a way to prevent that; for these commanders, you talk of,
I know very well, and will inform them rightly of the mat-
ter as you have related, and I am persuaded they will not
only believe me, but act more cautiously for the future."—
"And will you deliver one message from me to them -"
"Yes," said he, "if you will give it under your hand, that
I may prove it is not of my own production." Hereupon
I wrote a large account of their attacking me in their long-
-boat, the pretended reason and unjust design of it; that
they had done what they might be ashamed of, and could
not answer for at any tribunal in England. But this letter
was writ in vain. Providence ordered things another way.
We sailed directly for Nanquin, and in about thirteen days
sail, came to an anchor at the south-west point of the great
gulf of that place, where we learned, that two Dutch
ships were gone the length before us, and that we should
certainly fall into their hands. We were all at a great loss
in this exigency, and would very gladly have been on shore
almost any where; but our old pilot told me, that if I
would sail to the southward about two and forty leagues,
there was a little port called Quinchange, where no Euro-
pean ships ever came, and where we might consider what
was further to be done. Accordingly we weighed anchor
the next day, calling only twice on shore by the way to
get fresh water. The country people very courteously
sold us roots, tea, rice, fowls, and other provisions. After
five days sail we came to the port, and landed with unspeak-
able joy. We resolved to dispose of ourselves and effects
in any other way possible, than enteron board that ill-fated
vesset more; lor no state can be more miserable than a
continued fear, which is a life of death, a confounder of
our understandings, that sets the imagination at work to
form a thousand frightful things that may never happen.
And we scarce slept one night, withoutdreaming of halters,
yard arms', or gibbets, of fighting, being taken, and being
killed; nay, so violent were our apprehensions, that we
would bruise our hands and heads against the sides of the
cabin, as though actually engaged. The story of the Dutch cruelty at Amboyna, often came into our thoughts when
awake; and for my part, I thought my condition very
hard, that after so many difficulties and such signal deliver-
ances, I should be hanged in my old age, though innocent
of any crime that deserved such punishment; but then re-
ligion would seem to represent to me, as though the voice
of it had said, consider, O man! what sins you have been
formerly guilty of; which now thou art called to an account
for, to expiate with thy blood! and as to thy innocence,
what art thou more innocent than thy blessed redeemer Jesus Christ, who suffered for thy offences, and to whose
providence you ought to submit, let what will happen?
after this, natural courage would inspire me to resist to
the last drop of blood, and sooner die than suffer myself to
be taken by boorish, rascally Dutchmen, who had arts to
torment beyond death itself.
But now, thank kind heaven, being ashore, our old pilot
procured us a lodging and warehouse for our goods; it
was a little hut, with a large warehouse joining to it, all
built with canes, and pallisadoed round with large ones, to
keep out pilfering thieves, which are very numerous in that
country. The magistrates allowed us a little guard during
the night, and we employed a centinel with a kind of hal-
bert for threepence a day. The fair, or mart, we found
had been over for some time; however, there remained in
the river four junks and two Japan ships, the merchants of
the latter being on shore. In the first place, our old pilot
brought us acquainted with the missionary Roman priests,
who were converting the people to Christianity: two of
them were reserved, rigid, and austere, applying themselves
to the work they came about with great earnestness; but
the third, who was a Frenchman, called Father Simeon, was
of a freer conversation, not seemingly so serious and grave,
vet no worse Christian than the other two, 'one of whom
was a Portuguese, and thuother a Genoese. Father Simeon,
it seems, was appointed to go to Pekin, the royal seat of the emperor of the Chinese; and he only waited for ano-
ther priest, who was ordered from Macao to accompany
him. We never met together, but he was prompting me
to accompany' him in that journey: "Sir," said he, "I
will show you the glorious things of this mightv empire,
and a city,.the city of Pekin, far exceeding London and
Paiis, jnit them both together. One day in particular, be-
ing at dinnerwith him, I showed some inclination to go;
which made him press the more upon me and my partner,
to gain our perfect consent. "But, Father Simeon," said
my partntir, " what satisfaction can you have in our com-
pany whom you esteem as heretics, and consequently objects
not worthy your regard?" "O," said he," you may be as
good Catholics in time as those I hope to convert to our
religion." "And so,'' said I, "we shall have you preach-
ing to us all the way, instead of pleasing us with a descrip-
tion of the country." "Sir," said he, "however our reli-
gion may be villified by some people, it is very certain it
neither divests us of good manners or Christian charity;
and as we are gentlemen, as such we may converse toge-
ther, without making one another uneasy."
But we shall leave him awhile, to consider our ship and
the merchandise which we had to dispose of. There was
but very little trade in the place where we were; and I
was once resolved to venture to sail to the river Kilam, and
so to the city of Nanquin; but Providence ordered it other-
wise, by our old pilot's bringing a Japan merchant to us, to
see what goods we had. He immediately bought our opium,
for which he gave us a very good price in gold by weigh),
some wedges of which were about ten or eleven ounces.
It came into my head that perhaps he might buy the ship
too; and I ordtred his interpreter to propose it to him.—He said nothing then, but shrugged up his shoulders; yet
in a few days after he came, accompanied by a missionary
priest, who was his interpreter, with this proposal, "That
as he had bought a great quantity of our goods, he had not
money enough to purchase our ship; but if I pleased he
would hire her, with all my men, to go to Japan, and from
thence with another loading to the Philippine islands, the
freight of which he would very willingly pay to us before;
and at their return to Japan, would buy the ship." Upon
this we asked the captain and his men, if they were willing
to go to Japan; to which they unanimously agreed. While
this was in agitation, the young man my nephew left to
attend me, told me, "That as I did not care to accept this
prospect of advantage, he would manage it for me as I
pleased, and render me a faithful account of his success,
which would be wholly mine." Indeed I was very unwil-
ling to part with him; but considering it might be for the young man's good, I discoursed with my partner about it,
who of his own generosity, gave him his share of the vessel,
so that I could do no otherwise than give him mine: but,
however we let him have but the proper half of it, and
preserved a power, that when we met in England if he
had obtained success, he should account to us for one half of
the profits of the ship's freight, and the other should be his
own. Thus having taken a writing under his hand, away
he sailed to Japan, where the merchant dealt very honestly
by him, got him a licence to come on shore, sent him loaded
to the Philippines with a Japanese supercargo, from whence
he came back again loaded with European goods, cloves, and
other spices. By this voyage he cleared a considerable
sum of money, which determined him not to sell his ship,
but to trade on his own account; so he returned to the Ma-
nillas, where, getting acquaintance, he made his ship free,
was hired by the governor privately to go to Acapulco in
America, on the Mexican coast, with a licence to travel to
the great city of Mexico. This traffic turned out greatly
to account, and my friend finding means to get to Jamaica, returned nine years after exceedingly rich into England.
In parting with the ship, it comes in course to consider
of those men who had saved our lives when in the river of
Cambodia; and though, by the way, they were a couple of
rogues, who thought to turn pirates themselves, yet we
paid them what they had before demanded, and gave each
of them a small sum of money, making the Englishman a
gunner, and the Dutchman a boatswain, with which they
were very well contented.
We were now about 1000 leagues fart her from home,
than when at Bengal.. All the comfort we could expect
was, that there being another fair to be kept in a month's
time, we might not only purchase all sons of that country's
manufactures, hut very possibly find some Chinese junks,
or vessels from Tonquin, to be sold, which would carry us
and our goods wheresoever we pleased. Upon these hopes,
we resolved to continue; and to divert ourselves, we took
several little journies in the country. About ten days after
we parted with our ship, we travelled to see the city oi'
Kanquin. The city lies in latitude 30 degrees^ north o&he
line: it is regularly built, and the streets are exactly straight,
Hi.d cross ore another in direct lines, which sets it out to
the greatest advantage. At our return, we found the priest was come from Macao, that was to accompany father Si-
meon to Pekin. That father earnestly solicited me to ac-
company him, and i referred him to my partner. In short,
we both agreed, and prepared accordingly; and we were
so lucky as to have liberty to travel among the retinue of
one of their Mandarines, who is a principal magistrate, and
much reverenced by the people.
We were five and {wen tv day stravelling through this miser-
able country, infinitely populous, but as indifferently cul-
tivated; and yet their pride is infinitely greater than their
poverty, insomuch that the priests themselves deride them.
As we passed by the house of one of their country gentle-
men, two leagues off Nanquin, we had the honour, forsooth,
-to ride with the Chinese squire about two miles. Never
was Don Quixote so exactly imitated! never such a com-
pound of pomp and poverty seen before 1
His habit, made of calico, was dirty, greasy, and very
proper for a Merry Andrew or Scaramouch, with all its
tawdry trappings, as hanging sleeves, tassels, &c. though
torn and rent in almost every part; his vest underneath it
was no less dirty, but more greasy, resembling the most ex-
quisite sloven or greasy butcher: his horse (worse than Ro-
sinante, or the fumous steed of doughty Hudibras) was a
poor starved, decrepid thing, that would not sell for thirty
shillings in England; and yet this piece of worshipful pomp
was attended with ten or twelve slaves who guarded their
master to his country seat. We stopped at a little village
for refreshment; and when we came by the country-seat of
this great man, we found him sitting under a tree before his
door, eating a mess of boiled rice, with a great piece of
garlic in the middle, and a bag filled with green pepper by
him, and another plant like ginger, together with a piece
of lean mutton in it: this was his worship's repast: but
pray observe the state of the food ', two women slaves brought
him his food, which being laid before him, two others ap-
peared to perform their respective offices; one fed him
with a spoon, while the other scraped off what fell upon his
beard and taffety vest, and gave it to a particular favourite
to eat. And thus we left the wretch pleased with the con-
ceit ofour admiring his magnificence, which rather merited
our scorn and detestation.
At length we arrived at the great city of Pekin, accom-
panied by two servants, and the old Portuguese pilot, whose U2
charges we bore, and who served us as an interpreter by
the way. We had scarce been a week at Pekin, but he
comes laughing to us, "Ah! Seignior Inglise," said he,
"me something tell you make your heart glad, but make
me sorry; for you bring me here twenty-five days journey,
and now you leave me go back alone j and which way
shall I make my port after, without de ship, without de
horse, without pecune I" so he called money in his broken
Latin. He then informed me, that there was a great ca-
ravan of Muscovite and Polish merchants in the city, who
were preparing to set out for Muscovy by land within six
weeks; and, that he was certain we would take this oppor-
tunity, and consequently that he must gohome by himself.
Indeed this news infinitely surprised and pleased me.—
"Are you certain of this ?" said I. "Yes, Sir," says he,
"me sure it's true." And so he told me that having met
an old acquaintance of his, an Armenian, in the street, who
was among them, and who had come from Astracan, with
a design to go to Tonquin, but for certain reasons having
altered his resolutions, he was now resolved to go with the
caravan, and to return by the river Wolga to Astracan.—
"Well, Seignior," said 1, "don't be discontented about
your returning alone: and if, by this means, I can find a
passage to England, it will be your own fault if you return
to Macao at all." And so consulting with my partner what
was best to be done, he referred it to me as I pleased, hav-
ing our affairs so well settled at Bengal, that, if he could
convert the good voyage he had made in China silks,
wrought or raw, he would be satisfied to go to England,
and so return to Bengal in the company's ships. Thus re-
solved, we agreed that if our pilot would go with us, we
would bear his charges either to Moscow or England; and
to give him in a present the sum of one hundred and seventy
pounds sterling. Hereupon we called him in, and told
him the cause of his complaint should be removed, if he
would accompany us with the caravans; and, therefore, we
desired to know his mind. At this he shook his head,
"Great long journey," said he, "me no pecune carry me
to Moscow, or keep me there." But we soon put him out
of that concern, by making him sensible of what we would
give him here to lay out to the best advantage; and, as for
his charges, we would set him sale on shore, God willing,
either in Muscovy or England, as he pleased, at our own charge, except the carriage of his goods. At this proposal,
he was like a man transported, telling us, he would go with
us all the world over; and we made preparations for our
journey; but it was near four months before all the mer-
chants were ready.
In the mean time, my partner and the pilot went express
to the port where me first put in, to dispose of what goods
had been left there, while I accompanied a Chinese mer-
chant who was going to Nanquin, and there bought twenty-
nine pieces of damask, with about three hundred more of
other fine silks; and by the time my partner returned to
Pekin, I had them all carried thither; our cargo in silks
amounted to 4-5001. sterling, which, together with tea, fine
calicoes, nutmegs, and cloves, loaded eighteen camels for
our share, besides what we rode upon, with two or three
spare horses, and two more loaded with provisions; the
company now was very great, making about four hundred
horse, and above one hundred and twenty men, well armed and provided. We were of several nations, among whom
were five Scotch merchants, inhabiting in Moscow, and
well experienced in trade.
We set out from Pekin the beginning of February, our.
style; and in two days inore, We passed through the gate
of the great China wall, which was erected as a fortifica-
tion against the Tartars, being one hundred English miles
Iong. We then entered a country not near so populous,
chiefly under the power of plundering Tartars, several com-
panies of whom we perceived riding on poor starved horses,
contemptible as themselves, without order or discipline.—One time our leader, for the day gave us leave to go a hunting; but what do you think we hunted r only a parcel
of sheep, which indeed exceeded any in the world for wildness and swiftness; but while we were pursuing this game, it was our chance to meet with about forty Tartars, who
no sooner perceived us, but one of them blew a horn,.at
the sound of which there soon appeared a troop of forty or
fifty more, at about a mile's distance. Hereupon one of the Scotch merchants (who knew their ways) ordered us to
advance towards them, and attack them immediately. As
we advanced, they let fly a volley of arrows, which happi'y.
fell a little short of us; this made us halt a little, to return
the compliment with bullets; and then being led up by U J
the bold Scot, we fired our pistols in their faces, and drew
'nitour swords; but there was no occasion; for they flew
like timorous sheep, and only three of them remained,
beckoning to the rest to come back. But our brave com-
mander gallopped up to them by himself, shot one dead,
knocked another off' his horse, while the third ran away;
and thus ended our battle with the Tartars. We travelled a month more through the Emperor of
China's dominions; and at length coming to one of their
towns about a day and a half's journey from the city of
Naum, I wanted to buy a camel. The person 1 spoke to
would have brought me one, but, like a fool, I must go
along with him, about two miles from the village. My
old pilot and I walked on foot, forsooth, for some variety,
vi hen coming to the place where the camelswere kept as
in a park guarded by Chinese soldiers, ve there agreed
and bought one, which the Chinese man that came along
with me led along the road. But we had not gone far, be-
fore we were attacked by five Tartars, mounted on horse-
hack, two of whom seized the man, took the camel from
him, and rode awa\, while the other three approached us, the first of whom suddenly seized me as I was drawing my
sword, the second knocked me down, but my old trusty
Portuguese, taking a pistol out of his pocket, which I knew
nothing of, and coming up to the fellow that struck me, he
with one hand pulled him offhis horse, and then shot him
dead upon the spot; then taking his scymitar, he struck
at the man that stopped us, but missing him, cutoff one of
his horse's ears, the pain of which made him throw his
rider to the ground. The poor Chinese who had led the
camel, seeing the Tartar down, runs to him, and seizing
upon his pole-ax, wrenched it from his hands, and knocked
his brains out. But there was another Tartar to deal with,
who seeming neither inclined to fight nor fiy, and my old
man having begun to charge his pistol, the sight of it struck
such a terror into the wretch, that away he scoured, leav-
ing my old pilot, rather my champion and defender, an
absolute victory.
By this time being awakened from my trance, I began
to open n y eves, wondering where I was, having quite
forgot all thai gassed; but my senses returning, and feeling
a great pain in my head, and seeing the blood was running
over my clothe?, i insiar.tly jumped upon my lett, ar.J
grasped my sword in my hand, with a resolution to take re-
venge: but no enemies now remained, except the dead
Tartar, with his horse standing by him. The old man
seeing me recovered, whom he thought slain, ran towards
me, and embraced me with the greatest tenderness, at the
same time examining into my wound, which was far from
being mortal. When we returned to the village, the man
demanded payment for his camel, which I refusing, we
brought the cause before a Chinese judge, who acted with
great impartiality: having heard both sides, he asked the
Chinese man that went with me, whose servant he was?
"Sir," said he, "I am nobody's, bat went with the stran-
ger at his request:" " Why then," said the judge, "you
are the stranger's servant for the time, and the camel be-
ing delivered to his servant, it is the same as though de-
livered to himself, and accordingly he must pay for it."—Indeed the case was so fairly stated, that I had nothing ip
object to it; so having paid for that I was robbed of, I sent for another, but did not go myself to fetch it, as I had
enough of that sport before.
The city of Naum is a frontier of the Chinese Empire, so
fortified, as some will tell you, that millions of Tartars cannot batter down their walls; by which certainly one might
think one of our cannons would do more execution than'all
their legions.
When we were within a day's march of that city, we
had information that the governor had sent messengers to
every part of the road, to inform the travellers and caravans
to halt, till a guard was sent to protect them from the nu-
merous bodies of Tartars that lately appeared about the
city. This news put us into great consternation: but
obeying the orders, we stopt; and two days after, there
came two hundred soldiers from a garrison of the Chinese,
and three hundred more from Naum; thus guarded both
in the front and rear, with our own men in the flanks, we
boldly advanced, thinking we were able to combat with
ten thousand Mogul Tartars, if they appeared.
Early next.morning, in our march from a little well situ-
ated town called Changu, after having passed a river and
entered upon a desert of about fitte. n or sixteen mi:es over
we soon beheld, by a cloud of dust that was raised, that
the enemy was approaching. This much dispirited the
Chinese. My old pilot took notice of it, and culled out
"Seignior Inglise, those fellows must be encouraged, or thej
wjll ruin us all; and I am afraid if the Tartars attack us,
they will all run away." "Why, Seignior," said I, "what
shall be done in this case?" "Done," says he, "why let
fifty of our men advance, and flank them on each wing. I
know the fellows will fight well enough in company. We
accordingly took his advice, and marched fifty to the right
wing, and the same number to the left, and with the rest
made a line of reserve, leaving the last two hundred men
to guard the camels, or to assist us, as occasion required.
Thus prepared, a party of the enemy came forward, view-
ing our posture, and traversing the ground on the front of
our line. Hereupon we ordered the two wings to move
on, and give them a salute with their shot; which accordingly was done. This put a stop to their proceedings;
for immediately wheeling off to their left, they all marched
away, and we saw no more of them. They had undoubtedly
given an account to their companions of what reception
they might expect, which made them so easily give over
their enterprize.
When we came to the city of Naum, we returned the
governor hearty thanks, and distributed a hundred crowns
among the soldiers that guarded us. We rested there one
day, and then proceeded on our travel?, passing several
great rivers and deserts; and on the 13th of April we came
to the frouliers of Muscovy, the first town of which was
called Argun.
This happy occasion, as I thought, of coming into a
Christian country, made me congratulate the Scotch mer-
chant upon it. He smiled at that, telling me not to rejoice
too soon; "fo*,'t said he, "except the Russian soldiers in
garrison, and a few inhabitants of the cities upon the road,
all the rest of this country, for above a thousand miles, is
inhabited by the most ignorant and barbarous Pagans."
We advanced from the river Arguna by moderate jour-
nies, and found convenient garrisons on the road, filled with
Christian soldiers, for tfie security of commerce, and for
the convenient lodgings of travellers: but the mhabitants
of the country were mere Pagans, worshipping the sun, moon,
ar.d stars. We particularly observed this idolatry near the
river Arguna, at a city inhabited by Tartars and Russians,
called Nerisinkey. Being curious to see their way of liv-
ing while the caravan continued to rest themselves in that city, I went to one of their villages, where there was
to be one of their solemn sacrifices. There I beheld,
upon the stump ot an old tree, an idol of wood, more ugly
than the representation of the devil himself: its head
resembling no living creature; its ears were as big and as
high as goats' horns, a crooked nose, four cornered mouth,
and horrible teeth: it was clothed in sheep-skins, had a
great Tartar bonnet, with two horns growing through it,
and was eight feet high, without feut, legs, or proportion. Before this idol there lay sixteen or seventeen people. who
brought their offerings, and were making iheir prayer.*,
while at a distance stood three men, and one bullock, as
victims to this ugly monster.
Such stupendous sacrilege as this in robbing the true God of his honour, filled me with the greatest astonishment
and reflection: which soon turmng to rage and Jury, I rode
up to the image, and cut in pieces th/; bonnet that was upon
his head with my sword, so that it hung down by one of
the horns, while one of my men that was with me pulled at
it by his sheep skin garment. Immediately an hideous
howling and outcry ran through the village, and two or three hundred people coining about our ears, we were
obliged to fly for it.
But I had not done with the monster; for the caravan
being to rest three nights in the town, I told the Scotch mer-
chant what I had seen, and that 1 was resolved to take four or five men well armed with me, in order to destroy the
idol, and show the people how liitle reason they had to trust
in a god who could not save himself. At first he laughed
at me, representing the danger of it; and when it was
destroyed, what time had we to preach to them better
things, whose zeal and ignorance was in the greatest degree,
and both unparalleled i that if I should be taken by them, I
should be served as a poor Ruflian who condemned their
worship; that is, to be stripped naked, and tied to the top
of the idol, there shot at with arrows till my body was lull
of them, and then burnt as a sacrifice to the monster; "but
Sir," said he, "since your zeal carries you so far, rathtr
than you should be alone I will accompany you, and bring
a stout fellow equal to yourself, if you will, to assist you in
this design:" and accsrdingly he brought one captain Rich-
ardson, who, hearing the story, readily consented; but my
partner declined it, being altogether out of his way: and
so we three, and my servant, resolved, to execute this ex-
plott about midnight; but upon second thoughts we defer-
red it to the next night, by reason that the caravan being
to go from hence the next morning, we should be out of
the governor's power. The better to effectuate my design,
1 procured a Tartar's sheep-skin robe, a bonnet, with bow
and arrows, and everyone of us got the like habits. The
first night we spent in mixing combustible matter with aqua-
vit,E, gunpowder, &c. having a good quantity of tar in a
little pot: next ni^ht we came up to the idol about eleven
o'clock, the moon being up. We found none guarding
it; but we perceived a light in the house, where we had
seen thepriests before. One of our men was for firing the
hut, another for killing the people, and a third for mak-
ing them prisoners, while the idol was destroyed. We
agreed to the latter; so knocking at the door, we seized
the first that opened it, and stopping his mouth and tying
his feet, we left him. We served the other two in the like
manner; and then the Scotch merchant set fire to the com-
position, which frightened them so much that we brought
them all away prisoners to their wooden god. There we
fell to work with him, daubing him all over with tar mixed
with tallow and brimstone, stopping his eyes, ears, and
mouth full of gunpowder, with a great piece of wild fire in
his bonnet, and environed it with dry forage. All this be-
ing done, we unloosed and ungagged the prisoners, and set
the idol on fire, which the gunpowder blowing up, the
shape of it was deformed, rent and split, which the forage
utterly consumed: for we stayed to see its destruction, lest
the ignorant, idolatrous people should have thrown them-
selves into the flames. And thus we came away undisco-
vered, in the morning appearing as busy among our fellow
travellers, as nobody could have suspected any other, but
that we had been in our beds all night.
Next morning we set out, and had gone but a small
distance from the city, when there came a multitude of
people of the country to the gates of the city, demanding
satisfaction of t he Russian governor for insulting their priest *,
and burning their great Cham Chi-Thaungu, who dwelt in
the sun, and no mortal would violate this image but some
Christian miscreants; and being already no less than thirty
thousand strong, they announced war against him and all
his Christians.
The governor assured them he was ignorant of the matter, and that none of his garrison had been abroad; that in-
deed there was a caravan that went away that morning, and
that he would send after them to inquire into it; and who-
ever was the offender, should be delivered into their hands.
This satisfied them for the present, but the governor sent
to inform us, that if any of us had done it, we should make
all the haste away possible, while he kept them in play as
long as he could. Upon this we marched two days and
two nights, stopping but very little, till at last we arrived
at a village called Plothus, and hastened to Jarawena, another
of the Czar's colonies. On the third day, having entered
the desert, and passed the lake called Shaks Oser, we be-
held a numerous body of horse on the other side of it to the
north, who supposed we had passed on that side the lake;
but either having found the mistake, or being certainly in-
formed of the way we took, they came upon us towards the
dusk of the evening, just as we had pitched our camp be-
tween two little but very thick woods, with a little river
running before our front and some felled trees with which
we covered our rear; a precaution we always took, and
which we had just finished when the enemy came up.—They did not fall on us immediately, but sent three messen-
gers, demanding the men who had insulted their priests,
and burnt their god Cham Chi-Thaungu, that they might
be burnt with fire; that if this was complied with, they
would peaceably depart; but if not, they would de-
stroy one and all of us. Our men stared at one another
on receipt of this message, but nobody was the word, as
indeed nobody knew it, but he who did it. Upon which
the leader of the caravan returned for answer, "That they
were peaceable merchants, who meddled with none of then-
priests and gods; and therefore desired them not to disturb
us, and put us under the necessity of defending ourselves."
But so far was this from satisfying them, that the next morning coming to our right, they fet fly a volley of arrows among
us, which happily did not hurt any, because we sheltered
ourselves behind our baggage. We expected however to
come to closer engagement: but were happily saved by
a cunning fellow, a Cossack, who obtaining leave of the
leader to go oul, mounts his horse, rides directly from our
rear, and taking a circutt, comes up to the Tartars, as
though he had been sent express, andtells them a formal
story, that the wretches who had burnt the Cham Chi-
Tliaungu, were gone to Shihcilka, with a resolution to burn Ihe
god Shal-Isar, belonging to the Tongueses. Upon which,
believing this cunning Tartar, who was servant to our Mus-
covites, away they drove toShiheilka, and in less than three
minutes were out of sight, nor did we ever hear of them more.
When we came to the city of Jarawena, we rested five
days, and then entered into a frightful desert, which held us
twenty three days march, infested with several small com-
panies of robbers, or Mogul Tartars, who never had the
courage to attack us. After we had passed over this desert,
we found several garrisons to defend the caravans from the
violence of the Tartars: in particular the governor of Adin-
skoy offered us a guard of fifty men to the next station, if
we apprehended any danger. The people here retained
the same paganism and barbarity, only they were not so
dangerous, being conquered by the Muscovites. The cloth-
ing, both of men and women, is.of the skins of beasts, living
under the ground in vaults and caves, which have a com-
munication with one another. They have idols almost in
every family; besides, they adore the sun and stars, water
and snow; and the least uncommon thing that happens in
the elements alarms them as much as thunder and lightning
does the unbelieving Jews.
Nothing remarkable occurecl in our march through this
country. When we had gone through the desert, after two
days farther travel, we came to Jenezoy, a Muscovite city,
on the great river so called, which we were told rrarted Eu-
rope from Asia. The inhabitants here were very little bet-
ter, though intermixed with the Muscovites, but the won-
der will cease, when I inform my reader of what was ob-
served to me, that the Czar rather converts the Tartars
with soldiers than clergymen, and is more proud to make
them faithful subjects, than good Christians.
From this city to the river Oby, we travelled over a
pleasant, fruitful, but very uncultivated country, for want
ofgood management and people, and those few are mostly
Pagans. This is the place where the Muscovite criminals
are banished to, if they are not put to death. The next
city we came to, was the capital city of Siberia, called To-
bolski, when having been almost seven months on our jour-
ney, and winter drawing on apace, my partner and I con-
sulted about our particular affairs, in what manner we should
dispose of ourselves. We had been told of sledges and
rem-deer to carry us over the snow in the winter season,
6
the snow being frozen so hard, that the sledges can run
upon the surface without any danger of going down. As I was bound to England, I now behoved either to go with the
Caravan to Jereslaw, from thence west to Narva, and the
gulf of Finland, and so by land or sea to Denmark; or
else I must leave the caravan at a tittle town on the Dwina,
and so to Archangel, where I was certain of shipping either
to England, Holland, or Hamburgh. One night I happened
to get into the company of an illustrious, but banished Prince,
whose company and virtues were such as made me pro-
pose to him a method how he might obtain his liberty.—
"My dear friend," said he, "as 1 am here happily free from
my miserable greatness, with all its attendants of pride, am-
bition, avarice, and luxury, if I should escape from this place,
those pernicious seeds may again revive, to my lasting dis-
quietude; therefore let me remain in a blessed confinement,
lor I am but flesh, a mere man, with passionsand affections
as such; O be not my friend and tempter too r" Struck
dumb with surprise, I stood silent awhile; nor was he less
in disorder, by which perceiving he wanted to give vent to
his mind, I desired him to consider of it, and so withdrew.
But about two hours after he came to my apartment: "Dear
friend," said he, "though I cannot consent to accompany
you, I shall have this satisfaction in parting, that you leave
me an honest man still; but as a testimony of my affection
to you, be pleased to accept this present of sables."
In return for his compliment; I sent my servant next
morning to his lordship with a small present of tea, two
pieces of China damask, and four little wedges of gold;
hut he only accepted the tea, one piece of damask, and one
piece of gold, for the curiosity of the Japan stamp that was
upon it. Not long after he sent for me, and told me that
what he had refused himself, he hoped, upon his account, I
would grant to another, whom he should name: In short it
was his only son, who was about two hundred miles distant
from him, on the other side of the city, whom he said he
would send for, if j gave my consent. This I soon com-
plied with; upon which he sent his servant next day for
in> son, who returned in twenty days time, bringing seven
horses loaded with valuable furs. At night the young lord was conducted incognito into our apartment, where his fa--
ther presented him to me. We then concerted the best
X
\vays for travelling, and after having bought a considerable
quantity of sables, black fox skins, fine ermines, &c.
fwhich I sold at Archangel at a good price) we set out from
this city the beginning ofJune, making a small caravan,be-
ing about thirty-two horses and camels, of which I repre-
sentecTlhe head. My young lord had with him a very
faithful Siberian servant, well acquainted with the roads.
We shunned the principal towns and cities, asTumen, Soli
Kamoskoi, and several others, by reason of their strictness
in examining travellers, lest any of the banished persons of
distinction should escape. Having passed the river Kama,
we came to a city on the European side, called Soloy Ka-
mosko., where we found the people mostly Pagans asbefore.
\Ve then passed a desert of about two hundred miles over;
but in other places it is near seven hundred. In passing
this wild place, we were beset by a troop of men on horse-
back, and about five and forty men armed with bows and
arrows. At first they looked earnestly on us, and then
placed themselves in our way. We wire above sixteen
men, and drew up a little line before our camels. My
young lord sent out his Siberian servant, to know who
they were; but, when he approached them, he neither
knew a word they said, nor would they admit him to come
near them at his peril, but prepared to shoot him. At his
return, he told us he believed them to be Calmuck Tar-
tars; and that there were more upon the desert. This was
but a small comfort to us; yet seeing a little grove, about
a quarter of a mile distant, we moved to it, by the old
Portuguese pilot's advice, without meeting with any oppo-
sition. Here we found a marshy piece of ground, and a
spring of water running into a little brook on one side,
which joined another like it a little farther off, and these
two formed the head of the river called^Vritska. As soon
as we arrived, we went to work, cutting great arms oft the
trees, and laying them hanging not quite off from one tree
to another. In this situation we waited the motion of the
enemy, without perceiving any advancement they made
towards us. About two hours bef,re night, being joined by some other?, in ail about fourscore horses, among whom
we fancied were some women, they came upon us with great
fur\. V\'e tired without ball, calling to them in the Russian
tongue, to know their business;. but they either not know-
ing, or seeming not to understand us, came directly to the 
6
. wood-side, not considering that we were so fortified, as that
they could not break in. Our old pilot, the Portuguese,
proved both our captain and engineer, and desired us not
to fire till they came within pistol shot; and when he gave
the word of command, then to take the surestaim; but he
didnotbidus give fire, till they were within two pikes length
of us, and then we killed fourteen of them, wounded seve-
ral, as also their horses, having every one of us loaded our
pieces with two or three bullets at least. So much were
they surprised at our undauntedness, that they retired about
a hundred roods from us. In the mean while we loaded
our pieces again, and sallying out, secured four or five of
their horses, whose riders we found were killed, and per-
ceived them'to be Tartars. About an hour after, they
made another attempt, to see where they might break iii; .
but finding us ready to receive them, they retired.
All that night we wrought hard, in strengthening our
situation, and barricading the entrance into the woods;
but when daylight came we made a very unwelcome dis-
covery; for the enemy being encouraged by their num-
bers, had set up eleven or twelve tents, in form of ac"amp,
about three quarters of a mile from us. I must confess, I
was never more concerned in my life, giving myself and
all that I had over for lost. And my partner declared, that
as the loss of his goods would be his ruin, before they should
be taken from him, he would fight to the last drop of his
blood. As we could not pretend to force our way, we had
recourse to a stratagem; we kindled a large fire, which
burnt all night; and no sooner was it dark, but we pursued
our journey towards the pole or north star; and travelling
all night, by six o'clock in the morning we came to a Rus-
sian village, called Kertza, and from thence came to a large
town named Ozonzoys, where we heard that several troops
of Calmuck Tartars had been abroad upon the desert, but
that we were past all danger. In five days after we came
to Veuslima, upon the river Witzedga; from thence we
came to Lawrenskoy, on the third of July, where, provid-
ing ourselves with two luggage boats, and a convenient
bark, we embarked the seventh, and arrived at Archangel
the eighteenth, after a year, five months,,and three days
journey, including the eight months and odd days at To-
bolsjti. We came from Archangel the 20th of August in X 2.
the same year, and arrived at Hamburgh the 30th of Sep-
tember. Here my partner and I made a very good sale of
our goods, both those of China and Siberia; when, dividing
our effects, my share came to 34751. 17s. 3d. after all the
losses we had sustafned, and charges we had been at.—Here the young lord took his leave of me, in order to go
to the court of Vienna, not only to seek protection, but to
correspond with his father's friends. After we had staid
four months in Hamburgh, I went from thence over-land
to the Hague, where embarking in the packet, 1 arrived in
London the I Oth of January, 170i, after ten years and nine
months absence from England.
VISION OF THE ANGELIC WORLD.
CHAF. I.
OF SOLITUDE.
HOWEVER solitude is looked upon as a restraint to the
pleasure of the world, in company and conversation, yet it
is a happy state of exemption from a sea of trouble, an
inundation of vanity and vexation, of confusion and disap-
pointment. While we enjoy ourselves, neither the joy nor
sorrow of other men affect us.: We are then at liberty,
with the voice of our soul, to speak to God. By this we
shun such frequent trivial discourse, as often becomes an ob-
struction to virtue: and how often do we find that we hail
reason to wish we had not been in company, or said nothing
when we were there? for either we offend God by the im-
piety of our discourse, or lay ourselves open to the violence
of designing people by our unguarded expressions; and
frequently feel the coolness and treachery of pretended
friends, when once involved in trouble and affliction; of
such unfaithful intimates, (I should say enemies) who rather
by false inuendoes would accumulate miseries upon us, than
honestly assist us when under thehard hand of adversity.
But in a state of solitude, when our tongues cannot be heard,
except from the great Majesty of Heaven, how happy are
we, in the blessed enjoyment of conversing with our Ma-
ker! it is then we make him our friend, which sets us above the envy and contempt of wicked men. When a man converses with himself, he is sure that he does not
converse with an enemy. Our retreat should be to good
company, and good books. I mean not by solitude, that
a man should retire into a cell, a desert, or a monastery:
which would be altogether an useless and unprofitable re-
straint: for as men are formed for society, and have an
absolute necessity and dependence upon one another, so
there is a retirement of the soul, with which it converses in
heaven, even in the midst of men; and indeed no man is
more fit to speak freely, than he who can, without any
violence to himself, refrain his tongue, or keep silence atto- -gether. As to religion, it is by this the soul gets acquaint-
ed with the hidden mysteries of the holy writings; here
she finds those floods of tears, in which good men wash themselves day and night, and only makes a visit to God, and his holy angels. In this conversation the truest peace and
most solid joy are to be found; it is a continual feast of
contentment on earth, and the means of attaining everlast-.-ing happiness hi heaven.
CHAP. II.,
OF HONESTY^.
Honesty is a virtue beloved by good men, and pretended
to by all other persons. In this there are several degrees: to pay every man his own is the common law of honesty;
but to do good to all mankind, is the chancery law of ho-
nesty; and this chancery-court is in every man's breast,
where his conscience is a Lord Chancellor. Hence it" is,
that a miser, though he pays every body their own, cannot
be an honest man, when he does not discharge the good
offices that are incumbent on a friendly, kind, and generous
person: for, saith the prophet Isaiah, chap, xxxii. ver, 7, 8.
"The instruments of a churl are evil: he deviseth wicked
devices to destroy the poor with lying words, even when
the needy speaketh right. But the liberal soul deviseth
liberal things, and by liberal things shall he stand." It is
certainly honest to do every thing the law requires; but
should we throw every poor debtor into prison till he has X3
paid the utmost farthing, hr.ng every malefactor without
mercy, exact the penalty of every bond, and the forfeiture
of every indenture, this would be downright cruelty, and
not honesty; and it is contrary to that general rule, "To do
to another, that which you would havedone unto you." Some-
times necessity makes an honest man a knave; and a rich
man an honestman, because he has no occasion to be a knave.
The trial of honesty is this: did you ever want bread, and
had your neighbour's loaf in keeping, and would starve ra-
ther than eat it? were you ever arrested, having in your
custody another man's cash, and would rather go to gaol,
than break it? if so, this indeed may be reckoned honesty.
For King Solomon tells us, "That a good name is better
than life, and is a precious ointment, and which, when a
man has once lost, he has nothing left worth keeping."
CHAP. III.
Of tlie pment sMr if RELIGION in the World.
I doubt, indeed, there is much more devotion than reli-
gion in the world; more adoration than supplication; and
more hypocrisy than sincerity: and it is very melancholy
to consider, what numbers of people there are furnished
with the powers of reason and gifts of nature, and yet aban-
doned to the grossest ignorance and depravity. But it would
be uncharitable for us to imagine (as some Papists, abound-
ing with too much ill-nature, the only scandal to religion,
do) that they will certainly be in a state of damnation after
this life; for how can we think it consistent with the mercy
and goodness of an. infinite Being, to damn those creatures,
when he has not furnished them with the light of the gos-
pel - or how can such proud, conceited, and cruel bigots,
prescribe rules to the justice and mercy of God?
We are told by some people, that the great image which
king Nebuchadnezzar set up to be adored by his people,
held the representation of the sun in its right hand, as the
principal object of adoration. But to wave this discourse of
Heathens, how many self-contradicting principles are there
held among Christians? and how do we doom one another
to the devil, while all profess to worship the same deity, and to expect the same salvation?
When I was at Portugal, there was held at that time the
court of justice of the inquisition. All the criminals were
carried in procession to the great church, where eight of
them were habited in gownsand caps of canvas, whereon
the torments of hell were displayed, and they were con-
demned and burnt for crimes against the catholic faith and
blessed Virgin.
I am sorry to make any reflections upon Christians; but, indeed in Italy the Roman religion seems the most cruel and mercenary upon earth; and a very judicious person, who travelled through Italy from Turkey, tells, "That
"there is only the face and outward pomp of religion there:
"that the church protects murderers and assassins, and
"then delivers the civil magistrates over to Satan for doing
"justice; interdicts whole kingdoms, and shuts up the
'churches for want of paying a few ecclesiastical dues, and
'so puts a stop to religion for want of their money: that
'the court of inquisition burnt two men for speaking dis-
'honourably of the blessed Virgin; and the missionaries
'of China tolerated the worshipping thedevil by their new
'converts: that Italy was the theatre, where religion was.
'the grand opera; and that the popish clergy were no
* oth'er than the stage players."
As to religion in Poland, they deny Christ to be the
Messiah, or that the Messiah has come in the flesh. And
as to their Protestants, they are the followers of Laelius
Socinus, who denied our Saviour's divinity; and have no
concern about the divine inspiration of the Holy Ghost.
In Muscovy their churches are built of wood, and, in-
deed, they have but wooden priests,'though of the Greek
church; they pray as much to saint Nicholas, as the Papists
do to the Virgin Mary, for protection in all their difficulties
or afflictions.
As to Lutherans, they only differ from the Romans in
believing consubstantiation, instead of transubstantiation;
but, like them, they are much pleased with the external gal-
lantry and pomp, more than the true and real practice of it.
In France I found a world of priests, the streets every
where crowded with them, and the churches full of women:
but surely never was a nation so full of blind guides, so ig-
norant of religion, and even so void of morals, as those
people who confess their sins to them.
Does it not seem strange, that, while all men own the
divine Being, there should be so many different opinions as to the manner of paying him obedience in the Christian
church? I know not what reason to assign for this, except
it be their different capacities and faculties.
And, indeed, upon this account, we have perceived, in
all Christian countries, what mortal feuds have beerf about
religion; what wars and bloodshed have molested Europe,
till the general pacification of the German troubles at the
treaty of Westphalia, and since those times, what persecu-
tion in the same country among the churches of the Lutherans; and should I take a prospect at home, what unhappy
divisions are between Christians in this kingdom, about
Episcopacy and Presbytery; the church of England and
the Dissenters opposing one another like St. Paul and St.
Peter, even to the face; that is, they carry on the dispute
to the utmdst extremity.
It might be a question, why there are such differences in
religious points, and why these breaches should be more hot
and irreconcilable? All the answer I can give to this, is,
that we inquire more concerning the truth of religion, than
any other nation in the world; and the anxious concern we
have about it, makes us jealous of every opinion and tenacious of our own; and this is not because we are niore
furious and rash than other people; but the truth is, we are
more concerned about them, and being sensible that the
scripture is the great rule of faith, the standard for life and
doctrine, we have recourse to it ourselves, without subuiit-
tiijg to any pretended infallible judge upon earth.
There is another question, pertinent to the former, and
that is, what remedy can we apply to this malady? And to
this I must negatively answer, not to be less religious, that
we may differ the less. This is striking at the very root of
all religious differences; fur, certaioiy, were they to be
carried on with a peaceable spirit, willing to be informed,
our variety of opinions would not have the name of differ-
ences; nor should we separate in communion of charity, though we did not agree in several articles of religion.
Nor is there a less useful question to start, namely, where will our unhappy religious differences end? to which, I
hope, I may answer, in heaven; there all unchristian and unbrotherly differences will find a period; there we shall
embrace many a sinner, that here we think it a dishonour
to converse with; and perceive many a heart we have bro-
ken here with censures, reproachings, and revilings, made
whole again by the balm of the same Redeemer's blood
L
Here we shall perceive there have been other flocks than
those of our fold; that those we have excommunicated have
been taken into that superior communion; and in a word,
that those contradicting notions and principles which we
thought inconsistent with true religion, we shall then find
reconcilable to themselves, to one another, and to the
fountain of truth. If any man ask me, why our differences
cannot be ended on earth? (answer, Were we all thorough-
ly convinced, that then they would be reconciled, we would
put an end to them before; but this is impossible to be done;
for as men's certain convictions of truth are not equal to
one another, or the weight of significancy of such veracity,
so neither can a general effect of this affair be expected on this side of time.
Before I conclude this chapter, 1 shall beg leave to dis-
course a little of the wonderful excellency of negative re-
ligion and negative virtue. The latter sets out, like the
Pharisee, with—God, I thank thcej it is a piece of religi-
ous pageantry, the hypocrite's hope: and in a word, it is
positive vice: for it is either a mask to deceive others, or a
mist to deceive ourselves. A man that is clothed with ne-
gatives, thus argues: I am not such a drunkard as my land-
lord, such a thief as my tenant, such a swearer as his neigh-
bour; neither am la cheat, an atheist, a rakish fellow, or
a highwayman; no! I live a sober, regular, retired life: I
am a good man, I go to church; God, 1 thank thee. Now,
though a man boasts of his virtue in contradiction to the
vices mentioned, yet a person had better have them alto-
gether than the man himself; for he is full of himself, so
persuaded that he is good and religious enough already,
that he has no thoughts of any thing, except it be to pull off
his hat to God Almighty now and then, and thank him that
he has no occasion for him; and has the vanity to think
that his neighbours must imagine well of h:m too.
The negative man, though he is no drunkard, is yet in-
toxicated with the pride of his own worth; a good neigh-
bour and peace-maker in other families, but a tyrant in his
own; appears in a church for a show, but never falls upon -
his knees in his closet; does all his alms before men, to be seen of them; eager in the duties of the second table, but
regardless of the first: appears religious, to betaken notice
of by men, but without intercourse or communication
between God and his own soul: pray, what is this man? or what comfort is there of the life he lives? he isinsensib!e
of faith, repentance, and a Christian mortified life: in a word
he is perfectly a stranger to the essential part of religion.
Let us for a while enter into the private and retired part
of his conversation: what notions has he of his mispent
hours, and of the progress of time to the great centre and gulf of life, eternity "'. Does he know how to put a right
value on time, or esteem the life-blood of his soul, as it
really is, and act in a!! the moments of it, as one that must
account for them? iftlu.n you can form an equality between
what he can do and what he shall receive, less can be
founded upon his negative virtue, or what he hasforeborne
to do: and if neither his negative nor positive piety can
be equal to the reward, and to the eternity that reward is to
last for, what then is to become of the Pharisee, when he is
to be judged by the sincerity ofhis repentance, and reward-
ed, according to the infinite grace of God, with a state of
blessedness to an endless eternity?
When the negative man converses with the invisible
world, he is rilled with as much horror and dread as Felix,
when St. Paul reasoned to him of temperance, righteous-
ness, and of judgment to come; for Felix, though a great
philosopher, of great power and. reverence, was a negative
man, and he was made sensible by the apostle, that, as a.
life of virtue and temperance was its own reward, by giving
a healthy body, a clear head, and a composed life, so eter-
ral happiness must proceed from another spring; namely,
the infinite unbounded grace of a provoked God, who hav-
ing erected a righteous tribunal, Jesus Christ would sepa-
rate such as by faith and repentance he had brought home
and united to himself by the grace of adoption, and on the
foot of his having laid down his life as a ransom fpr them,
had appointed them to salvation, when all the philosophy,
temperance, and righteousness in the world besides had
been ineffectual. And this, I say, it was, that made Felix,
this negative man,. tremble.
CHAP. IV.
Gf listening to the voice of Prtrvidcnce.
The magnificent and wise king Solomon bids us cry after
knowledge, and lift up our voice for understanding; by
which is meant, religious knowledge; for it follows: "T'
shalt thou understand the fear of the Lord, and find the
knowledge of God." By which undoubtedly he meant to
inquire after every thing he has permitted us to know, and
not to search into those ways that are unsearchable, and are
effectually locked up from our knowledge.—Now, "as
listening to the voice of Providence"4s my present subject,
I intend, in the first place, to write to those who own—1.
That there is a God, a first great movingcause of all things,
an eternal power, prior, and consequently superior to all
created power or being.—2. That this eternal power, which
is God, is the sovereign creator and governor of heaven and
earth.
To avoid all needlessdistinctions, what persons in the God-
head exercise the creating, and what the governing power,
I offer that glorious text, Psal. xxiii. 6. where the whole
Trinity is entitled to the whole creating work: and therefore,
in the next place, I shall lay down these two propositions:
I. That the eternal God guides by his providence, the
whole universe, which was created by his power.
II. That this Providence manifests a particular care over,
and concern in, the governing and directing man, the most
noble creature upon earth.
It is plain, that natural religion proves the first, by inti-
mating the necessity of a Providence guiding and govern-
ing the world, from the consequence of the wisdom, justice,
prescience, and goodness of the Almighty Creator: for
otherwise it would be absurd to think, that God should
create a world, without any care or providence over it, in
guiding the operations of nature, so as to preserve the or-
der of his creation.
Revealed religion gives us a light into the care and con-
cern of his providence, by the climate's being made habit-
able, the creatures subjected and made nourishing, and all
vegetative life made medicinal; and all this for the sake of
man, who is made viceroyto the king of the earth. The
short description I shall give of providence is this: "That
it is that operation of the power, of the wisdom, justice,
and goodness of God, by which he influences, governs, and
directs, not only the means, but the events of all things,
which concerns us in this sublunary world; the sovereign!
of which we ought always to reverence, obey its motions, observe its dictates, and listen to its voice. The pruj^- t.
."man.lbrtseeth the evil, and hideth himself; that is, a 1 - i, '.
it, there is a secret providence intimates to us, that some
danger threatens, if we strive not to shun it."
The same day that Sir John Hotham kept out Hull
against the royal Martyr King Charles I. the same day Sir
John Hotham was put to death by the parliament for that
very action: the same day that the King himself signed the
warrant for the execution of the earl of Straffbrd, the same
day of the month was he barbarously murdered by the blood-
-thirsty Oliverian crew: and the same day that king James
II. came to the crown against the bill of exclusion, the same
day he was voted abdicated by the parliament, and the
throne filled with King William and Queen Mary.
The voice of signal deliverances from sudden danger, is
not only a just call to repentance, but a caution against fall-
ing into the like danger; but such-who are utterly careless
of themselves after, show a lethargy of the worst nature,
which seems to me to be a kind of practical atheism, or at
least living in a contempt of heaven, when he receives
good at the hand of his Maker, but is unconcerned from
whence it comes, or to thank the bountiful hand that gave
it; neither, when he receives evil, does it alter his manner
of life, or bring him to any state of humiliation.
We have a remarkable story of two soldiers being con-
demned to death in Flanders. The general being prevailed
upon tospare one of them, ordered them to cast dice upon
the drum head for their lives; the first having thrown two
sixes, the second fell a wringing his hands, having so poor a
chance to escape; however, having thrown, he was surpris-
ed when he also throw-other two sixes. Theotlicer appoint-
ed to see the execution, ordered them to throw again; they
did so and each of them threw fives; at which. tlie soldiers
that stood round, shouted, and said, neither ot them was to
die. Upon this, the officer acquainted the council of war,
who ordered them to throw a third time, when they threw
two fours: the general being acquainted with it, sent for
the men, and pardoned them: I love, saidhe, in such ex-
traordinary cases, to listen to the voice of Providence.
We read in the holy writings, how God speaks to men
by appearance of angels, or by dreams and visions of the
night. As God appeared to Abraham, Lot, and Jacob:
so angels have appeared to many in other cases, as to Ma-
noan and his wite, Zachariah, the Virgin Mary, and to the
apostles; others have been warned in a dream, as King
Abimelecb, the false prophet Balaam, and many others."
It is certainly a very great and noble inquiry, "What we
shall be after this life?" for there is scarce a doubt, that
there is a place reserved for the reception of our souls after
death: for if we are to be, we must have a where, which
the scriptures assert by the examples of Dives and Lazarus.
The doctrine of spirits was long believed before our Sa-
viour's time; for when the disciples of the blessed Jesus
perceived our Saviour walking on the sea, they were as
much surprised as though they had seen a spirit. Nay, in
those ages of the world, it was believed that spirits inter-
meddled in the affairs of mankind; and throughout the Old
Testament, I do not find any thing that in the least con-
tradicts it. All the pains and labour that some learned men
have taken, to confute the story of the witch of Endor, and
the appearance of an old man personating Samuel, cannot
make such apparitions inconsistent with nature or religion;
and it is plain, that it was either a good or a bad spirit, that
prophetically told the unfortunate king what should happen
the next day; for, said the spirit, "The Lord will deliver
thee into the hands of the Philistines; and to-morrow shalt
thou and thy sons be with me."
Abundance of strange notions possessed me, when I was
in the desolate island; especially on a moonshine night,
when every bush seemed a man, and every tree a man on
horseback. When I crept into the dismal cave where the
old goat lay expiring, whose articulate groans even resem-
bled those of a man, how was I surprised! my blood chil-
led in my veins, a cold sweaty dew sat on my forehead,
my hair stood upright, and my joints, like Belshazzar's
knees, struck against one another. And, indeed, though I
afterwards found what it was, the remains of this surprise did not wear off for a great while; and I had frequently
returns of those vapours on different occasions, and some-
times without any occasion at all.
One night, after having seen some appearance in the air,
as I had just laid down in my bed, one of my tci t pained
me; after that came a numbness, succeeded with a tingling
in my blood; when on a sudden I thought something alive
lay upon me, from my knee to above half my leg. Upon
tiiis 1 flung myself out of bed where I thought tlio CiCdture
lay; but finding nothing, "Lord deliver me from an evil
spirit," said I; "what can this be?" When 1 lighted a
candle, I could perceive no living creature in the place i
with me, but the poor parrot, who being frightened, cried
nut, "Hold your tongue," and "What's the matter with
you?" which words I had taught him by saying so to him,
when he had made such screaming noises as I did not like. "Lord," said I aloud, "surely the devil has been here."
"Hold your tongue," says poll. I was then mad at the
bird, and putting on my clothes, cried, "I am terribly
frightened." "What's the matter with you ?" says Poll.
"You toad," said I, "I'll knock your brains out." "Hold
your tongue," cried he again, and so fell a chattering.,
and calling Robinson Crusoe, as he did before. But, after
I had composed myself, and went to bed again, I began
plainly to see it was a distemper that affected my nerves,
and so my terrors vanished at once. i
How intelligences are given or received, we do not know;
nor are we sensible how they are conveyed from spirits em-
bodied to ours that are in life; or, on the contrary, from us
to them; the latter is certainly done without the help of the
organs, and the former is conveyed by the understanding,
and the retired faculties of the soul.
The spirits, without the help of voices, converse, and the
more particular discoveries of converse of the spirits, seem to me as follow: to wit, dreams, voices, noises, impulses,
hints, apprehensions, involuntary sadness, &c. Dreams of old were the ways by which God himself was
pleased to warn men what services to perform, and what to
shun. Joseph was directed of God in a dream to go to
Egvpt j and so were the wise men warned in a dream to
depart into their own country another way, to avoid the
fury of Herod. I am not like those who think dreams are
the mere designs of a delirious head, or the relics of a day's
perplexities or pleasures; but on the contrary, I must beg
Lave to say, I never met with any capital mischief in my
life, but I ha.1 some notice of it by a dream; and had I not
been a thoughtless, unbelieving creature, I mtght have taken
many a warning, and avoided many of the evils I after-
wards fell into, merely by total neglect of those dreams.
i was once present at a dispute between a layman and a
clergyman, upon the subject ot dreams, The first thought
r.o ivg.ird should be given unto them; that their communi-
cation from the invisible to the visible world was a mere
chimera; without any solid foundation. For. tiist, said he, if Jceanis weie from the agency of anyprescient bsing, the
motives would be more direct, and the discoveries more
plain, and not by allegories and emblematic .fancies, ex-
pressing things imperfect and obscure. 2. Since, with the
notice of evil, there was not a power given to.avoid it, it
is not likely to proceed from a spirit, but merely fortuitous. 3. That the inconstancy of such notices, in cases equally
important, proves they did not proceed from any such agent. 4. That as our most distinct dreams had nothing in them of
any significany, it would be irrational and vain to think
that they came from heaven. And, 5. That as men were not always thus warned or supplied with notice of good or
evil, so all men are not alike supplied with them; and what
reason could we give, why one man or one woman should
not have the same hints as another? To all this the clergyman gave answer: 1. That as to
the signification of dreams, and the objections against them,
as being dark and doubtful, they are expressed generally by
hieroglyphical representations, similies, allusions, and figura-
tive emblematic ways, by which means, for want of inter-
pretation, the thing was not understood, and, consequently,
the evil not shunned. 2. That we charge God foolishly,
to say, that he has given the notice of evil, without the
power to avoid it; for, if any one had not power to avoid
the evil, it was no notice to him; and it was want of giving
due heed to thatnotice, that men first neglected themselves,
and then charged the Judge of all the earth with injustice.
3. That we ought not to find fault with the inconstancy of
these notices, but rather with our weak understandings,
by pretending dreams were not to be regarded, and negli-
gent when the voice really spoke to us for our good. It is
a mistake to say dreams have no import at all: we might,
with more reason, have said, none that we could perceive
the reason of, owing to our blindness and supine negligence,
too secure at one time, and too much alarmed at another;
so that the spirit, which we might be said to be conversing
with in a dream, was constantly and equally kind and care-
ful; but our powers are not always in the same state of
action, not equally attentive to, or retentive of the hints
I hat were given. And, 5. To answer the last question,
why people are not equally supplied? this seems to be
no question: for providence itself might have some share in
the direction of it, and then that providence might be li-
mited by a superior direction; that as to the converse of.

Y2
spirits, he could not call it a stated converse: such a thing
there was, but why there was so much of it, and no more,
was none of his business, and that no such discovery had
ever yet been made to mankind. Nbrwere we to imagine
less of waking dreams, trances, visions, noises, hints, im-
pulses, and all the waking testimonies of an invisible world,
and of the communication that there is between us and
them, which commonly entertain us with our open eyes.
One time my fancy soared on high, to see what disco-
veries I could make in those clearer regions. I found that
such immense bodies of the sun, stars, planets and moon,
in the great circle of the lower heaven, are far from being
found in the study of nature on the surface of the earth.
Here I saw many things that we can entertain little or no
notion of, in a state of common lift-, and the emptiness of
our notion, that the planets are habitable worlds; that is,
created like ours, for the subsistence and existence of man
and beast, and the preservation of the vegetative and sensi-
tive life: no, no; this is, I assure you, a world of spirits;
for here I saw a clear demonstration of satan being the
prince of the ficiuer of the air, keeping his court or camp,
with innumerable angels to attend him; but his power is
not so great as we imagine, he can tempt us to the crime,
but cannot force us to commit: Humanum cst fcccatc. Nei-
ther has the devil power to force the world into a rebellion
against heaven, though his legions are employed among
savage nations, to set up their master for a god, who make
the heathens either worship him in person, or by his repre-
sentatives, idols and monsters, with the cruel sacrifices of
human blood. Now, as tothelimitationsofthedevil's power,
you must understand, that, as there are numbers of evil
spirits employed in mischief, so there are numbers of good
angels sent from the higher and blessed abodes to discon-
cert and oppose their measures; and this every Christian,
I hope, believes, when he prays to God, the father of spi-
rits, to give his angels charge over him while he slumbereth and sleepeth. For if by these preventing powers the devil was not restrained, the earth would be subjected to
dearth, droughts, and famine; the air in-fected'vwth noxious
fumes; and, in a word, mankind would be utterly destroyed,
which might oblige our Maker (if I may be allowed the
expression) to the necessity of a new fat, or else have no
more creatures to honour and worship him.
As the devil never wanted insinuators, I shall observe, that I learned a way how to make a man dream of what I
pleased. For instance, letussupposeone to be sound asleep;
let another lay his mouth close to his ear, and whisper any
tiiing so softly as not to awake him, the sleeping man shall
dream of what has been so whispered in his ear; nay, I can
assure you, those insinuating devils can do this even when
we are awake, which I call impulses of the mind: for from
whence, but from these insinuators, come our causeless pas-
sions, involuntary wickedness, or sinful desires? who else
Ibrm ideas in the mind of man when he is asleep, or pre-
sent terrible or beautiful figures to his fancy? Mr. Milton
represents the devil tempting Eve in the shape of a toad,
lying just at her ear, when in her bower she lay fast asleep;
and brings in Eve telling Adam what an uneasy night's rest she had, and relating her dream to him. And likewise
I believe that good spirits have the same intercourse wiili
us, in warning us against those things that are evil, and
prompting us to that which is good.
Were we to have the eyes of our souls opened, through
the eyes of our bodies, we should see this very immediate
region of air which we breathe in, thronged with spirits
now invisible, and which otherwise would be the most ter-
rible; we should view the secret transactions of those mes-
sengers who are employed when the parting soul takes its
leave of the reluctant body, and perhaps see things nature
would shrink back from with the utmost terror and amaze-
ment. In a word, the curtain of providence for the dis-
position of things here, and the curtain of judgment for the
determination of the state of souls hereafter, would be alike
drawn buck; and what heart could support here its future
state in life; much less that of its future state after life,
even good or bad. A gentleman of my acquaintance, being about seven miles distant from London, a friend that came to dine with him,
solicited him to go to the city. "What," said the gentle-
man, "is there any occasion for me?" " No, Sir," said the
other, "nothing at all, except the enjoyment of your good
company:" and so gave over importuning him. Just then
a strong impulse of mind urged the gentleman, and pursued
him like a voice, with," Go to London, Go to London." "Hark ye," says he to his friend, "is all well at London?"
Am 1 wanted there? or, did you ask me to go with you on any particular account? Are all my family well?" "Yes,
indeed, Sir," said he, " I perceived them all very hearty;
and I did not ask you to go to London upon any particular
account whatsoever, except it was for the sake of your good
company." Again he put off his resolution: but still the
impulse suggested to him, " Go to London;" and at length
he did so. When he came there, he found a letter, and a
messenger had been there to seek him, and to tell him of a
particular business, which was at first and last above a thou-
sand pounds to him, and which might inevitably have been
lost, had he not gone to London that night.
The obeying of several hints, or secret impulses, argues
great wisdom. I knew a man that was under misfortune?,
being guilty of misdemeanors against the government;
when, absconding for fear of his ruin, all his friends advi-
sing him not to put himself in the hands of the law, one
morning as he awaked, he felt a strong impulse-darting in-
to his mind thus, " Write a letter to them;" and thiaSftta
repeated several times to his mind, and at last he answered
to it, as if it had been a voice, "Whom shall I write tor"
Immediately it. replied, "Write to the judge:" and this
impulse pursued him for several days, till at length he took
pen, ink, and paper, and sat down to write to him: when
immediately words flowed from his pen like streams from
a fair fountain, that charmed even himself with hopes of
success. In short, the letter was so strenuous in argument,
so pathetic in its eloquence, and so persuasively moving,
that when the judge had read it, he sent him an answer;, h*
might be easy, he would endeavour to make that matter
light to him: and, indeed, never left exerting himself till
he had stopt the prosecution, and restored him to his liberty
and family.
While I am mentioning these things, methinks it is very
hard that we should obey the whispers of evil spirits, and
not much rather receive the notices which good ones are
pleased to give. We never perceive the misfortune of this,
but when in real danger; and then we cry, "My mind mis-
gave me when I was going about it:" but if so, why do you
slight the caution t Why not listen to it as to a voice ? and
then there had been no reason to make this complaint.
1 remember about fourteen or fifteen years. ago (as to
time I cannot be very positive) there was a young clergy-
man in the cit)s.pf Dublin, in Ireland, who dreamed a very 
uncommon dream, that a gentleman had killed his wife, a
relation of his, by stabbing her in several places; the fright
of this awaked him, but finding it a dream, he composed
himself again to sleep, when he dreamed a second time the
same dream. This made him a little uneasy; but thinking
it proceeded from the impression made on his mind by the
former, he went to sleep again, and dreamed the same
dream a third time also. So troubled was he at this, that he rose, and knocked at his mother's chamber-door, told his
concern, and his apprehensions that all was not right at his
relation's house. "Dear Son," says the good old gentle-
woman, "do not mind those foolish dreams; and I very
much wonder, that you, being a person in holy orders, should
have regard to such illusions." Upon this he went to bed
again, fell asleep, and dreamed a fourth time as before.—
then indeed he put on his night-gown, and went to
Afield, the place where his relation dwelt. Here it
was, alas! he perceived his dream too sadlv fulfilled, by
seeing his relation the young lady, big with child, who was
a protestant, stabbed in several places by her barbarous
husband, Mr. Eustace, a violent Papist, onlv for some dis-
courses of religion that happened the day before. After
the wretch had stabbed her in three places, he went to
make his escape out at a window; but she cried out,
*' My dear! don't leave me, come back and I shall be well
again." At which he returned in a hellish rage, and gave
her four wounds more; when even in this condition, rising
from her bed, she wrapped herself in her nightgown, and
went to the Lord Bisj»p of Rapho's chamber door, (the
Bishop lodging at that^ime in the house) " My lord," said
she, "O my lord, make haste unto me;" but as' soon as
his Lordship came, she expired in his arms, resigning her
precious soul into the hands of Almighty God. The cruel
wretch, her husband, was shot by the pursuers; too good a
death for one who deserved the gibbet: and the lady was
universally lamented by all tender and religious people.
And this tragical relation I have mentioned, upon the ac-
count of that impulse, or dream, that the clergyman had at
the fata! time of the bloody action.
Some people make a very ill use of the general notion,
that there are no apparitions nor spirits at all: which is
worse than those who fancy they see them upon every oc-
casion; for those carry their notions farther, even to an-
mhilate the devil, and believe nothing about him, neither
of one kind or other: the next step they come to, is to
conclude, "There is no God," and so atheism takes its
rise in the same sink, with a carelessness about futurity.
But there is no occasion to enter upon an argument to prove
the being of the Almighty, or to illustrate his power by
words, whohasso many undeniable testimonies in the breasts
of every rational being to prove his existence: and we have
sufficient proofs enough to convince us of the great superintendency of divine providence in the minutest affairs of
this world; the mamfest existence of the invisible world;
the reality of spirits, and intelligence between us and them.
What I have said, I hope, will not mislead any person, or
be a means whereby they may delude themselves; for I
have spoken of these things with the utmost seriousness of
mind, and with a sincere and ardent desire for the good and benefit of the world.
